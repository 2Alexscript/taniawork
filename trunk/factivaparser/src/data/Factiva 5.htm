<p>ROSANN Wowchuk treated her first budget as finance minister the same way most people look after their household finances.</p>
<p>The worldwide economic recession and the economic downturn in Manitoba, plus the H1N1 pandemic, forced the government's hand in projecting a $545-million deficit for the upcoming year, she said. And Wowchuk makes no apologies for the government's decision to amend balanced budget legislation and dip into the red after running surpluses since the NDP came to power in 1999.</p>
<p>"Sometimes in your household, unforeseen expenses come up and you have to make adjustments," she said.</p>
<p>Wowchuk defended the government's projected return to the surplus side of the ledger in five years, saying when consumers borrow money for whatever reason, they don't pay it all back in a single year. She said she had no plans to increase government revenues by raising personal income taxes or sales taxes, either.</p>
<p>"Our debt-to-GDP (ratio) is better today than it was in 1999. We're not immune to the global recession. There is an economic downturn," she said.</p>
<p>"Our stable economic base has helped Manitoba fare better than most, but our province is feeling the effects of the downturn. Our economy declined in 2009, but less than the Canadian economy as a whole."</p>
<p>Wowchuk's budget is now betting that Manitoba's economy will grow by 2.5 per cent this year and 3.0 per cent in 2011.</p>
<p>But Wowchuk's economic defence didn't satisfy those in the business community, who complained this year's budget had too much spending and few incentives for businesses to expand and create jobs.</p>
<p>"The best way to stimulate the economy is to put money in the hands of consumers and businesses to invest," said Dave Angus, president and CEO of the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce. "We understood we wouldn't see tax cuts this year but we expected a long-term commitment to competitiveness. This government is silent on future competitiveness in Manitoba."</p>
<p>Graham Starmer, president of the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce, said he was concerned the province could be hamstrung with debt repayments by the time the budget returns to surplus.</p>
<p>"With a suspension of balanced budget legislation, the projected deficit (for the next four years) might hit $2 billion," he said.</p>

</p>
<p>Driving around last week, I caught a snippet of an interview by radio host Charles Adler of a journalist, whose name I didn't catch, about federal Status of Women Minister Helena Guergis and her recent outburst at the Charlottetown airport.</p>
<p>"I don't mean to be sexist," the journo said, "but Guergis is a former beauty queen who used to run a gift shop." Many of her colleagues, he added, call her a "real handful."</p>
<p>Adler then muttered something about how Guergis was "eye candy" for the "suburban moms" in her Simcoe-Grey, Ont., riding -- you know, gullible losers who'd vote for any woman who breathed.</p>
<p>Which is when this suburban mom turned off the radio.</p>
<p>Since when are gift shop owners, "beauty queens" or not, beneath contempt? And when did burning small business owners become acceptable?</p>
<p>True, Guergis' outburst -- she called P.E.I. a "hell hole" and yelled "happy f-----g birthday to me!" when asked to remove her shoes -- wasn't exactly conduct becoming a cabinet minister.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as a cabinet minister, she's unlikely to be a terrorist. And we all know the officiousness of some airline security types would test the patience of Job.</p>
<p>I didn't lose my temper when they checked my son's teddy bear for explosives, but that's only because I was scared I might be arrested.</p>
<p>Another time, however, when my son and I had to take an airport bus that flung us from side to side and no one offered us a seat, I did publicly "thank" everyone, as I got off, for their "great gallantry." And yes, I would have done the same thing as a cabinet minister.</p>
<p>Sometimes people get mad, sometimes over nothing. (Have you ever seen Italians in traffic?) And seeing the press corps running after Guergis' cabinet colleagues like a bunch of sanctimonious biddies asking, "Are you arrogant?" was ridiculous.</p>
<p>Back on Adler's show, Veterans Affairs Minister Jean-Pierre Blackburn -- who also recently flipped out when airport security agents asked him to relinquish a bottle of tequila -- was described as "respectful" and "well-liked."</p>
<p>I bet he's never run a gift shop, either.</p>
<p>In journalism, as in politics, it helps to have a tough skin. But is there a double standard? After a number of people recently asked how I "deal with" the "terrible letters" about me and whether I get more negative letters than male columnists, I had to think about it.</p>
<p>Of the personal e-mails I get, the great majority are civil and serious, even when the writer doesn't agree with me. But if there's a common thread to the negative letters that appear in print, it's that I'm "unqualified" to speak about my subject, which I'm not sure is said as often about male writers.</p>
<p>About Walking with Dinosaurs, for example, one letter writer said I displayed "incredible ignorance" and my "denigration (was) unfounded and bordering on ridiculous." He then took literally that I expected the dinosaurs to sing and dance. So, presumably, I'm not qualified to make jokes, either.</p>
<p>About Avatar, another writer said I "should acquire a minimal knowledge of cryogenic suspension needed for long-term space flight, while (my) notions attributed to Rouseau (sic) reveal a profound ignorance of multiculturalism and its diversity, whether on Earth or some distant planet's moon." (OK, that one's just funny).</p>
<p>I've been given an "F for research" when my research wasn't faulty, only disagreed with. And in response to my concerns over the H1N1 vaccine, a pharmacist said he couldn't believe such an "uneducated viewpoint" was published. He also missed where I mentioned my "medical training."</p>
<p>That's like saying you have to be a porn star to talk about porn or an arms inspector to talk about Iran.</p>
<p>But whether female writers, or female politicians, get more negative feedback than men is endlessly debatable. Perhaps it would make an interesting academic study.</p>
<p>After all, University of Saskatchewan medical student Brent Thoma was labelled "offensive," "inept" and a "Neanderthal" after he described pap tests as "horrid rituals" in a recent "humorous" piece for a national medical journal.</p>
<p>Perhaps what's really behind the "beauty queen who ran a gift shop" comments, or Thoma's comments for that matter, is a growing lack of civility that extends from the often anonymous slurs and insults made on the Internet to the broader public realm.</p>
<p>But gotta run: I have to bone up on cryogenic suspension . . .</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu threat was overblown, health official says</b>
</div><div>Craig Pearson   </div>
<div>The Windsor Star</div>

</p>
<p>In some ways, H1N1 was the flu that fizzled.</p>
<p>But the feared 2009 influenza that the World Health Organization classified as a pandemic certainly was peculiar, Dr. Allen Heimann, the Windsor-Essex County Medical Officer of Health, said Monday.</p>
<p>"This was an extremely unusual flu season," Heimann said after giving a lunchtime talk entitled The History of Influenza, Past and Present to the Rotary Club 1918.</p>
<p>Heimann said a fair number of people locally contracted what some people early on incorrectly called swine flu. The local health unit recorded 425 cases -- more than any of the last five years -- as well as 74 hospitalizations and four deaths.</p>
<p>But as H1N1 was breaking, Heimann said some calculations from organizations such as the WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control suggested this area could suffer many more deaths.</p>
<p>"If you looked at some of the predictions, it could have meant hundreds of deaths in Windsor-Essex County, but we just didn't see that," Heimann said. "This virus just didn't turn out to be as virulent as expected."</p>
<p>Furthermore, a "mysterious third wave" that some people predicted never materialized.</p>
<p>A strain of H1N1 sparked the influenza known as Spanish flu which killed more than 50 million people from 1918 to 1920, marking the deadliest natural disaster in human history.</p>
<p>And though the 2009 H1N1 wasn't as deadly as expected -- partly thanks to the mass immunization, which numbered almost 114,000 locally -- Heimann nevertheless considered the virus unpredictable, especially because it came and left so early.</p>
<p>He said the first reports came in April 2009, followed by a small spike in June, and then a big spike in October-November, peaking locally the weekend of Nov. 13.</p>
<p>"This flu season, for all intents and purposes, was over the first of December," Heimann said. "The second thing that was unusual about it was that 88 per cent of the cases were under 35 years of age. That is extremely unusual. Most of the time we see influenza in individuals over the age of 65."</p>
<p>The WHO continues to monitor global H1N1 and H5N1 flu strains around the world, since they have held on in eastern Europe and southeast Asia.</p>

<p>Alberta's H1N1 and seasonal influenza immunization program will wrap up at the end of March.</p>
<p>"The H1N1 and seasonal immunization program will end on March 31, 2010, with exception of availability for travellers," said Dr. Marcia Johnson, Edmonton's medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"People who have travel plans who have not yet received the H1N1 or seasonal immunization this influenza season are encouraged to be immunized before they travel."</p>
<p>Immunization is the single best defence against influenza, and Alberta Health Services recommends that all Albertans over six months of age get immunized.</p>
<p>Recommendations for H1N1 immunization for children were also updated in February, based on new information from clinical trials, which showed an excellent immune response in children under 10 years of age with only one dose of H1N1 vaccine.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Feds asking for extra $6 billion; One-time events boost budgetary requirements</b>
</div><div>David Akin   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>384 words</div><div>23 March 2010</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The federal government is asking Parliament to approve an extra $6 billion in spending this year to cover unforeseen costs associated with more than a dozen initiatives -- such as Olympic security, the H1N1 pandemic and abnormally high employment insurance claims.</p>
<p>And yet, even though that $6 billion will be spent on items that will not repeat next year, Treasury Board President Stockwell Day warned Monday that Canadians shouldn't assume that government spending next year will automatically drop by $6 billion.</p>
<p>Instead, Day told a House of Commons committee Monday that the government expects to trim spending only by a modest $1.3 billion over the next two years through a "strategic review" of all government spending.</p>
<p>For the current fiscal year, which ends on March 31, the government will end up spending more than $270 billion and, once all the bills are paid, will record a deficit for the year that's likely to exceed $55 billion.</p>
<p>Cutting spending is a key part of the government's plan to eliminate that deficit within the next five years.</p>
<p>But Day said it is unlikely that the $6 billion in one-time costs the government had to pay this year will result in a savings of $6 billion next year. He said the government expects there will be other unique "concerns and pressures" the government will have to deal with -- and pay for -- in the next budget.</p>
<p>Aid for victims of the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti is a good example of the unexpected bills Ottawa had to pay for this year and likely will again next year, said Day. For the current fiscal year, the government has spent an extra $176 million for the disaster.</p>
<p>"We are committed there and there's an increase in spending," Day told reporters after meeting with a House of Commons committee Monday. "Next year, needs will also be presented. So we're not going to automatically say just because there was an extraordinary event this year in Haiti, that that increase would be levelling off. If there are concerns and pressures, as we think there will be, then people will come forward and make their case for those."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Budget may put pet projects on hold -</b>
</div><div>By Larry Kusch   </div>
<div>349 words</div><div>23 March 2010</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>WATCH for the Selinger government to delay implementation of some of its pet projects as part of its belt-tightening budget to be introduced this afternoon.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Rosann Wowchuk likened the choices she's had to make to those facing a homeowner planning to buy a new car. "You may have a change in your revenues so you might have to delay making (that purchase) because you have to repair the roof...," she said Monday. "And that's what we're doing with government."</p>
<p>Wowchuk didn't elaborate on the types of initiatives that might be put off in what will be her first budget as finance minister.</p>
<p>"We are looking at what we might be able to delay ... and whether there are things we can move forward on," she told reporters.</p>
<p>Wowchuk's budget marks the resumption of the legislative sitting which has been on recess since Dec. 15. The document will set forth the government's spending plans and revenue estimates for the fiscal year beginning April 1.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the economic downturn has played havoc with the province's finances.</p>
<p>Last spring, the NDP projected a surplus of $48 million for the current fiscal year, ending next Wednesday. Since then, it's had to revise its projections in the face of less-than-anticipated revenues and non-budgeted expenses from last year's spring flood and H1N1 scare. It's now projecting a $555-million deficit for the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>Wowchuk has promised not to fight the deficit at the expense of key government services such as health and education. But it's expected that other government departments -- many already with staff vacancy rates of four to eight per cent -- will have to tighten their belts.</p>
<p>The finance minister said all departments are going to have to look carefully at how they can manage with the resources allotted to them. In addition to delaying some programs, the government will likely hike a number of user fees.</p>

<p>This editorial is from the Calgary Herald.</p>
<p>We have no problem with MPs using our money to send us political junk mail. The use of taxpayer money to communicate with constituents via snail mail is a necessary expense that allows MPs to get unfiltered messages to citizens who have little inclination to visit their MP's website. It also saves us the headache of elected representatives clogging up our e-mail inboxes.</p>
<p>But we draw the line at MPs using our dime to send partisan volleys into rival constituencies. Mercifully, MPs did the right thing last week and passed a Liberal motion to scrap the so-called "10 percenters" rule, although the result was surprisingly close at 140-137.</p>
<p>The Conservatives have been the worst offenders of the 10-per cent mail-outs, so named because MPs can send one-page flyers to voters outside their ridings in numbers equal to 10 per cent of the electors in their own constituencies. The flyers have been used increasingly to launch partisan attacks against political opponents at a cost to taxpayers estimated at $10 million annually.</p>
<p>The Tories last fall distributed a flyer in ridings with large Jewish populations inferring that Liberals are anti-Semitic. They sent another into Bloc Québécois ridings, suggesting the separatist party is soft on pedophiles.</p>
<p>During last fall's H1N1 flu scare, the Liberals sent a flyer into ridings with large aboriginal populations accusing the government of providing body bags instead of vaccine.</p>
<p>The vote must be approved by the House of Commons' Board of Internal Economy, an all-party committee that meets in secret. Given the Tories' abuse of the mail-outs, we are pleased, for a change, that Opposition MPs dominate the committee.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Manitoba considers options for huge H1N1 vaccine surplus -</b>
</div><div>By Jen Skerrit    </div>
<div>389 words</div><div>20 March 2010</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>MANITOBA'S stockpile of H1N1 vaccine could sit in a warehouse for several more months before health officials make a firm decision on whether to keep the extra shots or donate them to a place in need.</p>
<p>Provincial officials have been unclear about what to do with Manitoba's excess vaccine since infections from the second wave of H1N1 dropped off in January.</p>
<p>Gerry Delorme, director of Manitoba Health's office of disaster management, said provinces are still trying to reach consensus over what portion of the H1N1 stockpiles are still required and what could be sent to other parts of the world. Delorme said the decision-making process has been slow since officials don't want to hastily determine the flu threat has subsided, only to be caught with no supply in the event of a third wave this spring.</p>
<p>Manitoba committed last summer to buy about one million doses of vaccine and more than 450,000 Manitobans have been vaccinated against H1N1 since mass clinics last fall. Another 362,000 doses are sitting in a classified warehouse in Winnipeg in special cold-storage to ensure they remain usable.</p>
<p>About 100,000 surplus doses are sitting in doctor's offices and health regions across the province. Another 90,000 doses were wasted, either by accident or to avoid contamination.</p>
<p>"It's never an all-or-nothing solution," Delorme said. "What we're having to grapple with is what is an appropriate amount to keep for an emergency."</p>
<p>In Manitoba, no new cases of H1N1 influenza have been reported since late January.</p>
<p>Delorme said the vaccine has a lifespan of 18 months, which gives officials time to weigh their options and see whether or not a third flu wave surfaces. He expects the province will hang on to a portion of its vaccine stockpile and donate the rest to a country in need.</p>
<p>Provinces don't decide which countries receive extra doses, Delorme said, noting the federal government will likely consult with the World Health Organization to determine where doses will be sent. Delorme said the first priority is to protect Manitobans against infection, and that it's too early to say when they'll be able to make a final decision.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Province may expand HPV vaccination to high-risk groups -</b>
</div><div>By Jen Skerritt    </div>
<div>417 words</div><div>20 March 2010</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>WOMEN and teens at high risk of contacting a sexually transmitted virus linked to cervical cancer might be added to Manitoba's vaccination program currently aimed at 12-year-old girls.</p>
<p>Manitoba Health officials are re-evaluating their strategy to protect women against two types of human papillomavirus (HPV) -- 16 and 18 -- that researchers believe are responsible for up to 70 per cent of cervical cancer cases. The province rolled out its vaccine program in 2008 when it began offering the Gardasil vaccine to all Grade 6 girls.</p>
<p>So far, only about half of the eligible Manitoba girls have been immunized.</p>
<p>Chief medical officer Dr. Joel Kettner said officials are considering expanding the program to include young women who might be at a higher risk of being exposed to HPV through sexual activity or other lifestyle factors. Kettner said health experts are still crafting a way to measure who is at higher risk before announcing any official plans.</p>
<p>He said the review won't be done for another few months, but that officials may have a concrete idea about how the vaccine program might be restructured as early as summer or fall.</p>
<p>"We haven't developed a criteria and we're still looking into it and how it will work," Kettner said. "It potentially could include high-risk women up to (26 years of) age."</p>
<p>Researchers have said the HPV vaccine is most effective when administered before a woman becomes sexually active, but Kettner said there might be a benefit to offering it to high-risk sexually active women. Even if a young woman has been exposed to HPV before, Kettner said it might not be the same virus types that the vaccine protects against.</p>
<p>He said the province might develop guidelines similar to those for the H1N1 vaccine, to educate health-care providers and the public about who could benefit from receiving the Gardasil shot.</p>
<p>"First of all, it's unlikely to cause any adverse harm or risk for someone if they have been exposed (to HPV) before," Kettner said. "It may be that someone has been exposed to one (HPV type) but not the other so they may benefit from the vaccine."</p>
<p>HPV is a sexually transmitted infection with more than 100 different strains. Most people who develop an HPV infection will clear it from their bodies naturally, but certain types can cause genital warts or cancer.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Liquor commission ID not valid for travel -</b>
</div><div>Ron Pradinuk / Ask Journeys   </div>
<div>968 words</div><div>20 March 2010</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>E2</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Proof of age, proof of health and proving who we are seem to be a constant point of reference in today's travel environment.</p>
<p>We need to prove our children are less than two years of age to get a free ticket to board an aircraft. We need to show our picture ID at the airline ticket counter. And now we may need to prove we have health insurance to visit some countries.</p>
<p>It's a rapidly changing world, where simple trust lost its way some time ago, as we adjust to officials asking us for some form of official confirmation of more and more things.</p>
<p>QUESTION: My friend does not have a passport or driver's licence, so she has been using the ID issued by the Manitoba government through the liquor commission, as we were told that this was a government-issued ID that was approved by the airlines. When we went to board in Calgary to come back home, my friend was told that she couldn't use the liquor commission ID, as it wasn't government-approved. Have you heard about this change in policy? Is there some other ID that has a picture that my friend could get instead?</p>
<p>ANSWER: It is true that there is no place where a government liquor commission ID is listed as acceptable.</p>
<p>Therefore, as the gate agent you ran into expressed, MLCC identification is not acceptable, even though many may choose on their own to accept it, recognizing that to get that card, the same accurate information would have been required by the liquor commission.</p>
<p>So it is not that there has been a change; it is just that the person you encountered was acting to the letter of the law instead of according to logic.</p>
<p>Even though domestic travel requirements may differ from international, here is the actual wording of what is allowed:</p>
<p>Valid passports are required for all international travel, and all other rules for flights to the United States and other international destinations continue to apply.</p>
<p>The verification of passengers' identification is already a practice followed by most major air carriers in Canada.</p>
<p>The following are some examples of valid government-issued identification documents that may be used to meet the requirements of the identity screening regulations: passport, citizenship card, permanent-resident card, driver's licence, provincial health card, birth certificate, and federal, provincial or municipal government employee identification cards.</p>
<p>For a complete list go to www.passengerprotect.gc.ca/identity[http://www.passengerprotect.gc.ca/identity].</p>
<p>QUESTION: We are going to Cuba next week and I have heard that I must have health insurance coverage or they won't let me in. Is that correct?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Your information is correct, but the new law passed by the Cuban Council of Ministers doesn't come into effect until May 1.</p>
<p>This has been a bit of a strange decision by the Cuban government, and Cuba is the only country that actually obligates visitors to have travel health insurance in order to enter. During the H1N1 crisis, there were a couple of nations that required proof of vaccination for entry, but few other countries followed suit.</p>
<p>What is unique about this announcement is that the government will be establishing its own tourist health insurance company from which visitors will be able to purchase these policies at all points of entry into the country.</p>
<p>Tied to that, medical insurance policies that you may wish to buy in Canada must come from a company recognized by the Cuban government.</p>
<p>A number of large companies in Canada with United States head offices have already been precluded from selling health insurance for Cuba by existing U.S. government policies prohibiting trade with Cuba.</p>
<p>The Cuban Council of Ministers, who passed this legislation, is also empowered to set the prices for the insurance the Cuban companies can or must sell.</p>
<p>I have always advocated the importance of not travelling out of country without proper health insurance and have written about it so many times in this column.</p>
<p>On this one, I am not yet decided whether it is a cash grab by the Cuban government or the beginning of a trend around the world that protects countries from having to foot the bill for foreigners who may not be able to pay.</p>
<p>Few countries will not admit a patient to an emergency department. The care that is provided to those who can't or won't pay is absorbed by the host country. A program like Cuba's prevents that from happening.</p>
<p>Where this goes is something only time can answer, but my advice is still the same:</p>
<p>Don't board an aircraft to leave this country until you are absolutely certain you have coverage to take care of any and all unexpected medical needs.</p>
<p>QUESTION: We are travelling to Mexico. We have travelled with a passport for a number of years now. But in your recent article, you state: "Permanent residents of Canada need permanent-resident cards or certificate of identity or refugee travel documents. My husband is a Canadian, born in Canada. I am not... but a Canadian citizen.</p>
<p>Are these documents in addition to a passport?</p>
<p>ANSWER: To my understanding, you do not have to worry. I took this directly off the government website. It reads: "When you become a Canadian citizen, you are no longer a permanent resident." For other definitions regarding permanent-resident cards, go to www.cic.gc.ca[http://www.cic.gc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca] .</p>

</p>
<p>WINNIPEG -- A vast network of northern roads has become Manitoba's mucky equivalent of the Bermuda Triangle.</p>
<p>With unseasonably warm weather thawing the province's 2,200-kilometre system of winter roads, at least 20 travellers have become stranded on the sludgy tracks, which serve as the sole ground link between many remote native communities in the province and the outside world.</p>
<p>But officials don't know exactly how many people are stuck or where they're located.</p>
<p>“We don't have a complete picture of the situation yet,” RCMP Sergeant Line Karpish said.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the RCMP chartered a plane to rescue 12 people who'd blown their tires as they drove from Winnipeg to homes in the Island Lake region, 450 kilometres northeast.</p>
<p>When the ski-equipped Beaver landed to retrieve the marooned travellers from a remote fishing lodge where they were believed to be taking shelter, the place was empty.</p>
<p>“They weren't there,” Sgt. Karpish said. “So now we're looking for them. We don't know exactly how many there are or where they've gone. Communications are scant up there.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, the RCMP plucked two truckers from the roads. A stuck Selkirk truck driver was rescued on Tuesday when RCMP learned he had a serious medical condition and feared for his life. Two days later, an RCMP helicopter located a 29-year-old Selkirk man who'd been mired in the mud for two days.</p>
<p>“Bottom line is people shouldn't be out there,” Sgt. Karpish said. “These roads are closed. Mother Nature has played some real havoc out there.”</p>
<p>The province closed the winter roads on Tuesday after they melted into a slimy gumbo. They had been officially open for just 32 days – half the usual opening.</p>
<p>In that short period, more than 2,500 shipments usually traverse the frozen muskeg and lakes to resupply northern towns. Far fewer completed the trip this year.</p>
<p>The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs met with Indian and Northern Affairs (INAC) officials yesterday to ensure that airlifts will deliver any crucial goods. The assembly has struck a Winter Roads Crisis Management Team to co-ordinate supply sorties and rescue missions.</p>
<p>“It's something along the lines of the team we created during the H1N1 epidemic,” AMC Grand Chief Ron Evans said. “We're just trying to ensure that we're all working on the same page – INAC, the province and ourselves.”</p>
<p>The situation is doubly bad in Wasagamack, where the nearest airport lies across several kilometres of lake.</p>
<p>“Right now the ice is too thin to drive across and way too thick for a boat,” said Chief Jerry Knott of Wasagamack First Nation. “That means we have to helicopter in people and supplies at huge, huge expense.”</p>

</div><div>Kathryn Blaze Carlson    </div>
<div>National Post</div>

</p>
<p>In Manitoba's remote north, where First Nations communities rely on winter roads to connect with nearby cities and one another, this winter's mild weather has brought isolation, desperation and a state of emergency.</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, dozens of freight-haulers and local drivers have found themselves stranded on thawed winter roads for days at a time.</p>
<p>Some have been rescued by skidders--tractors used for pulling trees out of a forest--sent by trucking companies. Some have been retrieved by relatives whose trucks fared better. Some -- like the dozen people stranded until yesterday at a summer lodge 350 km north of Winnipeg, or the 52-year-old Selkirk man who feared death for the two days he spent stuck in the mud -- have been airlifted to safety by the RCMP.</p>
<p>Others, and no one is sure how many are stranded in the swampy 2,200-kilometre network of slush, are still waiting for rescue.</p>
<p>"These are the times where communities switch into survival mode -- if they hadn't already," said Grand Chief David Harper, who represents 30 northern Manitoba communities. "For some, it's a total waiting game where food and fuel supplies are uncertain. And for the families with missing people, it's a really anxious time."</p>
<p>Yesterday alone, Grand Chief Harper said he received word that another 16 trucks and their drivers were stranded throughout the melting hinterland, idle on roads atop semi-frozen rivers, lakes, creeks and muskegs. He said he hopes to deploy a helicopter to survey the road system for any others who may be stranded without means of communication.</p>
<p>The situation is so dire that the province closed the winter-road system, which brings in more than 2,500 shipments of food, construction materials and medical supplies to the more than 30,000 First Nations people it services each year.</p>
<p>And the chiefs -- pointing to dwindling construction supplies, skyrocketing food and fuel prices and a rise in unemployment -- have declared a state of emergency in 11 communities, including St. Theresa Point, Red Sucker Lake, Wasagamack and Oxford House.</p>
<p>Aboriginals on these remote reserves rely on winter roads to buy food in bulk in Winnipeg or Thompson, to bring in construction supplies that support local jobs and for access to hunting trails. They rely on the roads to reach dialysis centres or to visit elderly relatives in regional facilities. Perhaps most of all, they rely on the roads for a sense of connection to the world beyond their communities.</p>
<p>At the same time that the RCMP was flying a chartered plane over Wrong Lake to retrieve the dozen drivers from Thunderbird Lodge yesterday, the province's top First Nations leader met with representatives from Indian and Northern Affairs Canada to discuss the crisis.</p>
<p>"The federal government told us that they are ready to work with us," said Ron Evans, Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, following the afternoon meeting in Winnipeg. "The department has agreed that they will pay to fly in supplies like construction materials and fuel."</p>
<p>Ellen Funk, spokeswoman for the department's regional office, said a shipment of fuel will be flown out to Red Sucker Lake as soon as this weekend, and said the department will meet with First Nations leaders on a regular basis starting on Monday.</p>
<p>It has been an extraordinarily difficult year for Manitoba's remote northern communities, and the plight of these reserves has landed them squarely in the headlines. First came the Health Canada body-bag controversy, then the crushing H1N1 pandemic, then a scathing report on the high rate of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>"I hope this year's events and the current situation will force all levels of government to take action," Grand Chief Harper said.</p>
<p>RCMP Sergeant Line Karpish said the winter roads are markedly worse than usual this year, a veritable "mud bowl."</p>
<p>"Even though the roads are closed, some drivers are still driving on them and leaving it to chance," Sgt. Karpish said. "Some feel the pressure to deliver supplies, and some are willing to push the envelope.... I can't remember ever seeing this many issues, and I don't foresee this being the end of it."</p>
<p>Neither does Grand Chief Harper, who said he fears that climate change will wreak havoc on winter roads in the future.</p>
<p>As it happens, the Centre for Indigenous Environmental Resources, a First Nations organization based in Winnipeg, released a report in 2006 to that effect. "The season has already contracted by at least a week on average, and this trend is predicted to shorten winter access by at least two more weeks in coming decades," the report said. "Climate change issues are developing quickly, there are no obvious solutions."</p>
<p>Since 2001, more than 25% -- or 600 km-- of the winter road system was moved to land, and spending on winter roads has tripled since 1999, according to Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation.</p>
<p>Despite these improvements, the 2006 report urged "serious discussions" among the provincial and federal governments and First Nations communities to address the situation. Grand Chief Harper, meantime, said there is still much to be done.</p>
<p>"This has become a human rights issue -- no one should be cut off like this," he said. "No one should feel this isolated."</p>

<p>The federal government is considering having a backup supplier to make pandemic flu vaccines instead of the one source Canada currently has, and it's asking the industry for input on the idea.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>'s 10-year contract to produce all of the country's pandemic flu vaccine, and most of the seasonal flu vaccine, expires one year from now, and Ottawa is reviewing its options for the next contract.</p>
<p>According to a request for information document from Public Works and Government Services Canada, the department that manages vaccine contracts, the government will offer a new long-term contract with a domestic manufacturer to produce 100 per cent of pandemic vaccine and an "appropriate portion" of the seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
<p>It will also consider a second pandemic supply contract to serve as a backup to the primary supplier, and that contract could possibly include making some of the seasonal vaccine as well, the document says.</p>
<p>Additional companies will also be considered for the seasonal flu vaccine "as necessary."</p>
<p>Doubts about <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>'s exclusive contract were raised by some critics this fall during the H1N1 pandemic when the company's production timeline of the new vaccine hit a snag and there was a shortfall of supply in the early weeks of the immunization campaign.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> had to first finish making the seasonal flu vaccine before it could start making H1N1 vaccine, and it also produced two versions of the pandemic vaccine - one with an adjuvant, or booster agent, and one without - but it has one production line, and that caused a delay in supply.</p>
<p>Federal health officials, however, insisted Canada was better off having one supplier producing massive amounts of vaccine than other countries such as the United States where five or more companies were producing smaller amounts. Canada was able to get its shipments out faster, to more people, than the U.S., they said.</p>
<p>Chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones did acknowledge, though, it would be considered in the future whether there is an "additional advantage" to having a second supplier to help "hedge our bets."</p>

<p>She billed herself as a "one-of-a-kind landlord," and Saanich renters can thank their lucky stars for that. Charmaine Roy bilked dozens of people out of their rent deposits.</p>
<p>Roy was convicted this week of 30 counts of fraud. She was sentenced Wednesday to house arrest for 12 months and three years of probation for the bogus apartment-rental scheme.</p>
<p>Roy, 48, is banned under the terms of the conditional sentence from taking part in any rental or real-estate transactions. She can leave her home only during one four-hour period each week.</p>
<p>While Roy sobbed as she told the court Monday she was sorry for her crimes, Judge Adrian Brooks said Wednesday that her remorse didn't ring true: "It was as phoney as the rental agreements she signed."</p>
<p>Roy and her husband rent a house on Ferndale Road for $2,800 a month and have permission from the owner to sublet a secondary suite. The two-bedroom suite was advertised on the Internet for $875 to $900 a month and attracted many inquiries from University of Victoria students.</p>
<p>The suite was, in fact, occupied by a long-term tenant with no intention of moving out. Still, while the tenant was not home, Roy showed the unit to prospective tenants and had them sign rental agreements in exchange for cash damage deposits of $425 to $475.</p>
<p>Many of these people expressed surprise at the "surprisingly low" rent, prosecutor Barbara Penty said. Roy told them "she knew what it was like to be a poor student and she liked to help people out."</p>
<p>Roy would not accept personal cheques.</p>
<p>A day or two before the would-be tenants were due to take possession, Roy would contact them to say the suite was unavailable, citing a range of excuses: There had been a suicide in the suite, a fire had broken out, her mother had died, or people in the dwelling were suffering from H1N1.</p>

<p>Tell someone you're interested in cactus gardens and they are likely to head for the hills. Prickly, dusty, mean looking, cactus run afoul of our ongoing love affair with the blousy, soft, English country garden style still going strong.</p>
<p>A visit to a well-designed cactus garden can adjust that misinformed attitude as swiftly as a poke from a prickly pear.</p>
<p>Gardeners grow prickly pear because one type, Opuntia humifusa, is native to Essex and Kent counties in Ontario. In local gardens they can look lonely, but surrounded by other twisted and thorny "brothers" they emote a childlike charm.</p>
<p>I recently escaped for four days to the tip of the Baja California Peninsula where I visited Cactimundo, a marvellous botanical garden in San Jose del Cabo.</p>
<p>It's small, modern and delightfully graphic. Plump, round cactus of all types butt up against pencil straight cactus, with the circular and the linear looking like illustrations from a book on penmanship.</p>
<p>The garden is designed like a wheel. Walk slowly along the circular paths and it is possible to drift into a meditative state. A hillside planting of cactus in rigid rows sees the gold-coloured plants marching their way to a rendezvous with the deep blue Mexican sky.</p>
<p>Among the wild, woolly and rusty-coloured cactus, icy blue agaves seem welded in place. Their striking beauty aristocratic next to their fearsome neighbours.</p>
<p>A visit to a botanical garden is a way to get grounded when far from home. I had Cactimundo pretty much to myself until buses arrived with tourists from a Norwegian cruise ship. They brushed by the cactus on the way to the gift shop where frosty margaritas were waiting. Maybe they didn't fall in love with the pink comb cactus or the succulents, but their money is key in supporting the privately funded garden that helps showcase and conserve Mexican desert plants.</p>
<p>Cactimundo's imprint can be seen in the Cabo area, where hotels are using native plants to landscape their properties. The botanical garden has its own nursery where plants suitable for the Baja's dry climate are propagated.</p>
<p>I thought about the parallels to other botanical gardens, and specifically Burlington's Royal Botanical Gardens. It costs just $3 US to get in to Cactimundo, which competes with Jack Nicklaus-designed golf courses, bars, boutique hotels, gourmet restaurants and whale watching.</p>
<p>Swine flu and Mexico's crime problems hammered tourism last year. The cactus were probably pretty lonely. Here you can substitute SARS, and add casinos, concerts, sports, theatre and Toronto as splashy ways to spend money in places other than botanical gardens.</p>
<p>But Cactimundo has a rich, soulful story to discover. Like all good botanical gardens it reveals the history of the land quietly and slowly.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Family time more important than career, CEO says</b>
</div><div>By Lauren Krugel   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>596 words</div><div>17 March 2010</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>F3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>

<p>CALGARY</p>
<p>As Sean Durfy navigated Canada's second-largest airline through a ruthless economic environment, he was simultaneously dealing with turbulent times for his family.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, he explained why his role as husband and father ultimately trumped his role as chief executive officer at <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>.</p>
<p>"In my 15-year career of being an executive, I've never had more than two weeks off. It's about time that I spend more time with my family," Durfy, 43, told a news conference.</p>
<p>"It's amazing that people have a hard time accepting that in this day and age."</p>
<p>WestJet announced without warning late Monday that Durfy would step down and that Gregg Saretsky, vice-president of operations, would take the helm. Durfy is to stay on and help with the transition until September.</p>
<p>His only plans so far are to spend time with his wife, three-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>"I like to call it ‘Freedom-43.' So effectively I'm retired," Durfy said, adding that the idea of returning to the "all-consuming" airline industry holds no appeal.</p>
<p>In an interview, he said he made his decision to step down after his wife, Tracy, recovered from a long illness. She had a brain tumour removed four years ago, and suffered some complications this past year, which only recently cleared up.</p>
<p>"With her health now fully recovered and feeling fantastic, I sat back and we thought about it and said ‘What do we need to do?'" Durfy said, tears welling up in his eyes.</p>
<p>"And what we need to do as a family is spend more time together and that's why I'm doing what I'm doing."</p>
<p>The announcement came as a surprise and raised speculation that he was replaced because of the airline's recent financial performance and operational problems.</p>
<p>Airline industry analyst Rick Erickson said he was "dismayed" by those reports.</p>
<p>"Profits are off in the last quarter. Well guess what? Profits are off with every single airline worldwide, even glorious Southwest (Airlines) is not performing to the same level that WestJet has," he said.</p>
<p>The introduction of WestJet's new reservation system last fall came with a lot of glitches that left customers on the phone for hours and caused long lineups at airports. Those problems have since been fixed.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't point my finger at Durfy for that - not by any means," Erickson said.</p>
<p>He said he takes Durfy's reason for leaving at "face value" and that there was no evidence of a "coup" to push him out.</p>
<p>"It's obviously a personal call that he's made. He's got young children. I gather he feels his resources are much better spent looking after those affairs," Erickson said.</p>
<p>All airlines have suffered over the past year or so as the recession dampened travel plans for many consumers. The H1N1 flu scare also dissuaded travellers from visiting Mexico, where the virus first cropped up a year ago.</p>
<p>Saretsky, Durfy's successor, said he'll guide the airline through growth into more international markets.</p>
<p>WestJet already has plans to roll out code-share deals with <span class="companylink">Air France</span>, KLM and <span class="companylink">Southwest Airlines</span>. Building on that, the airline wants to see traffic from Asia, South America and elsewhere in Europe come to Canada, Saretsky said.</p>

<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>657 words</div><div>17 March 2010</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>The e-mail screams: "Work from home, make thousands, it's easy."</p>
<p>It's also, in all likelihood, a scam.</p>
<p>According to the Competition Bureau of Canada it's the kind of e-mail that is turning up in electronic inboxes with increased frequency, and should be sent to the trash with all speed.</p>
<p>"We have seen a rather alarming rise in the number of complaints we've been getting about this kind of scam," said Commissioner of Competition Melanie Aitken, noting the Internet has proved to be a fertile breeding ground for scam artists and fraudsters.</p>
<p>Aitken points out online fraud complaints have increased 77 per cent since 2005.</p>
<p>"But at the end of the day it's just another vehicle for fraudsters to use," she said. "They are coming up with new and creative ways to cheat people, but often times it's just repackaging in Internet form what they have been doing for decades in other forms."</p>
<p>Indeed fraud remains a strong business in Canada -- the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre's 2009 annual report revealed the total reported loss due to mass-marketing fraud was $59.3 million, a slight increase over 2008, though down from the $66.7 million reported in 2007.</p>
<p>However, there was an increase in the number of complaints in 2009 to 40,356 from 36,524 in 2008 and 38,183 in 2007.</p>
<p>As fraud prevention month rolls along in March, the Competition Bureau and local Better Business Bureaus are trying to draw attention in particular to the Internet-based scams in the hope that shining a light on them will cut down on losses.</p>
<p>"We are trying to create more awareness," said Rosalind Scott, executive director of the Better Business Bureau of Vancouver Island. "Every time you turn around there's a new Internet scam."</p>
<p>The BBB is focusing its attention on "phishing" scams which arrive by email or text and direct recipients to websites where they are to input account information or provide personal details which can threaten a person's financial information.</p>
<p>"And these guys do not discriminate, we're all vulnerable," said Aitken. "They do this irrespective of age, where you come from, where you live or how much money you make. They are pretty clever folks."</p>
<p>The best defence is education, said Aitken.</p>
<p>"But it's also important to share the information so we can compile the complaints and with our partners investigate and try and crack down on these scams," she said, noting in many cases people are embarrassed by having been taken in and are reluctant to come forward. "For as many complaints as we get there's a lot more out there."</p>
<p>To protect consumers, the BBB recommends not responding to unsolicited email, being suspicious of any request to update financial information and reporting "phishing" scams to Phonebusters (the Canadian Anti-Fraud Call Centre at 1-888-495-8501).</p>
<p>Right now, Aitken said the most prevalent online scams are tend to revolve around employment.</p>
<p>"That's no surprise given the economy, they offer high-income, low-effort work from home," she said, noting recipients are asked to send off money to get a "useless package of materials."</p>
<p>The other popular scam involves heath care and promises of cures for everything from cancer and H1N1 to AIDS.</p>
<p>According to Scott, the Island has seen an increase in debit-card skimming, home-repair rip-offs and the return of the grandparent scam.</p>
<p>"I'm hearing with alarming frequency that older people are falling prey to this scam where someone phones pretending to be a granddaughter or grandson and hopes grandma or grandpa says 'hi sweetheart,' " said Scott. "The scam is they then tell their grandparents they have some crisis or are in trouble and they need money."</p>

</p>
<p>Canadian labour productivity posted its biggest gain in 11 years in the fourth quarter as businesses boosted output while working hours stayed unchanged. And a separate report showed manufacturing was stronger than expected in January.</p>
<p>Productivity rose 1.4 per cent, the first increase since the third quarter of 2008 as the H1N1 flu had little impact, Statistics Canada said Tuesday. It's the highest growth rate since the first quarter of 1998.</p>
<p>More evidence of a revived economy came from the factory sector. Manufacturing sales jumped 2.4 per cent in January, the fifth month in a row of gains, Statscan said. Economists has expected a 0.6-per-cent gain.</p>
<p>“This suggests the manufacturing sector is continuing to fire on all cylinders, defying the adverse impact of the strong Canadian dollar and the weak U.S. economy,” said Millan Mulraine, senior Canadian macro strategist at TD Securities.</p>
<p>Canada's poor productivity record, which worsened through the recession, has long been a source of concern to both economists and policy makers because of its potential to hurt the country's standard of living.</p>

</p>
<p>While the recent pickup in productivity is welcome, “the question of sustainability still remains front as centre as firms continue to increase hours worked along with overall employment,” said Bank of Nova Scotia economists Businesses increased their output by 1.4 per cent in the quarter, the highest growth rate since 2002, fuelled by exports, consumer spending and residential investment.</p>
<p>Hours worked in the business sector were unchanged, after rising 0.3 per cent in the third quarter. Employment edged up 0.1 per cent, while hours worked per job fell by 0.1 per cent.</p>
<p>“Both goods-producing and service-producing sectors made positive contributions to the upturn in business productivity in the fourth quarter,” the report said.</p>
<p>Cat:e528746c-3414-401a-b14b-50247e3bdf01Forum:2d13dc33-9921-4d4a-815f-e809277631e4</p>
<p>Productivity of goods-producing firms rose 1.7 per cent following three quarters of declines, with widespread gains. Manufacturers led, with a 2.1-per-cent increase.</p>
<p>Productivity on the services side of the economy rose 1 per cent, a fourth straight quarterly gain. The largest increases were in wholesale trade, retail trade and information and cultural services.</p>
<p>The flu didn't have much of an impact on productivity. The second wave of H1N1, the seasonal flu and the vaccination campaign in November and December resulted in the loss of 27 million hours worked in Canada.</p>
<p>But hours lost due to illness “were not significantly different from hours lost due to illness in previous years.” Since 2000, the portion of hours lost because of illness or child-care obligations in the fourth quarter has ranged from 2.7 per cent in 2001 to 3.2 per cent in 2006.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter of last year, it was 3.1 per cent.</p>
<p>Labour productivity tracks real GDP per hour worked in the private sector. Statscan said it revised its numbers back to the first quarter of 2009.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>The government released an "all-hazards" emergency response plan four months after it was chastised for not having one approved by cabinet.</p>
<p>The plan lists responsibilities departments and agencies have in national or provincial emergencies, as well as international ones that could affect Canada.</p>
<p>"It outlines the processes and mechanisms needed for an integrated response to an emergency," Public Safety Minister Vic Toews said Monday.</p>
<p>"It's also designed to co-ordinate emergency response efforts by federal, provincial and territorial governments, as well as the private sector and NGOs, he said.</p>
<p>"Most of all, it will help to ensure that the government's response to an emergency is seamless and timely and that key decisions can be made quickly when disaster strikes."</p>
<p>Largely logistical in nature, the plan touches on virtually every conceivable natural or man-made disaster, from toxic spills and plane or train crashes to earthquakes, deadly storms and pandemics.</p>
<p>It also addresses government roles in tackling "cyber incidents" and terrorism - all in</p>
<p>the name of protecting lives, property, national security and the economy.</p>
<p>In November, Auditor General Sheila Fraser said Public Safety Canada - the agency responsible for co-ordinating the federal crisis response - had not completed an emergency blueprint, nor had it received formal blessing.</p>
<p>That was two years after Parliament gave the department the lead on crisis management.</p>
<p>Fraser said while there was a crisis-response framework on the books, more work was needed to ensure "an integrated, co-ordinated approach to emergencies."</p>
<p>Canada has endured wide-scale emergencies in recent years including the recent H1N1 flu pandemic, the 2003 SARS outbreak, numerous severe floods and the 1998 ice storm in Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<p>The plan establishes liaison officers to serve as links between their departments and the government in emergencies, while representatives from non-governmental organizations and the private sector may also be called upon for expertise.</p>
<p>"Effective emergency management can only be achieved by sharing resources, targeting priorities, integrated plans and working together with stakeholders across multiple levels of government," said Toews.</p>
<p>"That is what the federal emergency response plan is all about."</p>

</p>
<p><span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. announced a surprise executive shakeup Monday, with changes coming to its top ranks within weeks.</p>
<p>Canada's second-largest carrier said chief executive Sean Durfy announced Monday he will step down effective April 1 and executive vice-president of operations Gregg Saretsky will take over as new CEO.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Calgarybased carrier declined further comment, saying more details would be released today.</p>
<p>In a statement, Durfy, 43, cited personal reasons for his resignation, which will also see him step down from WestJet's board of directors after nearly four years at the helm.</p>
<p>"This was a very difficult decision for me; however, after careful consideration, I have decided that this is best for me and my family," Durfy said.</p>
<p>"Those things I set out to accomplish at WestJet have now been achieved and I believe this is an appropriate time to allow others to carry the torch while I spend more time with my young family."</p>
<p>Durfy, a former <span class="companylink">Enmax</span> executive, joined WestJet in 2004 to head up the airline's marketing, sales and airport operations functions.</p>
<p>In September 2006 he was appointed president and became CEO a year later, taking over the reins from retiring WestJet founder Clive Beddoe.</p>
<p>Durfy will remain with WestJet until Sept. 1, to help with the transition, the airline said.</p>
<p>Saretsky joined the carrier last June, serving as head of WestJet Vacations before moving to operations.</p>
<p>He started his airline career in 1985 with <span class="companylink">Canadian Airlines</span>, and joined Alaska Airlines in 1998, where he worked for 10 years.</p>
<p>"I'm absolutely delighted by this new opportunity," Saretsky said in a statement.</p>
<p>"WestJet has been the envy of the airline industry for a number of years."</p>
<p>Durfy continued a significant expansion of WestJet's network during his tenure, said one analyst who noted there were no signals the airline was planning executive changes.</p>
<p>"If we look at his tenure at WestJet, he proved he could manage growth and he proved he could manage an airline during very, very difficult times," said Rick Erickson, head of Erickson & Associates, a Calgarybased aviation consulting firm.</p>
<p>"Durfy managed the slowdown and he has WestJet on a steady bearing."</p>
<p>Durfy put Caribbean and U.S. sunspot and leisure destinations on the carrier's roster, Erickson said. That shift to seasonal markets likely helped the airline come out of one of the toughest times for the industry, Erickson said.</p>
<p>WestJet was one of only a few North American carriers to turn a profit in the fourth quarter, although the airline's earnings were down more than 60 per cent from the same period a year ago. The airline industry was hit by a drop in passenger traffic last year, as the recession and H1N1 flu scare cut into travel.</p>
<p>WestJet had been struggling with the implementation of its new reservation system, which caused major delays and snarls for bookings in the fall. Earlier this month, it launched its long-delayed loyalty program.</p>

</p>
<p>Canadian labour productivity posted its biggest gain in 11 years in the fourth quarter as businesses boosted output while working hours stayed unchanged.</p>
<p>Productivity rose 1.4 per cent, the first increase since the third quarter of 2008 as the H1N1 flu had little impact, Statistics Canada said Tuesday. It's the highest growth rate since the first quarter of 1998.</p>
<p>Canada's poor productivity record, which worsened through the recession, has long been a source of concern to both economists and policy makers because of its potential to hurt the country's standard of living.</p>
<p>While the recent pickup in productivity is welcome, “sustainability remains the key concern as hours worked begin to ramp up again,” said Bank of Nova Scotia economists before the report was released.</p>
<p>Businesses increased their output by 1.4 per cent in the quarter, the highest growth rate since 2002, fuelled by exports, consumer spending and residential investment.</p>
<p>Hours worked in the business sector were unchanged, after rising 0.3 per cent in the third quarter. Employment edged up 0.1 per cent, while hours worked per job fell by 0.1 per cent.</p>
<p>“Both goods-producing and service-producing sectors made positive contributions to the upturn in business productivity in the fourth quarter,” the report said.</p>
<p>Productivity of goods-producing firms rose 1.7 per cent following three quarters of declines, with widespread gains. Manufacturers led, with a 2.1-per-cent increase.</p>
<p>Productivity on the services side of the economy rose 1 per cent, a fourth straight quarterly gain. The largest increases were in wholesale trade, retail trade and information and cultural services.</p>
<p>The flu didn't have much of an impact on productivity. The second wave of H1N1, the seasonal flu and the vaccination campaign in November and December resulted in the loss of 27 million hours worked in Canada.</p>
<p>But hours lost due to illness “were not significantly different from hours lost due to illness in previous years.” Since 2000, the portion of hours lost because of illness or child-care obligations in the fourth quarter has ranged from 2.7 per cent in 2001 to 3.2 per cent in 2006.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter of last year, it was 3.1 per cent.</p>
<p>Labour productivity tracks real GDP per hour worked in the private sector. Statscan said it revised its numbers back to the first quarter of 2009.</p>

<p>A sobbing Charmaine Roy apologized "from the bottom of my heart" to the people she defrauded in an apartment rental scam as her sentencing hearing continued yesterday in Victoria provincial court.</p>
<p>"I stand before you, not the same person I was 50 days ago. Being in jail has dramatically changed me," the Saanich landlady told Judge Adrian Brooks. "I assure you it will never, ever happen again."</p>
<p>Last week, Roy pleaded guilty to 30 counts of fraud and two counts of breach of recognizance in relation to the rental of an apartment in her home on Ferndale Road.</p>
<p>Between July and December 2009, she collected damage deposits from dozens of prospective tenants, but told them at the last minute the suite couldn't be rented because of a suicide, fire or because she had contracted the H1N1 virus. In total, she defrauded her victims, many of whom were University of Victoria students, of $13,690.</p>
<p>Roy, who has been in custody since Jan. 21, begged Brooks to return her to the community so she can serve as an outstanding member of society and pay restitution to her victims. Roy said she had told her 11-year-old daughter "everything" and had explained to her that sometimes people make mistakes.</p>
<p>Describing herself as a "decent, loving human being," Roy promised Brooks she would strive every day to be the best person she can be.</p>
<p>Brooks will sentence Roy later this week. Crown prosecutor Barbara Penty called the offences a breach of trust and asked for a prison sentence of two to three years.</p>
<p>Defence lawyer Tybring Hemphill is asking for a conditional sentence of less than two years, followed by probation. The court can also direct Roy not to accept cash payments for any purpose, said Hemphill, who noted the 49-year-old has no criminal record.</p>
<p>Roy's crimes were unsophisticated, desperate and easily detectable, he said.</p>
<p>She has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and sought mental-health treatment when she lived on the Lower Mainland, which indicates she has a willingness to seek help and treatment, said Hemphill.</p>
<p>The judge should consider her genuine guilty pleas and comments in her psychological report that indicate Roy has taken responsibility for her actions, said Hemphill. She has also endured a public shaming in the media.</p>
<p>Roy knows her actions have hurt people, and rendered some people with low incomes homeless, said the defence lawyer.</p>
<p>Originally, Roy began defrauding people with the intent to pay them back, and some were paid back, said Hemphill. But the scam spiralled out of control when Roy began taking some very significant sums in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Roy, who was granted $5,000 bail but could not afford it, will remain in custody until Brooks delivers his decision.</p>

<p>Even in distant, landlocked Saskatchewan, we can learn a lot from a Pacific tsunami warning.</p>
<p>It came the other week after the devastating earthquake in Chile. Worse was yet to come, warned the experts. The quake had generated a towering tsunami that now was racing across the Pacific at the speed of a jetliner. In Hawaii, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre issued its highest level of alert, urging "urgent action to protect lives and property."</p>
<p>The warning covered all Hawaiian shores, regardless of which direction they faced.</p>
<p>"Everybody is at risk now," declared a spokesperson for the warning centre.</p>
<p>Coastal areas were evacuated to the howl of civil defence sirens. While the U.S. navy moved ships out of Pearl Harbor, tourists and residents scrambled for high ground. Others jammed gas stations and grocery stores to stock up on emergency supplies. All were galvanized by recollections of the cataclysmic 2004 tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people around the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Only this time, there was no tsunami. When the supposedly devastating wave reached Hawaii, it was imperceptible.</p>
<p>Among authorities who had sounded the false alarms, there is zero contrition.</p>
<p>"It's a key point to remember that we cannot end the warnings," said an oceanographer speaking for the tsunami warning centre. "Failure to warn is not an option for us. We cannot have a situation that we thought was no problem and then it's devastating. That just cannot happen."</p>
<p>In other words, we can't predict tsunamis, but we are going to keep doing so, regardless.</p>
<p>For this, we need experts? Why not train a monkey instead to hit the tsunami alarm whenever there's an earthquake anywhere near an ocean. It would cost only a few bananas and the results would be the same.</p>
<p>The ascendancy of dubious expertise goes beyond tsunamis to doomsday science in general. Experts exaggerate risk all the time and rarely are held to account.</p>
<p>Remember Y2K? This was the digital doomsday that supposedly was to kick off the new millennium. Experts then warned of a worldwide computing crash at the stroke of midnight, Dec. 31, 1999. Global chaos would ensue, we were told. Governments and industries around the world responded by spending an estimated $1 trillion reprogramming their computers to handle the changeover. Still the dire predictions continued. Emergency services spent their New Year's Eve on standby, braced for the worst.</p>
<p>When the cataclysmic moment came, nothing happened. Even computers that had not been reprogrammed ran on without a glitch. Around the world, no one even was inconvenienced.</p>
<p>Experts then claimed things would have been a lot worse had we not spent the $1 trillion, never mind that it mostly was spent on their services. Their explanation would have been easier to take seriously if my then-obsolete desktop computer, utterly unprotected by any Y2K tweaking, had not booted up on Jan. 1, 2000, without missing a byte.</p>
<p>More recently, experts were ringing the alarm bells over the so-called H1N1 pandemic. In spite of their dire predictions, the pandemic turned out to be a blip. The regular seasonal flu that comes around every fall without anyone hoisting the black flag we now know is 10 times more virulent.</p>
<p>Again, there is zero contrition from panicky health authorities who scared Canadians for no good reason and who presided over the waste of $400 million on an emergency vaccination scheme.</p>
<p>But we didn't know then how virulent it was, the authorities now say.</p>
<p>Nonsense. Before any vaccine was ordered for Canada, H1N1 had already been through Mexico, among other places, and revealed itself as a relatively minor malady. By then, however, the wheels were set in motion and apparently could not be stopped. It didn't help that public health authorities, in spite of glaring evidence to the contrary, continued to exaggerate the minuscule risk. Not one among them was willing to step forward and reassure worried Canadians with a more realistic assessment.</p>
<p>As the H1N1 scare recedes, we still have global warming to worry about. But here, too, scary predictions from the experts now are revealed as highly suspect, at best. The leak of e-mails from a British climate research centre has cast into serious doubt the science behind these predictions. Even the leading alarmists now are compelled to admit what already was apparent to anyone who looked at the record, namely that there has been no global warming for the last 15 years. This is exactly the opposite of what was predicted by the computer models that support the whole global warming edifice. The models clearly are worthless, but the edifice somehow remains standing, at least for the moment.</p>
<p>The experts appear to be no more reliable on the subject of obesity, another supposedly deadly threat. What they cannot explain is why, if so many Canadians are so dangerously overweight, our life expectancy just keeps going up and up. I only wish we could live long enough to hear the experts admit for once they were flat-out wrong.</p>

</div><div>DAVID SHOALTS   </div>

<p>For the fifth consecutive year, the Toronto Maple Leafs are grinding out the final weeks of an NHL season that will see them finish out of the playoffs.</p>
<p>But there is a difference this time.</p>
<p>There is a spark of hope for next season even if the Leafs do not escape the bottom five, which would be a bonanza for the Boston Bruins because of that first-round draft pick the Leafs surrendered as part of the Phil Kessel trade. (That, of course, has been a major topic all season for Leaf fans and will remain so up to the June entry draft.)</p>
<p>This is not so much because of Kessel's play but the collective play of Kessel and linemates Tyler Bozak and Nikolai Kulemin.</p>
<p>The Leafs' youthful No. 1 line is finally playing like one after a cold streak that began before the Olympic break. The exact day the line was born is a little murky, since Kessel played with Bozak a little after he was called up for good from the Toronto Marlies on Jan. 12 and a little with Matt Stajan until he was traded to the Calgary Flames on Jan. 31.</p>
<p>By the end of the first week of February, though, they were a trio, with Bozak, 23, in the middle, Kessel, 22, on the right wing and Kulemin, 23, on the left. In the three games leading up to the Olympic break, all the line could manage was a single goal by Bozak.</p>
<p>March has been much kinder.</p>
<p>In the six games going into last night's 4-1 loss against the New York Islanders, the three of them collectively ran up 10 goals and 11 assists. It is no coincidence that before yesterday's setback, the Leafs were 4-1-1 since the March 3 trade deadline.</p>
<p>“We've been creating a lot of opportunities the last couple of weeks and a lot of them haven't been going in for us,” Bozak said. “But I think it's starting to come around now.”</p>
<p>Each player brings something different to the line. Kessel, in his fourth NHL season despite being the youngest, is a sniper with speed and a big shot. Kulemin can handle the puck, but he is the physical presence of the group, using his 6-foot-1, 225-pound frame to fore-check, dig pucks out of corners and crash the net.</p>
<p>Bozak, the eldest on the line by four months over Kulemin, has the least amount of NHL experience at 24 games in his rookie season.</p>
<p>But he is a slick playmaker and shows a skill at faceoffs beyond his years. He went into the Islander game with a 56.5 faceoff win percentage, which ranks among the top 20 in the league for players who have taken 200-plus draws.</p>
<p>“It was a big thing with me growing up, ever since I started playing,” Bozak said. “So at every level, I've been the guy to take the faceoffs.”</p>
<p>The credit for this goes to Bozak's father, Mitch, who was a slick little centre in the late 1970s for the University of Saskatchewan Huskies. When he was raising sons Justin and Tyler in Regina, Mitch started their lessons in faceoffs on the backyard rink at an early age.</p>
<p>“He was big on faceoffs; he knew it's a big thing in the game,” Bozak said. “It was always something he wanted me to work on. He dropped pucks for me and taught me little things because he was a centreman, too.”</p>
<p>With 18 points in 23 games before yesterday, Bozak does not have many complaints about his rookie season. That was not the case in October when he thought he had a good chance to make the team out of training camp but was sent to the Marlies save for one early appearance as a injury fill-in.</p>
<p>It was just as well, though, since Bozak had to deal with illness and injury as well as learn what it takes to play professional hockey. He missed several weeks with what was suspected to be the H1N1 flu, including a week in quarantine.</p>
<p>Then Bozak hurt his ankle and missed more time, which kept him from rounding into form until late December.</p>
<p>“Yeah, at the time you're not happy about it,” Bozak said of his October disappointment. “It's not the spot you want to be because your goal is to be [with the Leafs]. But it was good for experience. I learned a lot about the professional game, like the amount of rest [needed] and the right food you need to eat just to play this hefty schedule.</p>
<p>“It's been quite a roller-coaster ride for me this year. I couldn't be any happier now.”</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- Canadians think the best way to balance the federal books is on the backs of public servants, according to a new national opinion poll.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper appears to be on the right path then, having just delivered a budget that promises wage freezes and $8-billion in cuts to public-sector spending over the next five years. It has also pledged to get rid of the $56-billion deficit in that time.</p>
<p>“The default position for a lot of Canadians is to believe that there is always fat that can be trimmed in the public service,” says Nik Nanos, author of the new Nanos-Policy Options poll. “It shows that [the public service] is the easiest target. … [Canadians are saying] we would like others to shoulder the burden for managing the deficit as opposed to taking it on individually.”</p>
<p>The poll asked which strategy Canadians felt was most effective to help balance the budget. Thirty-six per cent of the respondents felt that freezing government wages was the best approach compared to 3.4 per cent who felt that increasing personal taxes was the way to go. In addition, 20.5 per cent said that government and program spending should be cut, compared to 7.9 per cent who believe the GST should be increased.</p>
<p>The poll of 1,000 Canadians was conducted between March 6 and March 12. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 per cent, 19 times out of 20.</p>
<p>“Here we are again,” says John Gordon, the president of the Public Service Alliance of Canada that represents 165,000 workers.</p>
<p>“Every time the government gets into [trouble] they kind of ramp up the rhetoric and the Canadian public starts to believe them …” he said.</p>
<p>In general terms, he added, his members' wages run behind those in comparable positions in the private sector.</p>
<p>His workers are an easy target, he said, because the government fails to explain what it means to get rid of public servants – that services provided to the public would be affected.</p>
<p>For example, Mr. Gordon points to the work done by federal public servants during the H1N1 crisis to get vaccines in place and deal with the pandemic.</p>
<p>“It's easy to broad brush it and say they should be freezing wages, which they have already done and cutting public services, which they are already doing. …” he said, but added that the public has to ask itself what services it would like to see gone.</p>
<p>“I bet you'll get a different picture,” he says.</p>
<p>The poll also asked what Canadians thought of the government's handling of its economic policies. It found that 35 per cent of respondents felt the government was doing a good or very good job, compared to 30 per cent who felt it was doing a bad or very bad job. The same number said the government was doing neither a good nor a bad job.</p>
<p>And 30.7 per cent of Canadians said that the government's deficit was acceptable.</p>
<p>Mr. Nanos says this budget is a no-risk document for the Harper government and one aimed at government survival.</p>
<p>“It was not too ambitious for the opposition parties to criticize … not really much to punch at, so it makes it easier to survive,” said Mr. Nanos.</p>
<p>He also believes this budget will mean an election either this spring or fall.</p>
<p>“[This year's budget] puts the government in a position where it can potentially fight an election before the tough medicine has to be doled out,” he said.</p>

</p>
<p>What follows is the personal story of a 95-year-old lifelong Albertan, the daughter of hard-working immigrants who desperately needs long-term care. She is a relative of mine, but I've chosen not to name her for privacy reasons. Suffice to say that her case is not much different than the estimated 1,700 other Albertans waiting for a long-term care bed in this province.</p>
<p>We'll call her Rosie. She was doing quite well until eight months ago, when she suffered two heart attacks. Today, she's hooked up to oxygen full time, taking a dozen different medications and has mild dementia. She lives with her family, who can no longer properly care for her.</p>
<p>Rosie occasionally imagines that other people are living with her or coming to visit. She recently claimed that an old friend dropped by in the middle of the night, accompanied by a half-dozen others. She said they stood around her bed silently, without talking. Rosie offered to make a pot of coffee. "No thanks," one of the visitors said. "We have to go."</p>
<p>Rosie related the incident to me not long ago.</p>
<p>"It scared me," she said, near tears. I told her it was probably a dream, but to Rosie it was very real. It was the first time she had expressed fear over one of her imagined visitors.</p>
<p>After Rosie was assessed for long-term care and deemed eligible for placement, her family filled out forms listing three preferences for Calgary-and-area long-term care facilities, which they had researched and visited.</p>
<p>This is the standard procedure that Albertans follow for placement in a facility with government-approved rates of $54.25 daily for a private room ($1,627 per month) and $47 for a semiprivate room ($1,410 per month). Fees at privately run care centres vary by need and can approach $4,000 a month for full care.</p>
<p>Moving to a care facility is traumatic for seniors. It's bad enough that they must leave familiar surroundings with only the few cherished possessions they can fit into their new single room, but they often must do so on a scant 48-hours notice due to the demand for space.</p>
<p>The quick turnaround "is one of the most difficult things that families must face" when a bed becomes available, says Denise Mac-Donald of the Alberta Continuing Care Association, which represents facility operators.</p>
<p>Although the wait for a room can be months, the call for Rosie came only a week after her application had been submitted. We eagerly raced to the facility -- one of the nicest in Calgary -- to do the paperwork, only to be chagrined at Rosie's accommodation. Rather than the beautiful rooms we had toured, we were told that Rosie must first go into a "transition room" -- a small, single room with one closet that had been crammed with two beds and a divider curtain for privacy, with no sitting area. A small wardrobe had been put against a wall for Rosie's use.</p>
<p>The room was clearly never designed for two people.</p>
<p>Rosie, although frail and with marginal dementia, could still smell a bad deal. Faced with being put in a transition room for an indeterminate period until a bigger room opened, she refused to go. The family struck the facility off its list. We now wait for another care centre to call.</p>
<p>According to Alberta Health Services, the room is a remnant from last year's H1N1 crisis when care facilities were asked to create more space to free hospital beds occupied by seniors. Although the crisis has abated, this particular facility has opted to keep the room as is.</p>
<p>The Continuing Care Association says transition rooms are not widespread. Are facility operators trying to squeeze more money out of the system? The association will only say that accommodation fees have historically not kept up with the pace of inflation and that operators are forced to find efficiencies.</p>
<p>According to Ruth Adria of the Elder Advocates of Alberta Society, the situation will only get worse with an aging population. She described one transition room at an Edmonton care facility as "a hovel."</p>
<p>Rosie's room was nowhere near that bad. The facility was gorgeous and the staff seemed dedicated. Still, Adria says cramped transition rooms should not be acceptable in such a bountiful province.</p>
<p>"She's at the mercy of a very callous system," she said of Rosie and the hundreds just like her.</p>
<p>Leaked government documents obtained last year by the NDP indicates that the provincial government was considering moving more seniors into assisted living rather than long-term care, due to demand. Critics fear that will diminish care for those needing long-term assistance. Mary Anne Jablonski, the Alberta minister responsible for seniors, said no decisions had been made.</p>
<p>Without subsidies for more seniors' facilities, the documents also show that private investors would need to nearly double accommodation fees to build and run new long-term-care facilities.</p>
<p>Rosie doesn't have that kind of money. It is not the Alberta that she had imagined in her dying years.</p>

<p>Michael Ignatieff and his Liberals didn't want to take on the Harper government over their budget – the budget passed “in principle” through the House this week and the government is still standing. The last thing the Liberals want right now is an election.</p>
<p>So what to do in the meantime?</p>
<p>Well, on Monday the Liberals are going to use their opposition day to debate the use of the controversial taxpayer-funded pamphlets called “10 per centers.” The Liberals discussed the pros and cons of these publicly funded pamphlets, which in many cases are partisan attack ads, in their caucus this week.</p>
<p>The program allows MPs to send out leaflets into no more than 10 per cent of households of other ridings. The Tories take full advantage of the program, sending many partisan sheets out into Liberal ridings. They also use them, say Liberals, to gather names and addresses of potential voters – adding to their database. All of this is at public expense.</p>
<p>This was the point the Liberal leader made to his caucus, saying the pamphlets should be stopped because they are not only a waste of taxpayers' money but also a Tory tool to expand its lists of potential voters.</p>
<p>In January, according to the Liberals, the Tories put out just “shy” of 10 million pieces of mail.</p>
<p>“We would have done 1.7 million,” says a senior Liberal official. “Our guys hate them, the leader hates them. I think Canadians hate them.”</p>
<p>Last fall, the 10-per-center issue became particularly contentious after the Conservatives sent out partisan pamphlets attacking the Liberals to Jewish voters in Liberal-held ridings, saying the Tories have fought anti-Semitism abroad and supported Israel, but the Liberals have not.</p>
<p>Completely stopping the use of these pamphlets poses a dilemma for the Liberals, however.</p>
<p>“The tough part is do you vacate the small piece of field we occupy and give the whole thing to the Tories?” asks the official.</p>
<p>Interesting, too, is that this week the Canadian Taxpayers Federation awarded its annual “Teddy” award for government waste to “MP junk mail.”</p>
<p>The federation noted that the flyers have increased in cost from $5.9-million in 2005-06 to $10-million in 2008-09.</p>
<p>Mauril Belanger, the veteran Liberal MP from Ottawa-Vanier, is one politician who has long been opposed to these publicly funded pamphlets.</p>
<p>On Nov. 18, 2008 – when the House had returned just after the general election – Mr. Belanger campaigned to be House Speaker and in his pitch he talked about the poor behaviour among politicians.</p>
<p>“There is another way in which this lack of civility, and sometimes animosity, manifests itself outside the House, which needs to be addressed,” Mr. Belanger said. “What has happened over the last few years is that we have taken to sending these 10 per centers to other members' ridings and they have quite often turned into methods of an attack of sitting MPs, always at the public expense.”</p>
<p>Over the years, however, he says he has seen the “incredible” growth of these pamphlets. “I hope that at some point goodwill will prevail and we will stop this practice,” he said.</p>
<p>The Conservatives defend the practice. Tory party spokesman Fred DeLorey says part of being a good MP is to communicate with Canadians from across Canada. He's also done his homework when it comes to accusations his party uses the pamphlets to attack its opposition.</p>
<p>Mr. DeLorey has put together a package of 10 per centers from opposition MPs, some of which are very negative pieces, including the Liberals' “No vaccines, just body bags” pamphlet that was sent out during the H1N1 crisis.</p>
<p>The Liberals were forced to apologize for playing politics with the flu crisis in aboriginal communities.</p>
<p>“It's a little rich for the Liberals to be making accusations of incivility,” Mr. DeLorey says. “All three opposition parties send out very negative material on Conservatives, and the Liberals are the worst offenders.”</p>

<p>The plight of our First Nation youth has once again caused a major media stir with the violent death of Eric Daniels who was shot by police this past weekend.</p>
<p>Gordon Sinclair pointed out in his column on March 9, the anniversary of J.J. Harper's death, "If people want to rise, leaders must help lift."</p>
<p>As leaders, we do what we can do.</p>
<p>Former national chief Phil Fontaine's work led to the official apology by Canada to residential school survivors. Understanding the intergenerational effects of residential school -- broken families, cultural identity crises and the subsequent cycle of violence and addiction -- is one of the most important steps to giving our people the "lift" they need.</p>
<p>Our own Assemby of Manitoba Chiefs Youth has adapted a youth suicide prevention program specifically for our First Nation communities, a program that is one of its kind in the world and will be highlighted in an international academic book published out of Sweden.</p>
<p>Mayor Sam Katz, who has been a consistent supporter of aboriginal programs and services, worked with AMC to create the Eagle's Nest program, which provides a three-month support course for aboriginal youth who are out of school or out of work. The program features cultural teachings, job training, nutrition, exercise -- an overall holistic approach to learning that so far has graduated many of our youth. After three intakes, more than 90 per cent of participants have returned to school or work.</p>
<p>I have worked closely with former justice minister Dave Chomiak to revise the Police Act to end police investigating police -- this was recommended in the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry that came out of J.J. Harper's death. I have seen Health Minister Theresa Oswald commit provincial money to the health of our people during the H1N1 crisis, money that fell under the jurisdiction of the federal government, but Oswald put lives above jurisdictional wrangling.</p>
<p>The federal government has been underfunding our First Nation CFS services by 22 per cent and has now begun to work with the provinces for funding equity. I must commend provincial Family Services Minister Gord Mackintosh for working with us to ensure that this federal funding, promised in the 2010 budget, reaches the people who need it most.</p>
<p>Federal Conservative MP Joy Smith has been working with us to raise awareness of human trafficking that affects First Nations women more than any others in Canada and is a growing "business." Smith is also fighting in Ottawa to have extended sentencing for traffickers.</p>
<p>As leaders, we do what we can, but as leaders, we reflect the values of our society.</p>
<p>Canada has one of the highest rates of child poverty among the world's developed countries. One in six of our children live in poverty, and that number rises to one in four in First Nations. That says something about how we as a society value our children.</p>
<p>As First Nations leaders, we know poverty is the number one killer of children. We know that low education rates due to hunger lead to lower graduation rates. We know that the attraction of gangs and prostitution may be the only way an uneducated youth can earn a substantial income. It is a vicious cycle that is perpetuated from generation to generation.</p>
<p>In his article, Sinclair said that leadership does not care. I can say with certainty that many leaders do care and their actions have demonstrated this. But there is only so much that leadership can do.</p>
<p>It takes all of us, leaders, community groups and citizens alike to break the cycle. It takes a village to raise a child.</p>
<p>Ron Evans is grand chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs.</p>

<p>Charmaine Roy of Saanich pleaded guilty yesterday to 30 counts of fraud and two counts of breach of recognizance in relation to the rental of an apartment in her home on Ferndale Road.</p>
<p>She advertised a suite on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> and collected damage deposits from dozens of would-be tenants -- many of them University of Victoria students -- only to come up with excuses at the last minute on why the suite couldn't be rented.</p>
<p>Roy, 48, will have to wait until Monday to find out if Judge Adrian Brooks will accept prosecutor Barb Penty's recommended sentence of two to three years in prison.</p>
<p>It is expected that Roy will also be ordered to repay the prospective tenants $13,630.90 worth of damage deposits.</p>
<p>Roy told the apartment-hunters the suite had been the scene of a suicide or that a fire had occurred there. Roy told one student there had been a fire, her mother had died, she got the H1N1 flu virus and was on disability and waiting for a cheque to arrive. None of these things was true.</p>
<p>Roy assured all the applicants they would get their damage deposits back. Only one did.</p>
<p>A Saanich police officer visited the suite in question on Dec. 30, 2009 and was told by the male tenant that he had no plans to move.</p>
<p>Roy has been held in custody since her last appearance in court on Jan. 22, unable to raise $5,000 bail.</p>

</div><div>By Nick Martin   </div>

<p>MANDATORY phys ed, drug and alcohol counselling, fire code inspections -- all great provincial ideas, say school trustees -- now where's the money to pay for them?</p>
<p>Especially when Education Minister Nancy Allan keeps telling school boards to control spending and freeze school property taxes.</p>
<p>"When there's certain requests by the government to go their way, we'd like to see a cheque with it to cover the costs," says Hugh Coburn, president of the Manitoba School Boards Association.</p>
<p>MSBA delegates holding their annual convention next Thursday to Saturday want to know how they're supposed to implement all these nifty ideas, but control spending and freeze school property taxes.</p>
<p>Want examples?</p>
<p>The province introduced pilot projects in 1993 in which Addictions Foundation of Manitoba has delivered school programs on alcohol, drugs and gambling. The MSBA says schools originally paid 15 per cent of the cost, later 30 per cent, and next fall 46 per cent; if schools start the programs for the first time, they're on the hook for 100 per cent.</p>
<p>Annual school fire inspections run $1,000 apiece, says the MSBA. Required workplace health and safety upgrades are costing just Pembina Trails School Division alone $300,000, points out one resolution.</p>
<p>MSBA estimates that school divisions' costs for mandatory grades 11 and 12 phys ed credits are seven times what the province covers.</p>
<p>Coburn said that no one has costed out just how much more money the province would need to pay, to cover school divisions' shares of all the programs -- but it would be substantial.</p>
<p>But wait, there's more.</p>
<p>Trustees want the province to spell out exactly how far divisions are allowed to go to fund-raise privately for capital campaigns to finance equipment and facilities such as vocational training and computer systems.</p>
<p>They're asking for mandatory kindergarten -- right now, it's the parents' option to start kids before compulsory Grade 1 -- and for wider availability of a pre-kindergarten school year.</p>
<p>Trustees want the province to lift the moratorium on school closings, to establish new guidelines for allowing school boards to decide when to close schools, and to let school divisions decide how many schools they want to maintain and the grades offered within each.</p>
<p>"We'd like to see it lifted, to give us some of our authority back," said Coburn.</p>
<p>There were 13 schools slated for possible closing June 30, 2009, and other small and dwindling-enrolment schools being examined to go on the possible closing list, before the province imposed a moratorium almost two years ago.</p>
<p>After the New Brunswick basketball tragedy in which seven students and an adult died in a highway accident, the province recommended strongly that schools not use 15-seater vans -- divisions want a clear yes-or-no policy, and they want money if they're forced to use larger buses for extra-curricular activities.</p>
<p>nick.martin@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Up for debate</p>
<p>The trustees' convention to be held March 18 to 20 will consider numerous resolutions calling on the province to pick up the tab for an extensive list of education costs, including:</p>
<p>Training of educational assistants (also known as teachers' or classroom aides);</p>
<p>Equipment and staff costs for pandemic planning, including provision of hand sanitizers and substitutes for teachers absent with H1N1;</p>
<p>Full funding through Manitoba Health and the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission for Addictions Foundation of Manitoba programs recently piloted in schools;</p>
<p>Funding for improvements to school grounds to meet the provincial requirements for healthy living and physical education;</p>
<p>Full funding for mandatory school inspections under the fire and building codes and workplace health and safety;</p>
<p>Any new provincial directives should come with full funding, such as mandatory grades 11 and 12 physical education credits;</p>
<p>The province should fund the costs of extracurricular travel such as rural schools' sports programs</p>

<p>Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc is boasting that only 20 per cent of patients have to wait more than the "norm" of either three or six months for surgery. This is not something to brag about.</p>
<p>Bolduc's "confidence" in the health system will be little consolation to the family and friends of Jean-Guy Pitre of Vénise en Québec, who waited more than six months for his heart operation - and died still waiting. Nor will it soothe the other victims, named in recent news stories, of the failures of our health system. Nor all those unnamed who have had comparable problems. Nor anyone, really, because we are each likely to be on a list or a gurney someday.</p>
<p>The recent grim examples have generated the usual finger-pointing in the National Assembly, but the real problem transcends the party divide.</p>
<p>Bolduc says it's not fair to judge the system by an exceptional case. Fair enough. But when 24 per cent of heart patients wait longer than the so-called normal delay, what's normal? Who said six months was acceptable, anyway?</p>
<p>Bolduc is having a bad week, but in fairness no one minister, premier, or party is to blame. Parti Québécois health critic Bernard Drainville, quivering with indignation, says Bolduc and Premier Jean Charest are "personally responsible" for each case. But it was a PQ government - with Pauline Marois as health minister - that shortsightedly launched an early-retirement scheme for MDs and nurses.</p>
<p>Reflexive partisan pugilism can no longer camouflage an issue neither side knows how to handle: the relentless growth of health-care costs. Already, health soaks up about 45 per cent of spending on programs, up from 30 per cent 30 years ago. Each year that share grows, squeezing out other priorities. And each year all the players in the system - except the patients, who have neither a union nor an advertising agency - keep demanding a bigger share of the too-small pie for themselves.</p>
<p>In this regard we admire the limpid logic of Dr. Gaëtan Barrette, who leads the professional association for Quebec's medical specialists: All these problems, he says, are manageable with more money. Look, he reminds us, at how well our emergency rooms and special inoculation clinics ran during the height of last fall's swine-flu scare. Why? Because the government, sensing a crisis, found the money to provide the resources to make service available.</p>
<p>So, the specialists argue in a striking TV advertising campaign in both French and English, let's just get some more money. They've even got respectable proposals: a tax on candy and other junk food, a tax on single-use plastic water bottles, and other proposals.</p>
<p>We're not sure about those taxes. But even with them, we believe the taxpayers' ability to pay will end before the health-care-cost beast is fully fed. The problem is growing critical.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Wildrose stability biggest Tory threat</b>
</div><div>Don Braid   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>

</p>
<p>Alberta's conservative movement is now uneasily divided into two factions, Tory and Wildrose, that have settled into a pattern of roughly equal support.</p>
<p>This is Ted Morton's worst nightmare -- the dreaded family fissure that could destroy the Alberta Conservatives just as it did their federal cousins after the rise of Preston Manning's Reform party.</p>
<p>Barely six months ago the Wildrose Alliance was a fad. Now it's a fact. Wildrose support has levelled off at a remarkably high level. The party's staying power should worry the Tories far more than its sudden rise.</p>
<p>The Tories now stand at 34 per cent. Wildrose is close behind at 30 per cent, with the Liberals lurking back at 23, according to a new Environics poll.</p>
<p>The Tories will say this is temporary. A rising economy will rescue them. Today's release of new energy policies will be the start.</p>
<p>But there's mounting evidence that this theory, although comforting to Tories, could be wrong.</p>
<p>Three polls over four months have shown strong Wildrose support. Unlike other upstart challengers to the Tories over the years -- Western Canada Concept in 1981, for instance -- the new party keeps climbing the cliff instead of falling off.</p>
<p>The previous Environics poll, released almost exactly four months ago, showed the Tories with the same support, 34 per cent, and Wildrose with slightly less at 28. The Liberals had 20 per cent.</p>
<p>Those numbers changed abruptly a month later when an Angus Reid Public Opinion survey showed Wildrose at 39 per cent and the Tories with only 25.</p>
<p>That Wildrose surge in December could have been caused by the Tories' early bungling of the H1N1 flu vaccine campaign. The support levels appeared right for the moment, but they weren't likely to be permanent.</p>
<p>The latest trend seems more realistic and lasting. These could be long-haul numbers, reflecting a period of rough equality between the two conservative parties.</p>
<p>According to the traditional Tory script, it shouldn't be that way.</p>
<p>The party's crisis has eased as the economy improves. They've done an about-face on health care that seems to please many Albertans, and survived an ugly budget without disaster.</p>
<p>Wildrose, meanwhile, draws less publicity because it's no longer fresh news. Leader Danielle Smith is conspicuously absent from the legislature. After winning two crossovers from the Tories, Wildrose has lured no more defectors.</p>
<p>Despite its remarkable rise, the party isn't much more than a bunch of eager rookies whose only deep experience comes from the Tories themselves.</p>
<p>But there it is. At 30 per cent.</p>
<p>There hasn't been anything like this since Peter Lougheed began to sneak up on Social Credit in the late 1960s. Exactly like Lougheed's brand-new Tories, Smith's party is quite popular in the big cities -- ahead in Calgary, gaining in Edmonton.</p>
<p>The Alberta myth, of course, requires that a new conservative party rise up every 40 years or so to crush the old one. Thus the Liberals can never win.</p>
<p>That's Alberta's rough political history. And as George Santayana almost said, if we don't remember history we will repeat it.</p>
<p>But this is merely a brilliant aphorism, not a law. These two groups could just as easily be at war for a decade, exactly like federal Tories and Reformers, driving each other down to defeat.</p>
<p>Liberal government anyone?</p>

</div><div>Tom Blackwell   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>764 words</div><div>11 March 2010</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>A new Canadian-led study has added to a simmering scientific dispute over flu-shot campaigns, concluding that immunizing nursing-home workers does nothing to cut the number of confirmed influenza cases among the homes' elderly residents.</p>
<p>Coming at the end of the largest flu-vaccination campaign in Canadian history, the review of previous studies calls for stepped-up research into alternative, lower-tech ways to combat the virus, such as improved hand washing.</p>
<p>"What troubled us is that [shots] had no effect on laboratory-confirmed influenza," said Dr. Roger Thomas of the University of Calgary, lead author of the paper published by the respected Cochrane Library.</p>
<p>"What we were looking for is proof that influenza ... is decreased. Didn't find it. We looked for proof that pneumonia is reduced. Didn't find it. We looked for proof deaths from pneumonia are reduced. Didn't find it."</p>
<p>A prominent flu expert, however, calls the authors' conclusions misleading, noting that vaccinating workers does, in fact, lessen the amount of influenza-like sickness and the number of deaths from all causes among those nursing-home denizens. That is all that really matters, said Dr. Allison McGeer, infectious disease specialist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>"There is [very little] that you or I can do that is more effective at preventing deaths than vaccinating health-care workers in long-term care facilities," she said. "That's the bottom line .... There is no question."</p>
<p>The studies could not accurately gauge the effect of vaccination on actual laboratory-confirmed flu cases in nursing homes, because so few residents are tested, added Dr. McGeer. If labs had examined specimens from everyone in the studies, the results would likely have shown a reduction in confirmed flu cases, too, she said.</p>
<p>The new paper's co-author is Dr. Tom Jefferson, a British epidemiologist who heads vaccine research for the respected Cochrane Collaboration -- and who has earned a reputation as a scientific dissident for his outspoken criticism of flu vaccination.</p>
<p>In media interviews last year, Dr. Jefferson was quoted as saying he "can't see any reason" for vaccinating anyone against flu -- arguing the shots did nothing to save lives -- and that most influenza-vaccine studies are "rubbish."</p>
<p>Dr. McGeer said she finds it "mind boggling" that medical journals that publish Dr. Jefferson's work do not question his provocative analyses.</p>
<p>"Scientists are passionate about what they do. All of us have belief systems and sometimes, as with any human endeavour, your belief system overwhelms the scientific evidence," she said. "The purpose of scientific method, the purpose of publication is to get back the objectivity ... And we are not doing that effectively with Dr. Jefferson."</p>
<p>The stakes in the debate are high. Governments spent more than $400-million on acquiring H1N1 pandemic vaccine for Canadians. The Ontario government alone spends about $23-million annually in providing seasonal-flu shots free to anyone who wants them.</p>
<p>Public health and hospital officials have also lobbied hard to increase the percentage of health-care workers who get vaccinated, with a handful of Canadian facilities making the practice mandatory for their staff.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada, which oversaw the pandemic flu battle, will study the Cochrane review's findings carefully, said Nadia Mostafa, an agency spokeswoman. The agency recognizes that "it is not effective to only immunize and not take any other infection-prevention measures," she noted.</p>
<p>The review by Dr. Thomas and Dr. Jefferson analyzed five studies on the issue conducted between 1997 and 2009 -- four of them randomized, controlled trials -- using guidelines set out by Cochrane, which does systematic reviews of the effects of drugs and other health measures.</p>
<p>They concluded that vaccinating staff had no proven impact on the amount of laboratory-confirmed flu cases among elderly residents, the number of related pneumonia cases or pneumonia-linked deaths, which the authors said would be the most direct outcomes of flu-shot campaigns.</p>
<p>Dr. Thomas underlined his study's call for high-quality research into other anti-flu measures, such as enhanced use of hand washing, face masks, early detection of the virus with nose swabs and quarantining nursing-homes.</p>
<p>He said he aggressively encouraged such strategies during a previous role as director of long-term care homes in Ottawa, and the facilities' death rates were among the lowest in the city.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccinate kids first to halt flu spread; They're main vectors of transmission, study concludes</b>
</div><div>SHARON KIRKEY   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>520 words</div><div>10 March 2010</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>It comes too late for H1N1, but not for the next flu outbreak: new Canadian research shows vaccinating healthy children and teens first halts the spread of influenza.</p>
<p>The study, which involved dozens of Hutterite colonies in Western Canada, found that immunizing children age 3 to 15 with flu shots formulated for the 2008-09 flu season reduced the incidence of flu by about 60 per cent among people who were not vaccinated.</p>
<p>The data suggests such substantial "herd immunity" in an entire community can be achieved if about 80 per cent of schoolchildren are immunized during a flu outbreak.</p>
<p>The study appears in this week's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p>Children are one of the main vectors of transmission, because they gather in groups.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of evidence that children are the ones that initially will spread influenza in the community," said McMaster University infectious disease expert Dr. Mark Loeb, who led the study.</p>
<p>But healthy kids traditionally have been near the bottom of vaccine priority lists, with first preference going instead to those at high-risk of flu-related complications, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. During the fall wave of pandemic H1N1, healthy children over five were among the last to be immunized.</p>
<p>"This study would suggest these types of policies need to be rethought," Loeb said.</p>
<p>The research involved residents of 49 Hutterite colonies from Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, tight-knit religious communities where about 60 to 120 people reside in each colony. A total of 947 children participated in the trial. In half the colonies, children received the seasonal flu shot; in the other half, children received hepatitis A vaccine. Loeb says hepatitis A shots were an ideal "control," because hepatitis A is known to cause outbreaks in Hutterite communities.</p>
<p>Of those children vaccinated, 502 were in the influenza group, and 445 were in the hepatitis A group. The researchers and research nurses were completely "blinded," as were the Hutterites, as to which colony got which vaccine. The study also recruited 2,326 community members who weren't immunized in order to measure the indirect effect of just vaccinating children.</p>
<p>Participants were followed from December 2008 to June 2009. Nurses went to each colony twice a week, doing swabs to detect flu if someone had symptoms. Blood samples were also drawn to check for antibodies that would suggest a flu infection.</p>
<p>The researchers found that the flu vaccine was 61 per cent effective in indirectly preventing illness in unvaccinated people if they lived in a colony where about 80 per cent of children received the flu shot.</p>
<p>"Overall, if you actually include the children as well, the overall benefit was 60 per cent," Loeb said.</p>
<p>"That's a substantial amount of protection. If you look at the people who would be at high risk, the level of protection in them was almost the same as if they had gotten a vaccine directly themselves."</p>

<p>I'm not so sure I like my friends anymore. I used to like them - honest. We'd have lunch, talk on the phone or exchange e-mails, and they all seemed normal enough. But then came <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, and I was introduced to a sad fact: Many of my friends have dark sides that they had kept from me. Sure, there were times these dark sides would surface - after too many drinks, say - but apologies and denials would follow, and all seemed healthy ... or at least acceptable.</p>
<p>Today my friends trumpet the more unpleasant aspects of their personalities via <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> status updates. No longer hidden or disavowed, they're thrown in my face like infomercials on late-night TV - unavoidable and endless advertisements for the worst aspects of their personalities.</p>
<p>Take Fred. If you were to have lunch with him, you'd find him warm, down-to-Earth, and self-effacing. Read his status updates and you realize he's an insufferable, food-obsessed bore. He'd pause on his way to save a drowning man to sip a cup of volcanic coffee - and then write about it. (Fred's not his real name, of course. None of these names are real. It's bad enough I dislike my friends. I don't want them to dislike me, too.)</p>
<p>Take Andy. You won't find a smarter CEO anywhere, but in tough economic times, he's a CEO without a company to run. So he plays Mafia Wars on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. He's doing well - level 731, whatever that means. And thanks to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and his status updates, I know he's playing about 18 hours a day. Andy, you've run four companies - and this is how you spend your downtime? What happened to golf? What happened to getting another job?</p>
<p>And then there's Arty. He's smart, he's funny, he's competent. On <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, however, he's a teenager, constantly threatening to drive drunk or blow stuff up with fireworks. He also suffers from self-induced stomach ailments. He posts pictures of a huge and dangerous meal, predicts the worst and then documents the fallout in a follow-up post. The initials TMI were invented for Arty's gastric-distress updates.</p>
<p>Liz is positive the H1N1 vaccine will kill us all and that we should avoid it. Chris likes to post at least 20 times a day on every site he can find, so I get to read his thoughts twice, once on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and once on Twitter. Ed can't go to bed at night without letting us all know what he's accomplished that day - which is usually the same thing he accomplished the day before and will accomplish the next day.</p>
<p>In real life, I don't see these sides of people. Face to face, my friends edit themselves, showing me their best. They're nice, smart people, and there's a give-and-take to normal conversations. They don't talk incessantly about their work. They don't point fingers with Glenn Beck bluster or sound like crazy callers on talk radio. But face to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, my friends are like a blind date gone horribly wrong, one in which you sit there listening while the person on the other side of the table blathers on, pretty much forgetting you exist and not always making the best impression.</p>
<p>And yet I'm hooked on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. I sign on several times a day. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> is like hearing your neighbours bicker through a thin apartment wall or watching characters on reality TV self-destruct. The voyeuristic appeal is addictive. I don't want to know the dumb side of my friends, just as I don't really care about Jon and Kate Gosselin's marital problems. But I can't get any of it out of my life.</p>
<p>Sometimes, my friends aren't stupid, they're just boring, keeping all of us abreast of the minutiae of their day. "I'm tired," they'll write. That's it. That's the whole update. (Hmm, maybe more sleep and less Mafia Wars, I think, but I keep my hands off the keyboard.) And they egg each other on. "I have a headache," someone will write. "Why don't you take some Motrin?" suggests a commenter. (Sounds like a good idea to me; maybe I should second it.) Interior thoughts become exterior on a regular basis. "Today I'm glad to be alive," someone will post, even though they rarely talk like that. Then others chime in: "Me, too." Often, all is well in the land of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. Mundane but well.</p>
<p>I've yet to post a status update myself, or comment on anyone else's. Is there any reason to think I'd come off as any smarter? Any less self-absorbed? Any less boring? It's not so much that I censor myself when I talk to my friends, but I generally make a conscious effort not to alienate them.</p>
<p>Still, I'm left with a dilemma. Who is my real friend? Is it the Liz I have lunch with ... or the anti-vaccine lunatic on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>? Is it the guy who understands business better than anyone I know ... or the case of arrested development who repelled the Yakuza in Mafia Wars? Is it the Fred I can grab a sandwich with ... or the Fred who weeps if he's at a party and the wine isn't up to his standards?</p>
<p>I know too much about them. And what do they think of me? The guy who lurks online, afraid to reveal the simplest fact about himself while judging others and making fun of their comments? I probably don't seem like much of a prize either.</p>

</p>
<p>There are a lot of easy criticisms one can throw at Canadian health authorities and the World Health Organization for their H1N1 pandemic work. Who doesn't remember the long lines, the vaccine shortages, the hype?</p>
<p>But in retrospect, there's very little they could have done differently. If another flu pandemic were to pop up tomorrow -- a new type of virus springing from an unknown source at the wrong time of year and spreading like mad -- responsible health authorities would, and should, take most of the same actions all over again.</p>
<p>There's just no other way that makes sense. Not that it's easy to recognize this, especially if you were among those who, in the early days, got turned away from the vaccination clinic after waiting for hours, or if to this day you are still trying to figure out what "adjuvanted" means.</p>
<p>The H1N1 outbreak was a difficult challenge to manage because it was a virus with two faces. It began in Mexico in the spring, the season when flu in the Northern hemisphere should be fading away. And in its early weeks in Mexico, H1N1 killed a large proportion of those it infected.</p>
<p>That death rate did not continue. H1N1 did kill about 16,200 people worldwide, but that's far fewer than the deaths caused by seasonal flu in a year. In Canada, "normal" flu generally kills several thousand a year. H1N1 has killed only 426 people in this country, whereas Canada's official flu pandemic plan says a severe pandemic, not seen in Canada since 1968-69, could kill 11,000 to 58,000 Canadians and make 2.1 million to five million ill. So why was there so much alarm over H1N1?</p>
<p>Public health officials had to react partly because of the initial death rate. Even after it became clear that H1N1 was killing fewer in Canada than in Mexico, no one knew why, and a return to the much higher death rate remained entirely possible. Ordering vaccines for everyone was a must.</p>
<p>There was a second mystery: Seasonal flu normally kills elderly people who are already weak. H1N1 killed the young and strong, while many elderly people -- exposed already in 1957 -- were not as sick.</p>
<p>Even so, Canada resisted pulling out all the stops for H1N1. This was not the full pandemic flu plan in action. That plan, adopted in 2004 but not yet used, is far more sweeping. It involves setting up 165 mobile hospitals that hold up to 200 patients each, and using refrigeration trucks or even hockey arenas as makeshift morgues.</p>
<p>So the impression that the Canadian response to H1N1 was a gross overreaction is mistaken. Besides, there is a spinoff benefit of all the H1N1 vaccinations: A huge number of Canadians now have some protection for when the next H1N1 virus hits, just as exposure to the 1957 virus gave protection this year.</p>
<p>If there's an area where the WHO and Canadian officials should perform better, it probably is communication. The term "pandemic" was never properly understood. It refers more to geography than lethality -- that is, a pandemic is a global outbreak, rather than a virus that is necessarily a major killer.</p>

<p>Albertans will soon be hearing how a protruding nail, a broken ladder and a misplaced bucket did their jobs but were ignored or forgotten so they lashed out on the job and hurt someone.</p>
<p>The inanimate job-site objects will tell their cautionary tales in television and radio ads warning Albertans to do something about the seemingly innocuous items that can turn on them if ignored.</p>
<p>The commercials sound like fairy tales or fables and differ from past safety campaigns by telling the story of preventable injuries from the tool's point of view. One ad shows a nail sticking out dangerously from a pallet as a voice tells its story: "There once was a nail without a job," the story goes.</p>
<p>"He'd done his duty proudly for years then one day it was taken from him. He was sure someone would notice and put him back to work. But no one did. Hope turned to despair. Finally, he decided he would be ignored no longer."</p>
<p>The commercial ends as a man kneeling underneath the nail stands up. Viewers don't see the injury but hear a sickening sound effect.</p>
<p>Test audiences showed hearing it was more powerful than seeing the injury, said Shawn King, chief creative officer of Extreme Group, which created the campaign.</p>
<p>"We were trying to get people to do something about what seemed like insignificant issues," King said. "We were saying that workplace injury can be prevented, but it's often the little things that you ignore that can cause injury."</p>
<p>King said past injury-prevention advertising has typically "not been interesting."</p>
<p>Alberta is using the ads which originally ran in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, and have since been adopted by New Brunswick.</p>
<p>Marilyn More, Nova Scotia's minister of labour, said Alberta shared its material developed for H1N1 in the workplace, so it's returning the favour.</p>
<p>Producing a similar campaign from scratch would have cost the government about $900,000, Employment and Immigration Minister Thomas Lukaszuk said. Recycling this provincewide campaign will cost $600,000.</p>
<p>"The trick to educational promotional campaigns is to keep on reminding and reminding because one of the biggest causes of accidents is people becoming comfortable with their work environments and forgetting the existence of dangers all around them," Lukaszuk said.</p>
<p>The provincial rate of disabling injuries fell by 6.3 per cent in 2008 to 3.63 per 100 person years worked from 3.88 in 2007. But the government's goal is to reduce current injury rates by 25 per cent by the end of 2012. For 2009, the Workers Compensation Board recorded 110 deaths, including workplace incidents, motor vehicle incidents and occupational disease.</p>
<p>"Every time there is a significant injury in Alberta, my BlackBerry vibrates and I get instantly the accident report," Lukaszuk said. "If we could only move back time one minute, because in 90 per cent of these incidents, they could have been prevented."</p>

</p>
<p>Being in the travel industry these days can be a journey of highs and lows.</p>
<p>Just ask Rhonda Stephenson, the new owner of small but influential Toronto tour operator, Canadian Travel Abroad.</p>
<p>Stephenson, a 36-year-veteran of the industry, bought CTA, a well-established tour operator, after legendary owner Himo Mansour passed away - she took control on Canada Day, 2009.</p>
<p>Since taking over CTA, though, Stephenson has had to deal with the worst economy since the Great Depression along with a worldwide outbreak of H1N1 (swine flu) - two conditions that normally spell doom for the travel industry.</p>
<p>But that hasn't deterred the energetic Stephenson, whose company is slowly making inroads in the luxury travel market, offering specialty trips to Portugal and Jordan, two of the fastest-growing travel destinations among Canadian travellers.</p>
<p>"Canadian Travel Abroad has always had a high quality image (with the public) and it is hard to improve on that, but what we are doing is making sure that our clients' needs come first," says Stephenson, who admits she and other Canadian tour operators continue to face challenging times.</p>
<p>"Overall, the travel industry has taken a hit. Numbers were down almost everywhere last year, attributable mostly to the worldwide recession. Other things (swine flu) didn't help, either," says Stephenson.</p>
<p>But that wasn't the only obstacle Stephenson faced when she assumed control of CTA. Mansour liked doing things the old fashioned way and didn't even accept credit cards.</p>
<p>Stephenson quickly changed that.</p>
<p>"If I couldn't accept them (credit cards), I'd be dead in the water," says Stephenson.</p>
<p>Next, Stephenson revamped the company's dated travel brochure and logo and invested heavily in technology. "We had to become more computerized and I invested in specialized software that enables us to be far more efficient in this very competitive and ever-changing industry," says Stephenson.</p>
<p>Then she set out to establish new relations with emerging destinations, especially Middle East countries like Jordan, home of Petra, the UNESCO Heritage Site that dates back to the sixth century BC and was recently chosen among the seven "new" Wonders of the World in a global poll.</p>
<p>New destinations help but word of mouth is where most business comes from, admits Stephenson, who is constantly developing and updating the company's informative website, www.canadiantravelabroad.com[http://www.canadiantravelabroad.com], as well as her advertising and promotional material.</p>
<p>CTA's website is detailed about destinations the company offers, including a price breakdown on packages. It also offers useful tools for travellers, like currency conversions, overseas calling codes and more.</p>
<p>Before offering destinations, Stephenson, who just returned from Jordon, makes a site inspection trip to make sure suppliers (guides, transportation companies and hotels at the destination) meet CTA's tough requirements.</p>
<p>"We want companies (at the destination) that can provide the best service to our clients at the best prices," says Stephenson, who acknowledges budget-conscious travellers are looking for more (value) for less (money).</p>
<p>Stephenson is also thinking about expanding the company's inventory to include voluntourism, a growing area of the industry which allows vacationers to help build homes and schools or work on ecological projects while on holiday.</p>
<p>"I think Canadian's would look at it as an added element to their trip and maybe like a day or two doing something like that."</p>
<p>CTA employees have been to every destination the company sells and can tell clients exactly what to expect when they arrive. Stephenson, herself, has been to Portugal over 30 times and the country remains among her favourite to visit.</p>
<p>Despite the recent economic downturn and medical fears that have scared off some travellers, Stephenson and her staff remain optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>"We foresee substantial growth in 2010, especially with our Portugal long-stay products, which appeals to the 55-plus market," says Stephenson, who points out that Canadian "snowbirds" are looking for affordable alternatives to Florida - and Portugal fits the bill.</p>
<p>Stephenson admits her journey as owner of CTA has been a wild ride so far, but the few bumps she's encountered along the way hasn't detoured her long-term ambitions.</p>

<p>OCEANIA</p>
<p>CANBERRA - Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono confirmed today that suspected terror mastermind Dulmatin had been killed in a police raid in Jakarta.</p>
<p>The president, on a three-day visit to Australia, said a raid against militants hiding out on the outskirts of the capital had resulted in the death of the man believed to have been behind the 2002 bombings on the resort island of Bali.</p>
<p>Dulmatin, an al-Qaida-trained bomber, is the suspected mastermind of some of the region's most notorious attacks and the United States' Rewards for Justice program had posted a US$10 million bounty on his head.</p>
<p>'MIRACLE' BIRTH OF BABY ELEPHANT</p>
<p>SYDNEY - A baby elephant believed to have died during labour was born alive at an Australian zoo on Wednesday, amazing its keepers and defying expert opinion that such an outcome would take a "miracle."</p>
<p>Sydney's Taronga Zoo said Monday that the calf had died in the womb after becoming trapped in a position from which there was never any chance of a successful birth.</p>
<p>"Despite overwhelming evidence that her first calf had not survived a protracted labour, Taronga's Asian Elephant Porntip delivered a male calf alive at 3:27 a.m. today," the zoo said in a statement.</p>

<p>SEVEN HELD OVER CARTOONIST 'PLOT'</p>
<p>DUBLIN - Irish police have arrested seven Muslims suspected of conspiracy to murder over an alleged plot to kill a Swedish cartoonist who drew the Prophet Mohammed with the body of a dog, they said.</p>
<p>The four men and three women were arrested Tuesday in the southern towns of Cork and Waterford in an operation co-ordinated with U.S. and European security agencies.</p>
<p>Police said that they were Muslims arrested over an alleged plot to assassinate Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks, who has a US$100,000 bounty on his head from an al-Qaida-linked group.</p>
<p>ARRESTS MADE IN BODY SNATCHING</p>
<p>NICOSIA - Cypriot police arrested three people on Tuesday in connection with the theft of the body of former president Tassos Papadopoulos, the official CNA news agency reported.</p>
<p>Police spokesman Michalis Katsounotos said "three people have been arrested tonight after arrest warrants were issued against them for questioning in connection with the theft of the body of Tassos Papadopoulos," whose body was recovered on Monday.</p>
<p>He said the three were set to be taken to Nicosia District Court today for a remand request. State television said the people arrested were an Indian holding what is believed to be a forged Bulgarian passport, an inmate currently serving a life sentence in Nicosia Central Prison and a relative of the inmate.</p>
<p>MEN SEIZED DAYS BEFORE ATTACK</p>
<p>LONDON - Five Pakistani men linked to a terror plot in Britain similar to the attacks on the London transport system in 2005 were arrested days before they planned to strike, a hearing was told Tuesday.</p>
<p>A British intelligence officer, identified only as ZR, told an immigration panel that the group had been planning to stage an atrocity in April last year, but were seized in raids in northwest England.</p>
<p>ZR compared the alleged plot to the July 7, 2005 suicide bombings on a bus and underground trains in the British capital and said they also contained similarities to the 2006 plot to bomb transatlantic jets with liquid bombs.</p>

<p>'ALL OPTIONS' NEEDED ON IRAN</p>
<p>NEW YORK - All options "should remain on the table" to force Iran to stop its nuclear program, Israel's top general said on Tuesday during a visit to New York.</p>
<p>Gabi Ashkenazi, chief of staff of Israel's armed forces, said Iran was the main threat to world peace and accused the Islamic Republic of trying to create instability in the Middle East by funding and equipping militants.</p>
<p>In November, an Israeli official said Ashkenazi told a parliamentary panel that Israel was readying all options to try to force Iran to halt its nuclear program and had suggested diplomatic or economic sanctions may also help.</p>
<p>FAMILY OF SLAIN U.S. ACTIVIST SUES ISRAEL</p>
<p>JERUSALEM - The family of an American killed by an Israeli army bulldozer in Gaza will launch a damages case today, stoking controversy over the treatment of pro-Palestinian protesters and angering Israelis frustrated by international criticism.</p>
<p>Rachel Corrie was one of several foreign activists killed in confrontations with Israel in occupied territory in the past decade. Her family is suing for $324,000 in the case, being heard by a court in the city of Haifa.</p>
<p>The Israeli army says Corrie, 23, a member of the pro-Palestinian International Solidarity Movement, was fatally struck by a concrete slab on March 16, 2003, as a bulldozer cleared a militant hideout in the Gaza area.</p>
<p>ISRAELIS TO BUILD 1,600 HOMES</p>
<p>JERUSALEM - Israel approved the construction of 1,600 new settler homes in east Jerusalem on Tuesday as U.S. vice-president Joe Biden met leading Israeli officials to boost renewed peace efforts.</p>
<p>The move angered Palestinians, who consider settlements a major hurdle in attempts to reach a peace accord, and who want occupied east Jerusalem as the capital of their promised state.</p>
<p>Biden welcomed the decision by Israeli and Palestinian leaders to resume indirect peace talks after more than a year of paralysis.</p>
<p>But the announcement of the homes in the Ramat Shlomo settlement was certain to draw criticism from Palestinians. Israel on Monday approved 112 new homes in a West Bank settlement in an exception to a partial moratorium on construction announced in November which does not include east Jerusalem.</p>

<p>RUSSIA URGES CHECHENS RETURNED</p>
<p>MOSCOW - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev urged Sweden on Tuesday to extradite two men it says are Chechen separatists who have been involved in killings and kidnappings.</p>
<p>But the issue failed to overshadow the first visit to Russia by Swedish prime minister since 2000, in which warming business ties took centre stage.</p>
<p>At a joint news conference with Fredrik Reinfeldt, Medvedev shifted the discussion to the Chechens when the issue of human rights in the Caucasus came up.</p>
<p>"If we talk about the Caucasus, apart from the human rights situation there is another problem ... the bandits who found shelter in Sweden," Medvedev said. "If we are talking about observing human rights, we also need to jointly fight crime."</p>
<p>SEOUL SHIPS MILK TO NORTH KOREA</p>
<p>SEOUL - South Korea today delivered 20 tons of powdered milk for North Korean children despite tensions over a major military exercise south of the border, Seoul officials said.</p>
<p>The cross-border shipment is part of a promised Red Cross aid package also including 10,000 tons of corn, said unification ministry spokeswoman Lee Jong-Joo.</p>
<p>In addition to food aid for the hungry North, the South sent drugs and other material to fight swine flu in December and February.</p>

<p>SPREE RELICS SHOULD BE IN MUSEUM</p>
<p>MONTEVIDEO - German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle called Tuesday for wreckage from a Nazi-era warship recovered off the coast of Uruguay to be displayed in a museum rather than auctioned to the public.</p>
<p>During a brief visit to Montevideo, Westerwelle was asked about the ongoing diplomatic dispute over parts of what was once the pride of the Nazi navy, the Admiral Graf Spee, since they were salvaged in 2006.</p>
<p>"We want to prevent wreckage from the ship, in particular the Nazi symbols, from landing on the market for military insignia," he told reporters after talks with his Uruguayan counterpart, Luis Almagro.</p>
<p>"We want the remains of the Graf Spee to be dealt with properly."</p>
<p>The ship was scuttled in 1939 in shallow waters off Montevideo. Its wreckage includes a giant bronze eagle with spread wings with a swastika under its talons -- a favoured Nazi symbol that could fetch a handsome sum at auction.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Harper government rates a B-</b>
</div><div>By John H. Redekop   </div>
<div>948 words</div><div>9 March 2010</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>Here is an assessment of the Stephen Harper Conservatives. The marks assess performance during the past year. Marks in brackets were given at the end of three years.</p>
<p>1. Cabinet Development and Performance. Generally good but Peter MacKay mishandled the Afghan torture question well and Natural Resources Minister Lisa Raitt greatly embarrassed herself by leaving secret documents in a broadcast studio and by describing the life-threatening isotope crisis as "sexy." Also, most ministers are still kept mostly silent. B- (B-)</p>
<p>2. Performance in the House of Commons. The promised improvement in question period decorum has not materialized. Performance during debates is commendable. Uncensored documents should be released to party leaders. C+ (B-)</p>
<p>3. Social Policies. Commendation is deserved for making EI available for the self-employed; for strengthening internet child porn laws, for increased funding for health inspection of food, and for extending parental benefits for self-employed parents. Negatively we have mismanagement of the H1N1 vaccine supply although it was the Liberals who awarded the monopoly supply contract, and continuing delays in immigration reforms. A- (A-)</p>
<p>4. Economic Policies. Massive deficit spending was probably warranted but is daunting and foreboding. Hopes for an early reversal of trends are tempered by the fact that since taking office the Harper government each year increased program spending by more than the rate of inflation combined with growth of the economy. Canada now adds about $153 million a day to its debt.</p>
<p>The Harper government deserves credit for its general management of the economy, for establishing the tax-free savings account, and for sensible implementation of its stimulus package. (A) (A)</p>
<p>5. Foreign Affairs. Although the government's record in Afghanistan is generally commendable, the torture accusations were handled badly. Instead of insisting there was no problem and discrediting witnesses, Defence Minister Peter MacKay should have acknowledged the probability of misdeeds in that chaotic country and pledged to ensure investigation and correction. Whatever the merits of fighting political and court pressures to bring Omar Khadr home from Guantanamo, that, too, was mishandled and angered many voters. The fact that Canada has slipped from 10th to 13th as a foreign aid donor country is also regrettable. Harper deserves credit for improving relations with China, for quick aid for Haiti, and for an increasing role in international affairs. B - (B-)</p>
<p>6. National Unity Policies. Despite Quebec's predictable and perennial complaints, the Harper record is commendable. Many Canadians, however, resent Heritage Minister James Moore awarding almost 40 per cent of Canada Day funding to Quebec. A- (A-)</p>
<p>7. Environmental Policies. Shrinking glaciers, collapsing salmon stocks and the warming Arctic indicate major changes. Even if climate change is partly beyond human influence, governments can ameliorate the trend. Unfortunately, the World Wildlife Fund now ranks Canada last among G8 nations in addressing climate concerns. C (C+)</p>
<p>8. Crime and Justice Issues. Although insufficient resources are targeted for prevention, the record on crime and justice issues is strong. Unfortunately, the two-month prorogation killed more than 20 commendable bills. Also positive is the decision to end the $1 billion long-gun registry boondoggle. Lamentable are the perplexing delays in appointing judges, causing major civil cases to be dropped, and the failure to address the irresponsible decisions of human rights commissions which Harper, in a 1999 interview, correctly described as "an attack on our fundamental freedoms and the basic existence of a democratic society." B+ (A-)</p>
<p>9. Defence and Military Policies. Aside from the questionable policy of trying to bring democracy to a backward Muslim country such as Afghanistan, the policies otherwise are mostly commendable. B+ (C+)</p>
<p>10. Parliamentary Reform. Given constitutional obstacles, little can be done to achieve Senate reform. The eight-year limitation on new appointees is a positive step. Childish behaviour in question period persists. B (B)</p>
<p>11. Specific Initiatives. Kudos for generous support of the Olympics, for the $50 million grant to remove traffic bottlenecks at Vancouver ports, and for assertions of sovereignty in the Arctic. Criticisms for permitting the sale of much of Nortel to Ericson of Sweden, for giving $400,000 to Toronto's Gay Pride parade, for hassling the Dutch about recruiting Canadians for their Olympic House, for permitting Korea to sell cars in Canada while Korea bans Canadian car imports, and for insisting on costly federal duplication of B.C.'s environmental assessment of mines. A- (A+)</p>
<p>12. Keeping Electoral Promises. Basic commitments have generally been kept but capital gains tax reform, promised in the 2006 election campaign, has not materialized.</p>
<p>13. Overall Performance of the prime minister. Harper has generally been an effective and successful leader in domestic and foreign arenas. He is a good communicator but, unfortunately, sells himself short by not scheduling more news conferences and by rarely addressing Canadians directly. His two-month prorogation of Parliament has cost him much political support. It is not credible to argue that a leader, surrounded by a small army of assistants and advisers, requires two months to determine priorities. B- (C+)</p>
<p>The overall mark for the last year: B- (B)</p>
<p>The Harper record is strong enough to warrant a majority win. If that is denied by the voters in an early election, then the Conservatives will have no one to blame but themselves. They should then look into a mirror where they will find three statements in bold font: Prorogation of Parliament, mishandling of the torture accusations and, mishandling of the Omar Khadr affair.</p>

<div>DEATH CARE</div>
<div>Report on Business: Canadian</div>
<div id="hd"><b>The funeral business shows a little life; The industry is recovering from a downturn in 2009, and its prospects look better than ever as baby boomers age</b>
</div><div>RICHARD BLACKWELL    </div>
<div>794 words</div><div>9 March 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    </div>
</p>
<p>The North American funeral business is showing signs of life.</p>
<p>A year ago, most public “death care” companies were reporting mysterious drops in the number of funerals they were performing, but now things have improved and some are seeing growth close to long-term trends.</p>
<p>And all of the companies in the funeral industry are looking forward to the next few decades, when business should be brisk as baby boomers come to the end of their run.</p>
<p>The hardest-hit company last year was <span class="companylink">Service Corporation International</span>, the biggest death care company on the continent, with more than 1,600 funeral homes and cemeteries in the United States and Canada. In the first quarter of 2009 it experienced an 11-per-cent downturn in the number of funerals it performed. While the quarter-to-quarter decline was only 3.6 per cent by the fourth quarter, the company conducted 6.7 per cent fewer funerals in all of 2009 than it did in 2008.</p>
<p>Houston-based SCI was so puzzled by the downturn that it hired outside consultants to find out why. The research is not complete, so the company won't release it yet, but chief executive officer Tom Ryan told a recent conference call with analysts that there appear to be two major factors: medical advances, and a dip in the number of births between 1929 and 1936, the deepest years of the Depression.</p>
<p>“We know those two events are going to put downward pressure on the numbers of deaths in our relevant markets,” Mr. Ryan said. “We're operating under the assumption that we're probably going to see down comparable [funeral] volumes generally for the next few years.”</p>
<p>But he also noted that death rates are very volatile, and any dips “can be overcome temporarily by big flu seasons [or] other types of things that could drive deaths.”</p>
<p>Over the long-term, however, business can only grow as the baby boom bubble moves into its advanced years, he said. While they may not be ready to die yet, many are starting to pay for prearranged funerals. “The good news is we are selling to the next generation,” Mr. Ryan said yesterday at an investor conference in Orlando, Fla.</p>
<p>In Canada, the biggest funeral provider is <span class="companylink">Arbor Memorial Services Inc</span>., a Toronto-based company that owns 82 funeral homes and 41 cemeteries.</p>
<p>It did not experience the same sharp drop in funeral volumes as SCI or many of the other large U.S. death care firms last year, but the number of funerals it performed in 2009 was off slightly, with the trough – a decline of 3 per cent – in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Arbor chief executive officer Brian Snowdon said Mr. Ryan's explanation for the decline in the number of funerals makes sense. He also noted that influenza deaths have been down in the past year or so, and the impact of the H1N1 virus was much less than expected.</p>
<p>He dismissed the possibility that customers are abandoning the large public funeral operators for smaller independents that don't report their numbers. Suppliers to the industry report the same kind of soft numbers for everyone, he said.</p>
<p>And while health care improvements could certainly cut into the number of deaths in the short term, that's only temporary, he said. “Medical advances aren't going to keep people from coming through our doors forever, but they will delay [things].”</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Snowdon said the increase in population and the large numbers of people who are entering their senior years bodes very well for the industry in the long run. Even though people are living longer, the increasing numbers of the elderly must eventually translate into more deaths.</p>
<p>Overall, Statistics Canada projects that the number of deaths per year in Canada will roughly double in the next half-century.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Laurier defeats Gryphons to win women's OUA title</b>
</div><div>Rob Massey   </div>

<div>775 words</div><div>8 March 2010</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Despite the pain of losing their second consecutive OUA women's hockey league championship series to the Laurier Golden Hawks, the Guelph Gryphons exit the season feeling good about where they're headed.</p>
<p>The Golden Hawks celebrated their seventh consecutive league championship on the Gryphon Centre ice Saturday afternoon. They grabbed a 2-1 lead in the first period and made it stand through the remainder of the game to complete a two-game sweep of the best-of-three final. Laurier had won the opener 2-0 in Waterloo Thursday.</p>
<p>"I'm really proud of the girls and they should be proud of themselves," Guelph head coach Rachel Flanagan said. "They put up an amazing fight. Every game we've played against Laurier this year, well, in the last two years, has been a fight right to the end."</p>
<p>While the end result this season was the same as last season, the Gryphs took a tougher path to get to the final. Last season, the Gryphs finished second in league play to earn a bye in the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>They disposed of the Brock Badgers in the semifinals and then lost in three games, all decided by a single goal, in the final.</p>
<p>This time, the Gryphs were stung twice by the H1N1 flu in the regular season.</p>
<p>First, they had to postpone a pair of weekend road games in November against the York Lions and Toronto Blues. Those games were then rescheduled on back-to-back days at the start of 2010, throwing the Gryphs right into a hectic schedule of four games in six days on their welcome back from the Christmas and exam break.</p>
<p>They went 1-2-1 in that stretch and wore themselves out.</p>
<p>Those games played a big part in Guelph's fourth-place finish at the end of the regular season. That finish meant they had to play a single-game quarter-final against Toronto and would also not have home-ice advantage in a semifinal series against the emerging Queen's Gaels. As it turned out, they didn't need home-ice advantage, as they defeated the Gaels in two games.</p>
<p>And they again advanced to meet the Golden Hawks in the final.</p>
<p>While it was over in two games this time, it was two close games.</p>
<p>Katherine Shirriff on a power play and Devon Skeats scored for the Golden Hawks on Saturday.</p>
<p>Erin Small's goal for the Gryphons was sandwiched between the two Laurier goals. Emily Corbett and Jessica Zerafa assisted on the goal.</p>
<p>Guelph outshot Laurier 22-16, including a 10-5 margin after the first period.</p>
<p>However, most of the shots were from outside the slot area as Laurier's defence kept that area clean for most of the match.</p>
<p>"They spent the last two periods just dumping the puck in, almost an aggressive trap," Flanagan said. "We tried to make adjustments and I think we did fairly well, but we didn't get many opportunities around their net. They're a great skating team and they're on you as soon as you get the puck."</p>
<p>Liz Knox picked up the win for the Golden Hawks in net while Danielle Skoufranis took the loss.</p>
<p>Laurier advances to the national championship tournament at Antigonish, N.S., March 11-14.</p>
<p>The Gryphs look ahead to next season with anticipation. The only player they'll lose to graduation is goaltender Chelsey Roy, although it's likely that not all of the remaining players will be back.</p>
<p>"We're not graduating a lot of players," Flanagan said. "But, inevitably, things change anyways. The plan is we only graduate one, technically."</p>
<p>That's good news for a team that has been to the final two consecutive years.</p>
<p>"We didn't graduate a lot last year and we were really young last year," Flanagan said. "We didn't graduate a lot, but we had a lot of new faces come in at the beginning of this year because of circumstances - some people decided not to come back. We've been a young team since I've been coaching (two years) and now we're starting to get into a position where we're a little more mature and our years are a little more spread out. We don't have 13 rookies or anything like that. We're hoping to have a smaller rookie class next year."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Jean Coutu stock on path to good health; Free of Rite Aid shackles, drugstore chain poised to profit from purchase of generic drug maker Pro Doc</b>
</div><div>JOHN HEINZL   </div>
<div>919 words</div><div>8 March 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>B9</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

   </div>
</p>
<p>INVESTMENT REPORTER</p>
<p>For years, Jean Coutu Group's stock was sicker than some of the customers who visit its drugstores.</p>
<p>From a high of nearly $22 in 2005, the shares plunged to about $6 in late 2008, hammered by the financial crisis and by its disastrous foray into the U.S. market.</p>
<p>But lately, the stock's been on the mend, and executives of Quebec's largest drugstore chain are sounding remarkably upbeat. Sales and profits are rising as the company opens new stores, expands existing ones and rolls out more high-margin private label products.</p>
<p>What's more, Jean Coutu is poised to capture a growing share of the lucrative generic drug market with its 2007 purchase of Pro Doc Ltée., a fast-growing generic manufacturer.</p>
<p>“Those of you who have visited our stores can see the difference. Our stores are bigger. Our stores are probably in better shape than ever before,” chief executive officer François Coutu, son of chairman and founder Jean Coutu, said on the third-quarter conference call in January. “We're on a roll.”</p>
<p>Analysts agree. Of the 11 analysts who follow the company, seven have a “buy” recommendation on the stock, three have a “hold” and just one has a “sell.” The average target price is $11.50 – an 18-per-cent premium to Friday's close of $9.75.</p>
<p>Why such optimism? One reason is that the troubled U.S. Rite Aid Corp. chain is no longer hammering Jean Coutu's bottom line. Last year, the Canadian company wrote off its 28.4-per-cent equity stake after its share of <span class="companylink">Rite Aid</span>'s losses exceeded the carrying value on its books.</p>
<p>That removed a big distraction for shareholders, said Colum McKinley, portfolio manager with Sionna Investment Managers. Sionna began acquiring Jean Coutu stock in early 2008 and made a profit on its shares, a portion of which it has since sold.</p>
<p>With <span class="companylink">Rite Aid</span> no longer dragging down Jean Coutu's results, “investors aren't seeing the downside from quarter to quarter. But eventually, if Jean Coutu were to sell or exit that position, there's a potential for them to have a financial windfall,” he said. Based on <span class="companylink">Rite Aid</span>'s closing price of $1.51 (U.S.) on Friday, Jean Coutu's 252 million shares are worth about $380-million.</p>
<p>In Canada, Jean Coutu is coming off an unusually strong third quarter, when the H1N1 flu pandemic helped to boost same-store sales of non-prescription items by 6.6 per cent.</p>
<p>“While customers were in the store buying cough and cold medicine, antibacterial gels and masks, they picked up a lot more beauty products, confectionery and cosmetics as well,” <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> analyst Michael Van Aelst said in a note.</p>
<p>Such a strong sales increase “is not realistically sustainable, in our view,” he said. But he remains bullish on the stock, citing store expansions and renovations, better merchandising, tighter inventory control and – perhaps most important – the growing contribution of Pro Doc.</p>
<p>Pro Doc manufactures generic drugs and its sales are growing quickly as health insurers seek to control health care costs. In the third-quarter ended Nov. 28, Pro Doc's revenue nearly tripled to $26.8-million (Canadian) from a year earlier.</p>
<p>As Pro Doc manufactures a wider selection of generic drugs, and as more Jean Coutu franchisees buy from it, its sales should continue growing, analysts say.</p>
<p>Kathleen Wong, an analyst with Veritas Investment Research, said Pro Doc has a big opportunity as branded drugs with annual sales of about $150-billion (U.S.) are expected to lose patent protection over the next five years, including <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span>'s cholesterol pill Lipitor, the world's top-selling drug.</p>
<p>“Jean Coutu bought Pro Doc to get vertical integration,” she said. As its sales grow, “Pro Doc is going to increase the profit margin for Jean Coutu.” She rates Jean Coutu a “buy” with an intrinsic value estimate of $11.20 (Canadian) a share.</p>
<p>Longer term, a key question is how Jean Coutu will be able to generate additional growth, Mr. McKinley said.</p>
<p>“They are somewhat opportunity-constrained. How will they ever grow beyond [their core market in Quebec]? They tried to grow in the United States and it didn't work,” he said.</p>
<p>“If you reach that point when you can't grow your business effectively and generate strong returns for shareholders, then I think the prudent thing to do is return capital to shareholders. And the mechanisms to do that are through strong dividends and share buybacks.”</p>
<p>Jean Coutu has raised its dividend twice in the past three years – it now pays 18 cents annually, for a yield of 1.9 per cent – and more hikes are possible, Mr. McKinley said. That's a welcome change from the previous five years, when the dividend didn't budge. It's also one of the clearest signs that the company has turned the corner.</p>

</p>
<p>The province's third quarterly financial report, released Thursday, announced that the projected deficit for 2009/10 will be less than what was originally feared. It is expected to be $555 million, some $37 million below the last projection.</p>
<p>It is a political tradition for every government to congratulate itself on doing yeoman's service in managing the public treasury, even when the red ink flows. The Selinger government points out, accurately, that Manitoba's deficit is lower than that of other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The latest report on how the finances are shaping up shows while some expenses are up, others are down and shortfalls in some revenues -- $90 million less from corporate income tax; $10 million less from retail sales -- have been buffered a little by the money flowing in elsewhere, especially in personal income tax, even as the unemployment rate rose.</p>
<p>The bad news continues: Manitobans are spending less on gambling and on drinking, which, oddly, seems both intuitive and counterintuitive during a recession. Last year, the economy shrank further than was expected, falling by 0.3 per cent. This year Manitoba's economic growth, pegged at 2.4 per cent, will be below the Canadian average.</p>
<p>So the salad days are over for the NDP administration. The transfer payments from Ottawa will flow apace until 2013, but as revenues shrink, the expansion of programs and spending of the last 10 years cannot continue.</p>
<p>The work ahead -- the next budget will be revealed March 23 -- is to dig out of deficit financing, hence the recently announced two-year wage freeze to public servant salaries. Holding the line on salaries of nurses and doctors alone will save tens of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>But, held in check by balanced budget legislation, will Finance Minister Rosann Wowchuk find the discipline and resources to get back to balanced? How can Manitoba tame its expenditure monster, whose appetite is driven by the insatiable health and education budgets?</p>
<p>The last quarterly report holds some clue as to how that can be done. On Thursday, the government explained in the details of the quarterly report it was making use of a provision within the balanced budget law that allows it to erase $90 million in H1N1 spending from the equation that requires it to get to balance in a four-year average. Conveniently excluded from the press release, this exemption is allowed because it was an "extraordinary" and unanticipated expense, something akin to disaster management. That $90 million gets removed entirely from the four-year rolling average.</p>
<p>That average as of April 1, is expected to show a $253-million surplus. So -- ahead of the game, by a respectable margin. The margin was made possible by the former Doer government's decision to substantially alter the balanced budget law, which previously insisted that budgets must be balanced in each year, not over four years. Under the original law, the exemption for unanticipated costs was prudent and fair.</p>
<p>Having last year eliminated the requirement for minimum debt payment, it appears the provincial government will "manage" its way quite nicely through these rough recessionary waters. Budgeting is an exercise in accounting; positioning the numbers is a political art.</p>

</p>
<p>The housecleaning in Premier Ed Stelmach's office is now over, and the guy with the broom, chief of staff Ron Glen, is still in charge.</p>
<p>Stelmach's most ardent loyalist, Glen has been the target of much abuse within the Tory party, although not to his face. He's a powerful man.</p>
<p>Glen was never in danger of getting the boot. Instead, all the top people the premier's communications setup have moved or left in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Nobody was fired. Glen and Stelmach don't dump staffers. Former media handler Tom Olsen, for instance, is now in charge of developing a government social media strategy.</p>
<p>"We're a team and one of our goals is not to blame communications on people on the team," Glen says.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to take people and throw them off the bus. We focus on putting people where they can do the best job."</p>
<p>On Friday, Stelmach and Glen made the most significant hire of all, taking on a fellow named Lee Funke to run the Public Affairs Bureau. He's the brains behind a perfectly named firm, Torque Communications, and the mastermind of Alberta's campaign to save the hog industry during the swine flu crisis.</p>
<p>Funke "was recruited for this job," says Glen. Stelmach was impressed with Funke's consulting on the land-use strategy, a potentially explosive piece of business that went very smoothly.</p>
<p>In an interview -- a rare thing for him -- Glen promises much more consultation with the public in the next two years.</p>
<p>He says the government had to take quick action on issues like power line Bill 50 and health-care restructuring. This meant moving ahead without much public input. People got upset. But he feels there was no choice.</p>
<p>"Two years ago, when we got our mandate, we inherited a house with a garage full of old stuff," Glen says. "We had to clean up. There was pent-up demand for action on a number of files."</p>
<p>The power line problem "hadn't been dealt with for about eight years. There was no wiggle room left. If he hadn't moved very quickly, there would have been rotating brownouts four or five years from now."</p>
<p>But as Glen knows, the government looked almost dictatorial for pushing through such a radical policy shift, with heavy costs to consumers, and without serious consultation. Health-care upheaval made the problem worse.</p>
<p>"People do appreciate decisiveness, but only after they've had an opportunity to review the evidence," he concedes. From now on, he promises, they'll have that opportunity, because there are no lingering issues that demand such urgent action.</p>
<p>Glen doesn't want to change the province's new slogan -- Freedom to Create, Spirit to Achieve -- because he thinks it states Alberta's character beyond our borders.</p>
<p>"It talks to how Albertans want to be seen in the world as not just a group that will put the economy ahead of everything else," he says.</p>
<p>"As we emerge from this recession, we have the ability to leapfrog over other jurisdictions. We're going to be seeing people come here from places where they don't have freedom.</p>
<p>"The motto and branding strategy speaks to a more modern Alberta, one that has a bigger outlook on life."</p>
<p>Glen concedes 2009 was rough for the government, as an unexpected recession dovetailed with the major policy shifts.</p>
<p>"That presented a political opportunity for others," he says, without naming the Wildrose Alliance. "Everything combined to make a difficult year for us.</p>
<p>"But now we are at midterm. We can move forward, saying that the things that had to be done have been done. And we have to prove to Albertans that those things were done in their best interests."</p>
<p>Whatever they do, Ron Glen will still have a hand in all of it.</p>

</p>
<p>Shakespearean actors with ears connected to iPods? A stage equipped with hand-sanitizer pumps? Welcome to Peter Hinton's post-H1N1 The Comedy of Errors, wherein Balthazar carries a laptop and wears a bluetooth.</p>
<p>The visual winks in this fast-paced, playful production are legion. More important, the actors give such fresh readings to well-worn lines (written in times of bubonic plague) that the end seems to arrive too soon - after nearly two hours sans intermission.</p>
<p>The cast, which includes a number of fine local anglo actors who may not have had a crack at playing Shakespeare (indoors) since theatre school, is amazingly, deliciously good.</p>
<p>True, Stratford/Théâtre du Nouveau Monde veteran Albert Millaire, of wonderfully resonant voice, doesn't quite conquer the dutiful-listen nature of Aegeon's introductory "griefs unspeakable" narrative about the loss of wife, twin sons and twin servants to the sea. (Like Prospero's tale in The Tempest, it's windy.) But the rest of the team soon sets a brisker pace.</p>
<p>Once the two gender-bending Dromios start clowning around (Debra Kirshenbaum as the scene-stealing Dromio of Ephesus, Danielle Desormeaux as his twin of Syracuse), and their twin masters, Antipholus of Ephesus (Andreas Apergis) and Antipholus of Syracuse (Marcel Jeannin), begin to find themselves in a ludicrous state of identity confusion, laughter is never far away. Danette Mackay, as devoted-wife Adriana, and Leni Parker, as her scarlet-stockinged spinster sister, Luciana, raise the game another notch, never wasting a comma, let alone a line.</p>
<p>But it's Stephen Lawson, in drag, as the scorned Ephesian courtesan in search of her jewellery, who stops the show with his deftly achieved Beyoncé Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It) moment. And Clare Coulter, as the Abbess/ Amelia, is not to be outdone. Along with Parker and Mackay, she transforms the abbey gate confrontation into a tour-de-force. And her final exit line, "After so long grief, such felicity!" lingers in the mind. (Purists will note that she says "felicity" not "festivity" or "nativity." Which folio?) Other able performers include Paul Rainville, as a Paranormal TV host (a funny scene that overplays its multi-media hand); Adrienne Mei Irving, as Adriana's maid, Luce; and Braulio Elicer, as the cellphone-toting goldsmith.</p>
<p>Set and costume designer Eo Sharp deserves kudos for the zany, urbane look. Silver-paneled walls that encase all in sterile modernity also ably highlight significant props, like the model-sized tall ship that suggests the shipwreck; a small portrait of Queen Elizabeth II (rather than I) reminding us of the diminished-but-tenacious monarchy; and a clock without hands, hinting at the timeless nature of the work.</p>
<p>Troy Slocum's soundtrack samples pop music, with discretion.</p>
<p>Visible indications of Hinton's Ephesus-as-Montreal concept are intermittent rather than omnipresent: riot-cop costumes, a Bixi bike, a Via Rail sign and a billboard for a Star Wars costume party at Café Cléopâtre. The joie de vivre, however, is unmistakable. This is upbeat, farcical Shakespeare, that nevertheless manages to draw a tear or two at family reconciliation time.</p>
<p>Hinton has cast bravely, coached and curated well. Bravo! Once this Comedy of Errors completes its Montreal run, it will move on to the NAC in Ottawa.</p>
<p>The Comedy of Errors, by William Shakespeare, continues at Centaur Theatre, 453 St. François Xavier St., until March 28. Call 514-288-3161 or visit www.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>ROAD TO RECOVERY - A year after the crack of doom, the economy is humming along</b>
</div><div>By Geoff Kirbyson   </div>

</p>
<p>What a difference a year has made.</p>
<p>This Tuesday marks the one-year anniversary of the bottoming out of the Toronto Stock Exchange composite index at 7,479, a precipitous fall of 50 per cent from just a year earlier.</p>
<p>It was a day the sky was falling, the earth was ending and the pending failure of all things financial was about to trigger a return to the Stone Age.</p>
<p>But thanks to billions of dollars of stimulus packages doled out around the globe and a move into the recovery phase of the business cycle, the nuclear winter so many feared turned out to be, well, pretty much like every other recession we've had over the past century.</p>
<p>John McCallum, a finance professor at the I.H. Asper School of Business at the University of Manitoba, said there's no question the markets were in terrible shape a year ago but the worst part about it was the pervasive feeling they were never going to bottom out.</p>
<p>"Psychologically, I think people were expecting a lot worse than actually materialized," he said.</p>
<p>Back on that dark day -- it was a Monday, in case you've forgotten -- had you wanted to bet the Canadian economy would respond by churning out GDP growth of 0.6 per cent in December -- that's 7.2 per cent on an annualized basis -- you'd have had people lining up around the block to take your money.</p>
<p>McCallum said the seemingly miraculous recovery can be explained by the "unbelievable power" to affect an economy over the short term with zero per cent policy interest rates in North America, Europe and Japan and the "most stunning peace-time fiscal stimulus in the lifetime of anybody alive today."</p>
<p>"Zero interest rates in Canada on top of a $55-billion deficit can have all kinds of consequences but in the short term, they absolutely propel an economy," he said. "That explains how we're growing at five per cent (GDP) now, when a year ago everybody thought the end was nigh."</p>
<p>As predicted a year ago, Manitoba's highly diversified economy meant it was able to dodge the recessionary bullet that pierced so many other provinces. But now, the flipside is the Manitoba economy will be putting along in second gear while Ontario, Alberta and B.C. speed away. It's a combination of that same diverse economy and Manitoba's heavy dependence on federal transfers.</p>
<p>"If you're a have-not province like Manitoba, Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, your dependence on Ottawa ensured you would be slower to take the hit of the recession. The bad news is Manitoba is going to lag in the recovery. We have a lot more to lose from Ottawa dealing with its deficit than Alberta does because we get a lot more of Ottawa's deficit than Alberta does," McCallum said.</p>
<p>Michael Bennaroch, dean of the faculty of business and economics at the University of Winnipeg, doesn't think any one sector will shoot the lights out in Manitoba this year, but that's nothing new.</p>
<p>"The housing market remains strong, consumer spending remains strong and Manitoba has held its own in income growth. I think we'll have fairly balanced growth across the economy and Manitoba will make a bit of a comeback," he said.</p>
<p>But all bets could be off if Ottawa slashes transfer payments to the provinces.</p>
<p>Manitoba has already experienced higher-than-expected expenses for dealing with the H1N1 pandemic and lower-than-expected tax revenue, he said.</p>
<p>Federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said in his budget speech Thursday he would not cut transfer payments, which were worth $4 billion to Manitoba last year. That's about 40 per cent of the provincial budget. But there was widespread skepticism about his predictions, particularly his assertion that deficits will disappear by 2015 through careful management and economic growth, but without tax increases or cuts to the provinces.</p>
<p>"The Manitoba government is probably going to tighten its belt (in 2010)," Bennaroch said. "They've already hinted to that by telling the civil service to be wary and public institutions dependent on government money not to expect the increases they were getting in the past."</p>
<p>McCallum predicted the role of Manitoba's minister of finance -- Rosann Wowchuk took over the portfolio when Greg Selinger became premier -- is going to be "no fun at all" for the next couple of years.</p>
<p>In spite of Flaherty's assurances, many fear he won't stick to his plan to maintain transfer payments. As well, 10 per cent of the province's manufacturing jobs have disappeared over the past year and the loonie remains within striking distance of parity with the U.S. dollar, which eats away at the competitiveness of our exporters.</p>
<p>"Three years ago, we were in the sweet spot of Manitoba's economic cycle. We had a competitive dollar, big federal transfers, decent commodity prices, a strong U.S. economy and all kinds of federally funded construction projects, like the floodway. Whatever the opposite of sweet is, that's the part of the cycle we're in now," McCallum said.</p>
<p>March 9 may be the anniversary of stock markets hitting their lows, but the economic crash occurred five months earlier, said Joseph Warbanski, head economic statistician at the Manitoba Bureau of Statistics.</p>
<p>"The crash took a while to unwind," he said.</p>
<p>Warbanski said Manitoba's GDP was down 0.3 per cent on an annualized basis in 2009, a far cry from the 2.6 decline for the entire country. Newfoundland and Labrador jumped down the deepest elevator shaft, falling 4.0 per cent, followed by Ontario (-3.4 per cent), Alberta (-2.7 per cent), B.C. (-2.4 per cent) and Saskatchewan (-1.7 per cent).</p>
<p>Manitoba was also one of just three provinces to create jobs in 2009. Even though net employment only inched up by 200 positions, it was a far cry from Ontario, which lost 161,000 jobs, or B.C., which saw 45,000 disappear. All told, the number of employed Canadians fell by 275,000 in 2009, Warbanski said.</p>
<p>He said he's optimistic whatever stimulus money is left over will soon be deployed, nudging the recovery along.</p>
<p>"Very few people would state with absolute certainty that we've seen the worst. There is hope, but significant damage was done to the global economy," he said.</p>
<p>Tim Burt, CEO of <span class="companylink">Cardinal Capital Management</span>, said most people have already forgotten how dire things seemed a year ago because of the strong recovery of the TSX over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>The TSX closed out the week at 11,975 -- up about 4,400 points from bottom-out Monday a year ago.</p>
<p>"It's not foremost on their minds anymore," Burt said. "But it goes to show you how extreme human emotions can get and how they cause people to do irrational things. You had people bailing out of the markets a year ago because they thought the world as we knew it was ending, there would be a global financial meltdown and every business, bank and country was going to fail."</p>
<p>Even though governments were scrambling to find ways out of the mess, many people lost confidence in their elected officials to find a solution.</p>
<p>Burt said he had one client who wanted out so badly he sold his entire portfolio on March 9, turning the buy-low, sell-high mantra right on its head. A new client came on board the same day and bought up everything the guy was selling.</p>
<p>"He's up close to 100 per cent right now," Burt said.</p>
<p>He said he's confident there's nowhere to go but up from here and he predicts the stock market will hit new highs in the summer of 2011. He said strong economic growth for 2010 and into next year will lead to higher corporate profits, and, coupled with higher commodity prices, will send the TSX to new heights.</p>
<p>"The Canadian stock market is very sensitive to commodity prices. Energy prices alone will likely push us to new highs. The global economy, and those of Canada, the U.S., China and India, in particular, should be firing on all cylinders. The real estate crisis will be behind us, too. I don't think it's a big stretch to forecast (record highs) by July 2011. I think that's conservative," he said.</p>
<p>How high the markets will go remains to be seen but Burt predicts they'll probably go higher than they should. Just as the psychological pendulum swung too far to the fear side more than a year ago, it will likely do the same in the opposite direction in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>Burt said the stock market is a leading indicator of where the overall economy is headed. Many people who think current valuations are too rich and the economy is poised to fall back are basing their conclusions on the past 12 months, not on the next 24 months, he said.</p>
<p>"(The markets) reflect future events, not historical ones," he said.</p>
<p>geoff.kirbyson@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Where and how</p>
<p>So, where do we go from here? Forecasters are calling for modest economic growth this year, in line with or slightly below predictions for Canada. BMO Capital Markets' research points to 2.4 per cent GDP growth in Manitoba in 2010 and 3.1 per cent next year, compared to national totals of 2.6 per cent and 3.6 per cent.</p>
<p>"Manitoba will continue its steady-as-she-goes performance, not suffering as much during recession, but not participating as fully in recovery," BMO said in its latest Provincial Monitor.</p>
<p>The Royal Bank, meanwhile, expects Manitoba's economy to churn out 3.0 per cent and 4.0 per cent growth this year and next, respectively. It said the province's fortunes stand to improve because of further recovery in both the Canadian and U.S. economies.</p>
<p>"This will result in both increased demand for provincially produced products, such as electricity, aerospace equipment and urban transit buses, and higher prices for natural resource commodities," RBC said in its latest Provincial Outlook report.</p>
<p>Barry Rempel, president and CEO of the Winnipeg Airports Authority, said the transportation industry is another leading indicator for the economy. He said air travel tends to rebound first, followed by trucking. Then salespeople start getting on airplanes to visit clients in other cities and finally, the general public will start booking holidays and pleasure trips.</p>
<p>"The public is still lagging. They see people impacted with unemployment or companies cutting back and they don't have consumer confidence," he said. "We're starting to see the companies that need goods are ordering the raw materials."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>HEADING FOR TROUBLE - A CONCUSSION can mean it's safest to hang up the skates</b>
</div><div>By Tim Campbell   </div>
<div>2038 words</div><div>6 March 2010</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Jamie Heward takes a lot less for granted than he used to.</p>
<p>It's a self-imposed side-effect from having suffered as many as 20 concussions, some from hockey, some from normal kid activities and falls, up to the end of his NHL career at age 37.</p>
<p>The last, when he was hit from behind by reckless superstar Alexander Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals, knocking his head hard and awkwardly into the glass on Jan. 1, 2009, was one too many for the Tampa Bay Lightning player.</p>
<p>Heward was unconscious for a minute. He was then carried off the Washington ice on a stretcher. To this day, he remembers little about the events before and after that hit.</p>
<p>"All my symptoms from before came back," the Regina native says.</p>
<p>Those included feeling like he was floating in space, not remembering his wife's name, not remembering where he was. There was even a time when he went golfing on a summer day and an hour after returning home, couldn't remember playing any golf and denied he had.</p>
<p>After the hit by Ovechkin -- one Heward still says he has trouble watching -- he couldn't remember flying home to Tampa after the game. He does remember staying in bed in his dark hotel room for days on end after that, ordering room service and then resuming sleeping in that dark brain fog that concussions can cause.</p>
<p>When he was finally up and about after nearly a week, he tried to point himself to a return to the Lightning's lineup, but knew there was trouble.</p>
<p>"HD TVs, everybody loves them today, but I couldn't watch them," Heward says. "I couldn't even watch a game from up top (the press box), just couldn't concentrate."</p>
<p>Heward, like most injured players, turned his thoughts to his job.</p>
<p>"My first reaction was, 'I'm not going to get paid. Somebody's going to take my job.' At times, professional hockey players, they're their own worst enemies."</p>
<p>Heward admitted that he started telling the Lightning trainers he was feeling fine, that he was better, that he, in fact, was having "great days." He was caught more than once in the deception.</p>
<p>That short-circuited his progress through a strict set of steps NHL players and other athletes must pass in order to return to play. Those protocols include monitoring of symptoms and actual testing of mental sharpness and comparing the results to a baseline test completed when the player was fine.</p>
<p>"No matter what kind of injury it is, you always feel you're letting the team and yourself down," Heward says. "It's a kind of withdrawal, that this is all I've ever done, this is all I want to do and now I can't do it.</p>
<p>"It's good to be part of the team, but as soon as they put on their skates, you're left all by yourself sitting in the training room. It's a sense of emptiness. Why am I not better? I should be better. I'm going to tell them I'm better so I can get back on the ice."</p>
<p>Heward's symptoms last season did not abate until May.</p>
<p>"I was OK after six months in the doctor's eyes," he says. "But not in my eyes. I still have symptoms."</p>
<p>After 394 NHL games, Heward is now spending some of his time working with minor hockey teams in Regina and sharing the message about concussion education and prevention where he can.</p>
<p>"The (return-to-play) protocols may have ended my career but might have saved my life," Heward says. "I want to remember my kids, my wife."</p>
<p>When the brain rattles around in a skull, there is bruising and tearing. This damage is a concussion, whether or not consciousness is lost.</p>
<p>The sudden force could be from a fall, a car accident or innocent horseplay. In hockey, it's often from the boards, the ice or the shoulder, elbow or fist of an opponent. The NHL has past data that shows that 42 per cent of concussions come from head contact with boards, glass or ice; 40 per cent come from an elbow, forearm or shoulder to the head; 12 per cent come from fighting and six per cent come from a puck or stick to the head.</p>
<p>Statistics, incidents like Heward's and an injury that's damaging its elite workforce will be like stars aligning early next week when NHL GM's meet in Florida. The top of their agenda will be how they might revise rules to outlaw some of the dangerous contact to the head.</p>
<p>In the real world, the understanding of concussions is constantly improving -- welcome news, given that trauma is the leading cause of death among Canadians under 44, and that of those trauma deaths, head trauma is No. 1 on the list.</p>
<p>"Imagine if concussions had received all the attention that H1N1 received," says Toronto neurosurgeon Dr. Charles Tator, one of Canada's top concussion experts. "Far fewer people are going to die from H1N1."</p>
<p>Dr. Tator also said that his research leads him to believe that as many as 20 per cent of the players on any hockey team (early teens to the NHL) suffer from concussion in a given season.</p>
<p>To be diagnosed with a concussion, a loss of consciousness is no longer necessary. Instead, any one of a long list of symptoms (dizziness, confusion, headaches, seeing stars or lights, nausea, etc.) after a blow to the head probably means a concussion. And symptoms aren't always immediate.</p>
<p>But even a blow to the head isn't required; it could be force applied to other parts of the body that causes the head to move in a whiplash-like manner.</p>
<p>Concussions are also no longer graded; they are gauged by the duration and severity of symptoms. And medical experts no longer like the term "mild concussion," because the word "mild" does not go well with brain injury.</p>
<p>In sports, the study of concussion has led to many discoveries.</p>
<p>One of the most important is the risk of second-impact syndrome, which can occur if there is a second concussion while a person still has symptoms from an earlier one.</p>
<p>In this case, there is high risk of brain-swelling and even death.</p>
<p>And that's why a protocol of careful steps has been developed for athletes to return to play after a concussion. Once symptom-free, they may gradually ramp up their activity, but always with at least a day in between the steps to make sure they are free from symptoms.</p>
<p>Experts are now also recommending that anyone with a concussion should not just sleep it off, but see a medical doctor.</p>
<p>All Jason Smith ever wanted for Christmas was hockey.</p>
<p>It became a family tradition -- and inside joke -- that there were always skates, sticks, gloves and tournament trips for him under their tree.</p>
<p>What he also got that he didn't ask for was a concussion.</p>
<p>As a draft pick of his hometown Calgary Flames in 1993, he was a big defenceman with an NHL dream and a future ahead of him, playing at Princeton University in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The first check to his head came during Flames' training camp in 1996, when an elbow knocked him cold. He described the sensation as large gates on either side, closing down his vision from the periphery to the centre with an echoing, whomping sound.</p>
<p>The second concussion came later that year during a game for the Flames' farm team in Saint John, N.B., a hit far less severe but with the same effect. He told nobody, though when he couldn't see, the team's assistant coach just told him to sit on the end of the bench.</p>
<p>A third occurred a short time later playing in the ECHL, from a routine shoulder check with very little force. Some symptoms went away more slowly, to the point where, "I had a Princeton degree and I couldn't hand-write a letter to my agent," Smith said of his "dark" days right after this third concussion in six months.</p>
<p>Nor could he count past 97 when asked to count by threes backward from 100.</p>
<p>He returned to Calgary to consult the Flames medical team and was told, in no uncertain language, that he should quit hockey for the sake of his brain.</p>
<p>He did not like the advice, given his lifelong Christmas list, but he followed it.</p>
<p>"I'm glad somebody was there to make that decision for me," Smith says.</p>
<p>Instead of continuing to put his brain at risk in hockey, Smith, the Princeton grad, became a successful sports orthopedic surgeon who has worked for such teams as the Washington Redskins, Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Blue Jays.</p>
<p>Concussion in hockey is pervasive and it's constantly ruining careers.</p>
<p>The risks of repeated concussions have only come into focus in recent years, and still much isn't known. But medical experts and researchers have seen evidence that depression, cognitive deficit, behaviour changes, epilepsy, dementia and even Alzheimer's disease could be in play.</p>
<p>Dementia pugilistica is a form of brain damage known to be suffered by boxers, but a similar condition, known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, has recently been seen in studies of football players. The condition, marked by unusual protein deposits in damaged areas of the brain, was also found in former NHL tough guy Reggie Fleming in a study released by a Boston University research team last summer. It was a finding that raised alarm in hockey medical circles.</p>
<p>The NHL has lost dozens of players to career-ending concussions.</p>
<p>Among the more prominent have been Keith Primeau, who will donate his brain to the Boston University study, Eric Lindros, Pat LaFontaine, Jeff Beukeboom and former U.S. Olympic goalie Mike Richter.</p>
<p>Manitoba Moose defenceman Michael Funk has suffered four concussions in the last 18 months, the most recent in early November. He's been finally having some better days recently, but is still experiencing symptoms, mainly headaches.</p>
<p>"Watching TV, I can tell within minutes if it's going to set one off," Funk says. "Then I'd have to back to my dark room and lay down." Funk's Moose season is over and he says this week he'll soon have some serious thinking to do about his hockey future.</p>
<p>Morden product Chay Genoway, the talented captain of the University of North Dakota Fighting Sioux men's team, was felled by a hit from behind that concussed him early in the season. It was a huge blow to his team and he hasn't skated since.</p>
<p>Winnipegger Jason Botterill, once a world junior hero, had his career cut short by concussion in 2004. He's now the assistant GM of the Pittsburgh Penguins.</p>
<p>And former University of Manitoba skater Stu Grimson's career ended too early in late 2001 while with the <span class="companylink">Nashville Predators</span>. After a stint with the NHLPA, he's now an attorney practising in the Nashville area.</p>
<p>tim.campbell@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>What is a concussion?</p>
<p>A concussion is a common form of brain injury, and can be caused by a direct or indirect hit to the head or body where the brain suddenly shifts or shakes inside the skull and can knock against the skull's bony surface. This causes a change in brain function, which results in a variety of symptoms. With a concussion there is no visible injury to the structure of the brain, meaning that tests like MRI or CT scans often appear normal.</p>
<p>(Source: ThinkFirst.ca)</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>(only one of these symptoms is required for a concussion diagnosis)</p>
<p>Nausea, vomiting</p>
<p>Dizziness</p>
<p>Confusion</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Light-headedness</p>

<p>In the age of irony, you'd think someone would have tried it by now.</p>
<p>A celebrity could walk the red carpet at the Oscars in a simple white sheath festooned with a thousand “cause” ribbons in every colour. Her bare arms could be ringed with kitschy silicone bracelets in candy hues.</p>
<p>“There isn't an earthquake or a disease or a societal issue that escapes my notice,” the actress could say sweetly to the TV interviewers. “I'm not just a vacuous celebrity who thinks only of herself.” Better yet, she wouldn't have to a say a thing. She could let her ribbons and bracelets do the talking.</p>
<p>But, oh yes, it would be a risk. A celebrity who sends up the cause trend? Image suicide. (Well, maybe shock comedian Kathy Griffin could pull it off.) Still, a little satire would come as welcome relief from the conspicuous compassion that grips the world. Sure, there's an anti-ribbon ribbon (black and yellow stripes, reportedly), but such sarcasm lives only in the dusty corners of the Internet. In celebrity circles, wearing a ribbon can still be an expected part of the formal social costume. At the recent Golden Globes, for example, the ribbon du jour was for Haitian earthquake relief.</p>
<p>Wearing a cause on one's frontage (or one's wrist) started out as a serious consciousness-raising tactic. “Ribbon-wearing was, originally, a gesture of defiance and protest, something relatively daring even,” says Sarah Moore, lecturer in the School of Sociology, Social Policy and Social Work at Queen's University in Belfast, and author of Ribbon Culture.</p>
<p>“When Jeremy Irons wore one at the Tony Awards in 1991, he was one of [only two] celebrities who did so, even though many had been sent the lapel pins by Visual AIDS.”</p>
<p>The cause bracelet obsession began in 1997, with cyclist and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong's yellow “Livestrong” bands. In 2005, after a boost from Oprah, 32 million people were wearing the bracelets, according to the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which sells them to fund educational programs. Other charitable foundations – and some private ones – have followed suit.</p>
<p>The klieg-lit self is a billboard, of course, which celebrities are happy to use – for a cause and perhaps some Harry Winston jewels. The red AIDS ribbon, when it first appeared, forced people to at least silently acknowledge a disease that was little understood at the time and highly stigmatized.</p>
<p>But for some observers, the integrity of cause ribbons quickly unravelled. By 1993, AIDS activists were complaining that the pin of red looped fabric was tokenistic, more an expression of guilt than compassion. Still, causes jumped on the fabric wagon.</p>
<p>“By the mid-1990s, we had ribbons of every hue and for many causes – including mouth cancer, autism, child abuse, self-harm, the Oklahoma bombings, violence against women and breast cancer,” Moore observes. “At some point in all this, the ribbon had become a fashion item, its capacity to make a meaningful statement of protest significantly weakened.”</p>
<p>Moore found that many people deliberated about wearing their ribbon based on whether it matched their outfit, and they were more inclined to remember the shop they bought it from than the charity it supported. And many knew “next to nothing” about the illnesses their ribbons represented.</p>
<p>Other observers, including Samantha King, an associate professor at Queen's University in Kingston and author of Pink Ribbons Inc., have examined how corporations' embrace of campaigns such as finding a cure for breast cancer have eclipsed prevention efforts.</p>
<p>A show of compassion, in other words, can be just that – a show, which has more to do with projecting an image about the wearer than it does with the cause. In Conspicuous Compassion, British author Patrick West writes that the trend is a symptom of what psychologist Oliver James called the “low serotonin” society.</p>
<p>“We are given to such displays of empathy because we want to be loved ourselves. Despite being healthier, richer and better off than in living memory, we are not happier,” West argues, citing the breakdown in traditional communities and the growing percentage of people who live alone. Ribbon-wearing is “about feeling good, not doing good,” he writes.</p>
<p>Still, isn't anything we wear a comment on self, a hopeful reflection of who we want to be? Irons's ribbon in 1991 made him seem progressive and, better yet for a celebrity, remembered – even now, close to 20 years later. Subverting the social costume is what individual style is all about, isn't it?</p>
<p>Everyone makes a statement every day, depending on what she or he puts on. David Butler-Jones, Chief Public Health Officer of Canada, wears leather jackets and Mickey Mouse watches. “I always figure it's nice to have something that doesn't quite fit,” he once told me. It shows self-confidence. He doesn't have to wear the suit of authority; he could inspire calm in the face of the H1N1 crisis by being it.</p>
<p>In her memoir Read My Pins, former U.S. secretary of state Madeleine Albright wrote about how she used pins – everything from family heirlooms to drugstore purchases – to telegraph the importance of a negotiation. Once, after being called “an unparalleled serpent” by one of Saddam's minions, she wore a snake pin when meeting Iraqi officials.</p>
<p>A fluttering cause ribbon dress at the Oscars would simply acknowledge the vanity of the exercise itself. And the satiric jab could make the point that perhaps it's time to move on from the compassion craze. Best of all, it would be entertaining and appropriately meta.</p>

</p>
<p>The frigid morning was still blanketed in darkness, but Nie Xiaojuan was awake and holding tightly her place in line. She had just spent her fifth straight night sleeping on the floor of Beijing Union College Hospital's registration hall, which was minutes away from its 6:30 a.m. opening.</p>
<p>Appointments for the best doctors are normally snapped up before sunrise. Lines begin forming in front of the hospital's six registration counters at least a day in advance. Nie's father, who was too weak to join the queue, needed to see several specialists. Nie had no choice but to stake out a place night after night so that each morning she could arrange a single appointment.</p>
<p>Around her hundreds of patients and family members filled the hall, a dimly lighted space about the size of a tennis court. Nie, who travelled 250 miles from Inner Mongolia by train, was lucky to be first in her line, boosting her odds of getting an appointment with one of the hospital's coveted medical experts. But even that was no guarantee. Patients with pull -- and plenty of cash -- don't bother with queues. Scalpers who line up as if they were patients or collude with shady registration clerks snatch up many of the slots and sell them to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>"The whole week we've been lining up," said Nie, 20. "What else can we do?"</p>
<p>At a time when the United States is grappling to overhaul its health-care system to provide more Americans with coverage, China is struggling with the fallout of abandoning its socialist model in favour of Western-style privatized medicine. Government efforts to modernize China's health-care system and reduce Beijing's role have led to deep funding cuts for public hospitals. Rural clinics have been hit especially hard.</p>
<p>The results are familiar to many Americans: Patients with good health insurance or ample savings can get first-class treatment at the best medical facilities, while millions of the uninsured and poor live in dread of a serious illness that could bankrupt their families. Hospitals are focusing ruthlessly on the bottom line to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Concerned that its rickety health-care system could destabilize social harmony, China's central government has launched a $124-billion overhaul, chiefly to improve service in rural areas. Failure to address the nation's health woes could be disastrous not only for China -- home to about a quarter of the globe's population -- but also for the rest of world because of the threat of rising communicable diseases such as H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"The issue in China is ultimately about access to health care," said Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at USC. "China, as a rising power, has to figure out how to care for its citizens."</p>
<p>Nie and her family live on the rural fringes of the provincial capital Hohhot, a popular tourist destination tucked between two mountain ranges in north-central China. Until last spring, life was ordinary for the most part. Nie's father was a truck driver and her mother a chef at a neighborhood restaurant. The family could live on its $350 monthly income.</p>
<p>Then, in April, Nie's father was seized with back pain. He could no longer drive. He started feeling lethargic and lost weight at an alarming rate. Nie took a job as a waitress at a restaurant to help make ends meet.</p>
<p>Six months later, doctors at a village clinic and county hospital were still stumped for a diagnosis. The family decided its only hope was to seek out experts in Beijing. Nie's father knew of Beijing Union and was convinced he would be cured there.</p>
<p>But as the health-care system has broken down in rural areas, peasants have flocked to the cities, overwhelming medical centres such as Beijing Union, where about half of the 8,000 patients seen there daily hail from other provinces.</p>
<p>It was first-come, first-serve, so Nie had to join the queue. Her father, wearing the same shabby pinstripe pants and blazer each day, could only muster the strength to stay with her in the afternoon. Nie was on her own at night. She bought foam tiles to sleep on.</p>
<p>The first day, she stayed at the hostel until the afternoon, then left for the hall, prepared to spend the night. She signed in with a guard for the department her father was seeking and grabbed a spot in the shortest line. She woke up in the morning, waited for her turn at the counter and took a white ticket printed out by the clerk's computer that granted her father an appointment with a bone doctor that same day. The next morning she secured an appointment with a pain specialist, then a heart physician. None knew what to do to help her father.</p>
<p>Nie and her father grew frustrated. The problem, they believed, was that they needed to see the hospital's chief neurologist -- one of the hardest appointments to secure. They figured their only hope was for Nie to get to the front of one of the lines.</p>
<p>At 6:30 a.m. the registration clerks removed their "No Service" signs and called people forward. Nie, her eyes puffy from lack of sleep, collected her things and approached the counter. She requested the neurologist and was given a white ticket by the clerk. She looked at the doctor's name on the appointment slip and sighed.</p>
<p>"This one was our third choice," she said, too exhausted to reject the appointment.</p>

</p>
<p>The chance of Alberta being hit hard by a third wave of H1N1 flu is melting away along with winter.</p>
<p>"We're not 100-per-cent sure we won't get some form of a third wave," said Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health. "It seems increasingly less likely at this point." The flu typically needs cold, dry weather to spread quickly, Corriveau said. It also tends to hit after people return from holidays over spring break.</p>
<p>"If we're going to see anything, it will be in the next few weeks."</p>
<p>There haven't been any recent flu outbreaks in North America, he said. Only a few sporadic cases have cropped up across the province, bringing the total number of people needing hospitalization since the first flu wave hit last April to 1,276.</p>
<p>In Alberta, 71 people have died after contracting the flu, but no one has died since Dec. 31.</p>
<p>Even the seasonal flu has kept a low profile, Corriveau said. "It's very unusual, but the winter's not completely over."</p>
<p>The scenario is far different than expected. Last fall, people crowded into hours-long lineups to be immunized and some became incensed when a vaccination shortage forced the Alberta government to temporarily close the lines to allow people at high risk of severe illness to get their shots first. Eventually, demand slowed and the vaccine supply sat idle. To date, one-third of Albertans -- about 1.3 million people -- have received H1N1 vaccinations.</p>
<p>"We had to take it seriously," Corriveau said. Health officials were dealing with a new pandemic and couldn't predict if the strain would mutate, leaving the vaccine useless. That didn't happen.</p>
<p>"I think we did everything that had to be done. ... H1N1 won't go away. It will probably be around for decades now."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health officer calls syphilis outbreak 'disturbing'</b>
</div><div>Jodie Sinnema   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>578 words</div><div>5 March 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Alberta had a record number of syphilis cases in 2009, and could yet see the tally rise as health officials continue their investigations.</p>
<p>While one infectious disease doctor called the statistics "profoundly disturbing" and an indictment on the government's lack of commitment to public health, the province's chief medical officer of health said syphilis is one of his priorities.</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's top public health doctor, said he's almost finished a report for Health Minister Gene Zwozdesky that will provide advice on how to stop the syphilis outbreak.</p>
<p>With 263 cases of the sexually transmitted disease confirmed in 2009 -- seven per cent more than in 2008 and a huge increase since 1996, when the province had no syphilis cases -- Alberta Health Services was originally expected to launch a new awareness and prevention campaign in March. The plans, which have yet to be finalized, were delayed while the province focused efforts on an aggressive fight against H1N1, Corriveau said.</p>
<p>In 2006, the province recorded 218 syphilis infections. In 2007, that jumped to 250, and in 2008, 245.</p>
<p>Twenty-two babies have been infected with syphilis since 2005, and eight have died.</p>
<p>In 2009 alone, six babies were born with congenital syphilis, three of whom died. If the disease is caught early, one shot of an antibiotic can cure it. Left untreated, it can cause brain damage and harm nerves, eyes, heart and other parts of the body.</p>
<p>"We want our syphilis rates to go back to zero," Corriveau said, adding it will likely take about five years to reach that goal.</p>
<p>Dr. Stan Houston, an infectious disease physician and professor at the University of Alberta, said there hasn't been clear leadership on the issue as Alberta Health and Wellness transfers the responsibility of sexually transmitted infections to Alberta Health Services. In 2008, four public health doctors, including a consultant on sexually transmitted diseases, left their jobs with the province. None have spoken about why.</p>
<p>"STI control is in a schemozzle," Houston said. "I think it should be very clear we've gone from the best to the worst."</p>
<p>According to a recent report by the Public Health Agency in Canada, eight out of every 100,000 Albertans were expected to have infectious syphilis in 2009. That's double the national average of 4.2 and second only to the Northwest Territories, where the projected 2009 infection rate was 161.7 of every 100,000. Many of those cases can be linked to Alberta, since there is an active travel corridor between Edmonton to Yellowknife.</p>
<p>"(Public citizens) have to decide whether they think (fighting and preventing syphilis) is more important than having some gold medal Olympians," Houston said.</p>
<p>"It depends where your priorities are, but quite frankly I think that's profoundly disturbing."</p>
<p>Both Houston and NDP Leader Brian Mason are calling on the government to launch a provincewide campaign, similar to one advocated for by Dr. Karen Grimsrud, a public health leader who warned government about the syphilis outbreak dating back to 2007.</p>
<p>When Ron Liepert was health minister, he narrowed the campaign to target high-risk groups, such as young single men working in Fort McMurray, pregnant women working in the sex trade in Edmonton's inner-city, and gay men in the Calgary area.</p>
<p>"I think they squelched the campaign because they found it embarrassing," Mason said.</p>

<p>With the release of the third-quarter financial report, Manitoba finds itself facing a $600-million deficit. Believe it or not, it could have been worse. The government has recently implemented a series of 'belt-tightening' measures such as restricting out-of-province travel, minimizing overtime and refraining from refurbishing office space.</p>
<p>But it also could have been a lot better. The government has been urged to reduce spending or at least restrain spending over the last decade; instead they increased it by over 70 per cent. They were told that those levels were unsustainable, but in response they would pull the what-hospital-are-you-going-to-close card. Now we can see what bunk that argument truly has been. The government is telling us that they have reduced spending in 14 sectors and departments without impacting front-line services.</p>
<p>It's funny how something that seemed impossible suddenly becomes possible. If they had simply reduced annual spending by one half of one per cent, we would effectively have no deficit today.</p>
<p>Imagine if the government can post a $600 million deficit when it's actually trying to "manage spending during these difficult economic times," how completely off the rails we would be if they had remained in 'let the good times roll' mode.</p>
<p>Manitobans should take Finance Minister Rosann Wowchuk's claims that they have reduced the anticipated deficit with a healthy pinch of salt. When we focus on the core government, the real shortfall remains unchanged at just over $600 million and yet somehow despite this massive deficit they still have the nerve to call it balanced. This of course has more to do with changing balanced budget legislation then balancing budgets.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting they continue their use of legislative loopholes to convince us that things aren't that bad. This time, they are excluding $90 million in expenditures related to the H1N1 flu when determining compliance with balanced budget legislation. It's not enough that they gutted the legislation to begin with, eliminating the need for annual balancing and replacing it with a four-year rolling average, but they have to pick at the carcass to see what else they can shake out in order to portray themselves as fiscal conservatives.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, a read of the report will show you one undeniable truth; overspending remains at the heart of this government's problems.</p>
<p>Now we are supposed to sympathize with the government because of the challenges ahead for them as the federal government attempts to balance its own books. Of course the minister of finance in her official press release says nothing about her government's complete failure to reduce our dependence on transfers from Ottawa.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, one should feel about as much compassion for this government complaining about federal cuts as you would for the alcoholic complaining that the bar is closed.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Fall surge shrinks provincial deficit forecast - Projected shortfall now $555 million, Wowchuk says</b>
</div><div>By Bruce Owen   </div>

</p>
<p>Manitoba's budget deficit won't be as bad as first thought.</p>
<p>But that's only a small comfort.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Rosann Wowchuk said Thursday the province's projected budget deficit for 2009-10 is now $555 million, down from the $592 million first forecast in the late fall. The new forecast is found in the province's third-quarter financial report and economic outlook.</p>
<p>The downgrading of the expected deficit -- the difference between what the government spends and what it takes in -- is a sign the economy improved a tiny bit in the last half of 2009.</p>
<p>"There's been some increases in some projections of some revenues that we weren't anticipating," Wowchuk said. "There is some activity and that's positive for us."</p>
<p>Wowchuk's budget for the coming year will be introduced March 23.</p>
<p>The opposition Progressive Conservatives said what hasn't changed in the size of the expected core deficit -- spending in departments the government controls, excluding Crown corporations. The forecast core deficit remains $602 million out of a core budget of about $10.3 billion.</p>
<p>Tory Leader Hugh McFadyen said the province could save $640 million by building <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>'s new $1.1-billion Bipole III transmission line down the east side of Lake Winnipeg instead of on the west side of the province.</p>
<p>An additional $350 million could be saved by backing off a controversial plan that requires the City of Winnipeg to remove nitrogen from its wastewater.</p>
<p>Driving the deficit are unexpected costs related to last fall's H1N1 flu fight and last spring's flooding.</p>
<p>The province spent $90 million on the H1N1 flu and $56 million on the flood fight. It also approved a special warrant totalling $304 million to fund various services such as income assistance, health care, child protection and justice.</p>
<p>There's also less revenue coming in.</p>
<p>The province expects to see an $88-million decrease in corporate income tax and $71 million less in federal transfers, mostly because of the timing of joint infrastructure projects. <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> profits are down due to lower industrial demand caused by the recession.</p>
<p>To make up the shortfall, Wowchuk has already asked civil servants and nurses to accept a two-year wage freeze and trimming discretionary spending, like hiring outside consultants. The government is also putting off filling some vacant positions.</p>
<p>One more positive note: Manitoba's population reached 1,226,196 on Oct. 1, an increase of 17,085 people since the previous year. That's the largest 12-month population gain since tracking began in 1971.</p>
<p>bruce.owen@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Manitoba's economic outlook</p>
<p>Manitoba's economy grew by 0.3 per cent in 2009, according to the provincial government. That's the strongest performance among provinces last year and much better than the national GDP decline of 2.3 per cent.</p>
<p>Manitoba's economy is expected to grow by 2.4 per cent this year, just below the forecast national increase of 2.6 per cent.</p>
<p>Manitoba lost part-time jobs in 2009, but that was offset by more full-time jobs.</p>
<p>In January, Manitoba's employment increased to 612,400 jobs, reaching an all-time high and surpassing the previous record set in August last year.</p>
<p>Average weekly earnings increased 2.8 per cent in 2009 from the year before. Nationally, average earnings increased 1.6 per cent.</p>
<p>Manitoba's retail sales dropped 0.9 per cent in 2009. The national drop was 3.0 per cent. New car dealers and gasoline stations had the largest declines. Stronger results came in the last two quarters.</p>
<p>Housing starts fell 25 per cent last year. Nationally, it was 29 per cent.</p>
<p>The stronger Canadian dollar and weak U.S. market contributed to a 10.9 per cent decrease in manufacturing sales.</p>
<p>Merchandise exports declined 18 per cent, led by lower nickel and copper exports.</p>
<p>The Consumer Price Increase rose 0.6 per cent in Manitoba and 0.3 per cent in Canada last year.</p>

<div>My Pharmacist</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Dispensing advice; People seek guidance at the pharmacy. Here are 15 of the most commonly asked questions people pose</b>
</div><div>KATHRYN GREENAWAY    </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>874 words</div><div>4 March 2010</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>C9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>Pharmacists these days are on the front line of health care - often the first health professionals people seek out for guidance.</p>
<p>"They don't want to go and sit for hours in a clinic or emergency room, so they come to us with questions," pharmacist Marc Rabbat said. "We do a sort of triage with them. We're not trained to diagnose diseases, but we're trained to look for certain symptoms."</p>
<p>Rabbat has been a pharmacist for 10 years. He is currently working at the Uniprix Pierre Gravel pharmacy at Plaza Pointe Claire.</p>
<p>Joelle Wizman has been a pharmacist for 25 years. She works at the Jean Coutu pharmacy on Monkland Avenue in Notre Dame de Grace.</p>
<p>"Some people don't have a family doctor, so they come to us for advice," Wizman said. "If they just have a cold, we can give them some guidance before they start to panic and then go clog the emergency rooms."</p>
<p>Rabbat and Wizman have fielded thousands of questions over the years. It's tough to whittle that many questions down to a manageable number, but here is their list of 15 popular questions.</p>
<p>Queries often reflect the season or the particular demographic the pharmacy serves.</p>
<p>1. Which cough medicine works best?</p>
<p>"Quite possibly the top question during the winter," Rabbat said.</p>
<p>2. I feel like I have the flu. Do I have H1N1?</p>
<p>"When we were in the middle of the H1N1 season, it was scary," Rabbat said. "People were panicking. Even if they just had a little sniffle, they thought they had H1N1."</p>
<p>3. What do I do to stop my baby's cough?</p>
<p>"Cough medicine doesn't help babies," Wizman said. "That's why cough medicines are now recommended for children six years old and older."</p>
<p>"We suggest increasing the humidity in the room or using a bit of (a menthol) rub," Rabbat said.</p>
<p>4. What do I give my baby for teething pain?</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, there is no magic cure," Wizman said.</p>
<p>5. What do I use for my eye infection?</p>
<p>"We can recommend mild, over-the-counter antibiotic cremes," Rabbat said. "But if there is pain and trouble with vision, we tell them to go see their doctor."</p>
<p>6. Is this medicine covered by health insurance? (Of particular concern to senior citizens.)</p>
<p>"They ask, 'Why did I pay that much the first time and now I'm paying this much?" Rabbat said. "We give them the government information number or tell them to call their private insurance company."</p>
<p>"We don't like those questions," Wizman said. "It takes up a lot of time, and every insurance policy is different."</p>
<p>7. What do I take for constipation?</p>
<p>"This is a popular question for senior women," Rabbat said. "If they are taking pain killers combined with other medications, they often get constipated."</p>
<p>8. What do I take for arthritis?</p>
<p>"The best thing to take is an anti-inflammatory, but things get complicated if the person is taking blood thinners or has heart problems," Rabbat said.</p>
<p>9. What is the best allergy medicine?</p>
<p>"Quite possibly the top question during the spring and summer," Rabbat said.</p>
<p>10. How do I treat mosquito bites?</p>
<p>"Take allergy pills," Rabbat said. "A mosquito bite is an allergic reaction."</p>
<p>11. What do I do if I miss taking my birth control pill?</p>
<p>"If someone has forgotten to take one pill, they should take two pills the next day," Rabbat said. "But if more than one day has been missed we have to consider the length of time and the point the woman is in her cycle when the pills were missed."</p>
<p>12. What stop-smoking aids work best?</p>
<p>"Regulations recently changed, so we can now prescribe stop-smoking aids," Wizman said. "If a smoker is told to go to the doctor for a prescription, they often put it off for months. We speed up the process."</p>
<p>13. Can I drink alcohol with this?</p>
<p>"Most often people are asking if they can drink while taking antibiotics, especially around the holidays" Rabbat said. "It's a misconception that you can't drink while taking antibiotics. Perhaps you shouldn't drink because you are sick, but there are only a couple of antibiotics out there that should not be mixed with alcohol."</p>
<p>14. Will this herbal remedy cure me?</p>
<p>"People come in with the latest herbal remedy being advertised on television or radio. It's almost like the flavour of the month," Rabbat said. "They like to think it will be the miracle cure. We often don't have a lot of information on the herbal remedy."</p>
<p>15. Do I need to take vitamin D, calcium, omega 3?</p>
<p>"More and more people are asking about these particular vitamin supplements," Wizman said. "There is a lot of learning on the job that goes on for pharmacists. We have to stay up to date, so we attend various seminars during the year."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>WestJet voices optimism on economic recovery</b>
</div><div>Chuck Chiang   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald; with files from the Financial Post</div>
<div>603 words</div><div>4 March 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Calgary-based <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. said its load factor held steady in February, with the 82.5 per cent figure practically unchanged from the 82.6 per cent for the same period last year, while voicing optimism about an economic recovery.</p>
<p>The airline also reported a growth of nine per cent in revenue seat miles, which meant an additional 68,000 passengers flew with the carrier last month compared with February 2009.</p>
<p>"We are extremely pleased with our strong February load factor given our increased capacity and a nine per cent improvement in RPMs (revenue passenger miles)," WestJet president and CEO Sean Durfy said in a statement.</p>
<p>"While our first quarter is traditionally a weaker period for domestic travel, directing the majority of new capacity towards our international expansion is allowing us to partially offset this seasonality," he said.</p>
<p>"We are seeing continual demand for our growing number of popular vacation destinations, demonstrating the ongoing benefit of our seasonal deployment strategy."</p>
<p>WestJet -- which reported its 19th straight profitable quarter in the fourth quarter of 2009, but also saw earnings slide 64 per cent during that period -- said it expects business to continue to be affected. The airline is expecting revenue per available seat mile to drop by just below three per cent in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
<p>WestJet had previously attributed the profit slide to various events that hampered flyers' desire to travel, including the H1N1 scare and increased security requirements for U.S.-bound passengers.</p>
<p>"We are cautiously optimistic," said WestJet vice-president of culture and communications Richard Bartrem. "Certainly, you can see the signs, like our January load numbers, which was a record for us for that month. With the February numbers, it certainly seems to indicate the economy is recovering."</p>
<p>According to a report from <span class="companylink">UBS</span> Investment Research, WestJet's February load numbers were in line with analyst expectations.</p>
<p>But the report also raised doubt as to whether WestJet can achieve this year the nine per cent quarter-to-quarter improvement in revenue per available seat mile the airline usually sees in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Overall, however, <span class="companylink">UBS</span> agreed with WestJet that demand may be beginning to rebound.</p>
<p>"While we believe an improvement of this magnitude (nine per cent in the second quarter) may be difficult to achieve . . . given significant industry capacity, we expect to see a (year-to-year) improvement in the high single digits," the <span class="companylink">UBS</span> report said.</p>
<p>Bartrem said the airline also saw a boost from the Olympics held in Vancouver over the past two weeks.</p>
<p>WestJet added a number of flights to the city, Bartrem said, but noted the impact of those added flights "were not necessarily seen" when placed in the context of the airline's system overall.</p>
<p>The Vancouver airport, boosted by the Games, saw its busiest day on record on March 1 -- the day after the Games ended -- with roughly 39,000 passengers passing through the facility that day.</p>
<p>Air Canada, meanwhile, reported Wednesday evening it had a load factor of 78.4 per cent last month, down from 79.6 per cent a year earlier. It said it had a 7.1 per cent increase in capacity combined with a 5.5 per cent rise in traffic.</p>
<p>Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu said in a statement he was "pleased" with the results.</p>

Durfy says the airline's moves to direct new capacity toward
international routes is allowing it to offset the seasonality of
domestic flights.   </p>

</div><div>Paula Simons   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>1048 words</div><div>4 March 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>There's a killer loose in Alberta. A serial killer, who maims adults, but kills babies. This stealthy stalker preys on newborns -- and has brought about the deaths of eight infants in the last five years.</p>
<p>This killer isn't nameless. It's just that we in Alberta don't like to say the name out loud: Syphilis.</p>
<p>You may have thought syphilis was something we'd consigned to the history books, the sexually transmitted disease we'd conquered with antibiotics and strong public-health initiatives. And up until a few years ago, you'd have been right.</p>
<p>In 1996, there wasn't one reported case of syphilis in this whole province. In 2002, there were 17.</p>
<p>By February 2007, public health officials were warning of a major outbreak. That year alone, Alberta registered 250 diagnosed cases of syphilis, including five congenital cases in newborn babies. Four died. By then, syphilis had already spread from high-risk groups, such a sex-trade workers, into the general population, infecting teens younger than 15 and seniors as old as 86.</p>
<p>Three years on, things have gone from bad to worse.</p>
<p>Alberta reached a bleak high-water mark in 2009: a record-setting 264 new cases of syphilis reported, up eight per cent from 2008.</p>
<p>Among those were six cases of congenital syphilis. Half of all the babies infected died. The Public Health Agency of Canada now estimates eight out of every 100,000 Albertans has infectious syphilis, double the national average.</p>
<p>Back in 2007, the province had the chance to launch a major public awareness campaign, to warn people, especially those with high-risk lifestyles, about the dangers of this resurrected and virulent sexually transmitted disease.</p>
<p>Public health officials had prepared just such a campaign. But then-health minister Ron Liepert personally cancelled the initiative, arguing that 95 per cent of Albertans were unaffected by the disease, and that Albertans with high-risk lifestyles had to take more responsibility for their own sexual health, and not expect the general population to take care of them.</p>
<p>Some six months after Liepert scrapped the campaign, Alberta Health Services did finally roll out a stripped-down PR initiative, targeting designated high-risk groups, including sex-trade workers in Edmonton, single men in Fort McMurray and Calgary's gay community. It also changed medical protocols, to require physicians to screen pregnant women for syphilis three times during the course of a pregnancy.</p>
<p>But the rising number of syphilis cases, and syphilis-related deaths, suggests those strategies aren't getting the job done.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services was supposed to roll out a new syphilis awareness and prevention campaign this month. But those plans were derailed when public health officials diverted their attention to fighting the H1N1 flu virus. The campaign never got off the drawing board.</p>
<p>Andre Corriveau, appointed last spring as Alberta's chief medical officer of health, is currently working on a new provincial syphilis strategy, which bodes well, since in his previous role as chief medical officer for the Northwest Territories he took a much more proactive approach to fighting the disease there. Corriveau says he intends to make the syphilis issue a personal priority.</p>
<p>"Obviously, as we look at our stats for 2009, we haven't been doing enough yet," he says. "We need to step up to the plate."</p>
<p>It's bad enough that syphilis is infecting certain at-risk groups, including gay men and aboriginals, at disproportionately high rates. But the other concern is that syphilis has infiltrated the community at large. According to Alberta Health and Wellness, 20 per cent of infected men reported having intercourse with sex-trader workers, while 28 per cent of infected women said they were involved in the sex trade. In other words, 80 per cent of infected men reported no contact with prostitutes, while 72 per cent of infected women said they had no involvement with the sex trade.</p>
<p>This isn't an "us/them" disease -- it's infecting college students and married mommies, teens, seniors and babies, men and women, gay and straight. Syphilis doesn't care about age, race, orientation, class or religion. If you have unprotected sex with anyone -- including a long-term partner whose fidelity you can't guarantee -- you could be at risk.</p>
<p>We need a scientific, modern approach to fighting this ancient foe, one that finally puts common sense and epidemiological principles ahead of sermons and moralizing self-righteousness.</p>
<p>We need to protect the most vulnerable -- and stem the spread of the disease in the general population at the same time -- not just with ads, but with more public health resources. After three years of burying our heads in the sand, it's time to acknowledge we're in the midst of a real public health crisis. Here's hoping Gene Zwozdesky, our new health minister, musters the courage and the realism to let health workers fight syphilis effectively. The longer we wait, the harder the job becomes.</p>

<p>SYPHILIS FACTS</p>
<p>- -Syphilis is called "the great imitator" because of the wide range of symptoms people can experience.</p>
<p>- -In primary syphilis, a painless open sore appears at the site where the bacteria first entered the body, usually the genital area, throat or anus.</p>
<p>- -Symptoms can occur within weeks or months of infection. Since ulcers are painless, people may not know they've been infected. While sores may go away without treatment, the infection remains and progresses to secondary syphilis.</p>
<p>- -In secondary syphilis, symptoms can include patchy hair loss; a rash on the soles of the feet, the palms of the hands or elsewhere on the body, fever, swollen glands, and muscle and joint pain. These symptoms often disappear without treatment.</p>
<p>- -Syphilis is most infectious during the primary, secondary and early latent stages. It is when it becomes a tertiary infection that it can be the most dangerous, doing damage to the brain, blood vessels, heart and bones.</p>
<p>- -People infected with syphilis may show few or no symptoms at all, which is why it is important for those in high-risk groups to be tested for the disease.</p>

<p>At least once a day, I wonder if the stuff in my house is killing my son.</p>
<p>I tell myself I'm being unnecessarily anxious.</p>
<p>But the authors of a new book would say I'm not.</p>
<p>Canadian researchers and environmentalists Rick Smith and Bruce Lourie's book Slow Death by Rubber Duck: The Secret Dangers of Everyday Things (Counterpoint) is the result of a series of human experiments that show how quickly exposure to harmful chemicals can raise levels in our bodies.</p>
<p>"This notion that there's such a thing as a safe level just simply doesn't exist for endocrine-disrupting chemicals," Lourie said. "There is no safe level. Zero is safe, everything above zero is less safe."</p>
<p>From the baby wash I rub on my baby's body each night, to the canned tomatoes in my homemade pasta sauce to his well-worn teddy bear, they're all suspects, all potential hazards and carriers of Bisphenol-A (BPA) or phthalates or lead.</p>
<p>Other books have been written about the danger in everyday things. In this case, the two researchers took revealing those dangers into their own bodies.</p>
<p>While holed up in a condo, they exposed themselves to seven common chemicals that researchers have linked to disease and defects.</p>
<p>They used deodorant and shampoo known to contain phthalates, which have been linked to hormone disruptions. They drank out of baby bottles made with BPA and ate food from cans lined in BPA, reheated in microwaveable BPA-filled containers. They ate mercury-heavy tuna.</p>
<p>With each chemical, they tried to mimic the exposure people have in everyday life. Before and after using the products, they tested their blood and urine. After just two days of regular exposure, in almost each case, the numbers went up.</p>
<p>BPA levels went up seven and a half times. For phthalates, normal exposure upped levels 22 times. With seven tuna snacks or meals, levels tripled.</p>
<p>With two days of using anti-bacterial products from non-alcohol-based hand-sanitizer to toothpaste, triclosan levels went up 2,900 times. Triclosan, a registered pesticide, has been linked to thyroid issues and cancer.</p>
<p>"You've got to think as a population, in the wake of swine flu, that our population exposure to this chemical would be hugely increased," Smith said. "This is a chemical that the American Medical Association is actually suggesting should not be used at home. ... Hand-washing is all people need."</p>
<p>We should all worry, but parents and expectant mothers especially. Children stick their hands and toys in their mouths. They crawl on the floor, breathing in more dust. Children's bodies are still developing.</p>
<p>"At very, very low levels -- we're talking parts per billions -- these chemicals can mimic hormones in your body and alter genes as they're forming," Smith said. "The huge range of childhood epidemics like autism, ADHD, obesity, asthma and childhood cancers, these are all being linked to the levels of toxic chemicals that are around us in the environment."</p>
<p>Right now parents can educate themselves. Watch for recalls, research which companies practise safe standards and look for products free of toxins. Wash your children's hands with regular soap. Keep their toys out of their mouths.</p>
<p>"If you're careful about what you buy and you focus on a few key chemicals, it's actually pretty easy these days to choose this brand over that brand," Smith said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Freedom or oppression?; A Quebec Human Rights Commission case about whether a woman wearing a niqab should be allowed to attend French classes has ignited passions on both sides, writes Marian Scott.</b>
</div><div>Marian Scott   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>824 words</div><div>4 March 2010</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Should a woman wearing a face-covering niqab be allowed to attend French classes for new immigrants?</p>
<p>A case before the Quebec Human Rights Commission has re-ignited the never-far-from-the-surface debate over reasonable accommodation of minorities in Quebec.</p>
<p>In November, the government ordered an Egyptian immigrant to uncover her face if she wanted to continue taking a government-sponsored French class at a Montreal college. The woman, a permanent resident of Canada, refused and lodged a complaint with the rights commission.</p>
<p>The case has stirred up passions on both sides of the issue.</p>
<p>"I think this is an illustration of when an accommodation becomes unreasonable," civil-rights lawyer Julius Grey said.</p>
<p>While members of minorities should be allowed to wear religious garments such as a hijab (Muslim head scarf), a niqab -- a square of fabric worn over the face with a slit for the eyes -- interferes with language teaching, Grey said.</p>
<p>"A kirpan, a kippa, a kerchief, is reasonable. This goes too far," he said. (A kirpan is a ceremonial sword worn by Sikhs, while a kippa is a Jewish skullcap.)</p>
<p>"It is important for the teacher to see the student's mouth to teach good elocution. A niqab interferes with that objective," said Luc Fortin, a spokesman for provincial Immigration Minister Yolande James.</p>
<p>"We cannot allow the learning environment to be compromised," he added.</p>
<p>But Salam Elmenyawi, president of the Muslim Council of Montreal, slammed the decision to expel the woman as discriminatory.</p>
<p>"To deny a person the chance of integration, just because they follow what they believe is correct for them, is wrong," he said.</p>
<p>By meddling in the case, the government has fanned anti-immigrant sentiment, Elmenyawi charged. "It's this idea of manufacturing cases of hysteria over reasonable accommodation."</p>
<p>He contended the case could have been solved quietly through negotiation.</p>
<p>The case shows that simmering passions over the accommodation of cultural and religious minorities have not been laid to rest since the Bouchard-Taylor commission, which held hearings across the province in 2007. Its 2008 report called for an official policy on Quebec as a secular society, more funding for diversity programs and better training for institutions on handling cultural minorities.</p>
<p>Some Muslim women view the niqab as a cloak of invisibility that protects their modesty, but for many non-Muslims, it is a highly visible symbol of the oppression of women.</p>
<p>At the Muslim Student Association of Concordia University, where head scarves are de rigueur for many undergrads, students wondered why the woman could not have been accommodated.</p>
<p>"There's this misunderstanding that if you cover your face you cannot interact with society," said Asma Qureshi, 24, a first-year recreation therapy student. But Qureshi pointed out that a face covering need not be an obstacle to communication.</p>
<p>For instance, surgeons wear face masks, as did many people during last year's H1N1 scare.</p>
<p>"As long as you're not imposing it on others, isn't it their choice?" she asked.</p>
<p>Fortin said Immigration Department officials did their best to accommodate the needs of the woman, who began language classes at the end of August and was expelled at the beginning of November. She initially agreed to remove her niqab when meeting with a female student adviser and when posing for her school ID card. She also agreed to receive some instruction without the niqab from a female teacher in an isolated area of the school.</p>
<p>The teacher allowed her to give an oral presentation at the back of the classroom, facing away from other students. However, the student complained that some male students could see her face and asked that they be moved to a different part of the classroom.</p>
<p>Her demands created a tense atmosphere and caused problems at the school, Fortin said.</p>
<p>In 2007, Quebec's chief electoral officer backed down on a controversial decision to allow women wearing a niqab to vote.</p>
<p>Later that year, Canada's chief electoral officer refused to force Muslim women who wear a niqab or burka to remove their veils to vote.</p>
<p>Morton Weinfeld, chair in Canadian ethnic studies at McGill University, said it will be up to the courts to rule on the issue.</p>
<p>"My personal view as a citizen is that there are always going to be limits to the amount of reasonable accommodation we can have. This may be a reasonable limit."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Seasonal flu a no-show; It usually kills 1,500 a year in Ontario, but this year, not one death. Health experts weigh in</b>
</div><div>Theresa Boyle   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>748 words</div><div>4 March 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A02</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Infection control experts are scratching their heads and wondering what happened to the regular seasonal flu in North America.</p>
<p>Ontario typically sees 1,500 deaths associated with seasonal flu annually. This year it has seen none.</p>
<p>"There is nothing. There is no influenza at all right now except for a smattering of cases here and there," said Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious disease control and prevention with the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion. "It's not at all clear where it's gone," he added.</p>
<p>The lull comes after public health officials were accused by the province's former chief medical officer of health in December of fear-mongering over the extent of the H1N1 outbreak. Dr. Richard Schabas, now medical officer of health in Prince Edward and Hastings counties, noted at the time that the number of Canadians visiting doctors with flu-like symptoms peaked in late October.</p>
<p>This time of year is typically "high season" for seasonal flu, noted Dr. Kathleen Dooling, associate medical officer of health for Peel.</p>
<p>"Compared to the fall of 2009, things are extremely quiet with respect to influenza, and in comparison to past influenza seasons, things are very quiet," she added.</p>
<p>Indeed, the province saw only one confirmed case of seasonal flu in the last week alone.</p>
<p>While influenza bugs have been under the microscope for decades, there is still much that is unknown about them.</p>
<p>"It's quite remarkable how little we know about it, despite having looked at it and worried about it," Gardam said. "We are not even sure how it's transmitted person-to-person."</p>
<p>Theories about what has happened to seasonal flu this year abound. Has it been knocked out by the pandemic virus? Perhaps it is part of a cycle that sees influenza bugs lie low once a decade? Maybe all the extra vigilance over handwashing has kept it at bay. How about the mild winter?</p>
<p>"I can't give you an explanation why, when H1N1 showed up, all the others vanished. We know that happens from other pandemics. When a new strain comes in, it tends to replace the other strains, but I can't easily explain to you why that is," Gardam said.</p>
<p>Dr. Allison McGeer, head of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital, agreed it is possible that the old seasonal strains of Influenza A - H3N2 and another subtype of H1N1 - are being replaced by the pandemic H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"But this doesn't explain influenza B," she said, referring to the third strain that makes up seasonal flu.</p>
<p>She also pointed out that seasonal flu is currently circulating in China.</p>
<p>"If you look at North America, it looks like seasonal flu is being replaced, but there is actually a fair amount of H3N2 activity in China," she said.</p>
<p>There is much speculation that next year's seasonal flu will be made up of the pandemic H1N1 virus and influenza B virus.</p>
<p>But McGeer said it is impossible to predict with certainty because our experience with pandemics is so limited.</p>
<p>Because influenza viruses are so unpredictable, McGeer said she wouldn't put money on betting what has happened to this year's seasonal flu.</p>
<p>"Before every year, you don't know how much activity there is going to be and you don't know what the predominant strain is going to be," she explained.</p>
<p>"On this list of possibilities is that it's going to be a really quiet year and there is not going to be much of anything. Once every 10 years, that's what happens," she said, noting that the last quiet flu season was in the winter of 2000-01.</p>
<p>Another theory floating around is that public campaigns urging people to wash their hands regularly and sneeze into their sleeves has stymied seasonal flu. But there is no evidence to back that one up.</p>
<p>Though Schabas had no explanation for the quiet season, he doesn't buy the theory that the mild winter is responsible.</p>
<p>"If it were true we would expect influenza transmission to be consistently worse the further north you go. But it isn't," he said.</p>

</div><div>Andrew Mayeda   </div>

</p>
<p>The federal government is expected to rack up $179.4 million in unforeseen costs to plan and prepare security for this summer's G8 and G20 summits, newly tabled documents reveal.</p>
<p>Canada was originally just supposed to host one meeting this summer, of the G8 leaders in the cottage-country town of Huntsville, Ont., north of Toronto.</p>
<p>But the federal government decided to expand the summit to include the G20 countries after it became clear that organization had become the dominant forum for dealing with the financial crisis and other economic issues.</p>
<p>The G20 summit will be held June 26-27 at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, a stone's throw from the CN Tower. The G8 summit will still be held in Huntsville before the larger G20 event.</p>
<p>The RCMP, which is co-ordinating the security effort, will receive the biggest chunk of the extraordinary funding: $131.7 million.</p>
<p>The Public Safety department will receive $32.1 million, the Department of National Defence $11.7 million, and Industry Canada $2.7 million.</p>
<p>The budget breakdown confirms that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service will be involved, although the spy agency will receive only $597,000.</p>
<p>The money will be used to: "design, plan and co-ordinate security operations for the summits; provide the RCMP and its security partners with temporary accommodation facilities for the G8 summit; procure information technology and portable communication assets; work with federal, provincial and municipal security partners responsible for providing summit security; and ensure the safe keeping of all international protected persons attending the summits."</p>
<p>Last week, Toronto city council voted to demand that the federal government post a bond for any extraordinary expenses.</p>
<p>Councillor Adam Vaughan, who represents the ward where the G20 summit will be held, has lobbied for the summit to be moved to Exhibition Place, which is slightly removed from the downtown core.</p>
<p>The supplementary estimates also earmark $176.1 million for Canada's response to the earthquake in Haiti, including costs associated with the government's contribution to an earthquake relief fund and deployment of troops to the disaster zone.</p>
<p>Other expenses include $86.6 million for "mitigation and response activities related to the second wave of the H1N1 influenza pandemic," $110 million for Candu reactor refurbishment projects, and $72 million to repair the Chalk River nuclear-isotope reactor.</p>
<p>An unforeseen $83.6 million has also been allocated for policing and security at the Vancouver Olympics and Paralympic Winter Games.</p>

<p>With their new head coach behind the bench for the first time, the Olympiques shut down the Val-d'Or Foreurs almost completely on the way to a 2-1 victory in a Quebec Major Junior Hockey League game at the <span class="companylink">Air Creebec</span> Centre in Val-d'Or.</p>
<p>Christian Ouellet-Martel's power-play goal early in the third period proved to be the winner as the Olympiques improved their regular-season record to 27-30-5.</p>
<p>Mitchell Porowski, also on the power play, had scored for Gatineau late in the second period to tie the game 1-1.</p>
<p>Anthony Taylor scored the only goal for the Foreurs (22-35-7), who directed just 16 shots at Olympiques netminder Maxime Clermont.</p>
<p>Val-d'Or goaltender Jacob Gervais-Chouinard faced 29 shots.</p>
<p>The game had originally been scheduled for Nov. 23, but was postponed after a number of Foreurs contracted H1N1.</p>
<p>Chabot was hired as Olympiques head coach on Monday, two days after the team announced Jérôme Dupont's resignation, which itself came the morning after Gatineau ended an eight-game losing streak with a 2-1 shootout victory against the Montreal Junior.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Potash industry to get refund; Sask. to record negative number in potash revenue</b>
</div><div>Angela Hall   </div>
<div>Saskatchewan News Network; Regina Leader-Post</div>
<div>679 words</div><div>3 March 2010</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan Party government must refund millions of dollars to potash companies that overpaid royalties to public coffers, Finance Minister Rod Gantefoer says.</p>
<p>That pushes the budget's once-positive $1.9-billion projection for the pink mineral into unprecedented red territory, according to the third-quarter 2009-10 budget update released Tuesday. For the first time ever, the province will record a negative number -- minus $203.9 million -- in potash revenue.</p>
<p>"It's been a pretty consistent story in terms of (potash revenue) getting worse than we thought almost every single month of the year," Gantefoer told reporters.</p>
<p>"It's encouraging, though, to see that there are sales being negotiated," he said, citing recent deals between Saskatchewan potash producers and China and India. "It's good to see potash cars on the tracks again, see potash trains working."</p>
<p>However, the lack of any potash revenue in this budget year is huge turnaround from the initial $1.9-billion projection made last spring, when the government anticipated it would get 20 per cent of its revenue from potash royalties. With sales virtually non-existent in the first part of the year, that projection was downgraded to just $109 million at mid-year.</p>
<p>But even that estimate proved to be too optimistic. Gantefoer said the potash projection is now negative because of instalment payments potash producers made a year ago, as required, based on estimates of their calendar year profits. The government pocketed the money at the end of its 2008-09 budget. But as the current budget year unfolded, it became obvious the potash corporations had significantly overpaid and the money must be refunded, Gantefoer said.</p>
<p>The government said it can't provide a specific dollar amount of what's being refunded to the potash industry, due to confidentiality rules in the Mineral Taxation Act. But the amount will exceed potash revenues collected this budget year by $203.9 million.</p>
<p>The latest adjustment to the potash forecast drew fire from the provincial NDP. Finance critic MLA Trent Wotherspoon said the government was "ludicrous" with its potash projections from Day 1.</p>
<p>"Many kids get their hand caught in the cookie jar and all of a sudden a lot of honesty comes out. I think this is pretty telling," Wotherspoon said.</p>
<p>The government said the good news from the third-quarter report is that revenue is $153.8 million higher than the mid-year projection, despite the potash woes, largely due to increases in oil and tax revenues.</p>
<p>Expenses are anticipated to be $99.6 million higher than the mid-year projection, but are down $133.1 million from the spring budget. Health spending is up $67.7 million from mid-year in part due to H1N1 preparedness. Expenses at Municipal Affairs are up $56.9 million, due to spending under the Building Canada Fund and Municipal Infrastructure Grants programs.</p>
<p>The government has a projected operational deficit of $85.6 million, and will transfer $510.1 million from the growth and financial security fund to the general revenue fund.</p>
<p>The growth and financial security fund, often referred to as the rainy day fund, is projected to have a year-end balance of $705 million, up $54.2 million from the mid-year forecast.</p>
<p>Gantefoer said the summary financial deficit -- which includes all aspects of government such as the Crown sector -- has improved to about $800 million for 2009-10, compared to the $1-billion summary deficit projection at mid-year. The province's next budget will be delivered later this month.</p>
<p>"We're going to do what we said in terms of trying to be very prudent and cautious on the revenue numbers on the volatile commodities," Gantefoer said.</p>
<p>"But you still have to make an estimate as to what these revenues are going to be because non-renewable resources are such an important part of the province's economy. You can't simply ignore them entirely."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>New rules for visitors</b>
</div><div>Pamela Cowan   </div>
<div>Leader-Post</div>
<div>494 words</div><div>3 March 2010</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>The Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region is delivering new rules for maternity patients and newborns at the Regina General Hospital.</p>
<p>The new visitor rules for the mother-baby unit are unrestricted visiting hours for a spouse/partner and a support person designated by the mother. Siblings and grandparents can visit between 11 a.m. and 8 p.m.</p>
<p>On the labour and birth unit, a spouse/partner and support person designated by the mother can remain throughout labour and delivery. Following the birth, grandparents and siblings accompanied by a spouse/partner, support person or grandparent can briefly visit.</p>
<p>The new rules let mothers have time to adjust to life with newborns, said Sharon Garratt, the region's executive director of Women's and Children's Health.</p>
<p>"When you're in your home, you have a choice," Garratt said. "You cannot answer the phone, you cannot answer the door. You're in control of that situation. When you're on an inpatient unit, if somebody comes to the door, they've made that choice to come and see you. It's pretty hard to say to them -- after they've driven here, found a parking spot and come up to the unit -- 'Please leave!' "</p>
<p>During the past four months, visiting was restricted to protect newborns and pregnant women from the H1N1 virus. Many families and staff members said they appreciated the limit on visitors to the unit.</p>
<p>"Mothers and babies have a number of adjustments to make in the very short time they have with us in hospital -- which is about 24 to 48 hours for most women," Garratt said.</p>
<p>During that brief time, new mothers and babies face a steep learning curve.</p>
<p>"Moms are learning to feed babies and babies are learning to eat, breathe and regulate temperature on their own," Garratt said.</p>
<p>Aggie Uleryk, a registered nurse on the mother-baby unit, said nursing staff can teach more effectively about breastfeeding, bathing the baby, caring for the cord, recognizing illness and taking an infant's temperature when fewer people are around.</p>
<p>"When we had no restrictions, we really had very limited time to get through that teaching, so moms were going home not informed of everything," Uleryk said.</p>
<p>Before H1N1 restrictions started, some mothers had up to 12 visitors at one time.</p>
<p>On average, there are 30 mothers on the mother-baby unit. Some have single rooms; others share with two or more mothers. Babies stay with mothers unless the babies are in the neonatal intensive care unit or the nursery for observation.</p>
<p>When the H1N1 restrictions were in place, children couldn't visit. But some parents protested.</p>
<p>Before visiting was limited by the H1N1 pandemic, there were set visiting hours but no visitor restrictions.</p>

<p>Buffy Sainte-Marie</p>
<p>When: March 23</p>
<p>Born a Piapot Cree in Saskatchewan, then orphaned and adopted by a white family, the folk-music giant and legendary activist would suffer being blacklisted for her political views ( "I was put out of business in the United States," she says) but has blithely carried on with her career -- in 2008 she released Running for the Drum and in 2009 was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Cloris Leachman</p>
<p>When: April 20</p>
<p>A beauty pageant winner who started acting on Broadway, Leachman first grabbed our</p>
<p>attention with her Oscar win in The Last Picture Show ( 1971). Then came the genius of her many comedic creations: among many others, Phyllis Lindstrom on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, scare-the-horses Frau Blucher in the Mel Brooks classic Young Frankenstein and, most recently, the grandmother from hell on Malcolm in the Middle.</p>
<p>Charmaine Crooks</p>
<p>When: May 4</p>
<p>The Jamaican-born athlete brought gold back to her adopted country of Canada from the Pan American and Commonwealth Games, and silver in the 4x400 metre relay from the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. In 1996 she proudly carried the flag for Canada at the opening ceremony of the Atlanta Olympics. In addition to her many duties with the Canadian Olympic Committee, Crooks is also a founder and board member for Right to Play, an athlete-driven movement to bring sports to youth in disadvantaged areas.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Olympic celebrations boosted visits to ERs; Surge of drunk revellers and tourists was highest at Vancouver General Hospital, where number of patients rivalled swine flu's peak</b>
</div><div>Pamela Fayerman   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>712 words</div><div>2 March 2010</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Emergency departments at Vancouver hospitals treated hundreds more patients than expected during the Olympics. And booze and other mind-bending substances were a dominant factor.</p>
<p>Public intoxication and visits from out-of-province or out-of-country visitors are both linked to the increase in visits to emergency departments during the Games, Dr. Patricia Daly, chief medical health officer of the Vancouver Coastal health region, said Monday.</p>
<p>Hospitals in Vancouver treated 140 assault victims during the Games, compared to a normal level of about 90. More than 80 per cent of the assault victims were males.</p>
<p>Vancouver General, St. Paul's, Mount St. Joseph and Lions Gate hospitals all saw hundreds more emergency room patients during the Olympics than their historical average over the past three years, according to a Vancouver Coastal Health report. Other hospitals in the region, such as Richmond General, UBC and Squamish, had no Games-related increase.</p>
<p>VGH and St. Paul's saw 423 emergency room visits during the Olympics that were related to alcohol or other substances, compared to 278 during a normal two-week period. The number of patients aged 15 to 24 who went to the ER tripled; most were suffering the effects of intoxication such as overdoses or injuries sustained in falls and fights.</p>
<p>These statistics will be passed on to London 2012 and Sochi 2014 Games organizers to use in their planning.</p>
<p>Daly said Vancouver's mild weather, compared to most Winter Games cities, brought more people downtown and into celebration venues, and many of them engaged in festive drinking.</p>
<p>Daly said International Olympic Committee officials commented on the fact that unusually large crowds gathered in downtown Vancouver. The downtown area was the location of several Olympic venues, public celebration sites, and many national pavilions, bars and clubs.</p>
<p>St. Paul's alone saw several hundred more emergency patients during the Olympics than usual. As the designated spectator hospital, it got the most out-of-country and out-of-province visitors. Lions Gate and Mount St. Joseph hospitals also treated more emergency patients. But the greatest surge came at VGH, which saw as many patients during the Olympics as it did last November when swine flu was peaking.</p>
<p>"While each Olympic site has to plan for their own unique circumstances, these are all things we will want to share and document in our knowledge translation report," Daly said in an interview, adding that while celebration sites contributed to high and infectious spirits among spectators, the dark side is that some of the people who drank too much ended up in hospital.</p>
<p>She said the "Olympics impact" on hospitals was a little surprising since previous Winter Games hosts had reported no extra impact on hospitals and some reported much less emergency traffic.</p>
<p>Dr. Bruce Campana, an emergency doctor at VGH, said there were days during the Olympics when people he saw in the waiting room at the start of his eight-hour shift were still sitting there at the end of his shift, not yet treated.</p>
<p>"Before the Games, we were told, 'Don't worry, it will be quiet, just like it was at previous Games.' Instead, we got the opposite and that was on top of already high volumes. You can only suck it up so much.'"</p>
<p>Daly did not deny Campana's contention that VGH has been consistently experiencing higher emergency room patient volumes over the past few years, largely due to an aging population in Vancouver.</p>
<p>The frustration drove 21 of about 30 emergency doctors at VGH to sign a letter to The Vancouver Sun in February drawing attention to the fact that they are continually seeing "overwhelming numbers" of patients.</p>
<p>"We have been told by our administration that we are allowed to call in an extra emergency physician for a limited number of hours, but only during the Olympics," the letter stated.</p>
<p>Daly said the good news is that most of the emergency visits during the Olympics were minor in nature and fewer of the visits resulted in hospital admission than usual.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Time to let the good times roll; New coach Chabot advises Olympiques to 'have fun'</b>
</div><div>Darren Desaulniers   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>984 words</div><div>2 March 2010</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Early</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, and that is the fact that John Chabot is here for a good time; that's just the way he does things. Whether he's here for a long time is still up in the air.</p>
<p>Early Monday morning, Chabot was hired as the third head coach of the Gatineau Olympiques in less than two years, less than two days after the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League club announced the resignation of Jérôme Dupont.</p>
<p>Olympiques general manager Charlie Henry met Chabot at the Ottawa airport as Sunday turned into Monday following Chabot's flight home from Winnipeg, where he had served as an Olympic hockey analyst for APTN. The deal was done before the sun came up, and just hours later Chabot was on the ice at the Robert Guertin Arena, running his first practice as head coach.</p>
<p>His appointment is for the remaining seven games of the regular season and the playoffs. Anything beyond this season is up in the air.</p>
<p>"They have to like you and you have to like (the situation). There's no use tying yourself to something if it's not a good fit," said Chabot, who lives in Ottawa with his wife Terry, an artist. He has two children, Aubrey and Kyle, who are law and pre-med students at McGill University in Montreal, and another daughter, Alexandra, is an English literature student at Queen's University in Kingston.</p>
<p>"I had no interest in going anywhere else. I wasn't going to go to another part of the country to coach," Chabot said, adding he would have taken a similar role with the Ontario Hockey League's Ottawa 67's or Kingston Frontenacs, but added there was "no chance" that was going to happen.</p>
<p>Chabot is no stranger to the Olympiques. He has known Henry for 35 years, played for the team between 1979 and '81 and was an assistant coach to Benoît Groulx for four seasons ending in 2005.</p>
<p>He was the head coach of the QMJHL's Acadie-Bathurst Titan for a little more than a year and an assistant with the National Hockey League's New York Islanders for two seasons.</p>
<p>During his own career, he also played 508 NHL games with the Montreal Canadiens, Pittsburgh Penguins and Detroit Red Wings.</p>
<p>Although he admits to having little direct knowledge of the 2009-10 Olympiques, who are third in the QMJHL's Telus Western Division with a 26-30-5 record, he does know the league and has used his contacts to educate himself.</p>
<p>"I don't know what happened before I got here, and I really don't care, truthfully," Chabot said. "I'm here now and I don't know much about the team, but I've talked to coaches around the league I know, and there were a lot of positives about the team and the possibilities. I've got two guys (assistant coaches Guy Lalonde and Guy Desjardins) that have been here all year who are going to help me out immensely, and I'll be depending on them quite a bit."</p>
<p>After Monday's practice, his message to Olympiques players was clear.</p>
<p>"Have fun and start enjoying the game for what it's worth," he said. "You can control your work ethic and your mental approach, but you can't control a lot of things, so don't even try."</p>
<p>Chabot, born in Summerside, P.E.I., is an Algonquin from Kitigan Zibi and does a lot of work with native youths. For the past 18 months, he and others have been working on an educational-sport proposal that has garnered a lot of interest.</p>
<p>"It has got to get a foothold somewhere, and we think we're very close to getting that," he said. "That is something that is very important to me, more than anything I'm doing right now. If that thing takes off, it's something I can see myself doing for the rest of my life."</p>
<p>The proposal involves getting northern youths back into school, using sports as an entrance, and keeping them there.</p>
<p>Chabot says it's important that steps are taken towards improving the situation. For at least the next two weeks, though, he's committed to getting the Olympiques, who have lost nine of their past 10 games, back on track, and that suits the players just fine.</p>
<p>"We're going to have to work hard," captain Hubert Labrie said. "I think the practice sessions will be short and intense.</p>
<p>"The timing is good. It's positive, and we can only look forward and forget what's happen to this point. I think we needed a change because the morale was really down."</p>
<p>Forward/defenceman Josh Domingues said he and most Olympiques players had only meant Chabot once before Monday, but the new coach already had their respect.</p>
<p>"Anyone who has been in the NHL as a player and a coach, you have to respect them," Domingues said. "Especially as a coach, that shows that he knows hockey and that he's a good person because to get to the top level you have to be personable and be a good person because if people don't like you they're not going to give the opportunity."</p>
<p>The Chabot era begins tonight in Val-d'Or, where the Olympiques will play a game postponed in November after some of the Foreurs contracted H1N1.</p>
<p>Following another road game against the Montreal Junior on Thursday, the Olympiques play host to the Quebec Remparts on Friday at the Guertin Arena at 7:30 p.m.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Fighting anti-Semitic hatred, in all its forms</b>
</div><div>Frank Dimant    </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>733 words</div><div>2 March 2010</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 National Post . All Rights Reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>In a recent editorial ( "One size doesn't fit all," Feb. 25), the National Post concluded its attack on the integrity of our League for Human Rights' annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents by stating that our organization, B'nai Brith Canada, should "update [our] mandate and methods to reflect the tolerant Canadian reality" instead of "scaring Jews into thinking that they are living in a state of anti-Semitic siege."</p>
<p>This "recommendation" in itself provides an insight into the Post's misunderstanding of the purpose and mandate of our audit --a document which in its essence is a report on the trends of Canadian anti-Semitism, not a value judgment of the society in which we live. We can all agree that Canada is a wonderful place in which to live and one of the best places on earth to be a Jew. However, Jews still too frequently find themselves the victims of anti-Semitism on our streets and on our university campuses.</p>
<p>The acts of anti-Semitism in the Audit of Antisemitic Incidents are based on incidents reported to us through our Anti-Hate Hotline, our online reporting mechanisms and on incidents we receive through our community partnerships, including with law enforcement agencies across the country. Considerable resources are then dedicated to verifying each and every incident before they are included in our audit, while, at the same time, ongoing support is provided to the victims. It is not up to us to increase or decrease the number of reported incidents -- we just report the facts as they are made known to us.</p>
<p>In fact, law enforcement experts and researchers estimate that only 10% of victims of hate crimes ever come forward to report their victimization. In light of that reality, we consider it a crucial aspect of our mandate to create greater public awareness of the issue in the hope that people who find themselves the victims of anti-Semitism are not cowed into silence.</p>
<p>As for the "seriousness" of the incidents included in the audit, the incident definition framework used in the report is the same as that used by organizations all over the world. In the 28 years that the audit has been released, its data have been reviewed and incorporated by institutions such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the U.S. State Department and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.</p>
<p>To suggest that incidents such as a "blog posting blaming Jews for the H1N1 pandemic" or young boys "caught passing anti-Semitic notes at school" are "entirely trivial," as the Post does, is irresponsible. We are sure that anyone who has ever found themselves on the receiving end of a frantic phone call from a Jewish mother reaching out for help because her young children are being tormented at school because they are Jewish will attest to the fact that this is indeed a very serious incident of anti-Semitism. Who are we, or the Post for that matter, to judge between the seriousness of anti-Semitic taunting in the schoolyard or a cemetery desecration? Who is the Post to decide that bullying of a child is more trivial than graffiti on a tombstone?</p>
<p>Every incident in the audit is Canadian in nature and has a direct effect on the lives of Jews in this country. To suggest that B'nai Brith scours cyberspace for anti-Semitic material to include in our Audit is absurd. Yes, anti-Semitic taunts over <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> with a Canadian connection are included because social networking sites are the new pen and paper of a whole generation. That is the way people communicate nowadays. But this reality in no way negates the existence of anti-Semitism in Canada or the credibility of our audit.</p>
<p>For over 135 years, B'nai Brith Canada has proudly served the needs of Canadians in combating bigotry and racism. And for 135 years, we have witnessed and fought against anti-Semitism in Canada. While Canada has become a much more tolerant place than it used to, we still have a job to do and, whether the National Post agrees or not, we consider it our mandate to continue that mission so that Canada becomes a better place for all Canadians.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Time out works in Harper's favour; Despite prorogation, survey finds Conservative support has risen to 37%; Ignatieff sees dramatic drop in leadership poll, falling behind Layton</b>
</div><div>John Ivison   </div>

</p>
<p>Jean Chretien proved to be the real star of the show at the glitzy Black and White Opera Soiree in Ottawa last Saturday. The former prime minister was in his element, regaling his fellow diners with old war stories, most of which revolved around his favourite subject --himself.</p>
<p>The anecdotes were self-serving but dripping with pearls of political wisdom garnered from a 40-year career in politics -- not least of which was his observation that his greatest single attribute was his experience.</p>
<p>Voters can instinctively smell inexperience, like salmon sniffing out the fresh water where they were spawned. This may explain why Canadians don't think that Michael Ignatieff -- a political veteran of just four years --has the qualities necessary to be prime minister.</p>
<p>A new Ipsos Reid poll for Canwest News Service makes grim reading for the Liberal leader. Not only has the political time out offered by the Olympics worked in favour of the Conservative party, the data suggest that voters don't think Mr. Ignatieff has what it takes to lead Canada.</p>
<p>The absence of bad political news over the past two weeks because of the blanket Olympic coverage in the media has clearly cooled the anger many Canadians felt over what they saw as an unnecessary prorogation of Parliament. But, having registered their protest, the poll suggests voters are now focused on the course the country should take as it emerges from recession.</p>
<p>The Conservative were the main beneficiaries of this shift, with support rising three points to 37% since last month, compared with a two-point fall for the Liberals, who were down to 29%. The NDP were down one point to 16%, while the Greens were also down one point at 7%.</p>
<p>Mr. Ignatieff said yesterday he doesn't think the anger with the Prime Minister has gone away but it is a fair bet that after this week's Throne Speech and budget, prorogation will become as dormant an issue as H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>The more worrying prospect for the Liberal leader is the Ipsos poll's finding that he is considered the third most qualified national leader, trailing not only Stephen Harper but also NDP leader Jack Layton, in every category of leadership attributes studied.</p>
<p>Nearly half of Canadians (46%) believe Mr. Harper would make the best prime minister, an increase of three points since this question was last asked a year ago. Mr. Layton rose 10 points, with one in three Canadians (33%) believing he would make the best prime minister, while Mr. Ignatieff recorded a dramatic drop of 12 points since last year, with only one in five voters believing he is the best man for the job.</p>
<p>Ipsos asked a number of questions about trust and competence and in each Mr. Harper outpolled the Liberal leader two to one. Prorogation and the Afghan detainee issue have taken their toll -- with four in 10 saying their impression of the Prime Minister has worsened over the past three months. But Canadians still trust that the Conservative leader is the man best placed to lead the country through tough economic times-- Mr. Harper was judged best qualified by 46% of respondents, Mr. Layton by 26% and Mr. Ignatieff by 24%.</p>
<p>The Liberal leader's new aides are trying to repackage their man and focus his message on bread-and-butter issues like youth unemployment, rather than on subjects he might have debated while he was a human rights professor at Harvard.</p>
<p>But it may be that Canadians have already decided en masse that Mr. Ignatieff just doesn't have what it takes -- like the old Peter Cook sketch One Leg Too Few, in which a one-legged man applies for the job of Tarzan, "a job for which two legs would appear to be the minimum requirement."</p>
<p>As Mr. Chretien noted, good judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment. Mr. Ignatieff has certainly made enough mistakes but he may not be given enough time to learn from them.</p>

Black & White Photo: Hans Deryk, Reuters / The flattering backdrop of the Olympics provided differing political platforms for the nation's leaders. As prime minister, Stephen Harper had the benefit of
good company, cheering on the Canadian women's hockey team with hockey legend Wayne Gretzky in the photo. The two also sat together at the men's gold medal game on Sunday.

Black & White Photo: CTV, Torontoist.Com / Meanwhile, NDP leader Jack Layton, bottom photo, partially obscured in the centre, had to make do with taking in the game at Wayne Gretzky's restaurant in
Toronto. That appearance caused a buzz over whether Layton moved the arm of someone in front of him so that he could be better seen. More on Letters, Page A17.

</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Local emergency departments have been extra busy, although there's no explanation for the surge in patients.</p>
<p>Normally, both St. Mary's and Cambridge Memorial Hospital have about 125 patients in the emergency room in a day. But since about the middle of February, they've at times topped 150 - an increase of 20 per cent.</p>
<p>Grand River Hospital typically sees about 165 patients a day, but spiked to 201 about a week ago.</p>
<p>"Usually when there's an increase like this, you can attribute it to something," said Don Shilton, vice-president of patient services at St. Mary's General Hospital.</p>
<p>The flu season, for instance, always drives up emergency room visits.</p>
<p>But right now, hospitals are seeing almost the same number of visits as they did last fall when patients flooded local emergency departments at the height of the H1N1 flu virus outbreak.</p>
<p>No single health problem seems to be behind the spike in emergency visits over the past week-and-a-half.</p>
<p>"There's nothing in particular that seems to be driving it," Shilton said. "It's just the volume that's strange."</p>
<p>There's just a little bit more of everything, from minor injuries and stomach bugs to serious health problems requiring admission. Many coming to the hospitals are quite ill.</p>
<p>"It's just kind of odd," said Cambridge Memorial's patient services director Rita Sharratt.</p>
<p>"It just seems everything is touched."</p>
<p>The Cambridge Urgent Care Centre - which saw about 3,000 patients a month, most without a family doctor - closed on Tuesday. The closure is not necessarily behind the recent spikes in patient visits at Cambridge Memorial, but Sharratt said the hospital definitely expects to be busier as more people turn to the emergency department for care.</p>
<p>Ambulance visits and admissions are up at St. Mary's, too. Usually ambulances come to the hospital between 14 and 16 times a day, compared to 18 in recent days. The average 10 admissions a day jumped to 15 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Shilton said strategies put in place in the past year to reduce wait times are helping the hospital cope with the influx of patients. Strategies include a establishing a minor treatment area in emergency for less acute patients and streamlining patient discharge on the in-patient floors to free up beds.</p>
<p>Last year on average 41 per cent of patients were admitted within the hospital's eight-hour goal. On Tuesday despite the surge in admissions, 57 per cent met that goal.</p>
<p>Grand River Hospital has focused on reducing the number of patients in hospital who are no longer acutely ill and waiting for care in the community, such as in a long-term care facility or home services. Having fewer alternate level of care patients filling beds means the hospital is also in better shape during busy days.</p>
<p>"It does give us a bit of capacity to deal with a surge when we get it," executive officer Malcolm Maxwell said.</p>

</p>
<p>a-dope worked once upon a time for Muhammad Ali.</p>
<p>It worked for the Gatineau Olympiques on Friday night, too.</p>
<p>Mired in an eight-game losing streak, the Olympiques put a priority on defence against the Montreal Junior, and it eventually paid off in a slump-breaking 2-1 shootout victory in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League game at the Robert Guerin Arena.</p>
<p>Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored the only goal of the shootout on Gatineau's eighth attempt, while netminder Maxime Clermont foiled all eight shots he faced to give the Olympiques (26-29-5) a much-needed victory.</p>
<p>The Junior (28-26-6) opened the scoring early in the second period. A defensive-zone breakdown by the Olympiques -- rare on this night -- and a moderately fortunate bounce left the puck on the stick of an open Louis-Marc Aubry, and his quick snap shot got past Clermont, who had no chance on the play.</p>
<p>Clermont, the league leader in minutes played, was the much busier of the two goaltenders. He faced 39 in regulation and overtime, stopping all but the one by Aubry and keeping his struggling team in the contest.</p>
<p>His teammates seemed to be doing more thinking about X's and O's than playing for the longest time, which was why there were few threats to the shutout bid of Montreal's Jean-François Berubé until Olympique defenceman Adam Janosik poked one by him with a little more than two minutes remaining in the third period.</p>
<p>Berubé faced just 20 shots in regulation and overtime.</p>
<p>Gatineau was 0-for-2 on the power play, including one opportunity during overtime, while Montreal was 0-for-4 while playing with the man advantage.</p>
<p>The Olympiques are back in action tonight, but on the road against the Drummondville Voltigeurs. They're in Val-d'Or on Tuesday to play a game originally scheduled for late November, but rescheduled because some of the Foreurs contracted H1N1.</p>
<p>Gatineau plays a return match against the Junior in Montreal on Thursday.</p>

</p>
<p>At the onset of flu season, Ottawans braced to meet the H1N1 pandemic head-on. Late last summer, Bruce Deachman asked the city's front-line workers how they were planning to meet the challenge in the face of growing uncertainties.</p>
<p>This week, as world health experts debated the status of the pandemic, we went back to those individuals to see how they fared Eleanor Sutherland Family doctor What she said then: H1N1, I think it's something like ...</p>
<p>I was involved years ago with the big polio epidemic, and you never knew who was going to get it. They would walk in one day and be dead the next. It was a very horrible, scary thing, that one.</p>
<p>What she says now: I thought that a tremendous effort went into to getting the most susceptible people immunized. It required an enormous amount of organization, from getting the vaccine to getting the staff to man the clinics and getting the volunteers to help out with the clinics. It's impossible to say how many lives were saved, but we do know it was a severe outbreak, and the immunization prevented further damage.</p>
<p>Peter Schonenbach Monsignor St-Joseph Church, Orléans Then: As for H1N1, like anything, we have to be sure we don't exaggerate it, but on the other hand it's obviously something that reminds us how important life is. That's part of the Christian message: Stay alive, be thankful for what you have and keep it in good shape.</p>
<p>Now: It is gratifying that the flu epidemic feared seems to have passed without too dire consequences. Certainly the campaign encouraging immunization helped a great deal, and I believe the experience has had lasting effects. More people are conscious that hands that have not been thoroughly washed may bring grief when brought in proximity of nose and eyes.</p>
<p>Here in my parish, people now understand that the gesture of peace that is called forth during the celebration of the Mass may be a smile, eye contact or a hand gesture and need not be a handshake.</p>
<p>The flu campaign brought home the point that prevention of sickness is everyone's business.</p>
<p>Terry MacIver Executive director The <span class="companylink">Children's Place</span> child-care centres Then: We're very limited in what we can do, because if the health department calls for us to close, we will need to close. Our biggest goal with regard to closure is to ensure we don't have to close entirely. We're going to be concentrating on essential services, and because we operate the 24-hour, seven-day-a-week centre, many of our families actually work in essential services in medical services, as ambulance drivers, in seniors' homes.</p>
<p>Now: I believe that had there not been a blitz on to make the public aware -- what some call a "lot of hullabaloo about nothing" -- there would have been a lot more of something.</p>
<p>I know from the results of the public communication campaign our child-care programs suffered a lower outbreak rate in all aspects of flus during the "outbreak" caution than previous years and that it is directly related to families with children carrying on the "hand washing" at home and in other venues outside of our daycare.</p>
<p>We had 18-month-olds automatically going to the hand sink to wash, due to the consistency of all adults in their lives (not just at child care) talking and showing them they needed to wash their hands after routine elements of their activities.</p>
<p>Zijad Delic Imam and executive director Canadian Islamic Congress Then: With any disaster, I think religious communities should do several things. They should focus on mobilizing the community and educating the community about the possible impact, as well as how to defend ourselves, if possible, and use all precautions and means to help ourselves be defended.</p>
<p>Now: The first thing that comes to my mind after the H1N1 season is over is that life is the most important commodity we enjoy and that each moment needs to be used efficiently and properly taken care of. For a majority of us, only when we lose our health do we start to appreciate this blessing.</p>
<p>So the mere thought on consequences of H1N1 has made many Canadians very conscious and careful as far as their health is concerned. And that is good! I think we know how to be responsible individuals.</p>
<p>I have also utilized the timing to speak to the Muslim community about the importance of health and taking care of oneself, hygiene as well as environment in which we live. People easier get the message when they can relate to the topic.</p>
<p>The duty of every conscious believer or/and a citizen is to realize that the business of prevention of any sort of infection is an ethical, social and religious duty. The message of Islam then is: Seize the opportunity of times when you are healthy before you become sick! Certainly, prevention is much easier and less expensive then treatment ... especially these days.</p>
<p>Claudia McKeen Pharmacist and owner Glebe Apothecary Then: Our role as pharmacists is to teach infection control and remind people of the basics if they have it and how to prevent the spread of it. I think we have to prepare for the worst and be ready.</p>
<p>Now: At the pharmacy we were indeed prepared. November was a very exhausting month for most pharmacists in this city. We were inundated with questions from concerned parents, doctors' offices and emergency rooms. The questions vetted ranged from "Can you make Tamiflu suspension?" to "Will you stay open and wait for me to get to your pharmacy, I am coming from CHEO with a prescription for Tamiflu!" To our surprise many stores sold out of cough and cold remedies. There were four days in this city that one could not purchase a thermometer. Our stores were sold out and our wholesalers were sold out. It was a buying frenzy of flu remedies. We sold record amounts of hand sanitizers and nasal irrigation solutions. Pharmacists rallied and were there for the public because they were needed. I don't want to brag, but I think as a profession we really shone and were a key element in the dissemination of information to the public and in making sure that the public got what they needed. We had a big part in calming people down and trying to steer them away from hospitals, stay home and try to use common sense to ride out the symptoms.</p>
<p>Janice Woods Paramedic Ottawa Paramedic Service Then: I don't think H1N1 is going to change the way we operate because we, as paramedics, are exposed to contagious diseases all the time. It's part of our job.</p>
<p>Now: I am proud to have been part of a group of people who worked together to get through this pandemic. It was definitely a team effort amongst all healthcare professionals, and the public as well.</p>
<p>Speaking as a paramedic, I saw first-hand how our service's protocols, in place for many years now, worked extremely well to prevent the spread of H1N1. From the illness screening tool used by our medical dispatchers, to our service issued personal protective equipment, we kept ourselves and our patients safe throughout this trying time in our city.</p>
<p>Sean Copeland Funeral director Whelan Funeral Home Then: I'm not worried about transmission here from the deceased; the virus has pretty much petered out once the death takes place -- it's the people who have been with that person who are possibly contagious. And what is a funeral but a gathering of friends and family.</p>
<p>Now: I think the way the public, our government and the media have approached the potential outbreak has changed the fabric of our society. It has made every Canadian or our fellow citizens of the world take responsibility in how we live our everyday lives in a health-conscious manner. From washing one's hands, the way we prepare and handle our food, the types of activities one participates in and how we expose ourselves and our families. I thank God for my children's health and still smile when my five-year-old reminds me he needs to use the hand sanitizer before returning from playtime with his friends.</p>
<p>Isra Levy Medical Officer of Health City of Ottawa Then: We anticipated a second wave, worse than the first. We knew that most people would experience mild disease, but some would be severely ill. We had seen that Ottawa's residents had heeded advice about hand hygiene and avoiding others when ill. We had seen that the community cared, and people wanted to protect themselves and their children. But we did not know whether the vaccine would arrive in time to head off a second wave, nor whether people, in large numbers, would be interested in obtaining it.</p>
<p>Now: We have seen that Ottawans have an extraordinary commitment to protecting themselves, their families and friends and heeding advice as to how best to do that. We have seen that people can be kind, patient, tolerant and helpful when waiting for others to modify their plans. We have confirmed that residents in this community, community agencies, the city of Ottawa, and the nurses, public health inspectors, epidemiologists, nutritionists and other staff at Ottawa Public Health are resilient, adaptable and tenacious in meeting and handling unpredictable challenges.</p>
<p>Diane Deans Chair of Ottawa's Community and Protective Services Committee Ottawa Then: On Sept. 23, I delivered the first of several H1N1 updates.</p>
<p>At that time, I told my colleagues, "We are as prepared as we can be." But I don't think I fully appreciated the enormity of the task ahead.</p>
<p>There were many unknowns, including if there would be a second wave of the illness, how much vaccine the city would receive, when we would receive it, what operational instructions would be imposed upon the city and the mood of our residents toward receiving a vaccine that had not gone through all of the traditional clinical trials and approvals. Now: The first days were extremely challenging and were not without public criticism, but the city proved itself to be adaptable and flexible and ultimately succeeded in vaccinating 53 per cent of the population. We learned that pandemics and other emergency situations are unpredictable and require an organization that is malleable and able to adapt to changing circumstances. Every day had its challenges resulting in changes and further changes in delivery of the vaccine.</p>
<p>We learned that Ottawans took on the task of protecting themselves and their loved ones. They coughed into their sleeves, washed and sanitized their hands thoroughly and were immunized in large numbers. Sadly, we saw the death of local residents and that was an important reminder of our overall effort and our resolve to meet the challenge of the disease. We learned that residents and the city employees can work together for the health of the city.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>What have we learned from H1N1?; After 'pandemania,' a post-mortem on our response to swine flu</b>
</div><div>Ian MacLeod   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1197 words</div><div>27 February 2010</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Was H1N1 another Y2K?</p>
<p>The pandemic microbe so underwhelmed an anxious world that the World Health Organization issued an extraordinary statement recently to deny it manufactured a fake flu crisis in collusion with vaccine-makers.</p>
<p>"The world is going through a real pandemic," Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the agency's top flu expert, told the Council of Europe's health committee, where the allegation surfaced. "The description of it as a fake is wrong and irresponsible."</p>
<p>Evidence shows WHO acted in good faith declaring the top Level 6 pandemic last June. The new and seemingly highly virulent pathogen surfaced in Mexico in April, killing nearly half of those who became critically sick.</p>
<p>As it began to circle the globe, it caused a striking and unusual pattern of severe illness and deaths in younger people, with many caused by viral pneumonia, an especially aggressive form of pneumonia.</p>
<p>Humanity braced for germ warfare.</p>
<p>Then swine flu fizzled.</p>
<p>H1N1 was a deflagration, not a detonation, a pandemic, not a plague.</p>
<p>Two waves, from April through November, killed 426 in Canada, including 11 in Ottawa. More than 16,000 have died in more than 212 countries so far. Tragic, but not a planetary catastrophe. Seasonal flu and pneumonia killed almost 8,000 Canadians in 2007-2008. (Experts caution the H1N1 mortality total is not comparable due to methodological differences between the two sets of data.)</p>
<p>This week, WHO's emergency committee advised it's still too early to declare the worst over, that too many uncertainties are still in play.</p>
<p>A potential third wave could arrive this year, but the post-mortem is already underway.</p>
<p>The Big Pharma conspiracy levelled at WHO is perhaps an extreme reaction to the flu's anti-climax.</p>
<p>But was all the vaccinating, hand-sanitizing and elbow-sneezing really necessary? Or did the measures succeed in restraining the virus and save countless others from slowly suffocating to death?</p>
<p>Swine H1N1 was the first time international science and health professionals were able to rapidly detect, identify and track an influenza pandemic in real-time through WHO's network of influenza laboratories in 101 countries and national surveillance, such as Canada's FluWatch network of sentinel physicians.</p>
<p>Moreover, Canada and many other countries had elaborate pandemic plans calling for mass immunizations. By the time WHO declared the pandemic June 11, Canada had already made arrangements with drugmaker <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> to begin producing vaccines for fall delivery.</p>
<p>Did all the 21st-century scientific and surveillance capacity and government preparation and planning dictate the outcome, despite evidence H1N1 was milder than first feared?</p>
<p>Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief medical officer of health, believes so. Rigid adherence to pre-existing pandemic plans fuelled what he calls "pandemania.</p>
<p>"Once a pandemic was declared, there was no turning back," he wrote recently in a commentary with Neil Rau, an infectious diseases specialist and medical microbiologist. "On WHO instructions, all countries dutifully activated their pandemic plans.</p>
<p>"It was once said that no plan survives the first five minutes of any battle. What this means, of course, is that any plan can be quickly superseded by events. The good public health leader, like the good general, needs to put more value on utilizing new information and less on simply following orders. This is the real lesson of H1N1."</p>
<p>When compared to the typical flu and pneumonia in 2007-08, the proportion of hospitalized H1N1 patients requiring intensive care was 50-per-cent higher, according to a new study by the Canadian Institute for Health Information.</p>
<p>H1N1 hit younger age groups especially hard compared to influenza/</p>
<p>pneumonia patients in a typical flu year. The median age for patients hospitalized with H1N1 was 28, while the median age for influenza/pneumonia was 71. The early 50s was median age of people with H1N1 who died, compared to the early 80s for people who died with influenza/</p>
<p>pneumonia.</p>
<p>Earl Brown, a University of Ottawa virologist and executive-director of the school's Emerging Pathogens Research Centre, says swine H1N1 presented a real dilemma.</p>
<p>"It's going all over the place, it's spreading in the summer, it's not flu season ... the ICUs are getting filled with healthy, middle-aged people and teenagers. Things are not normal. So how much do you respond to this? Should we just say, 'Gee, funny summer, a blip in flu?'"</p>
<p>A misunderstanding of the initial outbreak in Mexico didn't help, he says. Only later did officials realize many more people than originally thought had been infected, skewing the epidemiological data and the virus's perceived virulence.</p>
<p>"We looked at the tip of the iceberg, but there was a really big base, there were a lot of people infected," explains Brown.</p>
<p>"We know that there's a lot of stuff we don't know. I think this pandemic shows us a lot of things we think we know are shaky, too. I think maybe a little more humility in the biology-virology field ... We've got to figure out some of these basics a bit better so we're not just blowing smoke and waving our arms when something like this goes on. We've got to get a better handle on what's happening in this natural system and an appropriate response."</p>
<p>Though Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's medical officer of health and the city's pandemic pointman, acknowledges all the pre-planning and capacity did perhaps influence the outcome, he says, "I'm not unduly concerned that it took us in an inappropriate direction.</p>
<p>"We are constantly striving to find the sweet spot between inappropriate complacency and unnecessary anxiety and that space has served me well," he says. "We'll never be able to really judge whether we hit that sweet spot because there's no randomized controlled trial, so to speak, on that subject."</p>
<p>Pandemics come and go, but this one was unprecedented because science and technology allowed real-time scientific discovery, policy development and public health intervention and implementation. It was, says Levy, both a phenomenal opportunity and challenge.</p>
<p>Good communications with the public and good faith decision-making were crucial, not only for this virus but for future public health episodes and emergencies.</p>
<p>"My concern as a local public health practioner has always been that we should retain the public trust and confidence because then the public will be willing to engage in a conversation with us the next time around. I hope that we've achieved that.</p>
<p>"People understood the difference between the fact that this was a novel virus that could cause very, very many illnesses of which a small proportion would be severe, as opposed to the notion that this was (highly) virulent," to all, he says.</p>
<p>More than half of the local population has now been immunized against H1N1 and a substancial number of the rest likely had mild infections that will trigger their antibiotic system against any future waves.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ottawa Hospital cancels elective surgeries; Officials tackle patient overload</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>352 words</div><div>26 February 2010</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>The Ottawa Hospital, overwhelmed by a surge in patients over the past month, is cancelling a number of elective surgeries and accepting fewer patients from other hospitals.</p>
<p>The cancellations will not affect cancer patients or people who require "time-sensitive" treatment. Patients whose surgeries have been postponed previously will also not be affected.</p>
<p>Hospital officials are warning people who show up in emergency to expect longer-than-usual delays. The measures are expected to continue until at least Thursday.</p>
<p>"We want the community to know that we are under pressure and that we are having to cancel cases, which is something that we really don't want to do," said Dr. James Worthington, vice-president of medical affairs.</p>
<p>Worthington said overcrowding and bed shortages are particularly bad at the Civic campus, which, at one point recently, had an occupancy rate of 108 per cent.</p>
<p>Hospitals typically see higher volumes of patients in the winter, but at The Ottawa Hospital, admission rates have been above normal and have not let up since Feb. 1.</p>
<p>While the rates of flu and other respiratory illnesses are down, the hospital is seeing more patients in need of urgent surgery or medical treatment, said Worthington.</p>
<p>He is worried that patient safety would be compromised if staff continue to be overworked. "It increases the risk of an adverse event. I think it certainly increases the risk of hospital-acquired infections when the occupancy is so high and for such a sustained period.</p>
<p>"We just need time to diffuse the situation, get ourselves back down to what we would regard (as) a more normal occupancy (rate) so that we can feel better about all aspects of care."</p>
<p>Worthington likened the pressures to the worst days of the H1N1 pandemic last November, when hospitals were pushed to the limit.</p>
<p>The pressures are beyond the usual delays caused by the high number of elderly patients who occupy hospital beds because they have nowhere else to go while they wait to be transferred to a nursing home.</p>

</p>
<p>Re: Are disinfectants making you sick? Feb. 20.</p>
<p>Our industry group representing makers of disinfectant products believes it is irresponsible of the authors of this report to alarm consumers about using government-regulated products that have been scientifically proven to be effective against H1N1 and other viruses. All disinfectants for consumers sold in Canada are regulated by Health Canada and tested extensively to ensure they are safe when used according to the label instructions.</p>
<p>The Women's Voices for the Earth suggests consumers should substitute government-registered disinfectants with make-it-yourself solutions. Consumers should also be made aware that there is no evidence such homemade solutions are effective in killing harmful viruses.</p>
<p>During the H1N1 pandemic, Health Canada advised consumers to ensure any hard-surface disinfectants they select are authorized for sale in Canada and have a drug identification number and a label that acknowledges effective testing against viruses.</p>

<p>Canadian pork exports will get immediate access to China ahead of U.S. and Mexican shipments, all of which were shut out after China banned pork from H1N1-affected countries in spring 2009, federal Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said Thursday.</p>
<p>China lifted its bans on pork imports from all three countries in December. However, Canada is the first to meet China's certification requirements, which should give Canada a short-term competitive advantage over the United States and Mexico, Ritz said.</p>
<p>"Once the Chinese get a taste for the top-quality pork products that we have in Canada, it's going to be really tough for someone else to bump us out of the marketplace," Ritz said.</p>
<p>The agreement with China allows pork imports from all Canadian provinces, Ritz said. Canadian pork exports to China were worth $45 million in 2008. China decided to ban Canadian pork after a western Canadian hog herd tested positive for the H1N1 flu virus last spring.</p>

<p>There's something "not right" about some of the citizens of sleepy Ogden Marsh, Iowa. One minute they're going about their business. The next, they're stark-staring bonkers and homicidal maniacs to boot.</p>
<p>First-time director Breck Eisner has retooled George A. Romero's 1973 low-budget The Crazies for a modern audience, swapping the original's sex scenes and cheesy look for more realistic splatter and the slick style of a studio picture. But he stays loyal to Romero's original's intent, making a statement about the perils of a ruthless, self-serving government turning on its citizens, served up within the framework of a solid horror thriller.</p>
<p>Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) and his wife, Judy, the town doctor (Radha Mitchell), start seeing some decidedly oddball things in both lines of work, with the behaviour escalating to horrific heights.</p>
<p>Once-normal folks start off staring into space, and then quickly spiral into full-blown insanity. The next thing you know, they're either dropping dead or chasing you down with an autopsy saw.</p>
<p>David, with his good ol' boy deputy Russell Clank (Joe Anderson) in tow, unravels the mystery of what's behind the loco locals, discovering the water system has been contaminated with some sort of crazy-making virus.</p>
<p>All hell breaks loose with the arrival of the military in Hazmat suits. Townspeople are rounded up, loaded onto cattle trucks and herded into a containment site at the local high school. The fear and obsession surrounding who's sick and who's not leads to panic, for which the military quickly shows it has zero patience. It soon becomes evident who the true crazies are, and it's not the newly zombified residents.</p>
<p>Eisner brings plenty of tension and some gratifying scares amid the ordinariness of Main Street U.S.A., clapboard farmhouses and wide fields. And he doesn't need to rely on gore to achieve it, as seen in a run through a car wash that employs no blood, but will make you jumpy about more than whether you remembered to roll up the windows next time you wash your wheels.</p>
<p>That's not to say splatter fans don't get their fix. They do.</p>
<p>Screenwriter Scott Kosar, also responsible for remakes of The Amityville Horror (2005) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), teamed with Case 39 writer Ray Wright on the script. Despite the occasional dumb line, they keep things ticking along, aided by a solid cast. Handsome Olyphant makes a credible sheriff and a strong leading man. It's not as if the role of lawman is new to him; his former HBO western series Deadwood has spawned its own loyal Deadheads.</p>
<p>Aussi actress Radha Mitchell (Silent Hill) is equal to the task as zombie fighter and Anderson (Max in Across the Universe) brings a solid performance to the kind of role that rarely rises above second banana.</p>
<p>Toronto moviegoers who donned face masks during SARS or lined up for hours for H1N1 shots that never materialized may have their own personal take on how the government reacts to the looming epidemic in The Crazies.</p>
<p>Maybe we're all just one squirt of hand sanitizer away from anarchy ourselves.The Crazies</p>

<p>The controversy surrounding Danny Williams' heart surgery had all but dissipated: His ticker is on the mend, he'll be back at work soon and Canadians didn't seem to care that the Newfoundland premier went to Miami for the operation.</p>
<p>Then Williams gave a media interview in which he suggested that Canadian hospitals aren't up to the job. Williams seemed under the impression that the valve-repair procedure he wanted wasn't offered in Canada, when in fact it is. Canadian cardiac surgeons feel slighted.</p>
<p>Yet it is Williams' right as a consumer to get his research wrong. Williams is a wealthy man, and if he wanted to spend his money travelling to California to buy, say, a black Honda Accord, because he was under the mistaken impression that Canada doesn't sell black Accords, that's his prerogative.</p>
<p>"It's my health and it's my choice," said the premier. His public acknowledgement that medical patients are customers is an important breakthrough in the debate over health care in Canada. This isn't to say that Canadian health care should be wholly privatized. The point, rather, is that for too long it has been hard even to talk about any kind of reform, because health care enjoys a sacred status that exempts it completely from the normal rules of markets and competition.</p>
<p>Williams' medical tourism is a good reality check, a reminder that the mythology of universal and equal access to health care is just that, a myth. And it's not just that rich Canadians with connections get to go to the U.S. Rich Canadians with connections can get special treatment right here in Canada, as we saw when some of them jumped the queue for the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Williams shouldn't be demonized but thanked.</p>

<p>International visitors to Vancouver's Olympic Games brought along colourful flags, national pride, various noisemakers and, potentially, a litany of diseases ranging from cholera to H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>A new mapping tool created by two Canadian infectious-disease specialists offers the first real-time analysis of potential health threats at international events such as the 2010 Games.</p>
<p>“Mass gatherings draw millions of people from around the world into a single space, and can potentially amplify the threat of infectious disease,” said Kamran Khan of St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.</p>
<p>Dr. Khan is the developer of bio.DIASPORA, a mapping program that studies global air-traffic patterns to figure out how infectious diseases are likely to spread.</p>
<p>To study the Olympics, Dr. Khan teamed up with Montreal-born John Brownstein of Harvard Medical School, who is the co-founder of HealthMap, an online disease-tracking tool. Using computer algorithms and human monitors, the program trolls the Internet for signs of emerging epidemics – a sort of Web-enabled disease surveillance system.</p>
<p>By combining the two programs, which they have done at www.healthmap.org/olympics[http://www.healthmap.org/olympics], the researchers could see who was coming to Vancouver and what medical issues were being experienced in their countries of origin.</p>
<p>“This program allows you to narrow down the threat,” Dr. Khan said.</p>
<p>By studying travel patterns into Vancouver and the sites of previous Winter Games, he found that nearly two-thirds of visitors to Vancouver during the Olympics would arrive from just 25 cities around the world. And information from HealthMap showed they hailed from regions experiencing a number of public-health issues, including E. coli, measles, mumps and H1N1, although none of the health threats was deemed serious.</p>
<p>“Diseases don't respect national boundaries, but they do actually have to respect the rules that govern commercial air travel, because that's how they get around,” Dr. Khan said. “If you're aware of a threat at an upstream location, you can address it.”</p>
<p>Large international gatherings have contended with disease outbreaks in the past. During the 1991 Special Olympics, an event for athletes with intellectual disabilities, an outbreak of measles in the U.S. was triggered by an athlete from Argentina. And the Hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, has also seen outbreaks of disease. Dr. Brownstein says his mapping tool could be useful for preparations for this year's G20 summit in Ontario, as well as the FIFA World Cup in South Africa, both of which will be held in June.</p>
<p>Had an infectious disease broken out at the Vancouver Games, Dr. Brownstein says he is confident it would have been handled correctly by health authorities.</p>
<p>“They have incredible resources there and are very vigilant in their surveillance efforts,” he said. “I have no doubt that if any real event emerged they would have the capacity to deal with it.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Extremely Bad Advice;Steve Murray Gives Completely Unsupportable Guidance On How To Live Your Life</b>
</div><div>Steve Murray   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>669 words</div><div>25 February 2010</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>AL2</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Dear Steve: About a year ago, my live-in lady and I adopted an older dog. I thought we were being quite charitable -- especially me, because I prefer cats. Unfortunately, this dog has taken to doing all manner of businesses upon every non-furniture surface of our apartment, and we don't know what to do about it. My humane suggestion was to have it bronzed alive, dually euthanizing and commemorating a beloved household pet. This did not go over well with the lady. What do you suggest?</p>
<p>STEP ONE</p>
<p>I suppose the best thing you could do in this situation is bronze your pet, therefore euthanizing and ... wait, did ... did you just write that? I usually only skim the questions, but if so, that's some great advice! You know, lately I've been feeling my years. My eyesight is fading, my hair is greying, my impotence is potent. And it occurs to me that I have no one to groom with the goal of taking over this column when I need to be taken behind the advice barn and shot. See, my greatest fear is having my hundreds of lovable, simply illustrated characters fall into the wrong hands. What if the Comment section decides to litter their editorials with my Ugly Baby or my Dirty Hot Dog when I'm dead and gone? I need someone to preserve the integrity of this column and all the stuff it stands for or whatever. Is that someone you?</p>
<p>STEP TWO</p>
<p>Hmm, actually, upon reflection, your idea is pretty stupid. I remember my friend Gary doing something similar when he thought he had H1N1 and wanted to go out "on his own terms." It seemed relatively simple, being coated in a bucket of hot bronze and immortalized. But the pain was so much that Gary thrashed around for a good minute before the bronze hardened enough to restrain him. His final pose was nowhere near as regal as he wanted it to be. Attempting this on your senior dog will possibly yield the same results, that of a semi-beloved pet frozen in a howling pose of pain. Maybe not the best idea.</p>
<p>STEP THREE</p>
<p>The dog's already old, it's probably just a matter of days before it will legitimately need to be put down. I mean, if I found myself in the position where I was constantly pooing all over the house (instead of my usual routine of pooing in the yard for my master to pick up), I'd want to take that trip behind the aforementioned advice barn to meet the Ultimate Advicist (Gary, in Heaven). Create a pretence for arranging a vet house call for Ol' Poopers. Then, have a friend of yours pretend to be a vet, swing by the house, "diagnose," and put down your long-suffering pooch. Actually, your friend could rake in a lot of money with a business like that, where his only treatment for annoying or lousy pets is death. Something to think about.</p>
<p>STEP FOUR</p>
<p>It's been a while since I've prescribed this, but you should really have a baby. Once there's a baby on the scene, pleasantly pooping in a diaper and screaming at four in the morning, all patience will be lost with poop-pooch. Right now it's barely tolerable, but when you're handling the poop of multiple creatures, one's going to have to go. And in 95% of the cases, it's the geriatric dog that's poop-out-of-luck. You can always honour the memory of your beloved pet by naming the baby after it. My son can vouch for my advice. Hmm, I hadn't even considered leaving my column to Captain Chompers the Second.</p>
<p>Email your concerns to smurray@nationalpost.com.What about Captain Chompers the First?</p>

</p>
<p>The greatest flaw in B'nai Brith's annual audit of alleged anti-Semitic attacks on Canadian Jews and Jewish institutions is that it lumps the entirely trivial in with the truly appalling. An Internet blog posting blaming Jews for the H1N1 pandemic, for instance, is given equal importance alongside repeated death threats made to a rabbi. An 11-year-old boy "caught passing anti-Semitic notes at school" is seen as on a par with a man who pulled a knife on a Jewish father and his son while hurling racist epithets at them.</p>
<p>This fact alone makes B'nai Brith's final tally -- 1,264 anti-Semitic "incidents" in 2009 -- largely meaningless. This newspaper alone gets dozens of hateful spam emails from random bigots every week. That sort of thing is inevitable in a country of more than 30 million people. If we were to "report" all of these episodes to B'nai Brith, the organization's tally could easily double, or even triple. But that wouldn't mean that anti-Semitic hatred "is on the rise," as the group claims every year.</p>
<p>If B'nai Brith wants Canadians to appreciate the importance of the information in its 28-year-old census of anti-Jewish attacks, it has to stop using this one-size-fits-all approach, and begin highlighting the relatively small number of truly alarming assaults. Raising the hue and cry over the desecration of a cemetery is sensible. Raising the hue and cry because adolescent classmates haze each other with juvenile religious taunts is not.</p>
<p>Jews themselves often speak of one another in terms that closely resemble anti-Semitism. The radical left-wing activists at the Toronto-based group "Independent Jewish Voices," for instance, have promoted blood libels against Israeli troops that resemble the worst species of anti-Semitic Palestinian propaganda. Should those episodes be included in B'nai Brith's report, too?</p>
<p>Like a lot of groups, B'nai Brith spends a lot of ink promoting itself and seeking donations. In this spirit, it boasts that Statistics Canada and other "authoritative sources around the world" view its audit as "the single most credible study of the phenomenon of anti-Semitism and patterns of prejudice in Canada." But as with any victimization study, no matter how "authoritative," it is based on self-reported incidents. B'nai Brith says its statistics show "a more than fivefold increase in [anti-Semitic] incidents over the past decade." What it really shows is a fivefold increase in the number of people willing to call B'nai Brith about their bad experiences --in large part thanks to the group's own heavy investment in its own brand: As annual audits such as this become better known, they will attract more and more callers, driving up the statistics even if no more episodes take place than in the previous year.</p>
<p>Similarly, the number of hate speech complaints observed likely reflects a technological expansion of the number of places hateful speech can be uttered. Five years ago, few Canadians used <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. Now, millions do. A single anti-Semitic status update from a single bigot can attract dozens of follow-up responses. Every one of them counts as an anti-Semitic "episode" according to B'nai Brith's dilatory calculus.</p>
<p>It is true that violence in the Middle East has led to an increase in anti-Semitic rhetoric in some contexts, particularly on Canadian campuses. But B'nai Brith's claim that anti-Semitism in this country is a widespread and rising problem flies in the face of reality. This is probably the least anti-Semitic country in the entire world -- including Israel -- and it becomes more tolerant, not less, with every passing year.</p>
<p>B'nai Brith does all sorts of fine work. But its survey of anti-Semitic incidents shouldn't blindly group all attacks together, regardless of their severity. Instead of scaring Jews into thinking that they are living in a state of anti-Semitic siege, B'nai Brith should update its mandate and methods to reflect the tolerant Canadian reality.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Retention plan gives Nortel added flexibility</b>
</div><div>Bert Hill   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1019 words</div><div>24 February 2010</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>If didn't keep Joe Flanagan from leaving, but the rich new Nortel employee retention program looks like a gift that will keep on giving.</p>
<p>Flanagan, the former head of Nortel Business Services, has been hired by <span class="companylink">Applied Materials</span> as senior vice-president of worldwide operations of the big California maker of chip-making technology. A former <span class="companylink">General Electric</span> executive recruited by former Nortel chief executive Mike Zafirovski, Flanagan resigned last week and was replaced at NBS by Christoper Ricaurte.</p>
<p>He got a two-year $2.5-million retention incentive package. The latest controversial Nortel Networks incentive plan for retaining and motivating employees could deliver much more than $92.4 million to 1,475 employees. It has been expanded in several ways to capture potential contingencies and avoid future public controversy.</p>
<p>For starters, the plan, subject to court approval, gives the company power to spend up to $7 million more if necessary to add new members to the plan or make changes as job responsibilities change. In addition, the plans sets up a "a discretionary pool" of up to $20 million in additional payments.</p>
<p>The insolvent company said the payments will be tied to "additional performance metrics developed by the debtors (Nortel), in consultation" with creditors including the official committee, bondholders and the monitor.</p>
<p>"These performance metrics will be tied to, among other things, creditor recoveries" and will be subject to court approval. While Nortel said that 88 per cent of the $92.4-million pool will be paid from service agreements with Ericsson, <span class="companylink">Ciena</span>, <span class="companylink">Avaya</span> and other companies buying Nortel product lines, there is no disclosure on whether the additional funding will come from creditor recoveries or the assets of the company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nortel continues to shed employees aggressively. It cut 9,200 jobs or 37 per cent of the global workforce of 25,000 a year ago over the last year. In Canada the headcount of 5,900 fell by 1,650 or 28 per cent of the workforce.</p>
<p>Nortel says about 13,000 employees have or will transfer to new employers.</p>
<p>But about 10,000 won't be so lucky. Some will provide transition services for up to two years, but most will likely join the long line on layoff waiting to see how much severance they might eventually get.</p>
<p>Nortel expects to have a workforce of 2,500 later this year, including 475 in Canada, providing support services to the new division owners, selling Nortel real estate and other property, processing creditor claims and winding up the operation.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Avaya</span> is the undisputed champion of the corporate phone market after buying Nortel enterprise communications business for $915 million.</p>
<p>Now comes the tough part. The New Jersey company has 375 employees in Ottawa. It said Nortel integration costs helped drive up losses 33 per cent to $136 million in the December-ending quarter compared to a year earlier. Even with the addition of $43 million from two weeks of Nortel revenues, <span class="companylink">Avaya</span> revenues fell five per cent to $1.06 billion. Sales in Europe and Latin America fell 15 per cent and 29 per cent respectively.</p>

<p>Haven't got the sniffles, right? Inverness Medical, the Boston-area company with a big deal with Epocal, an Ottawa startup, said sales of flu medication have unexpectedly evaporated this season.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer Ron Zwanziger said, "We assumed a relatively weak flu season, which often happens after a high flu season. But, up until now, it hasn't just been weak, as it's been nonexistent."</p>
<p>In the last half of 2009, Inverness flu medication sales almost tripled to $80 million driven by huge sales of H1N1 treatments compared to the same period a year earlier. Now it looks like sales could revert to the $25-million range of two years ago.</p>
<p>Zwanziger said, "There is no flu at the moment and this late in the season, you might have thought the seasonal flu would start up, and so it's a bit odd, but there basically is no flus going around"</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Alcatel-Lucent</span> is paying $137.4 million to avoid U.S. prosecution for allegedly paying bribes to win business around the world. The company, which has more than 2,000 Ottawa employees, also promised to clean up sales operations. Chief executive Ben Verwaayen has instructed the company to stop selling through business agents. The trouble started several years ago in Costa Rica, where a former <span class="companylink">Alcatel</span> regional sales chief admitted helping funnel bribes to a national telecommunication authority to win contracts. An investigation turned up problematic sales in Taiwan, Kenya and French Polynesia. To avoid U.S. prosecution, <span class="companylink">Alcatel</span> entered a three-year probation period.</p>
<p>On a happier note, Dell'Oro market research shows there was some good news in the latest dismal financial results. <span class="companylink">Alcatel-Lucent</span> moved ahead of <span class="companylink">Juniper Networks</span> to become the second-biggest global seller of edge routing gear, gaining five percentage points of market share. Only <span class="companylink">Cisco</span> is bigger. The edge routing gear -- spurned by Nortel, which thought it could develop better products -- is supported by <span class="companylink">Alcatel</span> operations in the U.S. and Ottawa. It is emerging as a critical piece of technology as the Internet struggles with a rising wave of traffic from wireless and laptop users downloading videos, sending messages and doing searches.</p>
<p>Briefly</p>
<p><span class="companylink">PharmaGap Inc</span>. has raised $855,625 in new financing through the sale of securities, to finance development of a potential cancer treatment by the Ottawa company.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Descartes Systems Group</span> is paying about $41 million U.S. for Porthus-Zemblaz, a European trade management company, to expand markets for global shipping products. The company has more than 1,000 customers and 170 employees in Belgium and Slovakia.</p>
<p>Mitel Networks, which is working on a stock market launch, will hold a special shareholders meeting March 5 to consolidate privately-held stock and approve stock options. Mitel announced it is working with VMware, a powerhouse in improving data-centre efficiency, on new technology offerings that have won deals in the U.S. and Europe.</p>

<p>It is too early to say that the swine flu pandemic has peaked in all parts of the world, the World Health Organization's emergency committee said Tuesday. Spokesman Gregory Hartl said the decision of 15 experts was not binding and that a final decision would be taken by WHO Secretary General Margaret Chan. Several countries have been running down their costly special pandemic flu precautions recently, while new recommendations issued by the WHO for later this year incorporate the A(H1N1) virus into seasonal vaccines.</p>

</p>
<p>After months of infecting and killing thousands, it has all but disappeared. But not according to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>The U.N. agency's emergency committee, a 15-member influenza expert panel, has determined that it's too premature to say the H1N1 pandemic virus is past its peak.</p>
<p>The panel deliberated for two hours on Tuesday and advised director-general Margaret Chan that while the virus is not circulating widely in many parts of the world, there's new transmission in West Africa and it's still unclear how the virus will spread when the southern hemisphere enters its winter months.</p>
<p>“Based on the evidence that was presented in that discussion and based on the subsequent discussions and the views of the emergency committee the director-general decided that it was appropriate not to make any changes in the current pandemic phases right now,” Keiji Fukuda, the WHO's top influenza expert, told reporters in a briefing Wednesday.</p>
<p>If the WHO had declared the pandemic past its peak, it would have signalled to countries that they could prepare to transition out of pandemic mode. But they still had to remain vigilant.</p>
<p>The committee will review the status of the pandemic again in a few weeks to decide if the world has moved into the post-peak phase. But Dr. Fukuda noted that the virus is not as severe than previously believed.</p>
<p>“We don't really know what the final impact is and we won't know what it is until a year or two after the pandemic is over, but it appears to be on the less severe side of the spectrum of pandemics that we have seen in the 20th century,” he said.</p>
<p>Canadian health officials have declared the second wave of the pandemic over for this country. The disappearance of H1N1 in Canada can be explained: Because about 45 per cent of Canadians have been vaccinated, and another 30 per cent were diagnosed with it and are thus immune, there are fewer people to infect, making its spread that much more difficult.</p>
<p>But the virus is still spreading in parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The WHO said there's activity in African countries such as Senegal and Mauritania.</p>
<p>Canada, which in retrospect ordered too much vaccine, donated five million doses to the WHO to help the Geneva-based international body redistribute the vaccine to developing countries that couldn't afford their own supplies. Even after the donation, Canada is left with tens of millions of unclaimed doses. The federal government could choose to donate more down the line, or it can keep some of the remaining vaccine in reserve in case the virus returns. The vaccine has a shelf life of 18 months.</p>

</p>
<p>While the World Health Organization says H1N1 has not peaked internationally, the pandemic is considered unofficially over in Canada.</p>
<p>"Clearly, in Canada, H1N1 is gone," Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious disease prevention and control with the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, said Tuesday.</p>
<p>"It doesn't mean it's gone forever, but it's gone right now. There is really no flu around. That's everywhere across the country," Gardam said. Toronto Public Health closed the last of its mass vaccination clinics in January, but some physicians continue to offer the shot in their offices, said Dr. Barbara Yaffe, the city's associate medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"Over the last while we have had zero to two to three cases reported a week," she said.</p>
<p>The WHO's emergency committee, composed of 15 experts, met Tuesday and said it's premature to downgrade the global flu outbreak.</p>
<p>WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan will make the official announcement Wednesday, and governments and the public will be watching the wording very carefully.</p>
<p>Dr. Nancy Cox of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a member of the WHO emergency committee, said in an interview with Reuters that "it's very, very difficult to get the wording exactly right."</p>
<p>According to the WHO's latest weekly update, H1N1 transmission persists in limited areas of eastern and southern Europe, South Asia, and in East Asia.</p>
<p>Officially, Canada is still in pandemic mode and won't move away from level 6 on the alert scale until the United Nations agency does.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Public Health Agency of Canada, visits to doctors by patients with flu-like symptoms spiked in late October.</p>
<p>Of every 1,000 doctor visits, about 113 were from patients with influenza symptoms.</p>
<p>"It peaked by Halloween, and by the end of December it was largely gone. Over the last two months it has been essentially nonexistent," Gardam said.</p>
<p>A feared "third wave" won't happen here since so many people now have antibodies against the virus, Gardam said.</p>
<p>Estimates show that 20 to 30 per cent of Ontarians got the bug, he noted. And according to the health ministry, 38 per cent of the population has been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a similar strain is expected to come back as seasonal flu next fall. But much of the population will have the antibodies to fight it and a vaccine will be ready in time for flu season.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus itself was not as lethal as officials first feared. Worldwide, it has been responsible for almost 16,000 deaths. In Canada, it resulted in 78 deaths and 1,488 hospitalizations.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A healthy correction</b>
</div><div>Jonathan Ratner   </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>1222 words</div><div>24 February 2010</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>FP9</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Recent concerns about sovereign debt defaults in Europe are overblown and are creating some buying opportunities, according to Alex Lane, portfolio manager at Dynamic Funds.</p>
<p>"Just like the swine flu, we think the worries about the PIIGS will pass," he says, referring to Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, Lane expects to see cyclical stocks and emerging markets outperform. Commodities and related currencies should also strengthen.</p>
<p>The manager is currently hedged at about 80% against to the U.S. dollar. As the Canadian dollar approaches parity with the greenback or even overshoots it, Lane anticipates that he will take those hedges down as the entire commodity complex will likely go through a corrective phase.</p>
<p>"From March 2009 to January 2010, we basically had an unchecked advance in the markets," he says. "This provides an excuse for a healthy correction that accompanies the economic recovery."</p>
<p>The manager points out that both economic data and earnings for the fourth quarter have been fantastic, with even better guidance provided for the coming quarters. He also notes that the year-over-year math is promising for the first quarter given that nothing really happened in Q1 2009.</p>
<p>The second half of 2010 doesn't have the same advantage. And while he expects the data will only be slightly better in the fourth quarter, the math becomes very positive again for 2011, when each quarter should be better than the last.</p>
<p>As a result, Lane plans to increase exposure to health care, utilities and consumer staples in the next few months.</p>
<p>Lane believes the industrial and technology sectors will generate the most earnings growth, revisions and upside surprises. He also feels valuations are quite depressed in both areas.</p>
<p>"Technology has done its time in the penalty box," he says. "It's seen 10 years of consolidation, capacity rationalization, and now has few remaining players in control of large amounts of market share. All they have been waiting for is the uptick in demand and we believe we are seeing that, particularly in telecom components and equipment."</p>
<p>Lane cites three demand drivers pushing the need for bandwidth: Growth in mobile internet through devices like iPhones and BlackBerrys; video over the Internet via web sites like Hulu and <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>; and cloud computing where data and services are stored offsite.</p>
<p>While telecom companies used to spend 15% of revenues on capex when in a steady state, 18% to 20% in growth mode, and sometimes as much as 22% during the tech boom, they have been below 12% for the past 10 years, Lane notes.</p>
<p>With customers demanding better service and companies having many of their critical applications online, the fact Michael Jackson's death almost crippled the internet's main eastern hub shows how fragile the infrastructure is.</p>
<p>"There is finally an impetus for there to be spending on the networks again. These cycles tend to be multi-year in nature and it's really early on."</p>
<p>jratner@nationalpost.com---------</p>
<p>BUYS</p>
<p><span class="companylink">FINISAR CORP</span>. (FNSR/NASDAQ).</p>
<p>Lane believes there is significant upside to earnings estimates for Finisar, a leading supplier of components for optical, storage and enterprise networking. With the capex cycle picking up again, he notes that telecom components tend to benefit first as carriers look to fill up their existing equipment to capacity before buying new equipment.</p>
<p>Lane also points out that telecom component stocks traded at enterprise value/ sales ratios of 4x to 5x as recently as 2004, but are currently trading around 1x sales.</p>
<p>"Finisar, like many of its peers, has replenished its balance sheet and is in a good financial position," the manager says, noting his target price of roughly US$17 per share.</p>
<p>He also owns <span class="companylink">JDS Uniphase Corp</span>., which along with Finisar and <span class="companylink">Cisco Systems Inc</span>., have all raised their guidance on strong order trends and better margins.</p>
<p>RIVERSDALE MINING LTD. (RIV/ASX).</p>
<p>This emerging Australian producer of hard coking coal has its best prospects from assets in Mozambique. The world-class Benga project appeals to steelmakers in China and India due to its quality and freight cost advantages, Lane notes.</p>
<p>He highlights the fact that CVRD will be investing heavily in the region as it tries to duplicate its iron ore dominance in Brazil. CVRD's property is right beside Riversdale, so the infrastructure benefits will likely be shared.</p>
<p>The manager also notes that India's <span class="companylink">Tata Steel</span> owns 35% of Benga and around 20% of Riversdale's common equity, while Brazil's CSN owns 16.5% of the company. As a result, he suggested that it should be a consolidation candidate.</p>
<p>So while Riversdale isn't what Lane would consider cheap and the stock has plenty of volatility, he expects it will continue to have a regular place in the portfolio.</p>
<p>ENAGAS SA (ENG/MADRID).</p>
<p>This regulated Spanish utility, an anchor name in the fund, is what Lane considers a perfect example of a secular growth story.</p>
<p>He notes that Enagas trades at a discount to all other European utilities, but boasts better growth and a higher dividend.</p>
<p>All in, the manager says it should provide a 15% average annual return over the next five years.</p>
<p>"There is very little you can buy to play European gas independence," he says, noting the merger of <span class="companylink">Gaz de France</span> and Suez as an effort to limit Russia's dominance.</p>
<p>Enagas controls 90% of gas distribution within Spain, has assets with a long life of 20 to 40 years, and may eventually export gas to France, Lane notes.</p>
<p>"Regardless of if there are any troubles at the sovereign debt level in Spain, this company will have no problem getting financing," he says.</p>
<p>SELL</p>
<p><span class="companylink">IRON MOUNTAIN INC</span>. (IRM/NYSE).</p>
<p>While Lane likes this information protection and storage services firm longer-term for its secular growth and defensive characteristics, he feels current earnings growth is too low to sustain its rich P/ E multiple.</p>
<p>As a result, he has exited the name in favour of better near-term opportunities, particularly in technology, given the market pullback. So while this is a short-term call, it was nonetheless a full positional sell.</p>
<p>The manager notes that Iron Mountain will likely be bought back in the US$16 to US18 range later in the year when defensives begin to outperform again.</p>
<p>"It's got a high multiple and is just suffering from a multiple contraction right now."</p>
<p>The stock traded at about US$20 a year ago, then rose well above US$30 in July 2009. Since then, it has fallen below US$25 per share.</p>

</p>
<p>"It's the start of my new life," said the woman at the till as she paid for a bag bulging with prescription drugs.</p>
<p>We got talking. It turns out her young son had H1N1 last fall and just couldn't seem to shake it. He was much more tired than usual. Then he started drinking, and peeing, copiously.</p>
<p>When she finally took him to the doctor, his blood sugar level was off the charts. "Take your son to the hospital immediately," she was told, "or he could slip into a diabetic coma."</p>
<p>He now has to have daily insulin injections. And while he seemed to adjust to his illness at first, he's now "full of rage." Nevertheless, his mother feels very fortunate: "One hundred years ago, he wouldn't have survived."</p>
<p>To lesser and greater degrees, of course, that goes for a lot of us.</p>
<p>Despite some justifiable criticisms of the pharmaceutical industry and the medical system, many of our lives would be vastly less healthy ones were it not for a range of modern treatments and procedures.</p>
<p>Most medical conditions used to be attributed to either too much or too little of the four "humours" (black bile, yellow bile, phlegm and blood) and their corresponding effect on our personalities.</p>
<p>But modern medicine has demonstrated that cause and effect is usually a lot less idiosyncratic -- and a lot more physiological -- than we ever imagined.</p>
<p>I think of the friend who, at around 18, suddenly went from being vital and athletic to lethargic and depressed. Most of his 20s were spent wondering why he felt and acted the way he did, until he was finally diagnosed with an underactive thyroid. And although he'll be on medication for the rest of his life, he's now much more adjusted.</p>
<p>I also think of a friend's toddler who was having trouble learning to talk and fell down a lot when he walked. A sufferer of frequent ear infections -- which can cause balance and behavioural problems and hearing loss -- he recently got tiny "myringotomy tubes."</p>
<p>This is the most common surgery performed on children in North America: A tiny tube is placed through a pinpoint hole made in the eardrum, which immediately drains ear fluid and allows the patient to regain hearing and equilibrium.</p>
<p>When the little boy got home an hour or so after his surgery, he started to run. "And it's like he's never stopped," my friend says.</p>
<p>In other words, he wasn't developmentally "slow," as once might have been imagined. He stopped falling and started talking because he'd been treated for something as banal as an ear infection.</p>
<p>Speaking of banal: Were it not for the modern benefits of high-powered lenses, orthodontics and the occasional chiropractic back "adjustment," I would be a short-sighted (make that legally blind) thirtysomething with buckled teeth and bad posture. In other words, I would have cut quite a figure 100-some years ago.</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<p>History, too, is full of social and medical mysteries which have come to be more fully explained with recent discoveries about various physical conditions.</p>
<p>It's now understood, for example, that lead in pipes and as a preservative for wine contributed to the decline of ancient Rome. In particular, once women started being allowed to drink wine, there was a marked drop in the birth rate.</p>
<p>England's "mad" King George III, whose urine eventually turned blue, is now believed to have suffered from porphyria, a rare genetic disorder -- symptoms of which were probably exacerbated by arsenic in his medications.</p>
<p>A link has also been established between ergot poisoning, caused by fungus-blighted rye during particularly wet years, and those who accused others of witchcraft during the Salem, Mass., witch trials in 1692.</p>
<p>In 1976, then American college student (now professor) Linnda Caporael -- whose findings were published in a front page story in the New York Times -- established that the "bewitched" accusers suffered from LSD-like hallucinations (LSD is a derivative of ergot), as well as convulsions and "bizarre skin sensations."</p>
<p>Once normal precipitation levels returned, most of the accusers came to their senses. And ultimately, "townsfolk were at a loss to explain their own actions."</p>
<p>How tragic that, throughout history, so much human woe could have been avoided if, for example, thyroid conditions, diabetes and even ear infections could have been diagnosed and treated -- let alone if people hadn't consumed lead-laden wine or fungus-infested rye.</p>

<p>Sharon Modeste recalls the stunned numbness she felt the day her vibrant young son succumbed to the H1N1 virus just before Christmas. Advanced by the 21-year-old's diabetes, the flu felled Matthew Modeste in a matter of days.</p>
<p>But the family is just now learning how their loss has saved several lives.</p>
<p>"To me he's a hero. He gave somebody a second chance in life," an emotional Ms. Modeste said during an interview at her apartment in Toronto's Weston neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Mr. Modeste, an aspiring rapper known as "Scrilla," donated his kidneys, liver, eyes and some tissue. At least three people -- ranging in age from 22 to more than 50 years old -- have been saved as a result, the family recently learned through the provincial organ donor agency.</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Modeste, whose first full album was about to be released when he died on Dec. 14, will live on in another way. His fledgling music company, True Family Records, plans to release a tribute album this year, with Scrilla's posthumous debut following closely on its heels. Mr. Modeste's sound was informed by his experiences growing up in some of Toronto's rougher neighborhoods, said Tao Piccasso, a friend and fellow rapper.</p>
<p>"He talks to the less fortunate, to the single-parent mothers, welfare people, to gangsters, to people in jail.... He always glorified the smallest thing. Everyone would talk about <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> to put in a record, but he would say RC Cola," Mr. Piccasso said.</p>
<p>Wearing shirts emblazoned with Scrilla's name, his True Family colleagues laugh as they recall how he used to-chase people down on subways and hock his early demo CDs for "two toonies and a loonie."</p>
<p>"If he sees you, he's going to attack you with CD sales," Mr. Piccasso said. If someone chose not to buy a CD, Mr. Modeste would provide the sleeve for free in hopes it would drive people to his website. Sharon Modeste said she urged her son to get the H1N1 shot, but he refused, saying "if it's his time to go, it's his time to go."</p>
<p>"There's some days where I'm OK and other days I just break down," his mother said. "I miss him. I'm missing him now. I remember he used to come through the door and say, 'Mom, you're good?' "</p>

<p>Re: "Consumers need to be safe -- from government," Karen Selick, Opinion, Feb. 17.</p>
<p>New laws are notoriously subject to challenges. Lawyers have already expressed concerns that companies will contest the provisions, the very high fines and other penalties in Bill C-6. In the absence of an appeal process, these cases will go to the Federal Court of Canada. These challenges will slow the implementation of long-overdue measures to protect Canadians. This proposed new law will not be on the books for years. What happens to product safety in the interim? The Canadian public and industry will be the real losers. The winners: government bureaucrats, lawyers and lobbyists. Public health and safety is not high on the agenda of this ideologically driven government. Its record of failure and indifference speaks for itself: food safety, aviation safety, rail safety, the isotope fiasco. The jury is still out on the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>

<p>TORONTO -- Its worldwide spread could not be stopped. It infected and killed thousands, pushing countries to rush to develop a vaccine that would limit its reach. The World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level to the maximum 6. But now, months later, is the H1N1 pandemic virus still creating havoc?</p>
<p>That's the main topic of discussion when the WHO's emergency committee of 15 influenza experts meets tomorrow. New clusters of the virus may still emerge, but Gregory Hartl, WHO's spokesman for the H1N1 pandemic, said the experts will look at the possibility of moving into a new phase of the pandemic.</p>
<p>What are the main talking points of the meeting?</p>
<p>The emergency committee … will be meeting to look, first of all, at the current epidemiological situation to see how the pandemic has been progressing. Secondly, it will consider whether or not temporary recommendations should be continued [such as trade or travel restrictions]. … We are also using this meeting to look at a third point – the emergency committee will be asked to consider whether or not we are now in what is called a post-peak period. Are we past the peak of the pandemic? Are we past the peak of H1N1 transmission? The committee will look at the evidence, will consider the evidence and then will make a decision and recommendation on whether we are past the peak or not.</p>
<p>What markers will be examined to determine if the virus is in the post-peak period?</p>
<p>If you looked at how many cases, for example, per week of H1N1 infection there have been since this started, are they going down or are they going up in those countries? They look at factors like that.</p>
<p>If it's determined that we are in the post-peak period, what signal does it send to the world?</p>
<p>It basically says countries should do two things: First of all, we are still in the pandemic. So we need to still be prepared for there being perhaps localized upsurges of activity in the coming months. In a generalized fashion, it means that we probably will not see an upsurge all over the world of pandemic activity. … And secondly, it would be a signal for countries, on the one hand, while they are being vigilant and continue to remain vigilant, they need to start making plans and preparing to transition out of pandemic mode.</p>
<p>So when is the pandemic over?</p>
<p>To know that the pandemic is over, we really have to see a bit more evidence of the fact that there isn't a lot of influenza activity out of season. So we wouldn't want to see pandemic influenza in the summer period. We would need to see what happens in the summer, for example, in the Northern Hemisphere before we could say definitively [the pandemic is over]. And for the moment at least, pandemic H1N1 has a disproportionate effect on pregnant women or young children or people with underlying respiratory conditions. … Those are groups who are normally not affected by influenza. As long as these groups are being affected by H1N1, it means that H1N1 is not behaving like a seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>This pandemic hasn't been as devastating as first thought, at least in North America. Will the criteria on determining a pandemic be reviewed?</p>
<p>Certainly we always can learn how to do things better. But there's no doubt in our minds that this was a pandemic, because the definition of a pandemic is the worldwide spread of a virus to which people do not have immunity. … I think that at some point in the future, certainly the pandemic preparedness guidance of which the levels are part of, they'll be reviewed. It behooves us to update the pandemic preparedness guidance to take account of what we've learned, what we've experienced and how science develops.</p>

</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus first emerged in Mexico and soon spread into a global pandemic. But there is another pathogen more lasting and damaging to the health and well-being of society. First diagnosed in the 1600s, moral hazard disease is a condition caused by protecting people from the consequences of their actions. The recent economic crisis has launched a full-fledged moral hazard pandemic.</p>
<p>The spread of a disease requires both vulnerable victims and mobile carriers. The original victims of the financial crisis were low-income Americans who, aided by their government's “a home for all” policies and by mortgage brokers earning bonuses based on volume, took on mortgages they couldn't afford. The carriers were Wall Street investment bankers who, aided by scandalously unprofessional credit rating agencies, earned even bigger bonuses for packaging these toxic loans and selling them to a second set of unsuspecting victims.</p>
<p>Then came governments, the most effective disease carriers of all. Again starting in the United States: bank, insurance company and auto bailouts placed those whose actions helped cause the pandemic in the same or even better position than those who had acted prudently. Soon after, governments in the United Kingdom and Western Europe were infected by moral hazard disease, backing failed banks with sovereign credit that provided them with a cost-of-capital advantage over those banks whose prudent capital ratios and lending practices had immunized them from the pandemic.</p>
<p>Moral hazard disease doesn't strike only individuals and companies. It's most virile and devastating strain strikes the governance of an entire country. Greece – with its dysfunctional governance, out-of-control deficits, bloated and unaccountable public service, business-crippling bureaucracy and institutionalized corruption – has long been a prime example. Its immediate crisis is that €25-billion ($35.3-billion) of public debt must be refinanced in April and another €30-billion before year end. No sane banker is going to participate without seeing a clear reversal of Greece's upward spiralling deficit.</p>
<p>Yet denial of responsibility, the classic symptom of moral hazard disease, is virulent in the country. Commenting on the skyrocketing costs of Greek credit-default insurance, Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou told reporters: “Any European country can fall prey to speculative forces.” Meanwhile, public-sector unions paralyzed airports, schools, hospitals and government offices protesting government proposals to merely freeze salaries. Rather than face the reality of the country's impending economic collapse, union leaders are betting that fear of collateral damage from a sovereign credit default by a euro zone country will push the European Union into bailing out Greece. Such action would inevitably lead to bailouts of the EU's other over-extended members, including Spain, Portugal and Italy.</p>
<p>While other trembling EU leaders support such a bailout, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government understands such action could ultimately destroy the euro zone. German economy committee member Michael Fuchs summed up this sentiment by stating: “If we start now, where do we stop?”</p>
<p>There is a much better way to ensure the Greek moral hazard pandemic doesn't infect the whole euro zone: Cut them loose. And there is a very strong argument as to why this is justified. Greece has perpetuated a decade-long fraud that hid real debt ratios well beyond the limits that were a condition of euro-zone membership. And, mirroring the U.S. economic crisis, the enablers were Wall Street investment bankers.</p>
<p>In 2001, shortly after Greece was admitted to the euro zone, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> devised a way to hide billions of dollars of borrowings from view. The government traded away streams of future revenues such as airport fees and lottery profits under a Goldman-designed structure that disguised otherwise disclosable debt as a currency trade. And Goldman president Gary Cohn and team arrived in Athens last November with another financing plan that reportedly would have pushed the country's health-care debt off the books. Fearing it might not get away with the same ruse twice, Athens rejected the deal.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that Greece entered the European Monetary Union hiding a far larger debt and deficit than permitted under admission rules. This Greek tragedy is playing out while athletes in Vancouver pursue the high ideals of ancient Olympia. When competitors are caught cheating, they are tossed out. Modern Greece has cheated its way into the euro zone, and it should face the same rules its ancient citizens passed on to the world.</p>
<p>The economic crisis has triggered a series of bailouts protecting companies, individuals and unions from the consequences of their actions. Now countries themselves are expecting to be relieved of that responsibility. An EU bailout of Greece would surely lead to the rampant spread of moral hazard disease deadly to the future of the world's largest economic zone.</p>

<p>Let the fur fly</p>
<p>On one page, Lindor Reynolds shared readers' pet peeves (young people's grammar, people who fumble for their money in the express lane...). On the facing age was a story about the medical risks of allowing pets on planes. Dr. Matthew Stanbrook, a respirologist, said they should not be allowed because of possible severe allergic reactions to the furry friends, and if Air Canada doesn't change its policy, they should 'be made to do so by government agencies.'</p>
<p>Air Canada says it has received all of three complaints about its pets policy. If you will allow us, Ms Reynolds, we'd like to add another pet peeve to your list: People who have so little regard for the paying public, they want the government to control everything.</p>
<p>Clean freaks</p>
<p>Based on buying habits alone, it would appear your average back-lane alchoholic is also a germophobe. Just look at the Lysol bottles littering their favourite haunts. And it is heartwarming how quickly they enlisted in the war against H1N1, practically clearing store shelves of hand sanitizer. But it turns out they aren't using it to clean their hands. They are drinking it. And those who prefer their beverage on tap are stealing it from wall-mounted dispensers in public places. Winnipeg Regional Health Authority spokesperson Heidi Graham said the problem of sanitizer theft has reached the point where hospitals are now locking the dispensers to discourage theft.</p>
<p>Let the real games begin</p>
<p>The world's best athletes are competing in Vancouver right now, but the real game-playing will start shortly after the Olympic flame is extinguished, and it's all because of Own The Podium, columnist Dan Lett writes. In that program, the private sector and the federal government teamed up to provide $110 million to help the country's most promising athletes win a ton of medals. If our athletes don't deliver, well, that won't do anything to lift the surly mood when the prorogued parliament resumes sitting. But if our athletes succeed, that could open up a whole new can of worms. Why? Because the Harper government has already hinted funding will be slashed for Olympic athletes, providing the opposition with a golden opportunity to portray the Tories as the Grinch that stole Olympic glory.</p>
<p>Bucking them out?</p>
<p>For months and months, while the recession raged, Manitoba officials insisted that the province was bucking the trend. So it is interesting to watch the desperate measures being considered now to balance the city and provincial budgets. Mayor Sam Katz is gambling on winning a $10.6 million tax shell game with <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>, claiming Hydro should have calculated a 2.5 per cent municipal tax after adding GST to the bill. And over at the legislature, the NDP government, is pushing for a two-year wage freeze to deal with a $600 million projected budget deficit. It turns out things weren't quite as all right as we were led to believe. And with elections not that far away, things could be a whole lot less all right for some elected officials.</p>
<p>Barack off</p>
<p>There are at least two juicy rumours making the rounds on a computer near you. Rumour No. 1: Barack Obama never attended Columbia University, as his resume states. Rumour No. 2: The Atlanta Thrashers are moving to Winnipeg. When you remove the inflammatory language from the breathless Obama viral emails and check the so-called facts, Rumour No. 1 disappears in a puff of smoke. Free Press Sports columnist Tim Campbell gave Rumour No. 2 the same treatment, with the same result. Campbell suggests the best way to tell when the NHL will be back in town is to check the building permits at city hall. No, it won't be a permit to add more seating to the MTS Centre.

<p>Doing the can-can</p>
<p>What's the 'most sensitive issues of all time' facing Winnipeggers? Car theft? Spraying for mosquitoes? Beating Ottawa in the world's longest frozen patch of muddy water category? No, it's the size of your can. We heard it right from Mayor Sam Katz's mouth after a four-hour bitch session at city hall resulted in changes -- once again -- to the city's waste management plan. The new recommendations would allow Winnipeggers to pay an annual fee to use a supersized garbage can. As well, blue boxes would be replaced by much larger rolling blue bins. It all goes to vote on Feb. 24. The way all the trash talk has been accumulating around the city over this issue, the new measures might be coming into effect just in time.</p>
<p>Youth For Nihilism</p>
<p>Imagine taking a neglected eyesore of a corner at Main Street and Higgins Avenue and turning it into a multi-sport gym, dance studio, fitness centre, skate park, theatre and job-training centre. Despicable, isn't it? That is what Winnipeg Centre MP Pat Martin would have you believe. The problem is, it's a Christian group that wants to build the complex. Youth For Christ, which has already raised $3.1 million, is seeking some government money to finish the project. But, Martin asks, don't you see what they're up to? They just want to use the fancy centre to convert "vulnerable, impressionistic kids' to their fundamentalist Christian views. No, we wouldn't want that, especially since the local gangs are already doing such a great job converting those impressionistic kids to their fundamentally nihilistic views.</p>

<p>Red Deer, Alta. -- Could the experts be missing the obvious (Seasonal Flu Virus Takes A Holiday: ‘Nothing, Nada' – Feb. 19)? Perhaps seasonal flu seems to have disappeared because people are washing their hands often, and covering their mouths when they cough and sneeze, due to H1N1 awareness campaigns. Hand-washing has proven to be the single biggest defence against the person-to-person spread of infection in hospitals and clinics, so it seems reasonable that in everyday life, the impact may also be significant.</p>

<p>Alberta's Auditor General Fred Dunn hung up his magnifying glass last week, choosing to retire three months before his contract was to have expired in May. Amid the popping corks of bubbly and hale-fellow-well-met modulations, careful listeners might also discern a certain sigh of relief emanating from certain government cubbyholes and corner offices.</p>
<p>For Dunn was no garden variety AG, as governments tend to prefer -- and in some places expect -- but an activist investigator who took his mandate to protect the public seriously.</p>
<p>Right through the last days of his tenure, Dunn's office was at it, doing the people's business, aided by the clarity that comes from a non-partisan perspective. His last fiscal update put the final cost on Alberta's H1N1 vaccination initiative at $148 million, with a pledge for the AG to investigate whether or not the pandemic flu program was handled properly. At the same time, we learned to no one's surprise that personal income tax revenues and natural gas royalty figures were down.</p>
<p>On the other side of the ledger, we were presented with the more cheering news that the downturn has seen the province save money on some capital projects. As well, higher-than-expected conventional and oilsands revenues, additional corporate income tax dollars and an increase in health and social transfers cut back the projected deficit by nearly a billion dollars from last spring's estimates.</p>
<p>Gleaning these facts from a truly independent source, ferreting out flaws and suggesting practical remedies is the essence of an auditor general and essential to any democracy worthy of the name. Fred Dunn was in the top tier among AG's anywhere and his departure will be missed. So will his dry wit, which, to understate it, is not normally associated with people in his line of work. "I have a high regard for colleagues and fellow citizens in Calgary. They are entrepreneurial and they are adventuresome. They're very forward thinking, but dining out should not be a risk-taking venture." Or, on the subject of executive kiss-offs: "There were some payments that were made, let's call them friendly parting gifts."</p>
<p>He often called a spade a spade, providing welcome contrast in a milieu plagued with massaged doublespeak. Local health boards were "regional fiefdoms." Severance packages were "gold plated." On leaving, he allowed that he "at times felt very frustrated and somewhat disappointed. And at times, I felt rather angry. And I thought at those times, when you get to that point, it's time to leave."</p>
<p>It's our loss. Fred Dunn represented the tough, maverick spirit Alberta politicians love to invoke rhetorically, but far too often, fail to embody. Getting up the nose of the powerful and pampered is an absolute requirement for any auditor general. Dunn did it. Let's hope his successor has the same qualities.</p>

<p>Assuming that the question pertains to traditional animal forms used for food, the issue boils down to the production process -- natural versus technology-assisted.</p>
<p>Sikh faith does not preclude the use of human intelligence or technology to improve living conditions or quality of life. Humans have used animal meat for sustenance since time immemorial and it continues to be a significant source of food for humans, even today. However, as modern technologies enable us to sustain ourselves through non-life-destroying means, it makes little sense to kill an animal to feed ourselves.</p>
<p>Sikh faith respects the sanctity of life and is against any avoidable loss of life. Observant Sikhs use pure vegetarian foods only; therefore, meat produced by killing animals or from stem cells makes no difference. As individuals make lifestyle choices, they must be cognizant of the moral considerations and the technological, scientific, economic and societal aspects.</p>
<p>Many of the recent widespread but serious human disorders (mad cow disease, H1N1, etc.) are attributable to humans interfering with natural phenomena to maximize their yields and profits. Countless billions have been spent to insulate ourselves from effects of our own greed, and we deemed it appropriate to destroy many millions of chicken and pigs.</p>
<p>This would not have been necessary if we relied on non-meat sources of food.</p>
<p>Studies show that a thousand tonnes of water is needed to produce one tonne of grain that, in turn, is used to produce eight kilograms of meat. These frightening numbers would be applicable whether stem cell technologies are used or not.</p>
<p>With water and arable land becoming increasingly scarce and potential causes of future wars or famines, it makes economic, moral and social sense to use less demanding and damaging means for human sustenance. Thanks for revolutionary stem-cell research, but let's use it to improve our lives without encouraging harmful practices.</p>
<p>Ajit Singh Sahota is a retired biologist from Agriculture Canada and a founding member of the Sikh National Archives of Canada.</p>

</p>
<p>On a rainy January day, Karen Romo, 15, feeds her five younger brothers and sisters an early dinner and tidies the kitchen while waiting for her father to return from work. One of the children vacuums the living room, manoeuvring around a large box of diapers. Another sibling holds the baby.</p>
<p>When the father, Miguel, arrives home, he's carrying a couple of bags of groceries, enough for a day or two. He rubs his youngest son's head affectionately, and pulls the infant into his arms.</p>
<p>He seems bewildered by the turn his life has taken. "I miss my wife very much," says Miguel, a quiet man who speaks halting English. Looking around the cramped living room, he adds: "She was half my life."</p>
<p>Just inside the door of the two-bedroom, second-floor Santa Ana, Calif., apartment sits a tabletop shrine crowded with devotional candles. The candles depict Our Lady of Guadalupe and the Sacred Heart of Jesus; dried roses droop in a vase. It pays forlorn but faithful tribute to Virginia Romo, the wife and mother who died in July at age 38.</p>
<p>The cause of death was pneumonia, believed to have been a complication of the H1N1 virus she caught last spring at the dawn of the outbreak. One of about 11,000 swine flu deaths nationwide, Romo's in many ways typifies the pandemic. She was young, poor, pregnant and Latina.</p>
<p>"She was always so healthy," says Miguel, 40, who is now raising six children -- ages 15 years to seven months -- on his own. "I don't know what happened. I don't understand."</p>
<p>He gestures to the apartment's homey living room, decorated with elaborate draperies, framed paintings and religious icons. "Virginia did everything for us," he says. "She was always so happy."</p>
<p>As health officials begin to tally the score card from the 2009 pandemic, some facts are becoming clear. The virus was not as lethal as feared; most of the 55 million cases in the U.S. were mild. Nor did it primarily fell the elderly and infants, as most flu viruses do. Instead, swine flu targeted younger adults, with the majority of deaths among people ages 18 to 64.</p>
<p>It saved its worst for pregnant women.</p>
<p>They have been hospitalized at four times the rate of the general population and have died at six times the average rate, according to various estimates. In a study of 63 pregnant women in California who were hospitalized with H1N1 between April 23 and Aug. 11, 61 were so sick they were placed in intensive care. Seventeen died.</p>
<p>"The deaths among pregnant women are devastating. This is supposed to be a great time in their lives. Then the mom dies and the baby survives," says Dr. Janice Louie, chief of the influenza and respiratory diseases section of the California Department of Public Health. She was author of a study, published in January in the New England Journal of Medicine, analysing the effects of H1N1 on pregnant and postpartum women in California.</p>
<p>In many of the lethal cases in pregnant women, the illness struck swiftly, leaving families and widowed husbands in shock. Six months after his wife's death, Miguel still sees reminders of her everywhere. Her prenatal vitamins sit on the kitchen counter.</p>
<p>He manages to care for the children, though he works weekdays at a factory that makes tortilla machines and recently resumed three evening shifts a week as a busboy at a Newport Landing restaurant. A friend of Virginia's who lives with the family cares for the baby, the five-year-old twins and her own two children until Karen comes home from school. When the friend leaves for her job, Karen is in charge until Miguel returns.</p>
<p>"I used to work five or six nights at the restaurant, but now I have to watch the babies," Miguel says as the twins pester him to go out for doughnuts. "My older daughters have to go to school, and they have homework to do."</p>
<p>It's been hard to explain to the twins what has happened, he says.</p>
<p>"At first, I told them their mother was in Mexico. Now, I'm trying to explain it to them, little by little. I tell them, she's with God in the sky. But they still say, 'Where's Mama?' "</p>
<p>A sticker on the door to the family's apartment reads, "Este Hogar es Catolico." This home is Catholic. Devoted to their faith, Miguel and Virginia welcomed every child as a gift from God.</p>
<p>They met as children in the village of San Miguel el Alto in Jalisco, Mexico. Karen was born there. The family moved to Santa Ana where Gabriela, 14; Cristian, 12; and five-year-old twins Giovanni and Yareli were born. In late 2008, Virginia became pregnant again.</p>
<p>For most of her pregnancy, Virginia felt fine. Although she was overweight, she was healthy; she had even quit smoking.</p>
<p>Then, in the late spring, she came down with what appeared to be a bad cold. In mid-June, her cough turned nasty. She complained of chest and back pain. She often lay in bed all day with the lights off instead of bustling around the apartment cleaning. Normally unfazed by the noise in a home with five kids, she asked Karen to keep the children quiet.</p>
<p>She had obtained regular prenatal care with Medi-Cal insurance, and she made a few visits to a physician about her respiratory symptoms. She soon began to complain of shortness of breath. On July 3, one month before the baby was due, Virginia's condition worsened.</p>
<p>"When I got home, my daughter told me to take Virginia to the hospital," Miguel recalls. "Virginia was scared. She said she couldn't breathe."</p>
<p>The couple went to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, and Virginia was admitted at 2 a.m. on July 4, about six weeks after her first symptoms and about 10 days after they became severe. The doctor noted the symptoms on the admission summary: coughing up yellow sputum, fever of 101, shortness of breath. A chest X-ray showed lung congestion.</p>
<p>Doctors gave her oxygen and IV fluids and began to run tests.</p>
<p>"I'm sure this was H1N1," says Virginia's obstetrician, Dr. David Su, of Santa Ana. "H1N1 had just come around. We didn't know which group of people it would hit. It's not like the typical flu. Every year, we have pregnant patients with flu and bronchitis and coughs and colds. They don't usually die."</p>
<p>Early on July 5, Miguel got a call from the hospital. "They said, 'Can you be here in 10 minutes? We have to do surgery right away,' " Miguel recalls. He rushed to the hospital. Virginia had gone into acute respiratory distress. The baby was delivered in an emergency caesarean section, a few weeks premature but at five pounds, eight ounces otherwise healthy. Virginia was intubated and taken to intensive care.</p>
<p>"These women are so sick, a lot of them have to be delivered in the ICU," Louie said of the H1N1 pregnancy cases. "As the fetus grows, it pushes up on the lungs, and a pregnant woman has less room to expand. This predisposes them to not being able to cough as well."</p>
<p>Hormones and the immune system also change during pregnancy, which makes it harder for pregnant women like Virginia to fight infection. Further, statistics released by the state Department of Public Health show that in California, Latinos have been twice as likely as whites to die from H1N1, in part because they have less access to healthcare and are more likely to have other chronic health problems or wait longer to seek help.</p>
<p>Virginia was rarely conscious after being admitted to the hospital. Over the next few weeks, doctors diagnosed pneumonia and gave her antibiotics and the antiviral drug Tamiflu, which is recommended for H1N1 treatment in pregnant women as well as other patients. She had aggressive lung treatments and was placed in a bed that could be rotated to turn her upside down, creating more room in her lungs and allowing mucus to dislodge.</p>
<p>"We gave her everything; it just got worse and worse," Su says. "The lung tissue was just shot."</p>
<p>Several mornings a week, Miguel would drop Karen off at the hospital and she would spend the day at her mother's bedside.</p>
<p>"It was so hard to see her there. I would talk to her and just hope she would be listening to me," Karen says. "I would tell her, 'The baby is fine; just get better.' "</p>
<p>Virginia died alone early on July 22.</p>
<p>Six days later, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its first bulletin alerting doctors to an increased risk of complications among pregnant women with H1N1.</p>
<p>The baby -- Virginia -- is beautiful. Everyone says so. She's a good baby, Karen says. She only fusses a little now and then because she's teething. The children vie for turns holding her.</p>
<p>Karen recalls how thrilled her mother was at the prospect of another child. She has resolved to make sure her baby sister knows this.</p>
<p>"When she took the pregnancy test, she was so happy," Karen recalls. "She said it was probably her last baby because of her age."</p>
<p>As she waits for her father on this rainy day, Karen sweeps rice and Froot Loops off the plates, washes them and places them in the dish rack. She opens the door and yells to the younger children to stay out of the street. It's sunset, the showers have stopped, and food vending trucks selling tortillas and candy are lining up at the curb.</p>
<p>A good athlete, Karen had wanted to play softball after school this spring, but now that's not possible. She still manages to get good marks in her 10th-grade classes and loves science and math.</p>
<p>Someday, she says, she would like to be a midwife.</p>
