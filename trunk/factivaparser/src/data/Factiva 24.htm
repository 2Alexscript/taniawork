<p>Why hasn't anyone asked the tough question of Premier Ed Stelmach, Health Minister Ron Liepert, and Alberta Health Services CEO Stephen Duckett:When did they receive their H1N1 vaccination? Did they have to stand in line with the great unwashed, or did Alberta Health Services send someone to their offices? Which high risk group did they fall into?</p>

<p>Some important lessons have been learned in this H1N1 vaccination fiasco. My deepest fear is that those who need to learn from it are not.</p>
<p>The lessons are: AHS needed to have a solid plan, and a contingency plan in case the first plan did not work. This is what happened. The vaccine producers failed to provide the promised amounts, and Albertans showed themselves unable to wait patiently for high-risk groups to be vaccinated first. This should have been anticipated months ago, which would have prevented the frustrating suspension of the vaccination program.</p>
<p>AHS and the government did not manage media relations competently. They should have done more to explain that "pandemic" refers to geographical spread, rather than the seriousness of the disease. This may have mitigated much of the panic experienced by people.</p>
<p>AHS has erroneously relied on their poorly designed website to direct all inquiries. Most people gained their information from the media.</p>
<p>AHS set up too few clinics in too few places or the wrong places for too short time periods that prevented working parents getting their children to clinics after school.</p>
<p>Should we hope that AHS will be fast learners? Not if the latest edict is any indication. Today, children under five years of age are to be targeted. Tomorrow, pregnant women will have their turn. There are no exceptions to this rule. What proportion of women with young children are likely to be pregnant again?Does it make sense to force these mothers to make two trips?</p>
<p>With luck, few people will die from H1N1.It will make people miserable. And ultimately, it will erode Albertans' confidence in the ability of AHS to plan for and manage future pandemics.</p>

<p>The names of the Calgary Flames and their families who received the H1N1 vaccine are easy targets in these days of finger-pointing and hysteria.</p>
<p>What I would like to know are the names of MLAs from all parties who received the vaccine before high-risk Albertans did. Surely some of these politicians did not fit the criteria.</p>

<p>It is hypocritical for Conservative voters in this province to be outraged by Calgary Flames players jumping the queue for the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>As long as I have lived in Alberta, the only comprehensive health-care efforts made by this government have been to kneecap the public system to introduce more private insurance and private delivery of health services. Under those circumstances, it is perfectly acceptable for the ultra rich to get what they want, while the rest of us shiver in line.</p>

<p>Everyone is in an uproar over the Calgary Flames receiving the H1N1 vaccine. Why?</p>
<p>They received the vaccine when the clinics were still open to the public. I see nothing wrong with that. They didn't receive preferential treatment. They may not have been the highest-risk group, but the government was allowing anyone and everyone to get the vaccine, so who is really in the wrong here?</p>
<p>I think it is good that the Flames are vaccinated because they travel a lot and they come into contact with a lot of people. It makes sense.</p>
<p>The players' families were also vaccinated and I don't see what is wrong with that either. Jarome Iginla has three children (ages one, three, and five) and they are at risk, so why is the public so angry?</p>
<p>I think we should focus on other things and not get so mad over a situation blown way out proportion.</p>

<p>Re: "Flames ignite vaccine furor; Province investigates how team, families jumped queue for flu shots," The Journal, Nov. 4.</p>
<p>To say I am appalled is just too little. Our sports teams mean so much to our cities that road repair must wait, we can't feed our homeless, or find beautiful missing women. But rest assured, hockey will go on!</p>
<p>As a chronic pain suffer, I couldn't stand in line for four hours for my shot. I am in the age group 35-45 and a woman most at risk. But I am surely happy hockey players are safe. I may not be live, but they will. Tell my kids the reason for that!</p>

</div><div>Graham Thomson   </div>

<p>It should come as no surprise the swine flu has finally claimed its first political victim.</p>
<p>And it should also come as no surprise that the victim is not Health Minister Ron Liepert nor Chief Medical Officer Andre Corriveau nor Alberta Health Services CEO Stephen Duckett.</p>
<p>In a political crisis, the most vulnerable is usually the faceless, expendable bureaucrat.The higher ups are inoculated by their proximity to power.</p>
<p>In this case, the victim was the health-care official who's being blamed for releasing the swine flu vaccine to members of the Calgary Flames and their families.</p>
<p>As I write this, the official's name is being withheld, like something you'd do until the next of kin are notified. The government would prefer the bureaucrat be wheeled out the back door with as little fuss as possible. Details are sketchy about what happened. But then a lot of things about the government's flu pandemic response are sketchy.</p>
<p>I have to admit to having some sympathy for the unnamed health official if he or she was simply trying to follow the mixed messages about who should be immunized: "I urge all Albertans to go out and get immunized"( Liepert on Monday of last week); "We would encourage those who are not at high risk to be patient and wait" (Liepert on Friday).</p>
<p>You would have thought at least by now the health minister's messages would be crystal clear. They're not.</p>
<p>On Monday this week, Liepert tried to counter opposition accusations of incompetence by listing off those high-risk groups who have been immunized. "The homeless have been vaccinated," said Liepert. "I can tell you that our aboriginal population has been vaccinated." And then, in an attempt to shut down NDP Leader Brian Mason, Liepert added, "Every health-care worker in this province who wanted to get vaccinated has been vaccinated."</p>
<p>Within moments, reporters asked health department officials if indeed "our aboriginal population" has been vaccinated--and were told that, uh, no, that's not really the case. Some reserves have seen 90-per-cent vaccination rates but other reserves are much lower. No details were available.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Liepert had to do some backtracking. The assertion that "every" willing health-care worker in Alberta has been vaccinated was watered down to "every health-care worker will have the opportunity to be vaccinated." The assertion that "the homeless have been vaccinated" was modified to "we are also continuing our vaccinations wherever possible with our homeless community."</p>
<p>Liberal Leader David Swann accused Liepert of misleading the house and demanded he be fired.</p>
<p>Stelmach, predictably, refused.</p>
<p>But you have to wonder if Liepert will eventually be a political victim of the swine flu. Perhaps not today, but a few months from now when the swine flu is an unpleasant memory and Liepert suddenly decides he'd be much happier as minister of Sustainable Resource Development.</p>
<p>If not Liepert, then perhaps it will be Corriveau who suddenly develops a case of resignitis.</p>
<p>Somebody has to take the blame for having Albertans wait in line for hours for a flu shot that the government urged them to get. And somebody should take the blame for having the vaccination clinics shut down for four days in the middle of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Liepert obviously doesn't feel like he's responsible for the confusion, repeatedly saying he was just following the advice of health-care officials. But in the health-care system, Liepert is the ultimate authority, not Corriveau. And it is Liepert's credibility that is key to the government's still ill-defined plans to reform the health-care system.</p>
<p>It was Liepert who shut down the old regional health boards and opened up the new, superboard which had--as its first big test-- the swine flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Right now, Liepert's credibility gap is the Grand Canyon of Alberta politics. They could give helicopter tours.</p>
<p>That's not good news for Stelmach as he heads into a mandatory leadership review at the Conservative's annual convention in Red Deer on Saturday. Nobody is predicting Stelmach will lose outright. Some government MLAs are worried, though, he might get a poor enough rating that he'll be fighting off internal attacks until the next election in two years or so.</p>
<p>However, Stelmach could face problems even if his party rallies behind him in a big way and gives him, say, 85-per-cent support. That would be completely out of step with the views of average Albertans. According to a new opinion poll, support for the Stelmach's government has fallen to 34 per cent of decided voters (with the results considered accurate within 3.1 percentage points).</p>
<p>If Stelmach was to win an overwhelming thumbs-up from his party while the public is giving him a thumbs-down, that would demonstrate a massive credibility gap between Alberta Conservatives and Alberta voters. That might drive more disgruntled conservative supporters to the Wildrose Alliance which, according to the poll, jumped in support to 28 per cent of decided voters.</p>
<p>If this trend continues, the ultimate political victim of the swine flu and other government missteps could yet be Ed Stelmach.</p>

</p>
<p>Tuesday, in defending the provincial government's latest about-face in H1N1 vaccine distribution, Alberta's chief medical officer Andre Corriveau described finally targeting children and pregnant women as a "no-brainer."</p>
<p>You'd think those responsible for the confusing mess that the flu shot program has become would be wise to avoid such dangerous talk.</p>
<p>For brainpower has been in little evidence with the conflicting signals that have been sent from the provincial leadership pledged to protect Albertans.</p>
<p>It is easy--and predictable for governments of all stripes everywhere --to wax rhapsodic about readiness and noble intentions. But in these parts, we pride ourselves on performance, not jumped-up rhetoric. We were told that Alberta was prepared to smoothly handle an H1N1 vaccination program, and most of us assumed that would be the case. The cynics have been proven right to some degree--and there is no joy in that for anyone.</p>
<p>It is true enough that there have been problems in other jurisdictions, beginning with Ottawa.</p>
<p>Most Canadians also trusted that the federal government would carry out its part of the bargain, in securing safe supply and sending out solid information. Clearly, there have been serious flaws in its execution and messaging as well. Placing all our vaccine orders with a single Quebec company without a backup hedge seems to have been a mistake. News reports that manufacturer <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> is actually exporting antigen abroad while Canadians have been stuck in long lineups is little short of infuriating. GSK is sending off some 436,000 doses across the country this week, which is considerably short of the roughly two million doses expected.</p>
<p>And although federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq has generally been a refreshing presence in the Harper cabinet, her department's sundry missives over the months haven't always inspired confidence, either. And that is interesting, since for most Canadians, the questions at hand have been rather straightforward.</p>
<p>How serious is the H1N1 virus and what is its projected timetable?Who is most at risk?Who should be inoculated first?Why can't we go to our physicians or at least a wider variety of venues for a shot? Why isn't there proper supply when everyone knew the virus would come back? Why can't governments co-ordinate their acts together? Isn't there an alternative to interminably long queues? What about allergic reactions to the vaccine?</p>
<p>There are those who say the virus will peak by the end of next week. Since the vaccine takes days to kick in, need we panic about getting a dose when and if a supply becomes available for everyone? Is all of this a massive hype? We're still asking the same questions, even though the usually sensible Canadian consensus has been better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>While again affirming that there have been glitches elsewhere, it's only natural that we look for trouble and assign blame first at home. Alas, there has been no shortage of material to work with courtesy of the Stelmach Conservatives.</p>
<p>For the past few days, while other Canadians have been getting their shots, Albertans alone have been shut out.</p>
<p>Speaking of outrages, Tuesday's revelation that Calgary Flames players, staff and family members received special treatment only adds to the cynicism. We await other skates to drop around the country.</p>
<p>In fact, the problems began long ago. It borders on the incredible that Health Minister Ron Liepert would claim that there have been no planning gaffes. How could he possibly say that, given the patent contradictions with himself and Corriveau maintaining that the focus would (properly)be on high-risk Albertans first, at the same time the premier was declaring loudly that no one would be turned away?Are we meant to blame the worried seniors and families who lined up first?</p>
<p>Now that small children and pregnant women will be the only ones able to receive vaccine, what of the other Albertans in high-risk categories who will be denied protection until supplies for the rest of the population arrive?</p>
<p>Rumours are circulating that the government is quietly blaming the shemozzle on the health bureaucracy. Given the dramas that have surrounded public health ranks in the province, there could well be some truth in this. But then, who is ultimately responsible for that? Pathological buck-passing has been a leitmotif of the Stelmach regime since its inception, and so it continues on.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the broader, and far more serious fears associated with the government's program of health-care reform. Let us remind again that this huge, potentially admirable initiative was never mentioned during the last provincial election. No one knew that regional health boards would be scrapped in favour of a single authority, for example.</p>
<p>When it comes to sending out mixed messages, the flu vaccine fiasco might be seen as simply more of the same. In an overall sense, we haven't a clue what sort of planning is underway, and if there is an understanding of the consequences involved. Time and time again in the key health file, the messages have been murky instead of the straight talk and buck-stops-here accountability we were promised. At the sign of serious friction, decisions are reversed. The fault always seems to lie elsewhere.</p>
<p>Few of the legitimate questions Albertans are asking can be seen as political or ideological. Voters massively selected the Stelmach government in a recent election and have shown little faith in the alternatives to date. The rubs haven't been matters of philosophy, however opposition politicians might muse aloud, but of sheer managerial competence and public transparency.</p>
<p>You wonder how delegates to this weekend's Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta convention are feeling this week. Many are hearing loud complaints from their constituents, and the latest H1N1 miscues can't help. Ed Stelmach must be wondering what sort of vaccine his government needs to prevent a further slide.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Long-gun registry about to be unloaded</b>
</div><div>Janice Tibbetts; With a file from Mike De Souza   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>532 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>MPs voted by a clear margin Wednesday to repeal the federal long-gun registry, signalling for the first time since the program was adopted 14 years ago that it is headed for the scrap heap, despite police assertions that it saves lives.</p>
<p>A private member's bill, sponsored by Conservative backbencher Candice Hoeppner, had the backing of all the Tories, from Prime Minister Stephen Harper down, and enough opposition MPs to clear its first major hurdle of winning support in principle.</p>
<p>The bill passed by a surprising 164-137, winning more supporters than expected as 12 New Democrats, eight Liberals and one Independent cast their votes with the government.</p>
<p>No Bloc Quebecois MPs voted in favour of the bill.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation now moves to an all-party committee for public hearings before it returns to the House of Commons for a final vote and then heads to the Senate.</p>
<p>"It's step one but there is still a lot of work to do," Hoeppner said outside the Commons after her bill passed second reading.</p>
<p>The bill would only end the long-gun portion of the registry, eliminating the need to register rifles and shotguns. The requirement to register handguns would remain in place.</p>
<p>If the bill makes it through Parliament, it would mean the dismantling of eight million firearms records, say police.</p>
<p>The registry has been the source of many court battles, bitter party infighting between rural and urban MPs, political rhetoric--and a scathing 2002 report from the federal auditor general that found that final tab to implement the program would ring in at more than $1 billion, dramatically more than the $2-million original estimate.</p>
<p>The Harper government, which has strong rural support, has introduced legislation to kill the registry, but the bill has languished due to a lack of opposition support and government will to propel it through Parliament. MPs are normally permitted to break ranks from the party line for private member's bills, giving Hoeppner's initiative enough support from dissident MPs to succeed, even though the three opposition parties officially support the gun registry.</p>
<p>Pressure was on MPs to show up and the Commons was packed, with 301 of 304 casting votes--including a Bloc Quebecois MP who was wearing a mask because he suspects that he has the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Supporters and opponents have campaigned nationwide in recent weeks in an attempt to sway the outcome of the vote, lobbying in newspapers, on radio and in the hallways on Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>The Conservatives backed radio ads urging Canadians in swing ridings to call their MPs to voice their opposition to the registry.</p>
<p>The registry was adopted 14 years ago by the former Liberal government as part of a wider gun-control package, largely due to lobbying from the families who lost daughters in the 1989 Montreal massacre, when Marc Lepine used a semi-automatic rifle to kill 14 women at Ecole Polytechnique. Mothers of victims have campaigned relentlessly in the last week to preserve the registry as a vital component of gun control.</p>

</div><div>Trish Audette   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal; With files from Canwest News Services</div>
<div>686 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Alberta's auditor general may examine how the province is delivering swine flu vaccinations.</p>
<p>Fred Dunn said his department is currently reviewing how such an investigation would take place-- perhaps in co-operation with other provincial and federal auditors general-- and what the timeline would be.</p>
<p>"We're at the planning stage. This clearly is one of the items which are right in front," he said.</p>
<p>"Should we do it only in Alberta... or should we do it as a collaborative audit across multi-jurisdictions?"</p>
<p>Dunn was prompted to talk about the potential investigation during an all-party meeting of MLAs Wednesday morning, when NDP Leader Brian Mason urged the auditor general's office to do a special report.</p>
<p>Mason questioned the Stelmach government's ability to meet the goal of immunizing all Albertans who want the H1N1 vaccine by Christmas, and suggested Dunn's investigation could be launched in the new year.</p>
<p>"I do think that it's very important that we do get a good solid look at how this was rolled out," Mason said.</p>
<p>When the province first launched mass immunization clinics across the province last week, there were widespread complaints of lineups that were too long. By the weekend, it was clear Alberta was at risk of running out of doses of the H1N1 vaccine. Clinics were shut down. Specialized clinics are expected to reopen today, focusing first on young children and then moving on to other high-risk groups.</p>
<p>Government backbench MLAs who sit on the public accounts committee suggested it was too soon for the auditor general to take a look at the immunization plan.</p>
<p>"I don't think we need to get into this. I think Mr. Mason is just trying to add to the hysteria," Edmonton-Beverly-Clareview Conservative MLA Tony Vandermeer said.</p>
<p>Vandermeer said the shortage of vaccine doses was the result of the province's "successful campaign.</p>
<p>"You roll with the punches, doing the best you can. In this situation, we're doing the best we can."</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert said he would not pre-judge the process.</p>
<p>"The auditor general is independent and he has the authority to look at any part of government that he so chooses," Liepert said. "We have nothing to hide."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it was confirmed that some Alberta vaccine had to be tossed out Saturday night after nurses mixed the doses in preparation for next-day clinics, only to have Sunday's clinics ordered closed. As 10-dose supplies are mixed to create individual shots, they last only 24 hours.</p>
<p>Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services, said the waste was minimal, since every effort was made to use the mixed doses. Nurses went around to clinic staff at the end of the day to make sure they had received their vaccinations.</p>
<p>In general, about two per cent of Alberta's vaccines have been wasted. That amounts to about 8,000 doses out of the 400,000 the province has given out.</p>
<p>The federal government said Wednesday the supply of vaccine available for next week is expected to be 1.8 million doses nationally, something which came as unexpected news to some provincial health authorities who have been eagerly awaiting the number. Under attack from the opposition parties during the daily question period in Ottawa, Prime Minister Stephen Harper shared the estimate and said the next shipment will mean more than eight million doses will have been delivered to the provinces and territories.</p>
<p>Health officials in London, Ont., announced that a two-month-old baby boy who died there Wednesday likely had the H1N1 flu. It's believed to be the first death of an infant, possibly related to swine flu, in the province.</p>

<p>The federal H1N1 flu vaccination campaign continues to roll out for everyone in Alberta's 44 First Nations communities.</p>
<p>Overall, approximately 35 per cent of those on-reserve received their vaccine in the first week, Health Canada said. Some communities saw coverage rates close to 90 per cent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as of Tuesday, approximately 50,000 health-care workers had been vaccinated.</p>
<p>While there are 90,000 in the province, a health official said not all are front-line workers in contact with patients, who are the most at risk of getting sick.</p>

</div><div>Jodie Sinnema, With files from Paula Simons, Archie McLean
and Karen Kleiss   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>1355 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Alberta's health superboard has fired a mid-level manager involved in releasing H1N1 vaccine to the Calgary Flames and their families instead of saving the shots for those at risk of becoming dangerously ill.</p>
<p>"Like most Albertans, I am deeply offended that this circumstance has occurred," said a statement signed by Ken Hughes, board chairman of Alberta Health Services, and Stephen Duckett, CEO and president.</p>
<p>"AHS board and management have a fundamental commitment to serve all Albertans according to their needs, in medical priority. This circumstance was a clear departure from that principle. We set the expectation that this should not have happened and should not happen again."</p>
<p>The name and position of the staff member were not released.</p>
<p>The investigation, which is expected to wrap up today, will determine if more staff need to be disciplined. Investigators with the health board determined the Flames management thought the special clinic had been approved by Alberta Health Services.</p>
<p>The Edmonton Oilers requested no such clinic.</p>
<p>"The special treatment for the Flames and their families is unacceptable to us and contrary to all of our existing protocols and processes," Duckett said in the statement. "I apologize for this breach of our duty to Albertans."</p>
<p>Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services, said he thinks the queuejumping incident was isolated.</p>
<p>"We're reasonably certain but again, nothing is 100 per cent, so we have taken every precaution we can to control the supply of vaccine and to just ensure it goes to our clinics," Predy said.</p>
<p>He said the provincial health department receives the vaccination from Health Canada, then distributes it to Alberta Health Services, which is in charge of the vaccination campaign. So far, Predy said, Health Services has supplied vaccine only to the mass clinics, to hospitals where health-care workers are being inoculated and to some primary care networks, in which teams of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health professionals work. Those vaccinations are meant for the team members, not the public.</p>
<p>No special clinics were set up to inoculate politicians, Predy said, so those who received their shots stood in line like everyone else. None of the 17 cabinet ministers or three party leaders contacted Wednesday by The Journal had received vaccinations.</p>
<p>Nurses, doctors and others must supply identification to get their in-hospital shots. And now that Alberta is experiencing a vaccine shortage, only those who work face-to-face with patients will be eligible, said Predy, who has not received the vaccine. Supplies are now being saved for children older than six months and under five years, as well as pregnant women.</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, received his vaccine in the Northwest Territories last week, where his family lives.</p>
<p>"I waited in line like everybody else," Corriveau said.</p>
<p>He said no private clinics have received the vaccine, despite suggestions that one in Calgary told its members they would have access to the shot in mid-November as part of their membership fees.</p>
<p>"Maybe that's part of an old marketing plan, but the plans have changed since last week," Corriveau said. "This vaccine is in short supply around the world, and so in Canada, it's distributed exclusively to the provinces who then redistribute it to the health authorities."</p>
<p>Corriveau said all requests to set up separate clinics--other than the one for the Calgary Flames, which he knew nothing about--were turned down.</p>
<p>The Edmonton Police Commission sent a letter to Alberta's health minister and the solicitor general requesting priority access to the vaccine for officers, arguing they are first responders and their work is essential to minimize social disruption during a pandemic. The government never responded.</p>
<p>"We feel police are every bit as much front-line workers as health-care workers are," acting commission chairman Bob Dunster said. "They have hands-on dealings with the public and put themselves and their families at risk."</p>
<p>Taxi drivers are also clamouring for access to the vaccine. United Cabbies Association of Alberta president Balraj Manhas said he is receiving dozens of calls daily from drivers who are concerned about their routine contact with the public.</p>
<p>"We take people from home to clinics and hospitals and back, and sometimes people need help in and out of the vehicle," he said, noting the group represents roughly 800 city cabbies.</p>
<p>"Cab drivers are not refusing to take people to get medical care, but we are concerned. We feel we are among the high-risk groups."</p>
<p>In British Columbia, Dr. Perry Kendall, the chief provincial health officer, said his office will be investigating to see how members of the Calgary Flames farm team, the Abbotsford Heat, were able to obtain flu shots on Tuesday evening, hours after the Flames apologized for accepting their vaccines ahead of other Albertans.</p>
<p>B.C. has been limiting access to H1N1 vaccine only to pregnant women, children under five years of age, those with serious chronic health conditions, and those who care for infants under six months.</p>
<p>However, private physicians with their own practices have been able to requisition vaccine specifically for high-risk patients who met those strict criteria. Kendall says his office will be interviewing the Heat's team physician to determine if the team got its vaccine that way.</p>
<p>In a statement released Wednesday, Abbotsford Heat president Tom Mauthe said the team's physician had assessed "most of the playing complement" as "high-risk" and vaccinated them at his clinic, along with other "high-risk" patients.</p>
<p>"At no time did anyone from the Abbotsford Heat receive preferential treatment, nor did they jump a queue," Mauthe said.</p>
<p>Mark Ammann, a researcher with the Health Law Institute at the University of Alberta, said any queuejumping will inevitably impact public trust.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that members of the public have every right to be suspicious after something like this," Ammann said. "There's always a bit of an underlying concern in Canadian health care about whether there are individuals who are wealthier or privileged may receive better access to care, when theoretically the Canadian system is based on equal access based on need."</p>
<p>Even though the Flames received their vaccines before the province tightened eligibility requirements, Ammann suspects the staff member involved likely knew the vaccine shortage was on the horizon.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert called the Flames' vaccinations unfortunate. He commended Alberta Health Services for dealing quickly with the situation. "It sends the message that this will not be tolerated."</p>
<p>Liepert was on the defensive Wednesday in question period. For the third day in a row, he fended off repeated calls from the Liberals for him to resign over his handling of the flu vaccine. Wildrose Alliance MLA Paul Hinman also called for Liepert's ouster.</p>

<p>ALBERTA NUMBERS ON THE RISE</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada has published a summary of its most up-to-date statistics on H1N1 cases in Canada. The data covers up to Oct. 24. - The agency said national numbers of new hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths reported the week of Oct. 18-24 were approximately three times higher than the previous week. - In Alberta, the difference was even more pronounced. - During the week of Oct. 18-24, Alberta has 44 hospitalized cases and four deaths. The week before there were six hospitalizations and no deaths in Alberta. - The report also noted that people with underlying medical conditions represented 62 per cent of the national hospitalized cases, 73 per cent of cases admitted to intensive care units, and 80 per cent of the deaths. - Alberta Health and Wellness had posted statistics on its website as recently as this past weekend that said, "Known underlying conditions are present in 76 per cent of hospitalized cases and 93 per cent of deaths." That statement has now been changed to "Known underlying conditions are present in the majority of hospitalized cases and deaths."</p>

</p>
<p>Just days before Premier Ed Stelmach faces a leadership review at his party's annual convention, a new Environics poll conducted for The Journal and the Calgary Herald suggests Albertans are deserting the Conservatives in droves in favour of the Wildrose Alliance.</p>
<p>Across the province, 34 per cent of decided voters say they support the Tories, down from 55 per cent a year ago.</p>
<p>The Wildrose party, under new leader Danielle Smith, is now the solid second choice of Albertans, with 28 per cent support. The Liberals have the support of 20 per cent and the NDP nine. Despite being deregistered by Elections Alberta, the Green Party polled at eight per cent.</p>
<p>The numbers suggest the Wildrose Alliance is particularly strong in Calgary, polling 34 per cent among decided voters, compared to 30 per cent for the Tories.</p>
<p>The Wildrose appears to have considerably less support in</p>
<p>Edmonton, where it polled in third place, with 17 per cent of decided voters. The Conservatives polled at 34 per cent support, the Liberals 27 and the NDP at 13 per cent.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted between Oct. 19 and 31, asked 1,000 Albertans for whom they would vote if an election was held today.</p>
<p>The results appear to confirm the talk in coffee shops and hockey rinks across the province-- that people are losing faith in the party that has held power since 1971. The numbers suggest the governing Tories have sunk to their lowest popular support since December 1993, when they dipped to 32 per cent, according to Environics pollster Tony Coulson.</p>
<p>He said the shrinking numbers for the Conservatives are symptomatic of a faltering Alberta economy, and an erosion of the core support for the party.</p>
<p>"It really does look like the right (is) separating," Coulson said. "The wild card now is the Wildrose Alliance. Calgary has been sending the province a message on a pretty regular basis, so this is just another reflection of that disillusionment."</p>
<p>The Wildrose won a byelection in Calgary in September, with former leader Paul Hinman taking a seat vacated after Stelmach's onetime deputy premier resigned.</p>
<p>Outside the major cities, 38 per cent of decided voters say they would cast ballots for the PCs, 32 per cent for the Wildrose party and 15 per cent for the Liberals.</p>
<p>PERCENTAGE OF DECIDED VOTERS - Poll conducted for The Journal and the Calgary Herald by <span class="companylink">Environics Research Group</span> - 1,000 Albertans aged 18 and older were surveyed between Oct. 19 and 31 - Provincewide results are considered accurate within 3.1 percentage points, 95 times out of 100</p>
<p>Numbers in rural areas reflect "bitterness and concern" about the government's decision to revamp its oil and gas royalty plan to collect more revenue, Coulson said.</p>
<p>The survey also comes as the government grapples with its controversial rollout of the H1N1 flu vaccine, which has seen Stelmach and his cabinet assailed for long lineups and few inoculation clinics.</p>
<p>The government was forced to close clinics on the weekend due to vaccine shortages, and will reopen them today only for high-risk patients.</p>
<p>The provincial government's approval rating also sits at a 16-year low, with 36 per cent of voters happy with how the Tories are running the province, and 54 per cent disapproving of their performance. Ten per cent didn't know or refused to answer.</p>
<p>Peter McCormick, a political scientist at the University of Lethbridge, said the Tories' sliding support is a reflection of growing discontent with government decision-making and a perceived lack of leadership from the premier.</p>
<p>"They are not doing a good job of governing the province just now, and Stelmach is not doing a good job of leading," McCormick said. "That's the problem the Tories have created for themselves."</p>
<p>Former premier Ralph Klein and some political observers have argued Stelmach needs about 70 per cent support this weekend to fend off calls for a leadership contest.</p>
<p>Coulson noted the economic downturn--one that has cost tens of thousands of jobs--has also seen the government go from big surpluses to a record deficit.</p>
<p>"The government is struggling so much because of the economy," he said.</p>
<p>The approval ratings and voting preferences uncovered in the Environics poll are consistent with numbers from an October poll conducted by Return on Insight of Calgary.</p>
<p>McCormick thinks the Conservatives will be most worried about their eroding rural support, which has propelled them to victory during their 38-year reign over Alberta.</p>
<p>"The rural ridings have always been the ace in the hole for the Conservatives," McCormick said.</p>
<p>"That's why in some ways the Alliance is their nightmare; it's a right-wing party with strong rural appeal."</p>
<p>He cautioned, however, that the numbers reflect a snapshot in time, and said it will be difficult for the Wildrose Alliance to maintain the momentum into the next provincial election, likely in 2012.</p>
<p>Chaldeans Mensah, a political scientist at Grant MacEwan University, said the government must take the poll seriously, but noted opinion surveys weren't too flattering for the Conservatives in the lead-up to their landslide 2008 election victory.</p>
<p>"It shows increased level of public discontent about the direction and performance of the government," Mensah said. "There's a new political force that is potentially threatening to the Tories."</p>
<p>The Environics poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, 95 times out of 100. In the regional breakdowns, the margin of error is 6.2 percentage points in the major cities and 5.6 for the rest of Alberta.</p>
<p>Of the 1,000 people surveyed across the province, 16 per cent said they were undecided.</p>

</p>
<p>I've been fighting a cold for some days now, fighting it with OJ and hot tea, with vitamin C and taking it easy; as usual, the cold is winning.</p>
<p>In a departure from the usual, though, I'm mad about this cold. Mad at the red-nosed woman in the seat behind me on the train from Ottawa to Montreal last week, who took time out from coughing her way through the two-hour trip only to blow her nose as she tapped away at her laptop.</p>
<p>Mad at the waiter in the hotel breakfast room in Ottawa who sneezed all over the coffee station. Mad at the girl sitting to my left on a jammed airplane the week before for wiping her dripping nose with her sleeve all the way down to Orlando. And mad at colleagues who don't think coughing up mucus is something they should do in the privacy of their own homes.</p>
<p>I never used to feel this aggressive toward people for being out and about with their cold or flu viruses. But I've been laid low too often by what I take to be a complete absence of consideration on their part.</p>
<p>And the reporting these past months about the H1N1 pandemic, I confess, has turned me into a more frightened, cautious version of myself. I envision germs dispersing through the droplets in people's sneezes and coughs and wish I could duck them. I wash my hands so often the skin is raw, use alcohol-based sanitizer furiously and keep my hands away from my face to try to keep germs from spreading. An e-mail on H1N1 prevention making the rounds counsels twice-daily gargles with warm salt water, and I can't see the harm in that. Before too long, I expect to have the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>I get that people think others depend on them and they have to turn up at work even when they're sick. But I believe they're wrong, that they'd be surprised by the length of the list of co-workers who, like me, would prefer they stayed home.</p>
<p>Some people don't have paid sick days, I know, or are afraid of losing their jobs if they don't report for work. Seems to me that going to work with a plugged head and taking on the risk of getting even sicker or infecting those around you is pretty shortsighted. Still, bills and fear are powerful motivators; if I were in either of those camps, I confess I might consider working sick, too.</p>
<p>Yet, many who choose to go into work even when they're under the weather are people whose jobs are in no danger, people who would be paid anyway. Recent surveys have shown many people say they frequently go to work when they feel sick. Results of a poll made public this month, for instance, show that more than 25 per cent of Quebecers surveyed said they would continue to go to work if they had the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Andrew Simor, head of microbiology and infectious diseases at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, said the poll illustrates a workplace culture that rewards a work-at-all-costs attitude-- and discourages people from taking sick time.</p>
<p>"I don't think organizations as a whole have done an awful lot to emphasize the importance of the healthy workplace--quite the opposite," he said. "The history and the culture we have is that you're a bit of a wimp if you take time off from work because you're sick. . . . In light of the pandemic, I think people should be re-thinking that."</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I used to be one of those people. I thought staying home was a sign of weakness, believed there was something commendable about going to work even though I really wanted to be at home, under a blanket, drinking hot tea with honey. An exaggerated sense of obligation, prompted, perhaps, by an inflated perception of my value to the organization, was one reason, I suspect; as well, I was reluctant to take into account the potential effect of my actions on others in my sphere.</p>
<p>No longer. I see clearly now that we're not nearly as productive when we work sick, that there's a better-than-good chance we'll set into motion a cycle that risks making the people around us ill. And generous as I like to think I am as a person, I'm thinking nobody wants me to be generous with my germs.</p>

</p>
<p>As a front-line worker in our province's health-care system, Gordon Laird could be excused for wanting to jump the queue for his H1N1 shot. But unlike doctors, nurses and other medical staff at the hospital he's called home the better part of the past six months, he didn't get the chance.</p>
<p>"I waited eight hours in line last week with my four-year-old," says the father of two.</p>
<p>While the rest of us may fret and fuss over a missed day's work for such a wait, those eight hours took Laird away from his full-time job that comes with no salary: caring round-the-clock for his eight-year-old son Addison, who has logged close to 150 days as an in-patient at the Alberta Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>Addison, who was diagnosed with leukemia at age four, underwent a bone-marrow transplant in May.</p>
<p>Because of his severely compromised immune system, he can't be around other kids for the time being, including his baby brother.</p>
<p>Contracting even the regular seasonal flu from a visitor could prove fatal.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services set up in-hospital H1N1 clinics for those high-risk inpatients who were healthy enough to get the vaccine, as well as for the staff who treat and care for kids like Addison.</p>
<p>But they forgot the most important employees of all: parents.</p>
<p>No one in government thought to provide an in-hospital vaccination program for the immediate families, who are near those vulnerable kids from the time they wake up in the morning until they go to bed at night.</p>
<p>Laird reluctantly agreed to speak with me on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>"It's embarrassing to state the obvious," he says, referring to the latest misstep in the province's handling of the H1N1 vaccination crisis.</p>
<p>He admits his decision to speak out on behalf of the hundreds of families like him in southern Alberta was prompted by revelations of queue jumping by pro hockey players.</p>
<p>The Herald broke the news Tuesday that the Calgary Flames, along with their wives and children, were given their own vaccine "clinic" courtesy of Alberta Health Services.</p>
<p>They jumped the long, long lines ahead of the elderly and other high-risk groups, our city's firefighters and bus drivers, and now, it seems, the primary caregivers of children fighting for their lives at the Alberta Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>But Laird, a writer and author whose work focusing on social justice has won him two National Magazine Awards, feels no bitterness toward Jarome and company for their blatant queue jumping.</p>
<p>"You have to ask why pro athletes were given the option, but not the families of immune-suppressed children in hospital," he says with a calm voice. "I'm not speaking against the Flames-- they didn't put themselves at the front of the line, the system put them there."</p>
<p>No does he harbour any ill will toward the Alberta Children's Hospital, an institution he says has saved his son's life several times.</p>
<p>He says the hospital "has been amazing--I have such great respect for this place and its people."</p>
<p>Over the past six months, he's virtually lived at the hospital, sleeping over most nights while his wife holds down the fort at home and work. The oncology unit, he says, "treats not only the child, but the whole family. It's always been a priority in the system."</p>
<p>In fact, Laird has chosen to speak not only for his fellow front-line parents too busy and drained from living out of a suitcase, but also for the high-calibre caregivers and staff he's come to know well, some who have quietly told him they don't understand why the vaccine wasn't offered inhouse to people like him.</p>
<p>The way the government has rolled out the H1N1 vaccine, forgetting about the very unique needs of critically ill children and their families, has been an insult to those dedicated health care providers.</p>
<p>"I don't think anyone would consciously undermine the Children's Hospital and the families it treats," he says. "But at the very least, the hospital has been neglected, and through that, it does undermine their good work."</p>
<p>Laird doesn't want others to point the finger at professional hockey players. And he's not looking for sympathy. What he does hope is that this debacle gives us all pause when it comes to the state of our in-transition provincial health care system.</p>
<p>"If this is the level of management in the system, what does this hold in store for us?"</p>
<p>He's not stamping his feet, he's not outraged about this gross instance of negligence on the part of health officials.</p>
<p>Instead, Laird uses words like "bewildered" to describe his state of mind.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because, as he describes it, the H1N1 hysteria doesn't affect him too much; he and families like him "live in a pandemic state all of the time."</p>
<p>But that's all he can give me for now.</p>
<p>His cellphone is ringing; his son, the little boy who wouldn't benefit from the H1N1 shot because his immune system is already too comprised, needs him.</p>
<p>And he needs his dad to be healthy.</p>
<p>It's a matter of life and death.</p>

<p>Re: "Taxpayers first," Letter, Nov. 3.</p>
<p>Karla Swanzey's letter regarding how the homeless skipped the vaccination lineups didn't surprise me. We understand when people regard homeless men and women with fear or mistrust. It's easy to view people with apprehension when we don't understand them or they appear profoundly foreign to our way of life. I'd like to share the reasons for vaccination clinics at the Mustard Seed, along with the Calgary Drop-In and the Salvation Army Centre of Hope.</p>
<p>The people we serve live in close quarters, sleeping an arm's length apart, often suffering from compromised immune systems or other physical or mental health challenges. By Alberta Health Services' definition, they are at high risk of contracting H1N1. Once they leave the shelter for the day, to go to a job, or to training or support programs, they mingle with thousands of others. Inoculating them protects the community by discouraging the spread of disease. Although they did avoid one lineup for one day, the rest of the year they spend in several lineups a day. I invite Swanzey to come to the Mustard Seed. Meet these people, see how they're working to turn their lives around, and find out how you can be part of a constructive solution to this serious social issue. Bless you.</p>

<p>I hope those who are stressed and losing sleep over the Flames getting their H1N1 shots can put it in perspective. We all know that life is not fair. We should also know that our government and ourselves have blown the whole severity of the H1N1 virus out of proportion. My advice is to get lots of sleep, eat well, exercise, wash your hands and laugh a little.</p>

<p>My theory as to why the Flames received the H1N1 shots is that they are all pregnant and that's the reason why they're not winning hockey games.</p>

<p>Re: "Flames' flu shots raise furor," Nov. 4.</p>
<p>I am not sure why people think the Flames don't deserve to receive the H1N1 shots. They received their shots on Friday and the clinics weren't even announced closed until Saturday night. We honour them as our hometown heroes. Do we not want to ensure we have a healthy NHL team? Has anyone asked Ron Liepert or Ed Stelmach if they've received their H1N1 shots? Who thinks they would stand in line? How about our mayor and council?</p>
<p>The few shots given out to our Flames aren't going to make a difference to the massive shortage. If the Flames were given the opportunity for the shots, why would they turn it down? Let's focus on the real problem--the mismanagement of our health-care system and the incompetent people making the decisions.</p>

<p>There's certainly no dearth of things that people are talking about this week. There's the H1N1 Follies, featuring a health minister who thinks he can create his own version of history and no one will notice. Or the city's new West Village plan, seemingly sprung like Athena, full-grown from the mayor's forehead.</p>
<p>But I want to focus this week on the big picture. Really big. Tomorrow at 6 p.m. at Pages on Kensington, my Wednesday counterpart on this page, Barry Cooper, and I will be joined by Dr. Jennifer Brenner from the Alberta Children's Hospital to discuss the future of foreign aid. This panel is the first in a series called Ideas that Matter, sponsored by Mount Royal University, and admission is free. The conversation, though, will be invaluable.</p>
<p>The West has spent $2.3 trillion on foreign aid over the last five decades, and there has been very little impact in the poorest countries. Indeed, when my parents left Tanzania in 1971, the per capita GDP there was $444 and 21 out of 100 kids died before age five. In 2003, the needle had hardly moved. The per capita income was $583 and child mortality was 17 out of 100.</p>
<p>How then do we think about the plight of the world's poor?</p>
<p>We could do nothing. After all, these countries are poor, have always been poor, and likely will always be poor.</p>
<p>But this solution is unsatisfying. The ethicist Peter Singer, in a famous analogy, asks us to consider if we were walking one day and saw a child drowning. We could save the child, but doing so would cause us to ruin our brand-new clothing. Of course, we would all jump in, even at a minor cost to ourselves. Singer suggests that dealing with global poverty is exactly the same: the child is starving, not drowning, and she is across the world, not the street, but for a relatively small monetary sacrifice.</p>
<p>The problem is that not everyone agrees that this small monetary sacrifice-- in the form of foreign aid --actually does any good. Economists including William Easterly and Dambisa Moyo suggest that western aid has been at best ineffectual and, at worst, has actually harmed those who it purports to help.</p>
<p>Their suggestion: don't try to plan interventions, let the market work, and let NGOs continue to do small-scale interventions (like vaccinating against the Guinea worm in one small village in Ghana) that have impact.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have folks like Bono and the economist Jeffrey Sachs telling us that the only way to improve the state of the world is to double foreign aid to pay for critical investments in health education and infrastructure.</p>
<p>In seeking to unravel this, I turned to the smartest person I know: John McArthur, a Canadian who is close to Sachs and is CEO of Millennium Promise. He confirmed what I suspected: that there is little difference between the two schools of thought. Those who favour more foreign aid agree that mistakes have been made, and their current proposals are based upon finding those small interventions that work, and bringing them to scale.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this feels right. It's not that the poorest countries have been hurt by capitalism, it's that they've been bypassed by it. Critical investments in human capital will be followed by investments in financial capital, allowing these countries to join the global economy.</p>
<p>So, we as citizens should be lobbying our governments to increase foreign aid, and we should also be putting our own money behind it, by supporting NGOs (the Aga Khan Foundation is one of many examples) whose interventions have been shown to work.</p>
<p>Join us on Friday and let us know what you think.</p>

<p>Those folks who are outraged that members of the Calgary Flames got their H1N1 shots last Friday should chill out--to the temperature of the ice the Flames skate on. And shame on Alberta Health Services for scapegoating and firing a senior staffer who was involved in making the decision that vaccinations should be provided for the team and their families. There was nothing wrong with making the vaccinations available to the team.</p>
<p>One of the most enigmatic aspects of the H1N1 virus is the way it has been singling out younger people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, the demographic of the Flames players. The team is at greater risk of contracting the virus because they play in a venue where thousands of people gather, and where they are swarmed by dozens of fans, including children. They travel to other cities, are in close sweaty contact with the players of other teams, and when they are at home, they make dozens of public appearances, including visiting sick children in the hospital. Opportunities not only to contract the virus, but to spread it to hundreds of other people, are rife.</p>
<p>Apart from the public health aspect, it makes good business sense to ensure the team is healthy.</p>
<p>As for those who believe the Flames should have gone to stand in line with everyone else, it's worth remembering that these gentlemen cannot go out in public without being mobbed by fans, particularly adoring children. Vaccinating them separately was the most orderly, efficient way to do it--and the comparatively few doses of vaccine that were expended on the players and their families did not contribute to the shortage. The arguments of those who are irate about the Flames'flu shots rest on very thin ice indeed.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>More backup; Federal liberals responsible for shortage of flu vaccine</b>

</p>
<p>I n politics, as in the courtroom, it is wise to never ask a question unless you know the answer. A seasoned politician like Dr. Carolyn Bennett, the Liberal health critic, should know this. Bennett, a medical doctor, was the minister of state for public health in the Paul Martin government and a person who should know the history of flu vaccination contracts in Canada.</p>
<p>Thisweek, Bennettdemanded to know details of the exclusive contract between the federal government and GlaxoSmith-Kline, Canada's sole producer of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>"We should be able to see the contract," Bennett said. "There's lots of questions around it and we need to know what it says." No argument with that. But then, noting that the U.S. government ordered vaccine from five companies, she asked, "Why did the Conservative government . . . limit Canada to just one supplier?The role of pandemic planning is backup, backup, backup," she said.</p>
<p>Oops. The exclusive 10-year contract for vaccine supply in Canada was signed by Bennett's own party. Jean Chretien's Liberal government awarded it to Shire Bio-Chem of Quebec in 2001, after which Shire BioChem donated $56,000 to the Liberal party. Shire BioChem was bought out in 2004 by <span class="companylink">ID Biomedical Corp</span>. of Vancouver, which maintained vaccine production in Quebec. <span class="companylink">ID Biomedical</span> was in turn purchased the following year by British giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> and thus we have the single source supplier that exists today, courtesy of Bennett's own Liberals.</p>
<p>Despite the considerable albumen on her face, we thank Bennett for raising the issue. Backup, backup, backup is indeed crucial in emergency planning. Having Canada's H1N1 vaccine made exclusively by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>(GSK)at its Ste-Foy, Que., plant is putting too many eggs in one basket. GSK also produces most of Canada's seasonal flu vaccine and, under direction by the federal government, had to finish making it first before starting the H1N1 vaccine. As well, GSK's factory has only one production line.</p>
<p>When asked to make two versions of the vaccine, one with the adjuvant booster and one without, switching between the two caused a slowdown.</p>
<p>This is not to say that GSK is doing a bad job. But as Rob Van Exan of rival company Sanofi Pasteur recently told the House of Commons health committee, Canada should consider having a second pandemic vaccine supplier to maximize the security of its supply.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, also says that having another supplier might help "hedge our bets."</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Stephen Harper's health minister, Leona Aglukkaq, defended the single supply source set up by the Liberals, saying the system is working well.</p>
<p>For a government that believes in healthy competition, it is an odd stance.</p>

</p>
<p>After first urging everyone to get inoculated against H1N1 flu, politicians are now shunning vaccination as if the shots themselves carry the plague.</p>
<p>There's no official Tory caucus policy on MLAs getting vaccinated. Some might have had their shots before the shortages struck.</p>
<p>Now, nobody does. Vaccination outside the new restrictive system has become a crime against the taxpayer. Politicians are more afraid of the vaccine than the flu.</p>
<p>Public skepticism is certainly justified after the Calgary Flames got back-door shots and a health-care manager who supplied the vaccine was swiftly fired.</p>
<p>Officials say the response shows favouritism won't be tolerated, but they seem to be holding their breath at the same time. It's a big system that could be hiding horrors of which they are unaware.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert stoutly insists there is no privileged access. He also stomped on a rumour his own family had jumped the queue.</p>
<p>"This is just nonsense," he says. "I have not been vaccinated and nobody in my family has been vaccinated."</p>
<p>NDP Leader Brian Mason says he won't get the vaccine yet because "people already see politicians as the most expendable of characters."</p>
<p>Treasury Board president Lloyd Snelgrove came up with the line of the week when I asked if he's had a shot.</p>
<p>"No--our job is to stay in the legislature and be needled by pricks, not go out and be pricked by needles."</p>
<p>Privileged access to vaccine is the hot-button issue, but the deeper one is the mishandling of the whole pandemic plan--and who is responsible.</p>
<p>Two officials have now been stuck with the fallout: top health doctor Andre Corriveau, who says the decision to vaccinate widely at the beginning was his alone; and now the mid-level manager fired over the Flames mess.</p>
<p>Directly and indirectly, both work for the health minister, the ultimate boss of the entire system.</p>
<p>All the opposition parties are now calling for Liepert's resignation. But there's still no thought of replacing this prickly, impatient minister. Liepert has the premier's "full confidence," I hear.</p>
<p>Such cries for a minister's head are a dime a dozen, but on rare occasions they're justified.</p>
<p>In this case, public confidence has been so undermined that Liepert should step down.</p>
<p>In the U.K., ministers often resign to take the heat for underlings' errors. It's a point of honour and a way to show respect for the public; the parliamentary version of ritual hara-kiri.</p>
<p>Ministerial responsibility is a rusty tradition in Canada and dead in Alberta. There's little hope that Liepert will voluntarily exhume it.</p>
<p>But his troubles may deepen if auditor general Fred Dunn looks into the handling of the vaccine campaign.</p>
<p>Specifically, it would be interesting to know exactly how officials ended up abandoning their own official policy of vaccinating high-risk people first.</p>
<p>That led to the huge lineups, the collapse of the system when shortages hit, four days of zero vaccination for ordinary Albertans, and now the restricted new campaign.</p>
<p>Mix this in with the looming weekend vote on Stelmach's leadership, as well as a new Environics poll that shows the Tories at only 34 per cent, and it's easy to understand why the Tories are so tense.</p>
<p>In the background, there's muttering that some willing sacrifice should walk up the side of Alberta's political volcano and jump in. Liepert is the obvious candidate.</p>

<p>Parents might be stressed by the H1N1 pandemic, but <span class="companylink">Canwest Global Communications Corp</span>. and the Hospital for Sick Children have come together to provide some relief.</p>
<p>The partners announced Wednesday that Canwest's network of websites-- including canada.comand the sites for the chain's 10 major newspapers-- will now feature articles developed by staff from the Toronto hospital on how to keep children healthy during the flu season.</p>
<p>The news comes as researchers in California discovered that the H1N1 virus disproportionately targets the young, and hits them far more severely.</p>
<p>And with the Canadian government launching its largest vaccination drive last week to curb the spread of the virus, parents have been inundated with information that has raised many new questions.</p>
<p>The new website, viewable at www.canada.com/sickkids,is[http://www.canada.com/sickkids,is] part of the hospital's AboutKidsHealth project, which provides insight into health issues facing families and, in particular, children.</p>
<p>"The goal of AboutKidsHealth is to provide families with reliable, current information about all areas influencing child health and family quality of life in a format that is easy to understand," said Dr. Ross Hetherington, director of AboutKidsHealth. "Our new partnership will extend the reach of this important information to millions of readers through Canwest's distribution network."</p>

<p>The H1N1 flu virus has forced the Moncton Wildcats junior hockey team two cancel a pair of games later this week. The team announced Wednesday that two players have tested positive for the virus and that more than two dozen other players and team staff have shown symptoms of the virus. The Wildcats' games Thursday and Friday have been postponed, Gilles Courteau, commissioner of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, said Wednesday. No members of the Wildcats organization have been hospitalized due to the virus, Courteau said. "Nevertheless, the players and certain members of the team's staff will be quarantined for the next seven days," Courteau said in a news release.</p>

</p>
<p>In a fitting piece of symmetry, Geroy Simon, No. 81 for the Lions, is exactly 81 yards behind leading Fred Stamps of the Eskimos for the CFL pass-receiving title heading into the final game of the regular season Friday night.</p>
<p>But the biggest issue facing the league's two most productive receivers is not personal goals but their health, and which one can get over the flu with enough strength left to make a difference in the decider for third place in the West Division.</p>
<p>For the second straight day, Stamps was missing from practice Wednesday along with Edmonton teammates Tristan Jackson, Calvin McCarty, Andrew Nowacki and third-string quarterback Jared Zabransky.</p>
<p>Comparatively, the Lions would appear to have done a better job of hand-washing, since Simon, linebacker JoJuan Armour and defensive back Korey Banks are on the rebound and returned to practice yesterday. Only receiver Michael Bumpus, attending to his pregnant fiancee, was missing from the Surrey workout.</p>
<p>Still, a number of Lions are operating under duress with what they have termed seasonal flu, unrelated to the H1N1 virus which appears to be running rampant in the province of Alberta, putting everybody on edge to the point where the nervous Calgary Flames jumped the queue to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Centre Dean Valli, guard Sherko Haji-Rasouli and Simon were among the Leos who worked out Wednesday when they would have preferred to remain in bed.</p>
<p>"I have the flu, but I don't have H1N1, which everybody appears to think I do," Simon said. "Guys are pulling away from me. I would, too. Half our team is sick. I couldn't get up and function [Tuesday] so they told me to stay home. Coming in to practice today [Wednesday], I said to myself, 'I don't know how I'm going to get through this practice.' But once you get going, and the adrenaline kicks in, you forget about it. At least you try to."</p>
<p>While the Lions and Esks, both 8-9, both need a win Friday to be guaranteed a playoff spot, one Lion is already confirmed as a championship game participant. Practice roster player Andrew Harris, winner of the Wally Buono Award, will play for the Vancouver Island Raiders in the Canadian junior final Nov. 14 in Nanaimo. Harris, a running back, was named as the most outstanding junior player in Canada Wednesday.</p>
<p>END ZONE: University of Windsor centre Matt Morencie, selected by the Lions in this year's CFL draft, then released after training camp, has signed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.</p>

</p>
<p>A Lower Mainland doctor who vaccinated members of the Abbotsford Heat professional hockey team against H1N1 this week broke the rules by giving them shots ahead of higher risk individuals, B.C.'s medical health officer says.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall said Wednesday he will tell the doctor at Abbotsford's West Oaks Medical Centre that the vaccinations were inappropriate and "outside provincial guidelines for the vaccination program."</p>
<p>The program, which is facing a shortage of the H1N1 vaccine, is currently focused on people with underlying chronic health conditions, children aged six months to five years, pregnant women, first nations and some front-line health care workers.</p>
<p>"There has been no authority given by me to give sports teams access [to the vaccine]," Kendall said. "We don't plan to give priority access to professional sports teams or amateur teams either."</p>
<p>All but five of the 27 members of the Abbotsford Heat -- the Calgary Flames' farm team -- were vaccinated at the clinic early this week after they fell ill during a recent 11-day road trip and were deemed "high risk" by the team's physician.</p>
<p>The vaccinations came just days after members of the Calgary Flames and their families jumped the queue for shots against H1N1 in Alberta. Alberta's Health Services fired the senior staff member responsible for releasing the Flames' vaccine on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Kendall said it's worrying the athletes got their shots against H1N1 when there's a shortage of the vaccine.</p>
<p>"I'd love to say it was an Alberta vaccine and it was a rogue doctor [who administered it]," Kendall said, but added: "It was a recommendation by the team physician. I'm going to have a discussion with him saying it wasn't appropriate."</p>
<p>Kendall said it's up to physicians, who can collect a number of vaccine doses, to deliver the shots to people who meet the high-risk criteria.</p>
<p>He said he likely won't refer a doctor to the B.C. College of Physicians for discipline unless the individual persists in "flagrantly bending the rules or helping patients jump the queue."</p>
<p>If it's just one instance, he said, it's likely an error of judgment.</p>
<p>The Abbotsford Heat Hockey Club, owners and operators of the Abbotsford Heat of the American Hockey League, said Wednesday they appreciate the implications of a potential outbreak of the H1N1 flu and the protocols in place to manage access to the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Team president and chief executive officer Tom Mauthe said in a statement the decision was made to immunize the team members after the players became ill on the road.</p>
<p>He would not disclose who was immunized, and who was not, citing confidentiality. Heat officials say the members lined up for the shots along with the general public, while other personnel, outside the team, did not get immunized.</p>
<p>"At no time did anyone from the Abbotsford Heat receive preferential treatment, nor did they jump a queue," Mauthe said.</p>
<p>Heat spokesman Dave Sheldon, who travels with the team, but wasn't immunized, said the team "took the best advice of the doctor to get this taken care of," noting the athletes have the right to get treatment if they're at high risk. "People are forgetting these guys are not just athletes, they're people," he said.</p>

</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>590 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Pregnant women in Ottawa will have the choice of getting an unadjuvanted H1N1 flu shot starting today, after the city's public health officials received 5,500 doses of the vaccine.</p>
<p>The unadjuvanted shot is expected to be available at the city's five public vaccination clinics, if expectant mothers ask for it.</p>
<p>The unadjuvanted vaccine does not contain a chemical immune booster, which typically increases a vaccine's potency.</p>
<p>But because there is little hard scientific evidence about the safety and effectiveness of adjuvanted vaccines in pregnant women, the Public Health Agency of Canada is giving expectant mothers, who might otherwise choose not to be vaccinated, the option of getting an unadjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>The tradeoff is, the unadjuvanted vaccine could turn out to be less effective in pregnant women, who tend to have weaker immune systems.</p>
<p>By the end of the week, pregnant women who want the unadjuvanted vaccine may be able to avoid the public clinics altogether and go straight to a family doctor or obstetrician for the shot.</p>
<p>Sherry Nigro, manager of pandemic planning for Ottawa Public Health, said plans are being finalized with "alternate service providers to set up designated clinics for pregnant women."</p>
<p>In the meantime, with delays in manufacturing the adjuvanted vaccine and a dwindling supply nationwide, Ottawa's vaccination clinics could run out of the pandemic flu shot for other people by the end of the week, Nigro warned.</p>
<p>"We have not had confirmation of our next delivery of the adjuvanted vaccine," said Nigro.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one Ottawa resident has died from complications due to swine flu, bringing the total number of H1N1-related deaths in the city to six. Nigro said the person had an underlying health condition, but she did not provide any additional information about him or her.</p>
<p>With the opening Wednesday of six flu assessment centres across the city, Ottawa is effectively fighting the pandemic virus on two fronts -- preventing its spread in the community by vaccinating as many people as possible, and offering medical help to those who develop flu-like illnesses.</p>
<p>Ottawa is one of a handful of Ontario cities that has reported widespread flu activity. Kingston, Niagara and a couple of municipalities outside Toronto are also considered flu hotspots.</p>
<p>To reduce the chance of infections among current patients, all Ottawa-area hospitals have started limiting the number of visitors a patient can have.</p>
<p>The policy started last week at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario and quickly expanded to the Queensway Carleton Hospital.</p>
<p>The new policy means a patient at CHEO can have up to two parents or guardians visiting only -- no friends or other relatives. The other hospitals -- Queensway Carleton, The Ottawa Hospital and Montfort -- are restricting the number or visitors to one per patient, with no children under 12 allowed. Children will also not be permitted to visit the birthing centres at the Montfort or Queensway Carleton.</p>
<p>"We're reminding the public that if you are not well yourself, please do not come to visit somebody who is an in-patient at one of the hospitals," said Dr. Lindy Samson, head of infectious diseases and pandemic planning at CHEO.</p>
<p>In the past week, hospital emergency departments have seen between 10- and 25-per-cent more patients than they normally do at this time of year.</p>
<p>Up to one-third of patients with respiratory illnesses show flu symptoms, said Samson.</p>

<p>A bed shortage at The Ottawa Hospital, caused by the H1N1 outbreak, means many surgeries are being postponed.</p>
<p>Dr. Jeff Turnbull, the chief of staff, told the hospital's board on Wednesday afternoon that the Civic and General campuses were each at almost 105-per-cent capacity, with some patients stuck in hallways.</p>
<p>On one end of the log-jam, the emergency rooms are seeing about a 40-per-cent increase in visits, which translates into an increase in the number of patients who need to be admitted.</p>
<p>On the other end, it's harder than normal to free up beds by transferring out patients who should be in long term care facilities, because those facilities are closing their doors to new admissions as a result of the outbreak. Currently, there is a back-up of 137 patients who belong in long-term care, up from a more typical 100-120, Turnbull said after the meeting.</p>

<p>Day 1 went smoothly for Ottawa's six new flu assessment clinics, though some people are having trouble remembering which clinics are for sick people and which offer flu shots.</p>
<p>The new assessment clinics are open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays so that people suffering flu-like symptoms won't have to go to hospital emergency rooms or walk-in clinics if they lack doctors of their own.</p>
<p>Public health officials want to keep flu patients separate from the rest of the population, and want to ease the burden on emergency departments.</p>
<p>"It's going OK. There are not huge numbers. I think about 15 people have come in so far, wanting to be assessed with flu-like symptoms," said Jack McCarthy, executive director of the Somerset West Community Health Centre, at about 2 p.m.</p>
<p>"It's, I'd say, a steady trickle," he said. "Probably an equal number have come looking for the H1N1 vaccine, and we say we don't have that."</p>
<p>(The assessment clinics are for sick people only; the city-run vaccination clinics are at different locations.)</p>
<p>"Certainly we were activated to take pressure off the emergency departments at the hospitals. I think as people get to know we're here ... I'd anticipate numbers could rise. But it's hard to predict."</p>
<p>Normally his centre serves 13,000 patients, offering family doctors, nurse practitioners, and services such as scheduled exams for healthy babies.</p>
<p>It has cut these back, postponing people's physical exams and some of the work with seniors and babies, in order to run the flu assessment. That takes a staff of about 20, including people to handle the forms and reception.</p>
<p>"And if we're not busy, those staff will be doing other stuff."</p>
<p>Patients are assessed as having mild, medium or severe symptoms. Some are given Tamiflu (an anti-viral medication) and others are sent home with instructions on how to take care of themselves with rest and fluids.</p>
<p>One child who came to the Pinecrest-Queensway centre on Richmond Road was sent to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, though the child didn't need an ambulance, said executive director Wanda MacDonald. She didn't know the child's age or sex.</p>
<p>The centre had about 15 patients in the first two hours it was open, she said.</p>
<p>Asked whether her staff was able to cope with the numbers, she said: "Oh, totally.</p>
<p>"So far so good," she added. "And we certainly have the capacity."</p>
<p>Several clinics visited by the Citizen looked ready to cope with larger numbers with very few people in the waiting rooms.</p>
<p>All staff at the clinics were wearing masks, and many wore full-length disposable gowns.</p>
<p>An Ottawa Hospital spokeswoman says it's still too early to tell whether the assessment clinics have eased pressure on the hospital.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Flu Assessment Clinics</p>
<p>The six flu assessment clinics are at:</p>
<p>- Sandy Hill Community Centre, 221 Nelson St.</p>
<p>- Somerset West Community Health Centre, 55 Eccles St.</p>
<p>- Centretown Community Health Centre, 420 Cooper St.</p>

<p>Re: "No time to play politics - or jump queues" (Editorial, Nov. 4).</p>
<p>Thank you for your voice of reason. I am a nurse at the McGill University Health Centre. People die of seasonal flu every year, but because they are usually old and fragile, with underlying medical conditions, nobody seems to care much. Certainly, nobody starts lining up at 4 a.m. on a yearly basis for a flu shot!</p>
<p>But that's what H1N1 is, people - the flu. It's not anthrax. It's not smallpox. Yes, young otherwise healthy people have died of it, but young, healthy people die every day from motor-vehicle accidents.</p>
<p>For the most part, the flu will make you feel like excrement for a couple of weeks. You'll feel weak and miserable and drink a lot of soup and tea, and then recover and get on with your life.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the vaccine will fix it so you don't lose those weeks of your life feeling ill. I don't have the time for that. Do you? Take the vaccine, if only to keep you able to go on with the business of your already full life. But for heavens' sake, H1N1 is not a death sentence!</p>

<p>Last Saturday night, the thing I feared most walked up my front steps and looked me in the eye. "Trick or treat," said the little girl, holding out her bag in anticipation.</p>
<p>I looked at her and gasped. And then I laughed. Her big eyes stared at me with an expression that said she was used to this kind of reaction at the door.</p>
<p>"Who made your costume?" I asked. "My dad and I."</p>
<p>I dumped some candy in her bag. And then the little H1N1 virus smiled, turned, and headed down the sidewalk to her next Halloween stop.</p>
<p>A year ago, the costume -- a white, virus-shaped outfit with H1N1 written on top and a little face peeking out -- would have gotten puzzled looks at the door on Halloween night. This year, things are different.</p>
<p>H1N1, or the swine flu as we are now not supposed to call it, has changed the way many of us see the world. As pandemics go, it is quite mild. But its psychological effects are farther-reaching. It has pricked the bubble of complacency about our health and the health of our families that many of us have been living in.</p>
<p>The fear that those we love will become extremely sick or die from the flu is most certainly overblown -- the chances of getting killed while driving or jay-walking are probably higher. But, rational thinking aside, that fear has burrowed deeply and is hard to shake. Which made the virus the perfect costume for Halloween, 2009.</p>
<p>Among the usual ghouls and ghosts and vampires, the virus was the only costume that represented something that truly scares me. And I am far from alone. The little girl and her father tapped into this zeitgeist with the creepily clever Halloween costume.</p>
<p>Halloween came at the end of a week in which the quest for H1N1 flu vaccine consumed Ottawa, as it did much of the country. People -- some of them sick or pregnant or with young children, or all three -- lined up for hours to make sure they got vaccinated. Ottawa's health department was on Twitter updating an anxious public about how long the lineups were at various clinics, about who should get vaccinated, and who should wait their turn. Parents listened anxiously for any sign that their children might be developing symptoms of the dreaded flu. Others kept them home from school as a precaution.</p>
<p>How did we get here?</p>
<p>Flu awareness moved from a nagging voice in the background reminding us to wash our hands -- yet again! -- to a front-and-centre fear.</p>
<p>Everything changed after Vanetia Warner and Evan Frustaglio died. The 10-year-old Cornwall girl and the 13-year-old Toronto-area boy, both previously healthy and active, both became sick with the flu and then succumbed to it quickly.</p>
<p>Vanetia, a student at St. Anne's Catholic School in Cornwall, died on Oct. 24 at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. Her death was so sudden and unexpected that her grandparents went away overnight on Friday, only to be called to CHEO where their granddaughter was on life support.</p>
<p>Evan had been playing in a London hockey tournament when he became sick. At first he continued to play hockey, then his mother, a nurse, brought him home and took him to a clinic where a doctor pronounced his lungs clear and sent him home. The next day, he collapsed on the bathroom floor and was rushed to hospital where he died.</p>
<p>The parents and grandparents of Vanetia and Evan talked to reporters through a thick fog of shock. The shock rippled across the province.</p>
<p>The shock turned to a barely suppressed panic, despite the fact that most of us know better. We have all heard the statistics. Flu can be deadly. Every year thousands of people die as a result of the seasonal flu. And most of us shrug our shoulders.</p>
<p>But we also know that this flu is different. While seasonal flu usually targets the elderly and frail, the H1N1 virus is taking sharper aim at the young who have no immunity.</p>
<p>While those with underlying health problems and pregnant women are at particular risk, the virus has also killed healthy children and teens in a seeming random fashion.</p>
<p>One day Evan Frustaglio is scoring goals, the next he is stricken with the flu. One day Vanetia Warner is dancing to tween pop music, and the next day she is on life-support at CHEO.</p>
<p>We live in a world in which the protective power of antibiotics, vaccinations and other medicine are taken for granted. It makes us complacent. H1N1 has reminded us that germs can still be deadly. That is not a bad thing to be aware of, but it can be frightening.</p>
<p>And it makes an innocent face peeking out of a white, puffy virus costume a scary sight indeed.</p>

<p>I have been following the news about the H1N1 vaccination clinics and the reaction to them, which seems to be all negative. I went to the Oct. 29 clinic in Smiths Falls and, yes, the line was very long and it was not nice weather.</p>
<p>I found it to be a positive experience. The children were running around playing on the grass. The mothers were helping each other out with toys, books, snacks and Kleenex tissues. I was impressed at how these ladies co-operated with each other.</p>
<p>Once inside high school, I found the process fast, efficient and courteous. The public health staff were very professional even though it had been a long day. I was close to the end of it. All things considered, I think the clinic was handled well.</p>

<p>My family received their H1N1 shot in Casselman as part of the Eastern Ontario Health Unit's program. It was easy and well planned. I had my four-year-old child and 10-month-old baby so it could have been a disaster.</p>
<p>The organizers were clear about who was eligible and who was not before we entered the clinic. Our children played together outside on the grass and the parents chatted, catching up, which normally we are too busy to take time to do.</p>
<p>Upon entry, we were each given a number. When our number was called, we went up to the registration desk. My driver's licence and their health cards were swiped to input my address. There were no confusing forms to fill out, just a few questions and we were done. The shot took a few minutes and we were on our way, two hours in total.</p>
<p>I want to send a huge thank you to the organizers and the workers at Casselman clinic they made this stressful situation an easy and enjoyable success. Maybe the big city should talk to the well organized country and find out the efficient way to deal with a mass number of people.</p>

<p>Re: On the front lines, Nov 3.</p>
<p>My family attended the H1N1 clinic at 100 Constellation on Friday night to get vaccinations for our two young boys, considered in the "high priority" group for children under five years old.</p>
<p>My husband waited in the rain for one hour to obtain wristbands. He was told we should come back for 7:45 p.m. We showed up at 7:15 p.m., optimistic that the nurses may even be ahead of schedule. Although we were disappointed to find there were still 400 people to be vaccinated ahead of us, we came prepared to wait, and read books and took plenty of walks.</p>
<p>The boys were finally vaccinated at 10:30 p.m. about three hours after our designated time. Were we frustrated? Yes. Was it a challenge to deal with two young boys who were well past their bedtime? Of course.</p>
<p>These unpleasantries were washed away by the smiling faces and truly happy demeanour of all the staff. They continually thanked us for our patience, and took the time to explain the process in detail. The nurse was fantastic with our boys and genuinely wanted to make the experience as comfortable as possible. One staff member even gave out candy to the kids while we waited. All this was incredibly surprising (and very much appreciated), given the clinic was open an hour and a half past the scheduled closing time, and some staff members were working since 6:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Although it was frustrating for us to take so much time out of our day (and especially at bedtime), it's downright exhausting for the clinic staff, yet they didn't complain. Hats off to Ottawa's health professionals!</p>

<p>A two-month-old baby who died Wednesday likely had the H1N1 flu, according to health officials in this southwestern Ontario city.</p>
<p>The baby, along with an elderly couple in their 70s, died from flu-like symptoms, the Middlesex-London Health Unit said in a statement released early Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>"Although the exact virus subtype is not yet known, all three cases are likely to be the novel H1N1 strain, as it is the only influenza A strain currently circulating in the community," according to the news release.</p>
<p>The elderly man and woman both had multiple underlying medical conditions. It's unclear if the infant also did. All three were ill with influenza A and further testing will be completed to determine if they also were sick with H1N1.</p>
<p>Their identities have not been released but all three lived in the London area.</p>
<p>So far, the province has had 37 confirmed swine flu-related deaths since April.</p>

<div>824 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>

<p>Until this week, Daniel Alfredsson had pretty much decided against getting an H1N1 flu vaccination. Now the Ottawa Senators captain is not so sure.</p>
<p>Unlike players from the Calgary Flames, who jumped to the head of the line, the Senators will continue to wait their turn for the vaccine.</p>
<p>And even when the vaccine is made available to the broader public, the team will not mandate that each player get a shot. That's a personal decision, head coach Cory Clouston said Wednesday.</p>
<p>But some players, like Alfredsson, are feeling a little pressure to roll up their sleeves.</p>
<p>The Senators captain's inclination is not to get vaccinated, and for now he says he isn't close to changing his mind.</p>
<p>But a letter he just received from the Swedish Olympic Committee could sway him.</p>
<p>"They said they would like everyone to have the vaccine before the Olympics," Alfredsson said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The committee doesn't demand that the athletes get vaccinated, he said, but "they pretty well strongly recommend it."</p>
<p>That creates a tricky situation for the 36-year-old Senators star.</p>
<p>He was on Sweden's gold-medal winning hockey team in 2006 and could even be captain of this year's team, given the retirement of Mats Sundin and the uncertain status of Peter Forsberg.</p>
<p>Alfredsson at least has a little time to think about it, since it appears as if it will be some time before the vaccine is made available to the general public.</p>
<p>But it doesn't appear as if he's going to change his mind.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure when it's going to be made available to people outside the risk group, but as of now, no," he said.</p>
<p>He accepts that hockey players can be considered a high-risk group, because of their extensive travel and public-appearance schedules, but figures that can be overcome through common sense.</p>
<p>"We're in a position where we meet a lot of people and we travel a lot," he said.</p>
<p>"I guess that would put us in a risk group more than a normal person. But it's really out of your control.</p>
<p>"All you can do is make sure you're smart about hygiene, make sure you don't shake too many hands."</p>
<p>Among other players, Jason Spezza also said that he will do a little more research before he makes a decision about the vaccine.</p>
<p>"Do my due diligence," he said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he's made a conscious effort to wash his hands more often, both at the rink and at home.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Calgary, the fallout from the players' queue-jumping was swift.</p>
<p>Alberta's provincial health authority on Wednesday fired the most senior staff member involved in releasing H1N1 vaccine to the Flames players and their family members.</p>
<p>"Like most Albertans, I am deeply offended that this circumstance has occurred," said a statement signed by Ken Hughes, board chairman of Alberta Health Services, and Stephen Duckett, CEO and president.</p>
<p>"AHS board and management have a fundamental commitment to serve all Albertans according to their needs, in medical priority," their statement said.</p>
<p>"This circumstance was a clear departure from that principle. We set the expectation that this should not have happened and should not happen again."</p>
<p>The name of the departing staff member was not released.</p>
<p>As for Calgary's circumvention, Clouston said he didn't know enough about the situation to comment. That was echoed by several players.</p>
<p>In Toronto, some Maple Leafs and Raptors players have received H1N1 doses, according to the Star, however, both teams deny moving to the front of the line.</p>
<p>There was other hockey-related flu news on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Moncton Wildcats announced the H1N1 virus has forced the cancellation of two Quebec major Junior Hockey League games later this week.</p>
<p>The Wildcats said players have tested positive for the virus and that more than two dozen other players and team staff have shown symptoms.</p>
<p>The Wildcats' games tonight and Friday have been postponed, said Gilles Courteau, commissioner of the Quebec league.</p>
<p>No members of the Wildcats organization have been hospitalized due to the virus, Courteau said.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, the players and certain members of the team's staff will be quarantined for the next seven days," Courteau said in a news release. "As such, the Moncton Wildcats' games this week are cancelled. We will keep monitoring the situation closely and, in the near future, we will look at different scenarios to reschedule the games.</p>
<p>"In closing, the Wildcats organization was very proactive and their management team deserves a lot of credit."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Cities stuck with bill for Tory 'propaganda'; Opposition blasts Conservatives for requiring extra billboards promoting economic program</b>
</div><div>Les Whittington    </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>335 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A06</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star    </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The federal government is being accused of wasting millions of taxpayers' dollars by forcing cash-strapped Ontario and municipalities to help pay for billboards advertising the Conservatives' economic program at thousands of infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>The Liberals and NDP slammed the Conservatives for requiring provincial and city governments receiving infrastructure cash to buy an additional sign at each building project specifying that the federal government paid part of the bill under its Economic Action Plan.</p>
<p>The billboards, which cost up to $4,250 apiece, are part of an extensive campaign by the federal government to promote its Jan. 27 budget, which was entitled the "Economic Action Plan."</p>
<p>Liberal MP Ralph Goodale (Wascana) said governments have traditionally needed only one billboard to share credit for jointly funding a project of this kind.</p>
<p>In the Commons, Goodale expressed outrage that the federal government is forcing provinces and cities to devote what he estimates at $45 million to promote the Conservative economic plan at a time when many Canadians are unable to H1N1 flu shots.</p>
<p>"While millions of Canadians cannot get vaccinated, the Conservatives are not only wasting up to $45 million on useless signs, but they actually want two signs, not just one, on every project," Goodale said. "They are sticking municipalities with a big part of the cost. Local tax dollars are being forced to finance Conservative propaganda."</p>
<p>NDP finance critic Thomas Mulcair said: "It is grotesque to find out that the Conservatives have been asking hard-strapped municipalities and provinces to contribute to their partisan publicity campaign."</p>
<p>"These signs have cost tens of millions of dollars and the Conservatives have the nerve to send that bill off to the municipalities and the provinces," Mulcair (Outremont) told reporters.</p>
<p>Transport Minister John Baird brushed aside the criticism, saying the federal government needs to let Canadians know how their money is being spent.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Jumping the swine line; News that the Calgary Flames, among others, had instant access to scarce vaccine should come as no surprise to a shocked public</b>
</div><div>Dave Perkins    </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>674 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>S02</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star    </div>
</p>
<p>Listen, all those professional sports teams that figure they can jump the public queue and obtain the H1N1 flu shots?</p>
<p>No problem - just as long as they don't stop for an MRI along the way.</p>
<p>This H1N1 scare is making public vaccine disbursement look like the lottery held for the Titanic lifeboats that cold April night in 1912.</p>
<p>So there's no surprise that the fromage is running deep in Alberta after news emerged that the Calgary Flames, en masse, had right-now access to the scarce vaccine. Their families and staff, too.</p>
<p>Thousands of Albertans, like Ontarians, stood in lines for hours before being turned away. Just imagine how the news was received that the Flames were whisked to a special private location, with their loved ones, and given the shots.</p>
<p>Probably how Ontarians will react, knowing some of the beloved Maple Leafs got theirs, too.</p>
<p>Pro athletes jumping health queues? Geez, imagine that. It has never happened before - other than, you know, an athlete getting an MRI every time he snaps his fingers or a ligament or two; those same MRIs that you, me and the milkman wait weeks or months to obtain. Other that that, I mean.</p>
<p>The Raptors admit "some" players and staff have been given the shot. They issued a statement saying they "have followed the protocols and recommendations established by Public Health officials regarding both the seasonal and H1N1 flu vaccinations" and that "only certain players and staff have received the H1N1 vaccine."</p>
<p>"We have not done a full-team immunization," GM Bryan Colangelo said. "We have offered seasonal-flu (shots) to everybody, but I don't think everybody has taken it. But everything we've acquired has been through the normal protocol."</p>
<p>The Maple Leafs, who had a suspected case with the Marlies in Tyler Bozak, initially refused comment, which suggested they had something to hide. Sure enough, they later confessed some players got their shots, but that "no preferential treatment was requested nor (sic) received." (Others might have a different opinion, once details emerge.)</p>
<p>You could almost make a case that pro athletes could indeed be considered in a higher-risk group for this nasty flu. Not up there with cancer patients and pregnant women, but higher up the pecking order than most of us. They are in close proximity, have plenty of physical contact with one another, lots of travel - the worst thing you can do if trying to stay healthy, in this opinion - and share facilities such as showers, linen, etc. Plus, unlike most of us, every time they go to work, they have 20,000 strangers breathing on them.</p>
<p>So there is an argument they may well be at a higher risk than many of us, even before considering economics. For instance, the Moncton Wildcats have two positive tests for H1N1, plus another 15 players and staff showing symptoms. The Quebec Major Junior Hockey League has postponed two games already, with a chance for more. Take that up a couple of sizes and imagine an NHL or NBA team suddenly postponing games and being quarantined. Imagine the ruckus when the time came to even everybody up.</p>
<p>The Flames, to get back to them, clearly jumped the line, got caught and had the nerve to say, "Our players did not seek to either avoid lineups or get special attention."</p>
<p>Well, no, the players themselves didn't. But the team certainly did and got nailed for it.</p>
<p>Now the Alberta government is investigating and the first civil service head has rolled.</p>
<p>But here's all anyone needs to know: There are rules and laws for the rich and famous and rules and laws for everyone else.</p>
<p>If that surprises anyone, they need a different kind of shot: the kind that arrives right between the eyes.</p>

</div><div>James Travers    </div>

</p>
<p>Ottawa -- Not much is more certain to blow a government off course than events. First observed by former British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, that old axiom is Stephen Harper's new reality.</p>
<p>Days ago, Conservatives had a breeze at their back. Now they're twisting in winds they can't control.</p>
<p>First, there were those big, blue, bogus stimulus cheques and then came the swine flu with its viral mix of fear, confusion and queue-jumping. Now, watchdogs are barking at a too-sunny economic forecast and who-cares crisis readiness.</p>
<p>Each alone would be a problem for any government. Together they threaten the trend Conservatives count on to transform their minority into a future majority.</p>
<p>Given the violence of political pendulum swings, Harper could still grasp his Holy Grail. Liberals remain in disarray, and 2010, beginning with the Olympics and continuing through a long list of events that flatter prime ministers, is particularly promising.</p>
<p>But it's also true that the cornerstone of Conservative success is suddenly stressed and in danger of cracking. Canadians who decided that the ruling party is competent to manage the nation's affairs now have worrying personal reasons to reconsider that assumption.</p>
<p>Their conclusion always made too light of the weight of evidence. Inadequate as the government's immunization plan is now proving, its financial stewardship has long been inept. Along with missing an imminent recession and hiding inevitable deficits, the faux-economist Harper gnawed through an inherited $13 billion surplus with politically charged tax cuts and runaway spending.</p>
<p>Canadians already concerned about family health will soon be paying the price for those financial mistakes. Kevin Page, the federal budget officer Conservatives put in place and are now trying to silence, is contradicting the Conservative claim that the return of good times will rescue the country from long-term structural deficits. If Page is prescient - and his gold standard work to date only inspires confidence - Harper will have to break his word not to raise taxes or cut services to balance Ottawa's books.</p>
<p>Page isn't alone in finding fault. A single thread weaves through Auditor General Sheila Fraser's Tuesday reports on the government's performance. From preparing for emergencies to guarding against abuse of foreign workers to delivering foreign aid, Conservatives boast a better game than they play.</p>
<p>That criticism is hardly unique: Fraser became a national icon, as well as a local voice of sanity, by showing no fear or favour in her eviscerations. But her latest deconstructions are a direct challenge to the carefully crafted illusion that Conservatives are delivering the better government they promised.</p>
<p>Strip that illusion away and what's mostly left is a highly secretive, hyper-partisan administration benefiting by favourable comparison to a fractured opposition that has yet to convince voters it could do any better. A similar dynamic helped Liberals form four successive governments, a string broken only when citizens, taxpayers and voters lost trust in the party's ethics and competence.</p>
<p>Conservatives haven't reached that tipping point. Their ability to fashion broad support from narrow interests is unmatched, as is the positive perception of the Prime Minister's leadership.</p>
<p>But events that blow governments off course also expose frailties. Winds that once filled Harper's sails are now in his face, slowing momentum and whipping doubt into dust devils.</p>
<p>James Travers' column appears Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Grade 9s weigh in on front-page news; Story on blind professor tops list as students play editor at annual Take Our Kids to Work</b>
</div><div>Katie Daubs    </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>625 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A03</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star    </div>
</p>
<p>Although a bald bear would likely win a duel with a balding prince, that same prince will usually win the battle for the Star's front page.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, 52 Grade 9 students learned this timeless lesson as part of the Toronto Star's Take Our Kids to Work day. After a morning of touring the downtown office and the paper's printing presses in Vaughan, students at both locations were given the day's stories and photos, and asked to craft the front page.</p>
<p>Charlie Kopun, the assistant managing editor of design, said it was all about finding the right mix - not too light, institutional or depressing. Funny and weird things, in moderation, have appeal.</p>
<p>"We have the royals visiting Canada. It's really big news, like actual headline news," said Allison Chang-Ouellette from Woodlands School in Mississauga.</p>
<p>Some students thought a bald bear at a German zoo would be better for a snappy stand-alone photo.</p>
<p>"We could say something about Fuzzy Wuzzy," said Lauren Tress from Thornhill Secondary School.</p>
<p>"It's not interesting," said James Dean, from Clarkson Secondary School. "Like all of Toronto needs to know about some bald bear." The discussion echoed the newsroom upstairs - people arguing about the merits of a story, agonizing over headlines, and checking their cellphones when they thought nobody was watching.</p>
<p>One student vetoed a train derailment in India because nobody died. A Michael Jackson story was deemed "old news."</p>
<p>The students decided on a Star exclusive for the main story on the front page, but after they left, their plans were scrapped when editors in the real newsroom decided to hold the story for a day when more space was available.</p>
<p>In its place went a story about a blind professor at the University of Toronto, in danger of losing his job. (The story, popular with the students, had been a teaser at the bottom of the page.)</p>
<p>The visit of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles went on the right-hand side, and a story about a tropical storm in the Philippines went below the fold.</p>
<p>In a bit of fun, a small blurb about Take Our Kids to Work day made the bottom right corner. Smaller throws to the Jaycee Lee Dugard kidnap inquiry (a very interesting story to the students in Vaughan), a Raptors game and an H1N1 update (which "everyone is sick of hearing about but wants to hear about," said Kalina Kopun) squeaked in at the top and bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Poor Dolores, the bear with little to no hair, didn't make the front page.</p>

<p>Frown and be proud: A bad mood is good for you.</p>
<p>That's the finding of Joseph Forgas, an Australian scientist who just published a research paper titled, "Think Negative!"</p>
<p>You know those smiling people who live on the sunny side, drink from half-full glasses and look forward to tomorrow?</p>
<p>They have brain damage. Or at least, processing damage.</p>
<p>Positive thinking makes them gullible. It impairs their memory.</p>
<p>By contrast, as Forgas writes, negative moods induce "careful thinking" and "greater attention to the external world."</p>
<p>So I shall now conduct an experiment.</p>
<p>First, I will pick a topic and jot down a positive thought. Then I will harm myself, thereby triggering negative feelings.</p>
<p>Will my thinking improve? Let's find out.</p>
<p>Topic: The H1N1 vaccination process</p>
<p>Positive: The government is trying its best in a complicated situation.</p>
<p>Action: I remove a shoe and deliberately stub my toe.</p>
<p>Negative: Bloody hell! That hurt. Gosh, I love living in a country that boasts the tax rates of Scandinavia and the health preparedness of Eastern Africa. Delays? Shortages? Lineups? I guess swine flu came out of nowhere. I suppose it was not stoking global pandemic fears for months. If there's an outbreak of Ebola in Canada, our eyeballs will be bleeding before the government commissions a study. Maybe I'll go out tonight and buy some crack and an assault weapon. Unlike vaccines, I can probably get those things in Toronto.</p>
<p>Topic: The Royal visit</p>
<p>Positive: The monarchy is an enduring part of our heritage.</p>
<p>Action: I swing a cricket bat at my torso.</p>
<p>Negative: Gasp. Now I'm winded. You know, winded like the TV anchors that will not stop babbling about the Prince and Duchess! Look! Charles and Camilla are sitting in a church! Now they are strolling around a historic site! Now their plane is idling on the tarmac! Are we really supposed to care about this anachronistic spectacle? The worst part? I can't sleep through this right royal yawn because the retooled CBC News Network is so jittery and frenetic, it's giving me seizures.</p>
<p>Topic: The automotive industry</p>
<p>Positive: It deserves our help.</p>
<p>Action: I give myself paper cuts with my financing agreement.</p>
<p>Negative: Now I can't type. Guess I'll read some recent press releases. Let's see: "<span class="companylink">BMW Canada</span> sets October sales record," "<span class="companylink">Audi Canada</span> achieves best year ever," "<span class="companylink">Subaru Canada</span>: Another month of record sales," "Best-ever October for Toyota and Lexus sales." Dear Car Execs: Could you please stop waxing apocalyptic and crying poor? Could you please refrain from stomping on loyal workers and acting in haste? The economy is rebounding and, soon enough, you can resume sipping Cristal from gold-plated chalices as the rest of us wonder what this "Check Engine" light on the dash could possibly mean.</p>
<p>Topic: Christmas</p>
<p>Positive: It's the best time of year.</p>
<p>Action: I ease my head into my tree-stand and tighten the screws.</p>
<p>Negative: Someone get this off my skull! Okay, Christmas really is the best time of year. But why does it have to begin so early? I was strolling Sears before Thanksgiving when I heard an announcement about the new North Pole display. I've been getting emails about "holiday" events and sales since Labour Day. Enough already. This best time of year has turned into an exhausting, four-month orgy of crass commercialization. (But, Santa, if you're reading, this year I'd like the H1N1 vaccine. Also, a new car, so I can avoid the TTC fare hike and get out of town before the next royal visit.)</p>
<p>That concludes my experiment. Draw your own conclusions.</p>

</p>
<p>The potentially deadly H1N1 virus cut a little close to home for the Toronto Marlies and Toronto Maple Leafs this week, which may be a contributing reason why the hockey players have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Marlies rookie centre Tyler Bozak missed two games while quarantined from his teammates after coming down with a flu, suspected to be H1N1.</p>
<p>His roommate, Viktor Stalberg, was told to go to a hotel while Bozak recuperated. When Bozak initially contracted the flu, Stalberg was still with the Leafs.</p>
<p>"From the severity of the flu, our doctors thought it was H1N1," Bozak said after practice Wednesday. "I never got tested. I just stayed at home. I didn't want to get guys sick. I didn't want to be around the guys."</p>
<p>Marlies coach Dallas Eakins said the team wanted to take all precautions necessary to keep the flu - H1N1 or any bug - out of the dressing room.</p>
<p>"We got him out of here right away," Eakins said. "You do that with any flu. You get him out of the room right away, send him home.</p>
<p>"(The flu) just goes right through a team. Their hands touch towels and coffee machines, sticks, water bottles, they cough, they sneeze, it doesn't matter."</p>
<p>None of the Leafs would comment after practice Wednesday on whether they had received the flu shot, citing medical privacy. The team later posted a statement saying the athletes had been tested but denied any protocols had been breached.</p>
<p>"We are operating with a heightened awareness of influenza and taking appropriate precautions," read the statement. "While all professional athletes are considered high risk to exposure and transmission of the flu due to excessive contact with other players, heavy travel requirements and public exposure, only certain players and staff have received the H1N1 vaccine."</p>
<p>Bozak may have contracted the flu on the Marlies' recent trip to play the Heat in Abbotsford, B.C., where the virus hit particularly hard. The Heat is the top farm team of the Calgary Flames, who are under intense scrutiny after their players were able to jump the queue to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>As a result, a health employee was fired Wednesday and the chairman of Alberta Health Services said "an investigation may result in further disciplinary action."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Glitches fail to faze WestJet; Says new reservation system will secure deals with foreign carriers; records drop in profit</b>
</div><div>BRENT JANG </div>
<div>520 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>B8</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>TRANSPORTATION REPORTER</p>
<p>A new computer reservations system is giving major headaches to <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>., but the carrier vows to work out the bugs, saying the technology opens the door to partnerships with foreign carriers.</p>
<p>Since WestJet introduced the SabreSonic system on Oct. 17, its website has crashed twice, leading to complaints from consumers frustrated by long waits to get through to the carrier's call centre, either to book flights or make changes and cancellations. There have also been 40-minute delays at airports because of various computer-related glitches, including problems originating from the <span class="companylink">Sabre Travel Network</span>.</p>
<p>WestJet chief executive officer Sean Durfy sent an e-mail to customers on Oct. 23, apologizing for the “slowdowns” in service – a contrite message also posted on the airline's website and still displayed this week as the first screen that consumers see.</p>
<p>In an interview yesterday, Mr. Durfy said the short-term pain will pass, and the Calgary-based carrier is looking forward to the benefits of having new technology that interacts with the computers of foreign airlines.</p>
<p>“When the system stabilizes, it will give us a bunch more flexibility,” he said.</p>
<p>An alliance with Dallas-based <span class="companylink">Southwest Airlines Co</span>., originally slated to take effect this fall, is back on the agenda, perhaps kicking in by late 2010 or early 2011. WestJet and Southwest say they will sell more tickets on each other's planes, as well as co-operate on connecting flights, baggage handling and electronic ticketing.</p>
<p>WestJet has also inked partnership deals with <span class="companylink">Air France</span> and KLM to help increase the number of connecting passengers, with inbound travellers already able to shift onto WestJet's domestic network. While Mr. Durfy declined to name new partners on the horizon, analysts say <span class="companylink">British Airways PLC</span> and <span class="companylink">Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd</span>. are next in line.</p>
<p>Mr. Durfy said WestJet will forge ahead this winter with flights to Mexico and the Caribbean, playing down concerns about the H1N1 influenza outbreak crimping travel demand.</p>
<p>He made the comments after the carrier announced that its third-quarter profit declined 46 per cent to $31.4-million while revenue fell 16 per cent to $600-million as consumers scaled back flying during the economic downturn.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">National Bank Financial Inc</span>. analyst David Newman said WestJet's October load factor – the proportion of seats filled by paying customers – rose to 77.3 per cent from 75.8 per cent, but seat sales eroded revenue.</p>
<p>Versant Partners Inc. analyst Cameron Doerksen said WestJet posted a respectable third-quarter operating margin of 12.8 per cent, surpassing his estimate of 11 per cent. Operating margin is earnings before interest and taxes, divided by revenue.</p>
<p>Mr. Doerksen said the new reservations system clears the way for WestJet to introduce its own frequent flier program.</p>

</p>
<p>Flip-flopping flu plans have left some Winnipeggers confused over whether they can get the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Flu clinics reopened Wednesday after a day-long hiatus when clinics were shut due to a shortage of vaccine doses.</p>
<p>Health officials reopened the clinics after they realized they had enough doses to continue vaccinating people at risk of falling severely ill from H1N1.</p>
<p>But when the clinics opened their doors Wednesday morning, they weren't hit by the usual mad rush of people. Lineups were short and no one had camped for hours before the clinics opened to try to be at the head of the line.</p>
<p>The poor turnout prompted health officials to revise their priority list for the third time in a week -- a move that critics suspect will leave Winnipeggers flummoxed about whether or not they're eligible.</p>
<p>"It's a very mixed message," said Alan Katz, a researcher for the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy. "I don't think the public understands it. I think they haven't done a great job of explaining themselves."</p>
<p>The city's initial vaccination plans were hampered last week when the federal government warned Manitoba Health it would not receive nearly as many vaccine doses as provincial planners had counted on. The fallout forced Winnipeg health officials to revise their initial priority list and ration their dwindling vaccine stock by turning away patients not considered at highest risk.</p>
<p>Since then, who's in and who's out has changed as vaccine doses become available.</p>
<p>"It probably has been a little bit confusing for everybody," said Winnipeg Regional Health Authority medical officer Dr. Sande Harlos.</p>
<p>"We started out with a priority list, we had to narrow that priority list, and now we've gone back to the original priority list."</p>
<p>That list includes: people under 65 with a chronic medical condition or other risk factor including obesity and alcoholism, anyone with a weakened immune system or those who live with and care for them, disadvantaged individuals, people who live in remote or isolated areas, single parents, pregnant women and people who live with or care for infants under six months.</p>
<p>Health Minister Theresa Oswald said health officials restricted vaccinations earlier in the week to those most at risk because of dwindling supply, but then quickly loosened those restrictions Wednesday when officials noticed lineups were not as long as last week.</p>
<p>She said pandemic plans are drafted to be flexible.</p>
<p>"What I have said to my department is to step back and remember the goal," Oswald said. "The goal is to vaccinate as quickly as possible the most people in the priority group that we can based on the supply of vaccine that we have."</p>
<p>"No question that having a changing kind of protocol is not great for the public," the minister said.</p>
<p>"But if we were, for the sake of not confusing people, to keep that priority list narrow, and therefore not having as many people flowing through, we would be missing the goal."</p>
<p>Progressive Conservative Leader Hugh McFadyen said the confusion caused by changing rules shows the province is making up its pandemic plan on the fly.</p>
<p>"It suggests the situation is completely chaotic," he said.</p>
<p>He said Premier Greg Selinger should step in and take a more active role in the flu fight to restore public confidence.</p>
<p>"I think people would give him credit if he showed that kind of leadership," McFadyen said.</p>

<p>THE Salvation Army now has a 23-bed wing available for homeless people with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"If you or I feel sick, we go home and get into bed," said Karen Hoeft, assistant executive director and community relations at the Salvation Army's Booth Centre downtown. "If a person is living on a mat, or in a dorm that they must vacate during the day, that leaves them outside and if they have flu-like symptoms, being on the street can cause complications."</p>
<p>The wing, which is in the Booth Centre at 180 Henry Ave., became available this month after the move of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's Crisis Stabilization Unit to its new location on Portage Avenue.</p>
<p>The new wing is not intended for people who show complications that indicate H1N1. They will still be sent to hospitals. Whether a person is ill enough to get a bed or whether they need to be sent to acute care will be discretionary.</p>
<p>The shelter has teamed up with the government and other organizations to run the wing efficiently. When someone comes into the facility, a basic questionnaire from the WRHA has been drafted that asks a person, "how are you feeling?"</p>
<p>During flu season, the shelters always see an influx of people, said Hoeft, but she expects there will be a higher demand for these beds than there would normally be.</p>
<p>Hoeft said the decision to use the space as an influenza recovery area was made jointly with the government.</p>
<p>"We have been very engaged with the government in discussing long-term holistic strategies," said Hoeft.</p>
<p>"This was a priority."</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- The H1N1 flu vaccine was made available to players on the Toronto Maple Leafs this week after all players and staff on the Toronto Marlies, the Leafs' farm team in the American Hockey League, received the vaccine recently because two Marlies players were thought to have contracted the virus, according to sources familiar with the situation.</p>
<p>Leafs officials said some players and staff took the shots, which were made available by the team medical staff in the dressing room after the Leafs played the Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday night at the Air Canada Centre. It is not known how many players had the shot because those questioned yesterday refused to comment.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Toronto Raptors of the NBA – like the Leafs, owned by Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment – said some of their players and staff had also been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Leafs president and general manager Brian Burke refused to comment aside from an official statement released by the team. The Leafs and Raptors spokesmen insisted the teams did not receive the vaccination outside the usual channels and did not jump any lines at medical clinics. They also said the close contact between teammates and opponents plus the heavy travel schedule make infection a high risk for sports teams.</p>
<p>“Any vaccine supplies received were obtained through normal distribution and no preferential treatment was requested nor received,” Leafs director of media relations Pat Park said in a statement.</p>
<p>Neither Dr. Noah Forman, the Leafs' medical director, nor Dr. Bruce Topp, the Marlies' doctor, could be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine is in short supply throughout Canada. It is supposed to be available only to members of high-risk groups such as children between the age of six months and five years, pregnant women, elderly people and health-care workers.</p>
<p>One source said executives and the medical staff of both the Leafs and the Marlies did not act until two players – Marlies forwards Tyler Bozak and Andre Deveaux – were suspected to have H1N1 flu, and a third, Richard Greenop, came down with the regular variety of flu.</p>
<p>The vaccine was made available to the Leafs because forward Jiri Tlusty was promoted to the team from the Marlies last week, while Bozak was ill. Tlusty was returned to the Marlies Monday but there was concern he could have carried H1N1 from the Marlies to the Leafs.</p>
<p>Interviews with several sources showed that there were no plans by the Leafs' medical staff to vaccinate the players until the problem with the Marlies came up.</p>
<p>Bozak came down with flu early last week. A source said Dr. Topp suspected it was the H1N1 virus but told team officials the only way to be sure was to get the player tested. The only way to do that was to send the player to a hospital and the doctor said there was no sense tying up a valuable hospital bed as long as Bozak was not seriously ill. Bozak was then isolated from his teammates by confining him to his home.</p>
<p>A few days later, Deveaux got sick. Again, H1N1 was suspected, but the doctors did not feel it was serious enough to tie up a hospital bed, a source said. But at this point, the doctors felt it was best to vaccinate the entire Marlies team and staff. Bozak returned to the team yesterday.</p>
<p>It is not clear where the vaccine came from, although team officials insist nothing improper was done. It appears it was administered to the players in their quarters at their home arena, the <span class="companylink">Ricoh</span> Coliseum.</p>
<p>MLSE chairman Larry Tanenbaum is also vice-chairman of the board of directors of Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. He did not respond to a request for comment, but Lyn Whitham, the hospital's vice-president of communications, said Mount Sinai did not distribute the vaccine to any sports teams.</p>
<p>After Tlusty spent the past week with the Leafs, the fear that he may have exposed the NHL players to the virus prompted the team doctors to make the vaccination available. However, none of the Leafs questioned yesterday was willing to admit they had a shot.</p>
<p>“We're not going to comment on medical stuff. That's really not our cup of tea to talk about,” said Leafs forward Matt Stajan, who also declined to say whether the players were ordered by management not to talk about it.</p>
<p>Leafs head coach Ron Wilson said the issue was “an internal matter.”</p>
<p>“I'm not going to discuss personal medical situations with anybody,” Wilson said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>More than half of vaccine doses sitting in storage; Millions of available flu shots have yet to be injected because Ottawa's early approval meant provinces weren't ready to deliver them</b>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA and TORONTO -- Fewer than half of the available doses of H1N1 vaccine have been administered to Canadians, leaving millions of vials in warehouses or health-unit fridges across the country while people anxiously wait for their shots.</p>
<p>By the end of the week, 6.5 million doses of vaccines will be in circulation, with at least 1.8 million to come next week, according to federal officials.</p>
<p>However, numbers compiled from government sources show that provincial authorities have so far injected fewer than three million doses, or less than half of the available supply.</p>
<p>While blame for the lack of progress in getting needles into arms has fallen on everyone from the federal government to the provinces and the vaccine maker, public health officials said yesterday that the provinces weren't ready because they thought Ottawa's approval process would go more slowly.</p>
<p>Perry Kendall, British Columbia's public health officer, said delivery of the shots is lagging because of Ottawa's quicker than expected approval of the H1N1 vaccine. The infrastructure for administering the inoculations, which includes volunteers and vaccinators, was ready to begin rolling on Nov. 9, but Health Canada gave its approval the week of Oct. 26.</p>
<p>“We had to kind of flex around the date. We weren't at the capacity that we would have been had we not received the vaccine till Nov. 9 or even this week,” Dr. Kendall said yesterday.</p>
<p>The province had planned on delivering 450,000 doses a week, and hopes to have gone through its current supply of more than 800,000 by the beginning of next week. The undistributed vaccine is in warehouses, in trucks on the way to clinics and doctors' offices, or sitting in the fridges of health units waiting to go.</p>
<p>Maureen Baikie, deputy chief medical officer of health in Nova Scotia, said clinics are running more smoothly as the campaign moves along. When the vaccine comes in to the province, it has be repackaged and distributed to local public health authorities, who then deliver it to clinics, which takes time. “You can't give it all at once,” Dr. Baikie said.</p>
<p>Critics have said that the federal government and GlaxoSmithKline Inc. did not produce enough vaccine and underestimated the crowds at delivery sites. But federal officials said “there are no shortages,” and that the provincial authorities are responsible for the lineups.</p>
<p>“There will be another 1.8 million doses available next week, which is a lot more than what the provinces are able to deliver at this point,” Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in the House of Commons. “This is by far the largest-scale and quickest vaccination the provinces have ever attempted in this country. Rather than criticize them, I think we should encourage them in their work.”</p>
<p>GSK president Paul Lucas defended his firm's handling of the vaccine production, saying his plant in Quebec City is running 24/7. “We cannot afford to compromise on the quality of this product, and we will not,” he told reporters in Ottawa.</p>
<p>The Ontario government has distributed all of its vaccine supply to the province's 36 local health units. But progress in inoculating the 3.4 million high-risk people at the front of the line has been slow and uneven.</p>
<p>Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, told reporters yesterday she is aiming to use all its available doses by the end of this week. Only “several hundred thousand” people have been inoculated so far, Dr. King said, citing a shortage of vaccine as the reason for the slow progress.</p>
<p>But opposition members blamed the government, saying the province has a delivery problem, not a supply problem, and questioned whether 2.2 million people can be vaccinated by the end of the week.</p>
<p>“This rollout has been horrendous,” said New Democratic Party Leader Andrea Horwath.</p>
<p>In the National Assembly, Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc acknowledged that authorities mistakenly vaccinated prison inmates ahead of target groups such as children.</p>
<p>“That was unacceptable,” he said.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, the Liberals have launched a number of attacks in the hopes of pinning the blame on the Conservatives for the massive lineups across the country.</p>
<p>The government has proudly responded that Canada has more doses of vaccine per capita than any other country.</p>

<p>VACCINATIONS / PROGRESS THUS FAR</p>
<p>Of the 5.8 million doses of vaccine delivered so far across Canada, less than half had been administered. The federal government also bought 200,000 doses of unadjuvanted vaccine, produced by the Australian company CSL Ltd., for pregnant women. That vaccine is being distributed to provinces and territories this week.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO and CALGARY -- Pregnant women, young children, people with underlying health issues – and hockey players?</p>
<p>Canada's national pastime has elbowed its way ahead of the groups considered most at-risk of serious illness or death from the H1N1 flu virus. Ranging from minor leaguers in Moncton to pros with the NHL's Calgary Flames and Toronto Maple Leafs, players are jumping the queue and getting the shot. Some teams are defending the action, with the Maple Leafs saying it received vaccine through “normal distribution.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, outrage has spilled over. An Alberta government official identified only as “the most senior staff member involved” in the Flames vaccination was fired yesterday, five days after players and their families were offered the shot at a private clinic.</p>
<p>The province said the “special treatment” was “unacceptable.” New Brunswick's medical officer of health also said last night the minor-league Moncton Wildcats erred in vaccinating its team last week.</p>
<p>Most teams have denied the action is queue-jumping, saying the athletes are high-risk. But Canada's chief public health officer disputed that, saying there's a difference between being at high risk of getting the flu, and of it causing serious illness or death.</p>
<p>“We have focused the priorities of who is to be immunized first based on who is at greatest risk of severe disease and dying, not on who is more likely to be exposed,” David Butler-Jones wrote in an e-mail to The Globe. “Otherwise, school-aged kids would have been the first priority.”</p>
<p>Biomedical ethicist Arthur Schafer agreed. “Athletes are absolutely not at greater risk,” said Prof. Schafer, director of the University of Manitoba's centre for professional and applied ethics. “In times of perceived health crisis, our near-universal sense of fair play dictates that neither wealth nor celebrity should buy you special access to life-saving care. Those who use their wealth or celebrity to jump the queue are thus attacking one of the most fundamental values of Canadian society and are legitimately reviled.”</p>
<p>The Alberta decision to vaccinate the Flames “was a serious error in judgment on the part of the staff involved,” said Stephen Duckett, president and chief executive officer of the board governing health delivery in Alberta.</p>
<p>The Flames have stayed quiet on the scandal.</p>
<p>The club's minor-league team, the Abbotsford Heat, was offered the vaccine after five players fell ill.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the local Fraser Health Authority said the move was “certainly not sanctioned” and reiterated hockey players aren't generally considered high-risk. B.C.'s provincial health officer, Perry Kendall, plans to speak with the team doctor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Leafs insisted “no preferential treatment was requested nor received.”</p>
<p>In Moncton, 25 players and several staff were vaccinated, contravening New Brunswick's policy of prioritizing high-risk populations in the face of a looming vaccine shortage. “We have quite clearly communicated that such teams and sports groups, and so on, are not in the priority group,” said Eilish Cleary,” New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>The Toronto Raptors basketball team said yesterday some of its players got the shot. A spokesman said there was no preferential treatment. The team is owned by the same company as the Maple Leafs.</p>

<p>Toronto -- I had the privilege of attending several presentations on how the media handled SARS reporting. Speakers discussed being swept up by the reporting hurricane, rushing from one news event to the next without much understanding of the impact they were having on the public, not to mention internationally.</p>
<p>H1N1 is the top story in almost any print media or news cast. Not all these stories are relevant, interesting or informative; I can't say I really wonder if Margaret Atwood is getting vaccinated, for example (Apathy, Anxiety And Acceptance – Oct. 31).</p>
<p>As a parent of three, there's much to be concerned about other than fielding daily questions from my seven-year-old about whether she and her brothers are getting vaccinated. Most parents I know are confused, if not confused and anxious, about how to interpret all the “hype.”</p>
<p>Perhaps a short lesson from SARS reporting is in order? The frenetic approach isn't helpful.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vote to kill gun registry exposes rural-urban split; Rural MPs break Liberal, NDP ranks to endorse Tory bill; Ignatieff says he supports decriminalizing the long-gun registry</b>
</div><div>BILL CURRY   </div>
<div>863 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

   </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The House of Commons dealt a major blow to the federal long gun registry last night as 20 Liberal and NDP MPs broke ranks with their leaders to endorse a Conservative bill that would bring the program to an end.</p>
<p>The vote exposed clear splits among Liberals and New Democrats along rural and urban lines, as the 12 NDP and eight Liberal MPs who voted with the Conservatives were primarily from rural ridings.</p>
<p>Many of them had been the target of an aggressive Conservative lobbying campaign that flooded their ridings with anti-registry pamphlets from Tory MPs, as well as Conservative Party radio ads.</p>
<p>“I was just blown away by the support we got,” said Conservative MP Garry Breitkreuz, who led the battle against the registry while in opposition. He helped write the private member's bill that won approval last night to be studied by a committee. “I'm relieved after 15 years, finally we get some action on one of the biggest boondoggles in Canadian history.”</p>
<p>Both Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff and NDP Leader Jack Layton gave their MPs a free vote, even though both party heads officially support the registry.</p>
<p>After the vote, the two parties were sharply criticized by Wendy Cukier, president of the Coalition for Gun Control, who was in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>“It's appalling,” she told reporters yesterday evening. “It wasn't even close. You had urban MPs not stand up for gun control. … Many Canadians are going to wake up [today], I predict, and will be absolutely horrified.”</p>
<p>Conservatives expected the vote to be close. They were clearly surprised by the size of the 164 to 137 win.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Mr. Ignatieff said he supported decriminalizing the federal long-gun registry.</p>
<p>In the highly polarized debate that has raged in Ottawa for years, Mr. Ignatieff said his party is working on a proposal that would find a middle ground.</p>
<p>One of the main criticisms of the registry is that law-abiding hunters could, in theory, become criminals for failing to properly fill out the registry paperwork.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Ignatieff nor his staff would offer further details, but past advocates of decriminalizing the registry have suggested the criminal provisions could be replaced with non-criminal fines.</p>
<p>“It's not the end of the registry tonight,” Mr. Ignatieff said yesterday, dismissing the vote as “mischief” on the part of the Conservatives. “The fundamental issue is to make sure that we get a system of gun control which works both for rural Canada and for urban Canada.”</p>
<p>Yesterday's close vote was triggered by a private member's bill from Conservative MP Candice Hoeppner, who took up measures proposed earlier by Mr. Breitkreuz. The bill is essentially the same as a Conservative bill introduced in the Senate but not moved for debate.</p>
<p>If further debate on Ms. Hoeppner's bill moves quickly, the Conservatives' efforts to scrap the long-gun registry could succeed before Parliament's summer recess in June. The bill's future will also depend on whether Prime Minister Stephen Harper fills upcoming vacancies in the Senate so that the Conservatives outnumber the opposition in 2010.</p>
<p>The bill, if passed, would eliminate the requirement to register hunting rifles but would maintain the registry for prohibited or restricted weapons such as handguns.</p>
<p>Many rural opposition MPs bristled in recent weeks at the attacks from Conservatives in their ridings, but still voted for the Tory bill.</p>
<p>One Tory flyer mailed into the Timmins-James Bay riding, held by NDP MP Charlie Angus, pictured Mr. Ignatieff, Mr. Layton and Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe above a heading stating: Attacking Farmers and Hunters.</p>
<p>Mr. Angus was among the 12 New Democrats who sided with the Conservatives yesterday.</p>
<p>“Every day, people bring [the flyers] into my office and say, ‘Tell these guys to stop using our taxpayers' dollars to lie to us,' ” Mr. Angus said.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>No pair</p>
<p>Bloc Québécois MP Claude Guimond wore a face mask in the House of Commons last evening because he feared he was coming down with H1N1 and did not want to infect his fellow MPs.</p>
<p>Bloc spokesman Carl Boisvert told The Globe and Mail that his party twice approached the Conservatives to “pair” Mr. Guimond's vote so the ailing MP from Montmorency-Charlevoix would not have to attend. “They refused both times.”</p>
<p>Pairing is a Parliamentary tradition in which two parties on opposing sides of an issue agree to have one MP each abstain.</p>
<p>According to the Conservatives, all of their MPs were too eager to be on record for such an important vote. Criticizing the federal long-gun registry has been a central theme of Conservative campaigns for years.</p>
<p>“We had no member to pair with,” said Prime Minister spokesman Andrew MacDougall. “All our members were present to vote.”</p>
<p>Mr. McDougall said the government agreed to move up the timing of the vote so that Mr. Guimond could leave sooner.</p>

<p>Could we please stop all the bleating and whining about the waits for the H1N1 flu vaccine?</p>
<p>Honestly, how long do people think it takes to develop, test, manufacture and package 50.4 million doses of vaccine?</p>
<p>How long do people think it takes to distribute those doses across a country as massive as Canada?</p>
<p>And how long do they think it takes to administer vaccine to the 34 million people who could potentially get it?</p>
<p>Wading through the letters to the editor, the posts, the political rhetoric and the often self-serving recommendations from interest groups on how to resolve the “crisis” in H1N1 immunization, one cannot but despair at the unrealistic expectations placed on public health, and on science.</p>
<p>Sorry, folks, but real life is not a CSI episode, where scientific Gordian knots are unloosed in one hour flat, with time to spare for romance and a half-dozen commercial breaks.</p>
<p>Swine flu (H1N1) first came to light in March of this year. The new virus was isolated and genetically decoded in record time.</p>
<p>Then, with very little firm information on how the pandemic might evolve, key decisions needed to be made: Was this a real threat? Should a vaccine be developed? If so, how much should we buy?</p>
<p>In the real world, it takes about six months to produce industrial quantities of vaccine. You harvest some seed stock and then you grow the virus in eggs. It takes time.</p>
<p>Canada decided early to err on the side of caution and invoke its pandemic preparedness plan. That includes ordering enough vaccine to immunize 75 per cent of the population with two doses each.</p>
<p>That was a $400-million decision and it was the right decision. To second-guess it now because the H1N1 is not as lethal as it might have been is disingenuous.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the fall. Production of the actual vaccine actually begins. There have been no delays. The vaccine started rolling off the production line at <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> in Ste-Foy, Que., in October. It had to be tested and then held for a certain time to ensure there is no contamination.</p>
<p>Sensibly, the vaccine went first to the farthest reaches of the country and last to areas closest to the plant. Naturally, all 50.4 million doses were not available at once. Rather, there will be an average of three million doses a week through December.</p>
<p>Then came the hard part: Getting the vaccine into people – the right people. Because stock is limited, there was a need to set priorities. The process for this is laid out in the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan whose goals are 1) to minimize serious illness and deaths and 2) to minimize social disruption.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there have been some glitches. But, examined dispassionately, the mass immunization has hardly been a disaster. In fact, at least three million people have already received the vaccine and we're still in the early days of the rollout.</p>
<p>The main difficulty has been the impatience of the public. Underlying the stampede to flu shot clinics has been the illogical notion that everyone can be first in line.</p>
<p>Public-health officials have perhaps not been clear enough in their messaging. From the get-go, they have said there will be vaccine for everyone. They have perhaps not emphasized that this availability would be spread out over a period of 12 weeks, and there would be waits.</p>
<p>The greatest frustration has been the long lines. The question is: Were they avoidable?</p>
<p>In the ideal world, absolutely; everybody and their dog has offered up suggestions on how the immunization clinics could have been better run. Many of these suggestions imply that there is no other health care to deliver in this country but flu shots to healthy people.</p>
<p>In Canada, we have built ourselves a tremendous sickness care system. But, despite the lessons of SARS, we have a pretty clunky, under-funded public-health system. It can do the basics like routine immunization but has no ability to carry out massive short-term projects like a universal pandemic immunization program.</p>
<p>There is no surge capacity, no easy way of shifting resources so there can be well-staffed, around-the-clock flu vaccine clinics. The suggestion that priority patients get bracelets is a good one, but where is the information going to come from in a system without electronic health records? Sending the vaccine to family doctors is great in theory too; but are they going to drop everything to give shots?</p>
<p>There is no ability – meaning time and money – in our current system to plan ahead. If the clinics look like they are being run by the seat of the pants it's because they are.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada and provincial health agencies have little or no power, and a laughable amount of resources. Clinic locations and staff were begged and borrowed. Nurses are doing yeoman's work but they can't vaccinate a million people a day.</p>
<p>We have a wonderful pandemic plan but good intentions are not enough.</p>
<p>Today, we are reaping the harvest of decades of under-funding of public health.</p>

<p>The Toronto Star's Thomas Walkom, meanwhile, takes umbrage at the corporate bigwigs -- ptooey! -- getting immunized "in swish circumstances" at Toronto's Medcan clinic, where they don't have "to endure the hoi polloi." But he at least realizes this isn't really about the H1N1 vaccine, but rather about "the succession of provincial governments that allowed Medcan and similar clinics to, in effect, use a legal loophole to circumvent statutory bans on extra-billing for medically necessary services." Precisely. Again: There is a very serious discussion waiting to be had on the future of Canadian health care, but that can't be had until Canadians divest themselves of the myriad misconceptions and romanticizations of its current state.</p>

<p>In the Montreal Gazette, L. Ian MacDonald explores the constitutional implications of mass vaccinations. (Well it's about time somebody did. Yeesh!) He then argues Quebec is doing a pretty good job rolling out the H1N1 jab, but suggests Michael Ignatieff's "impassioned address on the role and responsibilities of the national government" was undermined by Alfred Apps' "hysterical missive comparing the H1N1 situation to Hurricane Katrina" and by one of his advisors, disguised as Joe Everyman, pitching pro-Liberal agitprop at a CBC camera.

<div id="hd"><b>Smelly, But It Works; The flu is in the news, but the common cold hasn't gone away:Here are some strategies to keep it at bay</b>
</div><div>Jennifer Sygo   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>966 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>AL4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>With all the H1N1 talk, the nation's focus is definitely on flu season. But with so much attention being given to treating the flu, it seems the other big winter illness -- the common cold -- is getting less attention. While the common cold is typically the gentler sickness of the two, it is still a drain on us, both as individuals, and as a wider population.</p>
<p>To protect ourselves from getting a cold or the flu, physical barriers usually rule the day: Handwashing, not sharing cups or water bottles and avoiding public places are strategies that we hear about over and over again.</p>
<p>But what about your diet? Is there anything you can take that will lower the chances of getting a cold? And once you're in the clutches of one, is there anything that can shorten a cold's duration or make its symptoms less severe?</p>
<p>VITAMIN C</p>
<p>After decades of recommendations based largely around the prevention of scurvy, vitamin C made its way into our collective consciousness with two-time Nobel laureate Linus Pauling's assertions that mega-dosing was a pathway to good health. Now, many of us don't think twice about popping several thousand milligrams at a time, and there is a widely held belief that taking vitamin C at the onset of a cold will hold it at bay.</p>
<p>But what does the research say? In 2007, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews -- basically, the granddaddy of evidence-based reviews on medical research -- published an updated review of vitamin C and the common cold, and found that, in a nutshell, yes, taking vitamin C regularly can reduce the length one suffers from a cold -- by 8% in adults and 14% in children. But when taken after the onset of symptoms, there was no effect on the length or severity. In other words, mega-dosing on vitamin C after you feel your first sniffle doesn't seem to do much.</p>
<p>Although the general population may not benefit from taking vitamin C for a cold, there is some evidence that athletes training at a high level (marathon runners, for example), and those exposed to extreme cold temperatures can benefit from popping a few pills.</p>
<p>VITAMIN D</p>
<p>The sunshine vitamin plays a role in immune system function, and at least according to early evidence, it might help prevent respiratory tract infections. In fact, a study published in the February edition of the journal Archives of Internal Medicine found that individuals with a lower circulating level of vitamin D had a higher likelihood of developing a respiratory tract infection.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a more recent study, published in the October issue of Epidemiology and Infection, found that subjects given 2000 IU of vitamin D over a 12 week period were no less likely to develop a respiratory tract infection. Since there is very limited research on the role vitamin D plays in the development of the common cold, the bottom line is that we simply don't yet know enough to be able to do anything but speculate. But since so many Canadians are vitamin D deficient by late fall or early winter -- when cold and flu season hits full stride-- taking a vitamin D supplement probably isn't a bad idea, even if it is for other health benefits than cold prevention.</p>
<p>GARLIC</p>
<p>Long used by numerous cultures for taste and health, garlic's antimicrobial and antiviral properties have earned it a reputation as a classic cold-fighter. But does the evidence agree? According to a Cochrane review published earlier this year, researchers found that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that garlic should be used to either prevent or treat the common cold. Again, however, there haven't been enough well-controlled trials to allow a clear conclusion to be drawn, one way or the other.</p>
<p>In fact, in one double-blinded trial, subjects given garlic pills containing 180 mg of allicin (the active compound in garlic) for 12 weeks developed only a third as many colds as those given a placebo (dummy pill) for the same amount of time. Since double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials are considered the gold standard for proof, the results would certainly suggest that garlic has a role to play, at least in cold prevention, but more good trials are needed.</p>
<p>ZINC</p>
<p>A known immune system modulator, there is some research to suggest zinc can be used to manage respiratory tract infections, pneumonia and the common cold. While there is some indication zinc supplements might be most beneficial for children and the elderly, the data is inconsistent.</p>
<p>As for the benefits of using zinc lozenges to treat the common cold, the reviewers at Cochrane deemed the data inconclusive. Yes, there are well-controlled trials, and some have demonstrated zinc lozenges can reduce the duration or the severity of the common cold, but others have shown no effect. The difference could be the result of the type of zinc used and its bioavailability (the ability of the body to uptake and use a particular form of a nutrient), but the possibility of bias was also raised. - Jennifer Sygo is a dietitian in private practice at Cleveland Clinic Canada ( clevelandcliniccanada.com),which offers executive physicals, prevention and wellness counselling and personal health care management in Toronto.</p>

<p>Re: Hedy's Latest, editorial Nov. 2.</p>
<p>I've always respected the Post for being reasonably fair and balanced in its coverage, but this editorial's blatantly partisan attack on Liberal MP Hedy Fry was an exception.</p>
<p>What really disgusted me was your reference to her as being an "MP of colour." Hedy has been the MP for Vancouver Center for 17 years -- continuously. She has earned her way to Parliament Hill repeatedly, not by chance, but through hard work and a genuine concern for her constituents.</p>
<p>She may not have made the brightest comment with respect to H1N1, but she didn't deserve to be speared in your head editorial on a Monday morning. Surely there had to be something of greater importance and intellect available for your readers.</p>

<p>Re: Swine Flu And The New 'Weird-ists,' Colby Cosh, Nov. 3.</p>
<p>Colby Cosh has it right when he says, "Doctors deal with the new weird-ism every day." In caring for patients -- in all fields of medicine -- most of us spend more time trying to outdo the damage done by the "weird-ists" than on anything else. Those of us who don't have simply given up, and let whatever may happen to our patients happen.</p>
<p>What amazes me is that people are wary of the advice of a "weirdist" telling them to not trust their garage guy with the maintenance of the brakes on their car, and to instead apply a banana extract to their break pads twice a year.</p>
<p>Why is it that when it comes to their car, people rely on the trained guy, the "expert," but when it comes to their health, and that of their children, they trust the "weird-ist"?</p>

<p>Riding my bicycle to my University of Victoria office I passed the long lineup for an H1N1 flu shot in the gym. Chances are that the average applicant will have to wait two to three hours for the vaccine, outside, in the cold.</p>
<p>The risk of getting pneumonia from this lineup must be larger than that of getting H1N1.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Island Health Authority and UVic should both be ashamed of this setup. There is plenty of room inside the main entrance to the gym, and along the corridors, to set up a line inside, where it's warm. I can guess why this is not being done: Fire regulations, class disruptions, etc.</p>
<p>Sometimes, ladies and gentlemen, it would be fine to be just reasonable, and cut the red tape.</p>

<p>Re: "Why I am still unsure about a flu shot," Oct. 30.</p>
<p>I applaud Jody Paterson's honesty in describing her doubts about the H1N1 flu shot.</p>
<p>As she notes, getting the vaccine is the logical, civic-minded thing to do. Moreover, she has the personal experience of a close relative who is seriously ill and hospitalized due to an H1N1 infection.</p>
<p>Yet she has serious doubts and admits "it is all about having an emotional reaction to the issue rather than a logical one."</p>
<p>The scientific evidence behind the vaccination recommendation is clear, convincing and overwhelming, but Paterson and apparently half of all Canadians plan not to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this type of thinking is not limited to treatment options related to the flu. It is symptomatic of a broader malaise in our society when it comes to analyzing problems and developing appropriate responses based on logic and science.</p>
<p>In this case as with others one needs to look closely at the facts. In contrast with what Paterson suggests, the H1N1 does not look like any other seasonal flu. According to all reports, it is genetically quite different from recent seasonal ones.</p>
<p>Also, it clearly presents a greater risk of serious outcomes, including death, for healthy young people. If we are going to deal successfully with increasingly complex issues in our society, we need to place more confidence in our reasoning abilities than our emotions.</p>

<p>The first torch carrier, Olympian Catriona Le May Doan, described the flame as embodying the ideal of "respect for each other and ourselves." This ideal is universal.</p>
<p>The Games can further this ideal, but only if the community can host them without sacrificing the well-being of its own people.</p>
<p>Any athlete who wishes to participate only if local citizens are not harmed -- physically, economically, and socially -- is helping to achieve this ideal and is an international "ambassador."</p>
<p>British Columbians are being physically harmed ("cleansing" of Vancou-ver's Downtown Eastside, using the limited supply of H1N1 vaccine for Olympic personnel rather than B.C.'s health care workers), economically harmed ($900 million for security alone), and socially harmed (the long list of programs having their funding cut when demand is increasing and current leaders say they are important programs).</p>
<p>This damage will not be carried away in a little miner's lantern after the closing ceremonies.</p>
<p>Alerting the Olympic participants and the public through protest that the universal ideal of respect should be on the gold platform for each event is not a minor blip.</p>
<p>Maybe Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Premier Gordon Campbell would see better ratings if they lead the march for universal respect.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Retired nurses join flu fight; Others pulled from administrative duties to help in vaccination effort</b>
</div><div>Richard Watts   </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>635 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>It took just two shots for retired nurse Laurie O'Neill to feel comfortable working on the front lines of H1N1 mass-immunization clinics.</p>
<p>At the end of the first day, O'Neill was ready to start giving the vaccine to kids, always considered trickier than adults, since they need to be calmed and prepared more carefully.</p>
<p>"It was just like riding a bike," said the 62-year-old former public-health nurse, who was working at the clinic set up at the University of Victoria.</p>
<p>"After giving the first two shots, I was back in the saddle."</p>
<p>O'Neill is one of many retired nurses who answered a call for help with the largest public vaccination campaign in provincial history.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Island Health Authority sent out 400 letters last summer seeking recently retired nurses, those with a still-active licence, or those willing to re-activate a licence to take on some short-term paid work. About 65 responded.</p>
<p>The health authority expects about 3,000 shifts will be required to administer the H1N1 vaccine during the campaign.</p>
<p>Along with those delivering the vaccine, volunteers are on hand screening patients, monitoring queues, giving directions and just helping out.</p>
<p>O'Neill, who has been retired for 14 months, said after a day or two at the mass clinic, she realized how much she'd missed daily contact with other people since she retired. The sense of urgency and working for a common purpose has also been rewarding.</p>
<p>"Everybody here has just been working as a team," said O'Neill. "It's been amazing -- there are no egos involved."</p>
<p>Lesley Moss, the health authority's executive director for quality, research and patient safety and central commander for emergency operations and H1N1, said nurses who perform administrative or other non-clinic duties have also been called upon to help out in the pandemic response. She herself will be taking a shift in the coming days.</p>
<p>"Everyone has just been great, saying, 'Yup, I'm there to help,'" she said.</p>
<p>Using non-clinical staff for the work has helped the health authority keep its clinical staff working in hospitals and other medical settings.</p>
<p>"We have responded very well, and our staff are heroes every day," said Moss.</p>
<p>Debra McPherson, president of the B.C. Nurses Union, said she isn't surprised to hear nurses have come through for the pandemic response.</p>
<p>"I'm biased here but I have to say nurses are probably some of the best citizens in Canada," said McPherson.</p>
<p>"Nurses are always willing to contribute.</p>
<p>"It's just part of the life."</p>
<p>In other H1N1 news:</p>
<p>- Health officials say a two-month-old baby who died yesterday in London, Ont., likely had the H1N1 flu. It's believed to be the first death of an infant possibly related to swine flu in the province. The infant was admitted to hospital on Monday suffering from influenza A. H1N1 is considered to be the only influenza A strain circulating in the community, health officials said.</p>
<p>- <span class="companylink">Canwest Global Communications Corp</span>. announced yesterday it plans to feature on its newspaper websites articles developed by staff from Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children on how to keep children healthy during the flu season. Researchers in California have found the H1N1 virus disproportionately targets the young, and hits them far more severely. The new website is viewable at www.canada.com/sickkids[http://www.canada.com/sickkids].</p>

<p>Alberta's provincial health authority has fired the most senior staff member involved in releasing H1N1 vaccine to Calgary Flames players and their families.</p>
<p>"Like most Albertans, I am deeply offended that this circumstance has occurred," said a statement by Ken Hughes, board chairman of Alberta Health Services, and president Stephen Duckett.</p>
<p>"We set the expectation that this should not have happened and should not happen again."</p>
<p>The name of the senior staff member was not released.</p>
<p>The investigation is continuing to determine exactly how the Flames managed to jump the queue.</p>
<p>"The special treatment for the Flames and their families is unacceptable to us and contrary to all of our existing protocols and processes," said Duckett.</p>
<p>Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services, said he believes the incident was the only such instance of queue-jumping in Alberta.</p>
<p>"We're reasonably certain the incident was isolated, but nothing is 100 per cent," Predy said.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services is the only body in Alberta that receives vaccine doses from the provincial government. The provincial health authority then dispenses it to clinics and hospitals across Alberta.</p>
<p>"It's a deplorable situation," said Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer.</p>
<p>Public outrage over the revelations showed that Canadians' love for a hockey team, even when it includes such franchise stars as forward Jarome Iginla and goaltender Mikka Kiprusoff, only goes so far during a pandemic.</p>
<p>The health agency said it was continuing its investigation and more disciplinary action could be taken.</p>

<p>With three more deaths in B.C. attributed to the H1N1 flu, the debate continues among our readers over the importance of the vaccine and the clarity of the information campaign surrounding it.</p>

<p>I can't speak of the efficiency of the H1N1 vaccine or the conspiracy theories surrounding it, but I can tell you the H1N1 virus is really bad. I've had a resistant form of it trying to kill me right now. It's been 10 days and I'm coughing up blood. Blood is in the mucous of my nasal passages, I can barely breathe and my fever flashes up to 104 F. I've been to the doctor twice and to the hospital once. I was told to isolate myself and take lots of fluids. People, you do not want to get sick from the H1N1 virus. I strongly suggest you get immunized.</p>
<p>Posted by Antishot</p>
<p>Nice to see that at least a few people do some research and can think for themselves. Conspiracies abound -- the food, the drugs, the viruses, North American Union, NWO, RFID implants. Oh! you haven't heard of that one? Don't worry; you'll hear it soon. Enjoy your poison cocktail, er, I mean flu shot.</p>
<p>Posted by TL</p>
<p>We can't change the shortage right now, so to all those who've been unfortunate and not got the shot, stay away from public places, wash, wash and wash your hands, take vitamins to build up your immune system. Don't worry, because stress makes it worse. To the sick, PLEASE stay home, cough and sneeze into the elbow, and think of those who can die from this.</p>
<p>Posted by Flue Boy</p>
<p>H1N1 is a conspiracy to keep the human sheep population at bay. You are being herded into taking a shot that could have heavy medical consequences.</p>
<p>Posted by Re Flue Boy</p>
<p>Flu Boy, get real! Do you really believe a government or any big organization would have the ability to organize anything, much less a conspiracy?</p>
<p>If you don't want the shot don't get it but don't try to lead people like sheep.</p>
<p>You will likely be OK as your exposure is low, as long as you stay locked in your bedroom reading comics.</p>
<p>When the H1N1 is over, you can move on to the 2012 world-ending BS.</p>
<p>Respond to Nurse's view</p>
<p>People need to understand that if you have mild flu-like symptoms you should stay away and don't come and infect others rather than taking medical tests that are not an emergency.</p>
<p>Simple handwashing and common sense goes far when it comes to infectious disease unless you have underlying medical conditions.</p>

<p>Minister of Health Kevin Falcon said those involved with the Olympic torch were given the H1N1 flu vaccine because "they would be travelling all over the province and this would prevent them from carrying the virus from place to place."</p>
<p>What? It takes eight to 10 days for the vaccine to take effect. Therefore vaccinating them will make no difference in reducing the spread of the H1N1 virus. Good hygiene will help, but being active is probably most helpful.</p>
<p>This was plain queue-jumping.</p>

<p>In the United States, cereal giant Kelloggs has been criticized for marketing Cocoa Krispies cereal with a banner that claims the following: "Now helps support your child's IMMUNITY." The popular cereal also boasts -- right on its cover -- yummy richness in a variety of important vitamins, including A, B, C and E.</p>
<p>Kelloggs told USA Today the product was not meant to capitalize on the H1N1 hysteria.</p>
<p>Well, duh! Who would fall for such a transparent ploy? Everyone knows Frosted Flakes is the only true cereal defence against swine flu.</p>

</p>
<p>Forget wrist shots, slapshots and shots on goal. The biggest priority for British Columbia's newest pro hockey team has been flu shots for their pampered players -- while everybody else plays the waiting game.</p>
<p>But unlike the outrage in Alberta, where a senior health-care manager was fired yesterday for approving H1N1 flu shots for Calgary Flames players and their families, the B.C. government doesn't seem overly concerned that the Abbotsford Heat pulled a similar spinorama move in our end of the rink.</p>
<p>The Heat, the Flames' farm team in the American Hockey League, admitted yesterday their team doctor decided most of the players were "high-risk" for contracting H1N1 and sent them off to get to flu shots -- while hundreds of thousands of ordinary British Columbians wait their turn.</p>
<p>The team said yesterday its players were "high risk" because they have to travel a lot and several of their teammates were already sick.</p>
<p>Try using that excuse at your local clinic and see how far it gets you!.</p>
<p>Just because you have to travel for your job, and some of your co-workers have the flu, doesn't put you even close to the front of the line for the scarce H1N1 vaccine, according to the strict eligibility criteria set down by the government.</p>
<p>That didn't stop the hockey team from trying to avoid a trip to the penalty box.</p>
<p>"At no time did anyone from the Abbotsford Heat receive preferential treatment. Nor did they jump a queue," said team president Tom Mauthe. He failed to impress the head referee.</p>
<p>"It was outside of our policy and outside of our priorities," said chief provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall.</p>
<p>"I'm going to have a conversation with the physician and point out that it wasn't an appropriate use of our vaccine." A conversation? That's it? Compare that to Alberta, where the senior official in the Calgary Flames controversy got the axe yesterday.</p>
<p>But Health Minister Kevin Falcon seemed to take a less serious view of our own hockey flu-foorah.</p>
<p>"These kinds of things will happen," Falcon said, though he also said the situation was "concerning" and "doesn't make sense." Here's what doesn't make a sense: The government failing to make it crystal clear that nobody gets special treatment when it comes to this potentially deadly flu outbreak.</p>
<p>When the Calgary Flames flu fiasco broke earlier this week, B.C. Healthy Living Minister Ida Chong was asked whether Vancouver Canucks players and their families would get flu shots ahead of the public, too.</p>
<p>Chong's verbatim answer: "I believe that what is important is that those who need access to this vaccine to mitigate the possible spread will be looked at by our health experts." Wrong answer, minister.</p>
<p>The correct response was a simple one: No. No special treatment and no queue-jumping -- especially for millionaire athletes.</p>

</p>
<p>Heard an online H1N1 claim that sounds too good to be true? It probably is.</p>
<p>The Better Business Bureau says British Columbians are being bombarded by online scammers trying to cash in on their swine-flu fears.</p>
<p>"There is an enormous amount of media coverage regarding the delay in delivery and current low inventory of H1N1 vaccine, which is enough to inspire scammers to take advantage of the public's anxiety about the situation," said Lynda Pasacreta, CEO of the Better Business Bureau.</p>
<p>Pasacreta worried that unsuspecting web surfers will be sucked in by online pitches for supposed flu vaccines and pandemic defence kits.</p>
<p>"At best, these products don't work," said Pasacreta. "At worst, they're dangerous.</p>
<p>"They waste people's money but more importantly, they might keep them from getting medically sound treatment."</p>
<p>Pasacreta encouraged anyone seeking accurate, up-to-date online information to go to the federal government website at fightflu.ca.</p>
<p>The scams come as some British Columbians grow impatient with the wait to get their swine-flu vaccine shots.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall, B.C.'s provincial health officer, said he hopes to make the vaccine available to all British Columbians once the supplier catches up to demand.</p>
<p>Kendall said health costs to the B.C. government are mounting.</p>
<p>To date, B.C. has paid for 4 million swine-flu vaccines at $8 a pop, and 1 million Tamiflu prescriptions at $25 each, for a total of $57 million -- before factoring in associated costs such as distribution and dispensing.</p>
<p>Retired nurses have been called in to help move the lineups along.</p>
<p>It took just two shots for Victoria's Laurie O'Neill to feel comfortable working on the front lines of mass-immunization clinics.</p>
<p>At the end of the first day, O'Neill was ready to start giving the vaccine to kids, always trickier than adults since they need to be calmed and prepared more carefully.</p>
<p>"It was just like riding a bike," said the 62-year-old former public-health nurse, who was working at the clinic set up at the University of Victoria. "After giving the first two shots, I was back in the saddle."</p>
<p>O'Neill is one of many retired nurses who answered a call for help with the massive public vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Island Health Authority sent out 400 letters last summer seeking recently retired nurses, those with a still-active licence or those willing to re-activate a licence to take on some short-term paid work. About 65 responded.</p>

</p>
<p>Provincial health officials reassured the public Wednesday that nobody was jumping the queue when it comes to accessing the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>"The pandemic vaccine is not being provided to private companies, it is only being provided to public health. There may be instances where the seasonal flu vaccine may be available through other health-care providers, but the pandemic vaccine is only being delivered by public health," the province's deputy chief medical health officer Dr. Saqib Shabab told reporters.</p>
<p>Shabab was responding to questions related to a news story that more than 100 businesses in Saskatoon and Regina -- including a number of provincial Crown corporations -- have hired a private company to vaccinate employees and their families for the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The story quoted the CEO and president of Saskatoon-based HealthServ, as saying the Saskatoon and Regina health regions have agreed to provide thousands of doses of H1N1 vaccine to the company, which will send private nurses to administer the vaccine in large corporate workplaces.</p>
<p>"As far as the pandemic planning, once the vaccine is available for everyone who does not have risk factors, like underlying health conditions -- at that time and that time has not come yet -- there may be a role for organizations who give seasonal vaccinations to employees in large corporations to also play a role in giving the pandemic vaccine,'' Shabab said.</p>
<p>"Even if it was to happen, it would not happen in a way that encourages queue-jumping.''</p>
<p>He also assured reporters that large employers would not get the H1N1 vaccine early.</p>
<p>As we head into what is traditionally the peak flu season over the next six to 12 weeks, Shabab urged everyone to take responsibility for protecting their own health.</p>
<p>"What we are seeing is that, in Saskatchewan, we are somewhat behind what is happening in western Canada, and B.C. But certainly we are well on our way to seeing an increase in pandemic H1N1 activity. We are very much at the upsurge of the second wave. On a week-by-week basis, we are seeing increased numbers of mild illness in otherwise well people, including schoolchildren,'' Shabab said.</p>
<p>He urged people to stay home if they are sick, educate themselves about the symptoms of H1N1 and when to seek medical advice or go to the hospital emergency department.</p>
<p>Shabab also suggested that rather than overwhelm the HealthLine (1-877-800-0002) with queries about H1N1 vaccinations, individuals check their health region's website for clinic information.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>SPECIAL CLINIC</p>
<p>The Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region is holding a special pandemic H1N1 immunization clinic on Friday for children, ages five up to and including students in Grade 6 who has underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>Those conditions include: chronic lung or heart disease, asthma, diabetes, cancer, lowered immunity, kidney disease or severe anemia and conditions treated for long periods of time with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).</p>
<p>Healthy children in this age group will not be immunized at this special clinic, but will be eligible to start receiving the H1N1 vaccine next week at school clinics held throughout the region. Consent forms and notifications of the clinics will be sent home by the schools.</p>
<p>In addition, the region will continue vaccinating children six months to less than five years of age, pregnant women of more than 20 weeks gestation and less than 20 weeks if high risk and women up to four weeks post-partum. These clinics will be held Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>The clinics are being held at the former Robert Usher Collegiate, 1440 9th Ave. North and will run from 9 a.m. to 7:45 p.m.</p>
<p>People are asked to bring their Saskatchewan Health cards.</p>
<p>As more vaccine becomes available, vaccinations will be extended to other high-risk groups and then the general public.</p>

<p>DEVELLANO PESSIMISTIC</p>
<p>The Detroit Red Wings' recent surge -- earning a point in seven of its last eight games -- has pushed the perennial NHL powerhouse merely into an eighth-place tie after play Tuesday night.</p>
<p>It's early and no one thinks Detroit is a bad team. But it's an open question whether the Red Wings will be able to earn home ice advantage in the playoffs for an 18th straight year.</p>
<p>"We're going to have to fight just to make the playoffs and it's going to be a grind," said senior vice president Jim Devellano, the first person owner Mike Ilitch hired when he bought the team in 1982.</p>
<p>"To get home-ice advantage would be a miracle. A miracle."</p>

<p>I am in total awe at how people are getting the H1N1 shot without question because the media is scaremongering for a flu that has killed less people than seasonal flu and has already reached its peak. People should at least demand to read the insert that comes with the shot to find out the ingredients and side-effects.</p>
<p>Even the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Neurology have asked all neurologists to report new cases of Guillain-Barre in people who get vaccines this year, according to The Oregonian newspaper.</p>
<p>Let's just forget about the 60 Minutes report from the late '70s where the guy in charge of the safety of the swine flu vaccine warned that it would cause neurological disorders and not to release it, but they did anyway.</p>

<p>Auditor General Sheila Fraser, never one to pull her punches, has delivered a blistering attack on Public Safety Canada, charging that the federal department in charge of disasters is a disaster in its own right.</p>
<p>It would be hard to argue with her, given the evidence. Even though it was established six years ago, in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2003 power blackout that left the entire eastern seaboard in the dark, it still doesn't have a clear picture of its mandate.</p>
<p>Fraser charged in her recent report that Public Safety Canada doesn't prepare for emergencies. It reacts after the fact, and "has not exercised the leadership necessary to co-ordinate emergency management activities."</p>
<p>For Canadians, there's probably no more topical issue right now than the H1N1 crisis, and Fraser was also highly critical of the Conservative government's failure to put a pandemic plan in place. Even though we were warned of the outbreak last spring, the feds did not establish a strategy for dealing with it.</p>
<p>Only one manufacturer has been given the contract to make the vaccine for the entire population. The resulting shortage has led to widespread panic and confusion.</p>
<p>"Certainly an approved plan would have clearly indicated what the role was for Public Safety Canada," Fraser said, pointing out the obvious need to then co-ordinate a strategy with the provinces and municipalities.</p>
<p>One would expect Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan to be mortified by such a scathing critique. Instead, he foisted responsibility for emergency services and disaster management on to the provinces, and H1N1 on to Health Canada.</p>
<p>Van Loan also took the opportunity to remind us that "pandemic management" shouldn't be confused with national disasters and emergencies.</p>
<p>Pardon? Pandemics aren't public safety issues? This doesn't have the potential to be a national emergency if all those leading experts are right?</p>
<p>The simple fact is that this department must shape up or shut down. Anything that compromises the country -- from floods to terrorist attacks to epidemics -- was meant to go through Van Loan's ministry.</p>
<p>Public Safety is supposed to be the lead agency, co-ordinating efforts with the provinces and, in the case of H1N1, Health Canada.</p>
<p>Fraser summed up her review by saying "it's important -- very important -- that the role and responsibilities of Public Safety Canada be agreed to and endorsed in these emergencies."</p>
<p>We couldn't agree more. After six years, it is shocking to learn that Van Loan and his staff don't understand that. Public Safety Canada might be one of the biggest national dangers we face.</p>

</p>
<p>Everything is big at a National Football League game; the tailgate parties, the stadium, the security, the press box, the locker-rooms, the players, the cheerleaders.</p>
<p>My first NFL game was a dream matchup on Sunday between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Giants. While it was far from a classic, the sights and sounds were fascinating. Here is my experience in nutshells.</p>
<p>Advice</p>
<p>On my way to the stadium, I told myself to just pretend I have been here before. (This is unlike some Calgary Stampeders players who seem to think every reception or tackle is their first, but that's another story.) When I arrived at the stadium, I told myself one last time, "We all type our stories one keystroke at a time, so go in there and show them how it's done.'' Then I remembered I didn't have a laptop.</p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>There was one main security check for the media; one of those empty your pockets, look in your bag and get frisked deals. I was so happy that my dirty underwear was in the bag at the hotel. We had to show our passes numerous times throughout the day. My pass passed better than Eli Manning.</p>
<p>Stadium</p>
<p>Arriving in the press box, I walked to a window and looked out at Lincoln Financial Field. It was about two hours before game time and they were already doing a sound check on the referee's mic.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Eagles cheerleaders and one of the teams were warming up. Sorry, I don't remember which team.</p>
<p>I opened my bag, but didn't see my binoculars. I remember when my wife asked if she could help me pack, I said there were three must-take items: 3. passport; 2. credit cards; 1. binoculars. I felt betrayed.</p>
<p>Press box</p>
<p>The press box is about 40 yards long, with four tiers of seating. I was in row four, four seats from being the farthest away from the field. I am not complaining, unlike one of the guys who sat near me. As he joined us, he said he had been relegated "to sit with you boys.'' As he chomped his breakfast, he lamented how he had the same seat for 10 years but now was with "you boys.'' It was the first time I have been a member of a 'you boys' club. I kind of liked it.</p>
<p>There were monitors everywhere and during the pre-game we saw a reporter out mingling with the thousands of tailgaters. The reporter picked up a piece of bacon from a guy's plate and then put it back. Hasn't he heard of swine flu?</p>
<p>Press box food</p>
<p>A long room runs the length of the press box, with a huge seating area and a buffet along one wall. Think of the Sunday breakfast buffet at your favourite hotel or country club times 10. There was bacon, sausage, fruits, salads, eggs and a chef preparing custom omelets. All free. Having eaten breakfast at the hotel, I chose a salad and Mountain Dew. I wondered what would happen to all the leftover food, then saw Tony Siragusa on the field doing a pre-game show. I didn't need binoculars to spot Tony.</p>
<p>That's not the end of the food story; at halftime there was a new round of delights -- roast beef, chicken fingers, chili, salads, fruits and gourmet deserts. I opted for the chicken fingers, more salad, chocolate cake and another Mountain Dew. Americans seem to love Mountain Dew.</p>
<p>The game</p>
<p>I always thought there was no cheering in the press box, but three guys within earshot were not hiding the fact they were pulling hard for the Eagles. That, and eating and discussing their fantasy drafts, put in a good chunk of the next three hours for them. Is there anything more boring than listening to somebody discussing his fantasy team? By the way, how did Matt Ryan and Mike Bell do on Monday night?</p>
<p>One of them complained what a long day it was going to be. He was covering this NFL game and then sliding next door for the World Series. If he wants a grueling day, maybe he should be deployed to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>From where I was sitting, you didn't get a sense of the incredible skill level of the players. There is limited perspective because of the distance from the field, and with plexiglass in front of us, the noise Philadelphia fans are renowned for was all but drowned out.</p>
<p>That said, Donovan McNabb looked terrific and at times Eli Manning played like Michael Bishop. I thought the cheerleaders had a pretty good game.</p>
<p>The post game</p>
<p>I followed the pack of reporters down to the Eagles dressing room. After taking an elevator, we walked down a path with mini fences on each side. Along those fences were autograph seekers, fans and some scantily clad young women who were likely groupies. Newspaper writers don't have groupies. Some TV guys, yes; but newspaper guys, definitely not. Maybe it's our stained shirts; I had Mountain Dew on mine.</p>
<p>Among those waiting was the incredibly charismatic Tiki Barber; doesn't this guy get tired of smiling?</p>
<p>Suddenly a loud voice told us the door was open and into the room we trampled, like a bunch of reporters at a complimentary buffet. The locker-room was about the same size as the press box, with stalls along the walls and a huge empty area in the middle.</p>
<p>I scanned the name plates hanging above the cubicles to see where Michael Vick was sitting. I walked over, but he kept his back to the room while he dressed. He had one carry for four yards and the humiliation of having to take the kneel on the final snap of the game.</p>
<p>When he was done dressing, he quietly slipped out a side door. I never did see his face. I like Michael Vick and make no bones about it.</p>
<p>Members of the media moved from cubicle to cubicle as a group. Once they had interviewed the supporting cast, everyone wanted McNabb, the hero of the day.</p>
<p>After a brief one-on-one interview with Barber, McNabb was ushered into an interview room, similar to one in those hilarious Coors Lite commercials.</p>
<p>I noticed three things at the news conference: 3. What a genuinely nice guy McNabb seemed to be; 2. What a great suit and pair of glasses he was wearing; 1. That I wasn't the only one with a stained shirt.</p>
<p>As I left the stadium to return to my hotel, I thought again about the reporter who had to go from the NFL game to cover the World Series. I wonder if he claimed overtime.</p>

<p>Following is an editorial from the Calgary Herald.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert must resign his cabinet post. He has lost the confidence of Albertans with his botched handling of the H1N1 vaccine program.</p>
<p>The buck ultimately stops with Liepert, who sent Albertans grievously mixed messages, and deflected the blame for the long lineups and this week's clinic closures, while backtracking and flip-flopping on policy statements.</p>
<p>Liepert claimed poor planning was not responsible for the chaos, but it obviously was. He said it was always a priority that high-risk people would get the shots first, but the message given to Albertans was that nobody would be turned away. Naturally thousands of healthy people showed up. If vaccine availability was driving the government's rollout plans, then the messages should have been tailored to reflect that.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach should request Liepert's imminent departure. It would be the first demonstration of leadership shown since the vaccine fiasco unfolded.</p>

</p>
<p>The Montreal Children's Hospital was forced to put all hands on deck in the ER yesterday to handle a larger than normal influx of parents who were worried their kids were sick with the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Concentrating all staff in the emergency triage area necessitated the closing of some out-patient clinics, blood testing and other non-urgent care clinics.</p>
<p>The deployment of staff from other departments in the hospital could continue through the week should the emergency department continue to be flooded with patients.</p>
<p>Patients will be advised by phone where possible when those clinic appointments will be rescheduled.</p>
<p>A statement from the hospital advised parents not to call the hospital and overwhelm the staff confirming the new appointments.</p>
<p>In cases where a pediatrician orders a blood test for a child, the test can be done at a CLSC.</p>
<p>Despite a plea from both the Montreal Children's and Ste. Justine Hospitals last week for parents to stay away except for the most desperate cases of emergency, both emergency rooms saw a heavy influx of patients in recent days.</p>
<p>The death of a 13-year-old Toronto boy last week, presumably from H1N1, ignited a panic in parents who then swamped the ERs.</p>
<p>Nearly three-quarters of about 650 children brought to Ste. Justine and the Montreal Children's Hospital last Thursday had mild, flu-like symptoms, such as elevated temperatures and coughs.</p>
<p>At Ste. Justine Hospital, about 230 children were seen in the emergency room yesterday, down from 325 last Thursday, said hospital spokesperson Mélanie Dallaire.</p>
<p>"We are busy, but not at the stage where we have to close clinics," she said yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Both emergency rooms are normally staffed to treat 180 children a day.</p>
<p>By early evening, things had calmed down at the Children's and there were less than a dozen people waiting in the ER when The Gazette went to check.</p>
<p>"Parents should have confidence in themselves, listen to their instincts and not worry unnecessarily," Dallaire said.</p>

</p>
<p>Calgary --</p>
<p>An unidentified Alberta health care worker who allowed the Calgary Flames hockey team and players' families to privately receive H1N1 vaccinations last week has been fired and more disciplinary action against other staff members may follow, Alberta Health Services announced this afternoon.</p>
<p>“The decision to allow preferential access to the Flames and their families was a serious error in judgment on the part of the staff involved,” Stephen Duckett, who is president and chief executive officer of the board that governs health delivery in the province, said in a statement.</p>
<p>In issuing the short statement this afternoon, Dr. Duckett said distribution of the vaccine is supposed to be equitable to all Albertans.</p>
<p>“The special treatment for the Flames and their families is unacceptable to us and contrary to all of our existing protocols and processes. I apologize for this breach of our duty to Albertans,” he said.</p>
<p>The National Hockey League franchise faced major backlash when it was revealed this week the team jumped the queue for the flu vaccine last Friday. That was a day before the province said it was closing down all public flu vaccination clinics due to a national shortage of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Ken Hughes, board chairman for Alberta Health Services, said he was “deeply offended” by what happened and pledged that it would not be repeated.</p>
<p>“We wanted to make sure that Alberta Health Services got to the bottom of it,” Alberta Health Minister Ron Liepert told reporters, “They did and they did very quickly. I'm sure if they could rewind the clock that all of them would think differently.”</p>
<p>Gerry Predy, Alberta's senior medical officer of health, said he is “reasonably certain” that no other groups besides the hockey club received special treatment.</p>
<p>“But again, nothing is 100 per cent,' he added.</p>
<p>A Calgary Flames spokesman declined comment.</p>

<p>The Alberta government is investigating how most players on the Calgary Flames managed to receive their H1N1 vaccine shots in private last week while thousands of other Calgarians stood in the cold for hours to be inoculated.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Flames said "most" of the team received the vaccine on Friday, a day before tight supplies spurred the Alberta government to restrict inoculations to only those deemed to be at greatest risk.</p>
<p>The team didn't say whether the players were inoculated with the same supply of vaccine Albertans are receiving or if they'd made arrangements to get it elsewhere.</p>
<p>The team insists it did nothing wrong. In a statement posted on the Flames website, the organization said the players "were vaccinated at an off-site clinic within the public system and under the direction of Alberta Health Services."</p>
<p>"Our players did not seek to either avoid lineups or get special attention. They followed the direction of our medical staff and our organization."</p>
<p>So far, the Flames are the only Canadian NHL team to be accused of queue-jumping. The Vancouver Canucks, Edmonton Oilers, Ottawa Senators and Montreal Canadiens all told Global National their players will wait until the vaccine is available to the general public. The Toronto Maple Leafs could not be reached for comment.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ignatieff could be haunted by past musings on royals</b>
</div><div>RANDY BOSWELL    </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>621 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>When Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff meets Prince Charles for talks next week during the future king's visit to Ottawa, the opposition leader may have to do some fast talking to explain the decidedly anti-monarchist views he expressed in 1992 at the time of Charles's separation from Princess Diana.</p>
<p>In the article, published originally in Britain's Observer newspaper and later reprinted in The Gazette in Montreal, Ignatieff - then a leading British-based writer and broadcaster - argued that the future of the monarchy looked "decidedly bleak" and that it was time for the British public to "regretfully but firmly decide enough is enough," and demand a republican-style government.</p>
<p>"We are being told to sympathize with the private grief of the tragic couple," Ignatieff wrote.</p>
<p>"We are being asked to believe that the horrid tabloids are to blame. Buckingham Palace and No. 10 Downing Street smoothly assure us that the couple's private misery need have no constitutional implications.</p>
<p>"Enough of this nonsense. The Royal Family is not doing its job."</p>
<p>Ignatieff's 17-year-old thoughts on the subject of the monarchy arise in the midst of an 11-day, cross-Canada trip by Prince Charles and his second wife, Camilla, the duchess of Cornwall.</p>
<p>The couple's itinerary includes a brief visit with Ignatieff on Nov. 10 during a three-day stop in Ottawa, the last leg of the royal visit.</p>
<p>But the royal visit also coincides with the H1N1 crisis, and Ignatieff spokesman Mike O'Shaughnessy told Canwest News Service that problems with the national vaccination program - not the state of Canada's constitutional monarchy - are the Liberal leader's priority at the moment.</p>
<p>"The leader is focused on the issue of H1N1," the spokes-man stated. "Right now, Canadians are worried about lines for flu shots, not lines of succession. This is not an issue Canadians are focused on."</p>
<p>A prolific writer and distinguished academic before announcing his bid to become a Liberal MP in November 2005, Ignatieff's opinions from his pre-politics career have occasionally sparked controversy - most notably, his statements in support of the U.S.-led war in Iraq.</p>
<p>But his published views on Prince Charles at a time when the heir apparent's marriage was falling apart in full public view were strikingly blunt.</p>
<p>"Listening to the separation announcement, I found myself wondering exactly why this shambles was so magically preferable to an elected presidency," Ignatieff wrote at the time.</p>
<p>"Dignity, authority and respect - all the qualities peeling away from the monarchy by the hour - are there to behold in the distinguished figure of Richard von Weizsacker, Germany's president. He has even used his office to speak for the German liberal conscience. Could someone tell me why the current speaker of the British House of Commons could not do just as well? At least she has no family we would have to endure."</p>
<p>He railed against the "schizophrenic attitude" of the British news media and public: "One minute, the tabloid hounds are licking the royal hand, the next day they are biting it off" - a phenomenon Ignatieff described as "a rabid kind of porno-populism."</p>
<p>He concluded: "Now is the time for the republican tradition in Britain to find its voice again. Such respect for the monarchy as I have makes me believe they deserve a more honourable opponent than rabid porno-populism."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Province failed to learn from SARS outbreak</b>
</div><div>627 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>On dusty bookshelves in many offices at Queen's Park you will find them, multi-volume reports on Walkerton, on Ipperwash, on forensic pathology, on wrongful convictions and more.</p>
<p>They are the work of judicial inquiries, ordered in the white-heat of crisis, usually years and millions of dollars in the making, released in a media spotlight, then consigned, as often as not, to the obscurity of half-measures and good intentions.</p>
<p>The late Archie Campbell understood that it's probably human nature to divert the gaze to other matters once any emergency has passed. But he hoped, and expected, that in matters of pandemics and public health things might unfold otherwise.</p>
<p>Campbell was the judge who led the inquiry into the SARS outbreak in 2003. He died in 2007 at 65, too ill to have attended the release earlier that year of his final report.</p>
<p>But what a clarion call it seems, in hindsight, against just the kind of lost focus and lost momentum that appears to have contributed to last week's H1N1 immunization fiasco.</p>
<p>What happened during SARS, Campbell concluded, was a failure of the system, declines in public health, decay of emergency infrastructure, a starving of resources - all of which occurred through three successive governments of different stripes.</p>
<p>But "SARS taught us lessons that can help us redeem our failures," he said.</p>
<p>"SARS may be the last wakeup call we get before the next major outbreak of infection, whether it turns out to be an influenza pandemic or some other health crisis.</p>
<p>"This is why we cannot forget how bad SARS was."</p>
<p>When Campbell died, then-attorney general Michael Bryant said the judge's report had pulled no punches and that "his thorough work and thoughtful recommendations have made the province a better and safer place."</p>
<p>But Campbell knew better.</p>
<p>He knew mere recommendations couldn't do that.</p>
<p>He knew only commitment and action could. And he knew that required political will - the most difficult of forces to sustain in a business of infinite demand and finite capacity.</p>
<p>That's why Campbell's first interim report in April 2004 ended with such an emphasis not on matters technical, but on political will.</p>
<p>"The decline of public-health protection in Ontario reflects a consistent lack of political will, over the regime of many successive governments and all three political parties.</p>
<p>"It will require significant political will on the part of the Minister of Health and the Ontario government to commit the funds and the long-term resolve that are required to bring our public-health protection against infectious disease up to a reasonable standard.</p>
<p>"It would be very easy, now that the SARS outbreak is over, to put public-health reform on the back-burner. It is a general habit of governments to respond to a crisis by making a few improvements without fixing the underlying problems responsible for the crisis.</p>
<p>"It would be a tragedy if that turned out to be the case with SARS."</p>
<p>"There is no longer any excuse for governments and hospitals to be caught off guard."</p>
<p>When Premier Dalton McGuinty said, as he did yesterday, that in immunizing against H1N1 "there were some places where we didn't do as good a job as should have been done," he acknowledges failure.</p>
<p>When he says "one of the things we need to do when this is all over, is to bring the feds together with the provinces and territories and to ask ourselves questions about how we managed this," he acknowledges a breaking of faith.</p>
<p>With the Archie Campbells, with the Sheela Basrurs, with those who died of SARS. With all the lessons they taught that weren't adequately learned.</p>

</p>
<p>KITCHENER</p>
<p>Diagnosis: Confusion.</p>
<p>Just minutes after hearing on television that an H1N1 immunization clinic was still open Tuesday night, people - many of them parents clutching infants in carriers - arrived at the Stanley Park Community Centre only to find a Closed sign and a pair of security guards turning people away.</p>
<p>Those arriving after 7 p.m. were told there were already too many people inside awaiting shots before the clinic wrapped up at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>"This is ridiculous," said Christine Arndt, trying to get her 13-month-old son Riley vaccinated. "Where's the communication here?"</p>
<p>It was the second time Arndt was turned away Tuesday. Closed signs had gone up in the face of long lines just two hours after the clinic opened at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>"I've heard people are coming in from Toronto to our clinics. When am I supposed to get in this lineup?" Arndt asked.</p>
<p>"Large numbers were turned away at 4 since we were concerned we may have reached the maximum (of 2,000 people)," regional medical officer of health Dr. Liana Nolan explained in an email. "However, due to the fact that many people in line were not eligible for the shot, we were able to reopen the line later."</p>
<p>Nolan said staff did not have to turn away many people when the line closed again at 7 p.m. Nolan was on hand earlier in the day, working with staff outside as they assessed people and turned away those who didn't fit the priority groups.</p>
<p>Susan Neville brought her seven-month-old daughter Chloe in the afternoon but left after seeing the line circling the community centre. She returned just after 7 p.m.</p>
<p>"I figured I'd come later, and they wouldn't turn her away, but I guess they did," Neville said. "It doesn't surprise me, the way the health care system is."</p>
<p>The line started forming early Tuesday morning, despite pleas for people not to come more than an hour before opening. Public health staff scrambled to get through the crowd of hundreds to hand out wristbands and start giving shots to those at high risk.</p>
<p>The focus this week is on the priority groups, which include people under 65 with chronic medical conditions, children between six months and five years, pregnant women, health-care workers and those caring for people at higher risk who cannot be vaccinated.</p>
<p>"We're really being firm on that and we're actually asking," Nolan said. She isn't sure if all those people will be vaccinated by the end of this week. "It's still possible next week's clinics will only be for high risk," she said.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties, Nolan is pleased there is such a demand. "It's a good problem to have. I'm glad people want to get the vaccine."</p>
<p>Kitchener resident Birgit Lingenberg knew she was at risk for getting very sick with the H1N1 virus, and since she doesn't have a family doctor she was among the first in line Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>She arrived before 9 a.m. with her 11-year-old daughter Christian. Both she and her daughter have asthma, and have suffered serious bouts of pneumonia.</p>
<p>"If we can get the protection we need, we really should," Lingenberg said. "If we have to stay till eight o'clock, that's fine."</p>
<p>She wants to do whatever she can to prevent a deadly pandemic. "It is a necessity to be here. It's not a joke," she said.</p>
<p>Ruby Llagas was prepared for a long, cold wait outdoors. She arrived at the centre around 9 a.m. and sat near the entrance bundled up in a blanket on her lawn chair, a book and food at her side.</p>
<p>The Kitchener mother was willing to wait as long as it took to get her children the vaccine. Llagas was saving a place for her children, two-year-old Breinel and 15-month-old Brody. They stayed at home with their father where it was warm, and Llagas planned to call when it was their turn.</p>
<p>"That's the smart way to do it because I don't want them standing in the cold," Llagas said.</p>
<p>Just before 11 a.m., people were allowed to come inside to wait. The 40 or 50 people quickly filled chairs lining the centre's halls.</p>
<p>Julia Sharpe was among the first outside the centre's doors after arriving just before 8 a.m. with her three children and mother. Her six-year-old son Brysyn has asthma, and her younger two children are four and two - putting them all in the high-risk category.</p>
<p>"It's my kid's health," said the Kitchener mother. Her family doctor was not giving the H1N1 shot. The children's grandmother Shirley Leslie has asthma and diabetes and also wanted to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>"Nobody wants to see their kids die or a family member," Leslie said. "It's sad you have to bring the kids out here in the freezing cold."</p>
<p>Leslie thinks it's taking too long to vaccinate those at high risk: "It should have been last week."</p>
<p>People will be given a numbered wristband to give them a rough idea of when they will be vaccinated. Wristbands were not going to be given out until an hour before immunizations started.</p>
<p>Llagas liked the idea of the wristband system, especially if it made the lines move more efficiently. "I think it will help to be more organized," she said.</p>
<p>Andrea Giovinazzo lined up for her seven-year-old son Noah and eight-year-old daughter Ema, who both have asthma. The Kitchener family's doctor is not giving out the shot, and they had no luck at one of the two clinics held on the weekend.</p>
<p>Giovinazzo was determined to get to Tuesday's clinic before the crowd, arriving at 8:45 a.m. She isn't convinced the immunization program is being handled as well as it could be by the region.</p>
<p>"I don't understand why they didn't go into the schools and vaccinate the kids there," she said. Or she thought clinics should be run at polling stations because people know those locations. "They're probably doing the best they can," Giovinazzo said.</p>
<p>Local campuses are doing their part to meet the demand for the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>The University of Waterloo is holding immunization clinics open to the public on Nov. 18, 19 and 20. It held a few last week for priority groups on campus.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Wilfrid Laurier University held the first of six clinics scheduled over the next three weeks for students, staff and faculty. All appointments are filled already. The campus is planning a second round if there are sufficient quantities of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Conestoga College is offering flu shots for staff and students at five clinics on the Doon, Waterloo and Guelph campuses starting Wednesday and into mid-November. This week's are for high-priority groups.</p>
<p>Nolan urges anyone with a family doctor to try and get the vaccine there. About 80 per cent of local family physicians are immunizing their patients for the H1N1 flu. "They're actually doing more immunizing than we are," Nolan said.</p>
<p>As Tuesday's clinic wound down, the Micheli family emerged. It had taken nearly five hours, but parents Umberto and Marylou said they were relieved they were able to get shots for their three children.</p>
<p>"It was poorly run," Umberto Micheli said.</p>
<p>"The screening should have taken place earlier in the day. It would just make a little more sense."</p>
<p>There are two more H1N1 immunization clinics scheduled this week: Wednesday at Jacob Hespeler School in Cambridge and Thursday at the Waterloo Memorial Recreation Complex, both from 2 to 8 p.m. Clinics continue through November.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 vaccine getting bad rap</b>
</div><div>By Lee-Anne Goodman   </div>

<p>WASHINGTON</p>
<p>Suspicion surrounding the H1N1 vaccine is vexing public health officials in the United States, who say getting inoculated against the flu is safe. Some Americans, however, insist it's a new vaccine with potential long-term side effects that cannot yet be known.</p>
<p>A leading government health official said Tuesday that tests on more than 10 million people who have received the vaccine prove that it's safe and effective.</p>
<p>"It really isn't accurate to say this is a brand-new vaccine; it's not," said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>"This vaccine is made exactly the same way as we make seasonal flu every year, with decades of good safety experience."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, fear and outright paranoia persist - evident in everything from popular <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> videos to an ominous warning about a diabolical plot to reduce the world's population with the flu vaccine from famed black activist Louis Farrakhan.</p>
<p>"The Earth can't take 6.5 billion people," Farrakhan said recently. "We just can't feed that many. So what are you going to do? We have to develop a science that kills them and makes it look as though they died from some disease."</p>
<p>And the generation that gets most of its information online has been spooked by a video about a Washington Redskins cheerleader who's been disabled since she got the seasonal flu shot in August. Desiree Jennings's affliction with dystonia, a rare neurological disorder, has shown up on countless websites.</p>
<p>"The cheerleader video on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> really freaked me out," Paula Woodhouse, a student at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said Tuesday.</p>
<p>"I don't know, it seems sketchy to me, to inject some of it into your body. I've had the flu shot before, but this is a new kind of flu, and a new vaccine, and I don't think there's been enough time to see if it's safe."</p>
<p>Kate Hamill, an office worker in New York, is equally nervous.</p>
<p>"I was considering it, but some guy at my office just got one and had a seizure - he probably is allergic, but having to call 911 for him wigged me right out," Hamill said. "I think people who want it should get it, but I'd rather take my chances, as I rarely get really sick."</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Public Safety Canada, the agency charged with co-ordinating the federal response to threats such as the H1N1 flu, has yet to complete its emergency plan, the auditor general says.</p>
<p>Two years after Parliament gave the department responsibility for emergency management leadership, the formal plan has yet to be finished and approved.</p>
<p>There is growing political and public anger over H1N1, as thousands flock to overwhelmed clinics for flu shots - but there's no overall federal plan for emergencies, be they pandemics, floods, blackouts or terror attacks.</p>
<p>In the latest of her periodic reports to Parliament, Auditor General Sheila Fraser said Tuesday that Public Safety is supposed to ensure that federal departments work together in emergencies.</p>
<p>"The aim is to eliminate the potential for confusion when responding in a crisis and provide a federal point for co-ordination," says the report.</p>
<p>Instead, the department is still drafting the policies and rules that would define what it's supposed to do and how it's supposed to do it.</p>
<p>Fraser said it's clear the federal government can respond to crises.</p>
<p>"Are they responding in a co-ordinated way, as effectively and efficiently as they should be?"</p>
<p>Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan said things work well in practice.</p>
<p>"Canada has always coped well with emergencies and disasters."</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, speaking at a news conference in Vancouver, said the government has a pandemic plan and that, "I think we're doing very well in Canada in responding to the pandemic plan."</p>
<p>Van Loan said substantial progress has been made in producing the formal emergency plan.</p>
<p>"Our plans continue to be prepared," he said.</p>
<p>"We've worked well with the provinces and the territories, our co-ordination has worked well, as we saw this spring with the floods in Manitoba and we will continue to improve and enhance and build our emergency management capacity."</p>
<p>Fraser complained that the cabinet has yet to sign off even on the draft plans that exist.</p>
<p>Van Loan said cabinet will approve it.</p>
<p>Fraser said the department did play a part in developing responses to avian flu and H1N1, but hasn't nailed down its role as the central, co-ordinating body for emergencies in general.</p>
<p>Auditor General Sheila Fraser was critical of Canada's federal disaster agency's planning when she delivered her report in Ottawa Tuesday. Sean Kilpatrick, The Canadian Press    </p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine is now available locally for pregnant women, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>Most current vaccine is adjuvanted, which means it contains a booster to stimulate the immune system. There's been public speculation in recent weeks that the adjuvant may be harmful to women in certain stages of pregnancy.</p>
<p>The local public health board has received a modest supply of 1,700 doses of the unadjuvanted version from an Australian source through the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>While supplies last, the unadjuvanted vaccine will be offered at the health board's Mount Forest clinic at 311 Foster St. on Nov. 4.</p>
<p>The unadjuvanted vaccine will also be available at the Guelph clinic, 109 College Ave., and the Fergus clinic at 855 St. David St., on Nov. 5, 6, 9 and 10.</p>
<p>Further, it's offered at the Orangeville clinic, 276A Broadway Ave., Nov. 5, 6 and 9.</p>
<p>Information on clinic times, which vary, is posted at the board's website: www.wdghu.org[http://www.wdghu.org].</p>

<p>H1N1 vaccines</p>
<p>More time seems to be spent cautioning the public than in dealing with the public’s need effectively, so once adequate stocks of the vaccine are confirmed and the need jumps into the millions overnight, may I recommend we haul out the voter lists, substitute vaccination centres for polling stations and cancel gym for two weeks. After all, millions can vote in a day.</p>
<p>Why struggle with dozens of clinics and requests for orderliness when thousands of public/high schools are readily available? The whole building doesn’t have to be sterile, just the needle.</p>
<p>Children/students get the same thing before or after this adult program.</p>
<p>Can family doctors remember which of their patients are pregnant?</p>
<p>Would they need a separate OHIP firewalled computer system installed or could they just phone the expecting mothers guaranteeing them their appointment rather than a place in line at 6 a.m. and a cold latte?</p>

<p>CALGARY</p>
<p>The Alberta government has launched an investigation into how members of the Calgary Flames and their families scored H1N1 flu shots at a special clinic as thousands of people waited in line for the vaccine or were turned away.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Minister Ron Liepert said he wants to know if the shots were "inappropriately diverted" to the hockey players while other Albertans stood in line for hours.</p>
<p>"There is only one supplier in the province and that's us," he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical health officer, said he first learned about the issue through the news media Tuesday and declined to comment due to the investigation.</p>
<p>Ken King, president of the NHL club, said the players and their families received their shots on Friday at a private location. He said the organization contacted Alberta Health Services and requested the clinic based on recommendations from team doctors, the NHL and provincial guidelines in place at the time.</p>

<p>MORE CANADIANS PLANNING TO GET H1N1 VACCINE: POLL</p>
<p>A new survey has found 49 per cent of Canadians said they were planning to get vaccinated against the H1N1 flu, compared with about a third of respondents to an earlier poll who said they planned to get the shot.</p>
<p>Just under half, or 49 per cent, of respondents to the latest Canadian Press Harris-Decima poll reported being at least somewhat concerned about the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Twenty per cent of those surveyed said they were very concerned about swine flu, while 35 per cent reported being somewhat concerned.</p>
<p>A similar poll conducted last month found that just 36 per cent of respondents were concerned about the pandemic threat.</p>
<p>SALT AND SWEETENERS INCREASE KIDNEY RISK</p>
<p>Two studies show a diet high in salt or artificially sweetened drinks increases the risk of kidney function decline.</p>
<p>The first study looked at diet and kidney function decline in more than 3,000 women enrolled in the U.S. Nurses' Health Study.</p>
<p>The researchers found that in women with well-preserved kidney function, higher dietary sodium intake was associated with greater kidney function decline.</p>
<p>The second study looked at the association between sugar- and artificially-sweetened beverages and kidney function decline in the same group of women.</p>
<p>The researchers found an association between two or more servings per day of artificially sweetened soda and a twofold increased risk of faster kidney function decline.</p>
<p>There was no connection between sugar-sweetened beverages and kidney function decline.</p>
<p>HERE'S THE BEST WAY TO QUIT SMOKING</p>
<p>The first head-to-head comparison of different quit-smoking products finds that a nicotine patch combined with a nicotine lozenge had the most success.</p>
<p>U.S. experts say more than other methods -- including antidepressants -- this combination best mimics the actual highs and lows of smoking to help smokers kick their habit.</p>
<p>The study of 1,500 smokers who wanted to quit appears in the November issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry.</p>
<p>OMEGA-3 SUPPLEMENT NO HELP FOR HEART PATIENTS</p>
<p>Patients with heart disease are at greater risk of dying if they are depressed.</p>
<p>And both depression and heart disease are characterized, among other things, by low levels of omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>So scientists wondered whether heart patients with depression might benefit from a dose of omega-3s in their antidepressant medicine.</p>
<p>In a clinical trial, two groups of heart patients taking the antidepressant sertraline (Zoloft) were randomly assigned to receive a supplement of either omega-3s or a corn oil placebo.</p>
<p>The results were "very disappointing," said lead investigator Robert M. Carney, a psychiatry professor at the Washington University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Carney said there was "absolutely no difference" in remission of depression among the patients who took omega-3s.</p>
<p>Studies evaluating the effects of omega-3s on depression have had mixed results, he said, adding, "The evidence isn't strong enough to make any recommendations in my opinion, for people with or without heart disease."</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>The company making Canada's H1N1 vaccine says it has finished producing a special version of the shot for pregnant women and is again focusing its efforts on the vaccine intended for the majority of Canadians.</p>
<p>GlaxoSmithKline was asked to make special batches of adjuvant-free vaccine for pregnant women and the switchover of production lines was blamed for slowdowns in this week's delivery of the adjuvanted vaccine across Canada.</p>
<p>Adjuvants are compounds that boost the immune response to the vaccine, allowing lower doses to be used.</p>
<p>GlaxoSmithKline spokeswoman Megan Spoore says the company is now awaiting Health Canada approval before shipping the adjuvant-free shot and adds the GSK production lines at its Quebec plant have resumed producing the adjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>The company says it has already shipped almost seven-million doses of adjuvanted vaccine and, in the weeks ahead, there will be millions of doses of the swine flu shot coming off the production line.</p>
<p>The manufacturer adds it is very pleased to see the positive response of Canadians to the H1N1 immunization program.</p>

<p>Re: H1N1</p>
<p>Public health officials mandate that only high-risk individuals should have access to the first waves of H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>How do they measure high risk?</p>
<p>Isn't there some consideration to the risk of exposure to the virus in the equation?</p>
<p>While there is little doubt that individuals who are debilitated with chronic illness would be at greater risk of mortality if they contracted H1N1, they will be protected from exposure if they are not in the workforce.</p>
<p>In contrast, our young students and teachers are going to school where there are confirmed outbreaks of H1N1 and thus they are at greater risk of contracting H1N1.</p>
<p>If they are at one-tenth the risk of mortality of the individuals with underlying medical conditions, but are 100 times more likely to be infected, does this not put them in a group that should receive the first wave of vaccination?</p>
<p>This theory would be supported by the apparently higher mortality among preteens to date. Let's get the vaccinations into the schools pronto.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Premier Dalton McGuinty is refusing to bow to opposition pressure to cancel his trip to Mexico in support of the 2015 Pan Am Games and instead stay in Ontario to oversee the continued rollout of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>McGuinty said yesterday the vaccination plans were well under way and have improved markedly from the chaotic scene last week that saw pregnant women and children waiting in line for hours -- at times only to be turned away.</p>
<p>The Pan Am bid "is important, and I have confidence in our health officials," he said. "Our delivery programs are in a better place today than they were last week, and I have confidence that things are only going to get better."</p>
<p>The opposition parties want him to stay in the province during the crisis to show he's taking his responsibilities as premier seriously.</p>
<p>"If there is a crisis, the premier should be in the province," said Progressive Conservative critic Norm Miller. "It would make sense for him to cancel his trip."</p>
<p>NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, whose hometown of Hamilton would benefit from a winning Pan Am bid, acknowledged the vote Friday was important, but added the swine flu is "something the premier needs to be on top of as well."</p>
<p>"I would hope that he's looking at his priorities carefully and keeping an eye on what's happening and is prepared to do what needs to be done," she said.</p>
