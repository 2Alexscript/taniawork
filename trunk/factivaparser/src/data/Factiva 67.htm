<p>Waterloo Region residents are concerned, but not overly anxious about the swine flu, the region's medical officer of health said yesterday.</p>
<p>"There's concern, but not panic," Dr. Liana Nolan said.</p>
<p>The public health unit has set up a hotline to answer any questions, but so far the telephones have not been ringing off the wall, she said.</p>
<p>That will probably change when the region gets its first case, she said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, she told regional council that "things are unfolding hourly" as everyone waits to see what course this international health emergency will take.</p>
<p>"We are still at a point in the outbreak that we don't know which way it will go," she told councillors.</p>
<p>There are no cases in Waterloo Region and all seven cases in Ontario and 19 across Canada are mild, she said.</p>
<p>Later in an interview, Nolan said this outbreak could wane as summer approaches and then reappear in the fall. "It is really unpredictable," she said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the World Health Organization raised the pandemic alert level for the swine flu to five out of six.</p>
<p>When a pandemic is declared, Nolan said the "next million dollar question is how severe is this pandemic."</p>
<p>Two years ago this month, the region unveiled its pandemic plan. So far it hasn't been activated, nor has a steering committee, which would oversee the implementation of the plan, been established, Nolan said.</p>
<p>"It is sort of a readiness for us," she said.</p>
<p>Canadian makers of vaccines are getting ready to manufacture a vaccine once the flu strain is confirmed, she said. A vaccine could take between four to six months to make.</p>

<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>It may be a lonely Cinco de Mayo holiday next week at El Rinconcito Mexicano restaurant in Cambridge.</p>
<p>With all the scary news and rumours about swine flu going around, people appear to be reacting by avoiding Patricia Solis's eatery, illogical as that might be. Even regular customers are nowhere to be seen the past few days.</p>
<p>"This week, it's almost dead," said Solis, a Mexican immigrant who opened her restaurant five years ago. "I don't know if it has something to do with that (the flu) or not. It's nothing to do with us."</p>
<p>There hasn't been a single severe case of swine flu in Canada. That hasn't stopped people from taking steps of questionable prudence in response to the disease.</p>
<p>Public-health officials argue against urging people to wear masks during a pandemic. Masks can provide a false sense of security and can be contaminated by hands and other surfaces.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some consumers are snapping up all of the masks they can find.</p>
<p>"We've sold out of every single category of masks that we have," said Ali Asaria, chief executive officer of Guelph-based internet health store Well.ca. "It's like individuals buying 10s or 20s."</p>
<p>With masks back-ordered, some Well.ca customers are placing large orders for hand sanitizer, Asaria said.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">McCordick Glove & Safety Inc</span>. of Cambridge, which distributes the N95 variety of safety masks, could have sold its entire inventory in two days, said co-owner Dave Huck. N95 masks are supposed to keep out 95 per cent of particles.</p>
<p>Instead of selling out or raising prices, McCordick Glove has put aside its inventory to serve its existing customers, Huck said.</p>
<p>Sonia Tuck of Preston Medical Pharmacy said her store has sold about 100 N95 masks. Many of the buyers have been people preparing for airplane trips, not necessarily to Mexico.</p>
<p>"I don't think it's to the point of crazy yet," she said. "It's more cautious than panic."</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, customers of VIP Travel in Waterloo with plans to go to Mexico are making alternate arrangements, said travel agent Laura Blair. Even people who aren't scheduled to travel for months, such as a group booked for Puerto Vallarta in November, are looking to change plans.</p>
<p>Experts say you can't get swine flu from eating pork, but prices for pigs have been dropping over the past several days, said Keith Robbins, spokesperson for the Ontario Pork marketing board in Guelph.</p>
<p>While some people may be overreacting to the potential pandemic, there is little sign of outright panic.</p>
<p>There has only been a "moderate increase" in calls to local doctors and to the Waterloo Region public health department, said Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, the region's associate medical officer of health.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Consider it an investment in pandemic preparedness that paid off big time.</p>
<p>A new rapid diagnostic test for influenza that was being developed with U.S. government funding and being assessed in a clinical trial spotted the first observed case of a swine flu virus that may be poised to trigger the first flu pandemic of the 21st century.</p>
<p>"It was just an absolute surprise,'' says Dr. Dan Jernigan, deputy director of the influenza division at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, where the virus was eventually identified.</p>
<p>"You talk about a needle in the haystack and happening to have the right needle detector.''</p>
<p>After running somewhere between 50 and 100 diagnostic tests, the system, made by Meso Scale Diagnostics of Gaithersburg, Md., turned up the swine flu virus now spreading through a growing number of countries.</p>
<p>The senior U.S. official who heads the agency that has been stimulating the development of this and other pandemic-related tests, vaccines and antivirals, said his team was thrilled by the fact a product they funded spotted the new virus.</p>
<p>"We're obviously proud," said Dr. Robin Robinson, director for the office of biomedical advanced research and development authority, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. "It did what we thought it would do.</p>
<p>"We invested . . . large amounts of money into different things, so when one of these comes up . . . this is what it was supposed to do.''</p>
<p>BARDA, as Robinson's group is called, knew that during a flu pandemic it would be critical to be able to quickly diagnose people who were actually infected with the pandemic virus.</p>
<p>The group worked with manufacturers, requiring that to get BARDA funding a proposal had to be for a test that would produce a result in 30 minutes, be affordable and be able to detect a variety of known human flu strains.</p>
<p>The tests had to also be able to detect what is known as unsubtypeable flu viruses -- viruses that aren't among the usual battery that circulate in humans.</p>
<p>Novel flu viruses from other mammals can occasionally jump into humans and cause infection. If they start spreading from person to person, they can trigger a pandemic because people have no immunity to them.</p>
<p>The Meso Scale test was developed and sent out to clinical trial to see if it actually worked. One site where it was being tested was Naval Health Research Center in San Diego, Calif., Robinson said. It was set up there in early March. And on March 31, an unsubtypeable virus was reported.</p>
<p>Robinson said the protocol required all flu viruses that couldn't be typed to be sent to a clinical laboratory. The lab couldn't type the virus either and sent it to a reference laboratory in Wisconsin, which sent it to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.</p>
<p>There, a lab run by Canadian Dr. Steve Lindstrom started to study the virus. It wasn't long before the researchers knew they had something really different, Robinson said.</p>
<p>They first spotted parts of the virus that looked like one that has been circulating in pigs in North America for a number of years, a virus that contained swine, avian and human genes. When they looked further, they spotted new genes in the constellation -- two genes previously seen in swine viruses from Thailand.</p>
<p>"It was like: Holy smoke, we have a new virus here,'' Robinson said, suggesting the extraordinary chain of events shows the dividends pandemic planning can play.</p>
<p>"I think what it says -- if you have the products that have the right specificity and the right selectivity and robustness and flexibility built in . . . they're going to do what they're supposed to do. And it did."</p>

<p>MEXICO CITY</p>
<p>What scares Ricardo Hernandez isn't so much that his father-in-law is sick. It's the fear of losing his five-month-old daughter to a swine flu crisis that has this capital city in virtual lockdown.</p>
<p>''My father-in-law is going to be all right,'' said Hernandez, 24, yesterday, as he waited for the older man (who lives with his family) outside the National Hospital for Respiratory Illnesses. Although Jose DeAnda, 53, was feeling somewhat better, yesterday morning was his first opportunity to be examined by a doctor -- and tested for swine flu -- at a hospital.</p>
<p>''My wife and I are very worried the baby has caught something,'' said Hernandez. ''So far she's OK, but babies are very fragile. We just don't know what we'd do if we were to lose her. We don't know anything right now.''</p>
<p>It's the terrible uncertainty of not knowing that is so difficult to bear for Capitalinos in Mexico City. They're wearing masks, washing their hands, going to hospitals, locking up their children and staying at home. But how do you fight something invisible that is already suspected of killing 150 and sickening an estimated 2,500 people across the country?</p>
<p>Greater Mexico City, with a population topping 22 million, is a ghost of its former self. Schools are closed, street vendors are forbidden, public events have been cancelled and gyms, concert hall, cinemas and most stores and restaurants are shuttered. Soccer teams play in empty stadiums, with fans restricted from the game they love.</p>
<p>Even the city's famous traffic jams are gone. One whips from Coyoacan to Polanco in 20 minutes, instead of spending hours in sweltering traffic.</p>
<p>At the Zocolo, the city's historic main square, public health officials have set up big white medical tents to treat the stream of patients that begins daily at dawn. Doctors prescribe what they can: Docsi for the flu, the anti-spasmodic Dicfafena and lozenges for sore throats.</p>
<p>But they, too, are in the dark about the extent of the problem. They know the World Health Organization yesterday upped the global threat level of this swine flu crisis to five out of six, meaning a pandemic is imminent. But here in the country where the disease began, they can't say if it's getting better or worse.</p>
<p>A child tested positive for the swine flu virus, after visiting a pig farm in the eastern state of Veracruz earlier this month.</p>
<p>''The government has done what it can by putting the country on alert. This is now something the world is dealing with,'' said Dr. Guillermo Williams, who'd examined about 300 patients in the makeshift tent in front of the magnificent Metropolitan Cathedral by 2 p.m. The tents are a strange contrast to the grandeur of the hemisphere's oldest cathedral that stands with the National Palace in the square.</p>
<p>Williams is aware Mayor Marulo Ebrard told reporters yesterday cases appear to be levelling off in the capital, but thinks it's early to draw conclusions. He's pleased, however, that there's been no panic to date, simply a sense of powerlessness.</p>
<p>''Awful, I feel awful,'' said Mari-Elena Mendoza Rodriguez, 30, waiting with her husband, Noe Yanez, 37, to be treated at a Zocolo medical tent. ''For six days, I have had a splitting headache and I'm worried it's la gripe porcina (swine flu),'' said Yanez, who works in demolition. Even if he could work, there's no job to go to.</p>
<p>This country can't take any more blows. It's been battered by earthquakes, drug wars, violence, corruption and a recession that's crippled Mexico as foreign industry continues to abandon a once-favoured country.</p>
<p>And now this.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of dollars is being lost daily with businesses on ghost-town footing. It's estimated 450,000 restaurant workers are directly affected, with another 900,000 spinoff jobs lost. Waves of cancellations have hit the tourist industry since last week.</p>
<p>The only humorous aspect (perhaps) is the multitude of comical scenes in a capital that even in distress can't lose its quirkiness.</p>
<p>Immigration and customs officers in masks greet incoming passengers, ''Welcome to Mexico.''</p>
<p>An organ-grinder with a mask churns out his tinny sound on a street corner and orange-suited parking attendants wearing masks wait to deliver cars into cavernous, mostly empty parking garages.</p>
<p>Hotel room service waiters deliver food with masks on and, near the Zocolo, a man chatted through his mask to the masked attendant who shone his shoes at his little stand. Mostly, the city is a ghost of its former self -- except for crowded hospitals with armed guards out front and lineups at pharmacies. Only the automatic weapon-toting guards at department stores and businesses appear lonely, with nothing to do.</p>
<p>At Fray de Nadine Hospital, psychiatrist Dr. Victor Gonzalez says, ''Doctors are doing the best they can telling people what to do to help prevent contamination.''</p>

</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Some residents who recently visited Mexico are ill.</p>
<p>But tests have not detected the swine flu virus that's sparked an international health emergency.</p>
<p>"We certainly have lots of people coming back from Mexico who are sick," said Dr. Liana Nolan, medical officer of health for Waterloo Region.</p>
<p>"That's a common thing. So far, none of them are turning out to be suspect cases."</p>
<p>Testing will continue, Nolan said. There are now seven mild cases of swine flu elsewhere in Ontario.</p>
<p>Swine flu is being watched for its potential to turn into a deadly global outbreak. The public health department has ordered heightened surveillance of travellers to Mexico, where the strain emerged.</p>
<p>People are also reminded to wash their hands often, cough into the crook of their elbow, and stay home if sick.</p>
<p>If the situation worsens, an emergency plan reveals the next public health steps to be taken here.</p>
<p>Authorities will at first consider limiting after-school activities and community sports, and deferring travel to affected areas. This is meant to slow the spread of the disease and buy more time to understand it.</p>
<p>If a deadly outbreak called a pandemic is ultimately declared, authorities may then consider:</p>
<p>Closing schools and daycares.</p>
<p>Implementing emergency staffing plans for governments and businesses.</p>
<p>Discouraging large public gatherings.</p>
<p>Other public health measures have been ruled out as ineffective and impractical.</p>
<p>Most notably, experts say it's pointless to wear a mask if you're healthy.</p>
<p>This seems at odds with the actions of anxious people who are donning masks all over the world.</p>
<p>However, face masks are rarely used properly by the public and experts warn their misuse may do more damage than good.</p>
<p>"Recommending masks for everybody in the community would really not be an effective strategy," Nolan said.</p>
<p>"It really doesn't make a whole lot of sense and doesn't prove to be able to slow down the transmission of the virus."</p>
<p>To be useful, masks must be fitted and worn properly and changed often. They are helpful when used properly in health-care settings and when people are sick.</p>
<p>Healthy people often touch their masks and then their eyes, which could infect them. They don't change masks often enough. They don't keep them around their nose and mouth, pushing them down onto their neck or up onto their face.</p>
<p>This means masks provide only a false sense of security. Masked people may see no need to practise more useful efforts, such as handwashing and covering their cough.</p>
<p>There's also a concern that if healthy people use up too many masks, there may not be enough for health-care settings.</p>
<p>"We're trying to really emphasize the things that work, and encourage people to do that," Nolan said.</p>
<p>She knows healthy people may still choose to wear masks.</p>
<p>"I certainly understand that people are anxious, and people want to feel that they're doing something effective," she said.</p>
<p>Other public health measures that have been ruled out as impractical or pointless in a flu pandemic include:</p>
<p>Setting up hand-sanitizing stations in public places, such as malls and transit stations.</p>
<p>More cleaning of surfaces in public places.</p>
<p>Urging everybody to check for fever at least once a day.</p>
<p>Using equipment in public places to scan thermally for elevated body temperatures.</p>
<p>Disinfecting the clothes, shoes or other objects of people leaving an affected area.</p>
<p>Restricting travel to and from an affected area.</p>
<p>Setting up a quarantine or barrier to stop the disease from spreading.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>On brink of pandemic; Swine flu spreads in Canada and claims first young victim in the U.S.</b>
</div><div>James McCarten   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>1022 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>The United Nations agency that guards the health of humanity moved one step closer to declaring a full-blown pandemic yesterday as swine flu continued its spread in Canada and around the world, claiming its first life outside embattled Mexico's borders.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization increased its alert level to Phase 5, one tier below that of pandemic, as the caseload in the United States jumped to nearly 100 -- including the death of a Mexican toddler in Texas -- and Ontario and B.C. each reported three new cases.</p>
<p>"All countries should immediately now activate their pandemic preparedness plans; countries should remain on high alert,'' WHO director-general Dr. Margaret Chan said from Geneva in a chilling call to arms to governments and agencies around the world.</p>
<p>Maple Leaf's Michael McCain says consumer misconceptions about swine flu probably won't hurt the food processor Business, C5</p>
<p>"This change to a higher phase of alert is a signal . . . that certain actions now should be undertaken with increased urgency and at an accelerated pace.''</p>
<p>Phase 5 of the WHO's six-tiered alert system, with Phase 6 representing a full pandemic, indicates human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region, according to the organization's alert system.</p>
<p>Phase 5 "is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, communication, and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short.''</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief medical officer of health, acknowledged the alarming tone of Chan's announcement, but reassured Canadians that health authorities in their country have a plan in place and that it's being followed.</p>
<p>"I'm sure many people will be anxious upon hearing this. However, for Canada it does not mean a change in what we are facing and how we approach it,'' Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>"As we continue our surveillance, we will find more and more cases, and as for any form of influenza, some will be more severe, and unfortunately we may see some deaths as well.''</p>
<p>A Mexican toddler who died in a Houston hospital after falling ill during a visit to Texas became the first to die from the swine flu outside Mexico, prompting U.S. President Barack Obama -- marking his 100th day in office yesterday -- to offer his "thoughts and prayers'' to the boy's family.</p>
<p>"This is obviously a serious situation,'' and "we are closely and continuously monitoring'' it, Obama said of the spreading illness.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the number of confirmed cases swelled to nearly 100, in 10 different states stretching from coast to coast. A Marine in Southern California was identified as a possible case; 39 others were confined to their base, pending test results.</p>
<p>Six more confirmed cases brought the Canadian total to 19 -- four in Nova Scotia, seven in Ontario, six in British Columbia and two in Alberta. Germany and Austria became the latest European countries hit by the disease. Britain closed a school after a 12-year-old girl tested positive.</p>
<p>In those parts of the world where the virus had yet to materialize, misinformation appeared to be following an equally virulent path.</p>
<p>Egypt ordered the slaughter of every pig in the country and Gabon became the latest country to ban pork imports, despite persistent assurances from all quarters that swine flu cannot be contracted from eating pork products.</p>
<p>Egypt's overwhelmingly Muslim population does not eat pork, but farmers raise some 300,000-350,000 pigs for the Christian minority. Those farmers will still be allowed to sell the meat from the slaughtered animals.</p>
<p>Swine flu is suspected of killing nearly 160 people in Mexico and sickening nearly 2,500 there.</p>
<p>In Mexico City, the mayor said the outbreak seemed to be stabilizing and he was considering easing the city-wide shutdown that closed schools, restaurants, concert halls and sports arenas.</p>
<p>The Canadian Tour, which until yesterday had been planning to proceed with its San Luis Potosi Open golf tournament without caddies or spectators, opted instead to indefinitely postpone all three of its scheduled Mexican events due to health concerns.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said health officials were ordering extra medicine and "several million more'' face masks to deal with the virus.</p>
<p>British media reports, citing an unidentified European surgical mask manufacturer, said the country was seeking 32 million masks to protect its health workers from a possible pandemic.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones, however, warned Canadians away from the use of masks as a preventive measure, as they can often do more harm than good.</p>
<p>"We are not currently recommending that people in Canada wear masks in this situation,'' he said. "Our research shows that wearing masks actually does very little to reduce the spread of infection in the general population, and that improper use may actually increase your risk of getting ill.''</p>
<p>The U.S., the European Union and other countries have discouraged non-essential travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>New Zealand's number of swine flu cases rose to 14, 13 of them among a school group that recently returned from Mexico. All were responding well to antiviral drugs and voluntary quarantine at home.</p>
<p>New Zealand has 44 other possible cases, with tests underway.</p>
<p>Germany's national disease control centre said the country's three cases include a 22-year-old woman hospitalized in Hamburg, a man in his late 30s at a hospital in Regensburg, north of Munich, and a 37-year-old woman from another Bavarian town. All three had recently returned from Mexico.</p>
<p>Austria's Health Ministry said a 28-year-old woman who recently returned from a month-long trip to Guatemala via Mexico City and Miami has the virus but is recovering.</p>
<p>Cuba eased a recent flight ban, deciding just to block flights coming in from Mexico. And Asian countries greeted returning travellers with teams of medical workers and carts of disinfectants, eager to keep swine flu from infecting their continent.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hospital funding worries voiced; Liberals vote down motion by Witmer</b>
</div><div>Kevin Swayze   </div>
<div>RECORD STAFF</div>
<div>738 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>They carried signs calling for fair health-care funding and chanted with thousands of protesters demanding a moratorium on cuts to rural and community hospitals.</p>
<p>They cheered when opposition politicians denounced the way provincial health dollars are distributed by local health networks.</p>
<p>But in the end yesterday, it appeared the worries 66 Cambridge residents have about their hospital made little impression on the Liberal government inside the Ontario Legislature.</p>
<p>Four hours after 2,000 people from across Ontario got back on buses after a noontime protest, Liberal members voted to kill a motion by Progressive Conservative MPP Elizabeth Witmer.</p>
<p>It demanded the Liberals admit there's a hospital funding crisis and that the government develop a plan to stop the firing of nurses and to erase hospital deficits.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Craig Bailey of Cambridge was optimistic the government would hear his fears about the future of Cambridge Memorial Hospital.</p>
<p>"It made a difference," Bailey said, helping to hold a protest banner over the crowd.</p>
<p>"People in the building cannot help but notice there are people here from across the province who have concerns. I am pleased Cambridge is being proactive instead of reactive."</p>
<p>All the way to Toronto on his bus, Cambridge protesters talked about the compassionate care they've received at Cambridge Memorial, Bailey said. "This hospital is incredible. We can't let it go downhill," Bailey said.</p>
<p>"There's enough of us here -- they'd better hear us," said Francis White, who works in food services at Cambridge Memorial.</p>
<p>Cambridge protest organizer John van der Heyden was "disappointed" with the turnout from Cambridge. "I had more than 100 people, enough to fill two buses, lined up . . . we had 66 people on the buses," he said.</p>
<p>It remained a worthwhile effort for the Cambridge volunteers lobbying to protect Cambridge hospital from budget cuts, he said, after taking his turn to speak to the throng.</p>
<p>"It gives us more insight and experience with rallies," said van der Heyden, who has also organized rallies at the Cambridge Newfoundland Club and in front of the hospital.</p>
<p>"We're not finished with this yet," he said.</p>
<p>Cambridge MPP Gerry Martiniuk and Kitchener-Waterloo MPP Witmer took their turns at the microphone. So did protestors and politicians from the Niagara area, Burks Falls and Wallaceburg, where hospital downsizings are threatened.</p>
<p>In Cambridge, the hospital faces a review by the Waterloo Wellington Local Health Integration Network to shave $3 million to balance its books. Repeatedly throughout the protest -- and in the legislature by opposition members during the later debate -- health networks were slammed as a way for the Liberal government to distance itself from hospital closures and service cuts.</p>
<p>Cambridge hospital closed its pain care clinic, Martiniuk told the crowd as he slammed the government for its lack of health care planning. "They're playing politics with the health care system. They are cutting it by stealth," he said.</p>
<p>Hospital spokesperson Alan Clay said later that the pain clinic remains open.</p>
<p>In the legislature, Liberal members told of the hundreds of millions of dollars in new health care money invested in their ridings since 2003, to heal the system after budget cuts by the previous Conservative government. Liberals also praised the health networks as a good way to give communities a chance to shape their local health care -- not have it dictated by Toronto bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Don't tell that to Jim Shuttleworth of Cambridge, who's been trying for a year to get the Waterloo-Wellington health network to fund stroke rehabilitation programs in Cambridge.</p>
<p>"I've had it with the LHINs, those shadowy groups: there's no accountability," he said as the protest wound down at 1:30 p.m.</p>
<p>"How do we get rid of the LHINs?"</p>
<p>For Cambridge protester Rhonda Bramhill, the solution is simple: give hospitals adequate funding to provide the services people need.</p>
<p>"It just takes more money. Just tax us again."</p>

</div><div>ANDRÉ PICARD   </div>
<div>1105 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail (Breaking News)</div><div>GMBN</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

   </div>
</p>
<p>PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTER</p>
<p>apicard@globeandmail.com (apicard@globeandmail.com)</p>
<p>News reports say a lot of the swine flu deaths are in young adults. Are symptoms actually worse in some groups than others?</p>
<p>There is actually very little hard data on who has been infected with swine flu. As of last night, there were only 26 confirmed cases, including seven deaths in Mexico. Media reports say there are 159 suspected deaths. Either way, we don't know the denominator - how many are actually infected with the virus - so it's impossible to figure out the kill rate or what age groups are affected.</p>
<p>Influenza usually kills the very old and the very young, so flu deaths in young adults stand out and that is why they have attracted attention. But it is possible that babies and older people have died of swine flu but their deaths were attributed to other respiratory ailments such as pneumonia. The other reason that deaths among young adults raise alarm bells is that the Spanish flu, the biggest infectious disease killer of all time, is said to have affected young men disproportionately. But, again, this is largely anecdotal.</p>
<p>You said there was no risk of contracting swine flu from pork. So why have some countries banned the importation of pork products from Canada, the United States and Mexico?</p>
<p>Swine flu is not a food-borne illness. Eating pork poses no danger. Yet, the Philippines has banned Canadian pork imports. And Egypt has ordered the slaughter of all swine. These decisions have nothing to do with health and everything to do with politics.</p>
<p>Governments are happy to exploit health scares for political gain. Banning imports will bolster the domestic Filipino pork industry.</p>
<p>And eliminating pigs from a predominantly Muslim country is an easy way to score political points or, in a more sinister interpretation, a sly way to deal a blow to religious minorities.</p>
<p>If swine influenza A/H1N1 is a new virus, how exactly was the new virus created?</p>
<p>Pigs, birds and humans all suffer regularly from influenza. All three species can be found, to varying degrees, on pig farms. Pigs are sociable animals. As such, they are perfect mixing vessels, allowing for a reassortment resulting in a new strain of virus. That virus was then passed on to a human - probably a farm worker - which is unusual.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the swine influenza H1N1 is an "unusually mongrelized mix of genetic sequences." It is composed of parts of four different flu viruses: North American swine influenza, North American avian influenza, human influenza, and swine influenza virus typically found in Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>Because this particular combination is unique, people have no immunity, which gives it the potential to spread globally.</p>
<p>Does an early case of mild swine flu immunize one against a more severe case should this become a fully-fledged pandemic?</p>
<p>People who are infected with swine influenza H1N1 will have immunity, or at least partial immunity, should there be a full-fledged pandemic.</p>
<p>But influenza viruses mutate constantly - they can become more or less severe.</p>
<p>Should I reconsider air travel to Europe and elsewhere in the next month? What are the chances of picking up the virus in a plane?</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada has urged Canadians to avoid "non-essential" travel to Mexico, the country hardest hit by swine flu.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has not recommended any travel restrictions.</p>
<p>The other part of the question is: Does airline travel place you at higher risk of infection?</p>
<p>While airplanes have a bad rap, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that air on-board is actually better than in office buildings and homes.</p>
<p>On big commercial flights the air is exchanged every three to four minutes (compared with five to 12 minutes in offices and homes) and it is filtered. The level of pathogens in airplane air is about the same as that in shopping malls, city buses and airline terminals.</p>
<p>The catch, however, is you may be stuck in close quarters with someone sick.</p>
<p>If someone is coughing forcefully, as they would do with a serious case of swine flu, people within two to three rows would be in harm's way.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>INFLUENZA A</p>
<p>Most common cause of flu in humans.</p>
<p>Hemagglutinin (HA protein) H of H1N1 enables virus to attach to receptor on host cell.</p>
<p>Virus core - nucleocapsid</p>
<p>Eight single strands of RNA (ribonucleic acid) contain genetic blueprint for replication.</p>
<p>Neuraminidase (NA protein) N of H1N1 promotes budding - release of newly formed virus particles from host cell. These spread infection within victim.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>Inside the flu virus</p>
<p>The Mexican swine flu virus is a mixture of four different strains: North American swine flu, North American avian flu, human A/H1N1 flu and a swine flu strain found in Asia and Europe</p>
<p>Reassortment</p>
<p>If different viral types infect host cell at same time, new viruses budding from cell can contain jumbled mixture of RNA strands. New subtype emerges abruptly</p>
<p>Human immune system</p>
<p>"Old" antibodies no longer recognize "new" HA and NA proteins. They may also trigger cytokine storm - harmful immune overreaction in body that may be lethal in itself</p>
<p>New RNA genome</p>
<p>Virus now has potential to spread rapidly between humans</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>Analysis of swine flu indicates NA protein should be sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors Tamiflu and Relenza</p>
<p>Neuraminidase</p>
<p>inhibitors - Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) and Relenza (zanamivir)</p>
<p>stop budding process</p>

</p>
<p>As a member of the media (though not quite so en-membered as to have my own blog) I'll do what I can to hold up my end of the panic.</p>
<p>So, wait for it now -- SWINE FLU. RUN FOR YOUR LIVES.</p>
<p>There. I even used capital letters. Don't you hate this?</p>
<p>Our tulips came up the other morning, the first of them anyway. You know, you're just standing vacantly on the sidewalk, having picked up your elastic-bound torpedo of "dying medium" (i.e. newspaper), metabolizing some breakfast, waiting for someone to happen along and tell you what to do next ("You're still in your pyjamas, Mr. Mahoney; maybe you should go in and get dressed").</p>
<p>Then you see them, on confident green stems -- painted cups in the garden. Tulips. They weren't there the evening before, at least not open like this. So rounded and inviting you want to pour a few ounces of sunny burgundy into the bowl of their corolla and toast the spring (but it's not even 8 and you shouldn't start drinking before the liquor stores are open).</p>
<p>You want to stop someone and say, "The tulips are up. It's not all hopeless." But no one is around except for three joyless men halfway down the street who have just been disgorged from a van, dull canvas bags full of flyers strapped over their shoulders. Probably surgeons in their country of origin or maybe let-go auto executives repositioning themselves in the contingent labour market. They'll fan out in the neighbourhood, making strategic decisions about how far to respect the NO FLYER notices on the doors. One of them is coughing.</p>
<p>When you open the newspaper, headlines about swine flu bloom across the page. Tulips of alarm. It's in Toronto now. This is terrible news. Not just because Toronto is the centre of the universe, but because the people who live there have no core fund of rationality to which authorities can appeal.</p>
<p>In Mexico City, as most of us have heard, soccer teams were playing to empty stands, their fans having been cautioned to stay away because of the swine flu scare (and I'm assuming the players didn't kiss each other after scoring). They're soccer fans. They're not stupid.</p>
<p>It's one thing to be trampled to death in a postgame stampede. That's worth the risk, to see a shootout after a nil-nil tie. But flu symptoms? Unendurable, perhaps even un-Mexican. If you went to a soccer game and were unlucky enough not to die, the physical contact of a stampede could result in headaches, persistent coughing. Worse than death.</p>
<p>SWINE FLU UPDATE: Spokes-organisms representing the swine flu announce startling new mutation. The bug now has claws to snip through fabric. You can throw away those stupid-looking masks.</p>
<p>So the Mexicans stayed home.</p>
<p>This kind of thing could never happen in Toronto. The building could be engulfed in flames. If the Leafs were playing, Torontonians would put their bums in the burning seats. They've flocked together season after season for teams so bad that it depletes electrolytes and makes the eyes bleed to watch them. And still the fans keep coming back. They pay to come back. Swine flu? Pfft. Throw in a touch of Ebola while you're at it. Let it spread like pink eye in a day-care centre. Leaf fans are zombies. Masks? For sissies. Leaf fans don't even wear bags over their heads.</p>
<p>Hamilton is the opposite. Hamiltonians will stay away from anything for any reason. "Honey, wanna go to Jackson Square?" "Nah, I heard there might be as many as one goth with body piercing at King and James. I'd rather not risk it. Besides, where would we park?"</p>
<p>Hamiltonians don't congregate. We don't even go to work at Stelco anymore. We don't go downtown. <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> is going more and more drive-thru.</p>
<p>Come smell the tulips. Listen to the music of the songbirds on the budding boughs of spring. We in Hamilton are better equipped to deal with the coming pandemic than almost anyone.</p>
<p>If the dreaded bug were to land in Hamilton it would feel like the German army marching through the abandoned city of Stalingrad, in one of those world wars.</p>
<p>The microorganisms would say to each other, "This feels like a trap. Where are the crowds for us to communicate ourselves through? Creepy. Let's get out of here."</p>
<p>There's always a silver lining. Look, a robin pulling on a worm.</p>

<p>Burlington golfer Michael Gligic was to arrive home today after the Canadian Tour called off three golf tournaments in Mexico because of the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>He was to play in San Luis Potosi, which is believed to be one of the hot spots of the outbreak.</p>
<p>The Tour said it was "working diligently with its travel partners to bring its members and officials home as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Steve Gligic, Michael's father, said last night he was "glad" his golf-loving son was leaving Mexico. They had debated him staying, and had a deal he would leave if it got worse. Gligic said it reached that point when Tour officials learned airports they were set to use were being closed and golfers could have been stuck in Mexico for 40 days. He said his son had initially downplayed any concern, but his attitude did change after he got to San Luis Potosi.</p>
<p>"They're banning caddies and everyone is walking around with masks," said Gligic. "Once he got there, right in the middle of it, he wanted to come home."</p>
<p>His son is flying into Toronto this morning from Mexico City.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu alert level raised; Canada confirms 19 'mild' cases: seven in Ontario</b>
</div><div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>630 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A07</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.   </div>
</p>
<p>The number of Canadian swine flu cases increased to 19 with the confirmation of six new cases -- three each in Ontario and British Columbia.</p>
<p>And while the majority of the cases across the country involved people who recently travelled to Mexico, both Ontario and B.C. had one case each where the travel history wasn't immediately clear.</p>
<p>All the cases were mild, but Canada's chief public health officer David Butler-Jones said that as surveillance continues he expects more cases and perhaps deaths as well.</p>
<p>In Geneva, the WHO raised its pandemic alert to Phase 5, one step short of a full pandemic.</p>
<p>The increase in the alert level may make Canadians anxious but donning surgical masks in public and giving healthy people antiviral drugs would only make matters worse, said Butler-Jones yesterday in Ottawa.</p>
<p>"I'm sure many people will be anxious upon hearing this, however, for Canada it does mean a change in what we are facing and how we approach it," he said.</p>
<p>"We already have cases in Canada and, as we continue our surveillance, we will find more and more cases. As for any form of influenza, some will be more severe and unfortunately we may see some deaths as well."</p>
<p>Butler-Jones advised people not to start wearing masks in public, with the exception of patients in hospitals and clinics who are displaying flu symptoms and health-care workers.</p>
<p>"Our research shows that wearing masks actually does very little to reduce the spread of infection in the general population, and that improper use may actually increase your risk of getting ill," he said.</p>
<p>Antiviral drugs should be reserved for the seriously ill or those at high risk of influenza complications.</p>
<p>"Inappropriate use could increase the risk of resistance and the drug would not be as effective if we needed it in the event of more severe illnesses," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>Officials at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control said the three new cases involved people who had "direct contact with Mexico."</p>
<p>"Two out of the three have travelled back from Mexico recently. The other has had extensive contact with travellers," said Dr. David Patrick, the centre's director of epidemiology services.</p>
<p>In Ontario, six of the seven Ontario residents diagnosed with swine flu had recently visited Mexico, but officials are still not sure about the seventh person.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said there has been an increase in the presence of quarantine officers at Canadian airports that have direct flights from Mexico arriving.</p>
<p>"As the situation evolves, we will continue to evolve our response."</p>
<p>The WHO moving to Phase 5 is less important to Canadians than what local officials report about potential person-to-person transmission in the community, said Dr. Vivek Goel, chief executive of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion.</p>
<p>"We're already at the level the disease is present in our country, the next issue is to going to go to community-level transmission from person-to-person and that's probably what the public should be looking at more. Right now we do not have evidence in Ontario of community transmission."</p>
<p>The 19 confirmed cases across Canada included four in Nova Scotia and two in Alberta. One person in B.C. was hospitalized overnight.</p>
<p>Public health officials said the three Ontario women added to the list yesterday are all in their 20s -- the same age group as the first four Ontario cases -- and all are mild cases of the flu.</p>
<p>The three cases are from York, Durham and Peel regions, which all border Toronto.</p>

</p>
<p>Hamilton has no confirmed cases of swine flu, although public health officials said yesterday they are investigating a new case of a resident who recently returned from Mexico.</p>
<p>Dr. Elizabeth Richardson, Hamilton's medical officer of health, said the previous three local cases under investigation have been ruled out as having the A/H1N1 influenza, a strain that originated in Mexico and is believed to have killed 159 people and sickened more than 2,500.</p>
<p>It will be several days before health officials confirm whether this new case tests positive for the virus. The sick Hamiltonian has been told to self-isolate until laboratory tests are complete, said Richardson.</p>
<p>Hamilton health officials have also set up a new telephone hotline for residents to deal specifically with questions about this new virus. People can call 905-546-2424, ext. 7970, between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Monday to Friday to speak with a public health nurse.</p>
<p>The hope is that a hotline will prevent some of the disruption that's occurred at local emergency departments, such as healthy individuals who've walked into ERs looking for masks. Call the hotline instead, advised Richardson.</p>
<p>"ERs and family docs can look after sick people and we can take care of some of those people who just have questions."</p>
<p>And please, if you have mild flu symptoms, visit your doctor, not the ER, said Dr. David Price, Chief of Family Medicine at <span class="companylink">Hamilton Health Sciences</span>.</p>
<p>"The emergencies will quickly become overwhelmed if everybody with mild influenza symptoms go to the emergency."</p>
<p>All family physicians in Hamilton are getting daily e-mail or fax updates every afternoon and local hospitals have begun to limit visitors. Only one person is allowed to accompany a patient into the local ERs, except when the patient is a child. Until further notice, only two visitors are being allowed into hospital rooms at a time. This is done to minimize the volumes of people in the ER and minimize the risk of infection, said Dr. David Higgins, chief of staff at St. Joseph's Healthcare.</p>

<p>Don't count on those disposable masks to protect you against swine flu.</p>
<p>Residents of Mexico City, as well as air travellers have turned to mouth and nose protection of one type or another in recent days in an attempt to stop errant airborne viruses from entering their respiratory tract.</p>
<p>3M, a major producer of surgical masks and respirators, said worldwide sales have increased significantly.</p>
<p>Masks may give people a false sense of security, said Dr. Laurene Mascola, director of acute communicable disease control for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>"You would have to wear it 100 per cent of the time that you are outside," she said of masks and respirators.</p>
<p>Further, face masks and respirators shouldn't replace other precautions.</p>
<p>To avoid infecting others, ill people should stay home, avoid crowds, cover their mouth when they cough or sneeze, and wash their hands before touching eyes, nose or mucus membranes. Those who want to avoid infection should do the same.</p>
<p>According to 3M, standards show how well respirators filter out particles in industrial settings, but there are no established exposure limits for biological agents such as swine flu virus.</p>
<p>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has nine classifications of respirators based on their ability to filter particles. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends respirators classified as N95 for health-care workers and other people caring for someone, such as a family member, with a respiratory infection.</p>
<p>CDC officials don't know how helpful either type of covering is in preventing swine flu infection.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Proposed bill would prevent current airline frustrations:MP; Cancelled Flights</b>

</p>
<p>A proposed Passenger Bill of Rights being considered by Ottawa would have prevented many of the aches and pains experienced by consumers this week when Canadian tour operators and airlines abruptly cancelled their flights to Mexico, according to Jim Maloway, the Manitoba NDP MP who authored the bill.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation, which will be up for its second hour of debate in the House next Thursday, would force carriers to offer passengers a full refund on their travel in the event of a last-minute cancellation, or offer to reroute them to their destination on another flight, if approved.</p>
<p>"The bill handles this very, very well," Mr. Maloway said. "The penalty for the airline not complying would be $1,000 payable to the customer."</p>
<p>While <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. did offer its passengers a full refund on their trips to Mexico, many of the other tour operators, including <span class="companylink">Transat A. T</span>., Sunwing Vacations, <span class="companylink">Signature Vacations</span>, and Air Canada Vacations simply offered to postpone flights or send them to another one of their destinations.</p>
<p>Any difference in the cost, however, would rest on the shoulders of the customers, the carriers said, and no refunds would be granted for trips that were less expensive. In addition, the new bookings, in most cases, would have to be made before the end of October, the carriers said.</p>
<p>Almost all Canadian carriers have halted their flights to the country, due to swine flu concerns, until late May or early June. WestJet responded further yesterday by offering discounts of $100 to customers who book flights to the Caribbean and Hawaii, and discounts of $50 for tickets to southern U. S. destinations such as Florida and Arizona.</p>
<p>The flight postponements announced yesterday have left thousands of customers across the country with their vacations, weddings and business trips suddenly upended.</p>
<p>The proposed bill will go before a vote in the House, tentatively slated for May 13, before it would go before committee if approved. The Liberals, the Bloc and the NDP have said they would support the bill going to committee.</p>

<p>OTTAWA - Call it the H1N1 virus, the Mexican flu, a pandemic or just a panic -- but whatever you call it, Canadian pork producers would really, really like you to stop calling it "swine flu."</p>
<p>With public health officials around the world scrambling to contain the new virus, pork producers are bracing for a market collapse along the lines of what happened to Canadian beef exports after an Alberta cow tested positive for mad cow disease in 2003.</p>
<p>Despite repeated assurances from public health officials that this new hybrid flu strain only appears to be transmitted between humans, the fear is already taking hold in international markets. Russia, China and more than a dozen other countries have banned pork imports from countries affected by the outbreak.</p>
<p>Egypt ordered the immediate cull of all pigs in the country yesterday, despite efforts by the EU to reassure consumers that the pig-farming industry poses no danger to human health.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the Canadian Pork Council sent a letter to Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, urging her to start referring to the bug as "North American influenza," in a late-game attempt to lift the stigma from the pork industry. As of yesterday afternoon, the industry hadn't received a response.</p>

<p>• Dutch health authorities have confirmed a first case of swine flu in the Netherlands in a three year-old who had recently returned from Mexico, the health ministry said today.</p>
<p>• Switzerland today became the latest country to report a swine flu infection — a 19-year-old student health officials said was mistakenly released from a hospital and then hastily re-admitted.</p>
<p>• European Union health ministers today will discuss co-ordinating over possible restrictions on travel to and from Mexico following the outbreak of swine flu, Czech Health Minister Daniela Filipiova said. A European Commission official has said EU countries can impose individual travel restrictions but the executive cannot impose an EU-wide ban.</p>
<p>• Mexico took even more drastic action to squelch the swine flu, ordering a suspension of private business activity and non-essential federal government activities. In a televised address, Mexican President Felipe Calderon praised “the heroic work” of doctors and nurses and asked his countrymen to literally stay in their homes between May 1 and May 5, saying “there is no safer place to protect yourself against catching swine flu than in your house.”</p>
<p>He brushed aside criticisms that his government's response was slow, stressing several times that authorities had reacted “immediately.” School in Mexico has already been cancelled until May 6. During the shutdown, essential services such as transport, supermarkets, trash collection and hospitals will remain open. Mr. Calderon said authorities would use the partial shutdown to weigh whether to extend the emergency measures, or “if it is possible to phase out some” restrictions.</p>
<p>• U.S. President Barack Obama promised “great vigilance” in confronting the outbreak that has sickened nearly 100 people in 11 states and forced schools to close.</p>

</div><div>By Murray McNeill   </div>

</p>
<p>Manitoba's punch-drunk hog industry has taken another upper-cut to the jaw after the swine-flu scare sent hog prices tumbling this week.</p>
<p>"I've lost roughly $12 to $13 per pig since Monday," Manitoba Pork Marketing Co-op (MPMC) president and Selkirk-area hog farmer John Preun said in an interview Wednesday.</p>
<p>With Manitoba producers selling about 100,000 slaughter hogs a week, that would translate into an industry-wide loss of about $1.3 million weekly if prices remain at that level, Preun said.</p>
<p>"That's big, big money. We just can't sustain these types of losses."</p>
<p>He and veteran Dugald hog farmer Bill Vaags said Manitoba producers were already reeling from a flurry of body blows suffered over the last three money-losing years. They included low hog prices, high feed costs, an earlier run-up in the value of the Canadian dollar and last fall's adoption of new country-of-origin-labelling (COOL) rules in the United States, which dramatically reduced hog and weanling sales to that key export market.</p>
<p>Manitoba Pork Council general manager Andrew Dickson said that in 2007, Manitoba producers shipped about 1.3 million slaughter hogs to the U.S. This year, they'll be lucky if it's 150,000.</p>
<p>That same year, they also shipped about 120,000 weanling pigs south of the border, and this year the number is expected to fall to 80,000, he said.</p>
<p>Preun and Vaags predicted if prices don't rebound soon, some Manitoba farmers will be driven out of business.</p>
<p>"We'll start to lose them pretty fast because they're down on their knees already," Preun said. "One more blow and their bank will say, 'enough is enough.'"</p>
<p>MPMC general manager Perry Mohr said the province has already lost 500 to 600 hog producers over the last three years -- there are roughly 800 compared to approximately 1,300 to 1,400 in 2006.</p>
<p>He said $145 is the average break-even price for most Manitoba hog producers, and over the last two years they've been getting an average of only about $128 a pig. That's left many of them financially vulnerable.</p>
<p>He said the regular spring run-up in prices had barely got underway when this flu scare hit late last week. Industry officials were expecting prices to climb as high as $155 to $170 a pig over the next three or four weeks. Now it's anybody's guess where they'll go, although Mohr said they did stabilize Wednesday at about $127.</p>
<p>What's particularly galling to local industry officials is that this particular flu hasn't even affected pigs. Dickson said it was called swine flu because some of the same genetic materials found in this flu can be found in other swine, bird and human flues.</p>
<p>"And there's no threat to public health by eating pork," he added. "I'm just finding it very frustrating and it's very stressful," Preun said. "We are in an industry that seems to be under attack from all angles."</p>
<p>Manitoba's chief veterinarian, Dr. Wayne Lees, said unwarranted trade restrictions invoked by several countries are having a huge impact on the industry. Lees stressed that the virus is infecting humans, not pigs, and that pork is still safe to eat.</p>
<p>There have been no reported cases of human swine flu in Manitoba pigs.</p>
<p>The attack continued Wednesday when more than a dozen countries joined Russia and China in banning imports of pork products from parts of the United States and Mexico where the flu has been detected. Some countries, including Indonesia, have even been destroying pork products already imported from those areas.</p>
<p>So far, the bans haven't been extended to Canadian pork products, so Manitoba exporters haven't been directly affected, Mohr said. But they've been indirectly impacted because the bans have driven down U.S. hog and pork prices by about 10 per cent since Monday.</p>
<p>murray.mcneill@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Inside the industry</p>
<p>Manitoba is Canada's largest pig-producing and pig-exporting province. Here are some facts:</p>
<p>Manitoba producers sold about 9.4 million pigs in 2008, of which 5.8 million, or 62 per cent, were sold out of province.</p>
<p>Last year, local pig producers and brokers exported about 1.2 million slaughter hogs and 4.3 million weanling/feeder pigs directly to the United States.</p>
<p>Manitoba is Canada's third-largest exporter of processed pork products after Quebec and Ontario.</p>
<p>Japan and the United States are the two largest export markets for Manitoba hogs and processed pork products, accounting for 55 per cent of last year's pork exports.</p>

<p>The financial impact on tour operators and airlines cancelling trips to Mexico amid the swine flu outbreak will be muted somewhat by a seasonal move that reduces flights to sun destinations and boosts service in Canada and Europe, says David Newman, an analyst at <span class="companylink">National Bank Financial Inc</span>. “You have the stragglers booked to go to Mexico and it's a much-reduced tour program now, with most of the winter travel season behind us, frankly,” Mr. Newman said yesterday. Planes are being deployed away from Mexico at this time of year, “but at this juncture, we're not sure how extensive the damage could be from the swine flu.” While there have been quick rebounds in the past whenever air traffic slumped, the tourism industry is still concerned about rattled consumers scaling back travel in general later this year, beyond cancelled Mexican trips in May, he said.</p>

<p>Another two golf tournaments in Mexico have been postponed because of the country's swine flu outbreak. The Nationwide Tour said yesterday its Mexico Open, scheduled to begin May 21 at El Bosque Golf Club in Leon, will be played later in the season. The Canadian Tour put off this week's Luis Potosi Open yesterday, a day after postponing two other events in Mexico in May. The events will be rescheduled. The tour is acting quickly to get golfers organizers away from the contagious area, officials said.</p>

</p>
<p>CALGARY and EDMONTON -- Regan Peterson picked up her dress, visited the salon and was about to get a manicure before tomorrow's flight to Mexico with fiancé Aaron Brooks, but instead of enjoying last-minute preening, the-bride-to-be spent yesterday scrambling to find a new tropical locale for a beachside ceremony.</p>
<p>Swine flu has scuttled the Lethbridge, Alta., couple's plans for a May 12 wedding with 33 guests at a resort in the Mayan Riviera. Now, their tour operator, <span class="companylink">Signature Vacations</span>, is trying to book something else, possibly in Jamaica or the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>“It's frustrating not knowing what's going to happen,” the 27-year-old music teacher said. “… Now I'm just kind of laying in bed not doing anything, just on the Internet and getting all the phone calls because it was ringing off the hook.”</p>
<p>The swine flu epidemic, with the bulk of cases in the Mexico City region but the source of the virus still unknown, has resulted in international travel bans to a top-ranked sun destination. It's the last thing Mexico's tourism industry, which brings in $13.3-billion (U.S.) a year, needs now – especially as travel companies say May and June are popular for destination weddings.</p>
<p>Ken Wong, a marketing professor at the Queen's University School of Business in Kingston, said a recovery could be “problematic” because “this already builds on existing concerns people had about Mexico,” including negative perceptions about its crime and water supply.</p>
<p>Mexico is already fighting the stain left by drug cartels, which have been blamed for thousands of deaths, including the killings of judges, police and innocent bystanders.</p>
<p>It also faced international scrutiny after a series of bizarre deaths of tourists, notably for the murders of Canadians Domenic and Nancy Ianiero of Woodbridge, Ont., found with their throats slashed at their Cancun-area resort in 2006. Nobody was ever charged.</p>
<p>Then, on Monday, the United States issued an advisory for travellers to postpone non-essential travel to Mexico. Canada and other countries followed suit.</p>
<p>Some airlines have stopped flying there and cruise lines such as <span class="companylink">Royal Caribbean Cruises</span> are temporarily avoiding Mexican ports.</p>
<p>It's all quickly grinding down the country's third-largest source of foreign currency after remittances and oil revenues. According to the Mexican government's tourism department, 9.5 million foreigners visited the country last year, with the majority coming from the United States. Canada makes up the next biggest market, with 1.14 million visitors in 2008.</p>
<p>Now, it's critical for Mexican officials to prove to the international community that they have found and contained the source of the outbreak and then take measures to correct it, Prof. Wong said.</p>
<p>Updated information about swine flu on the Mexican government's tourism website is scant. By yesterday afternoon, the most recent posting was a Saturday press release stating that there were no travel restrictions to the country.</p>
<p>Mexico tourism officials based in Canada weren't available to reporters yesterday.</p>
<p>After the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, which claimed 44 lives in Canada, most of them in Toronto, the city's hospitality industry immediately stepped into high gear. Advertising was ramped up to reassure travellers that the SARS threat was over and deals were rolled out to woo back tourists. The most important thing, tourism officials in Toronto say, is to get the conversation back to the strengths of the destination.</p>
<p>Some in the travel business are confident Mexico will rebound. “Once we get past this, people will be going back,” said Dianna Izak, a veteran travel agent with Newwest Travel in Edmonton. “I mean, it's something that can happen anywhere.”</p>
<p>But right now most people are heeding the warning because their travel insurance would not cover them if they picked up the flu during their trip, she added.</p>

</p>
<p>After a nearly week-long struggle by friends and family to bring her home, a Toronto resident who fell ill while on vacation in Mexico died on Tuesday evening at a hospital in Peterborough, Ont.</p>
<p>One week ago, Victoria George, 29, a mother and market researcher who was on vacation at a resort outside Cancun, was put on life support after a severe asthma attack. Her family began a campaign to have her brought home to a Canadian hospital, one they believe was blocked by health officials' fears of spreading the recent outbreak of swine flu in Canada.</p>
<p>By Thursday of last week, the family had arranged for air ambulance, but their insurance provider told them that no intensive care unit beds were available in Ontario.</p>
<p>“This is absolutely devastating to a family, first of all to lose a child, to lose a sister, to lose a wife, to lose a mother, but also the fact it is so difficult to get back this young woman. …We couldn't get her home,” said Ms. George's mother, Pauline George.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Ministry of Health said Ontario did not have a hospital bed shortage, but availability changes hourly, and it was unclear which hospitals Ms. George's insurer contacted.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, family members contacted their MPs, including NDP Leader Jack Layton, who appealed to Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq to facilitate their dying relative's return to Canada.</p>
<p>An ICU bed became available at Peterborough Regional Health Centre and Ms. George arrived there early Tuesday.</p>
<p>She died hours later, surrounded by family, including her five-year-old son, Issac.</p>
<p>“We all definitely need some transparency and some accountability for what has happened to my wife and my family,” Dylan Pazzano, Ms. George's husband, said.</p>
<p>The ministry spokesperson said that no directive was issued to Ontario hospitals not to accept patients from Mexico.</p>
<p>Ms. George's mother and husband both expressed gratitude toward the Peterborough hospital for accepting her as a patient so that she was surrounded by family in the hours before her death.</p>
<p>“She was very articulate, very bright, very much an advocate, a loving daughter, mother and a wonderful wife,” Ms. George's mother said.</p>

</div><div>By Jennifer Loven   </div>
<div>526 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama said Wednesday night waterboarding authorized by former president George W. Bush was torture and the information it gained from terror suspects could have been obtained by other means.</p>
<p>Obama, speaking at a White House news conference capping a whirlwind first 100 days in office, Obama also said progress has been made in rebuilding the U.S. economy but more remains to be done.</p>
<p>"You can expect an unrelenting, unyielding effort from this administration to strengthen our prosperity and our security -- in the second hundred days and the third hundred days and all the days after," he said in opening his news conference.</p>
<p>The president expressed much greater optimism now than a month ago that Chrysler could remain a "going concern," possibly without filing for bankruptcy or with a "very quick" one. Obama did not say so, but Italian automaker <span class="companylink">Fiat Group</span> SpA is expected to sign a partnership agreement with <span class="companylink">Chrysler LLC</span> by today as part of negotiations to keep the U.S. automaker alive (see story on page B5).</p>
<p>The president gave assurance that one way or another Pakistan's nuclear arsenal would not fall into the hands of Islamic extremists. He said he was confident "primarily, initially" because he believes Pakistan will handle the issue on its own. But he left the door open to eventual U.S. action to secure the weapons if need be.</p>
<p>The prime-time news conference was the third of Obama's presidency and the first not dominated by a recession that has thrown millions of Americans out of work.</p>
<p>The news conference lasted an hour and covered topics ranging from the outbreak of swine flu -- which Obama referred to as the H1N1 virus, evidently in deference to U.S. pork producers -- to abortion and the recent flare-up in violence in Iraq.</p>
<p>The president also said he was "absolutely convinced" he had acted correctly in banning tough interrogation techniques including waterboarding, which simulates drowning, and in making public previous administration memos detailing their use on terrorist suspects.</p>
<p>"Not because there might not have been information that was yielded by these various detainees...but because we could have gotten this information in other ways, in ways that were consistent with our values, in ways that were consistent with who we are."</p>
<p>Obama has come under heavy criticism for his actions from former vice-president Dick Cheney and other Republicans. They have urged Obama to release memos they say will show the tough methods were successful in obtaining information.</p>
<p>Obama said he has read the documents Cheney and others are referring to but said they are classified and declined to discuss their details. In a White House exchange with House of Representatives Republican leader John Boehner last week, Obama said the record was equivocal.</p>
<p>Obama's intensive schedule marking his 100th day in office demonstrated the degree to which the administration saw both possibility and peril in the milestone -- a symbolic evaluation point since Franklin Roosevelt took office in the depths of the Great Depression in 1933.</p>

</p>
<p>IF a Winnipegger is suspected of having swine flu, Chief Jim Brennan of the Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service will be one of the first to know.</p>
<p>That's because his Blackberry is linked to the city's First Watch computerized data collection system.</p>
<p>It's a system purchased by the city from an American company that helps officials monitor occurrences based on key words input by dispatchers and paramedics.</p>
<p>Brennan said it could be invaluable for illnesses like swine flu.</p>
<p>"In the world of bio-surveillance, you can put in certain key words, words like flu-like symptoms, fever, chills, Mexico. When words like that are entered at 911 or from a patient, it sends out an alert to the system.</p>
<p>"Calls like that came to my Blackberry all weekend. It gives the managers of the system an idea of the frequency of the calls."</p>
<p>Brennan said the system also has the flexibility to enable deeper analysis of the calls.</p>
<p>"You can lay the calls over a map of Winnipeg and see where the calls are," he said.</p>
<p>"We'll be able to advise paramedics on the areas to take precautions so they can come wearing gloves and masks."</p>
<p>In an email to city councillors in response to a question at Wednesday's city council meeting, Mayor Sam Katz said the city's paramedics department have also set up other procedures on how to deal with calls from people who may be infected with swine flu.</p>
<p>"The WFPS (Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service) has been in contact with peers across Canada to share information on safe procedures to deal with calls from persons who may have the swine flu virus," the mayor said.</p>
<p>Katz said 911 dispatchers will ask questions whether the person has been to Mexico and whether they have a fever.</p>
<p>Katz also said the city has a pandemic plan and is prepared to roll it out if there is a serious outbreak.</p>
<p>The mayor said during the past weekend there were 41 calls to 911 for respiratory ailments, with four of them believed to be serious enough for paramedics to wear masks to the call. None of the four actually had swine flu.</p>

<p>ADAM Speirs didn't want to leave but it's hasta la vista, Mexico, for the Winnipeg golfer.</p>
<p>After saying it would allow the San Luis Potosi Open to proceed despite a swine flu outbreak, the Canadian Tour announced on the eve of the event Wednesday that it was postponing the tournament as the World Health Organization said the outbreak is moving closer to pandemic status.</p>
<p>"I've made arrangements to leave (this) morning at 6:40 to get into Houston -- apparently it's the last flight out of here," said Speirs, one of three Manitobans entered in the event along with Winnipeg's Matt Johnston and Dauphin's Ryan Horn.</p>
<p>"I've been staying with the superintendent of the golf course this week, we're staying at his house. We're very surprised. Everything seems pretty low-key here, not chaotic as CNN would suggest. They did a good job of shutting the golf course down."</p>
<p>Speirs wasn't wearing a surgical mask to protect himself and said he wasn't concerned for his safety or health, although he was washing his hands often. The golfers didn't have contact with outsiders and the caddies usually brought in from Mexico City, about 150km to the south, were told to stay at home.</p>
<p>The players were sharing carts and caddying for themselves.</p>
<p>"It seemed like we were going to go and play but I think the organizers of the tournament said if something does happen, we don't want this on us," Speirs said. "We were on the 18th hole today on our practice round and an official came up to us and said 'Pack it up guys, we're shutting it down.'"</p>
<p>The Tour, in a statement released from Oakville, Ont., said the Open was being postponed indefinitely -- Speirs said until the fall -- and it was "working diligently with its travel partners to bring its members and officials home as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Speirs said that ultimately, the Tour's decision was out of the golfers' control.</p>
<p>"You look at it a couple of different ways... 'Hey, c'mon, nothing's going to happen, so let's play.' But then in hindsight, if something does happen, you might say we should have cancelled it. So it's obviously a little bit on the safe side and I understand it.</p>
<p>"You just don't want to take a chance. If something were to happen, it would be on the Tour and on the organizers and they just don't want that to happen. So it's postponed. We're going to come back here at the end of September or the beginning of October and we'll do it then."</p>
<p>Speirs said that in fact, moving this event and two others in Mexico that were to follow it to the fall might be better. Coming back to Mexico in the fall, after the Canadian portion of the tour this summer, will give players competitive opportunities right before the PGA Tour qualifying school.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Speirs said he's not sure what he's going to do in the next few weeks. His girlfriend was going to travel to Cancun, he said, but that won't happen.</p>
<p>"I think right now it's just getting back to the States and figuring out where you might play or if coming home is the best option," Speirs said. "I'm not really that concerned about it. It's the flu, we get it in North America. Now it's just get to the airport and get back to the States.</p>
<p>"My car is in Memphis right now so I'll make my way back to Memphis at some point and then just figure it out."</p>

<p>Toronto -- • It's too bad so few in the media appear to be paying attention to your estimable health reporter André Picard (Keep Fear-O-Meter On Low For Now – April 29). If they did, they would not be breathlessly reporting every new case of swine flu as a step toward Armageddon.</p>
<p>As Mr. Picard notes, a steady increase in flu cases is expected before they tail off. What we are experiencing is an “infodemic” of reporting, largely without meaningful context.</p>
<p>What is relevant is whether new cases are growing at a rate larger than expected. Or smaller. Or just as should be anticipated. That they are occurring is, under the circumstances, only part of the story.</p>

<p>San Antonio Tlayacapan, Mexico -- As a Canadian living in Mexico, I'm disappointed by aspects of the reporting and editing in The Boy At Swine Flu's Ground Zero (front page, April 29).</p>
<p>While the article acknowledges</p>
<p>on an inside page that pigs have</p>
<p>little to do with swine flu, other than the fact that they, birds and humans can contract it, the front-page</p>
<p>presentation belies that.</p>
<p>The five-year-old in question has never been to the pig farm, eight kilometres away. The farm has had no, repeat no, cases of swine flu.</p>
<p>The boy is the only confirmed former case in his village, and he only became sick after 400 or more others contracted some kind of respiratory illness, not swine flu. While these facts are acknowledged, the article also says the boy is thought by some to be case one of this global problem, and the village could be ground zero, because the state's governor told his mommy that. Really? A better headline would have been Rumour And Panic Trump Reason And Proof.</p>
<p>(PC and spin-detector departments, please note: In Israel, “swine flu” is referred to as “Mexico flu”; in Mexico, on the above mentioned pig farm, management calls it “North American flu.” More examples to come, undoubtedly.)</p>
<p>As with SARS, at every stage the media exaggerates the problem. This is dangerous. It produces “the boy who cried wolf” result.</p>
<p>When a real pandemic hits, and it will, people, having learned the dangers are far less than reported, will be much slower to take the necessary precautions.</p>

<p>111That is not entirely a misnomer, since the basic swine flu, of which the new virus appears to be a deadly mutation, may have originated in pigs, just as the avian flu hatched from birds, primarily chickens. As much as we may not like to think it, pigs and people are remarkably similar genetically, sharing more than 90 per cent of genes in common, and both are susceptible to the same flu virus.</p>
<p>Led by an international media in full feeding-frenzy -- CBC's Newsworld is almost entirely devoted these days to the much-anticipated but not yet real pandemic -- there is a kind of mild panic abroad that can only grow with the number of cases.</p>
<p>That number is increasing day by day and country by country. Originating in Mexico, it has spread to the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. The numbers are still small, the deadly cases even smaller, but the threat is real and health officials are preparing for war.</p>
<p>Any battle, every war, however, always has collateral damage and in this war Manitoba's pork producers have become the innocent victims. Scientists agree that one cannot contract swine flu by eating pork. Nevertheless, there has been a drop in pork prices to the producers of $12 to $13 per pig, or about 10 per cent, since the beginning of this week, and Manitoba hog farmers attribute that to the linking of pigs to swine flu in the public mind.</p>
<p>That decline comes amid a more general, almost as irrational depression in pork prices caused by the Country of Origin Labelling bill passed by the U.S. Congress in 2008 that requires meat products to be labelled as to where they came from. American supermarkets found that too onerous, and stopped buying Canadian pork.</p>
<p>That, however, is a political problem that governments can discuss and possibly resolve. It is not a superstition, as is the swine-flu-inspired boycott of pork -- several countries have this week even banned the import of pig products.</p>
<p>Superstition is more difficult, perhaps impossible to counter. It has been suggested that the current deadly flu be called something other than "swine," but its association with pigs is probably inextricably linked in the public mind by now. The only answer to superstition is, as it always has been, education, which is equally difficult to implement and not, right, now, high on any government's priority list.</p>

</p>
<p>What the heck is going on with the blistering pace of big concerts in Winnipeg?</p>
<p>Country superstar Keith Urban's September show at the MTS Centre is expected to be a quick sellout when tickets open to the masses Friday morning.</p>
<p>The incomparable Leonard Cohen brings his brilliant show here tonight, and enduring local dinosaurs Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings have just trumpeted a joint gig for June 30.</p>
<p>AC/DC, Fleetwood Mac and Rod Stewart have recently entered the fray, and an announcement of another major show -- rumoured to be an Aug. 7 visit from Aerosmith and ZZ Top -- at Canad Inns Stadium is expected early next week.</p>
<p>Are touring musicians so dense they don't know there's a recession going on? Have fears of swine flu affected their judgment, if not their bowels?</p>
<p>Apparently Manitoba is rolling in money, according to Kevin Donnelly, the MTS Centre's senior vice-president and general manager.</p>
<p>"The concert business can be divided in two," he says. "Canada and the rest of the planet."</p>
<p>Western Canada, in particular, is going great guns, Donnelly says, while the U.S., predominantly the south and Detroit, is sucking wind.</p>
<p>"At this point, I'm expecting another banner year. I won't say a record, but it will be as strong as we've ever seen."</p>
<p>A top official with the country's main promoter, Vancouver-headquartered <span class="companylink">Live Nation</span> Canada, concurs with Donnelly.</p>
<p>"Business has been great," says Ian Low, a Transcona boy who has risen to become the monolith's executive vice-president for talent in Canada.</p>
<p>"Six of AC/DC's 15 North American stadium shows are in Canada. We sold out all four in the West in less than an hour."</p>
<p>Locally, while some acts have not been sales barnburners (Diana Krall, Cohen, Gordon Lightfoot), Donnelly insists he has not had so many sellouts on the books in one year.</p>
<p>The Eagles and Nickelback recently filled the 15,000-seat Phone Booth. All 41,000 tickets for AC/DC are gone, and Coldplay, the Jonas Brothers, Taylor Swift and Metallica tickets can be found only on the scalpers' website nearest you.</p>
<p>Fleetwood Mac, which went on sale last weekend, will be sold out before the June 6 show date. Keith Urban tickets, too, will be hard to come by (at their retail price) after Friday.</p>
<p>"The shock value of the $100 ticket is absolutely gone," Donnelly notes.</p>
<p>"That lack of resistance helps a lot in keeping up the flow of Triple-A shows."</p>
<p>He points out that the strong business is not limited to rock concerts, or even music shows. The Harlem Globetrotters, a monster truck rally, and WWE wrestling attracted huge crowds. This past winter's <span class="companylink">Disney</span> on Ice show did the best here it's ever done.</p>
<p>And let's not forget the arena's principal tenants, the Moose. Spokesman Scott Brown says the team's playoff games are drawing twice as well as anyone else in the American Hockey League, and this after finishing first in ticket sales for the regular season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, life seems rosy for the establishment arts. Manitoba Opera has essentially sold out its three-show run of Madama Butterfly (which ends Friday at the 2,200-seat Centennial Concert Hall).</p>
<p>And Manitoba Theatre Centre is predicting big crowds for its national headline-earning production of The Boys in the Photograph, which officially opens, opposite Cohen, tonight.</p>
<p>At the 1,600-seat Burton Cummings Theatre, general manager Wayne Jackson reports that the ceaseless activity at the MTS Centre is not sinking his ship.</p>
<p>"We're holding steady with where we've been the last two or three years," says Jackson, whose venue has played host to this week's Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra Indigenous Festival.</p>
<p>"The big road shows are our bread and butter, and if we can do 40 a year, we're fine."</p>
<p>Sunday's concert by the British post-punk band Bloc Party sold out in 10 minutes, he says, and Wednesday's forthcoming concert by Toronto rapper k-os is also expected to do well.</p>
<p>Mind you, k-os seats are technically free, as long as you make a "donation," in exchange for the concert, a T-shirt and a CD.</p>
<p>"That's his way to get around <span class="companylink">Ticketmaster</span> and high ticket prices," Jackson says. "He's saying 'support me if you like my music.'"</p>
<p>As for the perennial burr of online scalping, Donnelly warns, it will not disappear.</p>
<p>"All cynicism and criticism aside, <span class="companylink">Ticketmaster</span> does a remarkable job," he says. "We almost never have to deal with a duplicate ticket."</p>

<p>Another day, another concert announcement Major shows to date in 2009 at the MTS Centre:</p>

<p>Don't worry, people. There's no need for panic. Swine flu has reached the phase 5 alert level, which is bad but not disastrous. Barack Obama is on top of it. He has gone on TV to reassure us we don't need to close the schools yet, just some of them. He's banker-in-chief and car salesman-in-chief, and now he's the public health officer-in-chief. Is there nothing this man can't do?</p>
<p>The good thing about swine flu is that it was time to change the subject. We'd had it with the global financial meltdown. Now we can worry whether this virus will turn into the Big One. Excuse me. Did you just sneeze? Been to Mexico lately?</p>
<p>I confess that the outbreak of deadly swine flu coverage has been boring me to bits. When there are more stories than sick people, you've got to ask what happens if things get worse. Do we really need moment-to-moment updates on the health status of those four students in Nova Scotia? (They're all fine now.)</p>
<p>There is so little real news that, yesterday, the CBC was reduced to filling air time with the tragic story of a young couple from Toronto whose plans to get married in Mexico next week are in ruins. “At least we're safe,” said the shattered bridegroom. “We still have each other.”</p>
<p>One reason for the overload is that the authorities are eager to prove they're on the ball – especially in Canada, where they really bungled it with SARS. Not this time! They're all stampeding toward the nearest microphone to tell us not to panic. Don't even think of going to Mexico, though. The airlines have cancelled all their flights, just to be safe.</p>
<p>In the movies, pandemics are a whole lot more exciting than in real life. They never come from boring places such as Mexico. They come from the jungles of darkest Africa or outer space or from medical experiments gone amok. They generally kill people in a gruesome and colourful way, such as liquefying their organs, and they invariably threaten to destroy Earth. Usually, the human race has done something bad to deserve it.</p>
<p>Do we deserve swine flu? Some people think so. “Dare we ask why this is happening?” said one letter writer in The New York Times. “As the world moves toward raising the majority of animals in the unnatural setting of factory farms, it is likely that more, and worse, such pathogens will arise.” The meat industry, he warned, could be the death of us all.</p>
<p>All pandemics have scapegoats. During SARS, we blamed the Chinese for living too close to chickens. In Thailand, they're calling this “Mexican” flu. In Israel, a deputy health minister said they would, too, so people presumably wouldn't have to say the word “swine.” Meantime, Mexican officials insist that the virus comes from Asia. Other people are pointing fingers at a big American-owned pig farm upwind of the epicentre. As pork sales plummet, pigs are being scapegoated, too; Egypt, for instance, has started slaughtering its pigs as a precaution.</p>
<p>Meantime, some of us are wondering whether it's time to stockpile food again, in case we're quarantined, or whether we should go find some masks and Tamiflu. And now we're told that swine flu – or rather, the fear of swine flu – will make the world economy even worse. “The impact could be absolutely devastating,” one business reporter warned. If we all get scared and stay home, everybody loses.</p>
<p>In fact, swine flu and the global meltdown are a lot alike. They cross all borders. Everybody needs to co-operate to minimize the damage. And if people are running scared, everything will just get worse.</p>
<p>Jared Diamond was right when he said the global village has turned the world into a melting pot of microbes. Germs and toxic assets both spread around the world in an instant. Still, I refuse to panic just quite yet. Remember, in the movies, the microbes eventually lose.</p>
<p>Anyway, please excuse me while I go wash my hands.</p>

<p>Canada's largest pork processor says it is watching reports of the swine flu outbreak closely but that it so far has had little impact on its business.</p>
<p>Maple Leaf Foods Inc. emphasized that consumers cannot contract swine flu from eating pork.</p>
<p>Despite this, some countries have closed their borders to imports of fresh pork, which could have an impact on global demand and prices, the Toronto-based company said.</p>
<p>"There may be some early reaction in international pork markets as it relates to trade flows. It is, as yet, unclear to us ... whether this would be neutral, positive or negative to the Maple Leaf organization. Best to describe it as neutral at this stage," Maple Leaf Foods president and chief executive officer Michael McCain told financial analysts on a conference call yesterday.</p>
<p>The price of pork bellies fell the maximum allowed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for a third straight day yesterday, as Thailand, Honduras, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia and Ukraine joined China, Russia and others in banning imports of some American pork, the U.S. agriculture department said.</p>
<p>Still reeling from last summer's listeriosis outbreak at a Toronto meat packing plant, which claimed 22 lives in Canada, Maple Leaf said it was important to note "swine flu is a public health issue, not a food safety issue.</p>
<p>"The North American flu, or swine flu, is not transmitted through eating pork. There have been no cases of this flu virus reported in pigs, to our knowledge," McCain added.</p>
<p>The Toronto-based company said sales of its sliced meats, which were affected by the listeriosis crisis, have recovered but at the expense of profit margins as it uses coupons and price discounting to regain customers. Maple Leaf said margins would take longer than sales to recover. It gave no fixed target.</p>
<p>The company said it opposes demands in the U.S. for country-of-origin labelling on all livestock, even though the move would not affect its business as it exports meat, not live animals.</p>
<p>"The past year was without a doubt the worst year in our history," McCain told shareholders at its annual general meeting earlier in the day, citing the combination of soaring prices for wheat and oil and the listeriosis outbreak.</p>
<p>In the latest quarter, the company said it made gains despite the economic downturn.</p>
<p>It credited cash-strapped consumers for eating fewer restaurant meals and buying more grocery store basics, such as meat and bread. Maple Leaf owns 89 per cent of Canada Bread, maker of Dempsters.</p>
<p>Maple Leaf Foods earned $2.9 million, or 2 cents a share, reversing a loss of $10,000, or zero cents a share, in the year-earlier period as gains in its fresh pork and bakery business offset losses in its processed and packaged meats division. Sales grew 6.7 per cent to $1.28 billion.</p>
<p>Earnings in its meat division, which includes sliced meats, plunged 54 per cent to $11.5 million, the company said.</p>
<p>Maple Leaf shares rose 14 cents, or 1.66 per cent, to close at $8.59 on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday.</p>

<p>Director of operations resigns post from Rock</p>
<p>In the first of what may be a host of off-season changes, Mike Kloepfer has resigned as director of lacrosse operations for the Toronto Rock.</p>
<p>"It was a challenging three years and I wish the organization all the best in the future," Kloepfer said in a statement yesterday.</p>
<p>In his three seasons in Toronto, the Rock continued a tumble which began after 2005, the last of their five championships in seven years. They compiled a 19-29 record over that span and made the playoffs once, in 2007, when they were eliminated after one game.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'All of humanity is under threat'; WHO raises global alert to second-highest phase, warning a pandemic of swine flu likely imminent</b>
</div><div>Tanya Talaga and Megan Ogilvie   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>652 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>MET</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has raised its global alert level for swine flu to its second-highest phase, saying it believes a pandemic is imminent.</p>
<p>"It really is all of humanity that is under threat during a pandemic," Dr. Margaret Chan, the WHO's director-general, told a news conference in Geneva. "All countries should immediately activate their pandemic preparedness plan."</p>
<p>Countries should remain on "high alert" for signs of the influenza and world leaders, drug companies, businesses and governments must all work together to combat what the future may hold, Chan said.</p>
<p>Asked for advice for ordinary citizens, Chan said: "Continue with your business but try to pay special attention to personal hygiene."</p>
<p>Swine flu is suspected of killing 160 people in Mexico and making about 2,500 ill there. The United States reported the first swine flu death outside of Mexico, a Mexican toddler who had travelled with his family to Texas.</p>
<p>Total American cases surged to nearly 100, spreading to 11 states.</p>
<p>Six more cases were confirmed in Canada yesterday - three in British Columbia and three women in Greater Toronto - bringing the total in the country to 19.</p>
<p>There are seven cases in Ontario, six in B.C., four in Nova Scotia and two in Alberta.</p>
<p>All illnesses in Canada have so far been mild.</p>
<p>The WHO has confirmed cases of swine flu in Britain, Israel, New Zealand and Spain. Germany, Austria and Peru became the latest countries to report infections. Germany reported four cases yesterday, Austria and Peru one each.</p>
<p>"Containment is no longer a feasible option," Dr. Keiji Fukuda, assistant director at the WHO, said after a meeting of the agency's emergency committee in Geneva.</p>
<p>"The world should focus on mitigation. We recommend not closing borders or restricting travel."</p>
<p>While most other countries have not yet seen the swine flu during Phase 5, an alert level this high is a strong signal the pandemic is imminent and that it is time to quickly complete organizational plans on how to handle an outbreak.</p>
<p>Phase 6, the highest phase, indicates a global pandemic is underway and that there are community level outbreaks in one other country in a different world region.</p>
<p>Investigators continue to see an illness that is generally consistent with seasonal influenza, said Fukuda, adding there is "some suggestion perhaps some cases are getting diarrhea more often than normal."</p>
<p>Health officials remain puzzled as to why so many have died in Mexico while the disease has been mild in other parts of North America.</p>
<p>At this point, the epidemic could "suddenly stop for unknown reasons" but that is probably unlikely, Fukuda said.</p>
<p>The raised pandemic alert level does not alter Canadian plans, said Dr. David Butler-Jones, the country's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>"We have a Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan, we've been following it, and we will continue to adapt our surveillance, our infection prevention measures and communicating as our own situation dictates," he said.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said more cases will emerge as officials ramp up surveillance efforts. "As for any form of influenza, some will be more severe and unfortunately we may see some deaths as well," he said.</p>
<p>As fear and uncertainty about the flu ricocheted around the globe, nations took all sorts of precautions, some more useful than others.</p>
<p>Britain closed a school after a 12-year-old girl was found to have the disease. Egypt slaughtered all its pigs and the central African nation of Gabon became the latest to ban pork imports, despite assurances that swine flu was not related to eating pork.</p>

<p>Three new confirmed cases of swine flu have brought the total in Ontario to seven, all young adults living in the Greater Toronto Area, provincial health officials say.</p>
<p>Six had recently travelled to Mexico. One person's travel history was not yet known, Dr. David Williams, acting chief medical officer of health, said yesterday. All had mild swine flu symptoms such as fever, cough and respiratory ailments, and were recovering at home.</p>
<p>Four cases are in Durham Region, two in York and one in Peel. None of the travellers, whose average age is 22, required hospitalization.</p>
<p>"As most lab test results come available we'll see more and more cases," Williams said. "I think the numbers will probably go up before they come down."</p>
<p>Dr. Karim Kurji, York's medical officer of health, said the region's second confirmed case is a 22-year-old woman who travelled to Cabo San Lucas at the bottom of Mexico's west coast. She was treated in a Toronto hospital and sent home with minor symptoms.</p>
<p>New details also emerged about York Region's first case, announced Tuesday. The patient is a 27-year-old Keswick man who was treated in hospital after returning from a vacation at the luxury Riu Caribe hotel in Cancun at the south end of Mexico's east coast.</p>
<p>Possible links between the cases were being investigated, Kurji said.</p>
<p>Peel's associate medical officer of health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, said the region is in daily contact with the province and other health-care stakeholders. She declined to release specifics about its first case, a woman, citing patient privacy.</p>
<p>No details were available about the new case in Durham, also a woman. Three cases in the region - all young women - were announced Tuesday.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canada should avoid the worst, experts believe; Disease exists in far larger numbers than we know, but isn't making people sick enough to see a doctor</b>
</div><div>Joseph Hall   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>576 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>What kind of beast will swine flu prove to be?</p>
<p>Will it gore its way across the globe in a virulent pandemic, or root around a bit here and there - and then just go away?</p>
<p>"All bets are off," says Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious disease prevention and control at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion.</p>
<p>"We're in a really weird period right now where you don't know which way this is going to go."</p>
<p>But interviews with communicable illness experts suggest there may be reasons to wager on the more benign outcome, particularly in advanced countries like Canada.</p>
<p>Gardam said evidence so far suggests the swine flu may have the potential to match a 1957 Asian flu pandemic that killed an estimated 2 million around the world. But it almost certainly won't have the legs of the 1918 Spanish flu, which killed more than 50 million.</p>
<p>By comparison, a typical seasonal flu will claim about half a million lives in a year.</p>
<p>Gardam said the swine flu virus is a new microbe, whose novelty means people would have no built-in immunity to it.</p>
<p>But while he stressed the swine flu's virulence - or illness-inducing potency - is still an unknown, Gardam said there is scientific reason to theorize it may already have become weaker.</p>
<p>"If you have two (flu) strains, one strain which makes people deathly ill and one strain which makes them mildly ill and able to walk around town and spread it to more people, you can imagine very quickly the milder strain tends to predominate," Gardam said.</p>
<p>This selective process is what may have happened in Mexico, he said. "That's one of the many theories floating around about why Mexico is different than anywhere else. The virus may already have mutated and we have some evidence that that is true already ... to become somewhat less virulent."</p>
<p>Second, even in Mexico, where 160 people have died, the flu is almost certainly less virulent than the numbers indicate, Gardam said.</p>
<p>The ratio of those who died in Mexico to those with the disease would make the swine flu virus far more lethal than the catastrophic Spanish flu of 1918, which had a 1 per cent mortality rate.</p>
<p>"What they're talking about in Mexico right now is a mortality rate of 8 per cent."</p>
<p>"Clearly that's a function of them only identifying the sickest people."</p>
<p>Gardam suggested many thousands of people in Mexico must have had a version of the flu that was too mild to register a diagnosis.</p>
<p>Likewise in Canada - and around the world - the disease almost certainly exists in far larger numbers than we know. But it's not making people sick enough to see a doctor.</p>
<p>Regardless of the virus's strength, the most promising news is that it is almost certainly susceptible to antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu, said Dr. Mark Loeb, a McMaster University flu expert.</p>
<p>"We have antivirals ... and in Canada in particular we have an excellent surveillance program in place."</p>

<p>A Canadian woman whose return from Mexico was delayed after she suffered a severe asthma attack died in a Peterborough hospital Tuesday night at the age of 29.</p>
<p>Victoria George-Pazzano was a loving mother, phenomenal wife and valedictorian of her college class, her husband said.</p>
<p>"My wife is a beautiful, vibrant and brilliant young woman and she will always remain that to me," said Dylan Pazzano.</p>
<p>Her husband believes the recent fear over the swine flu in Mexico delayed her trip back.</p>
<p>George-Pazzano worked as a marketing researcher after graduating from Seneca College. Pazzano said his wife was a truly dedicated mother to her 5-year-old son.</p>
<p>"Everything she strived for, and did, was for her son."</p>
<p>George-Pazzano suffered a severe asthma attack early April 22 while vacationing with her son and husband in Cancun. She was transported to hospital where she was put on life support.</p>
<p>In the wake of the swine flu outbreak, Pazzano struggled to find an intensive care bed in Canada for his wife. Their insurance provider quickly offered an air ambulance.</p>
<p>"All I wanted to do from day one was give my wife a chance to say goodbye," he said.</p>
<p>Pazzano said the Mexican hospital was helpful and the individual Canadian public officials he contacted bent over backwards to help return her to Canada. However, the Ontario Ministry of Health never contacted him during the past week nor have they offered condolences.</p>
<p>George-Pazzano was transported to Toronto early Tuesday morning by air ambulance after being in a Mexico hospital for six days on life support. She was then taken to Peterborough Regional Health Centre, where her family and close friends gathered to say goodbye.</p>
<p>George-Pazzano graduated from Seneca with a business administration and marketing diploma in June 2007. "Victoria was an exceptional student both academically and in terms of her extracurricular activities," said Marianne Mirando, who taught her several courses. George-Pazzano was a tutor and a mentor to incoming students, Mirando said.</p>

<p>Canadian stocks rebounded after a twoday slide at the start of the week as positive earnings reports and rising commodity prices buoyed investor confidence.</p>
<p>The S&P/TSX composite index climbed 68.28 points, or 0.73%, yesterday to close at 9416.31. Gainers outpaced losers almost three to one on Canada's main exchange, with six of 10 subindices closing in the positive territory. The TSX venture exchange was also higher, adding 20.87 points, or 2.10%, to 1013.97. The Canadian dollar, meanwhile, climbed to US83.13 cents, up 1.2 cents as the U.S. dollar fell sharply on concerns about rising long-term interest rates in the U.S.</p>
<p>"In general, there was more encouraging news [yesterday] than discouraging news today," said David Baskin, president of Baskin Financial Services in Toronto. In addition to a list of solid earnings on both sides of the border, he thinks people are less concerned about the repercussions of the swine flu on the overall economy, as reports surface downplaying its impact. He added the latest GDP figures, while worse than expected, were not all bad -- noting that consumer spending continues to remain strong. "I think there is a growing consensus that if we are not at the bottom of the economic cycle, we are very close to there because we are seeing a few indicators that are turning from down to flat." The falling greenback also gave a lift to commodity prices, helping resources stocks lead the way higher in Toronto.</p>
<p>The energy group jumped 1.66%, as light sweet crude oil jumped back above US$50 to US$50.97 a barrel, up US$1.05. <span class="companylink">Talisman Energy Inc</span>. climbed after reporting better-than-expected earnings. Materials added 1.40% as a group, as copper prices surged and gold prices advanced to US$900.50 an ounce, up US$6.90. <span class="companylink">Barrick Gold Corp</span>. jumped five cents to $35.65, after saying its first-quarter profit fell 28% on higher costs and weaker copper prices.</p>
<p>Other stocks making significant market moves on earnings releases included <span class="companylink">Rogers Communications Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Maple Leaf Foods Inc</span>. The wireless giant fell 1.18% after reporting profit fell 10% in the first quarter, while Maple Leaf climbed 1.78%, after reporting a return to profit for the first quarter, despite the lingering effects of last summer's tainted-meat recall.</p>
<p>In the U.S., stocks also rose. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 168.78 points, or 2.11%, to 8185.73. The S&P 500 advanced 18.48 points, or 2.16%, to 873.64 and the Nasdaq composite index gained 38.13 points, or 2.28%, to 1711.94.</p>
<p>As many as 20 companies on the S&P 500 reported earnings yesterday that exceeded expectations, according to Bloomberg data.</p>

<p><span class="companylink">Royal Caribbean International</span>'s Mariner of the Seas cruise ship is pulling into Ogden Point for six visits this season -- starting next week -- now that it has been routed away from Mexico because of the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>When the vessel arrives at noon on Wednesday, it will the largest cruise ship ever to arrive in Victoria, Paul Servos, Greater Victoria Harbour Authority CEO, said yesterday.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to accommodate the vessel during its temporary itinerary change," he said. "Everybody is in a tight corner right now."</p>
<p>The ship's presence will boost the already record number of cruise-ship visits at Ogden Point to 220.</p>
<p>Major cruise lines are staying out of Mexican ports because of swine flu. Los Angeles-based Mariner of the Seas was scheduled to stop in the Mexican ports of Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta, but will now visit San Francisco, Seattle and Victoria, Servos said.</p>
<p>In response to the swine flu, the harbour authority is installing new hand-sanitizers on the pier and on ramps connecting with the ships, and beefing up its cleaning.</p>
<p>Mariner of the Seas visits are expected to result in a total of $1.5 million in direct spending in Victoria, with the economic impact multiplying in the economy to an estimated $4.4 million, Servos said.</p>
<p>At 1,020 feet long, the ship will stretch beyond the pier by 216 feet. The vessel might use its anchor to help manoeuvre as it backs into its berth. It has a displacement of 138,000 gross tons, and carries 3,114 passengers and 1,185 crew.</p>
<p>"We are hoping that they will have a wonderful experience and be a regular caller in the future," Servos said.</p>
<p>No additional cruise lines have arranged stops in Victoria at this point.</p>
<p>The vessel is among a new generation of larger vessels now being built by cruise lines, Servos said, which is why the harbour authority is hoping to build a new $4.5-million tie-up dolphin, a device to allow bigger vessels to moor at Ogden Point.</p>
<p>Ogden Point will be extra-busy in the coming days, as the facility greets other vessels as well -- bringing the port back to its origins as a multi-use terminal, Servos said. The harbour authority is aiming to diversify the facility.</p>
<p>"Ogden Point is not just a cruise-ship terminal," he said. "This is a great example of Ogden Point coming back to life."</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Tern, a heavy-load carrier, docked at Ogden Point, carrying the HMCS Chicoutimi submarine, which will go into dry dock at <span class="companylink">Victoria Shipyards</span>.</p>
<p>The cargo ship, Pantanel, will be here until Saturday while 16 yachts are offloaded and another seven loaded. On Sunday, <span class="companylink">Crystal Cruise</span> Lines' Serenity arrives for its first visit to Victoria.</p>
<p>"All this activity at Ogden Point is great news for the Greater Victoria region," Servos said. "The port infrastructure is a significant contributor to the economic well-being of the whole community."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Researchers theorize about why cases less severe outside Mexico</b>
</div><div>Andrew Mayeda   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>492 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Early</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>As they continue to analyze the new swine-flu virus, researchers are grappling with a puzzling question: Why are the Canadian and the U.S. cases generally milder than those in Mexico?</p>
<p>It's not just an interesting question for scientists to ponder. Over the coming days and weeks, public-health officials will be watching like hawks to see if the milder cases are a sign the outbreak is dissipating, or whether such cases are just the prelude to a full-blown pandemic.</p>
<p>Infectious-disease experts note the Spanish flu pandemic started out mildly in the spring of 1918 before re-emerging with a vengeance in the fall.</p>
<p>"We cannot be complacent, because this particular influenza strain, just like any other virus or flu strain, can still continue to mutate and it can mutate in either direction," said Dr. Colin Lee, associate medical officer of health at the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit in Ontario.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, there had been up to 176 suspected deaths in Mexico. A toddler from Mexico City died Monday in Texas from the flu, the first fatality outside Mexico.</p>
<p>To date, most of the cases in countries other than Mexico have been relatively mild.</p>
<p>That's true of all 19 confirmed cases in Canada and six in B.C., including one in Victoria.</p>
<p>Several theories are emerging to explain the discrepancy.</p>
<p>One is purely statistical.</p>
<p>In any flu outbreak, there will be a large number of mild cases and a much smaller number of severe, or even fatal, cases. Given that Mexico is the epicentre of the outbreak, it makes sense more deaths would have been confirmed there so far, noted Dr. Gerald Evans, chief of the infectious-diseases division at Queen's University.</p>
<p>Experts also say the virus could have mutated, becoming milder as it migrates to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>It's also possible the strain found in places such as Canada and the United States is at an earlier stage of mutation than the original strain in Mexico, which would suggest Canada and the U.S. are in store for much more serious cases.</p>
<p>"The question really is, 'Are we looking at the earlier stage of the disease, which means the strain we are seeing now [in Canada] is just an earlier version of the Mexican strain?' " said Bhagirath Singh, scientific director of the CIHR Institute of Infection and Immunity at the University of Western Ontario.</p>
<p>There is also the possibility something in the genetic makeup of Mexicans is making them more susceptible, although some experts dismiss the hypothesis.</p>
<p>"We do not differ genetically that much from our Mexican brothers and sisters as some people might speculate, and genes very rarely have anything to do with the expression of infectious diseases," Evans said.</p>

<p>Australia has not issued an alert to its citizens to restrict travel to countries where cases of swine flu have been confirmed, including Canada. Erroneous information was contained in a Canwest News story on page A1 of Tuesday's Times Colonist.</p>

</p>
<p>As Canada's swine flu infection total reached 19 yesterday, including six cases in B.C., the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level to its second-highest phase and urged nations to "ramp up" their preparations.</p>
<p>B.C. and Ontario each added three confirmed cases to their tallies yesterday, all mild. The other Canadian cases are in Alberta and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The three new B.C. cases are in Metro Vancouver. The only confirmed case on Vancouver Island is that of Michelle Bossi, 30, who is recovering at home.</p>
<p>Five of B.C.'s six cases involve travellers who, like Bossi, recently returned from Mexico. The sixth person had contact with one of those travellers but has not been to Mexico recently.</p>
<p>More than 30 samples have been taken from Island residents and are being tested at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, said Dr. Richard Stanwick, Vancouver Island Health Authority chief medical health officer. It is expected that the number of samples taken will jump as Island hospitals are now on heightened influenza alert and staff will be looking for signs of anyone in respiratory distress.</p>
<p>Dr. David Patrick of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control said the fact that B.C. now has its first case of transmission within the province indicates the flu is going to spread and linger. The good news is that while some of the afflicted went to hospital for brief intravenous and other medical attention, only one of the three new cases required an overnight hospital stay in an undisclosed location.</p>
<p>By raising the level from four to five, the WHO is indicating a pandemic is likely imminent and that countries should take certain actions with an increased sense of urgency in order to prepare.</p>
<p>"All countries should immediately now activate their pandemic preparedness plans," WHO director general Margaret Chan said in Geneva.</p>
<p>According to WHO's guidelines, a phase five is reached when there is human-to-human spread of the virus in at least two countries. On Monday, WHO raised the level from three to four, which meant a pandemic was possible but not inevitable.</p>
<p>The global spread of the virus, which originated in Mexico and is suspected of making more than 2,000 people there sick, has moved quickly since then.</p>
<p>Mexican officials said yesterday that up to 176 people have been killed by the flu, but many of those cases may never be confirmed, as the victims have been buried.</p>
<p>American authorities reported the first death due to the flu outside Mexico yesterday. A toddler from Mexico City, who was visiting relatives in Texas, became sick and died Monday, officials said.</p>

<p>With the swine flu epidemic in Mexico sending Canadian Tour golfers north, the next event on the schedule will be the spring qualifying school at Morningstar in Parksville the last week of May.</p>
<p>The decision was made to postpone this week's San Luis Potosi Open, which follows postponement of tournaments the two succeeding weeks. The Canadian Tour hopes to tack on these three $125,000 US events following the Tour Championship in September.</p>
<p>The first back in Canada were Doug Stone of Stone Television and producer/writer Eric Dwyer, who were filming the Canadian Tour show on the Golf Channel.</p>
<p>"The players had to bus back to Mexico City so the Tour could get everyone home from there," said Stone.</p>
<p>The good news -- if there is such a thing at a time like this -- is that the Times Colonist Open the first week of June at Uplands will be worth $50,000 more than it was last year. The purse is $200,000. The City of Surrey tournament at Hazelmere the following week will increase to $150,000.</p>
<p>- Langley junior Darren Wallace, who hadn't made much noise since becoming the youngest player to win the Canadian Amateur in 2004, pushed himself back to the fore by winning the Pac-10 individual title and pacing Washington Huskies to the team title. He beat teammate Nick Taylor for the individual title. Wallace finished at 11-under 277. Taylor, who won the Canadian Amateur in '07, was four shots back.</p>
<p>The Huskies finished at 16 under -- 18 shots ahead of the Oregon Ducks. Eugene Wong of North Vancouver was at even par for the Ducks.</p>

<p>TORONTO -- Air travel tightened to Mexico, the country at the centre of the swine-flu outbreak, as Air Canada, <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">Transat A.T. Inc</span>. joined Europe's two largest tour operators in suspending flights.</p>
<p>Air Canada, Canada's biggest airline, said it would suspend flights to Cancun, Cozumel and Puerto Vallarta until June 1. The Montreal-based carrier plans to keep flights to Mexico City.</p>
<p>WestJet, the second-biggest carrier, will suspend flights to Cancun, Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta starting May 4. Flights will resume to all the cities except Cancun on June 20, the Calgary-based airline said. Cancun service is seasonal and will resume in the fall.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, we have made this decision for the safety and well-being of our guests," WestJet CEO Sean Durfy said.</p>
<p>Transat's flights from Canada to Mexico are scrubbed through June 1 and from France to Mexico through May 31. Planned flights from Mexico will continue to May 3, and trips will be added to bring home customers and employees, the Montreal-based company said.</p>
<p>Transat has about 5,000 customers and 20 employees in Mexico, spokesman Jean-Michel Laberge, said. Mexico flights fell to 30 this week from 45 as the peak travel season ended, and will decline to 18 next week, Laberge said.</p>
<p>Argentina halted direct flights from Mexico City until May 4, and Cuba said all air service with Mexico would be suspended for 48 hours "except in exceptional cases," according to a statement on government-run media websites.</p>
<p>The moves may herald similar steps at more airlines as business and leisure fliers adjust plans. While U.S. carriers such as <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines Inc</span>. haven't scrubbed flights, some extended the grace period for passengers to change Mexico trips without penalties.</p>
<p>"I don't think anyone was expecting no cancellations," said Matthew Jacob, an analyst at Majestic Research in New York. "This has been very much in the news, and there is going to be some impact."</p>
<p>Officials in Mexico City ordered all 35,000 restaurants shut to help slow the spread of the influenza strain blamed for 159 deaths in Mexico.</p>
<p>The first death in the U.S. was confirmed yesterday, two days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged travelers to skip nonessential trips to Mexico.</p>

<p>Every year there is a flu pandemic and every year there are outbreaks of other diseases which can lead to mass hysteria.</p>
<p>Swine flu is also a curable flu strain. Millions of people die every year in Third World countries from curable illnesses.</p>
<p>Remember a few years back when there was a hepatitis scare after one or two consumers contracted the disease from a local supermarket? A few people out of the millions living in the Lower Mainland contracted hepatitis. Still, hysteria was created.</p>
<p>In Toronto a handful of people contracted SARS and everyone who had a common head cold thought they were dying,</p>
<p>The predominant area of this new swine flu is Mexico, which has some absolutely filthy areas. Swine flu can be deadly in</p>
<p>Mexico City, which already suffers from a thick fog of pollution and has a massive amount of people who already suffer from immune and respiratory illnesses.</p>
<p>This current pandemic isn't a Stephen King novel where everyone in the world will die within four hours. Natural disasters like, tsunamis, earthquakes, landslides, floods, and hurricanes kill way more people every year than any flu in North America.</p>
<p>If you really want to prepare for something, go buy earthquake insurance and bottled water.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu being transmitted in B.C.; Victim had 'extensive contact' with overseas travellers</b>
</div><div>Kent Spencer   </div>
<div>The Province; with News Services files</div>
<div>630 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>For the first time, a B.C. resident has come down with the swine flu without having travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>The infected B.C. resident "had extensive contact with travellers," said Dr. David Patrick, director of epidemiology services with the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>"It's a newly reported case. We will know more of the details soon," he said.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has raised its alert level from four to five. A level-six alert -- the highest -- means the virus is in full pandemic mode, spreading worldwide.</p>
<p>By raising the level from four to five, the WHO is indicating a pandemic is likely imminent.</p>
<p>"All countries should immediately activate their pandemic-preparedness plans," WHO Director-General Margaret Chan told reporters yesterday in Geneva.</p>
<p>She added that the world "is better prepared for an influenza pandemic than at any time in history."</p>
<p>The WHO's guidelines say a level five is reached when there is human-to-human spread of the virus in at least two countries.</p>
<p>Patrick said B.C. clinicians expected some human-to-human transmissions from people who have not travelled to Mexico, where the virus was first discovered.</p>
<p>"Secondary transmission will certainly occur. [But] if they don't occur very efficiently, this virus is going nowhere in the long run," he said.</p>
<p>Spain yesterday reported the first case in Europe of swine flu in a person who had not been to Mexico.</p>
<p>Germany, Austria and Peru reported cases of the illness, bringing the number of affected countries to 10.</p>
<p>Texas officials said a 22-month-old boy had died -- the first confirmed U.S. swine-flu death -- while on a family visit from Mexico.</p>
<p>Almost all cases outside Mexico have had mild symptoms, and only a handful have required hospitalization. But in Mexico, up to 159 people have died from the virus and more than 2,000 are being tested for infection.</p>
<p>Three new cases of swine flu have been identified in B.C., bringing the total to six. All the new outbreaks are in Metro Vancouver.</p>
<p>"Everybody is expected to recover," Patrick said. None is currently in hospital. Five of the six are younger people who have spent two to seven days in Mexico, mostly in the Cancun area.</p>
<p>Patrick said the province was prepared with 700,000 doses of the anti-viral medication Tamiflu.</p>
<p>He urged people not to stock up on the medicine because he said hospitals have ample supplies.</p>
<p>"If people need it, it will be available," he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Premier Gordon Campbell said there is no cause for public alarm.</p>
<p>"People should be diligent. People are right to be concerned, but there is no cause for undue alarm," Campbell said at a campaign stop in Kelowna. 'If we need to take further steps, we'll take them."</p>
<p>- The 39-year-old woman who was the first Mexican fatality of swine flu spent the last eight days of her life going from clinic to clinic to find out what was wrong with her, but doctors were baffled.</p>
<p>The woman died soon after being admitted to hospital April 12 as an emergency case. Experts only identified the virus 10 days later.</p>
<p>A census-taker in the southern city of Oaxaca, she became ill April 4 with what she thought was a severe case of pneumonia.</p>
<p>"She went to several private clinics, where she was given various diagnoses and various treatments. However, her condition worsened and she was taken to the hospital by emergency services on the 12th, and the next day she died," said Mexico's chief epidemiologist.</p>

</p>
<p>The Mexican flu has put a real bug into a B.C. couple's wedding plans next month.</p>
<p>Mike Goorevitch and Nicole Smith of Victoria had a dream wedding arranged for May 15 on the beautiful shores of the Mayan Riviera.</p>
<p>A beach wedding. Dinner. Mariachis. Dancing. Free massages and a champagne breakfast.</p>
<p>"It was Nicole's dream to have a destination wedding. I wanted to give it to her. It's the biggest day of her life," Goorevitch said yesterday.</p>
<p>They invited 17 friends, who prepaid $28,000 to Sunwing Vacations.</p>
<p>Goorevitch's problems began on Tuesday, when Sunwing flights to Mexico were cancelled after an outbreak of swine flu, which is believed to have caused more than 150 deaths in that country.</p>
<p>The Canadian government has issued an advisory warning travellers to stay away from Mexico.</p>
<p>Goorevitch doesn't blame the airlines for cancelling flights, in view of the health risks.</p>
<p>"We are as concerned about the flu as anybody else," he said.</p>
<p>But he said Sunwing will not issue a full refund so alternative arrangements can be made.</p>
<p>Sunwing representatives said they couldn't comment until learning full details of the couple's arrangements.</p>
<p>The company has offered to rebook flights until Oct. 31 to other destinations, including Cuba and Las Vegas.</p>
<p>A trip to the Dominican Republic was also offered, but Goorevitch said it poses problems because the originating flight leaves from Toronto.</p>
<p>Most wedding guests are from Western Canada and would need to pay an additional $8,000 for connecting flights on short notice.</p>
<p>Another problem is a legal marriage couldn't be arranged at short notice in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>"We're stuck. For all intents and purposes, our wedding has been cancelled by Sunwing. It's ridiculous they're holding us hostage," said Goorevitch.</p>
<p>"Sunwing should be giving everybody their money back in this situation."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>DeLaet pulls plug on Mexico</b>
</div><div>Murray Mccormick   </div>

</p>
<p>A decision by Weyburn's Graham DeLaet to leave Mexico on Sunday is being validated hourly.</p>
<p>DeLaet was scheduled to take part in the San Luis Potosi Open, the second of four Canadian Tour golf tournaments scheduled for Mexico, but left Sunday before the swine flu outbreak became so extreme. DeLaet, Edmonton's Barrett Jarosch and Calgary's James Love travel together on the professional golf tour, which has events in Canada, the United States and Mexico. The trio departed after Love's parents encouraged the golfers to return to their homes.</p>
<p>"(Love's) father said that the World Health Organization was going to release something on the swine flu and he was pretty adamant about James leaving,'' DeLaet said Wednesday from his home in Boise, Idaho. "He said that we could make up our own minds but it was a pretty serious thing and that James should leave soon. We decided it was in our best interest to get out of there because our health is much more important than playing in a couple of golf tournaments.''</p>
<p>The decision to leave received additional validation Wednesday when the Canadian Tour postponed the San Luis Potosi Open. On Tuesday, it had rescheduled the Yucatan Country Club Classic and the Iberostar Riviera Maya Open until later in the 2009 schedule.</p>
<p>The Canadian Tour said it postponed the San Luis Potosi Open because the WHO was expected to elevate the swine flu outbreak to Level 5 (which it did on Wednesday), which means a pandemic is imminent. The Canadian Tour is working to evacuate its staff and members from Mexico.</p>
<p>"I've talked to some of my other buddies down there and they are pretty frantic about getting flights out of San Luis Potosi,'' said DeLaet. "It's pretty hard because it's such a small airport and only a few flights leave there every day. It's good thing we're out of there and I'm really glad that we left when we did.''</p>
<p>DeLaet, 27, said he feels fine and isn't exhibiting any symptoms of swine flu.</p>
<p>"When I came home people were kind of staying away from me but I'm 100 per cent,'' DeLaet said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>He has been following the swine flu developments on CNN and realizes how serious the outbreak has become.</p>
<p>"I had to take a mess of flights home because I got out of there so fast,'' said DeLaet. "I didn't get into Boise until 11 p.m., and on Monday I was pretty much glued to CNN. It was one of those things that no one really knew how bad it would get. We could have stayed longer but it ended up being the right decision to leave when we did.''</p>
<p>The decision to return also had some financial ramifications because DeLaet had already booked charter flights to the other Mexican stops on the Canadian Tour.</p>
<p>"I didn't get a refund on that but luckily I've made a little bit of money over the last few months,'' said DeLaet. "I could afford to book my flights and get out of there.''</p>

</p>
<p>Hog producers say the H1N1 influenza virus dubbed swine flu is a blow to an industry still reeling from recent challenges.</p>
<p>"It's really unfortunate," said Florian Possberg, founder of Saskatchewan's <span class="companylink">Big Sky Farms</span> and chair of the Canadian Swine Health Board.</p>
<p>"We are getting the fallout from this thing and it's really nothing to do with swine," said Possberg, who watched hog futures drop early this week on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.</p>
<p>"Our industry went through some really bad times that really started in September of 2007 when our Canadian dollar went bonkers on us and our industry has not recovered from that."</p>
<p>Hog and animal health groups say part of the current problem is the "swine flu" name given to the virus being passed from human to human. Saskatchewan hadn't recorded any confirmed cases as of Wednesday.</p>
<p>The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) notes the virus includes genetic components of swine, human and avian origin. It's not yet known whether this strain circulating in humans is capable of infecting animals such as hogs, the OIE said.</p>
<p>However, even as health officials also say the virus doesn't appear to be spreading from pigs to humans, Egypt has ordered a cull of all pigs in that country.</p>
<p>Ottawa tried to reassure pork producers Wednesday, reminding Canadians that "Canadian pork is safe."</p>
<p>"We want to reassure Canadians that human swine influenza cannot be contracted through eating pork or pork products," said a news release from International Trade Minister Stockwell Day and Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan Agriculture's provincial veterinarian, Greg Douglas acknowledged that the "swine flu" name isn't very specific.</p>
<p>"There are lots of swine influenza viruses that producers and the industry vaccinate for and they cause little or minimal disease -- it's mostly a production limiting disease -- in swine," Douglas said, also noting influenza viruses are not a food safety concern.</p>
<p>There haven't been any cases of the H1N1 virus being found in humans in North American swine, he said, and producers are being encouraged to heighten their biosecurity measures to ensure the swine herd isn't exposed to the virus. Those measures include restricting who has access to the animals.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan health officials meanwhile continue to keep tabs on possible cases of the human swine flu, reporting the province had no confirmed cases as of mid-morning Wednesday.</p>
<p>Chief medical health officer Dr. Moira McKinnon said 14 people were under "preliminary" investigation because they fell within the definition of a possible swine flu case, but she expects tests are more likely to indicate the common cold or a seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>"Maybe one will eventually, over the next few days, be positive," McKinnon said.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization on Wednesday increased its pandemic alert level from four to five, but Saskatchewan officials said the province had already been preparing for the higher alert level as a precaution.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu: not our biggest worry</b>
</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>569 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>The emergence of a new strain of swine flu brings with it many dangers -- and most of them have nothing to do with the medical effects of the virus itself.</p>
<p>One of the most dangerous things governments can do is miscalculate the relative importance of health risks, thus skewing funding and attention. Every year, there are about nine million new cases of tuberculosis, 247 million cases of malaria, and nearly three million new HIV infections.</p>
<p>Even in the very unlikely event that this new virus does cause a global influenza epidemic like the one in 1918, that would not make it any worse than the existing global epidemics of preventable, communicable diseases that seldom make the headlines and never draw enough funding.</p>
<p>Of course, it is nonetheless in everyone's interest to make sure that swine flu doesn't cause a pandemic. But hasty overreactions aren't the way to do that. A vaccine against a version of swine flu in the 1970s ended up killing more people than the virus did. Every preventive measure can have unintended consequences. If Canadians were to start running to the emergency room every time they got the sniffles, the health-care system would be unable to function properly.</p>
<p>If other countries slap travel advisories on Canada because a few cases have turned up here, or if international trade slows because of unnecessary barriers at the borders, the consequences to the economy could be severe, even if swine flu itself turns out to be a mere blip on the radar of the epidemiologists.</p>
<p>Every country has a tendency to look inward when a crisis threatens, but governments must fight that tendency. Influenza is a global threat, and can only be prevented through co-ordinated international action. We learned this, if we didn't know it before, from the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003, and from avian flu.</p>
<p>As the world comes to grips with the threat of swine flu, it's crucial that governments around the world be forthcoming with complete and accurate information. China, that means you.</p>
<p>If the virus is allowed to take hold anywhere in the world, the risks to people everywhere will be higher. Canada has already helped Mexico assess its situation by testing samples sent to a Canadian lab.</p>
<p>We can do more: Canada can send drugs, lab equipment and facemasks so that frontline clinics in Mexico can diagnose, treat and prevent swine flu.</p>
<p>Within Canada, good communication is key. It will be a lot easier for Canadians to deal with changes to rules in hospitals and other public places if those rules are consistent, logical and well explained.</p>
<p>Fear is a funny thing. Reason tells us that swine flu is, so far, no reason to worry. But it's new, and incompletely understood, and it seems to attack the young and healthy. That makes it scary.</p>
<p>Good policy, though, is based on evidence, not fear. Canada must do its part to deal with this new threat, without allowing it to distract attention from more pressing international crises. The global economy is still in dire straits. The climate is still warming. Genocides rage. Refugees are running for their lives. The diseases of poverty are killing children.</p>
<p>For anyone inclined to worry, there is no shortage of reasons.</p>

</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>

<p>As Canada's swine flu infection total reached 19 Wednesday, the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level to its second highest phase and urged nations to "ramp up" their preparations for a possible pandemic.</p>
<p>By raising the level from four to five WHO is indicating a pandemic is likely imminent and countries should take certain actions with an increased sense of urgency in order to get ready for it.</p>
<p>"All countries should immediately now activate their pandemic preparedness plans," WHO Director General Margaret Chan said at a news conference in Geneva.</p>
<p>According to WHO's guidelines, a phase five is reached when there is human-to-human spread of the virus in at least two countries. On Monday, WHO raised the level from three to four, which meant a pandemic was possible but not inevitable.</p>
<p>The global spread of the virus, which originated in Mexico and is suspected of making more than 2,000 people there sick, has moved quickly since then.</p>
<p>"This change to a higher phase of alert is a signal to governments ... to the pharmaceutical industry and the business community, that certain actions now should be undertaken with increased urgency and an accelerated pace," said Chan.</p>
<p>She made her decision after consultations with experts studying the swine virus that has infected more than 140 people in at least seven countries, and earlier Wednesday claimed its first fatality outside of Mexico.</p>
<p>The illness is believed to have killed more than 150 people in Mexico.</p>
<p>The victim in the United States was a toddler, a Mexican citizen who was visiting Texas, who died in hospital after quickly falling ill.</p>
<p>Canadian health officials said WHO raising the alert doesn't fundamentally change Ottawa's course of action in responding to the swine flu outbreak, which has infected Canadians in four different provinces.</p>
<p>British Columbia and Ontario each added three confirmed cases to their tallies Wednesday, all mild. The other cases are in Alberta and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>"Regardless of (at) what level the World Health Organization decides to set its alert, I want to reassure Canadians that our government is prepared to deal with this situation head on," Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said at a daily news briefing.</p>
<p>Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones added Canada is already operating at an escalated alert level because of the cases that have been confirmed here.</p>
<p>The first ones were confirmed on Sunday.</p>
<p>"If this continues and WHO goes to level six, basically for us, we're functioning in that way now," he said. "Whether it's four or five or six, that's just a number. It's our planning, preparation and response that really count."</p>
<p>Canada's pandemic influenza plan, developed in 2006, contains a range of measures that could be implemented in the event a pandemic arrives. They could include widespread immunization, closing schools or other public places, and isolating infected people.</p>
<p>Many of the measures, however, would be up to local health authorities and provincial governments to implement.</p>
<p>Certain events, such as the spread of clusters of the disease from one community to another, and deaths, would trigger further actions.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones did not recommend Canadians start wearing protective masks, saying they could provide "false reassurance."</p>
<p>There are still many unanswered questions about the new H1N1 virus that is composed of a mixture of swine, avian and human viruses, in a combination that has never been seen before.</p>
<p>Health officials, for example, don't know where in Mexico it originated, why it has proven more deadly there than anywhere else, and why it seems to be striking young and otherwise healthy people. WHO's chief promised to get to the bottom of those mysteries and she praised the leadership being provided by Canadian and American laboratories in the hunt for answers.</p>
<p>Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg has played a key role in the swine flu outbreak and is responsible for testing hundreds of samples of suspected cases from across Canada, and from Mexico which has nowhere near the capacity to do all of its own testing.</p>
<p>"No matter what the situation is, the international community should treat this as a window of opportunity to ramp up preparedness and response," WHO's chief told reporters. "Above all, this is an opportunity for global solidarity as we look for responses and solutions that benefit all countries."</p>

</p>
<p>A group of international students are keeping in close contact with family in Mexico City as they monitor the latest developments in the swine flu outbreak in that city and worldwide.</p>
<p>Mariana Felix, a third-year University of Regina kinesiology student, is worried about her family and her friends who live in the epicentre of the outbreak. The H1N1 influenza virus is suspected of being responsible for making around 2,000 people sick in Mexico and killing more than 150, but those cases haven't yet been confirmed by laboratories.</p>
<p>"All my family lives in Mexico City, like my grandma and my cousins. Right now my dad and my older brother are the only ones there because my mom came to visit us (Mariana and another brother at the U of R) two weeks ago,'' Felix said.</p>
<p>"My mom was getting ready to go home this weekend, but my dad said it is going to be hard because a lot of people are trying to get out of the country right now and a lot of people are going back to Mexico.''</p>
<p>Felix said her father advised her mother to stay in Canada for another week because of the high risk of exposure to someone infected with the virus while at the airport or on her flight back to Mexico.</p>
<p>They are hoping things will have stabilized by next week. But on Wednesday, the World Health Organization increased its pandemic alert level to five (out of a six-phase scale) in response to the latest development which saw more confirmed cases of swine flu worldwide, including 16 in Canada, and the first confirmed death in the U.S.</p>
<p>Felix and her friend Arturo Segura, 21, a second-year U of R French major whose family lives in Pachuca about 45 minutes outside Mexico City, have been phoning and e-mailing family and friends for regular updates.</p>
<p>"My mother is really worried because no one is going outside. There are no classes because the schools are closed until May 6 and all the public services, like the movie theatres, the bars and restaurants, are closed,'' Segura said.</p>
<p>"People are terrified because a lot of people have died. There is no cure yet and that is why people are worried and don't want to leave their homes.''</p>
<p>Felix added her father told her the streets are empty and Mexico City is very quiet with people not even venturing out to buy groceries.</p>
<p>"In Mexico City, it is very common to phone the supermarket and order your groceries and they will deliver them to your house. Phone lines are very busy right now because people don't want to go out even to the grocery stores,'' she said, adding her father went to a 24-hour supermarket at midnight one night only to discover the shelves were almost empty.</p>
<p>"People are assuming that it is going to be a long time before they are not going to be able to go out and they want to be prepared. So they are ordering as much food as they can.''</p>
<p>Segura said his father, who is a cardiologist, told him the hospitals are being overrun by people worried they have the swine flu, who are showing up without advance warning, putting hospital staff at risk.</p>
<p>While their family and friends are doing OK, Felix and Segura said they worry the situation could get much worse.</p>

</div><div>Duncan Mavin   </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>720 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>At the Metropark Hotel on the quieter end of Kowloon's Waterloo Road, there was no sign Wednesday that this hotel had been ground zero for the last major threat of a global pandemic prior to the current swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Milling around in the lobby, a handful of tourists and business types seemed oblivious to the hotel's past. There was no hand sanitizer on display, and there was no box of surgical masks for guests.</p>
<p>When the hotel's public relations department was offered the chance to state what they have done to combat another health crisis, they declined to comment.</p>
<p>Yet it is just six years since Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, was traced eventually to a sneezing guest from the mainland in the elevator at the Metropark -- or Metropole as it was called before management gave it a new name.</p>
<p>That sneeze sent SARS around the world, left Hong Kong's tourist industry in tatters, and battered the city's economy too.</p>
<p>In spring of 2003, hotels like the Metropole and restaurants throughout Hong Kong that were usually filled with the conference goers, bankers and traders that the city thrives on were emptied for months. Property prices that had barely recovered from the Asian Financial Crisis of a few years earlier plunged to new lows.</p>
<p>The benchmark index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost almost a fifth of its value in less than five months.</p>
<p>There was even -- and this is a sign of how bad things got -- a drop in shopping, with retails sales down by 15% and malls eerily quiet.</p>
<p>People here still talk of 2003 and SARS as a historic moment, and they judge the impact of other events -- like the current financial crisis -- by comparison to SARS, saying restaurants are still relatively full or house prices have not declined the way they did in 2003.</p>
<p>Although it appears the threat of another major healthscare is having little impact on operations at the Metropark, the city's authorities insist they are not taking swine flu lightly, and insist they are better prepared this time around.</p>
<p>"We are making preparation for the worst scenario, although we hope that it will not happen," said secretary for food and health, Dr. York Chow.</p>
<p>Should a case of swine flu be confirmed in Hong Kong -- none has been so far -- there are plans in place to shut down schools and use holiday camps to quarantine patients. The government has already issued instructions on how to best avoid the illness -- sample: "Cover nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and mouth discharges properly." And the ministry of labour has ordered that sick workers should be told to stay at home.</p>
<p>There are certain measures still in place from the SARS outbreak that will help too -- a ban on spitting, and thermal screening at the city's Chep Lap Kok airport, for instance.</p>
<p>Some in the private sector have pre-empted a repeat of SARS too. Office workers at some big corporations turned in today to find surgical masks were being made available to anyone who'd take one. In some apartment buildings, clear plastic sheeting that is sanitized regularly has been taped over the buttons in the elevator.</p>
<p>It is not surprising the city's officials are acting quickly. Hong Kong's economy is particularly vulnerable, because it is so dependent on trade and travel.</p>
<p>"Hong Kong is such widely travelled international city, it is our responsibility to ensure that we should minimize the impact of this possible pandemic," Mr. Chow said.</p>
<p>The local economy shrank 2.6% as a result of SARS -- it was down by about 9% during the darkest days of the crisis -- and in the aftermath, Hong Kong's rolled out an array of costly measures to boost the economy, including tax cuts and loan guarantees.</p>
<p>The worst hit sector was tourism -- the number of visitors to Hong Kong plunged 70% according to some estimates.</p>
<p>Owners of hotels like the Metropark will be hoping to avoid a repeat.</p>

<p>The illness being called the swine flu could have a devastating impact on western Canadian hog producers, who are already struggling with difficult trade and market conditions, longtime industry authority Florian Possberg said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Some of the pork marketers that process hogs in Canada are saying the demand from foreign buyers like Asia, Russia and Australia has gone quiet in the last couple of days," said Possberg, a former producer and founder of <span class="companylink">Big Sky Farms</span>. He is now a director of the Canada Pork Council and chair of the Canadian Swine Health Board.</p>
<p>"Our industry really relies on exports. About two-thirds of what we produce depends on exports. If it doesn't bounce back soon it will be devastating for our industry," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>"People have choices. They don't have to eat pork and they don't have to buy their pork from Canada."</p>
<p>Possberg said the term swine flu is misleading. There is no proof pigs are the underlying cause, but the moniker could have a similar effect to mad cow disease on the beef industry earlier in the decade. People respond with panic to terms connecting illness with animals.</p>
<p>"To characterize this as the swine flu is really, really unfortunate for us," said Possberg.</p>
<p>The hog industry in Western Canada is in a dramatically weakened state already, said Possberg. Trade issues, high grain prices, the Canadian dollar's rise last year and low hog prices have contributed to a bad two years for pork producers.</p>
<p>"We've lost nearly 30 per cent of our industry in the last two years. . . We were about breaking even now and we were expecting prices to get better as the barbecue season kicks in. We were looking forward to making money after a really devastating time.</p>
<p>"This is just another devastating bit of bad luck we're having to face."</p>
<p>Alan Day, commodity futures broker for Union Securities in Saskatoon, said pork futures improved slightly in Wednesday morning trading by two-tenths of a cent to 62.42 US cents per pound.</p>
<p>"We've had some improvement over the winter," said Day, noting the price was 51.8 US cents per pound in early January.</p>
<p>Still, prices are just in the break-even range for most hog producers, although that varies from barn to barn, said Day.</p>
<p>The United States is the largest customer for Canadian hog producers, which has become a problem as country of origin labelling laws, or COOL, have been instigated.</p>
<p>"That's why this COOL thing is really devastating to us because it's threatening a third of our live business and also our (processed) pork business to the U.S., which is about 20 per cent of our business on the pork side," said Possberg.</p>
<p>Trade Minister Stockwell Day said Tuesday Canada will challenge COOL under World Trade Organization rules. COOL has resulted in curtailed buying of Canadian pigs by major U.S. pork producers. COOL is an issue for U.S. pork producers, because they must track all foreign sources of food and detail them on labels, a process that is expensive and time-consuming. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said just implementing COOL could cost the U.S. meat industry $582 million to $3.8 billion.</p>

<p>Saskatchewan had not recorded a confirmed case of the H1N1 influenza virus -- dubbed swine flu -- as of Wednesday.</p>
<p>Chief medical health officer Dr. Moira McKinnon said 14 people were under "preliminary" investigation because they fell within the definition of a possible swine flu case, but she expects tests are more likely to indicate the common cold or a seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>"Maybe one will eventually, over the next few days, be positive," McKinnon said.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization on Wednesday increased its pandemic alert level from four to five, but Saskatchewan officials said the province had already been preparing for the higher alert level as a precaution.</p>

<p>Saskatchewan-groomed golfer Graham DeLaet is back in Boise, Idaho, after leaving swine flu-ravaged Mexico.</p>
<p>As it turns out, DeLaet is ahead of the game. He left the Canadian Tour days before three Tour tournaments were cancelled in Mexico.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Canadian Tour pulled the plug on this week's San Luis Potosi Open and was working diligently with its travel partners to bring its members and officials home as soon as possible.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the Canadian Tour postponed the final two events of the Mexican swing. Both the Yucatan Country Club Classic and the Iberostar Riviera Maya Open are being re-scheduled for a later date.</p>
<p>"I just wanted to be safe," DeLaet said Wednesday when reached by phone in Boise.</p>
<p>"I just wanted to err on the side of caution. As it turns out, it was a good decision."</p>
<p>The World Health Organization says the swine flu outbreak is moving closer to becoming a pandemic.</p>
<p>"It's clear that the virus is spreading and we don't see any evidence of this slowing down at this point," said WHO flu chief Keiji Fukuda at a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization raised the influenza epidemic level from 4 to 5 Wednesday afternoon, signalling that a pandemic is imminent, and urged countries to implement their pandemic plans.</p>
<p>DeLaet, 27, played in just one Canadian Tour event this spring. He played in the Corona Mazatlan Classic Mexican PGA Championship last week but missed the cut.</p>
<p>His plans are to possibly play in a couple of Gateway Tour events in Phoenix before heading to a British Open qualifier May 25 in Texas.</p>
<p>The Canadian segment of the Canadian Tour does not begin until June 1 with the Times Colonist Open in Victoria, B.C.</p>
<p>The Nationwide Tour also announced Wednesday that it was postponing the Mexico Open, which was slated for May 18-24 at the El Bosque Golf Club in Leon, Guanajuato.</p>

</p>
<p>Tiger Woods heads a strong field for the Quail Hollow Championship in Charlotte, N.C., this week as the 14-time major champion makes his first start since the Masters.</p>
<p>World No. 1 Woods will be joined by world No. 2 Phil Mickelson, No. 3 Sergio Garcia of Spain and No. 4 Geoff Ogilvy of Australia.</p>
<p>Woods, who has confirmed he will play this week and in next week's prestigious Players Championship, says he is further ahead than he expected to be at this stage in his return from left knee surgery last June.</p>
<p>"I'm just now starting to get my pop back," said Woods, whose last-day charge at the Masters fell short and left him tied for sixth.</p>
<p>Newly-crowned Masters champion Angel Cabrera of Argentina and three-time major champion Padraig Harrington of Ireland are also entered, as is defending champion Anthony Kim, whose winning total last year was a tournament record 16-under 272.</p>
<p>Woods will be making his fourth appearance at Quail Hollow.</p>
<p>THINKING AHEAD</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, which acquired <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> last year, has taken its name off the tournament this week, which is why it is now called the Quail Hollow Championship.</p>
<p>The bank also acquired a contract with the PGA Tour that runs through 2014, and tournament officials do not expect it to be broken before then.</p>
<p>That likely will be the end of a PGA Tour stop in Charlotte but not necessarily major golf.</p>
<p>PGA of America officials are in town this week as the guest of club president Johnny Harris, who is trying to land the 2017 PGA Championship and the 2024 Ryder Cup.</p>
<p>CANCELLATIONS</p>
<p>Two professional golf tours have postponed upcoming tournaments in Mexico, due to the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>The Canadian Tour announced Wednesday it was postponing this week's San Luis Potosi Open in Mexico, the day after it postponed two other events in Mexico -- the Yucatan Country Club Classic and the Iberostar Riviera Maya Open -- which were slated to follow the San Luis Potosi Open.</p>
<p>The Nationwide Tour also announced Wednesday that it was postponing the Mexico Open, which was slated for May 18-24 at the El Bosque Golf Club in Leon, Guanajuato.</p>
<p>The announcements came on the same day that the World Health Organization raised the alert level to five.</p>
<p>BIG BREAK</p>
<p>Jeff Klauk might know every blade of grass on the Stadium Course at the TPC Sawgrass after growing up watching his father, retired golf course superintendent Fred Klauk, tend to the course for The Players Championship.</p>
<p>Barring an unlikely turn of events, the PGA Tour rookie will see the course next week like never before.</p>
<p>Because two international players have decided not to play, Klauk has earned the final spot in the field next week based on a solid start to his season that has put him 42nd in the <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> Cup standings.</p>
<p>The only way he could lose his spot would be for someone not already eligible to win the Quail Hollow Championship.</p>
<p>DAD DUTIES</p>
<p>Sean O'Hair goes into the U.S. Open with some uncertainty at home, although there is little question he will play.</p>
<p>His wife, Jackie, is expecting their third child on June 25 four days after the U.S. Open at Bethpage Black. They are expecting a boy that they plan to name Grady Quinn.</p>
<p>"Hopefully, he comes the week before, because I'm taking that week off," O'Hair said.</p>

<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>AIR FRANCE CREW REFUSE MEXICO FLIGHT</p>
<p>PARIS - An entire Air France crew and several individual flight attendants have refused to board flights to Mexico since Saturday because of the outbreak of swine flu, airport sources said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Under French law employees may refuse to stay on their job if they have "a reasonable motive" to believe that their health or life is seriously and imminently threatened.</p>
<p>A pilot who was to fly from Paris to Mexico on Saturday refused to do so for health reasons citing the swine flu crisis.</p>
<p>His refusal automatically involved the aircraft's crew which was replaced, airport officials said.</p>
<p>Since Saturday several flight attendants have said they will not fly to Mexico citing "fatigue," the only reason accepted under French industrial law.</p>
<p>FRENCH DEBATE INTERNET PIRACY</p>
<p>PARIS - French parliamentarians revived debate on a bill to crack down on Internet piracy at the behest of President Nicolas Sarkozy on Wednesday after it had been the subject of an embarrassing defeat for the ruling party.</p>
<p>France's parliament rejected on April 9 the government-backed bill that proposed disconnecting Internet users if they downloaded music or films illegally, after the ruling UMP party failed to turn out in force to back the law.</p>
<p>Lulled into a false sense of security, UMP deputies were caught by surprise when socialist opposition members turned up to make their votes count at the last minute.</p>
<p>Culture Minister Christine Albanel described the circumstances surrounding that vote as "incredible."</p>
<p>DAUGHTER SAYS DAD WROTE BOTTLED NOTE</p>
<p>STOCKHOLM - The daughter of one of seven men whose names were in a bottled message found on the grounds of Auschwitz this week said Wednesday that her late father, who fled to Sweden after the war, had written the note.</p>
<p>"I recognized the handwriting. It must be my father's handwriting," Irene Jankowiak told AFP from her home in Uppsala, north of Stockholm.</p>
<p>"We have compared it to other things he has written, we have old letters and things that he wrote in 1945 in a diary so I'm 100 per cent sure actually," she said.</p>
<p>Her father's name, Bronislaw Jankowiak, appears in a message dated Sept. 20, 1944, listing the names and camp ID numbers of seven Auschwitz prisoners aged 18 to 20, all Polish nationals except for one, who worked together on the construction of an air shelter.</p>
<p>Workers found the bottle packed inside the concrete of a wall of a building in the southern Polish town of Oswiecim that served as a warehouse for the camp's Nazi guards during Second World War, now part of a local high school.</p>
<p>SHIP ESCAPES PIRATE ATTACK</p>
<p>ROME - An Italian cargo ship, the Jolly Smeraldo, escaped being hijacked by Somali pirates off the Horn of Africa on Wednesday, Italy's foreign ministry and company officials said.</p>
<p>The pirates attacked some 300 nautical miles southeast of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, as the Italian-owned container vessel travelled to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia from the Kenyan port of Mombasa.</p>
<p>"They fired some shots but after about 10 or 15 minutes they gave up and went away," said Andrea Gais, managing director of the company Messina, which owns the vessel.</p>
<p>On Sunday, an Italian cruise ship used guns and a firehose to beat off a pirate assault. An Italian tug boat with 16 crew onboard, is still being held in northern Somalia after it was seized on April 11.</p>
<p>POLICE BATON CHARGE SHIPYARD WORKERS</p>
<p>WARSAW - Police on Wednesday baton charged a protest by several hundred shipyard workers demonstrating against restructuring plans for the industry that the Polish government is negotiating with the European Union, an AFP correspondent witnessed.</p>
<p>Officers also used pepper spray against the demonstrators who burned tires and threw firecrackers at riot police guarding the entrance of Warsaw's landmark communist-era Palace of Culture.</p>
<p>A congress of the European People's Party was being held at the building.</p>
<p>Several protesters required medical attention.</p>
<p>The workers arrived in Warsaw Wednesday from the Gdansk shipyard on Poland's Baltic Sea coast. In 1980 it became the cradle of the historic Solidarity trade union -- the first and only of its kind in the entire Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>CELL PLANNED 9-11 ANNIVERSARY ATTACKS</p>
<p>DUESSELDORF, Germany - Four suspected Islamic militants on trial for plotting to kill Americans in Germany discussed carrying out bombings on the sixth anniversary of</p>
<p>9-11, police said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Giving evidence in court a week into the trial, the chief police investigator Ralph K. said the three Germans and a Turk were overheard by police discussing Sept. 11, 2007 as a possible date for an attack.</p>
<p>They were also issued with e-mailed orders "to finish the job" by leaders of the Islamic Jihadic Union in Pakistan, an extremist group linked to al-Qaida, shortly before police captured three of them on Sept. 4, 2007, he said.</p>
<p>And just one day before their arrest, when police caught them with enough equipment to make explosives 100 times more powerful than those used in the 2005 London bombings, the leaders told them to act within three weeks, he said.</p>
<p>SUSPECTED NAZI 'UNFIT FOR TRIAL'</p>
<p>VIENNA - Milivoj Asner, a suspected Nazi criminal living in Austria, is unfit to stand trial, a court said Wednesday citing a new psychiatric report.</p>
<p>"He is unfit for questioning and for trial," Klagenfurt court spokesman Norbert Jenny said Wednesday, citing the report by Norbert Nedopil, head of the forensic psychiatry department at the Munich University clinic in Germany.</p>
<p>"Dr. Nedopil did not find anything that the other experts before him did not also find," Jenny said.</p>
<p>Previous Austrian medical reports had concluded that Asner, who has been living quietly in Klagenfurt, in the southern state of Carinthia, since 2006, suffered from dementia and was not fit to be questioned.</p>
<p>TURKISH SOLDIERS KILLED BY BOMB</p>
<p>ISTANBUL - In what could herald the start of a fierce new season of fighting between Turkish troops and Kurdish insurgents, a roadside bombing in the country's southeast killed nine Turkish soldiers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The attack, aimed at a convoy traveling a mountainous road, represented the largest single-incident death toll this year for the Turkish military, which has waged a decades-long struggle with fighters of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK.</p>
<p>The rebels claimed responsibility for the blast, which took place near the town of Lice in Diyarbakir province. Officials described the device as crude but powerful, strong enough to penetrate a tank and an armored vehicle traveling in the convoy.</p>
<p>A 10th Turkish soldier was killed in fighting elsewhere in the mainly Kurdish southeast, the state-run Anatolian news agency said.</p>

<p>AFGHAN ATTACKS MAR MINISTER'S VISIT</p>
<p>KABUL - Two attacks on German troops in Afghanistan Wednesday, killing one soldier, overshadowed the German foreign minister's visit here with Berlin poised to send extra troops ahead of Afghan elections.</p>
<p>Late Wednesday, an attack on a Germany army patrol northwest of the town of Kunduz with grenades and firearms, left one soldier dead and four others "slightly wounded," the German defence ministry said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day five other German soldiers were slightly wounded when a suicide bomber blew himself up in an attack on a German patrol some 15 kilometres south of Kunduz, the defence ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>The attack happened as a German construction team in a Dingo armoured vehicle passed, but there were no casualties to civilians, provincial governor Mohammad Omar told AFP.</p>
<p>UAE PROBING TORTURE VIDEO</p>
<p>DUBAI - The United Arab Emirates said on Wednesday it had launched an investigation into a video tape that appears to show a member of the Gulf Arab state's ruling family torturing an Afghani grains trader.</p>
<p>The video, aired last week by U.S. network ABC, shows the Afghani being abused with an electric cattle prod, beaten with whips and a plank of wood with a nail in it, and driven over by a car in an incident at a desert location in 2004. One of the men, who ABC said is Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al-Nahayan, a brother of the UAE crown prince, pours what the network said was salt into the man's wounds and a man in police uniform takes part.</p>

<p>TOY CHOPPER SPARKS SECURITY SCARE</p>
<p>NEW DELHI - A Chinese-made toy helicopter landed in India's heavily-fortified national parliament Wednesday, sparking a scare and a high security alert, police said.</p>
<p>The remotely operated toy whizzed over the high walls of the parliament building in New Delhi and landed in its forecourt, setting off security alarms, police officials said.</p>
<p>Police and federal officers launched a manhunt around the complex as the battery-operated machine had a flying range of around 150 metres, the officials said.</p>
<p>"The helicopter came in from the direction of the Talkatora Stadium and it was spotted by a sentry who sounded the alarm after it landed inside," a parliament security official told AFP.</p>

<p>ANTANANARIVO - Madagascar security forces arrested the man named prime minister by ousted leader Marc Ravalomanana during a raid on a hotel in the capital Antananarivo on Wednesday, witnesses said.</p>
<p>More than a dozen armed troops loyal to new President Andry Rajoelina's military-backed administration stormed the city's plush Carlton Hotel before seizing Manandafy Rakotonirina.</p>
<p>The naming of several "ministers" by allies of Ravalomanana, who quit power last month under pressure from the army but insists he remains president in exile, has increased confusion over who controls the Indian Ocean island.</p>
<p>MENINGITIS RUNNING RAMPANT IN AFRICA</p>
<p>LAGOS - A meningitis outbreak has killed at least 1,900 people in three west African countries over the past four months, medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"More than 1,900 people infected by meningitis have died since the start of the year in Nigeria, Niger and Chad," said MSF citing combined statistics from the countries' health authorities.</p>

<p>Give that flu a new name, say pig farmers like Windsor's Michael Schertzer.</p>
<p>"Anything but swine flu," Schertzer said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Concern over falling pork prices, export disputes and consumer perceptions has the Canadian Pork Council joining a global push to take the swine out of the swine flu name.</p>
<p>The Canadian Pork Council wants to follow the World Organisation for Animal Health's recommendation and switch to North American influenza. It's asking Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq to have federal officials begin using the new name.</p>
<p>"The name itself that has been used makes people associate the meat at the grocery store as the source and that they could become ill from eating it," Canadian Pork Council spokesman Gary Stordy said Wednesday. "When, in fact, when they're at the grocery store, the person standing next to them is more likely to transmit the flu than the pork because this influenza outbreak is being transmitted by human to human contact." Stordy said consumers won't catch the virus from eating pork.</p>

<p>Six local residents as well as one Mexican migrant worker are now being tested for swine flu, Medical Officer of Health Dr. Allen Heimann said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We have no confirmed cases," Heimann said. He expected laboratory results within a few days.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday afternoon, Canada had 19 confirmed cases of swine flu, including seven in Ontario, but no one was seriously ill. The U.S. was up to 91 confirmed cases with one death suspected of being caused by swine flu.</p>
<p>All those being tested locally have mild flu symptoms, Heimann said. Six of the seven have travelled recently to Mexico, but the migrant worker has been here for some time, he said.</p>
<p>Most local travellers returning from Mexico are showing no flu symptoms, Heimann said. A group of 22 nurses just back Tuesday from a vacation in Mexico, for example, went to Windsor Regional Hospital for screening, but appeared healthy, he said.</p>
<p>Heimann said provincial and federal officials continue to closely monitor the thousands of migrant Mexican workers already in the Leamington area and across southern Ontario.</p>
<p>There's continuing discussion about what methods of surveillance would be most effective, Heimann said. The medical screening of migrant workers in Mexico will catch those showing symptoms of the flu, Heimann said. However, the flu has a seven-day incubation period, so those appearing healthy before leaving Mexico could develop the flu here, he said.</p>
<p>DIEU SCREENING</p>
<p>Concern over swine flu has prompted Hotel-Dieu Grace Hospital to step up its screening measures. According to a release on Wednesday, the hospital has begun limiting its access points, with only its emergency entrance and Goyeau Street entrance open to the public. The lone exception is the renal dialysis unit entrance, which will remain open for patients.</p>
<p>Visitors will be asked to clean their hands, and answer two questions: Do you have a new or worsening cough or shortness of breath, and do you have a fever? Anyone who answers yes to both questions will be asked not to visit the hospital.</p>

<p>The rising fear and confusion in Mexico over the outbreak of swine flu are what Windsor's Sherri Breaton remembers from a "scary trip" she decided to cut short.</p>
<p>"It's alarming to be down there and see all this going on," she said in an interview Wednesday.</p>
<p>She doesn't have any symptoms of the swine flu, but an operation in 1988 to remove her spleen left her with a weakened immune system and made her prone to pneumonia infections.</p>
<p>As a result, she's in self-imposed isolation at home waiting out the seven-day incubation period for the flu and taking Tammiflu, an antiviral medication her doctor prescribed.</p>
<p>She called her doctor the morning after she got back from Mexico, but was told to stay home and the medication would be sent to her.</p>
<p>Breaton's husband Richard works for Valiant at a large Chrysler truck plant in Saltillo, Mexico, more than 600 kilometres north of Mexico City, where most cases and deaths from swine flu have been reported.</p>
<p>But when Breaton left for Mexico last Friday, the level of concern in Canada over swine flu appeared minimal.</p>
<p>And even her first day in Saltillo on Saturday seemed normal, with crowds filling the streets and marketplace, she recalled. But by Sunday, the sense of normality had drastically changed. Government workers were stopping cars to hand out leaflets in Spanish warning of swine flu.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it seemed everybody was donning face masks, Breaton said.</p>
<p>She didn't hear of any cases of swine flu being reported in Saltillo, although she's since learned of some in the area.</p>
<p>Soon, there was a shortage of masks in area stores. Breaton said Valiant quickly sent down supplies of masks to its small group of employees in Saltillo.</p>
<p>She decided to cut her visit short and flew back from Monterey, Mexico, to Detroit on Monday night.</p>
<p>"I was afraid they were going to close the border down," Breaton said. "I was nervous."</p>
<p>The scene at the Monterey Airport was a little alarming, with passengers on flights coming from Mexico City all wearing masks, Breaton said.</p>
<p>About three-quarters of the passengers on her flight to Detroit also donned masks, she said. They were all anxious because one of their fellow passengers was coughing frequently, she said.</p>
<p>But at Detroit Metropolitan Airport Breaton was surprised at how little concern officials expressed over the arrivals from Mexico.</p>
<p>"Nobody said one word to me," Breaton said. She had expected the coughing passenger to be quickly whisked away, but nothing unusual happened.</p>
<p>Even when she crossed the border into Windsor, Breaton said she wasn't questioned about where she'd been.</p>
<p>Breaton talks daily with her husband and the level of concern over the flu in Saltillo seems to have eased. However, each worker at the Chrysler plant is wearing a face mask, she said.</p>
<p>Breaton has a few more days to go before she can be sure she hasn't got the swine flu.</p>
<p>Her husband is due back for a short visit in just over a week. With her weakened immune system, she's a little nervous about the reunion.</p>
<p>She jokes that her husband may find himself in isolation at home -- maybe in the garage.</p>

<p>Canadian stocks rebounded after a two-day slide at the start of the week as positive earnings reports and rising commodity prices buoyed investor confidence.</p>
<p>The S&P/TSX composite index climbed 68.28 points or 0.7%, yesterday, to close at 9416.31. Gainers outpaced losers almost three-to-one on Canada's main exchange with six of 10 subindices closing in the positive territory. The TSX venture exchange was also higher, adding 20.87 points or 2.1% to 1013.97.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar, meanwhile, climbed to US83.13¢, up US1.2¢ as the U. S. dollar fell sharply on concerns about rising long-term interest rates in the United States.</p>
<p>"In general, there was more encouraging news [yesterday] than discouraging news today," said David Baskin, president of Baskin Financial Services in Toronto. In addition to a list of solid earnings on both sides of the border, he thinks people are becoming less concerned about the repercussions of the swine flu on the overall economy as reports surface downplaying its impact.</p>
<p>He added that the latest GDP figures, while worse-than-expected, were not all bad, noting that consumer spending continues to remain strong. "I think there is a growing consensus that if we are not at the bottom of the economic cycle we are very close to there, because we are seeing a few indicators that are turning from down to flat."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Customers' frugality crimps Rogers profit; Swine flu travel limits could cut roaming revenue</b>
</div><div>Jamie Sturgeon   </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>770 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>FP4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>In 2003, just as <span class="companylink">Rogers Communications Inc</span>. was ascending toward dominance of the Canadian cellphone market, SARS threw the Torontobased company for a loop as heavily restricted travel across the country cut into mobile roaming revenue.</p>
<p>"It was definitely a noticeable impact," Rob Bruce, Rogers president of wireless operations, said yesterday. Six years later, a second mysterious bug poses the same threat as the company rises again toward an enviable leadership position in the next phase of Canada's wireless evolution, the smartphone.</p>
<p>"To the extent that we see the swine flu accelerate, we can expect to see some softening of roaming revenue," Mr. Bruce said.</p>
<p>Barring a more serious outbreak, greater threats loom for Rogers.</p>
<p>"One is the economy," said Greg MacDonald, equity analyst at National Bank Financial. "The other is the repricing in the product base."</p>
<p>Rogers reported that both forces contributed to downward pressure on revenue last quarter.</p>
<p>To start, recession-induced frugality among customers kept them from venturing too far outside of their plans to make long-distance calls, use up more minutes or download new applications. Moreover, the sluggish economy has exacerbated the longer-term trend of eroding average revenue per user (ARPU) among Rogers and its rivals, <span class="companylink">Telus Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">BCE Inc</span>., as each unrolls ever-cheaper plans, notably among their discount brands such as Rogers' Fido and Telus's Koodo.</p>
<p>Yet much like in 2003, the company is again positioning itself as the clear winner in a competitive fight for share in a lucrative market that is ballooning -- smartphones. Able to offer rapid Internet surfing and downloading capabilities, the agile devices are by far the fastest-growing wireless category in the country, and Rogers is moving ahead of both rivals.</p>
<p>Mr. Bruce said almost one-quarter of the company's eight million prepaid and postpaid subscriber accounts are now smartphones. Unlike Telus or BCE, Rogers managed to hold the line on ARPU last quarter -- down a nominal 0.16% to $61.57 a month. By contrast, Vancouver-based Telus warned this month its average revenue per account has dropped 5.6% to $58.39.</p>
<p>Part of Rogers' advantage lies in its GSM network, which is more advanced than either Telus's or BCE's. It landed Rogers exclusive rights to <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>.'s iPhone 3G in Canada last summer, and the iPhone has sold in spades.</p>
<p>"We've been very, very pleased," Mr. Bruce said. The result of torrid smartphone sales has been a 43% rise in wireless-data revenue in the last quarter alone.</p>
<p>Rogers has also gone after the most dynamic smartphone offering among carriers, said National Bank's Mr. Mac-Donald. "They have a better mix so they sell more smartphones," the analyst said, noting Rogers' equally brisk sales of its BlackBerry models made by Waterloo, Ont.-based <span class="companylink">Research In Motion Ltd</span>.</p>
<p>Like its rivals, Rogers has subsidized smartphone handsets to push the devices into the marketplace faster, with the aim of securing greater long-term returns through multi-year contracts. Rogers spent $154-million in subsidies last quarter alone. The charge helped cut profit by 10% in the three months ended March 31 to $308-million.</p>
<p>"It's impacting margins up front," said Troy Crandall, analyst at Montreal-based MacDougall, MacDougall & MacTier Inc. "But we're eventually going to see the overall benefit on ARPU, and that's because there's so many more ways to make money off someone with a smartphone," he said.</p>
<p>The quarterly dip in profit stemmed largely from the company's struggling media unit, in which slumping advertising sales are hurting Rogers' publishing, radio and television assets. Its cable unit also underperformed.</p>
<p>Wireless revenue climbed 8% in the quarter to $1.544-billion, helping to lift overall revenue 5% to $2.75-billion.</p>
<p>Nadir Mohamed, appointed to the chief executive post last month, succeeding company founder Ted Rogers, said the company was not immune to recession, nor the longer-term trends affecting the wireless industry.</p>
<p>"But we're holding our own," Mr. Mohamed said. "We're still growing."</p>
<p>One of his priorities is to maintain Rogers as the leading growth company in wireless, Mr. MacDonald said. "They're already doing that and, given the mix, I would expect it to continue."</p>

</p>
<p>A Quebec City biotechnology firm expects to have a new vaccine for swine flu ready for human testing in about a month.</p>
<p>Medicago Inc. said yesterday it has notified Health Canada that it began laboratory work on Monday to produce an inoculation for swine flu.</p>
<p>"We will see if we can produce it with our technology and test it on mice then humans by the end of May," Medicago spokesperson Arianna Vanin said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>She said the start-up company can create influenza vaccines one month after a pandemic is declared compared with six months for traditional technologies.</p>
<p>"We don't use viruses, but virus-like particles injected into tobacco plants," Vanin said. "We're the only ones in Canada doing it." The particles resemble viruses and trigger an immune response in the body.</p>
<p>The common bacterium injected into the tobacco results in protein being harvested in the leaves.</p>
<p>"We believe that the tobacco plant represents a natural vehicle to meet the needs of rapid and cost-effective production of vaccines," Andy Sheldon, Medicago's president, said last fall when the publicly traded firm announced a $16-million investment by global tobacco giant Philip Morris International.</p>
<p>"Medicago's tobacco-based technology platform makes it an ideal fit for PMI in exploring adjacent opportunities where synergies exist with our current field of knowledge and our R&D activities," Sheldon added in November.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Quebec face mask companies ramping up production; 'There's lots of pressure to meet the demand,' executive at one firm says</b>
</div><div>MIKE KING   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>408 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Quebec's only two firms with patented technology to kill bacteria and viruses are ramping up production of their anti-microbial face masks.</p>
<p>"There's lots of pressure to meet the demand," said Benoit Sicotte, general manager of Triosyn Research Inc. in Mirabel, pointing to the company's entire North American stock of nearly 40,000 masks selling out completely in the U.S. alone on Monday.</p>
<p>After being flooded with phone calls starting at the end of last week with the outbreak of swine flu, it was decided at a meeting Monday that Triosyn's 100,000-mask inventory in Malaysia, where they are manufactured, will be available to the Canadian and Mexican markets.</p>
<p>"This happened so fast, we're trying to accelerate production," Sicotte said.</p>
<p>The maximum production capacity is about 5,000 a day.</p>
<p>The masks sell for about $6 each.</p>
<p>Triosyn Corp., which was founded in 1992 and acquired in the fall of 2006 by San Diego-based Safe Life Corp., created anti-microbial technology specifically designed to preserve health and business continuity in the face of pandemics, threats of bioterrorism and environmental disasters.</p>
<p>Its fitted masks, with a polymer lining treated with an iodine-based compound, is 100 to 1,000 times more effective at trapping and killing harmful micro-organisms - and is effective longer - than most similar masks, according to clinical tests conducted by Health Canada, the U.S. Air Force Research Labs and France's Pasteur Institute.</p>
<p>André Leroux, CEO and chairman of Montreal's <span class="companylink">Noveko International Inc</span>., predicted the company's inventory of 10 million anti- microbial masks should go quickly.</p>
<p>"If we had 500 million in stock, we could sell them all," Leroux said.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, he said, the world market for the masks is about $7 billion a year.</p>
<p>With the swine flu outbreak, the market could jump to $10 billion.</p>
<p>Noveko could increase production of the masks, which sell for about 20 cents each, at its facilities, south of the border and in China, to between 10 million and 15 million daily.</p>
<p>"Our target is 200 million a month," Leroux said.</p>

</div><div>SOPHIE NICHOLSON   </div>
<div>AFP</div>

</p>
<p>Mexico City has told food vendors to stop serving sit-down customers, but that is one order that 37-year-old café owner Rene Perez Lozano is not happy to take.</p>
<p>"It's easy to tell us to close, but how are we going to live?" Perez asked. "They say it's for my health but either I'll die from the disease or I'll die from hunger."</p>
<p>Yesterday, Perez sat in a neighbourhood restaurant discussing news that sit-down service to customers would be prohibited in eateries until May 6, the latest government measure to try to contain the spread of swine flu.</p>
<p>Take-out service will be allowed, but that is little comfort for Perez and thousands like him across this sprawling city of 20 million.</p>
<p>"For small businesses, 10 days is too much. The politicians live in a wonderland, so far from reality," he said, punching numbers into a phone as he tried to glean more details about the ordinance he heard over the radio.</p>
<p>Business is already bad, with sales cut in half since the first news of the outbreak last Thursday, he said, lamenting the growing atmosphere of fear.</p>
<p>"Yesterday two people sneezed in the metro car I was in and everyone jumped and looked at them. I said to myself, 'They're not going to lynch them, are they?' "</p>
<p>Mexico's federal government has already imposed the nationwide temporary closure of all schools and restricted the opening of bars, restaurants and other venues where people congregate.</p>
<p>"The measures are increasing every day. Tomorrow I think that everyone will close. The economic impact is so tough," said David Bishop, who is in charge of sales at a nearby ice cream parlour.</p>
<p>"This week will be a disaster and the next one, too," the 28-year-old said, criticizing the government for failing to communicate with an increasingly panicked public.</p>
<p>"Yesterday, two officials from the Health Ministry came in and even they didn't know what was going on," Bishop said.</p>
<p>Shutters slid down in luxury restaurants and tiny taco bars across the normally busy Roma district, following warnings that any establishment that flouts the latest decree would be shut and fined.</p>
<p>The total number of establishments affected in the capital was not known, but would count in the thousands.</p>
<p>Music blared from behind the half-closed shutters of a normally lively family restaurant as waiter Enrique Morales stood outside with a group of colleagues preparing to leave.</p>
<p>"Customers have halved since Thursday. We're closing until May 6," said the 43-year-old father of three.</p>
<p>"We're supposed to be getting our monthly salaries but they're not very much. Normally we live off tips.</p>
<p>"I'm going to stay with my children at home. They're bored and desperate there. (The authorities) said we can't take them out to parks or on the streets."</p>
<p>Several shops down, a large piece of pork sat on a kebab skewer at the side of a meat restaurant with just two customers.</p>
<p>Owner Lucia Paz Robles learned of the new measure on the Internet and said she might close completely until May 6.</p>
<p>Meat sales were down 50 per cent, she said, with no customers now buying the Mexican speciality pork taco, "taco al pastor."</p>
<p>"The minute you hear the word 'pork' it has an impact," Paz said. "But the scientists say it's fine."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No time for panic or for callousness</b>
</div><div>The Gazette</div>
<div>418 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>There's a limit to how much governments can do to control any sudden new threat of contagious disease, such as this week's swine flu. Doing too little, or showing too little concern, runs the risk of being called callous if the death toll spikes. But over-reaction can be a menace if it leads to public panic.</p>
<p>One U.S. congressman has demanded, preposterously, that the Mexico-U.S. border be sealed. That's panic. And Michael O'Leary, head of the Irish discount airline Ryanair, said the outbreak "is a tragedy only for people living ... in slums in Asia or Mexico." That's callousness.</p>
<p>In Canada the public-health response to swine flu seems to have neither of those extremes. Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq has trusted her officials, notably chief public-health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones. She even spoke with Opposition health critics before her Sunday press conference.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq is a rookie in Ottawa but was health minister of Nunavut. After the 2002-03 SARS outbreak she took part in developing a federal-provincial pandemic plan. Her calm vigilance now strikes us as exactly the right approach.</p>
<p>So far the death toll from this new strain of flu, even in Mexico, is not significantly higher than the flu toll in almost any year.</p>
<p>Was Mexico slow in responding to this outbreak? That is to be expected in a poor country. And new diseases rarely emerge from wealthy enclaves - the worst-nourished, least-cared-for populations incubate new contagions the best.</p>
<p>Sealing borders, or even restricting travel, won't help, the World Health Organization notes, because you can be infected but without symptoms for several days.</p>
<p>Nor is a rushed mass vaccination scheme much use, since vaccines take months to develop and produce. In 1976 a swine flu took hold in the U.S., and President Gerald Ford ordered the whole country inoculated. Vaccine production took a long time, but 40 million Americans got shots before the program was abandoned after 30 people died of a vaccine side-effect.</p>
<p>Canada, provinces, cities, and many employers have flu-epidemic plans in hand, developed after the SARS outbreak and fine-tuned for fear of bird flu. But this disease will have to strike Canada much harder than it has done so far before those plans are needed.</p>
<p>For governments, as for individuals, this is a time for alert calm caution, and not for over-reaction.</p>

</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK   </div>

</p>
<p>Canada stepped up its screening measures at airports yesterday to check passengers returning from Mexico for swine-flu symptoms amid news that the virus now has infected 13 Canadians in four provinces.</p>
<p>Seven new cases were confirmed yesterday - two in Alberta, four in Ontario and one in British Columbia - adding to six announced Sunday. All have links with travel to Mexico, where the illness is suspected of killing more than 150 people and sickening at least 1,600.</p>
<p>Canadians who choose to maintain their travel plans to Mexico, despite a travel warning issued Monday by the Public Health Agency of Canada to delay trips if possible, will face questions about their health from customs officers upon their return. Border agents at airports have been directed to ask passengers whether they have any of the swine flu symptoms - fever, fatigue, lack of appetite, coughing, sore throat, vomiting and diarrhea - or whether they have been in contact with anyone who has symptoms.</p>
<p>If anyone answers "yes" they will be assessed further and possibly referred to a quarantine officer who may then advise travellers to go home and self-isolate or to go to a hospital.</p>
<p>"These measures will help to prevent further spread and protect the health of Canadians and we thank you for your patience and co-operation with this process," Dr. David Butler-Jones, chief public health officer, said yesterday.</p>
<p>Airline passengers will also receive handouts with information about swine flu and will hear public service announcements on the plane.</p>
<p>But Canadians who were planning on travelling to Mexico soon are out of luck if they were booked on an <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span> flight. The airline announced yesterday that all flights to Mexico with <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span> and its partner tour companies - Transat Holidays and Nolitours - have been cancelled until June 1. Customers will receive a credit for travel anywhere the airline flies that must be used before the end of October.</p>
<p>WestJet and WestJet Vacations announced yesterday evening it will stop flying and vacation planning for Cancun, Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan, and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, effective Monday, May 4.</p>
<p>Air Canada announced last evening that it will maintain its scheduled flights into Mexico City. But the airline also said customers with flights booked to Cancun, Cozumel and Puerto Vallarta between now and June 1 can rebook their holiday with no change fees.</p>
<p>Swine flu has now spread far beyond Mexico however, with more than 80 cases now confirmed in the United States, Canada, Spain, Scotland, Israel and New Zealand. There are also suspected cases in many more countries but laboratory tests have not yet confirmed whether they are cases of swine flu.</p>
<p>The United States now has at least 64 confirmed cases in five states. Ten cases are in California which declared a state of emergency yesterday to tackle the outbreak.</p>
<p>Authorities in Los Angeles County are investigating what might be the first U.S. death from swine flu. Test results from a man who exhibited flu-like symptoms before dying in a hospital were inconclusive.</p>
<p>Both Canadian and American officials have been warning the public to expect deaths from swine flu.</p>
<p>The new Canadian cases reported yesterday came as no surprise to health officials.</p>
<p>"Today's new cases were anticipated by the government and by public health officials and they do not change our course of action," Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said .</p>
<p>B.C. now has a total of three swine flu cases and Nova Scotia has four. The cases in Canada are all considered mild.</p>
<p>The health minister said the federal government is following a six-point plan to deal with the swine flu outbreak, and is "on top of what is happening."</p>
<p>World health authorities are warning the swine flu outbreak could develop into a pandemic. Its spread around the globe and its person-to-person transmission prompted the World Health Organization on Monday afternoon to heighten its global pandemic alert system from level three to four.</p>
<p>WHO said the change is a signal that the world is a step closer to a pandemic but that one is not inevitable.</p>
<p>During a daily news briefing, WHO's assistant director-general of health security, Keiji Fukuda, said countries should anticipate what their needs will be in the event that the outbreak does develop into a pandemic, and that it will be a global responsibility to assist developing countries.</p>
<p>"They are really hit hardest and they also have the least resources to deal with these situations," he said.</p>
<p>While the world's attention has been drawn to the quickly developing situation in recent days, Fukuda also cautioned yesterday that other health issues should not be neglected.</p>
<p>"While we deal with this situation, it's important for WHO but it's also important for other health agencies and countries out there to be mindful there are other health priorities that continue to need attention," he said.</p>
<p>In partnership with laboratories around the world, WHO is working on making the agents needed to diagnose swine flu in case countries need them, and work is under way on developing a vaccine if one is needed.</p>
<p>Researchers are struggling to understand why the virus, which has a genetic makeup that has never been seen before, has been deadly only in Mexico and why it seems to severely affect relatively young and healthy people.</p>
<p>WHO said even if countries are successful in mitigating the spread of the virus and its incidence goes down, it likely will be months before the outbreak can be declared over.</p>
<p>"It will be very hard to know whether this virus has actually disappeared until several months have gone by at the very least," Fukuda said. "That's the nature of this infection and that is something we will be on the lookout for."</p>
<p>Among the many other questions researchers will be trying to answer in the coming weeks is nailing down why the outbreak appears to be affecting people more severely than the regular flu, which also can be deadly.</p>

</p>
<p>Edmontonians wanting to escape the seemingly endless wintry weather will have fewer options for flights to Mexico in the wake of mounting concerns about swine flu.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Air Transat</span> and Sunwing vacations on Tuesday cancelled all flights to Mexico after the World Health Organization raised the pandemic alert to Phase 4 and Public Health Agency of Canada issued an advisory warning against travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>"As of April 27, 2009, travellers from Canada are recommended to postpone elective or non-essential travel to Mexico until further notice," was the message on PHAC's website.</p>
<p>WestJet also announced Tuesday it will suspend service to Cancun, Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta as of May 4.</p>
<p>All <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span> flights to Mexico are suspended until June 1, but the airline will maintain returning flights until May 3, according to a travel advisory on the company website. Sunwing will delay all Mexico flights until May 29.</p>
<p>Customers of both companies can change their destinations or switch the dates of their trips to Mexico as long as the trips are completed by Oct. 31, 2009.</p>
<p>Passengers will be required to cover any difference in costs associated with the changes.</p>
<p>WestJet service will resume to Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta on June 20, the airline said in a news release. Service to Cancun, a seasonal destination for WestJet, will return in the fall schedule.</p>
<p>People who were scheduled to fly to Mexico between now and June 20 can change their travel plans with no charge or cancellation fees, the airline said. Or they can get a full refund.</p>
<p>Though swine flu is on the mind of many travellers, two Tuesday morning flights to Mexico from Edmonton International Airport were largely business as usual.</p>
<p>Passengers flying to Mexico City and Cancun were warned of the public health advisory when they checked in, said airport spokeswoman Traci Bednard.</p>
<p>But people interviewed by The Journal who were booked on a WestJet flight to Cancun said they were prepared.</p>
<p>"A little flu bug isn't going to stop me," said Doug Klementovich. "Do you think I would give up spending my 50th birthday in Cancun just because somebody's got a little bug?"</p>
<p>The businessman spends four months of the year in Mexico. He flies out every month for a week and equates this swine flu talk to the SARS scare of a few years ago. He said he'll wash his hands as much as possible, but won't wear a mask. Cancun is a long way from Mexico City, he said.</p>
<p>"Did you wear a mask in Edmonton just because there was SARS in Toronto?"</p>
<p>Shawn MacDonald, 26, is a little more nervous. "I also know how everything gets so hyped up."</p>
<p>He got a flu shot and packed plenty of hand sanitizer for his trip to Cancun. He said he'd just returned to the city after five months in Mexico when the swine flu news broke. He went to the doctor and got cleared, and said he's going back down to do some marketing for a hotel.</p>
<p>Edmonton school boards have been more cautious. The Edmonton public school district has cancelled all travel outside of Canada and all air travel within Canada for field trips and business trips, said spokeswoman Jane Farrell. Letters will be sent home with students Tuesday, she said.</p>
<p>Lori Nagy, spokeswoman for the Catholic board, said all field trips -- including two that were to leave this week -- and all staff business trips are cancelled until further notice. There are six other field trips planned for May that could also be affected, Nagy said in a statement.</p>
<p>Cancun is bracing for an outbreak, and officials are discouraging people from congregating in large public groups, said a woman who lives in the city. Dianne Azoulay has dual Canadian-Mexican citizenship and said she'll catch a flight back to Cancun on Friday.</p>
<p>Azoulay said people in Cancun are "nervous." The city supply of an anti-influenza drug called Tamiflu has been routed to Mexico City, the epicentre of reported cases. Numerous countries around the world have been stockpiling Tamiflu and similar drugs in preparation for a possible pandemic.</p>
<p>Azoulay went to a doctor in Edmonton hoping she could get the drug here, but was told it is only being administered to people who display symptoms of swine flu.</p>

<p>Illness - Companies began restricting employee travel in response to a potential flu pandemic that has claimed about 150 lives in Mexico and weighed stronger measures, while an unconfirmed case at Ernst & Young led the firm to close a portion of its New York office.</p>
<p>In New York, Ernst & Young said it could no longer confirm an employee has a verified case of the swine flu--underscoring the fast-changing nature of events.</p>
<p>The accounting firm earlier told staff in its Times Square tower they could work from home after a female staff member was initially said to be diagnosed with swine flu. It also told employees on assignment or holiday in Mexico to consider returning home and avoid travel if ill.</p>

</p>
<p>A lberta confirmed its first swine flu infections in two people -- including a Calgarian -- Tuesday as the total number of Canadian cases of the new disease rose to 13 and federal officials warned more serious illnesses from the virus are likely.</p>
<p>The Alberta patients are both men, one from Calgary and the other from an undisclosed community in northern Alberta, who developed a mild case of swine flu after recently travelling to Mexico.</p>
<p>"We have two confirmed cases of human swine flu,"said Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical health officer, at a press conference Tuesday. "Both had a very mild form of illness. . . . Neither of them required hospitalization."</p>
<p>The new form of swine flu, which health officials around the world are monitoring as a possible pandemic, also thwarted travel plans for thousands of Canadians as several airlines began cancelling flights Tuesday to the sun destination.</p>
<p>Air Canada and WestJet were among several airlines and tour operators suspending or altering travel to Mexico because of the flu outbreak.</p>
<p>The virus, which originated in Mexico, has sickened about 1,600 people in that country and led the World Health Organization to raise its pandemic alert level earlier this week.</p>
<p>Eighty swine flu cases are now confirmed in the United States, Canada, Spain, Scotland, Israel and New Zealand, while suspected cases are being investigated in several other countries.</p>
<p>Canadian health officials confirmed four new swine flu infections in Ontario and an additional case in B. C. on Tuesday, in addition to the Alberta cases. The first cases for Ontario include one man and three women in their 20s who live in the Toronto area. The B.C. case is a 30-year-old woman from Victoria.</p>
<p>Canada's first swine flu cases, four in Nova Scotia and two in B. C.,were confirmed Sunday. Public Health Agency of Canada officials said Tuesday they anticipated additional cases and said all infections so far have been mild.But the agency cautioned it expects more serious cases to emerge in Canada, some potentially fatal.</p>
<p>"While we hope not, we do expect to see more cases, more severe illnesses and . . . unfortunately some deaths," said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer. "That is a normal part of any flu outbreak."</p>
<p>In the Alberta cases, both men have fully or nearly fully recovered from their illnesses, according to officials. Alberta Health is following up with the patients' family members and their contacts and monitoring them for signs of the disease.No one has been quarantined.</p>
<p>Corriveau would not release the ages of the two men, although he said they were not elderly, and didn't know where in Mexico they had been. The two cases are not connected.</p>
<p>Alberta's provincial laboratory, which now has the capacity to diagnose swine flu, con-firmed the cases late Monday. They weren't announced until Tuesday because the patients had to be notified.</p>
<p>Several airline passengers arriving Tuesday night in Calgary from Mexico said the outbreak</p>
<p>has them worried. The Jimenez family, from northwest Calgary, wore facemasks while in Mexico City, at the airport and on the plane ride home.</p>
<p>"The situation is critical in Mexico and we didn't want to take a chance, so I went out and bought masks for my family," said Alejandro Jimenez, 44. "We are worried about getting the virus and we don't know if Canada has the antivirus, so we needed to be safe."</p>
<p>Alberta Health officials said the risk to most Albertans is "close to zero."Corriveau said doctors are only concerned about Albertans who have travelled to Mexico and aren't feeling well.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach said any escalation of the situation would be a top priority. "At this particular time, there are two cases . . . I just ask everybody, calm down," said Stelmach.</p>
<p>The province is recommending anyone who has returned from Mexico and is sick to stay home and call HealthLink be-fore seeking medical attention. Alberta's medical system has been on alert for swine flu since Sunday;doctors said they have been instructed how to treat potentially infected patients.</p>
<p>"If someone has symptoms, it tells you who to call and how to test for influenza," said Dr. Linda Slocombe, president of the Calgary and Area Physicians' Association.</p>

<p>You have some questions and we have some answers. But rest assured, the odds of you contracting swine flu are slim to none.</p>
<p>"The (level of concern) for the average Albertan should be close to zero," says Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health. Here are other facts on the swine flu outbreak. - What are swine flu Symptoms?</p>
<p>Symptoms include headache, chills, cough followed by fever, loss of appetite, muscle aches, fatigue, runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes and throat irritation, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are also possible. Severe forms can develop into pneumonia. - What do I do if I suspect I have swine flu?</p>
<p>Become a recluse until your symptoms disappear. Stay home, rest and drink lots of fluids. - If I have a planned trip to Mexico, should I go?</p>
<p>No. The Canadian public health agency is advising all Canadians "to postpone elective or non-essential travel to Mexico." - Is it OK to eat pork Products?</p>
<p>Yes. "There is no evidence human swine influenza can be transmitted by food products," says Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer. - Should I get a flu vaccine? Will it help?</p>
<p>Existing vaccines do not contain this swine flu virus, so it's unlikely they will offer protection.</p>

</p>
<p>My local drugstore, probably like yours, is experiencing a run on hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>You know, those tiny bottles of crystal clear, germ-killing gels, the sort you see a lot of politicians squeezing into their palms after shaking too many strangers' hands. Oh, maybe you didn't get to see that germ-removal ritual of politics?</p>
<p>Anyway, I digress.</p>
<p>I just got back from Mexico. Since my return, I've been asked dozens of times whether my sneezing is a harmless allergy to our late-blooming cherry blossoms or perhaps something I picked up on a Mexican beach. I expect boxes of surgical masks -- and lots of hand sanitizer -- to arrive, anonymously, in the mail forthwith.</p>
<p>When I asked a pal to go for a cocktail, to catch up and maybe show off my tan, he e-mailed back almost instantly. His response went something along this line: Are you loco? Weren't you just in Mexico?</p>
<p>We're not panicking as if we're living through Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain. We're not marching through the streets here with statues of the Catholic saints, as Mexicans are. But people are clearly worried. We're all afraid of the killer global germ.</p>
<p>And who can blame us?</p>
<p>The last big pandemic, the dreaded Hong Kong flu, killed a million on this continent in 1968. The Spanish flu took 50 million people in 1918. Scientists have been warning of a repeat any time. So hoarding hand gels, masks and praying to religious icons are not entirely illogical reactions.</p>
<p>But I've been putting my faith in another form of prevention. It's called our health care system.</p>
<p>It's often maligned. But when it comes to dealing with an outbreak of a global bug, it's pretty much top of the heap.</p>
<p>Don't take my word for it. Just think back to 2003, when the deadly SARS crisis hit.</p>
<p>Being a key transit hub from Hong Kong and China, Vancouver was under serious threat when SARS -- Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -- began crossing the Pacific, transported by unknowing passengers. But Vancouver General Hospital rose to the occasion magnificently, with its emergency staff, intensive care units and infection control experts isolating the first case, Patient Zero, almost immediately. We were the envy of the world.</p>
<p>The B.C. Centre for Disease Control and the office of the provincial health officer spelled out that now-forgotten accomplishment in a citation accompanying an award of excellence: "B.C. avoided the major outbreak of SARS experienced in Toronto, where 247 probable cases and 43 deaths occurred, most of them a result of hospital-based spread within Ontario. Three of five international importations of SARS to Canada came through Vancouver, but spread to only one other person. In total, there were just four probable cases of SARS in B.C. and no deaths."</p>
<p>That wasn't the only triumph.</p>
<p>Vancouver scientists also won the global race to identify the deadly virus. After six days of around-the-clock work, they beat teams in the U.S., Japan, Hong Kong and Europe in mapping the genetic code of the killer virus. That was key in identifying SARS and tracing it back to its origin -- the animal markets of southern China, where people were eating SARS-infected civet cats.</p>
<p>Now, SARS is different from the Mexican swine flu. The mutation of viruses is a mystery. Luck is always a big factor in containment. But there's no need to panic. If there is an outbreak, history suggests we're in the best hands this country -- in fact the world -- can offer.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tourism officials twitchy about flu; Mexican market could be at risk: Weaker loonie, conventions might help</b>
</div><div>MAX HARROLD   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>604 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Swine flu fears are hampering Montreal's tourism prospects, but a healthy convention season and a weaker Canadian dollar should keep the $2.1-billion industry afloat, the city's tourism agency predicts.</p>
<p>An estimated 80,000 Mexicans visit Montreal annually, and most do so between May and October, Tourism Montreal head Charles Lapointe said yesterday.</p>
<p>That market is now at risk over concerns about spreading the virus that is suspected to have killed at least 152 Mexicans and has spread to 16 countries around the world.</p>
<p>Canadian health officials have advised against non-essential travel to Mexico, but they haven't restricted travel from Mexico - at least not yet.</p>
<p>"We are nervous about that," Lapointe said. "If this crisis continues, this market may fall."</p>
<p>The average tourist in Montreal spends about $450 over three days, so the annual influx of Mexicans in Montreal represents $36 million.</p>
<p>Tourism will also take a hit because of the loss of the Grand Prix, Lapointe said. Visitors spent $45 million on restaurants and hotels during the event each year, according to tourism board estimates.</p>
<p>"That was a big bonanza for the city," Lapointe said.</p>
<p>But Mexicans and F1 fans are just part of the city's tourist catch, he added, and healthy bookings for conventions and a weaker Canadian dollar should help to keep the tourism industry afloat.</p>
<p>Tourism Montreal estimates 6.8 million tourists will visit Montreal in 2009, a 1.6-per-cent drop over last year. Tourist expenditures, however, should stay the same as last year, at $2.1 billion, mainly because of healthy business conference bookings.</p>
<p>The city's hotel occupancy rate is expected to drop again this year to 62 per cent. Montreal's tourism industry supported 58,159 jobs in 2008.</p>
<p>The biggest single dark cloud continues to be the steadily declining number of u.s. tourists to Montreal and other Canadian cities, Lapointe said. Last year, that decline was 6.7 per cent in Montreal.</p>
<p>Tourism Montreal's $9-million annual marketing push will shift this year almost entirely away from print and billboards to the Web.</p>
<p>Five Montreal-based bloggers are being paid to promote Montreal in arts and culture, wining and dining, nightlife, gay life and getaways for women.</p>
<p>Although they'll be paid by Tourism Montreal, the bloggers will not be censored by the agency, Lapointe said. But the bloggers might respond should there be a negative strain of comments about the city on the blogs, he added.</p>
<p>"They have their own opinions," he said.</p>
<p>Tourism Montreal's website will be interactive starting in September, when visitors to the site will be able to book vacation packages there.</p>
<p>Lapointe said the shift to the Web is "a gamble but it's based on solid assumptions." Eighty per cent of U.S. tourists use the Internet to book their travel, he said.</p>

</p>
<p>It's likely beyond containment now, but to describe the Mexican swine flu outbreak as a potential rerun of the Spanish influenza pandemic seems, subject to change without notice, wildly alarmist.</p>
<p>The 1918 influenza pandemic claimed 50,000 of Canada's 8 million citizens, almost as many casualties as the First World War, while statistically shortening the average lifespan by 10 years. One doctor observed at the time that some patients "died struggling to clear their airways of a blood-tinged froth that sometimes gushed from their nose and mouth."</p>
<p>Yuck.</p>
<p>That virus hit with astonishing speed in an age before vaccines were mass-produced. One newspaper reported that four women had been happily playing bridge late into the night. By the next morning, three were dead.</p>
<p>The Alberta government ordered all residents to wear masks outdoors that horrific autumn. A sneeze or a cough in a public place would cost you a fine in Regina. Funerals in the hardest-hit areas were limited to 15 minutes to clear the body backlog.</p>
<p>Today's swine flu is no 1918 influenza, so perish the comparison.</p>
<p>The infected number hit 13 across four provinces yesterday as the government ramped up a travel warning against going to Mexico.</p>
<p>At statistical face value, lathering up the current outbreak into an all-consuming global crisis, one that saw U.S. President Barack Obama unleash $1.8 billion for American defences against the bug, seems ludicrous.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization says 1,900 Mexicans are being monitored for showing symptoms of the virus, but there are only 26 confirmed cases. The rest of the world combined has still not cracked into triple digits and symptoms have been so regular-flu mild, most victims are fully recovered before tests confirm they had the virus.</p>
<p>Even so, the WHO went to unprecedented Phase 4 of its six-stage alert to signal a sustained human-to-human transmission virus is on the loose, riding jet streams around the world with the capacity to deliver community-wide sickness.</p>
<p>The trouble with assessing pandemic responses is the impossibility of arguing against an abundance of precaution while the scale of the outbreak rages as hypothetical and expert opinion on its potential ranges from grave danger to a basic flu.</p>
<p>But the government of Canada has so far taken a more reasonable response to the swine flu crisis than the U.S. throw-more-money approach or the Asian travel bans to North America, admitting nervous concern and rushing to get a vaccine out without signs of dramatic panic.</p>
<p>While one opposition MP's proposal to strike a special committee to monitor the outbreak was correctly shrugged off by the government as pointless political posturing, questions of the government in the Commons have been a search for important information.</p>
<p>MPs yesterday merely wanted to know the potential timetable for a swine flu vaccine and asked if migrant workers from Mexico, who might be heading here for summer work, would be tested at the border.</p>
<p>Both are legitimate concerns.</p>
<p>Once-invisible Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq has been a steady performer, delivering answers without partisan drama. She stands in favourable contrast to Quebec Premier Jean Charest, who see-sawed between a go and no-go position on travelling to Mexico on a single day.</p>
<p>The website by Health Canada, a federal department ironically born out of the 1918 pandemic, is informative and appears current.</p>
<p>The reaction by medical experts has been equally reassuring. When they know the answer, they give it. When they don't have solid data, they admit that too with a shrug. Deaths are likely as the outbreak spreads, they warned, but to suggest otherwise would be sugar-coating reality.</p>
<p>Every year, 500 to 1,500 Canadians succumb to regular flu strains. It only stands to reason a more severe bug would have similar deadly consequences.</p>
<p>If nothing else, consider the bright side to this ruckus.</p>
<p>If the pandemic fizzles, Mexican vacations next winter will be had at giveaway prices.</p>

<p>CANADA'S EMERGENCY PLAN FOR PANDEMIC</p>
<p>Canada produced its first detailed pandemic flu plan in 1988, and now updates it every few years. A global flu pandemic typically occurs three or four times a century (the last being the "Hong Kong flu" of 1968-69), but public-health officials say it is all but impossible to predict when the next will occur. In a "moderately severe" pandemic scenario, 4.5 million to 10.6 million Canadian would fall ill, and 11,000 to 58,000 Canadians would die, public-health officials estimate. Here are some highlights of Canada's plan, which is overseen by the Public Health Agency of Canada:</p>
<p>Surveillance and alerts: Federal officials would enhance surveillance of flu strains by a network of labs across the country, and push information to the public through updates on the Public Health Agency's website</p>
<p>Vaccine: Canada is one of few countries in the world that has a contract with a private drug manufacturer (GlaxoSmith-Kline) to produce enough flu vaccine for all Canadians. However, supply could initially be scarce so the plan calls for health-care workers and those at high risk to get the vaccine first.</p>
<p>Antivirals: Millions of doses of antiviral drugs, which can reduce symptoms and slow the reproduction of the virus, have already been distributed to the provinces and territories.</p>
<p>Isolation and quarantine: Infected individuals will be isolated at home or hospitals, but officials say it is not feasible to quarantine everyone who may have been exposed. In certain cases, authorities may decide to close schools and daycares.</p>
<p>Communications: Officials have developed a national communications plan to ensure Canadians receive accurate information about the pandemic as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Co-ordination: Other federal departments and agencies could be called into action through Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada, an interdepartmental body created after the 9/11 attacks.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>We're ready for worst, city says; Elaborate emergency plan in place; retired doctors, nurses would be called</b>
</div><div>CHARLIE FIDELMAN, KEVIN DOUGHERTY   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>

</p>
<p>In a worst case scenario of swine flu outbreak, health authorities would take over hotels and run them like hospitals, the head of the Montreal health agency said yesterday.</p>
<p>Montreal's elaborate emergency plan calls for commandeering "non-traditional sites where beds could be set up," said David Levine of the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de Montréal.</p>
<p>Retired and part-time nurses and doctors would be recruited for duty to cover the rising numbers of sick and to make up for staff shortages, Levine said.</p>
<p>The list of recruits would also include people with medical degrees who are currently not practising.</p>
<p>"We are in a unique situation where we have all the elements of a pandemic but the consequences aren't severe," Levine said. "So we are reacting as if it is severe - the guide allows us to ready in case there is a change."</p>
<p>The health department is aware that people want to know what is going on, Levine said: "Who is in charge and how to protect themselves against infection."</p>
<p>The Montreal health agency has published a guide, but the plan does not provide logistic details - for example, what to do with the bodies should the virus mutate and start killing people by the hundreds. It is not yet clear where makeshift morgues would be set up.</p>
<p>Flanked by Montreal's Public Health Department director Terry-Nan Tannenbaum, the agency's assistant executive director, Louise Massicotte, and emergency plan coordinator Lucie-Andrée Roy, Levine said the health department is on high alert.</p>
<p>The agency has been in contact with 89 Montreal health facilities and has taken the necessary action to deal with and stop the spread of swine flu, Levine said.</p>
<p>"We are ready for any eventuality," he said.</p>
<p>As of Friday, hospitals were contacted about dusting off their pandemic emergency plan, Massicotte said.</p>
<p>The pandemic control centre will be located at the agency's St. Denis headquarters. Apart from coordinating logistics, the centre will hold a daily debriefing call with the Quebec health minister's team at 4 p.m., and also a daily conference call with every health centre, doctors' clinics and hospitals, Massicotte added.</p>
<p>In the Quebec National Assembly, Health Minister Yves Bolduc said Quebec has 11 million doses of Tamiflu and other antivirals used to treat influenza, but the minister said the situation in the province now is "stable."</p>
<p>Two suspected cases of H1N1 infection turned out not to be swine flu and no cases were reported yesterday.</p>
<p>He added that Mexican seasonal farm workers must have medical examinations before they leave their country and if they do have symptoms after they arrive here, they will be cared for "very quickly."</p>
<p>Quebec farms bring in about 6,000 seasonal workers each year, about 3,000 of them from Mexico.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'Swine flu' a bad name, U.S. says</b>
</div><div>AFP</div>

</p>
<p>United States government officials said yesterday they were reviewing whether to change the name of the "swine flu" outbreak, complaining that a slew of countries were misguidedly banning pork exports from North America.</p>
<p>"This is not a food-borne crisis. It's important to not refer to swine flu. It's important to convey the message that consuming pork will not cause this illness," Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters.</p>
<p>"We're concerned about safety, but also about the impact on the economy."</p>
<p>The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention echoed the message that there is no risk from eating pork, but there is every risk of human-to-human transmission.</p>
<p>"In the public, we've been seeing a fair amount of misconception," said Richard Besser, the CDC's acting director, stressing that pigs were the origin of only one component of the flu strain now afflicting people worldwide. "That's not helpful to pork producers, that's not helpful to people who eat pork. It's not helpful to people who are wondering how they can get this infection," he said.</p>
<p>"So we're discussing if there's a better to way to describe this that would not lead to inappropriate actions on people's part."</p>
<p>Russia widened a ban on imports of U.S. meat products to cover pork shipments from 14 states.</p>
<p>Ecuador imposed its own ban on pork imports from Mexico and the U.S., joining other countries that have imposed restrictions, including China, Thailand, Indonesia and several Balkan nations.</p>
<p>CDC researchers have identified the strain as one of the H1N1 family of influenza viruses - a microbe built from strains circulating among humans, birds and pigs, and whose origins span three continents.</p>

</p>
<p>Good growing weather in Florida has produced a variety of vegetables in good condition in our stores. String beans are extra-plentiful. Cucumbers, bell peppers, celery, corn and lettuce are all in abundance. New potatoes and the first Florida watermelons are other imports from that state.</p>
<p>California is picking up steam after a hot spell ripened some of our basic imports - broccoli, cauliflower and lettuce - so quickly, they were light in weight. It's cooled off since on the West Coast, so supplies are returning to normal.</p>
<p>The first New Jersey asparagus has arrived, and is selling alongside the West Coast crop. Strawberries are a staple of Mother's Day celebrations and so, with California supplying the entire continent currently, shoppers may see higher prices over the next couple of weeks. Grapes from Chile are in their final phase, but Mexican grapes will be along soon.</p>
<p>A considerable number of Mexican-grown foods are in town, but because they are transported into the U.S. for packing, they are not always labelled as Mexican produce. There is no link between fresh produce and the outbreak of swine flu in Mexico, so shop freely for such foods as tomatoes, peppers, zucchini, eggplant, onions and watermelon, to name some of the Mexican foods currently in town.</p>

<p>Golf - At least 10 golfers have withdrawn from the San Luis Potosi Open in Mexico due to mounting concern over the swine flu outbreak, the Canadian Golf Tour said Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We are taking every precaution with our players at San Luis Potosi and will watch the situation closely," said commissioner Richard Janes on the Canadian Tour website.</p>
<p>The Canadian Tour has closed the Jack Nicklaus-designed La Loma Golf Club layout to the public and no fans or local caddies will be attending.</p>
<p>Other precautions include using bottled water and hand sanitizers and a recommendation that players eat at the resort and not travel into the town of San Luis Potosi.</p>

<p>Movies - A mutant superhero is no match for the swine flu that has killed up to 149 people in Mexico.</p>
<p>Hollywood movie studio 20th Century-Fox said Monday it was scrapping plans to release X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the first big movie of the summer, in Mexico this weekend.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>.-owned studio said the Hugh Jackman action movie would probably be delayed by a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The outbreak has forced Mexico's top movie-theatre chains to shut down dozens of cinemas throughout the nation's capital, part of a push by authorities to limit large public gatherings that could facilitate the spread of the disease.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pork bans concern alberta producers</b>
</div><div>Gina Teel   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald; with files from Canwest News Service</div>
<div>546 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Alberta pork producers are concerned over the potential for countries to ban their product, now that two cases of human swine influenza have been confirmed in the province.</p>
<p>The worries come as China, Russia and a number of other countries have banned U. S. pork amid swine flu fears, even though there's no evidence the U. S. swine herd is infected with the virus, never mind that swine influenza viruses aren't transmitted by food, so eating pork is safe.</p>
<p>Paul Hodgman, executive director of Alberta Pork, said the bans fly in the face of some key facts: namely that the swine flu virus is in humans and isn't an animal health or food safety issue.</p>
<p>"What I'm concerned about is a government or people in other countries saying they don't want any product coming from countries that have it (human form), and treating it as a food safety issue," he said.</p>
<p>Hogs are Alberta's fifth-largest agrifood export, valued at $346-million annually.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, six countries were confirmed as banning U. S. pork and pork products, "a shorter list than the ones that are rumoured to be," said U. S. Meat Export Federation spokesman Jim Herlihy.</p>
<p>This is even as U. S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack reiterated to trading partners that the discovery of the H1N1 flu virus is in humans, and that any trade restrictions would be inconsistent with World Organization for Animal Health guidelines.</p>
<p>Public health concerns over the swine flu outbreak, which has killed 152 people in Mexico and sickened dozens of others in 19 countries, have generated fears worldwide.</p>
<p>Those fears have also whacked major indexes around the world, including the Toronto Stock Exchange, which tumbled for the second day in a row Tuesday.The S&P/TSX composite index gave up 46.77 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 9,348.03.</p>
<p>Travel-related stocks continued to suffer: Air Canada was down 1.25 per cent, <span class="companylink">Transat A. T. Inc</span>. lost 1.3 per cent, but <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. was unchanged.</p>
<p>The turmoil comes as the Public Health Agency of Canada has cautioned travellers to avoid "elective or non-essential" travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>Transat has suspended flights from Canada to Mexico through to June 1, while WestJet and WestJet Vacations will cease service to Cancun, Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan, and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, effective May 4.</p>
<p>Air Canada and Air Canada Vacations will suspend all operations to Cancun, Cozumel and Puerto Vallarta until June 1. Flights to Mexico City will be maintained.</p>
<p>Swine flu concerns have also impacted the price of commodities.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hog futures for June delivery closed down 3.42 per cent.</p>
<p>On Monday, June and July contracts finished limit down, and that's got Acme hog producer Alfred Neufeld upset. Even corn went down on swine flu fears, which he said shows just how reactionary the markets are.</p>
<p>"For markets to react like that in the name of a flu that has nothing to do with pigs, or supply and demand," is unbelievable, said Neufeld, who markets about 16,000 hogs annually.</p>

</div><div>Eva Ferguson   </div>

</p>
<p>Two years ago, while vacationing in the Mayan Riviera, Matt Lewis and Jodi Threlfall agreed there was no better sandy beach to exchange their wedding vows.</p>
<p>Nearly every day since their engagement 14 months ago has been spent finalizing the details of their destination wedding -- scheduled for next week in Mexico.The photographer is booked, the cake's been ordered and the marriage licence is waiting to be picked up.</p>
<p>But the international spread of the swine flu has led their airline to cancel the flight, leaving the couple scrambling to make new plans.</p>
<p>"It was our dream wedding," said Lewis, 28, adding 40 guests were expected to leave Friday, for the Wednesday nuptials. The travel agency is now trying to find another destination, he said.</p>
<p>"At this point we'd be happy just to find somewhere sunny and hot, and still get married on the day we planned," said Lewis, adding he thinks the airlines are overreacting.</p>
<p>"But we don't want anyone to get sick either, so this is the safest thing to do."</p>
<p><span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines</span> and Air Canada joined several carriers in suspending flights to destinations in Mexico due to the flu scare.</p>
<p>"What's most important to us is the safety and well-being of our guests so we have suspended flights until this situation is resolved," said Robert Palmer, a spokesman for WestJet.</p>
<p>WestJet and WestJet Vacations will cease service to Cancun, Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan, and Puerto Vallarta as of Monday, said Palmer, adding the company is trying to reach customers in Mexico to have them reschedule return trips.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Air Transat</span>, Nolitours and Transat Holidays also suspended all travel to Mexico, while Carnival Cruise Lines cancelled port stops there as the outbreak climbed to more than 150 deaths.</p>
<p>Laurie Keith, honeymoon and destination specialist with Romantic Planet Vacations Inc., says Lewis's wedding is one of three she has booked in the Mayan Riviera for the next 10 days. Guests are scheduled to fly in from all over North America and Europe. Caterers have been booked, cakes ordered, and complex legal requirements have been met, she said. "It's really hard to re-organize all of that to another destination,"Keith said.</p>
<p>Travel agencies continued to be inundated Tuesday with calls from travellers looking to cancel or reschedule vacations over concerns about swine flu after the Canadian government issued an advisory against all non-essential travel to Mexico and several airlines cancelled flights to the sunny destination.</p>
<p>"There's a fear of the unknown and, until the World Health Organization can contain this virus, and verify the breadth of it, people will continue to fear travel to Mexico," said Allison Wallace, spokeswoman for Flight Centre, a travel agent with 130 stores across Canada.</p>

<p>With the swine flu outbreak gaining steam and reported cases of infection rising, a recruiter of Mexican workers to Canada isn't taking any chances.</p>
<p>Mexi-Can Labour Force will be taking workers they've recruited to Alberta for a checkup at the doctor once they arrive in this province.</p>
<p>"Like anybody, we're concerned. We want to be careful," said Lyle Tomie, managing director of Mexi-Can, which helps bring 500 to 1,000 Mexican workers to Alberta every year. "We don't want to bring someone up here that's got the deadly strain of this virus."</p>
<p>On Monday, federal Immigration Minister Jason Kenney announced Mexican workers heading to Canada must now receive a physical exam and be tested for fever before they depart.</p>
<p>Tomie says the Canadian government has a good handle on the situation, and he has no problem if there are delays bringing Mexican workers to Canada. "Nobody in the whole immigration game would want to bring somebody in here that's infected," he said.</p>
<p>There were more than 4,300 temporary foreign workers from Mexico in Alberta, as of Dec. 1, 2008, according to Citizenship and Immigration Canada statistics. About 1,000 of those were seasonal agricultural workers.</p>
<p>Calgary immigration lawyer Michael Greene said it's more likely Canadian tourists will bring back the virus than Mexican workers arriving:" The Canadian tourists are not required to go through an immigration medical, and there's far more of them."</p>
<p>Mexicans planning to work more than six months in Canada must go through a medical assessment, he said. Greene also said due to the economic downturn, there are far fewer temporary foreign workers from Mexico heading to Canada.</p>
<p>The province isn't taking any measures beyond those announced by the federal government to scrutinize the health of Mexican workers coming to Alberta, said Jan-ice Schroeder, spokeswoman with Alberta Employment and Immigration.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some seasonal workers from Mexico who are in Alberta are very worried about the virus outbreak in their home country.</p>
<p>Brothers-in-law Victor Rebolla Mora and Antonio Montoya Mora</p>
<p>arrived in March to work at Hotchkiss Herbs and Produce, a farm southeast of Calgary. They are from a small town three hours northwest of Mexico City.Although the outbreak has not struck their community,</p>
<p>the men are telling their families not to go outside and breathe the air for fear they will be contaminated by the virus, according to Tracy Hotchkiss, co-owner of the farm.</p>
<p>"Victor says that he's concerned for his family and his community because there's just no medication that would be able to deal with this at this point,"Hotchkiss said.</p>
<p>HeatherGlen golf course in Calgary is awaiting two more workers from Mexico. Slade King, the director of golf, said with the outbreak of swine flu, he's unsure if the workers will be approved or delayed in their travel. Eight Mexican workers arrived at HeatherGlen a month ago, before swine flu was an issue. Now, King said, the virus "definitely is a concern.</p>
<p>"We do have a few more (Mexican workers) that are in the approval process, two more I believe, that could definitely get affected by this," he said.</p>

<p>Calgarians living in Mexico are taking precautions to avoid potentially deadly swine flu, but for some, it's more of a "hands off" approach.</p>
<p>"It's Mexican custom you hug people. Now you think if you do, you might get it. It's difficult to break that habit, or to not shake hands," said Herman Heynen, a former Okotoks resident living as a local in Mazatlan.</p>
<p>Life goes on in Mexico's largest commercial port. Heynen says he checks the local news as often as he can for updates to see if the tourism mecca, beaches teeming with resort hotels, has identified any local victims of the potentially deadly flu.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of April, hundreds of cases of the mysterious illness-- which produces severe respiratory symptoms and is mostly affecting people between the ages of 25 and 44 --have surfaced in clusters in Mexico City, Oaxaca and San Luis Potosi.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level Monday amid a world-wide battle against the swine-flu outbreak,</p>
<p>Until there is more information, Heynen says "I'll just be more careful in public places. I'm not a movie goer, there's less people in the grocery store if you go early in the morning."</p>
<p>Former Calgarians Bill and Sally Babione, now living in Mazatlan, said they learned an important lesson after the deadly SARS outbreak in the spring of 2003.</p>
<p>"We wash our hands every time we come in the door, and that's something we've done for the last five years, that's nothing new. It's a natural precaution," he said.</p>
<p>"I think we've seen four people actually wearing face masks. It seems all the masks have gone to Mexico City,"he added.</p>
<p>"The Mexican government has some pretty drastic measures in place to stop the spread. They've shut down the schools, and I applaud it."</p>
<p>Cruise ships, which usually dock in the thriving commercial seaport of Mazatlan, appear to be bypassing Mexico, he said.</p>
<p>"On Tuesday, there's usually one or two in. There were none today, we're told there's not going to be any for a couple of weeks."</p>

</p>
<p>The health system's answer to swine flu, it seems, is to keep people away from the health system. Alberta authorities want you to wait it out at home.</p>
<p>That seems like odd advice for handling a new flu outbreak. In a serious pandemic, it could get you dead.</p>
<p>So you have to wonder if the experts think this is a real porcine panic. or just a half-baked Hamageddon.</p>
<p>Here's a hint from Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's new chief medical officer of health: "We recommend anyone with a fever or cough who has returned from a recent trip to Mexico to recover from their illness at home, and call Health-Link Alberta before seeking medical attention."</p>
<p>Yes, people just back from virus central are supposed to self-diagnose before seeking help. Without doubt, the authorities are trying to keep the pressure off the hospitals. But the ad-vice would surely be more urgent in the face of a real crisis. The uproar is already being likened to the great 1976 swine flu panic that never got out of the barn.</p>
<p>The Boar Horsemen of the Aporkalypse rode wild for months, but most U. S. victims were killed by the vaccine ordered by then-president Gerald Ford.</p>
<p>Dr. Corriveau certainly sounds hopeful this new swine flu isn't a powerful scourge--not yet, anyway. Every Canadian case so far has ended in full recovery.</p>
<p>In a long Tuesday of local and national news conferences, our local doc said the most intriguing thing of all.</p>
<p>He noted only 25 deaths in Mexico have been officially linked to swine flu--even though the "official" total, bandied about everywhere, is nearly 150. Corriveau said the extra fatalities may be from other causes, including a serious earlier outbreak of a typeBflu.</p>
<p>It's tough to get a grip on the situation in Mexico because of poor monitoring and testing. That's why Canada sent people down there--to find out what's going on. And one finding, it seems, is that the new flu bug might not be extremely serious even in Mexico.</p>
<p>When we switch over to Dr. Butler Jones, Corriveau's federal counterpart, the story sounds a bit more grim, but not by much. He expects some Canadians will die, as vulnerable people always do from any sort of flu (up to 300 every year in Alberta from routine outbreaks that never cause panic.)</p>
<p>Jones also notes, however, that a new virus always has potential to switch tactics and become deadly. He finds himself "humbled" before the adaptive power of a virus.</p>
<p>Then again, a virus that has just switched from animals to humans is equally likely to fade away.</p>
<p>It's not so easy working with a new host, apparently. In effect, the virus says-- "You're not a pig? Disgusting!"-- and gives up.</p>
<p>You might call this silly journalistic anthropomorphizing. You might be right.</p>
<p>But the public health doctors do the same thing. They talk about how the virus "behaves" or "acts" or "modifies its behaviour."</p>
<p>They seem to see it as a vast swarm with a kind of group intelligence, like an invisible ant colony.</p>
<p>So far, this swarm is acting pretty much like its earlier cousins. It's not to be trifled with--not at all--but it's a long way from Aporkalypse Now.</p>

<p>Let's set the record straight about swine flu.</p>
<p>You can't contract it from eating pork chops; it's unlikely for average Calgarians to become ill; and wearing a surgical mask won't help protect you against the flu. read on for more information about these truths and others. - The most common way to get swine flu is through direct contact with pigs, according to the world Health organization--not person to person. some human-to-human transmission has been reported, but that's been "limited to close contacts and closed groups of people."</p>
<p>Swine flu passes between people like other respiratory illnesses--when germs find their way to the nose and/or throat.</p>
<p>The Public Health agency of Canada says germs can be breathed in or picked up from hard surfaces, such as doorknobs, phones and counters. - Even if you have recently returned from mexico, don't stress. People who have travelled to mexico and are feeling fine should not worry.</p>
<p>Alberta Health officials say they are only concerned about albertans who have recently returned from mexico and are feeling ill.</p>
<p>Anyone who is sick and has recently been to mexico --or individuals who are ill and have been in contact with travellers who were in mexico--should call their doctor's office or Healthlink (at 1-866-408-5465).</p>
<p>If you're not feeling sick and are looking for information regarding the outbreak, alberta Health asks you visit its website, health. alberta.ca, instead of calling.</p>

<p>Olympic diving champion Matthew Mitcham has been ordered to return from Mexico by his Australian provincial sports institute over concerns about swine flu.</p>
<p>Mitcham and his Australian teammate Alexandra Croak competed at a World Diving Series meet in Mexico City last weekend and then returned to training camp at the coastal town of Veracruz.</p>
<p>Mitcham, who has been in Mexico for more than two weeks, told <span class="companylink">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</span> radio on Wednesday he had concerns about being on a long-haul flight in confined conditions with people possibly infected with the flu.</p>
<p>"I am more concerned boarding a plane than I am staying here," he said, adding that the New South Wales Institute of Sports was investigating departure flights for him which avoided Mexico City, where many fatalities have occurred.</p>
<p>Mitcham scored four perfect 10s on his final dive to win the 10-metre platform at the Beijing Olympics last August.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Golfers calculate risk of playing in Mexico; Canadian Tour opts to reschedule two tournaments to later in season</b>
</div><div>John Korobanik   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>970 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>C2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>

<p>It was largely a question of risk versus reward and Stuart Anderson figured the risk was worth it when he elected to stay in Mexico this week to play in the Canadian Tour's $125,000 San Luis Potosi Open despite the growing swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>For Barrett Jarosch, the risk wasn't worth the possible reward.</p>
<p>"For me, it's worth it," said Anderson, a native of Edmonton now living in Victoria.</p>
<p>"I'm fifth on the money list and staying in that top five is very crucial, after Winnipeg and the Canadian swing, because the top five guys get into the Canadian Open.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be down here if I didn't feel safe. The golf comes second to health, but I feel healthy and I think we're going to be alright." Anderson has won $15,412 through the first four events and has a narrow lead of less than $200 over American Mike Grube as they chase the critical fifth place on the Order of Merit.</p>
<p>The Tour was scheduled to remain in Mexico after San Luis Potosi but the next two events -- the Yucatan Country Club Classic and the Iberostar Riviera Maya Open -- are being rescheduled and will take place in consecutive weeks on the 2009 schedule.</p>
<p>"With the heightened alerts in Mexico, we have taken the precaution of protecting the health and safety of our members," said commissioner Richard Janes, who explained that the San Luis Potosi event will take place as scheduled unless "circumstances change." "The Iberostar Resort and the Merida airport will be shut down as a safeguard and the Canadian Tour is making the necessary arrangements with its travel partners to bring our players home," James added.</p>
<p>Among the precautions are using bottled water only, hand sanitizers on every hole, and having the Tour players take their meals at either the hotel or San Luis Potosi Resort. The Tour players and officials have also been supplied with masks, but few are using them right now because their time is spent at the secluded five-star hotel and in the open air of the golf course.</p>
<p>The Canadian swing is next up on the Tour, starting with Victoria and including the Telus Edmonton Open from June 29-July 5. After the Players Cup in Winnipeg from July 13-18, the top five money- winners get invites to the Canadian Open beginning July 20.</p>
<p>Jarosch isn't in that fight for the top five at the moment and, for him, the decision to come home was pretty easy, especially when two of his travelling companions decided they were leaving Mexico.</p>
<p>"I started thinking, these tournaments down here are not that big a deal in the big scheme of things," Jarosch said. "So why are you even thinking of taking a chance? Since I've been back, and it's been getting a little worse and a little worse, I'm a lot more comfortable that I came back. If this gets a little worse, would they even let you fly out of Mexico?" Speaking on his cellphone between shots of Tuesday's pro-am, Anderson said the fear of swine flu, which has spread into the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia, hasn't changed their golf routine.</p>
<p>"Wake up in the morning, get showered, go to the golf course and eat. Away from golf, the hardest thing is you're not able to travel and see the city because they have us kind of locked down, travelling to and from the hotel, eating at the hotel and golf course only. The whole venture of being a tourist during the week is gone." The closest they'll get to the historic town of San Luis Potosi is to look at it from the Jack Nicklaus-designed La Loma Golf Club, a striking par-72 layout that sits at 1,800 metres above sea level and overlooks the city.</p>
<p>Before hitting his first shot on the third hole of the pro-am, Anderson said the event is being played with no local caddies and no spectators. The only people on the course are the golfers and officials, and that means the players will be carrying their own clubs.</p>
<p>"It's a difficult walking course in the mountains with hills. We're at a high elevation of 6,100 feet," he said. "It will be difficult. We're going to have one golf cart per group. We're all going to throw our clubs on it and alternate driving every six holes. Eventually, we'll be walking 12 holes and driving six holes." Nearly 20 players have withdrawn and left Mexico.</p>
<p>Jarosch said whether it was a good decision to play in Mexico won't be known "until someone gets sick or something goes bad. If no one gets sick and everyone is fine and they're able to fly out after the last tournament is done, then it will look like they made the right decision." For Jarosch, a "probably be alright" wasn't enough, especially given that he falls in the target age group of 16- to 40-year-olds.</p>
<p>"It's not that big of a loss," he said of missing the Mexican tournaments. "All you really need, if you have two top 10s the rest of the way, you'll secure your card. If you finish 20th, or if you finish third on the money list, you're not really getting any benefits, playing-wise."</p>
