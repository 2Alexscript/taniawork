<p>Ottawa --</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper departed this morning for a whirlwind summit with his North American counterparts in Mexico's second biggest city, a get-together that's been strained by Canada's surprise decision to slap travel restrictions on Mexicans.</p>
<p>The prime minister's jet left Ottawa about 10 a.m. ET and is expected to arrive mid-afternoon in Guadalajara, a populous city that's known as Mexicon's Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The weather is forecast to be a balmy 27 degrees, but Mr. Harper may feel a slight nip in the air as he arrives for the annual Three Amigos gathering.</p>
<p>The prime minister is meeting Mexican President Felipe Calderon in a one-to-one for the first time since since imposing visa requirements on Mexicans intending to visit Canada. That rule went into effect last month and has angered Mexico.</p>
<p>Mr. Harper's likely to get a cool reception, particularly after the Prime Minister's Office signalled Friday it has no intention of lifting visa requirements _ or even promising to do so _ during the summit.</p>
<p>Mexican concerns – from the visa flap to Mr. Calderon's prolonged and bloody war against drug cartels – are likely to loom large at a summit where Canada's biggest demand is also likely to go unfulfilled. Ottawa will press U.S. President Barack Obama for an exemption from protectionist “Buy America” procurement policies but Canadian officials are playing down the chances of a breakthrough.</p>
<p>The annual Three Amigos meeting itself – only five years old – is showing signs of fading in importance. It's jettisoned an ambitious set of three-way talks adopted during U.S. president George W. Bush's term in office to advance economic and security integration of North American. This much-ballyhooed Security and Prosperity Partnership is missing from the agenda, as are the senior North American business executives that had been invited to the past two summits to help steer discussions.</p>
<p>Unlike Mexico, Canada won't even get a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Obama during the Guadalajara summit. Mr. Harper will have to wait until Sept. 16 for a tête-à-tête at the White House.</p>
<p>Michael Hart, a former Canadian trade negotiator who teaches at Carleton University, calls the summits irrelevant. “We have an intense, complicated relationship with the United States. We do not with the Mexicans. The Mexicans have an intense complicated relationships with the U.S. They do not with Canada.”</p>
<p>Derek Burney, a former Canadian ambassador to Washington, said the trilateral talks in and of themselves haven't generated much in the way of substance over the years.</p>
<p>“When you get into a trilateral setting you're dealing with low-common-denominator commonality and you're evading some of the harder bilateral issues that need to be addressed.”</p>
<p>Champions of the trilateral approach, including Canadian Council of Chief Executives CEO Thomas d'Aquino, say the meetings still give prime ministers valuable face time with the U.S. president.</p>
<p>Colin Robertson, a veteran diplomat and fellow at Carleton University, agrees. “Don't discount the importance of proximity,” he said. He warned Canadians not to underestimate the increasing importance that Mexico is taking on in the minds of Americans because of Latino immigration and power and population shifts to the U.S. South.</p>
<p>“If we don't factor in Mexico, which is sometimes the temptation, then we play at a disadvantage.”</p>
<p>The NAFTA leaders will use several hours of joint face time in Guadalajara to prepare for the September Group-of-20 economic summit, to talk about a feared fall resurgence of the swine flu virus, and to discuss how to fight climate change in a way that doesn't leave them offside with the United States.</p>
<p>But Canadian officials already appear to be looking to the Sept. 16 meeting between Mr. Harper and Mr. Obama as more important than the Guadalajara summit for addressing pressing issues. The Prime Minister's Office made a point of announcing the September White House get-together during a press briefing yesterday on the North American Leader's Summit.</p>
<p>After the Three Amigos meeting concludes Monday, Mr. Harper will head to Panama where he is expected to sign a free-trade deal with the Central American country.</p>

</p>
<p>Edmonton - Brooke VanAssen can't do many of the things other kids her age take for granted: scrub her teeth, roughhouse, gnaw at the inside of her cheek or absentmindedly pick her nose, as all children do but never admit.</p>
<p>These things put her at risk of hemorrhaging.</p>
<p>Under the apple of her left cheek is a tangled mass of abnormal blood vessels fed by Brooke's carotid artery. If Brooke was hit by a baseball, fell off her bike or sneezed violently, the mass of veins and arteries swelling her face could burst.</p>
<p>Brooke, 9, has an arteriovenous malformation in her face. It is a rare congenital disorder that affects less than one per cent of the population.</p>
<p>Treatments haven't worked.</p>
<p>In the past two years, the gnarled mass has tripled in size and fills 70 per cent of her sinuses. The bone under her last two teeth has been worn away by the pulsating balloon of blood flow, much like a rock is worn away by rushing streams.</p>
<p>Her parents will soon face bills of more than $120,000 U.S. for hospital and medical fees so that Brooke can get specialized treatment from an American doctor who says he can cure the young girl.</p>
<p>They flew to Denver for the first of several treatments after the Alberta government denied funding for the out-of-country trips, saying comparable treatment was available in Canada. Jodi and Rob VanAssen disagree and will be taking Brooke to the U.S. for at least three more appointments at $35,000 to $40,000 each time.</p>
<p>"Brooke's worth that kind of money," said Rob VanAssen, Brooke's father. "We had to do it and we can't afford it ourselves, but we trust and know the Lord is in charge of all things."</p>
<p>Jodi VanAssen, Brooke's mother, said, "The power of prayer has been awesome."</p>
<p>While both are angry with the government's decision to turn down their funding request - they have appealed the decision and expect to hear back early this month - they are turning toward their small farming and church community for financial and emotional help.</p>
<p>The VanAssens, who have six children, haven't made a profit on their pig farm for the past three years. Hog prices recently fell, hit hard by the fear surrounding the H1N1 virus, originally called swine flu.</p>
<p>Now, on top of a struggling farm, they have a daughter who wanders upstairs during the night, crying because she's had nightmares about losing her face and worried about the money it will take to fix it.</p>
<p>"How do you comprehend that as a 9-year-old?" Rob asked.</p>
<p>The couple may consider taking out a loan to help pay the medical bills, but members of the Canadian Reformed Church in their small farming community of Neerlandia, Alta., set up a trust fund for donations. Brooke's school held a barbecue, and an Edmonton church held a garage sale. A bucket for donations was set up at the farmers market in nearby Barrhead. Strangers from Westlock have even driven to Brooke's home to drop off money.</p>
<p>Enough has been raised to cover Brooke's first two medical visits.</p>
<p>"It gives us confidence that people believe in the decision we've made," Jodi said. "But ultimately, we know it can't last."</p>
<p>The problems started two years ago when Brooke began waking up each morning with a pool of blood on her pillow. Doctors made various diagnoses: an infection, a rare but severe bacteria treated with strong antibiotics, a birthmark in her cheek.</p>
<p>Then, on Valentine's Day 2007, Brooke almost bled to death when an Edmonton dentist extracted a molar, thinking there was something beneath the tooth.</p>
<p>She fainted in her father's arms and was taken by ambulance to the Stollery Children's Hospital where she received a blood transfusion.</p>
<p>Eventually, doctors diagnosed an AVM, or arteriovenous malformation, in her cheek. Some AVMs go unnoticed or can be safely cut out, although there is no guarantee they won't grow back. They can occur all over the body; in the lungs or heart, on feet or fingers, even the brain, where bleeding can lead to a stroke.</p>
<p>With Brooke's condition, the lesions are present at birth, created in the womb when more "primitive" blood vessels are supposed to be reabsorbed by the fetus and replaced by more mature blood vessels. This reabsorption doesn't happen in some babies, leaving these abnormal vessels to grow into knots.</p>
<p>In Brooke's case, cutting out the AVM isn't an option.</p>
<p>"If you have to live without a jaw bone, it's not so easy," said Dr. Lyle McGonigle, Brooke's pediatrician. "It's a difficult thing to treat and it's a bad AVM. It's in a bad place and it's difficult to get at. It has lots of feeding vessels. I think it's pretty dangerous,"especially as Brooke begins losing her baby teeth.</p>
<p>Doctors in Edmonton began treating her with embolization, using glue to create clots in the blood vessels. The work is complex and comes with some risk. If the wrong vessels are plugged, blood could stop feeding Brooke's nose, eye or cheekbone, potentially killing the tissue and parts of Brooke's face.</p>
<p>"It's probably been somewhat effective, but not very effective," McGonigle said of Brooke's early treatments. "In Brooke's case, it's hard to know what the right therapy is. I can tell you she needs therapy and she needs aggressive therapy."</p>
<p>McGonigle wrote an official letter to the province's Out of Country Health Services Committee, requesting funding coverage for the VanAssens to send Brooke to the U.S. for a different type of embolization therapy by Dr. Wayne Yakes. McGonigle said he isn't convinced the U.S.-based therapy is more beneficial to Brooke, but believes the government should financially support the parents' decision.</p>
<p>"Dr. Yakes is very aggressive in attempting to clot off AVMs and he does it with a technique that is not universally accepted and has high risks and high side effects," McGonigle said. "(Brooke) needs treatment and she needs aggressive treatment and the parents have decided that's the treatment they want after studying the available information to them. I think that is therapy we probably should be paying for her."</p>
<p>Yakes, who invented a different embolization process in 1983 and established Colorado's Vascular Malformation Centre in 1991, said his treatment is the only curative, rather than palliative, one.</p>
<p>He said plugging the vessels with glue actually spurs new growth because endothelial cells lining the blood vessels sense decreased oxygen and seek to fix the problem by causing white blood cells to rush to the blocked sites to carry out the glue particles. The endothelial cells also spark the growth of new blood vessels to the area and stimulate the AVM.</p>
<p>Yakes said the glue treatment must be done over and over again without any definitive cure.</p>
<p>Yakes's treatment uses alcohol to destroy the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels in the AVM. When the endothelial cells die and peel off the vessel walls, platelets rush to patch the sites. They clump together and clot the blood flow permanently, Yakes said. He, too, must be careful not to block crucial blood flow to parts of Brooke's face.</p>
<p>"It's not experimental at all," Yakes said. "It's been proven in literature on every continent."</p>
<p>Yakes said 80 per cent of the cases he treats with alcohol are cured. He sees about 1,000 patients each year from around the world, and helped train doctors in Cairo, London, Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Europe. He's currently working with experts from the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>He said Brooke's treatment is going well so far.</p>
<p>"She is such a tough little kid," he said in a telephone interview. He is also helping the VanAssens by providing multiple treatments at each visit, but only charging for one. "We're unfortunate that the (Alberta) government refused to do anything to help and they count their health-care services the best in the world. Denying this child, I think that's unconscionable."</p>
<p>John Tuckwell, spokesman for Alberta Health, said he can't comment on Brooke's case, but said the committee that looks at applications for out-of-country health care makes its decisions based solely on medical advice. The committee isn't even told how much the treatments cost.</p>
<p>Tuckwell said the committee tries to determine if the treatment is available elsewhere in Canada rather than another country.</p>
<p>In its letter to the VanAssens, the committee said it denied funding because embolization treatment with glue is available in Alberta and Toronto, even though "it may not be the technique and/or particular treatment the parent prefers."</p>
<p>Rob and Jodi VanAssen said their decision has nothing to do with preference, but is necessary for their daughter.</p>
<p>"We are upset. We are very disappointed," Rob said. "The minister of health is putting a stranglehold on our health-care system."</p>
<p>"It's not about preference. It's about a cure," Jodi said. "To them, our daughter is a number with a big dollar sign beside her name. But she's our daughter. How can you say a life isn't important?"</p>

</p>
<p>When Stephen Harper, Barack Obama and Felipe Calderon, the "three amigos" leading Canada, the United States and Mexico, saddle up for their summit in Guadalajara today and tomorrow, they will gallop through an agenda that has seldom been more rugged. From trade protectionism to climate change, swine flu and immigration issues, there will be scant time in the two-day meeting to pause for breath.</p>
<p>But there's likely to be a glaring omission, one that is a matter of life and death. It's the "iron river" of smuggled guns flowing from the U.S. to both Canada and Mexico, and leaving destruction in its wake.</p>
<p>Mexico's ambassador to Washington has accused the U.S. of fuelling drug-related violence in which some 6,000 people have died in the past year alone. He said there was a "direct correlation" between the overturning of a 2004 U.S. law banning assault weapons and Mexico's upswing in seizures of those guns on its own turf.</p>
<p>Toronto, where five people were shot on a single night last week, needs few reminders of the harm that smuggled weapons cause. In 2006, Toronto police tracked 120 of 181 guns used in crimes back to the U.S. A recent study by three international researchers suggested that two-thirds of criminally used guns seized across Canada have American origins. And last year, more than 500 restricted and prohibited weapons were confiscated by Canadian border security officials, a figure they say is only 3 per cent of the total smuggled into the country.</p>
<p>During the pro-gun Bush administration, there was little hope of convincing Washington to come to grips with the problem. Ironically, while President George W. Bush called for tighter border controls to fend off would-be Canadian terrorists, he had no evidence that the hypothetical terrorists had killed any Americans. Meanwhile, illegally-smuggled U.S. guns were demonstrably injuring Canadians.</p>
<p>Obama has opened the door to a dialogue on gun control. Shortly after his inauguration, he pushed for restoring the assault weapons ban, a move Attorney General Eric Holder said would benefit Mexico. Opposition in Congress has put a damper on the plan.</p>
<p>Harper should take the opportunity of this summit to point out that tighter U.S. controls, including enforcement of existing laws, would also benefit Canadians by keeping guns from the hands of violent gangs in our cities. Such a stand may seem unlikely for our Prime Minister, given his push to eliminate the long gun registry and his cordial relationship with anti-gun control folks.</p>
<p>But Harper has also billed himself as tough on crime. He could live up to his own billing by raising this issue with Obama in Guadalajara.</p>

</p>
<p>Guadalajara, Mexico --</p>
<p>Canada is deploying more Mounties to help train Mexican police waging a bloody and difficult battle against homegrown drug lords, a measure the Tories unveiled before a meeting between Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his Mexican counterpart Sunday in hopes of deflecting attention from the frosty state of relations between the two NAFTA nations.</p>
<p>Mr. Harper, U.S. President Barack Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calderon begin their two-day North American Leaders' Summit in Guadalajara Sunday, but the goodwill at this year's Three Amigos meeting has been strained by Canada's surprise decision to slap travel restrictions on Mexicans last month.</p>
<p>The weather hit a balmy 27 degrees Sunday in Guadalajara, which is known as Mexico's Silicon Valley, but Mr. Harper is getting a cool reception as he meets with Mr. Calderon for the first time since imposing visa requirements on Mexicans intending to travel to Canada. This rule went into effect last month and has greatly angered Mexico.</p>
<p>Mr. Harper's Conservative government timed a news announcement of this police aid for Mexico to coincide with his plane's landing in Guadalajara – hours before the Prime Minister met with Mr. Calderon and faced pleas to lift the visa rule.</p>
<p>Mexico has been plagued with rising drug-related violence in recent years as rival drug cartels battle each other for control of smuggling and distribution routes. These cartels are a growing force in international organized crime which is focused on controlling channels into places such as the United States, a major market for illegal narcotics.</p>
<p>Canada is tapping a $15-million fund set aside in the 2009 budget – but not spent – to allocate between $400,000 and $500,000 training more than 330 Mexican police officers and their commanders. Subjects will include fighting money laundering, clandestine tactics, crisis management, intelligence gathering and community policing.</p>
<p>“Our government supports police training in Mexico as part of our common goal of giving police the tools they need to keep drugs off our streets and keep criminals out of our neighbourhoods,” Mr. Harper said Sunday.</p>
<p>About 6,000 people died in drug related violence in Mexico in 2008, nearly double the 3,042 which perished for the same reason a year earlier. Dozens of cartel-related killings continue each month and this year's death toll has already surpassed 4,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Calderon's fight against the drug cartels, a campaign that consumes a lot of energy in his administration, includes pitched battles against the narco-traffickers, who brazenly attack on Mexican authorities. For instance, nine gunmen and three police were killed Friday during a firefight in Mexico's central Hidalgo state. The criminals had opened fire on authorities after they attempted to search their vehicles.</p>
<p>Canada has already sent four Spanish-speaking Royal Canadian Mounted Police instructors to provide basic training to Mexican Federal Police recruits. Another four are scheduled to join them soon.</p>
<p>In addition, Ottawa is now preparing to train 300 mid-level Mexican police offices and bringing 32 commanding officers to Canada this fall for sessions at the Canadian Police College.</p>
<p>Canada is not immune from rising drug violence. Vancouver has seen dozens of drug-gang related killings in the last few years.</p>
<p>Mexican concerns – from the visa flap to Mr. Calderon's prolonged and bloody war against drug cartels – are likely to loom large at a summit where Canada's biggest demand is also likely to go unfulfilled. Ottawa will press Mr. Obama for an exemption from protectionist Buy American procurement policies, but Canadian officials are playing down the chances of a breakthrough.</p>
<p>The annual Three Amigos meeting itself – only five years old – is showing signs of fading in importance. It's jettisoned an ambitious set of three-way talks adopted during former president George W. Bush's term in office to advance the economic and security integration of North America. This much-ballyhooed Security and Prosperity Partnership is missing from the agenda, as are the senior North American business executives that had been invited to the past two summits to help steer discussions.</p>
<p>Unlike Mexico, Canada won't even get a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Obama during the Guadalajara summit. Mr. Harper will have to wait until Sept. 16 (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/harper-to-visit-white-house-next-month/article1244679/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/harper-to-visit-white-house-next-month/article1244679/]) for a tête-à-tête at the White House.</p>
<p>The summits have drawn criticism as irrelevant given that Canada has little in common with Mexico, its second partner in the North American free-trade agreement. Champions of the trilateral approach say regardless of whether Canada and Mexico have much at stake, such gatherings give the Prime Minister valuable face time with the U.S. President.</p>
<p>The NAFTA leaders will use several hours of talks in Guadalajara to prepare for the September Group-of-20 economic summit, to talk about a feared fall resurgence of the swine flu virus, and to discuss how to fight climate change in a way that doesn't leave them offside with the United States.</p>
<p>But Canadian officials already appear to be looking to the Sept. 16 meeting between Mr. Harper and Mr. Obama as more important than the Guadalajara summit for addressing pressing issues. The Prime Minister's Office made a point of announcing the September White House get-together during a press briefing Friday on the North American Leader's Summit.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama is hoping to build a common front with Canada and Mexico as all countries prepare for a key climate change abatement meeting in Copenhagen in December where they will try to find a successor agreement to the Kyoto accord.</p>
<p>A bill before the U.S. Congress calls for greenhouse-gas reductions of 17 per cent below 2005 levels by the year 2020, three percentage points lower than the Canadian target. The U.S. bill would also give subsidies to electricity consumers of coal-fired generating states.</p>
<p>Provinces in Canada, which have jurisdiction over natural resources, are divided on Mr. Obama's plan to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall believes it's worth considering (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/saskatchewan-warms-to-obama-climate-plan/article1244727/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/saskatchewan-warms-to-obama-climate-plan/article1244727/]), and noting it is less stringent than what Ottawa has proposed and eases the burden on the coal industry. Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach said he still has difficulty with the Obama plan, which allows the President to apply penalties at the border for pollution offenders from outside the country.</p>

</p>
<p>Barack Obama can hardly be accused of ignoring his next-door neighbours. So far this year he has held six meetings with Stephen Harper, Canada's prime minister, and five with Mexico's president, Felipe Calderón. The three men will meet once again today for an annual North American summit, this time in Guadalajara, Mexico.</p>
<p>But familiarity does not necessarily imply deep friendship. Intertwined though their economies are through the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico's hopes of forming part of something like the European Union are forlorn. Harper shuns trilateralism, and seems to care only about strengthening Canada's bilateral ties with Washington. And since 2001, the United States has been less interested in integration than in border security.</p>
<p>This year the leaders will talk about their economies' problems. Both Canada and Mexico abhor the "Buy American" clause in Obama's stimulus package. Calderón will press Obama to fulfil his promise earlier this year to restore a pilot scheme allowing Mexican truckers to travel north of the border.</p>
<p>Talk of setting a common position on climate change looks ambitious. The big success has been co-operation on public health. Thanks in part to a committee established at a previous summit, Mexican authorities worked closely with both U.S. and Canadian laboratories to tackle swine flu. Diplomats hope to reinforce this co-operation before the bug's expected resurgence in the autumn.</p>
<p>The meeting may be dominated by the issue of security. On a visit to Mexico in April, Obama accepted that confronting violent drug traffickers was a "shared responsibility." Since then U.S. officials have made bigger efforts to halt the southward flow of guns and money to the drug industry. So far this year they have seized $25.5 million in cash destined for Mexico, almost five times as much as in the same period of 2008. All trains at main border crossings are now inspected. Mexican officials say that intelligence sharing has improved. Friction remains. The release of $100 million in anti-drug aid to Mexico has been slowed by concerns about abuses by the army. But Harper may offer Mexico help in training its police forces.</p>
<p>Calderón is likely to berate Harper over Canada's sudden decision last month to require Mexicans to obtain visas before travelling to the country. This followed a big increase in the number of Mexicans turning up in Canada and claiming to be refugees. Clamping down on abuses in the immigration system is popular in Canada. But in this case it does nothing to boost economic ties and tourism between supposed partners.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper has no plans to reverse the government's decision to impose visas on all Mexican nationals entering Canada, a spokesman for the prime minister said yesterday.</p>
<p>Dimitri Soudas said he "doesn't anticipate" that the government will agree to lift the visas at this weekend's summit in Guadalajara with Mexican President Felipe Calderon and U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Soudas reiterated the government's position that Canada's refugee system has been "overburdened" by refugee claims from Mexico.</p>
<p>Calderon will press Harper to drop the visa restrictions when the two leaders meet this weekend at the Three Amigos summit, Mexican sources say.</p>
<p>Harper travels to Guadalajara on Sunday for a two-day summit with Calderon and Obama. It will be the first Amigos summit, a tradition established by former president George W. Bush, since Obama took office.</p>
<p>But the new visa rules, which require that all Mexican nationals arriving in Canada obtain a visa, threaten to overshadow other areas of possible co-operation between the two countries.</p>
<p>The visa issue, which has incensed Mexican officials and provoked an uproar in the Mexican media, will top Calderon's agenda when he holds his bilateral meeting with Harper, according to a Mexican government source. The Mexican president is expected to propose a number of alternatives, such as enhanced screening by Mexican authorities of travellers to Canada, as well as a crackdown on immigration brokers who urge Mexicans to seek asylum in Canada in exchange for a fee.</p>
<p>Calderon is also expected to encourage Ottawa to share more information on refugee seekers with Mexican officials, who say Canadian authorities have been reluctant to do so, due to privacy concerns.</p>
<p>If Harper stands his ground, as Mexican officials expect, Calderon hasn't ruled out imposing a similar blanket visa requirement on all Canadians travelling to Mexico. Last month, just days after Immigration Minister Jason Kenney announced the visa requirements, Mexico slapped its own visa requirement on Canadian diplomats.</p>
<p>"That's always a possibility," said the Mexican source, when asked if the Calderon government plans further retaliation.</p>
<p>As fellow conservative leaders in a hemisphere where they are becoming increasingly scarce, Harper and Calderon have enjoyed relatively warm relations. But Mexican sources say Calderon has not appreciated the way the Harper government has handled the visa affair.</p>
<p>According to the Mexican source, Calderon called Harper in the spring to thank Canada for its help combating the swine flu outbreak. To Calderon's surprise, the prime minister warned that Canada would soon impose the visa restriction.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the prime minister declined to comment on the visa issue on Thursday.</p>
<p>Ottawa has said the new visa restrictions were necessary to stem the flow of bogus refugee claims from Mexico, which last year accounted for about 9,400 claims, or one-quarter of Canada's total. Only 11 per cent of the Mexican claims were accepted.</p>
<p>But Mexican officials say the universal visa requirement unfairly punishes Mexican tourists, students and entrepreneurs who enter Canada legitimately.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canadian business groups say the new rules have created headaches for industries that regularly employ workers from Mexico, such as the tourism and agriculture sectors.</p>
<p>"It is a significant worry," said Dan Kelly, senior vice-president of legislative affairs for the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents over 100,000 small businesses nationwide.</p>
<p>"I understand why the government felt this was necessary, but we hope this is a very short-term move, and we hope the government will pursue other strategies to address the core problem, which is the refugee system."</p>
<p>Some critics say the visa flap could undermine Ottawa's ability to form a united front with Mexico against U.S. protectionism.</p>
<p>"With his gratuitous shot at Mexico, Prime Minister Harper has complicated an agenda that should have focused on more important issues like Buy American," Liberal trade critic Scott Brison said.</p>

<p>Stephen Colbert, host of Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, noted that Japanese engineers have created a robotic pitcher capable of throwing strikes 90 per cent of the time and a robotic batter who never misses on pitches thrown in the strike zone. "That's not baseball," Colbert said. "The whole point of baseball is to stand in one place long enough for the people in the bleachers to become so bored they'll pay $10 for a beer. This undermines everything the game stands for, folks. For instance, where would a baseball-playing robotic arm even inject steroids? Besides, we would have to create an entire robotic Congress for them to lie to, and the worst part is, it takes all the fun out of scandals. Who wants to read about a baseball player cheating on his wife with a toaster oven?"</p>

"Welsh whiskey is on offer to Russian supporters as a disinfectant," said Alexander Shprygin, head of the national team's fan club. "This will relieve any symptoms." Britain's Health Protection Agency reported the number of new swine flu cases reached 110,000 in the last week of July. Fifty-five swine flu cases have been confirmed in Russia. Russia's top doctor advised the country's citizens to avoid traveling to Britain, but Shprygin said, "Nothing will stop the Russian fans."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Finding a 'flu buddy' a key part of the plan to prepare Canadians; Major H1N1 information blitz scheduled for fall</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>610 words</div><div>8 August 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Canada's public health agency is urging Canadians to identify a "flu buddy" willing to help care for them should they get sick with human swine flu this fall.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada told Canwest News Service that Canadians should "talk with family, friends and neighbours and figure out how you might help each other during the H1N1 pandemic."</p>
<p>"Identify elderly or vulnerable relatives, friends and neighbours who may need your help," the agency said in a statement to Canwest.</p>
<p>"During a pandemic outbreak, keep an eye on these people, especially those living alone and phone them if you suspect they might be ill."</p>
<p>Officials said the department will launch the next phase of its "Citizen Readiness Campaign" this fall with a major public information campaign that will focus on family preparedness plans, immunization and keeping stockpiles of prescription medication, non-perishable food and water.</p>
<p>According to Statistics Canada, there were about 2,018,000 single or lone-parent families in Canada in 2007. In 2006, 3,327,050 people were living alone.</p>
<p>Historical data suggests that, during a pandemic, more than 50 per cent of a population may become infected with the novel virus, according to Canada's pandemic influenza plan.</p>
<p>Dr. Noni MacDonald, a leading pediatric infectious disease expert, said the World Health Organization has recommended a flu buddy system.</p>
<p>"We've never done anything like this in Canada, and I think H1N1 is going to teach us that we absolutely need to do something like this," said MacDonald, a member of the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology in Halifax and former dean of medicine at Dalhousie University.</p>
<p>If single parents, or adults living alone, get sick with the flu, "you won't be sick enough, likely, to go to hospital, but you are not necessarily going to be well enough to go to the drugstore to buy some Tylenol, you're not going to be well enough to check if you need to be driven to the emergency. You won't be well enough to do that.</p>
<p>"We cannot overwhelm our system by having everybody call 911 and say: 'I'm really sick, I need to go the hospital' when you don't. You need to organize, in your community, who is going to be your flu buddy," she said.</p>
<p>"Who is going to phone to make sure you're well, and check up on you? Who is going to be able to go and get you a prescription, or get you some juices?"</p>
<p>Some people infected with swine flu have arrived at hospital dehydrated, "and that has made some of the serious illnesses worse in some of the patients who have had bad H1N1.</p>
<p>"The disaster planning that we've done -- those big ads we have on TV about having your flashlight batteries and all of that -- is if this is an external disaster, as opposed to a health disaster," MacDonald said.</p>
<p>"It's a matter of saying, all right, what do I need to have in my cupboard if I get sick? Am I going to have my juices that I need, am I going to have my Tylenol, and I going to have Kleenex. All this stuff, I need ahead of time."</p>

</div><div>Graeme Morton   </div>

</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu has been lurking below the radar screen of most Canadians during this summer of carefree rest and relaxation.</p>
<p>But with September fast approaching, health officials and politicians are warning a major flu pandemic could have a devastating effect on Canada's population. At this week's premiers summit in Regina, Manitoba Premier Gary Doer called the flu threat "a truck coming around a corner" straight at Canadians. Doer suggested H1N1, and its potential human and financial toll, is the most important issue facing Canada's leaders.</p>
<p>Calgarian Marg Pollon has been knocking on doors and working the phones for four years, helping to organize local Christian churches into a small army of prepared volunteers who can assist health and emergency staff should H1N1 roar back with a vengeance this fall.</p>
<p>Pollon's legwork has helped create the Regional Faith Community Emergency Preparedness Coalition, which will co-ordinate the efforts of Christian leaders and lay people in providing help at the grassroots, street-by-street level. Four city churches have agreed to act as "quadrant leads," serving as co-ordinating centres for participating congregations in their area.</p>
<p>Pollon admits that at times in recent years she's felt like Noah, patiently toiling on an ark for a really rainy day while others wonder about her calling.</p>
<p>"Some churches say they want to do their own outreach should a pandemic occur. But I think it's really important to be in sync with the plans of the health and emergency authorities, so they can utilize people of faith in the most effective way. Integration is the key," says Pollon.</p>
<p>"It all comes down to how best can we care for our neighbours. We need to break down barriers between the churches and the public sector and get caring Christians out of their church buildings and into their communities," says Pollon.</p>
<p>Should H1N1 affect large swaths of Calgary's population this fall, Pollon says volunteers from city churches could be used in such areas as food preparation and distribution, pastoral care, child care for ailing parents, basic nursing tasks for those with appropriate qualifications and as drivers.</p>
<p>Pollon hopes church members will help distribute "door hangers" containing fridge magnets with vital emergency/health phone numbers as well as contact information for local churches who will lend a hand should a flu outbreak occur.</p>
<p>"I'm continually updating a database with information as to what facilities, such as commercial-style kitchens, and special skill sets in its membership that each participating church has," says Pollon. And while her ministry is within the Christian community, Pollon says all people will be served should an outbreak occur.</p>
<p>Pollon says the first wave of H1N1 flu cases last spring should have been a collective wake-up call.</p>
<p>"We've been pretty lucky in Calgary, but it does put some pressure on us to get our act together pretty quickly," says Pollon.</p>
<p>An information meeting for churches in the city's northwest quadrant is set for Wednesday, Aug. 19, at 1:30 p. m. at the Rock-Pointe Church Bowridge campus, 12 Bowridge Dr. N. W. More information is available by calling 403-263-5683.</p>

<p>A patient in the central part of the province is the sixth Albertan with H1N1 influenza to die since the new virus emerged this spring, provincial health officials said Friday.</p>
<p>The patient was elderly, said Bruce Conway, a spokesman for Alberta Health Services. However, he offered no other details on the death, citing privacy laws.</p>
<p>In total, Alberta has confirmed 1,631 cases of H1N1, also known as swine flu, including 624 cases in the Calgary area.</p>
<p>H1N1 has been associated with two local deaths. Last month, the virus claimed the life of Calgary woman Vanessa Bluebell, a young and healthy mother of four.</p>
<p>At a three-day meeting of premiers and territorial heads, which wrapped up Friday, the leaders pledged to work with each other and the federal government to prepare for a possible wave of new cases in the fall.</p>
<p>Ottawa this week said it's ordering about 50 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine, now under development.</p>
<p>The federal government is offering to pay 60 per cent of the tab, while the provinces and territories will have to cover the rest. The provinces and territories will also have to pay to administer the shots, which Premier Ed Stelmach noted Friday is a significant additional cost.</p>
<p>"In reality, the federal government will be paying only about 25 per cent of the total cost that the province will be facing with H1N1," he told the Herald.</p>
<p>Stelmach said the province will raise this concern with Ottawa, along with its request to get more federal health dollars.</p>
<p>The provincial government expects to spend$16.4 million to buy the H1N1 influenza vaccine for all Albertans, but it did not disclose Friday an estimate for the total tab.</p>
<p>Alberta Health spokesman John Tuckwell said the province's health superboard is working on plans to deliver the vaccine. Details will be announced in the fall.</p>

</p>
<p>U. S. President Barack Obama is said by White House insiders to be suffering from a bad case of "summit fatigue."</p>
<p>Since his inauguration in January, Obama has been on the road for nearly a week every month. Domestic policy advisers, pointing to the president's daunting domestic agenda-- stimulating the economy, sorting out banks and auto companies, enacting climate change legislation, remaking the U. S. health-care sector, and tackling immigration reform --complain that Obama's foreign travel makes him unavailable for lobbying Congress and the American public, as only he can do.</p>
<p>The international community has become inundated with summits. During Ronald Reagan's presidency, there was the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, the G7 and NATO; today our leaders go to all kinds of meetings, the G20, NATO summits, WTO negotiations, the Summits of the Americas, Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) meetings, and UN climate change talks, to name a few. We even have hybrid meetings such as last June's G8 Summit in L'Aquila, Italy where the number of attending countries expanded, arguably transforming the meeting into something like the "G8+BRICs+Friends."</p>
<p>Next up: the North American leaders meeting in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Sunday and Monday. This was the fifth in a series of annual meetings proposed by former U. S. president George W. Bush as part of his Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America initiative, the SPP.</p>
<p>Heading into the Guadalajara meeting, numerous questions have been raised. Now that Bush is gone, will the controversial SPP continue at all? Given summit fatigue and domestic priorities, do these leaders really need another annual meeting on their calendar?And in Washington, there is the question: Do we need to devote a whole summit to just Canada and Mexico?</p>
<p>Too much face time?</p>
<p>Obama has made the answer to the last of these questions clear by attending the Guadalajara summit, and plans to announce he will attend the next North American leaders meeting as well, which Canada will host in 2010. NAFTA and North American relations figured prominently in Obama's foreign policy statements during the presidential campaign, and this former "community organizer" has shown that he recognizes the importance of neighbourhood issues. Between his inauguration and the meeting in Guadalajara, Obama will have met with Prime Minister Stephen Harper eight times and with Mexican President Felipe Calderon six times, including presidential visits to each country and at international summits both attended.</p>
<p>There are doubtless members of Obama's own cabinet who have had less face time with him than Stephen Harper.</p>
<p>There has been, and still is, plenty to talk about. All three North American countries have parallel efforts underway to stimulate the economy. They share an auto industry that is in grave trouble. They share a continental ecosystem where winds and water bring the climate policies of one country across the border to the others--and share a largely-integrated energy market for oil, gas, and electricity. Border and immigration policies have an impact on the competitiveness of firms in these three economies as they confront European and Asian rivals.</p>
<p>In eight months, the Obama administration has given a clearer indication of its policy outlook; the Canadian and Mexican governments, in power longer, have done the same. Yet, we might call these "unilateral" policy agendas since coordination among the three countries has been sparse.</p>
<p>Obama sets agenda</p>
<p>Guadalajara looks to be something of an agenda-setting exercise with the new U. S. president. However, pre-summit discussions suggest several indicators of the road ahead. First, given the interconnections among the three North American economies, the leaders hope to coordinate national stimulus efforts so that they don't work at cross-purposes. This means addressing Canadian and Mexican concerns over "Buy American" provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that the Obama administration thought were fixed. Energy was another mutual concern: The U. S. has committed to "clean energy dialogues" with both Canada and Mexico, and it makes sense to bring these two dialogues together to share research and ideas and leverage public investment in this area.</p>
<p>Washington officials are also hopeful that the Guadalajara meeting might produce a common front on global climate change that the North American countries could press for together at the upcoming UN-sponsored climate change negotiations in Copenhagen. European countries have been working under an emissions cap and trading regime and this experience has fostered greater unity of perspective; in Asia, China and India have been the most vocal developing countries arguing against radical action that might hurt their economies. North America, in the middle, would make a real contribution if it could articulate a position acceptable to a developing economy (Mexico), a major energy producer (Canada), and a high-consumption country (The United States).</p>
<p>Co-ordinating policies, working out differences in regulation and inspection standards to improve North American competitiveness, and forming common, continental positions to take to global forums: these were the tasks that the SPP was designed to facilitate. There were notable successes. The co-operative effort by Mexico, Canada, and the United States in response to the outbreak of the H1N1 swine-flu virus is one example, since it followed a pandemic response plan that was developed by SPP working groups. Similarly, food safety officials in all three countries showed that they had learned from the BSE crisis when, using an SPP-developed protocol, they responded to evidence of salmonella contamination in Mexican tomatoes and peppers last summer with far less disruption to agriculture and trade.</p>
<p>Yet for many of the officials in the Obama administration, the fatal flaw in the SPP is that it often emphasizes process over results. Twenty working groups of officials from the three governments met privately, often in telephone conference calls that frustrated calls for transparency, allowed various conspiracy mongers to claim that the SPP was a sinister plot by cynical elites, and distracted from the goals of the effort, forcing leaders to repeatedly counter public misperceptions.</p>
<p>Reshaping summitry</p>
<p>So, it appears that Guadalajara may represent the abandonment of the SPP nominally, but work toward its objectives will continue through the annual leaders meetings where Obama, Harper and Calderon will task cabinet officials to meet to work on specific shared priorities; and cabinet ministers will in turn assign personnel to work out differences so that a report can be made to the leaders on progress in time for their next meeting or phone call.</p>
<p>Typical of the Obama approach, this pragmatism will place results ahead of market ideology and process concerns. It will also begin by making clear to the public in all three countries what it is that their governments are attempting to do, issue by issue.</p>
<p>Underlying this shift from the SPP to a new model of North American consultation and co-ordination is the conviction that there is value in having the leaders meet annually and having the governments of Canada, Mexico and the United States address regional issues together, notwithstanding the numerous bilateral meetings and multilateral summits that occur already.</p>
<p>Stephen Harper should take note of the way that Obama has reshaped North American summitry, keeping it trilateral, but trying to make it results-oriented. In 2010, Canada will host both the sixth North American leaders' meeting, and the next G8 (and friends) summit. By then, as U. S. midterm elections in November 2010 loom large for Obama, his "summit fatigue" will be at a peak.</p>
<p>The cure for the pandemic spread of summits and global confabs will involve serious triage, and meetings that fail to produce change will be the first to be eliminated. Canada has historically used bilateral meetings, regional organizations, and global forums to enhance the reach of its policies.</p>
<p>Making summits that advance Canada's interests produce results that justify the time and expense invested in them should be a foreign policy priority.</p>
<p>From Guadalajara: Over to you, Ottawa.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper will make a trip to the White House in September, his first visit with President Barack Obama in Washington.</p>
<p>The meeting will take place on Sept. 16, a week before the two leaders will see each other again in Pittsburgh at a G20 Summit.</p>
<p>A statement Friday from the Prime Minister's Office said relations between Canada and the United States are "strong, productive and wideranging."</p>
<p>"We share political, economic, environmental and social ties and many values and interests as neighbours and friends. We also share the largest bilateral flow of goods, services, people and capital between any two countries in the world," said the statement.</p>
<p>"Given the importance of the CanadaU. S. trading relationship and the highly integrated nature of the North American economy, Canada and the United States must continue to work together to promote the recovery and strengthening of our economies."</p>
<p>This will be the second bilateral meeting between Harper and Obama. The first took place in February when Harper hosted the U. S. president in Ottawa for a oneday meeting. It was Obama's first foreign trip after being inaugurated in January.</p>
<p>The leaders also met in July at the G8 meeting in Italy, and are getting together this weekend in Mexico along with that country's president, Felipe Calderon. It is the first "Three Amigos" summit for Obama.</p>
<p>During the September meeting between Harper and Obama, the two leaders are expected to discuss climate change and energy, security cooperation, economic recovery and trade, according to the Prime Minister's Office.</p>
<p>A statement from the White House said Obama is looking forward to "discussing a broad range of bilateral, hemispheric, and global issues," including the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh, December's UN Conference on Climate Change in Copenhagen, and Afghanistan.</p>

</p>
<p>P remier Ed Stelmach said Friday the recession has taken a more severe toll on jobs than expected, as the province's unemployment rate has rapidly escalated to a level not seen in more than a decade.</p>
<p>Since the economic downturn struck in October, Alberta's jobless rate has climbed month after month, nearly doubling to 7.2 per cent in July with the evaporation of 75,600 positions.</p>
<p>While still lower than the national average, the Conservative government had predicted the province would average 15,000 job losses by year's end and 6.5 per cent by next March.</p>
<p>Stelmach said he isn't certain whether the worst is over or whether more job erosion looms. However, the premier added he's confident oil and gas drilling incentives introduced this year will keep some Albertans from joining the unemployment ranks.</p>
<p>"The numbers are increasing more than originally predicted, and it's very concerning to me," Stelmach told the Herald in a phone interview after premiers and territorial leaders wrapped up three days of meetings in Regina.</p>
<p>"But I can assure all Albertans that we will maintain all the programs that are necessary to look after those who not only lost their jobs, but look at how we also can get them back into the workforce."</p>
<p>Homeless shelters across Calgary are feeling the strain of mounting job losses.</p>
<p>An influx of newly unemployed Albertans is swelling the number of people seeking help from homeless shelters to levels generally only seen on the coldest days of winter, several agencies said Friday.</p>
<p>"We've been seeing a lot of families that have been evicted due to the economic crunch," said Diana Segboer, executive director of the Inn From the Cold shelter.</p>
<p>Indeed, the recession is reverberating throughout the country's family homes, businesses and governments.</p>
<p>Canada's battered economy intersected many of the issues debated at this year's Council of the Federation meeting of provincial and territorial heads.</p>
<p>The political leaders united to support Ottawa's efforts to beat back a rising tide of "Buy American" policies in the United States, Canada's largest trading partner.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, who chaired the meeting, cautioned against erecting retaliatory trade barriers. Millions of jobs are at stake on both sides of the border, he and other premiers noted.</p>
<p>"It is important to have a very clear fair and free-trade message to the Americans to encourage them. . . to stop rattling the protectionist sabres down there. But in order to do that, our own house better be in order," Wall told reporters in Regina.</p>
<p>Canada's main bone of contention are provisions preventing Canadian firms from bidding on projects that are part of the $787-billion economic stimulus package south of the border. Prime Minister Stephen Harper is expected to raise the trade issue in meetings with U. S. President Barack Obama and Mexico's President Felipe Calderon on Sunday.</p>
<p>Although the premiers and territorial leaders reached consensus on fighting U. S. protectionism, enhancing H1N1 pandemic preparations and promoting innovation to diversify and strengthen the Canadian economy, they remain at odds over employment insurance reforms and how to deal with climate change.</p>
<p>Several environmental groups, which held protests in Regina largely targeting Alberta's growing greenhouse gas emissions, expressed disappointment Friday that the only climate change agreement reached was to encourage the federal government " to work with the United States on a continental approach."</p>
<p>B. C. Premier Gordon Campbell-- whose province supports cap and trade along with Manitoba, Quebec and Ontario -- said Canada can be a leader in dealing with climate change, as the federal government prepares for a critical UN climate change conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December, where political leaders from around the world will gather to build an international agreement to succeed the Kyoto accord.</p>
<p>"We don't want to have happen what happened in Kyoto, which was grand pronouncements and no action," Campbell said. "We want to have a solid, concrete proposal put forward by Canada, where we can work in concert with the federal government to put the actions in place that will reduce greenhouse gases."</p>
<p>Stelmach, however, cautioned against adopting tougher climate change measures than the United States.</p>
<p>He told the Herald lobbyists in Washington, hired by the Alberta government, are signalling that an American bill on climate change could be further watered down. The Waxman-Markey bill, which first proposed trimming greenhouse gas emissions 20 per cent from the 2005 level by 2020, passed the U. S. House with a 17 per cent reduction goal.</p>
<p>Stelmach suggested that figure could drop to 14 per cent once the Senate is done with the legislation. Ottawa's most recent targets are to reduce emissions 20 per cent below 2006's mark by 2020 and 60 to 70 per cent by 2050.</p>
<p>"As I've said before let's not be boy scouts," Stelmach said. "Let's make sure we don't put our oil and gas industry, our agriculture industry and our forestry industry in a situation where they'll lose any competitive advantage that they may have by signing an agreement that will put undue stress on those industries."</p>
<p>Later this month, the Alberta government will deliver its first fiscal update for 2009-10. The premier has said he expects the province's$4.7-billion projected deficit will be higher due to weak natural gas prices and a strong Canadian dollar, but didn't offer a new estimate Friday.</p>
<p>"The dollar has had the biggest impact on our budget," Stelmach said. "That is really hurting our bottom line, but it's also hurting manufacturing jobs right across the country."</p>
<p>Jacques Marcil, an economist with the Canada West Foundation in Calgary, noted Canada is seeing many good jobs replaced with self-employment or part-time work. Marcil suspects more jobs will be lost before a turnaround.</p>
<p>"The job market is nowhere close to swinging back into the positive and Alberta and B. C. are among the worst," he said.</p>

</p>
<p>The "Showdown in Regina" that environmental groups had hoped for failed to materialize Friday, as Canada's premiers ended three days of meetings by sidestepping contentious aspects of the climate change debate.</p>
<p>Instead, premiers and territorial leaders announced consensus on the need to prepare for the ongoing H1N1 pandemic, fight U. S. protectionism, improve the country's employment insurance program and promote innovation to diversify and strengthen the Canadian economy.</p>
<p>The premiers had offered different approaches to combat climate change, but opted for an end-of-meeting statement simply stating they agreed Canada would be "well served to work with the United States on a continental approach."</p>
<p>"Every single premier at this table respects the fact that other premiers and other provinces have taken significant action with respect to the issue of carbon, with respect to the issue of climate," said Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, who dismissed the efforts of lobbyists to pit central and western premiers against one another in the climate debate at several protests during the week.</p>
<p>Environmental groups accused the premiers of making "lacklustre motherhood statements" rather than making their meeting a "rumble in Regina."</p>
<p>"The premiers should have taken off the gloves and gone bare-knuckle with Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ottawa," said Dave Martin, climate and energy co-ordinator for Greenpeace Canada. "We were also hoping that at least one or two provinces might step up to the plate and make the kind of greenhouse gas reductions that we've been calling for, which is the 25-per-cent reduction by 2020 from 1990 levels."</p>
<p>Saskatchewan has been a holdout on a so-called cap-and-trade system, which would see industrial emissions capped and larger polluters able to purchase credits from greener companies, saying revenues generated from any caps should stay within the jurisdiction to help find technological solutions to climate change.</p>
<p>But Wall suggested he might warm to a North American cap-and-trade system if that's where countries are inevitably headed. However, he said such a system should be modified to better suit coal-reliant jurisdictions.</p>
<p>"Let's remember that the American plan, I believe supported by the Obama administration, is going to provide significant concessions to coal-based economies," said Wall, calling the U. S. approach a way to reduce carbon emissions without "kneecapping" the economy.</p>
<p>The U. S. bill also proposes greenhouse-gas reductions of 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020. The Canadian target is 20 per cent below 2006 levels.</p>
<p>Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach said he has some reservations about the U. S. bill. "There's reference to executive powers of the president for border adjustment taxes. We really don't know what that means, and how and under what conditions those taxes may be applied," Stelmach said.</p>
<p>B. C. Premier Gordon Campbell --whose province supports cap and trade along with Manitoba, Quebec and Ontario--said Canada can be a leader in dealing with climate change. He welcomed an invitation from federal Environment Minister Jim Prentice that the provinces join him at a United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen later this year.</p>
<p>"We don't want to have happen what happened in Kyoto, which was grand pronouncements and no action," Campbell said. With files from James Wood, Saskatoon StarPhoenix</p>

<p>H1N1 infects young campers - Aug. 7</p>
<p>Let’s get this straight. The names of all restaurants that violate health regulations are published by the Waterloo Regional Department of Health; and that is a good thing. We can all figure out that even if the refrigerator was off by two degrees, a good percentage of people that may have seen the restaurant’s name in the paper will avoid that establishment, because as the saying goes, it’s a smoking gun.</p>
<p>In Toronto and north of Toronto a few summer camps became the target of the H1N1 virus approximately three weeks ago. Guess what? Health officials in those regions provided much information to the public, even though there was no risk to the public. The names of the camps were made public.</p>
<p>How can we trust our officials when they cannot do the right thing by publishing the name of the camp here in Waterloo Region where there was an outbreak of the H1N1 virus? But they do publish all the restaurants that had any health violation.</p>
<p>There are a couple of old sayings: "You cannot trust anyone but yourself," and, "If you have something to hide, keep quiet." We can all bet that regional personnel know the name of the camp - why not us? I guess the public cannot be trusted with information.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Air Canada plans to cut more deeply to reach profit</b>
</div><div>By Ross Marowits  </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>783 words</div><div>8 August 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.  </div>
</p>
<p>MONTREAL</p>
<p>Air Canada says it's embarking on a cultural change that will result in deeper cost cutting, including possible route and fleet reductions, as it attempts to restore its profitability in the face of ongoing economic turbulence.</p>
<p>The country's largest airline is now aiming for $500 million in annualized cost reductions and revenue enhancements within three years, double the previous target.</p>
<p>An internal tactical team will implement more than 100 initiatives to reduce costs by about $400 million, including $50 million this year and $250 million in 2010. Air Canada also plans to increase revenues by $100 million.</p>
<p>"Everything will be thoroughly evaluated over the next short while with a sense of urgency, nothing will be overlooked. This includes routes, schedules, fleet, supplier relationships and all of our go-to-market strategies," chief executive Calin Rovinescu said Friday during a conference call about second quarter results. The Montreal-based carrier reported Friday that its net income increased to $155 million or $1.55 per share for the quarter ended June 30 compared to profits of $122 million or $1.22 per share recorded in the same quarter a year ago.</p>
<p>Excluding a $355 million foreign exchange gain and other non-cash adjustments, it lost $268 million.</p>
<p>Air Canada says operating revenues fell to $2.3 billion from $2.8 billion booked the year before, with passenger revenue down 16 per cent to $2.1 billion. Like other carriers, Air Canada was affected by the economic downturn which has eroded demand for air travel.</p>
<p>Passenger traffic dropped 7.9 per cent in the quarter, more than the 5.4 per cent reduction in capacity.</p>
<p>Among the items identified in the cost savings plan so far are an estimated $40 million from a revised capacity purchase agreement with Air Canada Jazz, $50 million from inventory and baggage handling, $30 million from corporate discounts and $50 million from large third-party vendors.</p>
<p>None of the cost savings require union approvals, even though they include undefined "improved workforce management."</p>
<p>"Attacking the non-labour portion of the cost pile could result obviously in some cases in efficiencies and those efficiencies could have some consequences on staffing levels but we're not looking at actually reducing any of our wages under our collective agreement," he told analysts.</p>
<p>The airline said the changes won't affect consumers.</p>
<p>However, economic conditions will force it to reduce system capacity by three to four per cent during the current third quarter ending Sept. 30. The July-September period is usually the busiest quarter for airlines because of vacations.</p>
<p>For 2009, deeper domestic capacity cuts should reduce the system capacity by 4.5 to 5.5 per cent, more than the previous guidance in the four to five per cent range.</p>
<p>Chris Murray of CIBC World Markets said the cost reduction plan, although largely general at this point, could have a big impact on the airline's fairly thin margin.</p>
<p>"If you're (adding) $500 million in operating earnings, that's a big swing for these guys," he said, noting that it could help to narrow the estimated 30 per cent cost advantage enjoyed by Calgary-based rival WestJet.</p>
<p>But Jacques Kavafian of Research Capital Corp. said the cost reductions need to be faster, deeper and more structural.</p>
<p>"Cutting costs by $400 million is just not enough. It cuts their loss in half but they're still losing money," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>He also said the carrier can't wait three years to fully realize the benefits of the reductions.</p>
<p>Kavafian said Air Canada will "tweak" with supply contracts whose costs will eventually return instead of making the route and fleet reductions needed to help it in the long-term.</p>
<p>But Rovinescu said the airline needs to undertake a cultural change to nimbly respond to opportunities and react quickly to challenges and position it for an eventual recovery.</p>
<p>Air Canada's ability to raise more than $1 billion of liquidity "provides us with a window of opportunity to make structural changes which we cannot and will not squander."</p>
<p>Falling passenger travel, particularly among business and premium groups caused the carrier to record a $113 million operating loss in the second quarter, reversing year-earlier operating profits of $7 million. Premium cabin revenue accounted for more than 40 per cent of total passenger revenue decreases.</p>
<p>The airline's weakened operating results were despite $276 million in lower fuel costs. The H1N1 virus has a $30 million impact in the quarter as capacity was diverted to other sun spots and some Asian visitors cancelled plans.</p>

</div><div>By Alexander Panetta   </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Mexico's president won't get any short-term guarantees when he urges Prime Minister Stephen Harper this weekend to drop new travel restrictions on his citizens.</p>
<p>But he may get his wish eventually.</p>
<p>Mexican officials say President Felipe Calderon, who is hosting a two-day North American Leaders' Summit in Guadalajara starting Sunday, will urge Harper to reconsider a visa requirement recently slapped on Mexican travellers.</p>
<p>The Canadian government says that's impossible - for now.</p>
<p>"I don't anticipate the lifting of visas at this upcoming summit," Harper spokesperson Dimitri Soudas said.</p>
<p>"We are reviewing our refugee policies . . . In the short term, I think what's important here is to preserve the integrity of the Canadian immigration system."</p>
<p>But other officials strongly hinted that Canada will drop the visa requirement once the system works faster and is better able to cope with thousands of in-land refugee claimants.</p>
<p>"We could definitely lift visas on a lot more countries - including Mexico and the Czech Republic," one government official said.</p>
<p>"It's not like we enjoy imposing visas on friendly countries."</p>
<p>Last month, Ottawa began forcing visas on travellers from Mexico or the Czech Republic, which produce the greatest number of Canada's refugee claims.</p>
<p>With the refugee system burdened by an expanding backlog of cases, the government says it plans reforms this fall that would speed up processing times.</p>
<p>Mexican officials say they have pressed Canada to consider measures like pre-screening passengers at Mexican airports, to weed out false refugee claimants.</p>
<p>They describe the visa policy as an administrative headache for the 250,000 Mexicans who visit Canada each year, and an affront coming from a friendly nation.</p>
<p>"Mr. Calderon will bring up the visa issue with Mr. Harper," a Mexican official said.</p>
<p>"We'll propose some actions to modify the Canadian measure."</p>
<p>The news of the visa restriction could not have come at a worse time for Mexico.</p>
<p>It was delivered personally by Harper to Calderon in a conversation while that country was in the midst of a health and economic panic over swine flu, an official said.</p>
<p>"(Harper) sort of said, ‘Felipe, we're going to impose the visas. But we're not going to do it during H1N1,'</p>
<p>"(Calderon) was grateful we didn't do it during H1N1."</p>
<p>The gathering in Guadalajara may be the first North American summit in memory where Canada's relationship with Mexico - and not the U.S. - generates the lion's share of attention.</p>
<p>Harper and Calderon will have a pair of meetings with U.S. President Barack Obama - including supper on Sunday evening - where they will discuss the recession, the flu pandemic, climate change and security.</p>
<p>There will be no one-on-one meeting with Obama, but Harper's office announced Friday that he will visit the White House for a private meeting on Sept. 16.</p>
<p>The visa measure has been frustrating for Mexican businesspeople, vacationers, and tourists. It's been especially difficult for visitors in outlying regions, who need to bring or mail their passports to Mexico City for processing at the Canadian embassy, an official said.</p>
<p>Canada says it will set up small application centres at various points around the country.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Schools ready to battle swine flu; Sanitizer, posters in place</b>

<div>611 words</div><div>8 August 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Hand sanitizers have been filled, the posters have been hung and protocols are in place. Windsor's university and college are ready for the swine flu.</p>
<p>"We have already been proactive," said John Fairley, the communications director at St. Clair College. "We have signage everywhere, in the washrooms, common areas. There (are) ... hand sanitizers in various locations around the college ... we already had a meeting of senior administrators."</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus has been known to affect youth, mainly because they are not immune to this strain of the flu. According to Dr. Allen Heimann, Windsor's medical officer of health, about 35 of the 47 cases in the city has involved people under 30.</p>
<p>"What we look at is a certainly significant number of cases are in the younger age groups," said Heimann. "The general feeling is, individuals under the age of 30 have no significant immunity to this strain."</p>
<p>Heimann added that those over 50 or 60 were around during the 1957 and 1968 pandemic and may have grown immune to the virus.</p>
<p>As students come back to school in the fall, the number of cases may increase.</p>
<p>"We don't know what's going to happen in the fall. There's a belief we may ... see an increase in cases," Heimann said.</p>
<p>"Prior to school getting out, we were seeing younger individuals who were most affected. If there are individuals who are ill with the flu, it may be more easily spread within groups."</p>
<p>Because the virus emerged during the end of the school year, universities and colleges haven't had as much experience with this flu as other institutions.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said students living in dormitories may be at risk.</p>
<p>"It's important that colleges and universities plan for the possibility of outbreak, particularly in dormitory settings," King said.</p>
<p>"A dormitory would be a place where one might expect outbreaks occurring."</p>
<p>St. Clair College has prepared by emphasizing the importance of communication.</p>
<p>"We're ready," Fairley said. "There's good communication between the college and the campus."</p>
<p>If a student living on campus becomes ill, they can call in or visit the health centre, said Elyse Maindonald, the health centre's nurse practitioner and the pandemic influenza co-ordinator.</p>
<p>"We have a separate room that's specifically for respiratory illnesses, and at that time, they would be assessed ... we would go from there," she said.</p>
<p>Students in programs that deal with nursing, dental work or ambulance training are at higher risk, as are pregnant students, Maindonald said, adding that educating students about the virus is essential.</p>
<p>"Education is just so very vital, we could have all the equipment that you could possible store ... it's not going to do us any good. People have to be educated. They have to believe there's a problem, know what it is and how to handle it," she said.</p>
<p>The University of Windsor is also trying to raise awareness at school.</p>
<p>They encourage frequent handwashing, sneezing into tissues or sleeves and social distancing if symptoms appear, said Lori Lewis, the university's spokeswoman.</p>
<p>"We have set up a number of hand sanitizer stations on campus. We have to appreciate that during the summer months, (the school was) not as populated," she said, adding that faculty and administration has held frequent meetings about the subject.</p>
<p>Symptoms for the H1N1 virus include a sudden onset of high fever, chills, fatigue, a sore throat and runny nose, coughing, muscle aches, headaches and, sometimes, diarrhea or vomiting.</p>

</p>
<p>In the 1978 movie Grease, there is a perceptively written scene in which the students of the fictional Rydell High School return from summer holidays and relate their adventures to their friends, carefully putting the most positive "spin" on their conquests -- sometimes bending the truth to the breaking point.</p>
<p>Which brings us to another summertime adventure: this week's meeting of the Council of the Federation (what used to be called the annual premiers' conference), held in Regina.</p>
<p>The news conference at the conclusion of the gathering was a particularly fine example of "summer love". The premiers showered each other with praise for their earnest and reasonable attitudes. The host, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, used a reporter's question on the potentially thorny issue of handling climate change across this country's provinces, each with unique needs and priorities, waxing eloquent on how there was broad understanding of how each province had taken "significant action" on addressing this issue.</p>
<p>The thing to remember about this summer's "bromance" (note the absence of women) is that there can be plenty of winners. Wall, the new "cool kid" in this class of premiers, has little need to impress, say, Ontario or Prince Edward Island voters, so premiers did not have to bash each other. Instead of the "showdown in Regina" predicted by environmentalists, it was the "love-in in Regina".</p>
<p>The true importance of such gatherings resides in the issues the premiers and their advisers bring forward for discussion: H1N1 flu contingency plans, addressing U.S. trade protectionism typified by "Buy America' rules, changing requirements covering the oddly named employment insurance plan and, of course, the big kid in the class: the recession.</p>
<p>Moreover, whatever the premiers decided, everything must be presented to the unsmiling, earnest "principal", who lives in Ottawa and meets this weekend with the presidents of Mexico and the U.S.</p>
<p>Past premiers' conferences teach us that the premiers can agree, disagree and recommend what they wish, but it is the federal government's political will, jurisdiction and spending power that makes things happen.</p>
<p>And things might not happen at all if, as widely speculated, Canadians face a federal election this autumn.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The weather is forecast to be a balmy 27 degrees in Guadalajara, Mexico, tomorrow but Prime Minister Stephen Harper should feel a slight nip in the air when he arrives there for the annual North American Leaders' Summit.</p>
<p>This year's Three Amigos gathering among Canada, the United States and Mexico will be the first time Mr. Harper meets Mexican President Felipe Calderon since slapping surprise travel restrictions on visitors from Mexico last month.</p>
<p>He's likely to get a cool reception, particularly after the Prime Minister's Office signalled yesterday it has no intention of lifting visa requirements it has imposed on Mexican visitors – or even promising such – during the two-day meeting.</p>
<p>Mexican concerns – from the visa flap to Mr. Calderon's prolonged and bloody war against drug cartels – are likely to loom large at a summit where Canada's biggest demand is also likely to go unfulfilled. Ottawa will press U.S. President Barack Obama for an exemption from protectionist “Buy America” procurement policies but Canadian officials are playing down the chances of a breakthrough.</p>
<p>The annual Three Amigos meeting itself – only five years old – is showing signs of fading in importance. It's jettisoned an ambitious set of three-way talks adopted during U.S. president George W. Bush's term in office to advance economic and security integration of North Americans. This much-ballyhooed Security and Prosperity Partnership is missing from the agenda, as are the senior North American business executives that had been invited to the past two summits to help steer discussions.</p>
<p>Unlike Mexico, Canada won't even get a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Obama during the Guadalajara summit. Mr. Harper will have to wait until Sept. 16 for a tête-à-tête at the White House.</p>
<p>Michael Hart, a former Canadian trade negotiator who teaches at Carleton University, calls the summits irrelevant. “We have an intense, complicated relationship with the United States. We do not with the Mexicans. The Mexicans have an intense complicated relationship with the U.S. They do not with Canada.”</p>
<p>Derek Burney, a former Canadian ambassador to Washington, said the trilateral talks in and of themselves haven't generated much in the way of substance over the years.</p>
<p>“When you get into a trilateral setting, you're dealing with low-common-denominator commonality and you're evading some of the harder bilateral issues that need to be addressed.”</p>
<p>Champions of the trilateral approach, including Canadian Council of Chief Executives CEO Thomas d'Aquino, say the meetings still give prime ministers valuable face time with the U.S. president.</p>
<p>Colin Robertson, a veteran diplomat and fellow at Carleton University, agrees. “Don't discount the importance of proximity,” he said. He warned Canadians not to underestimate the increasing importance that Mexico is taking on in the minds of Americans because of Latino immigration and power and population shifts to the U.S. South.</p>
<p>“If we don't factor in Mexico, which is sometimes the temptation, then we play at a disadvantage.”</p>
<p>The NAFTA leaders will use several hours of joint face time in Guadalajara to prepare for the September Group-of-20 economic summit, to talk about a feared fall resurgence of the swine flu virus, and to discuss how to fight climate change in a way that doesn't leave them offside with the United States.</p>
<p>But Canadian officials already appear to be looking to the Sept. 16 meeting between Mr. Harper and Mr. Obama as more important than the Guadalajara summit for addressing pressing issues. The Prime Minister's Office made a point of announcing the September White House get-together during a press briefing yesterday on the North American Leader's Summit.</p>
<p>After the Three Amigos meeting concludes Monday, Mr. Harper will head to Panama where he is expected to sign a free-trade deal with the Central American country.</p>

<p>There is strong speculation that Paul Zed, chief of staff to Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff, is poised to announce he will run again in his hometown, Saint John. Mr. Zed was defeated in the 2008 election, but he has been working hard in the riding, while at the same time working for his friend, the Liberal Leader, in Ottawa. With expectations of a fall election, Mr. Zed has been all over the local newspapers and recently raised thousands of dollars in his community to fight poverty. It is expected that Ian Davey, Mr. Ignatieff's principal secretary, would replace Mr. Zed as chief of staff.</p>
<p>Coincidentally (or maybe, not), Mr. Ignatieff is headed east next week on a major tour, hopping from province to province in a little plane. The leader, who has been criticized for being in hiding this summer, is stopping in Nova Scotia, PEI and New Brunswick. He is making a substantive speech in Saint John and attending an exclusive $2,200-a-ticket fundraiser event at Frank McKenna's New Brunswick cottage. Mr. McKenna is the former Canadian ambassador to Washington and former New Brunswick premier. About 50 people have purchased tickets, making this a $110,000 event. And who may accompany him? Paul Zed? Not bad exposure for a potential candidate.</p>
<p>Elizabeth May: on the move</p>
<p>Green Party Leader Elizabeth May was unsuccessful in her bid to unseat the popular Defence Minister, Peter MacKay, in his Nova Scotia riding in the last election. She raised some eyebrows about her judgment in picking a winnable riding. Now she is shopping for a new riding, saying she expects a fall election triggered by a no-confidence vote in late September. She visited the Ontario riding of Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound on Thursday where the Green candidate came second by 10,000 votes to the Tory in 2008. Said Ms. May, “I do plan to be in the House after the next general election.” If not, she may not survive as leader.</p>
<p>Carolyn Stewart-Olsen:</p>
<p>Senate speculation</p>
<p>The departure from the PMO of Harper loyalist Carolyn Stewart-Olsen has the rumour mill in overdrive about Senate appointments. If Prime Minister Stephen Harper wants to load up the Senate with Tories before an expected fall election (which is not a slam dunk for the Tories), now is the time to do it.</p>
<p>It is expected that Ms. Stewart-Olsen will be rewarded with a seat, likely the one available in New Brunswick. That leaves seven other vacancies in the 105-seat chamber, which the Liberals still dominate: one each in Nova Scotia, Manitoba and Nunavut and two each in Ontario and Quebec. Former Nova Scotia premier Rodney MacDonald, who just quit politics after losing the provincial election, is a possibility, as is Doug Finley, the mastermind behind the Harper victories, for an Ontario seat. Don Plett, the Conservative Party president, is a possibility for the Manitoba seat.</p>
<p>Flu and vaccines:</p>
<p>an emergency meeting</p>
<p>on Parliament Hill</p>
<p>The all-party House of Commons health committee has called an emergency meeting for Wednesday, following the industry committee, which met yesterday on the Nortel sale. MPs on the health committee are coming back to deal with preparedness and response around a possible H1N1 outbreak. “We want to … make sure that all Canadians have confidence in what they should do in the fall,” said physician Carolyn Bennett, a Liberal MP and committee member.</p>
<p>Hot and not</p>
<p>Hot: Nathan Cullen, the B.C. New Democratic MP, helped raise awareness for the health of the Skeena River by swimming a portion of it with an environmental activist this week.</p>
<p>Mr. Cullen has recently competed in two triathlons and is a strong swimmer, a requirement for a dip in the powerful Skeena.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Officials bolster H1N1 strategy for First Nations -</b>
</div><div>By Aldo Santin  </div>

<p>THE image of dozens of aboriginal residents being flown to Winnipeg for treatment of the H1N1 virus convinced Manitoba and Ontario to revise how northern native communities will be treated if the outbreak occurs again.</p>
<p>The chief medical officers of health for both provinces said Friday that the Garden Hill and St. Theresa Point experiences in May convinced them the risk factors for treatment should be expanded to include anyone who is aboriginal.</p>
<p>"As soon as we saw a pattern that showed severe disease was more common in people of aboriginal descent, then that became an additional risk factor and we communicated that to health officers very soon after that," Dr. Joel Kettner, the Manitoba's chief medical officer of health, said.</p>
<p>The province's clinical care guidelines for the treatment of H1N1 outbreaks included a list of risk factors that physicians and nurses had to determine before antiviral medication, such as Tamiflu, would be administered to patients. For most patients, antivirals would only be prescribed if they were severely ill.</p>
<p>It was those guidelines that prompted the chiefs of Garden Hill and St. Theresa Point to complain that health officials were ignoring the realities of northern living. The chiefs said their communities lacked simple amenities such as running water and hand sanitizers and that few, if any, of their people were given antivirals until after they were flown to Winnipeg for treatment.</p>
<p>Chiefs David Harper and David McDougall were incensed when they learned that an outbreak on the isolated reserve of Sandy Lake in northwestern Ontario was treated more aggressively than the outbreak in their communities.</p>
<p>When the virus appeared at Sandy Lake, three weeks after it occurred in Manitoba, hundreds of doses of antiviral medication were flown into the community. A Health Canada official said late Friday that 160 Sandy Lake residents were treated with antiviral drugs.</p>
<p>Unlike what happened in Garden Hill and St. Theresa Point, no one from Sandy Lake had to be flown out for treatment.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said she altered her province's care guidelines immediately upon assuming her post in mid-June, adding that the Garden Hill and St. Theresa Point experience played a part in her decision.</p>
<p>Health Canada officials said the Manitoba situation played a key role in Ontario changing its guidelines.</p>
<p>"Following lessons learned in Manitoba... the Province of Ontario adapted their provincial guidelines to increase the antiviral allocation to northern communities," a Health Canada spokeswoman stated in an email to the Free Press.</p>
<p>King said conditions -- lack of running water, lack of extensive medical facilities and overcrowding -- faced by aboriginal residents in northern and isolated communities make them more susceptible to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"The combination of all those factors led us to implement an aggressive early treatment strategy," King said, adding her decision was affected by experiences in other countries as well as what happened in Manitoba.</p>
<p>Kettner said that if an outbreak occurs again, as is expected in the fall, then any aboriginal person showing flu-like symptoms will be prescribed antiviral medication.</p>
<p>Kettner said that even under the old guidelines, doctors and nurses on nursing stations in the north could have prescribed antiviral medication to anyone they believed needed it, adding he's not aware of any incident where the medication was not available if it was prescribed.</p>
<p>Health Canada officials said that since the spring outbreak, additional supplies of antiviral drugs have been purchased for all First Nations communities, adding they believe local health-care workers have access to enough antivirals without having to tap into provincial stockpiles.</p>
<p>St. Theresa Point Chief McDougall said he wasn't aware of a change in the H1N1 treatment strategy but added he is pleased.</p>
<p>"I welcome that kind of aggressive strategy but I don't understand why they're being so secretive about it," McDougall said.</p>
<p>He said residents in the Island Lake communities don't understand why they appear to have received inferior care compared with the Sandy Lake residents, adding provincial and federal health officials need to be more open with First Nations. "All Ottawa would tell us was that everything that could be done had been done and that we should trust them," McDougall said. "We have to work together."</p>

<div>FLU PANDEMIC / END OF THE LINE FOR THOSE OVER 65?</div>
<div>Focus</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Just add this to the growing list of the indignities of old age</b>
</div><div>MICHAEL VALPY  </div>
<div>969 words</div><div>8 August 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>F3</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

<p>At the meeting of provincial premiers and aboriginal leaders this week in Regina, Manitoba's Gary Doer characterized the H1N1 influenza pandemic careening toward Canada as a “truck coming around a corner.”</p>
<p>Make that two trucks – or better, a train – if you're of a certain age. The wattled age. A wrinkly, with your reasoning, speed of thought and spatial visualization known to look like the insides of a putrefied cantaloupe and your productivity measured far down the ski slope of life.</p>
<p>Italian researcher Stefano Merler, writing recently in the medical journal BMC Infectious Diseases, says that halting the prescription of flu drugs for those over 65 could be the most effective way of containing infection and saving lives.</p>
<p>Mathematically modelling the 1918-19 flu pandemic that claimed between 20 million and 40 million lives and was most lethal to those in their 30s, Dr. Merler calculated that when antiviral drugs were given to adults of working age, the mortality rate dropped by as much as 40 per cent. But when they were given to those over 65, the death rate fell by no more than 2.8 per cent.</p>
<p>“Although a policy of age-specific prioritization of antiviral use will be controversial ethically,” he said, in what could be termed a mouthful, “it may be the most effective use of stockpiled therapies.</p>
<p>“This is of particular importance for countries where the amount stockpiled is well below the World Health Organization's suggested level.”</p>
<p>Like Italy, which has enough doses stockpiled for only an estimated 12 per cent of its population – considerably below the WHO's 25-per-cent minimum – but likely not Canada, with sufficient stockpiled doses calculated to treat everyone expected to get sick enough to see a doctor or take a day off from work (keeping in mind that the old seem more resistant to infection than the young).</p>
<p>Although who knows? When the waterhole gets smaller, the animals get meaner, and our Red Tory collectivism in Canada belongs to history's dust.</p>
<p>A British newspaper columnist uses the word codgercide to describe the implications of Dr. Merler's European Union-funded research, and, in truth, if you are old, you do have grounds for being apprehensive about how warmly welcome you are at the waterhole, especially when you are being called “dear” and offered a seat on public transit.</p>
<p>The old have become too numerous. They are starting to cross the age-65 line in mobs. They are not as good to look at as the young. They are not chipmunks. People are nice to chipmunks in their garden, even if they do steal bulbs, because they are cute. Old people are not cute.</p>
<p>Ageism is the new pre-60s sexism. “Although she's 63, her mind is still as sharp as a tack.” “What a shot from those 59-year-old hands.”</p>
<p>A survey by the Canadian Association for Retired Persons (CARP) of more than 4,000 of its members found almost two-thirds of respondents claiming to have experienced ageism, most by being addressed in a demeaning fashion (35 per cent) or being made the butt of a joke (29 per cent).</p>
<p>More than half (57 per cent) say they have been exposed to ageist stereotyping in the media – 69 per cent of women, no doubt reading about crepey cleavage and saggy booty and wondering where to hide until God calls them home.</p>
<p>“So now living longer is a bad thing!” a CARP editorial says. “That is the sum total of a simplistic analysis that is popular today. The pernicious result of this kind of dissociative thinking is that public policy – and attitudes – will continue to kick older Canadians to the curb.”</p>
<p>British studies show that breast cancer and stroke sufferers who are over 65 get inferior medical treatment to those younger than 65 – less chemotherapy, less radiotherapy, less breast-conserving surgery, less lifestyle counselling and, for stroke victims, less access to brain scans (only one in 20 over 75 are given MRIs compared with one in four under 75).</p>
<p>Workplace age-discrimination lawsuits in the United States are increasing explosively, although a recent ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court has made it harder for workers to litigate successfully by raising the bar on what is required to establish age-prejudicial behaviour by employers.</p>
<p>But we know employers don't want the old, all that foofaraw aside about them being valuable for their knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>Research published this year by University of Virginia psychologist Timothy Salthouse says that reasoning, speed of thought and spatial visualization begin declining at the end of one's 20s.</p>
<p>Memory stays intact until the age of 37 and then begins to go. After 60, general knowledge and vocabulary stop improving.</p>
<p>Researchers at Germany's Max Planck Institute for the Biology of Aging say productivity starts to decline in early middle age and by 50 is yodelling down the hill – a decline that applies not just to bankers, stockbrokers and, ha-ha, lawyers, but also to writers (notably male writers), painters and musicians.</p>
<p>What employer wants the wrinklies? Not many.</p>
<p>However, the wrinklies come with a poison pill. They're a demographic time bomb.</p>
<p>If they're shooed away from the workplace and told to sit on their hands, either the birth rate has to increase dramatically to provide more workers to support them, or immigration from young-population countries has to increase dramatically. With people inevitably getting bad-tempered about paying for the layabout old.</p>
<p>The easiest option is to extend the length of their working lives, and provide them with benefits and give them Tamiflu.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Rushing HIN1 vaccine for fall unethical, prof says - Claims there will be doubts about safety, effectiveness</b>
</div><div>By Aldo Santin </div>
<div>740 words</div><div>7 August 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>THE creation of a vaccine for the H1N1 virus is being rushed for late-fall distribution without the public being told that it may not work or could be harmful, a University of Manitoba professor says.</p>
<p>Arthur Schafer, director of the U of M's Centre for Professional and Applied Ethics, said Thursday the fall release of a vaccine cannot be done in time without a lot of doubt about its safety and effectiveness.</p>
<p>"It will have been tested only for a short time and only on a comparatively small sample of patients," Schafer said, adding that isn't enough time to determine it will protect the public.</p>
<p>"My argument is that it's wrong to lead the public to believe that the vaccine will be a 'magic bullet,'" Schafer said. "Nobody knows that. Nobody can know that." He said the public should be told about the uncertainties.</p>
<p>Ottawa announced Thursday that 50.4 million doses of an H1N1 vaccine will be purchased and should be ready for distribution.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said during a teleconference that clinical trials of the vaccine will be carried out in late September and the vaccine distributed across the country in November.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said enough vaccine has been ordered to ensure everyone who wants or needs it can get it, adding public health officials expect upwards of 60 per cent of Canadians will be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said the 50.4 million doses of the vaccine are enough to ensure two doses for every individual who is receiving it. If more is needed, it can be ordered in the new year, he said.</p>
<p>A senior official with the World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday that fast-tracking H1N1 vaccine production will not undermine safety concerns.</p>
<p>But Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny said countries using a vaccine will need to be vigilant to look for and investigate any reports of adverse effects.</p>
<p>Schafer said the scientific research shows that the effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccines in preventing healthy people from developing the flu has been marginal. The effectiveness of antiviral drugs, designed to mitigate the effects of flu, are equally unimpressive and research shows they can have dangerous side-effects, he said.</p>
<p>"Good ethics requires good facts, and the ethical debate so far has been who should be the first (to get the vaccine) and there has been virtually no discussion of the safety and effectiveness of the drug."</p>
<p>Schafer said an independent review of the effectiveness of flu vaccines concluded that healthy adults shouldn't be taking them, adding he wonders why anyone would want to take a vaccine for H1N1 that's been rushed to the public and without proper studies to determine it's safe.</p>
<p>Schafer said public health officials are aware of the scientific evidence, but that he believes they and politicians are rushing a vaccine without explaining they don't know if it will work.</p>
<p>"The public is entitled to know that no one can be sure whether the (H1N1) vaccine will be genuinely beneficial overall," Schafer said. "No one can be sure that the benefits will outweigh the harms.</p>
<p>"Will the vaccine be a life-saver? Possibly, but possibly not. That's what the public needs to understand."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Premier Gary Doer said all governments in Canada must make it a priority to plan for the return of H1N1 this fall.</p>
<p>The potential H1N1 outbreak is like "a truck coming around the corner," Doer said from the premiers' conference in Regina, adding the provinces and Ottawa must be ready with vaccine and antiviral plans, and outlines for how to handle everything from the effect an outbreak could have on hospitals and paramedics to school absences and workplace productivity.</p>
<p>Doer said one of his chief concerns is the low rate of regular flu vaccination among the most vulnerable in some communities. It's as low as 15 per cent in some places, he said.</p>
<p>That means there has to be a lot of planning now to ensure the vaccine reaches where it's most needed as soon as it's ready and that once it is distributed, it is actually given to the people who need it most.</p>

<p>It may sound overly simplistic to say that the premiers agreed where they could agree and disagreed where one would expect them to disagree.</p>
<p>But we tend to make issues like ones debated at the Council of the Federation on Thursday more complicated than they really are.</p>
<p>The unvarnished reality is there are just some issues in this massive nation where there is little or no natural consensus. Employment insurance emerged as one such issue during the second day of the annual meeting of provincial and territorial leaders at Regina's Government House.</p>
<p>It's also likely overly simplistic to suggest that the leaders only agreed on matters in which they could exercise little or no influence. Unfortunately, though, there did seem to be an element of that in the premiers' overwhelming opposition to the "Buy American" sentiment south of the border -- an issue all Canadians would oppose but an issue that, nevertheless, seems well out our hands.</p>
<p>Perhaps indicative of the day's difficulties, the H1N1 flu issue -- yet another issue that the premiers were finding it easier to agree on than to solve -- exhausted the premiers' morning session. Moreover, the emerging communique that called on "the federal government to take a strong role as a full partner in all elements addressing an H1N1 virus" hardly seemed a daring attempt to take charge.</p>
<p>But, really, was there another solution to be found in Regina Thursday? What else could the premiers do? And the same questions could be asked about the premiers' solidarity opposing Buy American, plus one additional question: When it comes to influencing the overwhelming protectionist mood in the U.S. right now, what leverage does Canada really have?</p>
<p>Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty's argument that we should focus on "reciprocity" by reminding Americans that "they want access to our business" just doesn't seem like it would be all that persuasive to the average American who might see the logic in ensuring that American tax dollars aimed at America's recovery stay in America.</p>
<p>But while one might forgive the premiers for not providing viable solutions to matters clearly out of their control, less forgivable was their inability to come up with alternatives to the problems in the employment insurance system. It was more than a bit disappointing that the end-of-the-day communique offered little more than the suggestion that "the program should be simplified and streamlined to have fewer than the current 58 EI regions."</p>
<p>Even the carefully chosen words in the communique -- suggesting EI should provide Canadians with "equitable support regardless of where they live" instead of "equal support" -- speak to the deep regional divisions in this country on even the most basic issues.</p>
<p>In fairness, the premiers may have found a creative back-door approach to EI reform by also calling on the federal government to increase allocations to training.</p>
<p>And, as Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall alluded to when he suggested P.E.I. Premier Robert Ghiz "worked very hard" to ensure the interests of his constituents were represented, there are legitimate regional differences that need to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Less encouraging, however, was Wall's suggestion that it's the federal government's job to broker these issues -- not necessarily because it isn't the federal government's job, but because there was little from Human Resources Minister Diane Finlay on Thursday to suggest that the federal Conservatives will reform the program.</p>
<p>But lest anyone assume it was a completely unproductive day, it should be noted that the afternoon session ended early and Wall seemed positively giddy over progress he felt was made on his innovation agenda. He specifically mentioned progress made on addressing tax treatments that now result in the federal government clawing back research and development tax credits.</p>
<p>But with the employment insurance issue dominating the day, he said the premiers decided to hold release of a communique on the afternoon meeting until today so as to end the conference on a high note.</p>
<p>If so, it might just be something the premiers can agree on and something that they can do something about.</p>

<p>Governments won't get bogged down in jurisdictional squabbling on pandemic planning that could hold up the delivery of health services to Canadians, the country's premiers pledged Thursday.</p>
<p>"I don't think Canadians are very interested in a debate between levels of government about who's paying for what. They want to make sure there's preparedness, period," said Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, when asked about how government coffers might bear the costs associated with the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>The federal government shed some light on the issue of cost Thursday, announcing that Ottawa will order 50.4 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine currently under development and will pick up 60 per cent of the tab, with the provinces and territories covering the rest. The total cost is expected to be more than $400 million.</p>
<p>"We're pleased with the partnership (with the federal government) so far and we want to encourage it to continue," said Wall, chair of this year's Council of the Federation meeting taking place at Government House with premiers and territorial leaders.</p>
<p>Pandemic preparedness was a late addition to the agenda Thursday, after aboriginal leaders a day earlier emphasized the importance of flu planning.</p>
<p>Manitoba Premier Gary Doer, who entered the Council of the Federation meeting with H1N1 as one of his government's top priorities, agreed that the first priority of governments will be ensuring services are in place to deal with the pandemic.</p>
<p>"Our view is everybody is going to have to pay. The provinces have to deal with a tremendous amount of the cost in this and obviously the federal government has responsibilities," Doer said. "We're starting with the patient and the potential patient first."</p>
<p>In addition to antivirals and vaccines, other considerations include N95 masks that are more expensive than existing masks in medical units and the pressure the pandemic could put on hospitals and home care, Doer said.</p>
<p>Doer said Manitoba has budgeted a minimum of $50 million to deal with H1N1, and he expects the final tally will be even higher.</p>
<p>In Saskatchewan, initial estimates have pegged that figure as high as high as $32 million.</p>
<p>"We're ordering vaccines we haven't even tested yet," Doer said.</p>
<p>This is what we have to do. The alternative of not ordering them is not acceptable."</p>
<p>Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach said if H1N1 hits some areas of the country harder than others, the provinces should be able to move medical professionals and medical equipment to help deal with the situation.</p>
<p>"First and foremost is the safety of the public and working collaboratively across the country through our public health officers to make sure that we are sharing the information, working through any issues that there may be," Stelmach said.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>A union representing Ontario nurses is asking Canada's top court to overturn a ruling that left those who contracted SARS unable to sue the provincial government over the deadly outbreak six years ago.</p>
<p>The Ontario Nurses' Association is asking the Supreme Court of Canada for an appeal of the May decision by Ontario's top court.</p>
<p>The ruling leaves nurses at risk as they care for patients during the current swine flu pandemic, as well as other outbreaks of potentially deadly diseases, the union said.</p>
<p>So far, 63 Canadians have died after contracting the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>"The decision is particularly disturbing in the context of we're now into the next pandemic," said Elizabeth McIntyre, a lawyer representing the nurses and their families.</p>
<p>"We are going to be relying on the nurses to be there on the front line."</p>
<p>Several groups attempted to sue the province, alleging the government put economic interests ahead of public safety during the SARS outbreak which claimed 44 lives in the Toronto area.</p>
<p>But the Ontario Court of Appeal said the claims did not have legal grounds to proceed, and dismissed the lawsuits.</p>

</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK   </div>

<div>525 words</div><div>7 August 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Every Canadian in the country will be able to get at least one shot of the swine flu vaccine, federal health officials said yesterday as they announced an order is to be placed for 50.4 million doses.</p>
<p>"This will ensure sufficient vaccine is available to immunize every Canadian who needs and wants protection from the H1N1 virus," Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>The order, worth more than $400 million, will be placed "soon" with <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, the minister said. The federal government is picking up 60 per cent of the tab, while the provinces and territories will cover the rest.</p>
<p>David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said the results of clinical trials, predicted to get under way in September, will determine whether one dose or two will be required for those who receive the vaccine.</p>
<p>Ordering 50.4 million doses means there will be enough vaccine for one dose for 100 per cent of the population and enough for two doses for 75 per cent of the population, Butler-Jones said. It is anticipated that only one dose will be required, he said.</p>
<p>"We are encouraging people to be immunized and we know at the same time that not everybody will chose to do so," he said.</p>
<p>In the very rare scenario that everyone in the country wants the vaccine and everyone needs two doses of it, more could be ordered, he said.</p>
<p>"Nobody will be left behind," said Butler-Jones, who added vaccine production "remains on target" and that immunization campaigns should begin in November.</p>
<p>"We are working closely with our supplier to remove any impediments that might delay vaccine production, testing and distribution, but we are not prepared to cut corners where safety is involved," he said.</p>
<p>Earlier yesterday, the World Health Organization emphasized the safety of vaccines and said it wants to reassure the public that the speed at which the vaccine is being developed and tested is not compromising safety.</p>
<p>Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO director of the initiative for vaccine research, said in a conference call that minor side-effects of a vaccine are to be expected, including nausea and fever, and that "there is no doubt" that in any large-scale vaccination program there will be instances of severe adverse reactions.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of those will not be associated at all with a vaccine that is given," Kieny said.</p>
<p>"Regulatory authorities in all countries will monitor very closely all signals of adverse events and will immediately try to decipher ... whether these side-effects are linked to the vaccine or just coincidental," Kieny said.</p>
<p>The health organization said at least five countries - China, Australia, Britain, Germany and the United States - have started clinical trials of vaccines.</p>
<p>She outlined how regulatory agencies in various countries are fast-tracking the approval and licensing of vaccines and said that the full process, from development of the vaccine to making it available, usually takes five to six months.</p>
<p>"We are on track with that," she said.</p>

</p>
<p>As the dean of provincial premiers, Manitoba's Gary Doer is amply qualified to characterize the nature of their annual summer get-togethers.</p>
<p>"Every meeting we have, it's typified as hot air," Doer sighed upon arrival, standing in the rotunda of the Saskatchewan legislature with -- fittingly, when the subject is rhetorical fulmination -- a bust of native son John Diefenbaker looming over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Most often, the sneer refers to the gassy vapidity of the sessions. Occasionally, it covers the rhetorical jets aimed at Ottawa.</p>
<p>This year, however, things are different.</p>
<p>As they opened the Council of the Federation yesterday, Canada's premiers had an uncharacteristically meaty agenda and unusually kind words for their own federal government.</p>
<p>Instead, the most heated blasts were aimed at the United States and the Buy America initiatives there that threaten Canadian access to those markets.</p>
<p>One after another, the premiers took to the microphone to, in the case of Quebec's Jean Charest, warn of "the test" before America to match its actions with good intentions.</p>
<p>"The American administration has not been up to the rhetoric that they've (spouted,)" he said. "(U.S.) President (Barack) Obama made a commitment that they would live up to the world trade rules and they haven't.</p>
<p>"If they cannot, on this issue, come to an agreement with their major trading partner, their ally, their friend, their neighbour, then what does that say about the Americans' attitude worldwide? I think this is a test for them."</p>
<p>Saskatchewan's Brad Wall said Canada has "other options in terms of customers."</p>
<p>Both Dalton McGuinty and Nova Scotia newcomer Darrell Dexter urged the United States to show "enlightened self-interest" and recognize the millions of U.S. jobs dependent on trade with Canada.</p>
<p>In all, it was the sort of hot complaint usually aimed at other regions or addressed to Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>But, this year, Ottawa received considerable support and understanding from the provinces.</p>
<p>Doer said: "We don't want to make unreasonable demands on the federal government."</p>
<p>Part of this, of course, was his hard-won knowledge of where federal deficits eventually come to roost.</p>
<p>"We found in the past, when the deficits got too high in Ottawa, what was cut ... was health-care and post-secondary and welfare budgets ... at the end of the day, we'll all pay for it."</p>
<p>What the council does seem to find, year by year, is that the road to a federal administration frequently seen as inaccessible and unresponsive now leads through the premiers.</p>
<p>Organized labour, nurses associations, environmental groups and aboriginal leaders all made the case for the provinces to carry their briefs.</p>
<p>While the most visible of protesters at the conference were environmental activists -- taking out a full-page ad in the local paper denouncing Alberta's Ed Stelmach for climate-change intransigence and mounting street demos calling Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Stelmach and Wall "climate criminals" -- the focus of this year's talks were on economic matters and, as the first order of business, confronting a feared second wave of the H1N1 virus this fall.</p>
<p>As Wall said in welcoming premiers to the Prairies: "The list is always longer than what any government is able to do."</p>
<p>Before they sweep out of town this weekend to make way for the Regina Folk Festival, the premiers were also to discuss proposed national standards for employment insurance, review stimulus spending of levels unimaginable when they met a year ago and consider a proposal championed yesterday by McGuinty for a national summit on pensions.</p>
<p>As for the Americans, when it comes to scorching air flows, they should probably just be happy Newfoundland's Danny Williams was a no-show this year.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Making the business case for pandemic preparation now; Many Canadian companies have not taken steps to protect themselves</b>
</div><div>Amin Mawani   </div>
<div>Freelance</div>
<div>778 words</div><div>7 August 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>For the first time in 41 years, the World Health Organization officially declared a global pandemic based on the spread of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus--also known as "swine flu." While Mexico was the epicentre for the outbreak, Canada now has more than its fair share of cases. So far, per capita, Canada is the country in the world hit hardest by the pandemic (H1N1) 2009.</p>
<p>Just weeks after the pandemic (H1N1)2009 virus began to emerge, risk managers from some of Canada's largest corporations participated in a roundtable discussion on pandemic planning because they understood that preparedness was critical to the health of their organizations'bottom line.</p>
<p>The timing was coincidental as the date had been set months in advance, yet the topic was more relevant than ever. Representing Canada's major industries and regions, executives shared best practices about how corporate Canada should best prepare for an influenza pandemic. Regardless of which region of the country they came from, the 2003 SARS experience was fresh in their minds. SARS resulted in 44 deaths across the country and a $2-billion loss to the economy (or three percentage points of GDP that quarter). The death toll from the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in its mild form has already exceeded the SARS total.</p>
<p>A more severe strain could keep many more employees and customers away from businesses and erode corporate sales and profits.</p>
<p>For Canadian companies, the biggest cost associated with an influenza pandemic would be employee absenteeism. It is estimated that 15 to 30 per cent of employees would stay home during a pandemic due to illness, family-care responsibilities and fear of being infected at work. Since employees are the principal profit drivers in most corporations, prolonged absenteeism could cripple operations and disrupt global supply chains.</p>
<p>As in the credit crisis, the fallout would likely spread rapidly due to the interconnectedness of the world's economies.</p>
<p>The good news is employee absenteeism may be controlled to a large extent with adequate planning.</p>
<p>The corporations at the roundtable indicated that some of their current practices for pandemic preparedness included ongoing communications with employees, hand hygiene, travel restrictions and access to sanitizers and related supplies for equipment handling.</p>
<p>Some companies already had plans to institute more liberal sick leave policies, work-at-home policies and staggered working hours in the event of a more severe outbreak.</p>
<p>Others were considering social distancing strategies, personal protective equipment and antiviral stockpiles.</p>
<p>But the bad news is many Canadian companies have not taken steps to protect themselves.</p>
<p>A survey done last month by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters Association shows only 64 per cent of Canadian corporations have a business continuity plan, and even those would be at varying levels of completeness.</p>
<p>Competitive advantage</p>
<p>There are many benefits associated with pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>The companies that can prevent absenteeism during a pandemic will be well-positioned to take market share from those that can't--a situation that may be hard to reverse once the panic subsides.</p>
<p>They also may enjoy higher stock prices and cheaper credit because financial markets tend to reward firms with steady profits and cash flows.</p>
<p>Even if a pandemic never occurs, suppliers with a reputation for being prepared may have a competitive edge. Customers care about reliability and will value a supplier that has a plan for weathering volatility and supply chain disruptions.</p>
<p>If the probability of a pandemic is significant and the adverse impact can be alleviated, why aren't more companies racing to prepare?</p>
<p>To some, pandemic preparedness may seem like a logistical challenge. Other firms may be experiencing a liquidity crunch because of the credit crisis, while still others may have a shortage of employees who are capable of coming up with a plan for weathering a health crisis.</p>
<p>Some companies may think the entire industry will suffer equally. That's a risky assumption, given that some businesses are known to have contingency plans in place already.</p>
<p>Canadian corporations cannot afford to be complacent when it comes to pandemic preparedness --especially because the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan indicates Canadian companies cannot rely on governments to protect their employees and their business.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Strained friendship tests continent's 'Three Amigos'; Obama has already hinted he will withdraw support for Security and Prosperity Partnership</b>
</div><div>Barbara Yaffe   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>580 words</div><div>7 August 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The so-called "Three Amigos" may be just a little less palsy than usual when they convene in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Saturday for the annual North American Leaders' Summit.</p>
<p>The gathering, a ritual since 2005, tends to be an all-smiles-and-handshakes affair that celebrates cosy relations on the continent and sets priorities for trilateral cooperation.</p>
<p>But this year, in the bustling town that's considered Mexico's Silicon Valley, the trio of leaders -- when off-camera -- probably will exchange notes on a few awkward bits of North American business.</p>
<p>U.S. President Barack Obama, attending his first such summit, already has hinted he will withdraw American support for the four-year-old Security and Prosperity Partnership.</p>
<p>The project was aimed at harmonizing North American regulations for business in order to smooth cross-border trade flows.</p>
<p>But in both Canada and the U.S., the SPP, spearheaded by teams of national business leaders, was harshly criticized for its lack of transparency, and portrayed by some as a secret plan to integrate North America.</p>
<p>The SPP been stalled since George W. Bush left office.</p>
<p>A prominent opponent of the SPP, the Council of Canadians, says on its website, "Commentators now acknowledge that public opposition to deep integration talks have made the SPP politically poisonous."</p>
<p>Accordingly, Obama is expected to lead the way in renaming the venture and enlarging its membership to include labour, environmental and human rights groups.</p>
<p>Another topic that probably will be bandied about is the July 14 decision by Canada to impose a visa requirement on Mexican visitors.</p>
<p>The number of Mexicans seeking asylum since 2005 has tripled, translating into heavy costs and delays for Canada's immigration system.</p>
<p>The move, from a continental perspective, is controversial. The Waterloo, Ont.-based Centre for International Governance Innovation, which has leading Canada-U.S. commentators such as political scientists Stephen Clarkson and Chris Sands on its board, says the gesture is considered by some to be "one of the most perplexing, and possibly damaging, foreign policy decisions the government has taken in some time."</p>
<p>It states further that the visa requirement makes Canada's Americas policy look self-interested and "suppresses the sense of a real North American community."</p>
<p>That said, the U.S. has long had a visa requirement for Mexican visitors.</p>
<p>A third controversial issue that has surfaced lately in relation to the continent is whether the U.S. should be treating its northern and southern borders the same, neglecting the fact that dealings with Canada are far less problematic than with Mexico.</p>
<p>A report in July by the Washington, D.C.-based Brookings Institution criticized Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano's preferred policy of standardizing policies for the two borders.</p>
<p>Beyond these thornier topics, Obama, Stephen Harper and Felipe Calderon are expected to chat about the economy, Buy America legislative provisions, national security and crime, environment and climate change, energy security, measures to deal with the H1N1 virus and the recent coup in Honduras.</p>
<p>The leaders' summits last only a couple of days and have their greatest value in enabling the three nationally preoccupied leaders to become more comfortable with one another and their respective priority issues.</p>
<p>Obama, since becoming president in January, has met once with Harper and several times with Calderon.</p>

</div><div>James Wood   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>940 words</div><div>7 August 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Canada's premiers agree the employment insurance system needs to be streamlined and modernized, but they failed to come to an agreement Thursday on how to accomplish the plan.</p>
<p>The stumbling block as leaders met at a Council of the Federation meeting in Regina continued to be the issue of changing how many hours some Canadians must work before qualifying for benefits.</p>
<p>Western premiers had entered the meeting calling for three tiers for EI eligibility based on urban, rural and remote regions, while Ontario's Dalton McGuinty called for a single national standard.</p>
<p>Leaders of Atlantic provinces with high unemployment levels, meanwhile, had expressed concern about any potential dilution of the system.</p>
<p>The joint communique issued Thursday called for a simplification and reduction of the existing 58 EI regions, which vary widely in terms of how much time an individual has to work to qualify for benefits.</p>
<p>It also stressed that reforms must not reduce access or benefits from current standards and called for the federal government to significantly increase the amount of funding for training programs.</p>
<p>While the premiers called for EI to provide "equitable," if not equal, support to all Canadians, they did not settle on how many regions or tiers should be implemented or what hour thresholds should be used.</p>
<p>"First of all, that's part of the federal government's job, I think," said Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, chairman of the meeting.</p>
<p>"It is part of the job of provinces to say, in a very constructive way and I think quite specifically,'We've come up with a consensus here,' notwithstanding the fact...that there are going to be different priorities when it comes to employment insurance or any federal program. That is just the nature of the federation."</p>
<p>However, Diane Finley, human resources and skills development minister in the federal Conservative government, gave the proposals a non-committal reception.</p>
<p>While she expressed a willingness to listen to the premiers, she said the federal government is already putting record amounts into training and said the EI program as it exists now has been extremely responsive to the economic turmoil that has battered the Canadian economy.</p>
<p>'Open to ideas'</p>
<p>"We're open to ideas that are reasonable, that are going to help Canadians at an affordable price. We have to recognize that we're spending a lot of extra money on employment insurance during these tough times. We have to make sure also that when we come out of this recession that we're not burdening employers and employees with huge increases in payroll taxes," said Finley, adding she would need to see more of the provinces' proposals to determine whether they fit the bill.</p>
<p>Reform of the EI system is one of the most contentious issues in national politics. While a federal election was avoided by a June agreement between the Conservative government and Opposition Liberals to form a federal working group to study the program, there has been more sparring than consensus between the two parties.</p>
<p>Wall said he believes the premiers' EI recommendations will be a significant spur to the federal government to reform the system.</p>
<p>Premiers also called for the federal government to host a national summit on retirement income in 2010, bringing together provinces, territories, the federal government and other interested groups and experts to discuss options for improving saving options for Canadians.</p>
<p>"There are some options out there," Wall said. "In our province, it's a modest provision perhaps, but for about 23 years we've been offering the Saskatchewan Pension Plan as a supplement to those who may not be able to access a workplace plan. There might be improvements to existing pension plans that can come from a summit," he said.</p>
<p>The premiers also promised that governments won't get bogged down in jurisdictional squabbling on pandemic planning that could hold up the delivery of health services to Canadians.</p>
<p>"I don't think Canadians are very interested in a debate between levels of government about who's paying for what. They want to make sure there's preparedness, period," said Wall, when asked how government coffers will cover the costs associated with the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>Pandemic preparedness was a late addition to the Council of the Federation agenda, after aboriginal leaders meeting with premiers and territorial leaders a day earlier emphasized the importance of flu planning.</p>
<p>The vaccine for H1N1 is not yet ready, although the World Health Organization said manufacturers are on track to have one ready by September.</p>
<p>Canadian federal health officials will be ordering 50.4 million doses of the vaccine, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Thursday.</p>
<p>Manitoba Premier Gary Doer, who entered the meeting with H1N1 as his government's top priority, agreed the first priority of governments will be ensuring services are in place to deal with the pandemic.</p>
<p>However, he said that eventually there will be broader discussions with the federal government going beyond just the cost of vaccines. Dealing with the flu will mean a cost to all government coffers, he said.</p>
<p>The premiers were also talking tough on trade Thursday, publicly backing the federal government's efforts to fight "Buy American" legislation in the United States.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu victim fourth to die in city; Woman, 55, already had 'significant' medical condition</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>612 words</div><div>7 August 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>A fourth person has died in Ottawa from complications related to the H1N1 swine flu.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old woman had "significant underlying conditions" before she was hospitalized with the flu, said Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's medical officer of health.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, one patient with the novel flu virus remained in hospital. So far, 361 people in the city have tested positive for the H1N1 virus, and 69 of them have been hospitalized, though the authorities are no longer routinely testing people who exhibit flu symptoms.</p>
<p>Another nine cases of flu-like symptoms were reported this week among members of the Governor General's Foot Guards, prompting Canadian Forces medical personnel to place the ill members in isolation at the Carleton University residence where they were staying. None has been formally diagnosed as having the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Public-health officials have also been monitoring an unknown type of "respiratory outbreak" at three nursing homes over the past week as part of a heightened flu alert.</p>
<p>Typically, nursing homes are required to report such outbreaks any time they see two or more cases of illness within 48 hours. The reporting requirement is designed to give public-health officials early warning about potentially infectious bugs that could spread rapidly among the frail elderly and cause life-threatening complications.</p>
<p>In one of the three nursing homes affected, as many as 11 cases of respiratory infections were detected, prompting public-health officials to launch an investigation into infection-control practices at the facility and order tests for some ailing residents. So far, none of the residents has tested positive for the H1N1 virus, and it's unclear what type of microbe might have caused the outbreaks, Levy said.</p>
<p>While the outbreaks have since stopped at two of the three nursing homes, those facilities are still watched closely as a precaution.</p>
<p>"We're monitoring whether or not this is more than the usual," Levy said. "We tend to see small numbers in the summer ... so we're watching closely from the point of view of, 'Is this a canary in the mine?' "</p>
<p>In the meantime, public-health officials say they have a "robust" surveillance system in place to track what is expected to be a resurgence of the flu in the fall.</p>
<p>Since the start of the H1N1 outbreak in late April, Ontario has moved from a heightened state of surveillance, with doctors initially ordering mass testing of patients for the H1N1 virus, back to a routine system of tracking the flu based on a weekly roundup of crude indicators. The roundup includes reports of flu cases from a sampling of representative (or "sentinel") physicians, plus reports from regional microbiology laboratories, which identify the strains of flu that are circulating in the community. Reports of outbreaks from nursing homes and hospitals are also part of the provincial flu-tracking system.</p>
<p>This fall, public-health officials will continue to ask schools to notify them any time more than 10 per cent of their students are absent, a threshold that has been lowered from 15 per cent since the start of the H1N1 pandemic, said Dr. Nadine Sicard, the city's associate medical officer of health. Such absenteeism rates would trigger an investigation by public-health officials into a possible outbreak.</p>
<p>Sicard said such methods of monitoring flu had been in place for several years and remained effective to deal with the H1N1 virus, at least for the time being. "If the situation changes, for sure we will be reassessing our strategies for surveillance," he said.</p>

<p>Mayor Larry O'Brien returned to Ottawa City Hall on Thursday, saying little except that he was eager to get back to work.</p>
<p>O'Brien pulled up in a dark sedan at about 9 a.m. and briefly chatted with reporters before walking to his office in the heritage wing of the municipal building.</p>
<p>"I'm keen to get back to work," a smiling O'Brien said. "I'm very anxious to get back to work. I have a lot of catching up to do."</p>
<p>O'Brien said it would take him two or three days to get back up to speed on the hundreds of city issues that find their way into the mayor's office.</p>
<p>He spent the day in meetings with officials, starting with Osgoode Councillor Doug Thompson, who was the acting mayor for the past few weeks, and West Carleton-March Councillor Eli El-Chantiry, who is deputy mayor.</p>
<p>Then he met with city manager Kent Kirkpatrick, going over preparations for the upcoming Association of Municipalities of Ontario conference in Ottawa and other issues such as funding for the city's proposed new master transit plan, the redevelopment proposal for Lansdowne Park and the recent flooding in the west end.</p>
<p>O'Brien was acquitted on charges of influence-peddling Wednesday after a long trial over allegations that he had offered an opponent for the mayor's job a spot on the National Parole Board in exchange for that candidate's withdrawal from the 2006 election. Justice Douglas Cunningham's strong judgment in the mayor's favour was welcomed by a relieved O'Brien and many members of city council, who said O'Brien had a chance to turn a new page in his mayoralty.</p>
<p>The mayor, who has been on a leave of absence from City Hall since May 1, posted these observations on his website:</p>
<p>"The last few months have been difficult and exhausting and I want to extend my thanks to you, the citizens of Ottawa, for your warm wishes of support and encouragement.</p>
<p>"While I regret that my family and I had to go through this painful ordeal, it was very important for me to defend my name and to have justice and the truth come out.</p>
<p>"Now it is time to turn this unhappy page and move forward. And that is exactly what I have done."</p>
<p>Though there are some hot issues at City Hall, including the poorly handled flooding in the west end and concern about the global swine flu pandemic, most councillors are on vacation. City council and its committees are on an extended summer break.</p>
<p>One of the first things the mayor must do is find a new chief of staff to replace Eric Lamoureux.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>WestJet scales back growth plans</b>
</div><div>Gina Teel   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>763 words</div><div>7 August 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p><span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. is trimming its capacity growth expectations and negotiating to adjust its aircraft delivery schedule after second-quarter profit plunged 66 per cent.</p>
<p>WestJet, Canada's second-largest airline, said these and other measures will help it navigate the short-term environment to achieve its long-term growth goals, as the carrier endures what it called possibly the toughest economic environment ever experienced by the airline industry.</p>
<p>Sean Durfy, WestJet's president and chief executive, said the impact of the recession on the airline industry has been worse than that of 9/11 or SARS.</p>
<p>The H1N1 epidemic didn't help, either.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, our consumer-driven economy isn't a pretty place for any discretionary spend company, as consumers are deploying the 'hunker down and wait out the storm'mentality," he told analysts in a conference call Thursday.</p>
<p>Competitive pricing on airfares to stimulate demand also bit into profits.</p>
<p>Revenue per available seat mile, a key indicator of revenue growth, plunged 15.4 per cent year over year, which Durfy called "an incredible drop."</p>
<p>Fortunately, cost per available seat mile was also down by 14 per cent, he said, driven by lower fuel costs.</p>
<p>This helped WestJet post second-quarter financial results that beat market expectations.</p>
<p>Durfy later told reporters that although forward bookings over the past six weeks are holding steady at bottom and the airline is now looking for a recovery, the issue is when that will happen.</p>
<p>"And is there any other shoe to drop in terms of economic difficulties? And I fear that, I must tell you, because I don't think this is over yet," he told the Herald.</p>
<p>Management expects 2010 to be another difficult year for discretionary spending, and for the industry to recover in 2011.</p>
<p>Meantime, WestJet is lowering its aircraft utilization rates, and adjusting its schedule to more profitable flying.</p>
<p>This will lower WestJet's previously planned third-quarter 2009 capacity growth to a decline of between one and two per cent.</p>
<p>WestJet also shaved its full year capacity growth again, to between two and three per cent, down from three per cent.</p>
<p>"We're also in negotiations with <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and our leasing company to adjust our aircraft delivery schedule over the next several years," Durfy said.</p>
<p>There will be no impact on aircraft deliveries in 2009. Further details weren't provided.</p>
<p>Airlines analyst Rick Erickson called the move prudent management, and one that shows WestJet is doing as good a job at managing the downturn as it does managing growth.</p>
<p>"I don't think WestJet's talking about cancelling, but they certainly are thinking about deferring the arrival of new aircraft," he said.</p>
<p>WestJet launched four new destinations in the quarter and announced a 20 per cent increase in the airline's North American footprint.</p>
<p>WestJet's Sabre reservation system, which will provide expanded functionality for code-sharing, among other new opportunities, is on target for fourth-quarter implementation.</p>
<p>WestJet reported second-quarter net earnings of$9.2 million, or seven cents per diluted share, compared with $26.8 million and 21 cents per share in the year earlier quarter.</p>
<p>(The 2008 comparatives have been restated due to a change in accounting policy.)</p>
<p>Revenue was $531 million, compared with $616 million last year.</p>
<p>The carrier ended the quarter with $739 million in cash on the books, compared with $812 million.</p>
<p>Load factor during the quarter fell 3.4 percentage points to 76.1 per cent. Capacity, measured in available seat miles, rose 1.9 per cent to 4.315 billion. Revenue per available seat mile slipped 15.4 per cent to 12.31 cents.</p>
<p>Vito Culmone, WestJet's chief financial officer, said the carrier isn't expecting any improvement in the revenue-per-available-seat-mile numbers for the balance of 2009, given economic conditions.</p>
<p>In a research note to clients, airlines analyst Cameron Doerksen of Versant Partners Inc. wrote the revenue outlook, "while not surprising, is worse than the nine per cent Q3 RASM drop we were forecasting."</p>
<p>Also Wednesday, WestJet released its July traffic. The month saw a load factor of 76.4 per cent, down 3.3 percentage points from a year ago.</p>
<p>WestJet shares ended the day up 36 cents, or nearly 3.37 per cent, to $11.05 on the TSX.</p>
<p>The shares have lost 16 per cent this year.</p>

<p>WATERLOO - Savvas Chamberlain, who founded the high-tech company <span class="companylink">Dalsa Corp</span>. nearly three decades ago, is stepping down as chief technology officer and executive chair of the company. However, Chamberlain will remain as chair of the board in a non-management status, the company announced Wednesday. The changes take effect Oct. 12. "Although I am stepping down as CTO, with my role as chair of the board and as a significant shareholder, I look forward to the opportunity to continue serving the company and its stakeholders," Chamberlain said in a release. Chamberlain founded the company, which makes digital imaging products, in 1980.</p>

<p>EDMONTON - Second-quarter profits at engineering and design firm <span class="companylink">Stantec Inc</span>. (TSX:STN) edged up to $22.3 million from year-ago $22.1 million as revenue rose 13 per cent. The Edmonton-based company said its earnings amounted to 49 cents per share, up a penny from the prior-year period.

<p>Thomson Reuters remained strong during difficult quarter</p>
<p>NEW YORK - Information services company Thomson Reuters (TSX:TRI) said Thursday that its profits and revenues increased in the second quarter despite difficult economic conditions that squeezed many of its customers. The New York-based company keeps its books in U.S. dollars and files financial results in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards rather than Canadian GAAP measures. Thomson Reuters reported net income of $325 million US or 38 cents per share for the quarter ended June 30, more than twice as high as year-earlier profits of $154 million or 19 cents per share.</p>

The Calgary-based air carrier reported a profit of $9.2 million or seven cents per share for the quarter ended June 30, down sharply from year-earlier profits of $26.8 million or 21 cents per share. Quarterly revenue declined 14 per cent to $531.2 million from $616 million recorded the year before. WestJet chief executive Sean Durfy said the declines were largely due to low passenger demand driven by weak economic conditions.</p>

<div>560 words</div><div>7 August 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Ten to 12 children at a local summer camp were infected with the H1N1 virus last month, Waterloo Region's associate medical officer of health said Thursday.</p>
<p>None of the children, aged eight to 12, left the camp while they were ill. They were mild cases and all the children recovered within a couple of days before parents and health officials even knew the diagnosis, said Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang.</p>
<p>The number of children who fell ill was less than 20 per cent of the total number of campers.</p>
<p>Wang declined to name the camp. "We don't do that, because there's no risk to the public," she said.</p>
<p>It's the first outbreak of this disease at a local summer camp.</p>
<p>The camp may not be named, but it's not the Kitchener YMCA, one of the largest and best-known summer camp operators locally, said agency chief executive John Haddock. The Y has taken extra precautions this year.</p>
<p>"We take the kids' temperatures when they come to camp," Haddock said. If the child isn't well, he or she is sent home with a promise that the week away will be replaced once the child recovers.</p>
<p>"The parents are OK with that," he said.</p>
<p>Across Canada, another person died of the virus Thursday, which has reached pandemic proportions. The death toll across the country is now 63 people.</p>
<p>Federal officials announced yesterday that the government will buy 50.4 million doses of the vaccine against the virus - enough for every Canadian who wants to be protected.</p>
<p>"This investment reflects the unique circumstances of the situation as well as the gravity," said federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>The vaccine will be manufactured in Ste-Foy, Que., by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>. It will be ready in late October or early November.</p>
<p>Officials aren't sure how much of the vaccine everyone will need. Studies are still determining that some people may only need one dose, others will need two or more.</p>
<p>Older people are less vulnerable to H1N1. The risk is higher for younger people, aboriginal Canadians, and those whose bodies are fighting other illnesses.</p>
<p>Wang said local health officials have been told to plan for an "intensified" flu season this fall, with more demand for both the regular flu shot and the H1N1 vaccine, which could require more than one shot.</p>
<p>Discussions are continuing on how to provide the extra shots, who will give them and where clinics will be held.</p>
<p>But viruses are tricky, and don't always behave the way one might expect.</p>
<p>Even as the health-care apparatus gears up for mass vaccines, there are signs that the tide may have turned, Wang said.</p>
<p>"What we're seeing in the last few weeks is that the indicators have been dropping," she said.</p>
<p>There are fewer diagnoses at doctors' offices and fewer people being sent to hospital with the disease, she said.</p>
<p>Federal officials have been planning for the same possibility. If it turns out that Canadians don't need 50.4 million doses of the vaccine, it could turn back part of the order from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>.</p>
<p>This would allow the company to fill other countries' orders sooner, said Dr. David Butler-Jones, head of the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Premiers talk EI, pensions and flu</b>
</div><div>By Jennifer Graham   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>459 words</div><div>7 August 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>REGINA</p>
<p>Canada's premiers are calling for an overhaul of the employment insurance program, but they haven't completely agreed on what changes should be made.</p>
<p>The premiers, who are meeting this week, say the program needs to be reformed to help more Canadians especially as the country struggles to pull out of the recession. As part of the reform, the federal government must increase the money put toward training, they said.</p>
<p>"We need to modernize the employment insurance program and modernization has to include a bigger emphasis on training," said Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall who hosted the meeting in Regina. "Premiers are saying . . . let's lift the ceiling on the amount that can go into training. This is obviously an urgent need, too."</p>
<p>Among the changes, the premiers say EI should provide equitable support to Canadians regardless of where they live. They also want the current 58 EI regions - each with different thresholds to qualify - reduced.</p>
<p>The western premiers put forward a proposal that the 58 thresholds be reduced to just three, for urban, rural and remote areas.</p>
<p>However, Ontario's Dalton McGuinty has said he'd like to see a single national eligibility standard. McGuinty argued that residents in areas hit hard by the recession, such as Windsor, likely wouldn't see much help in the three-category proposal.</p>
<p>The premiers failed to reach a consensus on the regions issue.</p>
<p>The premiers are also jointly calling on the federal government to hold a national summit on pensions amid concerns that many Canadians are facing retirement without adequate income.</p>
<p>McGuinty said a recent study has shown that by 2030, two-thirds of Canadians will not have enough retirement income to pay for their necessary living expenses. It's a national challenge that warrants a national conversation, he said.</p>
<p>"This is an issue that is in some ways independent of this global recession, but the recession has exacerbated or has highlighted some of the challenges associated with folks who don't have an adequate level of retirement income," said McGuinty.</p>
<p>McGuinty said governments may have to create more incentives to persuade people to sock away money.</p>
<p>While employment insurance talks dominated the afternoon, the premiers spent time earlier in the day talking about flu. They briefly said they're in a good position to fight a resurgence of H1N1 expected this fall.</p>
<p>Wall says he will call Prime Minister Stephen Harper on behalf of all the premiers and advise him what they think the priorities should be - one of which includes educating people about the need to get inoculated against the H1N1 virus .</p>
<p>The premiers will meet again today and are expected to discuss trade issues.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Canada expects 50.4 million doses of H1N1 vaccine to be enough to immunize everyone who needs and wants a shot in the arm to help protect against the global swine flu pandemic.</p>
<p>The federal government will soon place its order with pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline Inc. and has decided to help out provinces and territories by footing 60 per cent of the $403 million bill.</p>
<p>Neala Barton, spokeswoman for Ontario Health Minister David Caplan, said the province welcomed the federal leadership. "There are significant costs associated with managing an outbreak," she said.</p>
<p>Chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said the order would cover two doses for about 75 per cent of the population or one dose to everyone in Canada followed up by a second dose to about half the population if needed.</p>
<p>He said experience with seasonal flu and the use of adjuvant to stretch out the supply means it is more likely the majority of people will require a single dose. Butler-Jones also said government polling shows up to 60 per cent of Canadians would want to be immunized for H1N1. "This gives us a considerable margin of error," he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, said the province would get 19.5 million doses.</p>

<p>Two years ago, Mexican President Felipe Calderon arrived in Montebello, Que., for the Three Amigos summit with then-U. S. president George W. Bush and Stephen Harper. "Buenos Dias, Felipe," said the Prime Minister as he greeted Mr. Calderon.</p>
<p>Relations between the two were warm. Both are economists by training, with children of similar age. The Calderons spent the weekend prior to the NAFTA summit with the Harpers at the Prime Minister's official summer residence, Harrington Lake, where Mr. Harper's wife, Laureen, taught the Mexican President how to drive a motor boat.</p>
<p>Such cosyness is likely to be notable by its absence when the two men reconvene, along with U. S. President Barack Obama, in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p>Mr. Calderon is understood to be deeply unhappy at the Canadian government's decision to demand that Mexican nationals travelling to Canada now require visas -- a move aimed at stopping the growing number of fraudulent refugee claims by Mexicans.</p>
<p>Information is only now beginning to emerge that as damaging as the decision itself was the way in which it was communicated to the Mexicans by the Harper government.</p>
<p>Sources suggest that when Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon left Mexico City on 20 April, having discussed the issue with his Mexican counterpart, it was agreed to set up a working group to study the refugee problem.</p>
<p>The next time it came up was on May 1, when Mr. Calderon called Mr. Harper to thank Canada for the help it offered Mexico during the swine flu crisis. At the end of the call, without having given Mexican diplomats any prior notice, Mr. Harper is said to have dropped the bombshell that his government intended</p>
<p>to impose visa requirements on Mexican tourists.</p>
<p>"It was a bucket of cold water," said one Mexican official. "It was very, very badly received in Mexico."</p>
<p>It can scarcely have been received much more warmly by Mr. Cannon, who was obliged to travel to Mexico City on May 19 to defend a decision that he appears to have had no hand in making.</p>
<p>The Mexicans argued that the same results could be achieved by having Canadian customs officials pre-clear travellers in Mexican airports. The country's Attorney-General also concluded that there was a sound basis for prosecuting companies that actively promote refugee claims in Mexico.</p>
<p>But Mr. Cannon was obliged to brush away all such suggestions, pointing out that Cabinet had already pronounced on the issue and he was powerless to reverse the measure.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the trickle of Mexican refugee claims was in danger of turning into a flood. Mexicans are the number one asylum seekers in Canada, with cases tripling to 9,400 from four years ago, with 90% of those claims being rejected.</p>
<p>Alykhan Velshi, director of communications for Immigration Minister Jason Kenney, pointed out that the visa requirement has had the desired effect -- since its imposition on July 16, there have been only 20 refugee claims at a time when the system might have expected 40 a day.</p>
<p>He said that the problems experienced by travellers have been exaggerated, pointing out that 11,000 applications have been received since July 16, and more than 10,000 approved.</p>
<p>But the ham-fisted way in which the issue has been handled has caused harm that may be irreparable to our relations with a country that has been one of our closest friends.</p>
<p>"There isn't a good atmosphere for Harper in Mexico right now," said the Mexican official.</p>
<p>One presumes the same can be said for most other Canadians. Things are so bad that public opinion would hardly sour further if Mr. Harper stood up on Sunday and insulted national icon Salma Hayek.</p>
<p>The Conservatives downplay the idea that the visa requirement will hit a $24-billion trading relationship that is bigger than that which we have with France, Germany or the rest of Latin America combined.</p>
<p>But the Mexican official said he has already heard anecdotal evidence of Mexican businessmen by-passing Canada because they cannot afford to hand over their passports to the Canadian embassy for two weeks in order to receive a visa.</p>
<p>It seems apparent that Mr. Kenney pushed this misguided policy, either to pander to the Conservative base or to build his own right-wing credentials for a future leadership bid.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, his claim that there were no other options does not hold water. The policy should be reversed and Mr. Harper should invite Mr. Calderon back to Harrington Lake at the first opportunity.</p>

</p>
<p>The only surprising thing about the premiers' demand for immediate and meaningful co-operation on tackling the H1N1 virus is that it took so long in coming.</p>
<p>They issued this call to arms at this week's Council of the Federation meeting in Regina, where leaders of the provinces and territories tried to hash out solutions to the most pressing issues facing them: employment insurance, international trade and swine flu among them.</p>
<p>Canada should be preparing for an onslaught of the virus “as if there is an H1N1 truck coming around the corner,” Manitoba Premier Gary Doer said.</p>
<p>Mr. Doer rightly called on all levels of government to work collaboratively to prevent the pandemic from wreaking havoc.</p>
<p>Both he and Shawn Atleo, the newly elected Assembly of First Nations Grand Chief, called for a much needed focus on prevention and treatment on native reserves, which have been hit disproportionately by the flu. Overcrowding, geographic isolation and grossly inadequate health-care services and education have made for an illness-exacerbating cocktail.</p>
<p>On reserves, the fatal consequences of jurisdictional wrangling – provinces are responsible for health care while the federal government takes charge of reserves and disease prevention – are starkly underscored.</p>
<p>This virulent and dangerous strain of the flu virus was detected and started to spread globally in April; a pandemic was declared in June.</p>
<p>But a week into August, as a British laboratory makes breakthroughs in overcoming low vaccine yield and clinical trials get under way in Australia, Canada's various governments are only beginning to discuss how to work together to educate Canadians, protect health-care workers and prevent the most vulnerable from bearing the brunt of the disease.</p>
<p>The joint statements of support and co-operation made by the premiers this week were important. What is astonishing is that they did not come sooner.</p>
<p>Mr. Doer's metaphor is apt: A still largely unknown virus is veering around the corner toward the world's people – a multi-vehicle health-care pileup in the making.</p>
<p>This is no time for Canada to fall asleep at the wheel.</p>

<p>The first lesson for Manitoba students heading back to classes in a month will be how to limit the spread of the H1N1 flu virus, Manitoba's chief provincial public health officer said Thursday.</p>
<p>Dr. Joel Kettner said health officials are in the final stages of planning an educational blitz of elementary and high school students, teachers and parents to contain the anticipated second outbreak of the flu, expected to be more severe than the one this spring.</p>
<p>Also under consideration is a school-based flu vaccination program that may be launched as soon as an approved vaccine becomes available.</p>
<p>"We want the schools to be our eyes and ears because schools are often the first place we see evidence of influenza arriving in our community," Kettner said.</p>
<p>"Kids tend to be the initial spreaders for a variety of reasons. We first know that a particular strain of influenza has arrived and is significant by absenteeism."</p>
<p>Kettner also said schools must formulate continuity plans so that classes are not interrupted should teachers book off sick.</p>
<p>"All workplaces need to be having plans in place for (a flu outbreak), but schools in particular," he said, adding school will be closed only as a last resort.</p>
<p>"One thing we don't want to do is have a response or a prevention strategy that's worse than the disease itself. Our goal is to keep society running as fully as possible."</p>
<p>Kettner said information packets will be sent to schools in the province soon to allow teachers to be fully briefed on teaching their students about proper handwashing, to sneeze or cough into their upper arm and to stay home when sick.</p>
<p>"Our goal is that every able student and every parent would be aware," he said.</p>
<p>How widespread the second wave of the H1N1 virus will be this fall and winter is unknown, but Kettner said based on the initial outbreak in the spring, it does not appear the virus is as severe as first feared. Seven Manitobans died of flu complications. None was a school-age child.</p>
<p>He said a school-based flu vaccination program will depend on the availability of a vaccine. The first H1N1 vaccines will likely be approved by regulators in September, the World Health Organization said Thursday.</p>
<p>Kettner said public health officials are now determining who will be vaccinated first. Obvious choices are front-line health-care workers, people at high risk of catching the flu, teachers and school children.</p>
<p>"Ideally, if we had enough vaccine for everybody right now, we'd probably plan for administering a school-based vaccine program very early in the school year to try to get ahead of whenever this flu is going to re-emerge as a second wave.</p>
<p>"But given that we haven't had a school-age child die yet from this disease and that the hospitalization and intensive care rates being what they are, I'm not in a hurry to stick a needle in every child's arm in Manitoba of a vaccine that hasn't been adequately tested for safety and side- effects."</p>
<p>Last week, a panel of experts advised the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the first vaccinations should go to pregnant women, parents and contacts of children younger than six months, health care workers, children and young adults and non-elderly adults with chronic medical conditions.</p>
<p>bruce.owen@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Most kids safe,</p>
<p>medical chief says</p>
<p>FORTY-one children ages five to 18 were hospitalized with the H1N1 virus in the spring, Manitoba chief provincial public health officer Dr. Joel Kettner said.</p>
<p>What isn't known is the total number of children who had the flu last spring, he said, adding that a reasonable estimate is 10 per cent of Manitoba children had it.</p>
<p>Of children ages five to 12, one was admitted to a hospital intensive care unit.</p>
<p>Of children ages 13 to 18, three were admitted to intensive care.</p>
<p>Of the seven H1N1-related deaths in the spring, none was a child.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of children in these age groups who have had the flu have had relatively mild illness not requiring hospitalization," he said.</p>
<p>That means one in 5,000 kids who had the flu was admitted to ICU and one in 500 was hospitalized.</p>
<p>Kettner said the numbers show the risk to children of severe illness and death is low.</p>
<p>"Parents shouldn't be overly fearful of sending their kids to school," he said. "We expect them to get this flu, but the vast majority of them will have a mild illness."</p>

<p>More pandemic planning and education is needed to protect Native communities from the H1N1 flu outbreak expected to hit harder this fall, leaders of national aboriginal organizations said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Speaking after a closed-door meeting at the Saskatchewan legislature with Canada's premiers and territorial leaders, aboriginal leaders said H1N1 preparedness is a particular concern for remote and northern communities.</p>
<p>"We want to be part of the national plan and be included as to how we are going to reach the remote communities where there are no roads, no medical personnel and the southern personnel -- if their families get sick -- they will want to be home with their families," said Mary Simon, president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the national Inuit organization in Canada.</p>
<p>While governments are formulating plans to deal with H1N1, Simon said those plans need to be communicated to people.</p>
<p>"I think the problem that we have in our communities is that there is no public education going on, or very little of it," she said.</p>
<p>"From the grassroots level, I'm saying that a lot of people are concerned about what's going to happen to them if they get sick and they don't know (what plans are in place)."</p>
<p>Some First Nations communities in Manitoba saw several serious cases of the H1N1 flu in the spring, and there are concerns that Canada's aboriginal communities -- some of which face major issues around housing and drinking water -- could suffer disproportionately come flu season.</p>
<p>"While there are some good examples of First Nations having good plans in place, having the resources, using the resources that may be available to produce those plans, much more needs to be done," said Shawn Atleo, newly elected national chief of the Assembly of First Nations.</p>
<p>However, Atleo said he's confident those preparedness issues are being addressed and pledged that officials will follow up on the concerns raised at the meeting Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It was made clear even amongst the premiers that they're working on surge capacity, that there's a need to make sure that rural and isolated communities are particularly supported," he said.</p>
<p>"We leave here with a shared sense that there needs to be joint planning, more effort, done."</p>
<p>Manitoba Premier Gary Doer also identified the coming flu season as a major concern, comparing it to having an "H1N1 truck coming around the corner with serious implications for the health of many Canadians."</p>
<p>Some patients with serious cases of H1N1 needed to be on a ventilator for up to three weeks, much longer than the traditional flu, Doer said on the way into the meeting.</p>
<p>"The pressure that puts on all of our health-care systems cannot be diminished, and this will be the first time premiers will have had an opportunity to discuss how we are coping moving into the fall 2009."</p>
<p>Due to the importance of the topic, H1N1 has been moved onto the premiers' agenda for today as they meet at Government House, said Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall.</p>
<p>Wall said a special working group has also been struck to discuss all of the issues raised with aboriginal leaders in Regina, including education and the economy, in advance of a meeting in 2010 that will hopefully include the prime minister.</p>
<p>"The working group will begin immediately. We're going to ask them to default in favour of actions and not meetings because I think everyone has agreed we've met a lot, and it's time now to continue to provide action and leadership," Wall said.</p>
<p>The meeting of premiers, known as the Council of the Federation, comes at a time of continued economic uncertainty. Premiers are expected to discuss Employment Insurance, as the federal Conservative government and Opposition politicians consider an overhaul of the program.</p>
<p>As he arrived for the meeting with aboriginal leaders, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty told reporters he believes there is a consensus that the EI program "first developed in the wake of the Great Depression is no longer relevant in many ways to our modern economy."</p>
<p>But while western premiers have called for a move to three standards for hours worked for rural, urban and remote regions instead of the current 58 EI regions in the country, McGuinty wants a move to a single standard, at least until it is independently verified that the recession is over.</p>
<p>"If we had a three-tiered system with the lowest number of hours worked in remote regions, I don't know if the people of Windsor would qualify and they have a very high unemployment rate there right now," he said of the Ontario city hit hard by the turmoil in the auto industry. He said the current minimum of 420 hours would be a good starting point.</p>
<p>British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell said Canadians are undergoing "a big shift . . . to recognize that the era of a sort of fractured federalism is past. The world will pass us by if we can't find ways to work together as one country."</p>
<p>The western premiers have not yet settled on hour thresholds for their proposed EI tier but are currently working on a draft report that will be submitted to the federal working group by fall, he said.</p>

</div><div>Kimberly Shearon </div>
<div>The Province</div>

</p>
<p>Swine flu has claimed its third victim in B.C.</p>
<p>The province's latest victim -- a 19-year-old man -- was taken to Abbotsford Regional Hospital on July 20. He died nine days later.</p>
<p>He had an underlying health condition that made him vulnerable to the virus, said Fraser Health spokesman Roy Thorpe.</p>
<p>There have been three swine flu deaths in B.C. All three victims had underlying medical conditions that caused complications. Sixty-two deaths have been reported in Canada.</p>
<p>"The flu is circulating more than we thought it would," said Dr. Roland Guasparini, Fraser Health's chief medical officer.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus accounts for almost all recent flu cases not only in B.C., but also throughout the Southern Hemisphere, where it is now flu season, he said.</p>
<p>Provincial health officials said the public has no reason to panic.</p>
<p>B.C. is ready if an H1N1 outbreak hits this fall, said Dr. Brian Emerson, acting provincial health officer.</p>
<p>"We are fully expecting there will be a resurgence," he said. "There's lots of activity happening right now." The province has had a pandemic influenza plan in place since 2005.</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine is expected to be ready by mid-November. In the meantime, the province is prepping its vaccination program in anticipation of a busy flu season.</p>
<p>"[The vaccination] would be publicly provided," Emerson said. "There are no plans for making people pay for it." Health officials are prepared for the possibility that the vaccine's initial supply won't meet demand. Emerson said those with a higher infection risk, such as pregnant women and people with chronic health problems, will be immunized first.</p>
<p>Everyone who wants a vaccination will get one eventually, he said.</p>
<p>"What we're estimating, at the upper end, is that perhaps up to 75 per cent of the population would be interested in being vaccinated." The province is also examining how it can distribute anti-viral drugs more effectively.</p>
<p>Right now, those who exhibit flu symptoms can go to their doctor and get a prescription for an anti-viral drug such as Tamiflu. The drugs help treat flu symptoms, but do not prevent the flu itself.</p>
<p>To effectively ward off flu-related complications, anti-viral drugs need to be taken within 48 hours of contracting the virus, Emerson said.</p>
<p>He also said stockpiling anti-viral drugs near remote communities will help speed up response times.</p>
<p>Another concern is that the demand for such prescriptions could overwhelm doctor offices if a major outbreak hits B.C., he said.</p>
<p>Possible solutions include making the drugs available directly from pharmacists and providing advance prescriptions for those with chronic illnesses.</p>

<p>Nurses across Canada are calling on the Canadian premiers who are meeting in Regina this week to put health care, which is critical in any pandemic planning, on their agenda.</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan Union of Nurses (SUN) and the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions (CFNU) hosted a drop-in health clinic in Wascana Centre on Wednesday to highlight the need for Canada's health system to undergo a check-up.</p>
<p>Premiers need to agree on a common framework with targets for implementation to protect health-care workers during a pandemic, said CFNU president Linda Silas.</p>
<p>"We urge the premiers to think about the protection of health-care workers and the health human resources strategies that have to be developed by employers and unions in each of the provinces to ensure adequate health human resources during a pandemic,'' Silas said.</p>
<p>SUN president Rosalee Longmoore said Saskatchewan has made some headway in hiring more nurses, but there is a systemic problem.</p>
<p>"The major thing that we are facing today in the health-care system is the shortage of (long-term and acute-care) beds as well as a shortage of health providers,'' Longmoore said.</p>
<p>Longmoore is predicting that the first health human resource challenge Canada's health-care system will face is finding the nurses to conduct mass H1N1 immunization clinics this fall at a time when staff are already busy doing regular immunization for seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>"We know that our public health nurses are tapped heavily during influenza vaccination season and now they have another (vaccination program) on top of it,'' Longmoore said.</p>
<p>Silas suggested that the health ministers look at utilizing retired nurses, student nurses and nurses who work in offices to help with the massive H1N1 vaccination program.</p>
<p>"We need to be creative, but we need to start planning now,'' she said.</p>
<p>"We can't have a health-care system working on overtime because if we have a system that does not have a plan, we will have a crisis. How do you deal with a crisis? It's with overtime and then our members get sick and can't show up for work.''</p>
<p>The nurses' unions want a commitment from the premiers this week that their concerns will be addressed and will be requesting follow-up meetings with the provincial health ministers prior to September's Health Ministers Council meeting.</p>

</p>
<p>Not long after Canada's premiers and territorial leaders landed on our vast plain yesterday, it became obvious that they felt they had room to freely roam into places where they once chose not to go.</p>
<p>In fact, one commonality in the sweeping array of issues that leaders brought to the Council of the Federation meeting is that most of issues would once have been thought to be largely under the purview of the federal government. Consider what emerged Wednesday:</p>
<p>- Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, even before the meeting started, was promoting the need to address the U.S.'s domestic discriminatory trading practices best known as "Buy American."</p>
<p>The premiers will formally address the issue Friday -- a mere two days before Prime Minister Stephen Harper meets with U.S. President Barack Obama at Mexican President Felipe Calderon's summit Sunday and Monday in Guadalajara.</p>
<p>- Manitoba Premier Gary Doer pressed for a national strategy to address a potential H1N1 flu pandemic. ("The truck coming around the corner," Doer called it.) The Manitoba premier also outlined some very practical concerns in need of addressing, like the shortage of ventilators that would be needed for as long as three weeks by each flu victim.</p>
<p>- Quebec Premier Jean Charest promoted his province's commitment to both meeting the goals of the Kyoto Accord and to a cap-and-trade system to deal with carbon emissions. However, while so many seemed entrenched in their positions, there already appears to be dialogue among the premiers on the prospect of applying cap-and-trade revenue to meaningful technological advancements like clean coal and carbon sequestration. (As B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell said at day's end, merely calling it cap-and-trade isn't a solution in itself.)</p>
<p>- Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty noted that the nation suffers under a multi-tiered employment insurance system virtually unreformed since its inception more than six decades ago. ("I prefer we have one national standard," McGuinty said, questioning why Windsor autoworkers should be penalized.)</p>
<p>Even the initial meeting with aboriginal leaders in Saskatchewan's legislative chamber that largely focused on H1N1 and the need for a national strategy seemed to be entering a jurisdiction where premiers once thought they ought not to go.</p>
<p>Taking ownership of such issues at this meeting may represent a bit of an evolution in the great flightless bird known as the provincial premier -- a bird, undoubtedly, impressive in stature but sometimes all too eager to stick its head in the sand when it senses it might be encountering something a little dangerous.</p>
<p>Of course, many would argue that this is pretty much what the premiers have always done at their summer retreat -- or that it's exactly what premiers and territorial leaders should be doing. That would seem especially applicable to issues involving health and education that cross federal and provincial jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Moreover, it makes sense for Harper to better utilize the premiers in his battle against U.S. protectionism. (Many of them, like Wall, have developed close working relationships with U.S. senators and governors from Montana to Illinois to South Carolina.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this might all be happening out of necessity. There is a sense that provincial leaders are simply claiming territory abandoned by a federal government consumed by the political games that have accompanied successive minority governments in Ottawa.</p>
<p>That it's necessary for provincial and territorial leaders to fill the void on issues like unemployment insurance, greenhouse gas emissions and the potential of H1N1 hammering First Nations communities -- issues that should now be the priority of the federal government -- is more than a little disconcerting. It says much about what's wrong in federal politics right now.</p>
<p>But the good news is the premiers here are coming forward with their own ideas to hopefully solve these issues most pressing to Canadians, rather than simply assuming their job ends with a final-day communique imploring the federal government to do something.</p>
<p>The birds that landed in Regina on Wednesday seemed eager to stretch their wings a bit.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Face mask producers ramp up for flu season</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>672 words</div><div>6 August 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post </div>
</p>
<p>Manufacturers of respirator and surgical face masks are ramping up production and suppliers are stocking their shelves in anticipation of the fall flu season when the swine flu is expected to make a resurgence.</p>
<p>When the pandemic began in the spring, there was a rush on face masks and the supply did not meet the demand, according to some companies, who now say they are well positioned to handle more orders.</p>
<p>"We've increased production in the facilities in a number of regions to meet the demand," said Greg Snow, manager of corporate communications at <span class="companylink">3M Canada</span>, one of the country's major manufacturers of face masks.</p>
<p>Snow said there was pressure on the company in the spring to meet demand and to accurately relay to customers how long it would take for deliveries.</p>
<p>"We've enhanced our ability to communicate, given more clarity about orders, clear timelines for when they can expect delivery and provided commitments to meet them," said Snow.</p>
<p>Hospitals and governments placing large orders for face masks for example, might be waiting eight to 12 weeks at this point, said Snow, but that doesn't mean supplies will dry up.</p>
<p>"They would be getting interim deliveries until the orders were completely fulfilled," he said.</p>
<p>The federal government has 1.9 million N95 masks on order from three different companies, to add to the national emergency stockpile that already contains more than 15 million respiratory and surgical masks. The N95 is one of the most commonly used models of respiratory masks and are made to specifically fit a person's face. The government's order will be delivered in two shipments, but not until October and November, according to information provided by the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>The provinces and territories are responsible for ensuring they have adequate supplies but the national stockpile is available to them if necessary, the agency said.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Kimberly-Clark</span>, another major manufacturer of masks and other health and safety products, also said it has increased its production since the outbreak of the swine flu virus, also known as H1N1.</p>
<p>Company spokesman Lance Latham said so far, the company is meeting increased customer demand and is building inventory in preparation for the fall and winter flu seasons.</p>
<p>"Our product supply team is monitoring customer orders closely to ensure that we can continue to fill those orders," he said in an e-mail.</p>
<p>Canada's Public Health Agency does not recommend that the general public rely on wearing masks to protect themselves from contracting the virus, which has led to more than 1,200 Canadians being hospitalized and has been linked to at least 57 deaths.</p>
<p>"Evidence shows that this is not effective in preventing transmission of influenza in the general public. People often use masks incorrectly, or contaminate themselves when putting masks on and taking them off, which could actually increase the risk of infection," the agency's website states.</p>
<p>Its current guidelines say that Canadians should take normal precautions to avoid getting sick, such as washing their hands frequently, covering coughs and sneezes and staying home when sick. However, the agency does recommend that doctors, nurses and home caregivers wear masks when in contact with people with swine flu. In a health-care setting, patients suspected of having the illness are also given masks.</p>
<p>Governments and health-care facilities are some of the biggest customers for companies that make and sell masks, and their orders are often made priorities, said the president of <span class="companylink">Acklands-Grainger</span>, a large distributor of masks and other safety products.</p>
<p>"We do understand that demand will go through different cycles and phases so we want to try and make sure we stock accordingly for that," said Court Carruthers. His company has increased its supply from manufacturers and is generally able to turn orders around in 24 to 48 hours, he said, depending on the size of the order and where it is to be delivered.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Premiers sound alarm on imminent flu threat; 'We're all in this together,' Doer says</b>
</div><div>BRIAN LAGHI </div>

</p>
<p>REGINA -- Premiers and aboriginal leaders are urging swift and deep co-operation among all levels of government to deal with a flu threat that one leader says is careening toward Canada like a “truck coming around a corner.”</p>
<p>Provincial and territorial leaders gathered for their annual summer meeting yesterday seized with the need to find ways to beef up education programs, co-operate on vaccine purchases and prepare hospitals for a potential influx of patients. Manitoba Premier Gary Doer said dealing with an H1N1 pandemic could cost up to $10-billion.</p>
<p>“We have to prepare, I believe, as Canadian leaders working with Parliament, as if there is an H1N1 truck coming around the corner with serious implications for the health of many Canadians,” he said, calling the threat the most important issue facing the leaders at their talks.</p>
<p>“We're all in this together,” he added.</p>
<p>After a meeting with aboriginal leaders, Saskatchewan's Brad Wall noted that native Canadians are particularly vulnerable. Overcrowding on reserves makes it easier for the flu to spread, and remoteness and lack of simple supplies such as hand-washing liquid are causing anxiety.</p>
<p>The premiers and aboriginal leaders also demanded that all levels of government avoid jurisdictional squabbling in responding to the potential crisis.</p>
<p>Assembly of First Nations Grand Chief Shawn Atleo said Canada's natives want government assistance and money.</p>
<p>“In effect, we're asking for help to make sure the most vulnerable of our population – the indigenous peoples of this country – are well-served,” he said. “I absolutely feel that we cannot allow interjurisdictional wrangling to hold us up in doing what's right for first nations citizens of this country.”</p>
<p>Mr. Atleo said governments cannot fight over who is responsible for paying for health services while the disease races through the population. Health is a shared jurisdiction in Canada, with the federal government responsible for native reserves and disease prevention and the provinces for delivering health care.</p>
<p>Late last month, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities warned that Ottawa has not done enough to keep essential services going if pandemic influenza becomes debilitating this fall. The FCM is concerned that no plan is in place to help front-line workers such as police, public transit operators and public-health professionals.</p>
<p>While the premiers refrained from criticizing Ottawa, Mr. Doer said more work needs to be done.</p>
<p>“This is a huge challenge for Canadians,” he said. “Quite frankly, I hope I'm wrong, but I think you in the media, and we as leaders, are going to be spending a lot of time on this challenge in the fall of 2009.”</p>
<p>However, he said Canadian authorities are better prepared for H1N1 than they were for the SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>Also this week, the premiers are expected to discuss the federal government's approach to the Copenhagen climate change talks on a successor agreement to the Kyoto Accord. Quebec and Alberta want seats at the table. The provinces, however, remain distant on how far they want the government to go in reducing greenhouse gases. Alberta has expressed deep concern that too robust a regime would gut its oil sands industry.</p>
<p>Finally, the premiers will discuss responses to U.S. policies that allow American municipalities to bar foreign competition from infrastructure projects funded by government economic stimulus.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>National flu strategy needed: chiefs; First Nations leaders meet with premiers to discuss response to H1N1 pandemic</b>
</div><div>Angela Hall And James Wood </div>

</p>
<p>First Nations leaders called Wednesday for a co-ordinated national strategy to protect poor and isolated native communities from the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Speaking outside closed-door meetings of the provincial premiers and First Nations chiefs in Regina, Shawn Atleo, newly elected national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said he's looking for a "plan for action" for isolated reserves that lack the medical resources to cope with the pandemic.</p>
<p>"We need to make sure that, between jurisdictions, we have everybody working together and on the same page, to make sure that communities have the resources needed to take care of their citizens."</p>
<p>Atleo said he's confident the preparedness issues are being addressed and pledged officials will follow up on the concerns raised at the meeting Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It was made clear, even among the premiers, that they're working on surge capacity, that there's a need to make sure that rural and isolated communities are particularly supported.</p>
<p>"We leave here with a shared sense that there needs to be joint planning, more effort, done."</p>
<p>Mary Simon, president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, said the shortage of basic infrastructure in some northern communities is a major concern. "In the Arctic, because of the remoteness of our communities and the lack of services we have and the overcrowded housing, the H1N1 has the possibility of being tremendously serious for our communities," said Simon.</p>
<p>"There's a plan to immunize our people in late fall, and we'd like to know more about that."</p>
<p>The native leaders have an ally in Manitoba Premier Gary Doer, who compared the threat of the fall flu season to a "H1N1 truck coming around the corner with serious implications for the health of many Canadians.</p>
<p>"The pressure that puts on all of our health-care systems cannot be diminished, and this will be the first time premiers will have had an opportunity to discuss how we are coping, moving into the fall 2009," Doer said.</p>
<p>First Nations leaders in remote northern Manitoba communities, where H1N1 is hitting particularly hard, have said they worry the pandemic will worsen before they're armed with the same tools that helped a nearby Ontario reserve "stop flu in its tracks."</p>
<p>Two months after the first sick patients were airlifted from isolated Manitoba reserves such as St. Theresa Point and Garden Hill, the chiefs have said they are still in the dark about whether drugs such as Tamiflu will be available, should H1N1 resurface in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>There were 24 confirmed cases of H1N1 in St. Theresa Point, which is about 500 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg, and another seven confirmed cases in nearby Garden Hill.</p>
<p>Many of those infected in those communities spent as much as three weeks on ventilators.</p>
<p>The chiefs are asking why their communities received next to no antiviral drugs, when the northwestern Ontario First Nation of Sandy Lake was given 1,800 doses to control an H1N1 outbreak there.</p>
<p>A senior Manitoba Health official said its stockpile of H1N1 antiviral drugs was made available to Health Canada for distribution among the province's First Nation communities.</p>
<p>Health Canada, which is responsible for health services on First Nation reserves, is providing antivirals from provincial stockpiles to treat cases on reserve.</p>
<p>Some premiers also touched on employment insurance reform Wednesday, a topic they're expected to discuss further in meetings today and Friday.</p>
<p>Western premiers have said the system discriminates against their provinces, because laid-off workers in areas with low unemployment rates -- true of much of Western Canada in recent years -- have had to work significantly more hours to be eligible for EI, compared to workers in high unemployment areas.</p>
<p>The federal Conservative government has struck a working group to examine how to revamp the system.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Maple Leaf resumes hotdog production</b>
</div><div>Meredith Macleod  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>675 words</div><div>6 August 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A04</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>A Stoney Creek meat-processing plant is still producing hotdogs despite a countrywide recall after samples tested positive for Listeria.</p>
<p>The line in question at the Brockley Drive Maple Leaf plant had been shut down but is now back in production. Hotdogs produced on that line will be held and fully tested before being released to stores, said company spokesperson Linda Smith.</p>
<p>That hold-and-release system will be in place for the next four weeks.</p>
<p>Maple Leaf issued a recall notice for nine varieties of wieners Monday, just weeks shy of the first anniversary of a devastating listeriosis outbreak. Twenty-two people, including two in Hamilton, died after eating Maple Leaf deli meat last year.</p>
<p>The latest recall is for hotdogs produced under the Hygrade, Shopsy's and Maple Leaf brands. The company isn't saying how many packages fall under the recall.</p>
<p>Maple Leaf says the measure is precautionary only. The levels of bacteria found are very low and there have been no reported illnesses.</p>
<p>Smith said swab tests of surfaces on the line first indicated a "routine positive" for the Listeria bacteria on July 14. Twenty days later, sample tests of hotdogs by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed the presence of the bacteria.</p>
<p>Current testing methods and backlogs at federal labs mean product testing routinely takes two weeks or more. In the meantime, the products are being bought and eaten by consumers.</p>
<p>Maple Leaf and other producers are pushing the federal government to approve tests commonly used in the United States and Europe that sample products before they leave the plant.</p>
<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency did not have someone available to speak to The Spectator yesterday.</p>
<p>The Stoney Creek Maple Leaf plant, which employs 265 people, was the source of another hotdog recall in February. Maple Leaf recalled 26,000 packages of wieners that were mistakenly shipped after preliminary listeria tests proved positive.</p>
<p>Listeria is a common bacteria found in soil, plants, water, the digestive tracts of humans and other warm-blooded animals and in unprocessed foods of animal origins such as raw milk, meat, poultry and fish.</p>
<p>One strain, Listeria monocytogenes, is considered harmful to humans, especially pregnant women, the very young and old and those with compromised immune systems. Proper cooking destroys the bacteria.</p>
<p>Listeria monocytogenes is widespread and can live a very long time on surfaces, says Mansel Griffiths, a food science professor at the University of Guelph and a director of the Canadian Research Institute for Food Safety.</p>
<p>"It's very difficult to prevent this entirely from happening.</p>
<p>"There is no such thing as zero risk. Things go wrong. But when you put it in perspective, the amount of ready-to-eat meats consumed each year and the amount of people who get ill, it's a very small percentage of people. That doesn't excuse that people are getting sick."</p>
<p>Smith said the bacteria is present at low levels in 1 in 200 packages of meat found in grocery stores.</p>
<p>"It's not completely surprising to find it, but we have a zero tolerance," she said.</p>
<p>That comes out of the 2008 outbreak in which high concentrations of listeria were found in deli meat produced at a Toronto plant. "We will live with the tragedy of last August forever and ever. It will guide us," said Smith.</p>
<p>This recall could be quite damaging to Maple Leaf, says Dilip Soman, a marketing professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.</p>
<p>"People are forgiving once, but twice is once too many."</p>
<p>He says the "buffer of goodwill" from the company's candid and quick action last year may have disappeared, especially in the face of concern over other public health issues such as swine flu.</p>

<p>F irst Nations leaders called Wednesday for a co-ordinated national strategy to protect poor and isolated native communities from the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Speaking outside closed-door meetings of the provincial premiers and First Nations chiefs in Regina, Shawn Atleo, newly elected national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said he's looking for a "plan for action" for isolated reserves that lack the medical resources to cope with the pandemic.</p>
<p>"We need to make sure that between jurisdictions we have everybody working together and on the same page, to make sure that communities have the resources needed to take care of their citizens," he said.</p>
<p>Mary Simon, president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, said the lack of basic infrastructure in some northern communities is a major concern.</p>
<p>"In the Arctic . . . the H1N1 has the possibility of being tremendously serious for our communities," said Simon. "There's a plan to immunize our people in late fall and we'd like to know more about that."</p>
<p>The native leaders have an ally in Manitoba Premier Gary Doer, who compared the threat of the fall flu season to an "H1N1 truck coming around the corner with serious implications for the health of many Canadians."</p>
<p>"The pressure that puts on all of our health-care systems cannot be diminished, and this will be the first time premiers will have had an opportunity to discuss how we are coping moving into the fall 2009," Doer said.</p>
<p>Some premiers also touched on employment insurance reform Wednesday, a topic they're expected to discuss further in meetings today and Friday.</p>

<p>A third B.C. resident has died of H1N1 flu, health officials confirmed yesterday. The 19-year-old man was admitted to Abbotsford Regional Hospital July 20 and died nine days later. He had an underlying chronic condition, which made him more vulnerable to the H1N1 virus.</p>

<p>Aboriginal leaders are looking to Canada's premiers for help as First Nations' communities struggle with the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>The premiers and leaders from the Assembly of First Nations, the Native Women's Association of Canada and other groups talked about pandemic plans at a meeting Wednesday in Regina.</p>
<p>H1N1 as hit some aboriginal communities hard and leaders have pointed out poor living conditions in those communities make people more vulnerable.</p>
<p>Shawn Atleo, chief of the Assembly of First Nations, wants an action plan.</p>
<p>"In effect we're asking for help," Atleo said. "We want to make sure that the most vulnerable of our population, the indigenous peoples of this country, are well served and make sure that there are full resources."</p>
<p>Beverley Jacobs, president of the Native Women's Association, said aboriginal women can play a key role in preparedness planning because they are the caregivers in families and communities.</p>
<p>"There has been very little discussion about how aboriginal women are directly impacted by the disease, also the role that they do play in preventing the spread of infection," she said.</p>
<p>Manitoba Premier Gary Doer said the gathering is the first chance the premiers have had to discuss the issue since the outbreak started in the spring. In Manitoba, roughly two-thirds of the H1N1 cases that required hospital intensive care involved aboriginals.</p>
<p>The situation will challenge officials going into the fall, Doer said. "We have to prepare, I believe, as Canadian leaders … as if there is an H1N1 truck coming around the corner with serious implications for the health of many Canadians," he said.</p>

<p>THE outbreak of the H1N1 flu virus has prompted the <span class="companylink">Manitoba Lotteries Corporation</span> to implement special measures at its casinos and offices.</p>
<p>Additional hand sanitizers were installed throughout the casinos and educational posters were placed on the gaming floors and in the corporate offices, Lotteries spokeswoman Susan Olynik said.</p>
<p>"Those posters went up the first week of June," Olynik said.</p>
<p>Olynik said the casinos had already minimized hand contact at its slot machines with the introduction several years ago of paper receipts for winnings.</p>
<p>Casino customers are allowed to wear surgical or N95 masks on the gaming floors, she said, but must show their faces to security when entering the facility.</p>
<p>Olynik said only one customer has requested to wear such a mask since June.</p>
<p>Corporately, Lotteries' safety committee has reviewed the pandemic issue and health and safety updates are regularly provided to employees, she said.</p>

</p>
<p>A number of years ago, Details magazine had a profile of a Seattle online pornographer who amassed great wealth and little controversy.</p>
<p>The content of his many sites was lurid beyond imagination, yet, no one complained.</p>
<p>The man was pure Teflon.</p>
<p>Pure Teflon until . . .</p>
<p>For some reason, the pornographer decided to branch out. He launched a site lampooning the Pope.</p>
<p>That's when it all started to stick.</p>
<p>No amount of Teflon was going to spare him the wrath of the Catholics. The Pope site was this pornographer's ultimate undoing.</p>
<p>Last week, I crossed a group even more powerful and vitriolic than those enraged Catholics who shut down the Pope site.</p>
<p>This group is even more powerful than PETA, and I didn't think any group was more powerful than PETA.</p>
<p>Last week, I dared to challenge certain behaviours within the hardcore Vancouver cycling community.</p>
<p>PETA, I discovered, are a bunch of milksops when compared to hardcore cyclists. This surprised me, since I always associated truly devout bikers with Phish albums, daily doses of chronic and exalted love for all mankind.</p>
<p>I honestly expected my hyperbole-laced column about cyclists' sense of entitlement to go largely unnoticed. Boy, was I wrong. I have never received so many e-mails slugged: "eat flaming death, fascist media pig." I have been in this business for 30 years, so trust me, when someone drops the "eat flaming death" bomb, any hope of winning an argument has been all but vapourized.</p>
<p>As a result, I have learned my lesson. I will never again challenge the rights of cyclists to do whatever the hell they want. Cyclists are saints.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>After all, when was the last time someone flew a bike into a New York skyscraper? When was the last time anyone got AIDS from a bicycle seat? Bikes aren't melting the polar ice cap or spreading the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>My favorite correspondent over last week's column was Red Rider (not Lee Henderson's real name).</p>
<p>Lee, I mean, Red and I spent most of Friday night writing back and forth. Here is a taste of how that conversation started. Lee, I mean, Red wrote: "I have some experience writing journalism, and I can recognize an egregious ignoramus. You're hoping your readers don't have such good ear for language, that they too harbour egregious ignorance?" Red made many other points along the way.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I greatly appreciate his passion for something he clearly loves. Just wish he didn't call me an egregious ignoramus.</p>
<p>There is nothing egregious about me.</p>

</div><div>By Aldo Santin </div>

</p>
<p>A senior Manitoba Health official said its stockpile of H1N1 antiviral drugs was made available to Health Canada for distribution among the province's First Nation communities.</p>
<p>Terry Goertzen, an assistant deputy minister of health, said Ottawa did not request from Manitoba more than the 45 courses, or 450 doses, of Tamiflu it was given in mid-May to deal with an H1N1 outbreak on reserves.</p>
<p>"When it comes to health care on First Nation communities, (Ottawa) takes the lead," Goertzen said, adding no special requests for additional antiviral drugs were made to deal with the outbreak in the Island Lake communities.</p>
<p>Chiefs from Garden Hill and St. Theresa Point are demanding to know why their communities received next to no antiviral drugs when the northwestern Ontario First Nation of Sandy Lake was given 1,800 doses to control an H1N1 outbreak there.</p>
<p>Dozens of people were flown from Manitoba's Island Lake communities on medical transports to Winnipeg in May for treatment of the H1N1 virus. There were 24 confirmed cases of H1N1 in St. Theresa Point and another seven confirmed cases from Garden Hill.</p>
<p>But in Sandy Lake, antiviral medication was distributed among residents and no one was flown out for medical treatment. A day after the outbreak, 500 doses of Tamiflu were taken to the community and within three days close to 1,800 doses were available for Sandy Lake residents who displayed symptoms.</p>
<p>St. Theresa Point Chief David McDougall said only one or two residents received antiviral medication during the outbreak in May.</p>
<p>Health Canada did not respond to questions on why an adequate supply of antiviral drugs had not been provided to the Island Lake communities.</p>
<p>McDougall said health experts are predicting another H1N1 outbreak in the fall but the Island Lake communities have not been told if they will be given an adequate supply of antiviral drugs.</p>
<p>McDougall said the health council for the four Island Lake communities is drafting a plan in the event of another H1N1 outbreak, adding he expects the chiefs will see a draft at a meeting later this week.</p>
<p>Federal officials confirmed that most of the confirmed Aboriginal cases of the H1N1 virus occurred in Manitoba and health officials here stated that more than half of the confirmed cases in the province were from Aboriginal communities.</p>
<p>There have been seven deaths in Manitoba linked to the H1N1 virus and 867 confirmed cases.</p>

<p>With concerns about the H1N1 pandemic looming as flu season approaches, national aboriginal leaders and Canada's premiers will sit down in Regina today to talk about pandemic planning.</p>
<p>Beverley Jacobs, president of the Native Women's Association of Canada, said a critical component of the flu plans will be the role of women, who are often the caregivers of their families.</p>
<p>"Some places don't even have doctors or nurses, so how are they going to be address the issue? (We need) planning in those communities to minimize the threat," Jacobs said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The leaders also need to iron out any potential jurisdictional issues between the provincial and federal levels of government to ensure no one falls through the cracks, she said.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall said the H1N1 cases in the province so far haven't revealed a higher incidence of the flu in the aboriginal population versus the non-aboriginal population.</p>
<p>Jacobs said she will also be raising an issue that isn't formally on the agenda today -- violence.</p>
<p>"We feel that it's an issue that needs to be addressed by all aboriginal communities," she said.</p>
<p>Economic development, skills training and education are among the other topics the leaders are expected to discuss.</p>
<p>Metis National Council president Clement Chartier said he hopes to make progress toward finalizing a more permanent system for addressing issues facing Metis people.</p>
<p>Chartier said he hopes to work with the premiers from Ontario westward and the federal government at a meeting this fall to discuss economic opportunities, employment and training.</p>

<p>The Council of the Federation meeting that begins today in Regina actually started last January for Harley Olsen.</p>
<p>It was back then that Saskatchewan's newly appointed associate deputy minister responsible for Intergovernmental Affairs started meeting with his bureaucrat counterparts across the country in preparation for this week's meeting of provincial and territorial leaders at Government House.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Olsen explained his meetings were all about finding issues important to the other provinces and territories that might make their way on to this week's agenda. And while circumstances and issues have changed in the ensuing six months, Olsen is hoping the groundwork laid last winter will pave the way for a successful conference.</p>
<p>"At the time, we were in the middle of conversation with the federal government about developing a stimulus package," Olsen said. But even back then, the notion was to look beyond the so-called "shovel-ready" projects to ones with longer-term impact on the Canadian economy.</p>
<p>"I think Premier Wall was very much interested in not just talking about a stronger economy," Olsen said. "We were looking at the knowledge-based economy ... Our province really wanted to push the innovation agenda."</p>
<p>Of course, there are also more immediate concerns, including employment insurance, pensions affected by the downturn of the stock market (an issue especially of concern to Quebec), and a national strategy to deal with the H1N1 flu virus. "I think you'll see some high-level policy (on H1N1) emerge coming out of the conference," Olsen said.</p>
<p>Olsen has also met with the leadership of the five major aboriginal and First Nations groups in the country and heard a lot of concerns about education and skills training -- issues Olsen expects to be high on today's agenda as the premiers and territorial leaders meet with the aboriginal leadership.</p>
<p>The chair of the officials for this year's Council of the Federation is hopeful that their work will allow the provinces to find common ground, adding that steering away from division and avoiding Ottawa-bashing have been priorities for not only Saskatchewan, but also for the other delegations as well. "I don't think the public wants to see the premiers fight with the federal government right now," he said.</p>
<p>Olsen also acknowledged that no amount of pre-planning will necessarily prevent squabbling. "Ultimately, there's nobody in the room with these guys," he said.</p>
<p>But contrary to some opinions, provincial and territorial leaders take the event seriously and want to see something productive come out of it, Olsen said.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA BUREAU CHIEF</p>
<p>The Harper government is expected to face increased pressure to adopt more uniform qualifying standards for employment insurance when the premiers emerge from a meeting today in Regina.</p>
<p>A proposal from the western premiers to replace regional waiting periods with new countrywide standards is on the leaders' agenda.</p>
<p>The Conservative government has struck a panel along with the federal Liberals to revamp the system, with the Liberals wanting the regional patchwork of qualifying periods replaced with a requirement that all Canadians be able to claim benefits after working 360 hours. The Tories oppose the idea but have not ruled out streamlining standards.</p>
<p>The issue is potentially explosive. If the panel fails, the Liberals could move a no-confidence vote and force an election.</p>
<p>Several provinces, particularly Ontario, say the regional standards discriminate against their residents by making them work longer than people in other parts of the country to qualify for benefits. The system has more than 50 separate regional sets of rules.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, who will chair the meeting, said yesterday that Ottawa can expect a call for more homogeneity, but that the provinces still have a way to go before they reach a unified position.</p>
<p>“I think you're going to see calls for more uniformity by premiers and we'll see what comes out of the actual communiqué,” he said in an interview. “This is why we have these discussions.”</p>
<p>Last June, the western premiers proposed replacing the regional system with three new qualifying categories: urban, rural and remote.</p>
<p>It's not clear whether all the premiers will agree.</p>
<p>One Ontario official said that the province wants to ensure that its urban workers who lose their jobs are treated equitably.</p>
<p>“There is hope for consensus, but there are a lot of regional inequities that the federal government will have to take into account,” the source said.</p>
<p>“We will continue to search for fairness for unemployed people in Ontario.”</p>
<p>The source said that, although the western premiers like nationalized standards, other provinces may not be as warm to the idea, particularly if a new system extends the qualifying period for their workers.</p>
<p>Currently, a worker in a region of low unemployment must put in as many as 700 hours to qualify for EI, and benefits may be less generous than in other areas. Where unemployment is high, the current minimum hours worked to qualify is 420.</p>
<p>Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said a recent TD Bank report estimated that a 360-hour standard would cost $1-billion, funded either through program cuts or increased EI premiums. The TD report recommended a national standard of 560 hours, at a cost of $500-million annually.</p>
<p>The premiers are also expected to discuss emergency preparedness for a possible outbreak of H1N1 flu this winter, as well as an examination of the pension system and options for improving the incomes of retirees.</p>
<p>Mr. Wall added that the premiers also want to discuss the effectiveness of stimulus spending and what leaders should focus on when the economy improves.</p>
<p>“There are going to be many opportunities for this country coming out of recession,” he said. “I think we need a national approach and vision for the knowledge economy, for the innovation economy, for what's next.”</p>
<p>The provinces also want to go further in reducing internal trade barriers, Mr. Wall said.</p>
<p>He said doing so is important if Canada is to persuade the United States to drop policies that discriminate in favour of U.S. companies in purchasing materials for stimulus projects.</p>

</p>
<p>(From The Ottawa Citizen, August 6, 2009) Nine members of the Governor General's Foot Guards were quarantined at Carleton University as a precaution because they had displayed H1N1 swine flu symptoms; they were never diagnosed as actually having H1N1 flu. Incorrect information appeared in a headline on page B3 Wednesday.***** </p>
<p>Nine members of the Governor General's Foot Guards are in isolation at a Carleton University residence after becoming ill with H1N1 swine flu symptoms last Friday.</p>
<p>"The nine were quarantined on Saturday as a precaution because they were showing certain symptoms," Carleton spokesman Steve Blais said. "They are no longer showing the symptoms that were alarming in the first place to have them quarantined. As of (Monday) morning, none of them are continuing to show any symptoms at all."</p>
<p>Canadian Force medical personnel made the decision to place the nine in isolation, Blais said. "Even though the nine chaps are no longer showing any symptoms whatsoever, we are keeping them in quarantine for the full seven days that are recommended, just to be proactive and ensure that there is no threat to public health at all."</p>
<p>The Governor General's Foot Guards perform the colourful Changing the Guard ceremony on Parliament Hill during the summer months. Blais said "an internal note" was sent out on the weekend "to inform the Carleton community of the situation."</p>

<p>Re: "A mom's agony," Letter, Aug. 2.</p>
<p>Condolences to Brenda Nixon and her family on the loss of a loved one. Nevertheless, as a recent patient at the Rockyview, I'm grateful for the treatment I received there for a combination of the H1N1 virus and pneumonia. They discovered a blood clot in my right leg and began treatment for that as well. I have nothing but kudos for the good folks at the Rockyview; in particular, my thanks to the staff of the intensive care unit, wards 74 and 93, and the physio team.</p>

<p>L ate last November, when the skies east of Edmonton started lighting up with a meteor shower, Edmontonians turned to theTELUSWorld of Science -Edmonton (TWoSE) to find out what was going on.</p>
<p>"Our phones started ringing off the hook. People expected us to have the expertise," says George Smith, president and CEO of TWoSE.</p>
<p>And that level of expertise has not been limited to celestial goings-on. When SARS was a concern a few years ago and H1N1 started making the headlines a few months ago, TELUS World of Science -Edmonton was fielding phone calls. In response to H1N1 concerns, the centre started organizing programs and information sessions to help the public become knowledgeable about what was happening with that strain of the flu virus.</p>
<p>But it's neither realistic nor possible to expect the centre to provide the same level of expertise on all subjects and that's why the centre has begun to focus on partnerships with expert resources in the community.</p>
<p>"The pace of development is a huge challenge; the complexity is a huge challenge. Can we tackle that whole challenge on our own? Not on your life, but we can be part of meeting that challenge," says Smith.</p>
<p>As technology and science continue to grow in leaps and bounds, and as understanding becomes key in making decisions regarding legislation and regulations, Smith sees the science centre playing an even more critical role in presenting information to the general public as well as to politicians, who need to be informed when making the decisions.</p>
<p>"I think it's an information bridge that science centres and museums can help create," says Smith.</p>
<p>To that end, later this year, TELUS World of Science -Edmonton will be unveiling a dialogue facility as part of its five-year expansion plan.</p>
<p>"People want to know more in-depth about technology and science and the impacts in our lives and the issues, both moral and ethical. People want to have an opportunity to have an input. We will become the facilitator of this dialogue," says Smith.</p>

<p>Russian soccer fans planning to travel to Wales for next month's World Cup qualifier have been advised to take precautions to prevent swine flu: drink Welsh whisky.</p>
<p>"Welsh whisky is on offer to Russian supporters as a disinfectant," said Alexander Shprygin, head of the national team's fan club. "This will relieve any symptoms."</p>
<p>Britain's Health Protection Agency said that new swine flu cases reached 110,000 in the last week.</p>
<p>Russia's top doctor advised the country's citizens to avoid travelling to Britain, but Shprygin said, "Nothing will stop the Russian fans."</p>

<p>CANAM LANDS BALLPARK DEAL</p>
<p>VANCOUVER / Canam Group said Tuesday one of its units has won a contract worth almost $60 million to help build a retractable roof on the new Marlins baseball park near Miami, Fla.</p>
<p>The contract, which was won by Canam's Structal-Heavy Steel Construction unit, includes project management services, the fabrication and erection of steel components and the installation of the opening mechanism for the retractable roof.</p>
<p>DOREL RIDES INTO AUSTRALIA</p>
<p>MONTREAL / Consumer products giant <span class="companylink">Dorel Industries Inc</span>. announced Tuesday it is expanding its sports cycle business Down Under.</p>
<p>Dorel has bought the assets of Australia's Gemini Bicycles for$2.2 million US and is setting up Cycling Sports Group (CSG) Australia to bring its Schwinn, Mongoose, Cannondale, GT and Sugoi brands under one roof.</p>
<p>CSG, based in Sydney, will market to independent bike dealers. It will begin distributing Schwinn and Mongoose brands and then Cannondale bikes next January and GT next August.</p>
<p>NORTEL WINS AUCTION APPROVAL</p>
<p>WILMINGTON, DEL. / <span class="companylink">Nortel Networks Corp</span>. won bankruptcy court permission to sell its enterprise solutions business at an auction where <span class="companylink">Avaya Inc</span>. will make the opening bid of $475 million US.</p>
<p>Both U. S. bankruptcy judge Kevin Gross and Ontario Superior Court Judge Geoffrey Morawetz approved guidelines on Tuesday that will govern Nortel's Sept. 11 auction in New York. Bids must be received by noon on Sept. 4. All objections to the sale were resolved before Tuesday's hearing.</p>
<p>Nortel's enterprise solutions unit, whose customers for network gear include retailers and health-care providers, has operations in North America, Europe and Africa. The deal would double <span class="companylink">Avaya</span>'s share of the corporate phone-gear market, pushing it past <span class="companylink">Cisco Systems Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Gartner Inc</span>. analyst Jay Lassman said in a July 20 interview.</p>
<p>ACCORD SIGNED FOR FORSYS DEAL</p>
<p>LONDON / George Forrest International Afrique SPRL, an operator of mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, signed a final accord to buy <span class="companylink">Forsys Metals Corp</span>. and said it will obtain the necessary funds in two weeks. "Funds will be unconditionally available," the Wavre, Belgium-based company said in an e-mailed statement Tuesday.</p>
<p>Oakville, Ont.-based Forsys agreed on Nov. 14 to be bought by George Forrest for $7 a share, or a total cash payment of about $579 million.</p>
<p>U. S. INCOMES FALL 1.3 PER CENT</p>
<p>WASHINGTON / U. S. personal incomes tumbled 1.3 per cent in June, more than forecast and the biggest drop in four years, signalling that consumer spending will take time to recover.</p>
<p>The decline partly reflected the unwinding of one-time transfer payments from the Obama administration's stimulus plan, which boosted incomes 1.3 per cent in May, Commerce Department figures showed.</p>
<p>GAS PRICES PUSH UP SPENDING</p>
<p>WASHINGTON / U. S. consumer spending rose slightly more than expected in June, a government report showed on Tuesday, likely pushed up by higher gasoline prices.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said spending rose 0.4 per cent, boosted by expenditures on nondurable goods, after a revised 0.1 per cent increase in May, which was previously reported as a 0.3-per-cent rise. That compared to market expectations for a 0.3-percent increase in spending, which accounts for over two-thirds of U. S. economic activity.</p>
<p>U. S. CHAIN STORE SALES FALL</p>
<p>NEW YORK / Redbook Research on Tuesday released seasonally adjusted weekly data on U. S. chain store sales that showed sales down 5.4 per cent week-over-week.</p>
<p>On a month-over-month basis, retail sales were down 5.6 per cent, while they had fallen 1.6 per cent from June 2008.</p>
<p>The Johnson Redbook Retail Sales Index is a sales-weighted index of year-over-year same-store sales growth in a sample of large U. S. general merchandise retailers representing about 9,000 stores.</p>
<p>RATINGS RAISE DISCOVERY PROFIT</p>
<p>NEW YORK / <span class="companylink">Discovery Communications Inc</span>. posted a stronger second-quarter profit on Tuesday, surpassing expectations and bucking broader media industry trends, thanks to higher ratings at its U. S. cable networks and the addition of more international TV subscribers.</p>
<p>While other networks have been undercut by the downturn in advertising spending, Discovery, which is typically less reliant on some of the hardest-hit U. S. ad categories, auto and finance among them, saw its revenue dip only slightly, and profit actually rose significantly.</p>
<p>The parent of the Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and the Science Channel said second-quarter profit rose to $183 million US, or 43 cents a share, from$43 million US, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>MILWAUKEE PAPER TO CUT JOBS</p>
<p>NEW YORK / <span class="companylink">Journal Communications Inc</span>.'s Milwaukee <span class="companylink">Journal Sentinel</span> daily newspaper will cut 92 jobs, or 6.2 per cent of its workforce, as part of cost reductions that will save the publisher $21 million US annually as ad sales slip.</p>
<p>The job cuts will cost $4 million to $5.5 million US in the second half, the Milwaukee-based publisher said Tuesday. They include 37 voluntary buyout offers accepted in the <span class="companylink">Journal Sentinel</span>'s newsroom, and reductions in the printing-services. The <span class="companylink">Journal Sentinel</span>'s second-quarter revenue plunged 23 per cent to $39.9 million US.</p>
<p>APPLE SHARE TARGET RAISED</p>
<p>NEW YORK / <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>. will be able to maintain "disproportionately" high profit margins on the iPhone, said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Sanford C. Bernstein& Co</span>., who raised his price target on the shares 12 per cent to $185 US.</p>
<p>The iPhone should have faster growth than the handset market overall without Apple having to materially lower prices, Sacconaghi said Tuesday in a note to clients. In the first half, the iPhone accounted for eight per cent of revenue in the global handset market, yet 32 per cent of profit, he said.</p>
<p>Last month, Apple posted a 12-per-cent gain in sales and a 15-per-cent increase in third-quarter profit. iPhone sales increased sevenfold to 5.2 million units.</p>
<p>GE TO PAY FRAUD PENALTY</p>
<p>BOSTON / <span class="companylink">General Electric Co</span>. will pay a $50-million US civil penalty to settle charges that it had misled investors with some fraudulent accounting in 2002 and 2003, the largest U. S. conglomerate said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The SEC had found that GE's policies for accounting for hedging commercial paper and transactions at its rail unit were intentional violations of anti-fraud provisions of securities law.</p>
<p>GE said it agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying wrongdoing.</p>
<p>MORE TIME FOR OPEL SALE</p>
<p>FRANKFURT / General Motors is taking more time to negotiate with Magna and <span class="companylink">RHJ International</span> over the planned sale of its European arm Opel, the U. S.-based company said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Canadian auto parts group Magna and Belgium-based RHJ are locked in a takeover battle for Opel, in which GM is relinquishing control in return for state support.</p>
<p>GM was expected to recommend one of the two bidders to its new board of directors at a meeting on Monday. But it said on Tuesday it merely brought the board up to speed on talks without making a recommendation as negotiations were still dragging on.</p>
<p>German government officials and GM representatives are expected to meet with Magna and RHJ this week to further discuss the sale, sources said earlier this week.</p>
<p>FLU VACCINE BOOSTS GLAXO</p>
<p>LONDON / <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> has won orders for H1N1 swine flu vaccine from a further nine governments, taking the total number of doses ordered to 291 million, the British-based drugmaker said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>With more orders still to come, it could be in line for a flu vaccine windfall of more than $3 billion US in the next six months or so, according to industry analysts.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>FOUR OF THE TOP 'CLUNKERS' PURCHASE MODELS ARE FOREIGN</p>
<p>BLOOMBERG / Four of the top five models sold so far under the U. S. "cash for clunkers" program, aimed at boosting the auto industry, are made by foreign automakers, the U. S. Transportation Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Ford Motor Co</span>.'s Focus was the top seller so far, followed by <span class="companylink">Toyota Motor Corp</span>.'s Corolla, <span class="companylink">Honda Motor Co</span>.'s Civic and Toyota's Prius and Camry.</p>
<p>Initial legislation barred discounts for new vehicles manufactured overseas and offered higher payments for those produced in the U. S. than for those made in Canada and Mexico. The "Buy American" provision was dropped due to opposition from foreign automakers and free-trade advocates who said it would conflict with U. S. obligations to the World Trade Organization.</p>
<p>Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Tuesday he is "confident" the U. S. Senate will approve a measure this week adding $2 billion to the clunkers program to keep it going through this month.</p>
<p>A burst of demand exhausted most of the program's initial $1 billion in less than a week.</p>
<p>Vehicles made by the three largest U. S. automakers--<span class="companylink">General Motors Co</span>., Ford and Chrysler Group LLC--accounted for 47 per cent of sales under the program through Aug. 1, according to Transportation Department data.</p>
<p>Vehicles to be scrapped under the cash for clunkers averaged 15.8 miles per gallon, compared with 25.4 miles per gallon for the new vehicles purchased, according to Transportation Department data.</p>
<p>The Car Allowance Rebate System provides credits of as much as$4,500 for the purchase of a new car when turning in an older vehicle to be junked.</p>
<p>The Transportation Department has received about 157,000 dealer applications totalling $664 million, as the agency works through a backlog that reached hundreds of thousands of online submissions, La-Hood told reporters Tuesday.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Should Canada share its swine flu drugs? Antiviral-rich nation pushed by ethicists to help poor countries</b>
</div><div>Joanna Smith   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>505 words</div><div>5 August 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- As Canada expects to have enough antiviral drugs for everyone who needs them during a swine flu pandemic, ethicists are asking whether we should consider giving some away to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The Canadian pandemic plan includes a national stockpile of antiviral drugs that provincial and territorial governments plan to increase to 55 million doses to handle the increased demand for the medication due to the outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>"We're actually in good shape on antivirals thanks to the foresight of the public health agency," said Dr. Peter Singer, a bioethicist and director of the McLaughlin-Rotman Centre at the University of Toronto. "That is a good time to reflect on just how lucky we are in relationship to other countries around the world, particularly on the antiviral issue, and maybe a time to begin to reflect on what we can do to help."</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada has not yet decided whether to donate any part of its antiviral stockpile to developing countries that are not as well prepared, and said it is waiting for the World Health Organization to officially ask for help.</p>
<p>"We have not received a request from the WHO to donate antivirals and vaccines to developing countries," Nadia Mostafa, a spokesperson at the federal public health agency said in an email yesterday. "Canada is committed to collaborating with the (WHO) to assess the need for medical and financial support in lower income countries, and also to assess Canada's capacity to respond to those needs."</p>
<p>Dr. Ross Upshur, director of the Joint Centre for Bioethics at the University of Toronto, said wealthier countries have an ethical duty to help poorer nations out with health crises like the swine flu pandemic.</p>
<p>"There is an obligation for the better-off nations of the world to help support the low- and middle-income countries address and respond to novel pandemics, and that wouldn't be just for H1N1, but I think for every form of serious infectious disease that threatens global health security," Upshur said.</p>
<p>He said that obligation is becoming more significant now that the pandemic is beginning to pick up speed in Africa.</p>
<p>Manufacturers of the two main antiviral drugs used to treat the H1N1 strain of influenza making its away around the world have moved to make their products more accessible to developing nations.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical company Roche set up a program to produce and store pandemic stockpiles of its antiviral medication Tamiflu to sell to developing countries at cheaper prices, although a spokesperson at Roche Canada yesterday could not yet say how many nations have benefitted.</p>
<p>GlaxoSmithKline Inc. has allocated 10 per cent of its new production capacity of its antiviral drug Relenza to developing countries, and has committed to allocating 20 per cent of the vaccine produced in Ste. Foy, Que., to developing nations.</p>

<p>What was gained by this strike? Where was the noble cause?</p>
<p>I'm a union employee and am truly grateful to have a strong advocate in my corner, but how many of the issues we fight for in collective bargaining these days are worth bringing so many people's lives to a halt for so long? As desirable as some of these perks might be, must we always automatically express our displeasure with strike action? It hardly seems a fair or proportionate reaction to the grievances, especially since the brunt is mostly directed at and felt by the innocent bystander - the general public.</p>
<p>We're not talking about issues that rock the world here. This isn't the Colorado Coal Strike or the Gdansk shipyards. Can we not negotiate for however long it takes without striking? Can we not target the employer and not the people we are supposed to serve? Is H1N1 (as one example) not worthier of your more pressing attention?</p>
<p>A city sits polluted, its people gamely recovering from five weeks of neglect. Students who would have had good summer jobs now look forward to a two-week employment period, maybe three. Kids who had no camps or cottages to go to can wait till this coming weekend to enjoy the public pools, which will close on Labour Day.</p>
<p>O Labour Day, where is thy victory? O mayor, where is thy sting? Surely we all want to come off better next time.</p>

<p>Remote First Nations are worried a resurgence of swine flu will hit before they're armed with the arsenal of drugs that helped an Ontario reserve "stop flu in its tracks."</p>
<p>Two months after the first patients were airlifted from isolated Manitoba reserves such as St. Theresa Point and Garden Hill, chiefs say they are still in the dark about whether drugs such as Tamiflu will be available should H1N1 resurface in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>There were 24 confirmed cases of H1N1 in St. Theresa Point, and another seven cases in nearby Garden Hill.</p>
<p>In an e-mailed statement, Health Canada spokeswoman Christelle Legault said "adequate supplies of the antiviral Tamiflu have been shipped to affected communities, and Health Canada continues ... to help ensure that requirements for antivirals are met in a timely fashion."</p>

</p>
<p>If Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall has his way, this week's Council of the Federation conference will talk a lot about the economy -- not just today's recovering economy but also tomorrow's knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p>However, other pressing issues such as Employment Insurance, pension concerns, the H1N1 flu and Metis and First Nations concerns will also be high on the agenda as Canada's premiers and territorial leaders gather at Regina's Government House beginning Wednesday.</p>
<p>And environmentalists from the Sierra Club to Greenpeace to the David Suzuki Foundation will also be converging on the Queen City this week for what they are dubbing the Showdown in Regina, which will include a Climate Justice Rally at the Saskatchewan legislature Thursday as part of a concerted effort to convince Canadians that Alberta oilsands companies should not be exempt from greenhouse gas emission regulations.</p>
<p>"This is the time to have this conversation," Matt Price, program manager with Environmental Defence, said last week in interview from Toronto.</p>
<p>To hammer home the point, Price's non-profit environmental watchdog group released an Angus Reid poll today showing that a majority of Canadians don't want oilsands companies to have greenhouse gas emission standards that are different than those applied to other companies.</p>
<p>Urging the premiers and the federal government to "come to an agreement about how to write the rules for global warming pollution cuts," Price said the survey showed 60 per cent of Canadians wanted pollution cuts to be the same for oilsands companies while 24 per cent supported different rules for oil sands companies. Sixteen per cent didn't know.</p>
<p>Even Albertans were evenly split on the issue, Price said, while 72 per cent of Quebecers wanted oilsands companies treated the same way as other companies.</p>
<p>The Angus Reid poll of 1,012 Canadians sampled July 27-28 also showed that 46 per cent believe the provinces should attend international climate negotiations while 41 per cent believed the federal government should attend alone. The poll is accurate within plus or minus 3.1 per cent 19 times out of 20.</p>
<p>But while Price and other environmentalists want to see the premiers and territorial leaders focused on the greenhouse gas emission issue, Wall said in an interview that the premiers will also be looking for common ground on infrastructure spending as a means of pulling the provinces out of recession.</p>
<p>Wall said he would also like to see discussions on clean coal technology and sources of renewable energy as part of a future innovation agenda.</p>
<p>"Let's talk about the economy today, but 'what's next?' " Wall said. "What's the plan for the country, the vision for country going forward?"</p>

<p>Imagine your child is sick, but the Arctic community where you live has no hospital, no permanent doctor, and you must fly to the nearest hospital because there are no roads.</p>
<p>Now imagine everyone in the community getting sick. That's the doomsday scenario worrying pandemic planners.</p>
<p>Local health authorities scrambling to establish priorities warn that indigenous people are particularly at risk for contracting swine flu, because they often live in remote, impoverished communities with limited access to medical infrastructure. Crowded housing, high rates of pregnancy, young populations and chronic health problems promote the spread of infectious diseases. Some fear that next wave of the H1N1 virus, expected to be much more virulent, could be devastating.</p>
<p>Few communities have hospitals, and some communities don't even have a nursing station or a nurse, said public health nurse Gail Turner, director of health services for Nunatsiavut, Labrador, and chairwoman of the national Inuit committee on health for Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the national Inuit organization.</p>
<p>About 45,000 Inuit live in 53 communities in four regions spread over a huge area that comprises more than one-third of Canada's land mass: Nunatsiavut, Nunavik (northern Quebec), Nunavut, and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region in the Northwest Territories.</p>
<p>"We're working very hard, but this speaks to a bigger issue: access to health care," Turner said. "Where else in Canada does a patient have to fly out for a chest X-ray?"</p>
<p>The threat H1N1 poses "is like a mirror," Turner said, "showing us the gaps in the health-care system."</p>
<p>Critical-care doctors to the south are begging federal public health officials for specialized ventilators for their intensive-care units to deal with the really sick, but remote communities wonder whether they'll get equipment and the anesthesiologists to run them.</p>
<p>Public Health Agency of Canada said it bought 370 ventilators as part of the national emergency stockpile system, but it's not clear who will get them. Health-care delivery in Canada is a provincial and territorial jurisdiction -- another issue complicating pandemic planning.</p>
<p>"We're facing a sheer lack of human resources," said Turner. "Who is going to run these ventilators?"</p>
<p>The pandemic task force headed by public agencies for northern and isolated communities should have been struck earlier, Turner said. "We're now taking all the guidelines and applying the lens of remote communities. Does this fit? If not, how do we make it work for us?"</p>
<p>But Turner also noted that cases in the first wave of H1N1 were well-managed by "people working really hard in the communities. The Inuit are so resilient and have a natural capacity for sharing, and that's the crux of our survival. We just do what needs to be done."</p>

<p>Enough with swine flu panic. It's essentially a false alarm. Despite the dire warnings pumped out by medical scientists and the World Health Organization, it's likely that the second wave coming this fall will be as harmless as the first one. “This pandemic is a dud,” says Dr. Richard Schabas, the former chief medical officer of health for Ontario. About 60 Canadians have died from the disease – not quite the 10,000 or more that some alarmists had predicted.</p>
<p>If you've really got to worry about catching something, worry about the germs you catch in the hospital. They are far more deadly. Superbugs and similar infections contracted in the hospital kill about 8,000 Canadians a year, far more than all our recent so-called pandemics put together. They are our real public-health challenge.</p>
<p>“The risk of dying from swine flu is extremely small,” says Dr. Michael Gardam, a top infectious disease specialist. “But the mortality rate with C. diff is 15 to 20 per cent.”</p>
<p>Clostridium difficile is a superbug that makes you extremely sick. It's a miserable way to die. It lasts for weeks and features prolonged diarrhea. “People say it feels like they've swallowed shards of glass,” says Dr. Gardam. One woman caught it after she went into the hospital for routine knee surgery, then came down with pneumonia. She was treated with a type of antibiotic that made her highly vulnerable to C. diff.</p>
<p>An epidemic of it broke out in Quebec a few years ago. About 2,000 people died before it was brought under control. Hundreds more have died in Ontario, which is still seeing 300 new cases every month. C. diff is easily spread from feces to hand to mouth, and is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals. The infections result from our massive overuse of certain antibiotics, which can alter the normal intestinal flora and make your gut a happy hunting ground for deadly microbes.</p>
<p>Hospitals are germ factories. If you're already sick, they are a dangerous place to be. These superbugs are especially tenacious. Their spores stick around for months, on hand rails and toilet seats, and once introduced, they quickly spread around a whole building. Ordinary cleaners won't kill them. You need super-duper caustic cleaners to kill them, along with rigorous cleaning protocols. But hospitals are under extraordinary cost pressures, and cleaning staff are often cut back. Too often, infection control is given about as much attention as “a lump of sod on the front lawn,” Dr. Gardam gripes. Even hospital design is a problem. Many were built with four-bedded rooms and shared toilets – “nicely designed to spread infection,” he says. The answer is single rooms and toilets, which are more expensive at first but vastly cheaper in the long run.</p>
<p>To curb the superbugs, doctors will have to make big changes in the way they prescribe antibiotics. But the biggest challenge of all is how to get health-care workers to wash their hands as much as they are supposed to. One recent study found that approximately 40 per cent of them don't.</p>
<p>Simple? Not at all. It's remarkably complicated, Dr. Gardam says, “because it involves human behaviour.”</p>
<p>So stop fretting about getting your vaccine for swine flu. What you should really think about is how to protect yourself or your dear old mother the next time one of you is in the hospital. Here are some tips from Dr. Gardam: Get a private room if you can. Be mindful that the system and the people in it are busy and highly stressed. Stuff can get overlooked, so have someone who can ride shotgun for you. If you're like most of us, you are no doubt far too intimidated to ask your doctor whether she's washed her hands before she pokes you. But if you aren't, go ahead and ask. And wash your own hands too. Just assume there are germs all over the place.</p>
<p>As for how you should prepare for the deadly second round of swine flu, Dr. Schabas advises this: Relax, and enjoy your summer.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Aboriginal nurses ask retirees to pitch in</b>
</div><div>CHARLIE FIDELMAN    </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>350 words</div><div>4 August 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>Worried about the impact of a multiple cases of swine flu hitting small, overcrowded and remote communities, the Aboriginal Nurses Association of Canada is actively recruiting retired members to step in where needed.</p>
<p>"We're hearing stories of one nurse coping with 15 H1N1 patients, in addition to the regular workload," said Audrey Lawrence, executive director of the non-profit, non-government association based in Ottawa.</p>
<p>"The fear is that there is going to be a real shortage of resources," she said, and who will identify new cases and care for heavy cases that can result in extended hospital and home care?</p>
<p>The communities have built-in risk factors such as underlying health conditions - tuberculosis, diabetes, respiratory illnesses - a young population, high proportion of children and pregnant women, and crowded living conditions with nowhere to go in case of an outbreak. More than 100 aboriginal communities do not have clean running water. Many don't have a nursing station let alone a nurse.</p>
<p>"So it leaves the population very vulnerable," Lawrence said. "And we don't know what we will be hit with."</p>
<p>That's why the call went out to retired nurses and the response so far had been encouraging, she said.</p>
<p>"We're not saying these retired members would be doing active nursing, but they certainly know the process and can help with documentation and observation and so that allows the nurses to work faster and feel more supported."</p>
<p>People tend to minimize the flu's killer strength, once far deadlier than war, Lawrence said, drawing parallels to the 1918 Spanish influenza.</p>
<p>Lawrence's great uncle Albert Swaffield was 14 and living in Cartwright, Labrador, when the Spanish flu epidemic swept in. "He ended up burying more than 300 people, a third of the community," she said. "Can you imagine having to do that?"</p>
<p>Back then people didn't know what was happening and they didn't have time to plan, Lawrence said.</p>
<p>"We have time to plan." For information, go to www. anac.on.ca</p>

</div><div>Teresa Smith   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>337 words</div><div>4 August 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Researchers are tracking the spread of the H1N1 flu using technologies such as cellphone satellites, GPS mobile devices and flight patterns to see where the disease came from, where it's going, and what governments and health organizations can expect so they can be ready to fight it.</p>
<p>Alessandro Vespignani, from Indiana University, has developed computer models which predict that the worldwide peak for H1N1 will be in October or early November -- much earlier than the typical flu peak around December or January.</p>
<p>His conclusions, being watched by governments and the World Health Organization, will affect policy as health officials work around the clock to prepare an H1N1 vaccine in time.</p>
<p>Vespignani's model has three layers: census data (demographic information about people, such as age and location), mobility (how people travel, both locally and internationally each day), and the nature of the disease itself (how it spreads between people, including the length of the incubation period).</p>
<p>He said the way people move within their own cities and around the world doesn't really change much from day to day, even during a pandemic. So, he made a computer model that tracks the movement of the disease by studying patterns of human movement: tracking international flights and daily commuting patterns.</p>
<p>Vespignani says the next step is to develop an infrastructure of sensors all over the world that would feed</p>
<p>real-time information -- from social media such as Twitter -- into a super-computer network that could then crunch the numbers, and, depending on the questions researchers plug in, spit out answers.</p>
<p>"We are on the edge of a scientific revolution," he said. "It will change our way of looking at society and our predictive power on it.</p>
<p>Vespignani says his model could also be used to help governments develop disaster relief plans in the aftermath of tsunamis, earthquakes and other natural catastrophes.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Kahnawake takes swine flu seriously; Hospital responds to pandemic threat with an army of hand sanitizers</b>
</div><div>CHARLIE FIDELMAN   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>479 words</div><div>4 August 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>In Kahnawake, even the church is equipped with hand gel sanitizer.</p>
<p>"We're all shaking hands and kissing at church, so I said: 'I'm putting a stop to this,' " said Dr. Suzanne Jones, the director of professional services at the Kateri Memorial Hospital Centre.</p>
<p>Next to the gel there are posters and pamphlets; a new influenza information hotline was started, and Kateri hospital screens everyone at the door. Triage is marked by a giant stop sign in English and Mohawk.</p>
<p>"We have centralized all the comings and goings through one door to monitor staff, clients and visitors," Jones said. "It's active triage - not just pamphlet and posters - we have someone asking whether you are coughing and have a fever."</p>
<p>Home to about 9,700 people, the Mohawk reserve south of Montreal sprung into preemptive swine flu action in April when the World Health Organization declared H1N1 a level five alert.</p>
<p>Kahnawake has a higher proportion of chronic illness - diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular and lung disease - than the Quebec average, making its population more at risk for the spread of swine flu infection, Jones said.</p>
<p>"But our standard of health and demographics are comparable to the surrounding community. We're not faced with a lack of access to running water and toilets," she said of isolated aboriginal communities to the north.</p>
<p>A local committee comprised of a public health nurse, an infection control nurse, ambulance, fire, peacekeepers and Band Council officials, plus education and community service personnel, started meeting twice weekly. It established procedures with the Montérégie Regional Health Board, the Anna Laberge Hospital Centre in Châteauguay and the McGill University Health Centre.</p>
<p>Anyone needing a ventilator will be sent first to Anna Laberge.</p>
<p>"We took it very seriously. We didn't know what was going on in the first two weeks. It was very worrisome," Jones said, adding that to reassure the community, Mohawk Council communications officer Gene Diabo spoke at town hall meetings and on local TV about basic flu hygiene and prevention etiquette, new hospital procedures and possible treatment. So far, no swine flu illnesses have been identified in the community, although it's possible some cases are so mild they've gone unnoticed, Jones said.</p>
<p>Still, when provincial Health Minister Yves Bolduc visited Kateri in May to sign an expansion agreement for the 43-bed hospital, he stopped at the stop sign and got the full treatment. Screening questions have changed since the early days - from asking about travel to Mexico, to travel anywhere outside Quebec.</p>
<p>Jones said that some areas of pandemic preparedness still need work - for example, non-traditional health sites to centralize services, trajectories and traffic flows so the sickest people will be seen.</p>
<p>"But we're ahead of the game."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Face masks slow spread of flu, says study; Enhanced handwashing also required</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>

<div>602 words</div><div>4 August 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Sporting a face mask and enhancing personal hygiene can help prevent the spread of the flu among people living under the same roof, suggests a new study--but timing is everything.</p>
<p>The study, to appear today in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, showed that hand hygiene and face masks seem to mitigate the household transmission of the flu when the measures are used in combination and within 36 hours of one person in the house getting sick.</p>
<p>Researchers in Hong Kong carried out the study last year, in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. Now that most countries are in the midst of the global H1N1 flu pandemic, the results are particularly relevant, they said.</p>
<p>But the results certainly don't mean everyone should rush out to buy face masks and the study is not going to change any public health guidelines, said a spokeswoman for the CDC.</p>
<p>"The science has not given us a clear answer, so this is just another piece of the puzzle, another contribution to the body of knowledge," said Artealia Gilliard, adding there is currently a lot of conflicting studies.</p>
<p>"Right now we are not recommending that people who live in a household with someone that is infected with H1N1 wear a face mask within the house," she said.</p>
<p>Hand hygiene and face masks are commonly cited as key actions to prevent the flu, but the article says few studies have been done to show whether they are truly effective in preventing transmission.</p>
<p>Participants in the study were divided into three groups: a control group, a group that practised an increased level of hand hygiene and one that combined that measure with wearing a face mask.</p>
<p>Participants were provided with liquid hand soap and told to wash after every washroom visit and when their hands were generally dirty or after sneezing or coughing. They used the hand sanitizer when first entering the home and after touching any potentially contaminated surfaces. Those given masks were told to wear them all the time, except when eating or sleeping.</p>
<p>In 154 households out of a total of 259 that participated, transmission from one family member to another was reduced when face masks and hand hygiene were both used within 36 hours.</p>
<p>The study could not distinguish precisely the benefits of the two measures individually -- only the advantages when combined.</p>
<p>Home visits were conducted by nurses every three days and some infections may have been missed if the peak of the illness happened in between visits.</p>
<p>Gilliard said another important caveat of the study was that for the face masks to be considered effective, they had to be worn properly and at all times.</p>
<p>"The other finding in the study was that most of the time, that doesn't happen," she said.</p>
<p>Throughout the current swine flu pandemic, Canadian public health officials have been hammering the importance of proper hand washing as a protective measure.</p>
<p>Like the CDC, the Public Health Agency of Canada doesn't recommend the general public wear masks. It says evidence shows they are not effective in preventing transmission in community settings and people often use them incorrectly--and can end up contaminating themselves when putting them on or removing them.</p>
<p>The exception to that advice, though, is when a person is directly caring for someone in their home who has the virus.</p>
<p>Similarly, doctors or other health-care workers may wear masks to reduce the risk of infection.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Put your mouth where your money is</b>
</div><div>645 words</div><div>4 August 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>Fed up with federal foot-dragging in the midst of the worst economic crisis ever in the pork sector, farmers - and those who support farmers - are sending out their own pleas for help.</p>
<p>Stewart Skinner, a sixth generation farmer from Listowel and a University of Guelph graduate student, has taken it upon himself to issue a news release asking that taxpayers bail out his industry - but not with handouts. Instead, Skinner wants you to put your mouth where your money is, and eat local pork.</p>
<p>In his news release, Skinner says purchasing food grown in Ontario is an excellent way for consumers to make a difference for their rural neighbours and the environment.</p>
<p>"Buying locally grown products is by far the best way to help your local farmers," says Skinner. "When you eat something that is grown in Ontario, you not only help farmers, you help support Ontario's agricultural industry and 700,000 Ontario jobs."</p>
<p>Southeast of the Skinner farm, veterinarian Martin Misener of Linwood Veterinary Services has a similar message - put pork on your fork and help farmers.</p>
<p>With his own cash, he secured Dog & Pony Productions of St. Thomas to help put together a 30-second video he's hoping commercial television stations will pick up and use as a service announcement.</p>
<p>In the well-paced video, Misener talks about how the Canadian pork industry is in peril this summer, with families in jeopardy of losing their farms. The sector works hard to provide a safe, wholesome and economical product, he says, and you can help by buying Ontario pork.</p>
<p>In an announcement to promote the video's release, Misener recalls the pork industry was just starting to recover from a tough couple of years when along came the H1N1 virus. The "swine flu" naming controversy sent the industry reeling further.</p>
<p>It's a particularly poignant situation for Misener - he says he lived through his own family's farm bankruptcy in the 1970s. And, he says, the current crisis is worse than that.</p>
<p>Misener and Skinner join thousands of other Ontario and Canadian farmers - and their counterparts in the United States - who hope buy-local messages are sinking in with consumers. Certainly the Ontario government has done its share to support buy-local campaigns, and "Taste Of…" campaigns seem to be visible and successful.</p>
<p>But as a movement, the local food initiative is still in its infancy. It's gaining momentum with special events, such as the superb packed-to the-rafters 100-kilometre dinner last week at the Borealis restaurant in Guelph.</p>
<p>However, there's still a lot of room to grow, and Misener and Skinner hope their efforts move it along. For his part, Skinner's hoping to see Ontario products more clearly identified in the grocery store so consumers aren't left guessing about a food's origin. In some cases now, you have to squint hard at the label to find where your dinner originated.</p>
<p>And finally, says Skinner, don't forget about the true cost of importing food and the impact it can have on the environment.</p>
<p>"People don't realize that when they buy imported pork, countless litres of diesel fuel have been burned as it travelled more than 1,000 kilometres from the United States," he says, whereas the Ontario industry is dominated by small family farms such as his.</p>
<p>"Buying local," he says, "can really help the sector in these tough times."</p>
<p>Ottawa has said it's talking with the Canadian Pork Council about a way out of the crisis. I don't know what the delay's about; this situation didn't sneak up on the government and there's been numerous pleas for help. Hopefully a local food push will help farmers hang on a bit longer and even start turning things around.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Fowler ready for anything Down Under; Former Liverpool star hoping to fire up Fury in Australian league</b>
</div><div>Star wire services</div>
<div>717 words</div><div>4 August 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>S02</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Ex-Liverpool star Robbie Fowler is ready to help his North Queensland Fury and the A-League by doing what he does best: scoring goals and staying in the limelight.</p>
<p>Rejecting suggestions he had come to Australia for a "getaway" to escape the spotlight in Britain, the former England international said at the A-League's official launch yesterday that he wanted to put in the type of performances that will make him the centre of attention.</p>
<p>"If you play football and if you're successful you're going to get headlines and people talking about you," Fowler said.</p>
<p>"I'm hoping for a lot more press because I want to be successful and I want to score a lot of goals. If I'm getting more attention it means I'm doing a good job."</p>
<p>Fowler became the A-League's biggest recruit by joining the Fury after an England career which included stints with Liverpool, Manchester City and Blackburn.</p>
<p>The fourth-highest all-time scorer in the English Premier League, Fowler admitted he wasn't sure exactly what to expect when his A-League career kicks off in the Fury's season opener against Sydney FC on Saturday in the northern city of Townsville.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old Fowler said his pre-season hadn't been ideal, making only three appearances for the Fury after battling a groin injury.</p>
<p>"I've not played as many games as what I would have liked to in the pre-season, which is not great for me," Fowler said. "But I feel great at the minute and when the season starts I'll be feeling as good as I have for a long time."</p>
<p>CLUTCH 'KEEPING: Goalkeeper Frank Rost saved two penalties to help Hamburger SV overcome second division Fortuna Duesseldorf 4-1 in a penalty shootout in the first round of the German Cup yesterday.</p>
<p>Fortuna, newly promoted from the third division, scored in the final second of extra time on a deflected shot by captain Andreas Lambertz to make it 3-3 and send the match to penalties. But Rost's prowess at saving penalties ultimately proved decisive.</p>
<p>COACH FIRED: Newly promoted Bundesliga side Mainz fired coach Joern Andersen after an embarrassing loss in the German Cup.</p>
<p>Mainz, which returned to the Bundesliga after two seasons in the second division, lost 2-1 at fourth-division Luebeck in the first round of the German Cup on Friday.</p>
<p>Christian Heidel, a Mainz director, said the 46-year-old Norwegian coach was fired because communication between the players and Andersen had broken down.</p>
<p>Thomas Tuchel, the 35-year-old coach of Mainz's junior team, was named as Andersen's successor.</p>
<p>UNIQUE FLU VACCINATION: The head of the Russia national team's fan club has urged supporters travelling to Wales for next month's World Cup soccer qualifier to drink Welsh whisky to repel the swine flu virus.</p>
<p>"Welsh whisky is on offer to Russian supporters as a disinfectant," Alexander Shprygin said yesterday. "This will relieve any symptoms."</p>
<p>Russia's top doctor advised the country's citizens to avoid travelling to Britain, but "nothing will stop the Russian fans," Shprygin said.</p>
<p>Britain's Health Protection Agency has said the number of new swine flu cases reached 110,000 in the last week of July. Russia has 55 confirmed swine flu cases.</p>
<p>RIBERY GETS CALL: France coach Raymond Domenech called up Franck Ribery yesterday for an upcoming 2010 World Cup qualifier away to the Faeroe Islands, even though the Bayern Munich player ruled himself out of the match last week.</p>
<p>Ribery missed Bayern's pre-season games because he has had tendinitis in his left knee since July 12.</p>
<p>On Friday, Ribery said that he was not due to resume training with Bayern until mid-week, and would not be able to play against the Faeroe Islands.</p>
<p>But Domenech named him in his 22-man squad. Domenech believes the 26-year-old Ribery can make a substitute appearance if needed.</p>

</p>
<p>The premiers gather tomorrow in Regina for their annual conference. With federal politics devoted mostly to name-calling and finger-pointing these days, the premiers' conference can perform an important agenda-setting function for the whole nation by refocusing debate on neglected issues of public policy.</p>
<p>With the notable exception of poverty - which, sadly, is not up for discussion in Regina - most of the key issues facing the nation are on the table for the premiers' three-day meeting. These include the economy and steps toward recovery, pensions and other social programs, Canada-U.S. trade and responses to "Buy America" legislation, internal trade barriers, climate change, employment insurance (EI) and the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>As well, in a pre-meeting tomorrow afternoon, the premiers will sit down with aboriginal leaders to discuss education issues.</p>
<p>Gone are the days when the premiers viewed their annual meeting either as primarily a social event or an opportunity to bash Ottawa and demand more federal funding of provincial programs.</p>
<p>Of course, there are sharp differences among the premiers on many of the issues on their agenda - notably climate change, where the "petro-provinces" (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland) are at odds with the others. They will either paper over these differences with meaningless phrases or just agree to disagree.</p>
<p>But the very fact the issues are even being raised makes for a refreshing break from the political spin that preoccupies Ottawa. Plus there is a possibility for the premiers to make progress on some fronts.</p>
<p>Pensions, for example. British Columbia and Alberta are talking about setting up their own provincial plans to compensate for the gradual decline of viable pensions in the private sector. For his part, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty will press for a national debate on the issue, including possibly a first ministers' conference. That makes sense. We don't need a patchwork of 10 different provincial pension plans. An enhanced Canada Pension Plan would be better.</p>
<p>With unemployment continuing to rise, the premiers might also step up pressure on Prime Minister Stephen Harper to reform EI, which now covers less than half of all jobless workers.</p>
<p>On aboriginal education, the premiers could resurrect the joint federal-provincial approach abandoned by the Harper government with the scrapping of the Kelowna Accord.</p>
<p>The premiers represent 10 varied provinces (as well as three territories) and several different political parties. But they share a common set of problems and, for the most part, a pragmatic approach to solutions. What they say this week in Regina should make the parties in Ottawa - both government and opposition - sit up and take notice.</p>

<p>BURRESS INDICTED</p>
<p>Former New York Giants wide receiver Plaxico Burress was indicted Monday on two felony counts accusing him of criminal possession of a weapon and one misdemeanour count of reckless endangerment, prosecutors said. Burress, 31, who caught the winning touchdown in the Giants' Super Bowl victory in 2008, was released by the team after a November 2008 incident in which he accidentally shot himself in the leg at a New York nightclub.</p>
<p>LYNCH SUSPENSION</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills running back Marshawn Lynch's three-game suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy will stand. The league announced that Lynch's appeal was denied in a statement released Monday afternoon. Lynch pleaded guilty in March to a misdemeanor gun charge in Los Angeles. He was sentenced to 80 hours of community service and three years probation.</p>
<p>NADAL LOOKS TO MONTREAL</p>
<p>World No. 2 Rafael Nadal will return to action at next week's Montreal Masters event after a two-month layoff with injury, his coach and uncle Toni Nadal said Monday. The Spaniard has been suffering from tendinitis in both knees and has not played a competitive match since being knocked out in the fourth round of the French Open by Robin Soderling May 31.</p>
<p>FORREST REMEMBERED</p>
<p>Three-time boxing champion Vernon Forrest was remembered Monday by some 1,500 friends, family and fellow athletes as a soft-spoken, modest competitor defined more by his work helping others than his victories in the ring. The 38-year-old Forrest, a former two-division champion who gained notoriety when he became the first boxer to defeat Sugar Shane Mosley, was shot and killed July 25 in Atlanta.</p>
<p>LIONS BOLSTER LINEUP</p>
<p>The struggling B.C. Lions bolstered their lineup Monday, signing three players to CFL contracts, including veteran linebacker JoJuan Armour. Armour played with the Lions in 2004 and 2005. Also signed Monday were import running back A.J. Harris, who spent last season with Edmonton and Canadian defensive lineman James Edwards, who led McMaster University in sacks in 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p>FANS TOLD TO DRINK WHISKEY</p>
<p>Russian soccer fans heading to Wales for next month's World Cup qualifier are urged to take precautions to ward off swine flu: Drink Welsh whiskey "Welsh whiskey is on offer to Russian supporters as a disinfectant," Alexander Shprygin, head of the national team's fan club, said Monday. "This will relieve any symptoms." Hundreds of Russian fans are expected to travel to Cardiff for the Sept. 9 qualifier.</p>
<p>HAMBURG VICTORY</p>
<p>Goalkeeper Frank Rost saved two penalties to help Hamburger SV overcome second-division Fortuna Duesseldorf 4-1 in a penalty shootout in the first round of the German Cup Monday in Frankfurt. Fortuna scored in the final second of extra time on a deflected shot by captain Andreas Lambertz to make it 3-3 and send the match to penalties.</p>
<p>RACHEL AT HOME</p>
<p>Back in her summer home at Saratoga, superstar filly Rachel Alexandra is set to begin training for her next race -- which won't be determined for another two weeks, trainer Steve Asmussen said Monday. Less than 15 hours earlier, racing's leading lady easily beat the boys for a second time in the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park -- her eighth straight victory and 10th in 13 career starts.</p>
<p>BATH TRIO BANNED</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu reveals fatal flaw; To date, none of the budgeted money seems to have made its way to the front lines and trenches.</b>
</div><div>Jaro Kotalik   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1197 words</div><div>4 August 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>While we continue to observe a daily increase in the number of swine flu cases across the country, we take comfort in the fact that our country has been preparing for a pandemic for years. It is true that we have an elaborate, expertly produced national pandemic plan, which in turn gave rise to provincial, territorial, regional and local plans.</p>
<p>Canada has even been called a world leader in pandemic preparedness by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>But there is an inherent weakness in our pandemic planning, a weakness which greatly undermines all the effort put into this enterprise, a weakness which may in the end be fatal.</p>
<p>In 2004, a Canadian pandemic plan was released that did not say a word about the amount of material and human resources that would be required for each of the hundreds of proposed pandemic measures, nor about who would provide these resources. When you stop to think about it, it's almost unbelievable: the largest public health program ever proposed in our national history was launched without any budget or allocation of funds.</p>
<p>Those who disagree will cite that in 2006 the federal budget earmarked $1 billion over five years for this cause. Three years into this budget, we know that the federal government purchased stocks of the antiviral drug Tamiflu and contracted for the production of a vaccine. However, these actions, while important and laudable, are far from meeting all the essential requirements.</p>
<p>To date, none of the budgeted money seems to have made its way to the front lines and trenches where the real war against the pandemic will largely be fought, such as the hospitals I am associated with.</p>
<p>This economic blind eye approach has resulted in our lack of readiness to care for those sick with the flu.</p>
<p>The sudden emergence of an enormous number of sick people is the hallmark of a pandemic. The national plan for a moderate pandemic estimates that of 4.9 million who will become ill, 109,000 about two per cent, will need to be admitted to a hospital.</p>
<p>The plan does not suggest how these additional patients could be accommodated given the fact Canada has just over 100,000 beds and that they are 90 per cent full all the time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it now appears that the demand for hospital beds may be much higher than what our planning experts had predicted.</p>
<p>On June 12, the Public Health Agency of Canada reported that not two per cent, but five per cent of confirmed cases of pandemic flu had to be hospitalized. And not any kind of hospital bed will suffice.</p>
<p>Because the most frequent serious complication of any flu is pneumonia, and in some cases the inability to breathe, these flu patients will require mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit in order to survive. This fact was foreseeable, and it is well known that these beds (with ventilators) are constantly in short supply, yet no provisions were made to at least partially remedy the shortage.</p>
<p>To their credit, the Ontario pandemic planners went as far as to estimate the required number of beds with ventilators. As the situation stands, it appears that at the peak of demand, pandemic flu patients may need almost twice as many beds with ventilators as are currently being used across the province for all patients.</p>
<p>To date, no relief of the shortage has been proposed.</p>
<p>It appears that when hospitals exceed their "surge capacity," that is, have more patients than they can treat, the province will declare "mass emergency care."</p>
<p>In this case, physicians will be expected to decide who will get a ventilator and who will only receive comfort measures.</p>
<p>A recent situation in Winnipeg highlighted how ill-prepared our hospitals are. In mid-June, at the very beginning of the H1N1 flu outbreak, when the province had only 119 confirmed cases, 31 of them needed ventilators.</p>
<p>Winnipeg hospitals were forced to cancel non-urgent surgery, discharge other patients earlier and order 15 additional ventilators.</p>
<p>The fact is that the health care delivery system in Canada is stretched to its limits. As you read this article, wherever you are, at this very moment there is probably a "discharge planner" going around your local hospital trying to determine which patients could be sent home, not necessarily because it would be best for the person, but because unless someone is discharged, it is not possible to get a bed for any of the patients waiting for admission in the overcrowded emergency room.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, how can hospitals, pressed to avoid deficits, and having no dedicated funding for a pandemic even now when a pandemic is here, engage in serious preparation for increased demand?</p>
<p>So all of us are closing our eyes to the unpleasant, unmanageable reality and hoping that, somehow, we will get through this. This is of course not the stuff of press releases, and so the public is largely kept in the dark.</p>
<p>As someone who has promoted for years the idea that the hospital is a moral community, which has an ethical responsibility to our patients, our staff and also the people in the region we serve, I find it impossible to stay silent.</p>
<p>The issue is just too big to be confined to the hospital. There is a need for evidence-based political decisions.</p>
<p>I have recommended to our hospital that we should determine what resources we need to provide care at the height of the pandemic to all patients who can be reasonably expected to rely on us. We should then notify our funding agency and include an estimate of the potential human cost of not having the necessary resources.</p>
<p>If funding is not received, our hospital has an obligation to inform the public about the lack of resources, which may result in our inability to provide adequate care.</p>
<p>If we fail to do this we will have an ethical responsibility for the harm or deaths which could have been prevented.</p>
<p>I appreciate that our funding authority, considering all the needs, may not be able to provide the resources, and may be able to justify that.</p>
<p>What I suggest is not a pressure tactic, but a process which is necessary if we wish to respect the values of accountability, inclusiveness and transparency -- the values of the Ontario pandemic planning ethical framework.</p>
<p>If given a choice, would Canadians want our health care system to go through the pandemic, the largest threat to the health and life of Canadians in many decades, with no additional resources, scaling down care to what the regular budget provides?</p>
<p>Or would they be prepared to pay for the best possible care, knowing that the deaths which will occur were humanly unavoidable?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu spooks local Hajj pilgrims; New restrictions to curb the spread of disease put plans for annual trek to Mecca in doubt</b>
</div><div>Noor Javed </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>617 words</div><div>3 August 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star </div>
</p>
<p>A few minutes into an introductory session on Hajj at the Islamic Institute of Toronto yesterday, volunteer Mohamed Mobeen tells a small group of potential pilgrims about the challenges they will face when they embark on the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in November.</p>
<p>Expect crowds, exhaustion and illness, he says.</p>
<p>But this year, there is another threat that could exclude hundreds from the city from even setting foot in the holy land: swine flu.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Arab health ministers laid out restrictions for pilgrims travelling to Mecca between now and the Hajj in an effort to curb the spread of the H1N1 virus. They advise travellers over 65 years old or under 12, as well as the chronically ill, to avoid the pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Toronto Hajj tour operators say the new rules have local pilgrims worried. "We have been getting a lot of calls from elders, and from those planning on taking their parents for Hajj," said Ahmed Elkhouly, with Falcon Travel.</p>
<p>Confusion is never good for business, even one that is divinely ordained. "We haven't had any cancellations, but the swine flu is something that is hanging over the operators," said Elkhouly. "It has affected the industry in general."</p>
<p>He says the country's 25 registered Hajj operators are still awaiting official word from the Saudi Arabia-based Ministry of Hajj as to how binding the new directives are.</p>
<p>Every year, about 4,000 Canadians travel for Hajj, most of them from the GTA. Able-bodied Muslims are required to complete the pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime. Hundreds of others also travel to Mecca to perform the lesser pilgrimage or the Umrah, with greatest numbers during the month of Ramadan, which begins at the end of this month. More than 3 million Muslims are expected to visit Saudi Arabia during this time.</p>
<p>Concerns began to mount after a 25-year-old Egyptian woman died from the virus after visiting Mecca in July. Saudi Arabia advised pregnant women to avoid Mecca in June, and Tunisia has banned its citizens from performing Umrah.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada said it will be "issuing a travel health notice in coming weeks to address recommendations to travellers and requirements set by the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia for pilgrims" and the Canadian Border Services Agency will assess whether additional screening is needed when pilgrims return.</p>
<p>Mobeen said many group operators themselves are making recommendations. "We had indicated to most of our group members that we would require them to be inoculated with the Tamiflu vaccination," said Mobeen. "And we are taking the stand that if you are not healthy, or have chronic issues, you should get yourself checked out by a doctor before you commit," he said.</p>
<p>Pilgrims are required by the Hajj ministry to be vaccinated for meningitis, and have shots up to date before they are issued a Hajj visa.</p>
<p>Elkhouly said he is encouraging his clients, who may pay $7,000 for the trip, to buy travel insurance.</p>
<p>But many pilgrims remain unfazed. Qassim Hussein, who left for Umrah on the weekend, said he is taking masks and hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>"Even if there was an outbreak of swine flu, I don't think I would be concerned," said Hussein. "Mecca is one of those places you go without fear of what might happen."</p>
<p>Noman Siddiqui, who is going for Hajj this November, shares those sentiments. "I'm not worried at all, it is just a blessing to be able to go."</p>

<div>MUSIC INTERVIEW / MELISSA AUF DER MAUR</div>

<p>Montreal's Melissa Auf der Maur, we are pleased to report, is over her nasty bout with swine flu. But as for a rumoured reunion with Hole, the grungy alt-rock band fronted by Courtney Love in the 1990s – that will only happen when pigs take to air.</p>
<p>“There's no reunion coming,” says Auf der Maur, who was Hole's bassist for five years.</p>
<p>“I don't have anything against reunions, but it's something that has to be done delicately and with class, and a lot of time and intelligence has to go into it.”</p>
<p>Delicacy and class from the lady Love? She who has admitted to “gnarly” drug issues in the past, who once strip-teased professionally? “She's a unique force of nature,” says Auf der Maur, who characterizes her relationship with the widow of rock legend Kurt Cobain as a “respectful sisterhood.”</p>
<p>An announcement by Love that a new Hole album was forthcoming set off a battle of tweets with the band's co-founder Eric Erlandson as to the legitimacy of the project. Auf der Maur had been asked last year by producer Michael Beinhorn to contribute backing vocals to Love's solo album. She agreed to do it – “I like singing ooos, aaahs and la-la-las behind her voice” – but it never happened.</p>
<p>Asked about new photographs showing a troublingly emaciated Love, Auf der Maur declined to speculate on her former band mate's condition. “I'm not an official spokesman for her, so I can't say, but she has been through a lot of ups and downs throughout her public and personal life.”</p>
<p>Recently Auf der Maur went through turmoil of her own.</p>
<p>She'd been sick on and off for a month this summer when she came across a health article in this newspaper. The question then dawned on her: “Have I been kissed by the gloom of Swine?” She had indeed. Doctors eventually concurred.</p>
<p>“It was the sickest I've ever been from the flu in my adult life,” says the daughter of Canadian journalist and politician Nick Auf der Maur.</p>
<p>Readers of online news website The Mark already know about the musician-photographer's fight with the pandemic. Auf der Maur had agreed earlier in the year to contribute to the Toronto-based site as an entertainment and music columnist, but had put it off because she was feeling so subpar.</p>
<p>Her editor then suggested she keep an online diary chronicling her flu fight, which she did, articulately and with accompanying photos of herself bundled up in bed with her cats, laptop computer, books and naturopathic remedies. “Keeping the immune system strong, with vitamins, herbs and natural antibiotics” is her suggested regimen.</p>
<p>Falling ill couldn't have come at a worse time for Auf der Maur, who is hands-full busy with Out of Our Minds (OOOM), the title of her second solo rock album and a yet-to-be-released multiplatform project that incorporates an experimental short film (with an atmospheric film score she wrote and performed) and a comic book, all themed around time-travel and the mythology of the Vikings. The components now completed, she's working on how to present the material. In January, the film screened at Sundance; in June she played a showcase at Toronto's North by Northeast Festival; and this week she'll be appearing at Anticipation, the 67th World Science Fiction Convention held this year in Montreal from Aug. 6 to 10.</p>
<p>So far, the sci-fi fraternity has warmly embraced the self-described “fantasy geek,” once named to Blender magazine's list of rock music's hottest women. Auf de Maur, who is the heroine of the comic book, sees her acceptance into the community as “an honour and a privilege,” and she's stoked to hit the convention in her hometown. “I'm excited to get in front of all those people in their cloaks and their costumes and their open eyes,” she says.</p>
<p>At the convention, on Aug. 7, she'll show the film she stars in – OOOM is a 28-minute “wordless braid of multiple storylines,” directed by Tony Stone – and follow the screening with an acoustic set of music. As well, she'll participate in a forum on “constructing the fantastic in music” and, with author Neil Gaiman and others, discuss new media. “It's about how the 21st century has affected all forms of media – comics, film, music and storytelling,” she explains.</p>
<p>Her own package will come out this winter. No longer affiliated with a major recording label, Auf der Maur is her own boss – and thrilled with the developing models of music distribution. “It's all about finding ways of presenting of it,” she says. “It's not about the record-album release date any longer.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>I'll go to jail before I get that vaccine</b>
</div><div>Kevin Brooker   </div>
<div>For The Calgary Herald</div>
<div>719 words</div><div>3 August 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Last month, the U. S. National Institutes of Health put out a call for several thousand volunteers to receive the nation's first swine flu shots.</p>
<p>Starting next week, at eight medical centres, self-selected guinea pigs will get the first of two vaccinations to be separated by 21 days.</p>
<p>First, it will be healthy adults, and if there are no immediate safety concerns, then the testing will continue with children and even babies.</p>
<p>Here's a question, though. How does a baby express informed consent when it comes to volunteering for potentially lethal medical experimentation?</p>
<p>Indeed, how could anyone qualify as "informed" who rolls up their sleeve for a vaccine being fast-tracked without the usual time-consuming safety measures?</p>
<p>But even before the tests began, the U. S. government had laid plans to use the serum for mass inoculations starting in October. In other words, it will devote approximately 20 business days to assessing not only the efficacy of the jab, but its side effects as well.</p>
<p>Would you volunteer for a job like that?</p>
<p>Call me paranoid, but I wouldn't get poked by that needle in this or any other lifetime. When it comes to the modern era's fear-induced drug marketing schemes, I have completely lost trust in the powers that be.</p>
<p>Consider the July 13 briefing put out by the World Health Organization regarding pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccines. Though it appeared under WHO's imprimatur, the recommendations were actually those of its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts, a board dominated by representatives from big pharmaceutical companies like Sanofi Pasteur, <span class="companylink">Baxter International</span> and <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> --i. e. the very vaccine manufacturers who stand to reap billions in profit from widespread administration of their product.</p>
<p>The briefing casually states, "Since the spread of the pandemic virus is considered unstoppable, vaccine will be needed in all countries." And it proposes, as a first order of business, the mandatory vaccination of all front line health care workers.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out those people are about as keen as I am to expose themselves to under-researched vaccines. Without coming right out and saying that its members would resist mandatory inoculation, the National Union of Public and General Employees has accused the media of scare-mongering on the subject of hypothetical "soaring absenteeism" caused by either caregivers who become sick themselves, or else are fearful of those they are supposed to treat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the union reminds us that on several occasions in the recent past, efforts to make certain inoculations mandatory have been defeated in this country thanks to a constitutional right to life, liberty and security of the person.</p>
<p>But it's not unreasonable to believe that there will be a continued threat to that right both here and abroad.</p>
<p>The echo chamber of the media has already sown what to many seems like a disproportionate alarm regarding swine flu. From there, it's a short hop to accusations of irresponsibility, even treason, to anyone who resists being vaccinated.</p>
<p>And the notion of making some shots mandatory?You can be certain it's a policy being discussed widely in the halls of the WHO. You know, just in case.</p>
<p>But now more than ever we need to assess vaccine safety with a far more cautious eye than the one that world governments appear to be employing. Merely consider last February's discovery that <span class="companylink">Baxter International</span>, one of the companies active in developing a pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine, had distributed another human flu vaccine to its subsidiaries that was in fact contaminated with the still live and lethal bird flu itself.</p>
<p>It was only after a Czech laboratory injected the substance into a ferret, which died immediately, that the mistake was noticed. And this was a product from an Austrian lab which supposedly holds the highest level of security.</p>
<p>The fact is that every vaccine, like every drug, has many more health consequences than are even acknowledged, much less known.</p>
<p>I for one would go to jail before I let someone shoot me up against my will. Let's hope it never comes to that.</p>

</p>
<p>Ontario is looking at the possibility that morbidly obese people who contract the H1N1 virus are more likely to suffer serious complications or death, says the province's top public-health official.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King said scientists studying the patterns of transmission of the virus have identified morbidly obese citizens as a group that might be put atop a priority distribution list for antiviral medication.</p>
<p>Last week, U. S. health officials revealed a priority list that recommended which people should be given the swine flu vaccine first, with pregnant woman topping the list; Canadian officials said they are holding off finalizing any similar list until at least September.</p>
<p>Initial data puts obese people on par with pregnant women, people living in remote northern communities, infants and people with pre-existing chronic conditions as groups particularly susceptible to the new strain of influenza.</p>
<p>King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said officials are treating the new link between obesity and H1N1 as "an emerging hypothesis" based on data coming out of the province's intensive-care units.</p>
