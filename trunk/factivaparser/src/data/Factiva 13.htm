<p>M ilt Stegall called himself Superman--and he played like a superhero over 14 years as an acrobatic slotback for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.</p>
<p>One year into retirement, the loquacious receiver is beginning to wonder if he just might have overestimated his super powers.</p>
<p>Perhaps, Stegall concedes, concussions are the proverbial Kryptonite for every football player who believes he is invincible.</p>
<p>"I'm almost 40," said Stegall, in town to cover the Grey Cup for TSN. "I have a family. They're doing all these studies on the guys in the NFL. They're dying. They're losing their memories. They're committing suicide from all these head injuries.</p>
<p>"Will any of this happen to me?"</p>
<p>Those concerns are shared by at least some of combatants set to battle Sunday in the 97th Grey Cup between the Montreal Alouettes and the Calgary Stampeders. No player wants to dwell on the possible long-term side effects of playing such a violent game--especially this week, with the championship at hand.</p>
<p>But mounting medical research points to a direct link between repeated blows to the head--in violent sports like wrestling, mixed martial arts and football--and a condition called Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE).</p>
<p>Scientists are beginning to build stronger links between the injury and some of its long-term impacts, such as depression, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease and other quality of life issues.</p>
<p>"You hope you're one of the lucky ones," says Saskatchewan tackle Gene Makowsky. "There's a chance we're going to pay later in life.</p>
<p>"You knew what you were getting into. You signed up for it. So you just hope for the best in the future."</p>
<p>Canadian Football Hall of Famer Jerry (Soupy) Campbell revealed Tuesday that he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and a severe staph infection from a hip replacement gone wrong.</p>
<p>The former Ottawa Rough Riders linebacker is 65.Doctors have told his family repeated concussions could be the cause of his memory loss.</p>
<p>"We've got young families," said Saskatchewan Roughriders slotback Jason Clermont. "Yes, we love the game. We love to sacrifice our time and our energy and a little bit of blood, sweat and tears.</p>
<p>"But we don't want to cut off a quarter of our life trying to do it."</p>
<p>Campbell's wife Kim needs to return to work Monday, but she fears leaving her husband at home to fend for himself with his body breaking down both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>The CFL Alumni Association will meet today to finalize an administrative structure for the CFL Dire Needs Fund. The hope is to have funding ready in emergency situations for former players.</p>
<p>But these are early days of the fund, and no assistance is available at this point--except in Edmonton, where the Eskimos'alumni have set up their own alumni assistance plan.</p>
<p>The players of today want some kind of safety net should their worst fears materialize and the game catches up with them later in life.</p>
<p>"I'm not so worried about the arthritis and those kinds of things," Makowsky said. "A lot of people deal with those.</p>
<p>"It's more the potential for brain injuries. That's a lot more scary to not be able to see your grandkids grow up. You want to be able to enjoy them mentally.</p>
<p>"The aches and pains, you can deal with those. The other things are a little more scary to me."</p>
<p>The American case studies are sobering. Former Philadelphia Eagles safety Andre Waters put a gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger at age 44. Former Pittsburgh Steelers guard Terry Long killed himself by drinking antifreeze at 45. Former Pittsburgh tackle Justin Strzelczyk, 36, died in a police chase after he swerved into oncoming traffic and ran into a tanker truck.</p>
<p>And retired Pittsburgh centre Mike Webster died of a massive heart attack at age 50, a sad conclusion of a life that had spiralled into homeless-ness and drug addiction.</p>
<p>Post-mortem testing found Webster, Long and Strzelczyk suffered from CTE.</p>
<p>"The whole thing with concussions is tough," Clermont said. "They tell you all the symptoms. It's like this H1N1. They tell you all these symptoms, and everyone with fever or a cough thinks they have H1N1. It's the power of suggestion.</p>
<p>"You tell people the symptoms, and they think they have them. So is the light bothering me just because it's bright?Do I have a headache just because I have a headache? Or do I have concussion?</p>
<p>"I think the only way they have been able to determine the extent of theses guys' injuries is by autopsies afterwards. It's too late then."</p>
<p>From a distance, Stegall worries about the long-term health of Buck Pierce, the B.C. Lions quarterback who suffered five concussions in the past year.</p>
<p>"He may say he's healthy and take all kinds of tests that show he's healthy," Stegall said. "But later in life, when you start having all those ill-effects, you're going to say,'Maybe I shouldn't have continued.'</p>
<p>"We're not talking football. We're talking the rest of this man's life. Will he be able to function later on with his kids, his wife and his family?</p>
<p>In the end, Clermont realizes there's inherent danger in suiting up for a professional football game. But he's more than willing to deal with whatever life has in store for him down the road.</p>
<p>"I guess you can go your life being a vegetarian, drinking water and being healthy as you can," he said. "Then you step outside one day and you get hit by a bus."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Father of flu victim urges shots; H1N1 wanes, threat lingers</b>
</div><div>Michelle Lang   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>711 words</div><div>27 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>A s nearly 50,000 Albertans head to H1N1 vaccination clinics every day, the father of a once-healthy 16-year-old with swine flu who is now on life support is urging people to join the rush for a shot.</p>
<p>Kris Gorbous, whose son Michael has been in a medically induced coma for nearly one month as he battles H1N1, worries Calgarians may get complacent about the virus as the second wave of the pandemic is waning locally.</p>
<p>But Gorbous said his son is an example of why people must remain vigilant about the new strain of influenza, which experts say targets younger victims than the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>The otherwise healthy teen contracted H1N1 before the vaccine became available, and is now on a ventilator, dialysis and a specialized device to add more oxygen into his blood.</p>
<p>Michael, who is still in a coma at Foothills Hospital, has pneumonia in both lungs and has lost 40 pounds since the ordeal began.</p>
<p>"I hear a lot of people still questioning if they should get a shot or not. I bring up Michael's case right away," Gorbous said in a telephone interview from Foothills.</p>
<p>"It's imperative that people get the shot."</p>
<p>His comments come as Alberta Health estimates 50,000 people a day are now receiving the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>A total of 850,000 people in this province have received a shot since the campaign got off to a controversial start in October, when clinics were plagued by long lineups and officials had to suspend the program due to concerns about a shortage of doses.</p>
<p>The province now has a good supply of the vaccine and earlier this week opened its H1N1 clinics to the general public.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, said people must continue to be vaccinated if the province wants to delay or minimize a third major outbreak of the virus.</p>
<p>"Our best chance of avoiding a significant third wave would be to immunize as many Albertans as possible," said Corriveau.</p>
<p>He noted the peak of the second wave of H1N1 has largely subsided in Alberta. Community settings such as schools are reporting far fewer cases and Calgary's influenza assessment centre has suspended operations after the number of patients seeking help dropped significantly.</p>
<p>The Alberta government said Thursday it is still working to distribute the vaccine in settings outside of mass clinics.</p>
<p>The province hopes to distribute doses of the vaccine to physicians by next week. It's not yet clear when shots will be available in pharmacies.</p>
<p>On Thursday, meanwhile, Alberta Health Services reported two additional deaths related to H1N1 in two Edmonton-area residents.</p>
<p>The victims were a man and a woman, both adults who had underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>A total of 54 Albertans with H1N1 have died and 1,156 people in the province have been hospitalized because of the virus.</p>
<p>In Michael Gorbous's case, the local teen became ill with H1N1 on Oct. 22. For the first few days of his illness, he had a fever and other typical symptoms of influenza.</p>
<p>Although Michael had none of the risk factors that typically predispose patients to developing serious disease from the flu, he began experiencing chest pain by the sixth day of his illness.</p>
<p>His family called an ambulance, but paramedics told them his vitals were strong and he could remain at home.</p>
<p>By Nov. 2, however, his condition deteriorated and he was admitted to Foothills Medical Centre, where doctors placed him in a medically induced coma so they could control his breathing with a respirator.</p>
<p>His father said the "resilient" teen has made some slight improvements, but he does not yet know when his son will regain consciousness.</p>
<p>"We were told this week it could be a long haul," said Kris Gorbous. "As of Sunday, it's four weeks (in hospital). It's been pretty much a nightmare."</p>

</p>
<p>w hen you're a chronic nail-biter, everyone's always sticking their fingers in your business. My elementary school teacher once asked me, "Did you know your nails are made of the same substance as a beetle's exoskeleton?", thinking that factoid would gross me out enough so that I'd quit. It didn't. I didn't. I still nibble, gnaw and chew at my fingernails like a rabid squirrel going after Mr. Peanut. My mom tried everything to nip the problem in the bud early on, to no avail. I've had my hand slapped away from my mouth by my boss, co-workers, friends, my boyfriend and complete strangers. I've been a biter as long as I can remember. After a lifetime of daily chewing, my poor nails have been bitten to the quick and beyond.</p>
<p>I don't need anyone to tell me why I should stop. Nail-biting (the medical term is onychophagia) isn't pretty, it can cause infections, it's interpreted as a sign of insecurity by others, and with H1N1 lurking on every door handle, constantly putting your fingers in your mouth is just asking for trouble. I've even developed a phobia of pointing. The last thing I want is for anybody to have a reason to look at the end of my finger. It's downright embarrassing.</p>
<p>"Lots of people bite their nails. It's nothing to be ashamed of," I tell myself, but sharing a body-focused repetitive behaviour with Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton provides little comfort. Then again, even Princess Di balled her hand into a fist when it came time to display her engagement ring, lest her raggedy nails be exposed. It's estimated that 30 percent of children and 45 percent of teenagers bite their nails. Most simply outgrow it once they reach adulthood, but not</p>
<p>everyone does.</p>
<p>With unshakable resolve and a few tricks, many kick the habit. Rubber-band bracelets are quite</p>
<p>flattering (wear red and you're in style-step with Kabbalah-practising Madonna), but</p>
<p>you have to remember to punish yourself with a snap on the wrist when you catch yourself biting. Nasty-flavoured nail polish can be effective, too. There is never a drink or mint close enough when that foul taste hits your tongue. It's like licking the inside of the cap of a bottle of nail-polish</p>
<p>remover and chasing it with a shot of lye. Tasty! Band-Aids around the fingertips beg awkward questions, as do gloves in the middle of summer, but you can't bite what you can't get at. Fake nails seem to work. Press-ons do the trick for me, but they only last a week or so. I've never had gel tips, but I hear they are tough enough to break a tooth if you try to chow down on them. Eventually, though, the falsies must come off and you're back where you started.</p>
<p>I have tried all of these methods and have succeeded in quitting three times. But then my fingers make their way into my mouth again within a few months and all that hard work and will power are for naught. Wally Muller, who owns Advance Hypnosis in Calgary, says my compulsion to chew is all in my head. Some experience in my past gave rise to an emotion that makes me want to bite, he maintains. He uses regression hypnosis to help people identify the root cause of their bad habit and overcome it. "They don't know where it came from, but they can't get rid of it," Muller says. "They know it's there, but they don't know what it is. It's called anxiety."</p>
<p>Regression therapy is only one type of hypnosis. Direct suggestion-- you've seen the shows where some unfortunate soul clucks around the stage with his arms flapping --involves the hypnotist reading a script to influence behaviour while the subject is in a trance. You can buy MP3 recordings and CDs online, and do direct-suggestion hypnosis at home. Muller says this method does work, but only temporarily. "Direct suggestion in a lot of situations is a Band-Aid. It'll fix it for a while, but then it comes back because you never really got rid of the cause."</p>
<p>Psychologists and hypnotists get along like doctors and chiropractors, but they do agree on some things. Most psychologists also think nail-biting is stress-induced. So if anxiety is to blame for the problem, then all I have to do is rid my life of stress and presto! Nails to die for. I'd also like a unicorn for Christmas and Albertans to vote for an NDP government in the next provincial election. So I'm contemplating getting what could be the final nail in the coffin of my bad habit: a mouthpiece. Custom-moulded clear covers that fit over either your top or bottom teeth are an option, as is a device primarily used to discourage thumbsucking; it has sharp bits that jab any fingers that wander into your mouth. As I also have TMJ, I'm thinking a clear cover could help me overcome two of my oral obstacles.</p>
<p>If you do manage to quit nibbling-I'm crossing my fingers for you- the hard part is keeping it up. The battle may be won, but the war is never over. Once you've stopped, buy a handful of nail files and never, ever, let yourself be caught without one. Seriously. The slightest sign of a ragged edge can undo all your hard work in a matter of minutes. Invest in some cuticle cream and a few new shades of nail polish. Flawless tips are the best defence against a relapse.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Chinese turn to garlic to ward off threat of H1N1 virus; Price of the potent bulb on the rise for use in traditional medicines as government strictly controls the limited amount of vaccine available</b>

</p>
<p>As fear of H1N1 flu grows in China, so too does the price of garlic.</p>
<p>Pandemic panic is definitely not the only reason garlic prices are soaring in Chinese markets -- the fact farmers planted only half as much as last year is the biggest factor -- but the idea of mixing the pungent bulb into traditional Chinese medical potions to ward off the flu is helping to deplete stocks in many vegetable stalls.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, garlic is selling at as much as $2 a kilo, about 50-per-cent more than just one month ago.</p>
<p>Garlic has long been considered by many to be a natural enemy of the common cold and some viral infections, but it seems to be attracting more attention as H1N1 spreads.</p>
<p>It is unclear where the latest craze of using garlic to combat H1N1 came from, but it was given a decided boost by a recent China Daily story that is now cited everywhere on the Internet.</p>
<p>The story said: "Teachers of the No. 15 High School in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, have purchased about 200 kg. of garlic which students are forced to eat every day for lunch. The school staff believe eating garlic can prevent the H1N1 flu."</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced of the efficacy of a garlic cure, however. At a local Shanghai market on downtown Julu Lu, a greengrocer surnamed Ye attests to the rise in price, but says he hasn't seen any rise in demand -- just the opposite, in fact.</p>
<p>"The sales used to be better when the price was lower," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>Ye added: "I know garlic is good and garlic can kill viruses, but honestly, I don't think it can prevent H1N1 flu."</p>
<p>Doctors and government officials are trying hard to bring people around to Ye's way of thinking. Yu Jian'er, head of Shanghai's Municipal Hospital of Traditional Medicine, told the Shanghai Morning Post that not only is garlic no substitute for China's national vaccine, it is actually "hot in nature," and should be consumed sparingly.</p>
<p>The truth is, however, that the vaccine is not available to the vast majority in China, even if they all wanted it.</p>
<p>China has enough for only seven per cent of its 1.2 billion population, so it is carefully controlling who gets inoculated.</p>
<p>At the moment, about 1.5 million Chinese are vaccinated daily, mostly health and emergency workers, primary and secondary school students and teachers, and pregnant women.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, health officials say 80 to 90 million people will be vaccinated.</p>
<p>So far, China has reported 104 swine flu-related deaths, but there are growing indications that the number is higher and that H1N1-related deaths are being wrongly reported as pneumonia.</p>
<p>There are also fears the number could begin rising faster now as H1N1 mutations take hold.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>14,800 police, security to guard Games; Another 750 police to be held in reserve in case of illnesses or increased threat level</b>
</div><div>Jeff Lee   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>671 words</div><div>27 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The RCMP-led security unit protecting the 2010 Winter Games is holding 750 police officers across Canada in reserve in case of illnesses, an H1N1 flu outbreak or an increased threat level.</p>
<p>Assistant commissioner Bud Mercer, the officer in charge of the Vancouver 2010 Integrated Security Unit, said Thursday the officers are in addition to just just over 14,800 RCMP, police, military and private security guards who will staff the Olympics starting Jan. 21.</p>
<p>"We have an additional 750 that are still out in Canada that are pre-accredited, pre-screened, pre-approved, have their packages," he said. "That's part of our contingency planning in case any number of things happen, an increase in the threat level, H1N1, people start getting sick despite our best efforts around flu shots."</p>
<p>Most of the reserves are "generalists" in the RCMP rather than specialists, the ISU said.</p>
<p>The contingency reserve is needed in part because security planners have assessed the threat level for the Olympics as low. Mercer said the ISU also managed to reduce the overall number of police officers needed for the Games to 6,015.</p>
<p>"When we talked a year and a half ago, we said [6,600 to 6,800 officers]," he said. "The numbers continued to come down as the planning matured. Do we need three people when one is enough?"</p>
<p>Mercer made the comments following an address to the annual Emergency Preparedness Conference. He said the ISU sworn-officer contingent includes more than 1,700 officers from non-RCMP police departments across the country. In addition, the ISU has 4,000 members of the Canadian Forces. Another 4,800 private security guards working for Contemporary Security Canada will operate screening services at venues. Mercer said those private guards will be overseen by RCMP officers at a four-to-one ratio.</p>
<p>The ISU's portion of the $900-million Olympic security budget is just over $490 million, and Mercer is hopeful some of that money will be left over. The overall budget includes a $135-million contingency.</p>
<p>Intelligence reports suggest there will be a number of protests across Canada along the torch relay, Mercer said, but they likely will be small events. Police had their hands full on the first day of the relay in Victoria on Oct. 30, but since then protesters have generally been respectful.</p>
<p>"I think we can already reasonably predict a couple more areas across the country where things will be a little more interesting," Mercer said. "[There are] just a few areas where we have some concerns where we will have to look closely."</p>
<p>He would not identify where he expects protests.</p>
<p>Mercer also said he believes the officers he's getting from across the country are among the best in their field and that they want to be at the Olympics.</p>
<p>Last month Cesare Vaciago, the former chief operating officer of the 2006 Turin Olympics, told The Vancouver Sun that he could have done with far fewer than the 15,000 officers he was given, including 12,000 from elsewhere in Italy. He suggested that police chiefs in other cities sent their least-qualified or unmotivated officers to Turin, and kept their best.</p>
<p>But Mercer said that's not his experience.</p>
<p>"I can't speak for Italy," he said. "The feedback I am getting is not criticism about who is coming, but who is not coming. Many of these departments have lotteries to see who is coming. Many of these departments used coming to 2010 as a perk or a reward, so I am not concerned that we are getting the less-desirables, so to speak."</p>

</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper will be going to the Copenhagen climate conference after all -- an announcement delivered Thursday, by uncanny coincidence, in the middle of a major speech on the environment by Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff.</p>
<p>So if Copenhagen accomplishes nothing else, it has at least captured the restless attention of our political leaders. And that is good, because while controversy over Afghan detainees will be old news by the end of next week, and the swine flu panic has already been downgraded to a distant irritant, the climate crisis endures.</p>
<p>True, we have been enjoying perpetual October in this part of the world, a milder-than-usual, but not unpleasant, fall. Apart from flooding on Vancouver Island, most extreme weather events have been happening elsewhere. And, while Arctic sea ice is melting at an alarming rate and threatening chaos in the permafrost, the North is off the radar for most Canadians.</p>
<p>Other worries have crowded in, mostly economic, pushing the environment down the list of voter concerns. Meanwhile, climate-change deniers (if only they were right) continue their relentless campaign to protect polluting industries, emboldened by leaked e-mails purporting to show leading climate scientists making things sound worse than they are.</p>
<p>All this has been an immense relief to the Harper government, which, always alert to public mood, has now stopped even pretending to believe in the need for urgent action. (Well, except for Transport Minister John Baird, who is a great pretender.) The real crisis, according to Environment Minister Jim Prentice, would be moving too fast.</p>
<p>"It would be ill-advised to rush though major shifts in the economy and Canadian lifestyles in the next five to 10 years," Prentice said recently, as if that was likely. Better to be prudent and wait until 2050 when we are up to our hubcaps in salt water.</p>
<p>Prentice insists Canada will not implement regulations, or, evidently, do anything concrete, until the U.S. and the rest of the world acts. He has a point: we have to harmonize our emissions trading system with the U.S., given our entwined economies.</p>
<p>Hence, the prime minister's decision to go to Copenhagen came on the heels of news that U.S. President Barack Obama will drop by the conference -- we're already moving in lock-step. But history suggests Canada will try to act as a brake on Obama's climate ambitions, not a prod.</p>
<p>That aside, Obama will commit his country to reducing emissions by 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020.</p>
<p>This is close to Canada's announced target of a 20 per cent reduction below 2006 levels by 2020 -- but with an important caveat.</p>
<p>Obama's plan, which has still to pass the Senate, would impose absolute caps on emissions, not the weaker intensity caps promised by the federal government. And the U.S. administration has promised billions to advance green technologies and energy efficiency measures. By contrast, Harper is putting his faith, and much of his money, into carbon capture and storage -- an expensive, uncertain technology that stores emissions underground, but is also used to extract more oil from depleted wells.</p>
<p>As for Ignatieff, in Quebec he unveiled his most detailed plan yet for addressing climate change -- although he avoided explicit targets. He would only say we must contain the rise in global temperatures to 2 C between now and 2050.</p>
<p>He also promised to quadruple investment in renewables, encourage energy efficiency, toughen building codes and support sustainable transportation such as high-speed rail. It is a familiar list of remedies (not unlike Obama's), which, coupled with promised hard caps, would work. Ignatieff's problem won't be his plan, but his credibility.</p>
<p>He has already evolved from a champion of a carbon tax to an oilsands booster. He rarely mentions the environment in question period. This sudden policy download looks more a new strategy, from his new team, than a heart-felt commitment.</p>
<p>For environmentalists, only Quebec is a bright spot. It promises to cut emissions by 20 per cent over 1990 levels by 2020, the most ambitious targets on the continent. Premier Jean Charest even won endorsement from <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto Alcan</span> CEO Jacynthe Côté. "It won't be easy," she said, "but Quebec businesses are with you."</p>
<p>Of course, Quebec is a major exporter of clean hydro power, so the costs of going green aren't as dire as they would be for Alberta. But an enlightened federal government, with a coherent energy strategy, would encourage export of electricity over oil -- and ensure that benefits, and penalties, are shared. Instead, Harper appears intent on extracting every last drop from the tarsands before turning his attention to climate change.</p>
<p>"If we in Canada, and in Quebec, want others to act, we need to accept that we have to act also," Charest said. That, for those unfamiliar with the concept, is leadership.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Into China's smog, a green giant rises; The Pearl River Tower in the country's industrial hub is slated to become one of the world's most energy-efficient office buildings</b>

</p>
<p>GUANGHZHOU, CHINA -- In an artist's rendition, the Pearl River Tower soars above the Guangzhou skyline looking like a cross between a flattened rocket ship and a cellphone.</p>
<p>Still a half-completed, hulking concrete shell, the 71-storey building in China's southern industrial hub is billed to become one of the world's greenest office towers when it's finished late next year.</p>
<p>“We believe it will be the most energy-efficient tower in the world,” said Roger Frechette, an engineer and the Chicago-based director of sustainable engineering with Skidmore Owings and Merrill LLP (SOM), the U.S. firm that designed the building and is overseeing its construction.</p>
<p>“Hopefully it will be the first of many built in the world. We really need them now,” Mr. Frechette said in an interview during one of his many trips to Guangzhou. He calls the 2.2-million-square-foot tower “the project of a lifetime.”</p>
<p>Though the total cost of the building has not been disclosed, it will use about $13-million (U.S.) in environmental technologies and adaptations, including wind turbines to supply its power, and heat-saving and cooling technologies to minimize the amount of electricity consumed. The tower's top 10 floors are to serve as the headquarters of the state-government-affiliated Guangdong Tobacco Co., with additional office space to be leased later.</p>
<p>The state affiliation has allowed the designers to test what they believe is a new frontier in sustainable construction, which they say at present may be possible only in China. While the recession has slowed building work in other booming centres such as Dubai (where SOM was the architect behind the spindle-like Burj Dubai skyscraper), massive government spending in China has kept the cranes operating.</p>
<p>Until recently, environmental concerns have taken a back seat to the incredible pace of development in China, where the government has resisted accepting targets to limit carbon emissions ahead of next month's UN climate summit in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>But there is increasing interest in the use of green technologies. Under law, China is required to produce 15 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. The 2006 law is driving the construction of massive wind farms, the world's biggest plant to convert sunlight to electricity, and an entire city – Ordos in Inner Mongolia – built on the concept of sustainable living.</p>
<p>In Beijing, developments such as the Modern MOMA office and residential complex include geothermal heating, wastewater recycling to feed its surrounding gardens, and a specialized indoor ventilation system.</p>
<p>But the Pearl River Tower is seen as one of China's most experimental buildings yet.</p>
<p>“When we first put the design together, we had a lot of people look at it, even in our own firm, who said, ‘You're wasting your time. China's not really interested in sustainability,' ” Mr. Frechette recalls.</p>
<p>“A lot of people made that assumption and I think it's wrong. … In the last few years, we've seen China get very aggressive on sustainability.”</p>
<p>Initially, the tower was designed to be a “zero-energy” structure, meaning it would produce as much power as it consumed using a series of wind turbines. Though that design had to be modified to fit local regulations, the tower will still use half as much power as regular office buildings for heating and cooling, ventilation and lighting.</p>
<p>Two floors of the tower will have wind turbines built inside; the building is designed to funnel the prevailing winds in through openings in its walls to keep the turbines running.</p>
<p>Double windows and automated window shades will help regulate the temperature; rooms will be cooled using chilled water run through copper pipes, saving space over traditional air conditioning systems.</p>
<p>The architects also promise that the cutting-edge ventilation system will produce better indoor air quality, a key issue in China where air pollution and outbreaks of airborne viruses such as H1N1 and, in years past, SARS are major concerns.</p>
<p>Opinions are mixed as to whether the tower will live up to its billing. “China's green technology must fit with China-specific conditions,” cautioned Qin Youguo, a professor in the School of Architecture at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University.</p>
<p>“Being green here means the technology helps people in harmony with nature in a low-energy and sustainable way,” Prof. Qin said. “What works as green technology in another country may not be green in China if it doesn't fit the situation here.”</p>
<p>While Prof. Qin criticized many of the efforts thus far as showpieces with little real impact, others in the industry say real progress is being made. Architects say Chinese developers' interest in green concepts such as water recycling and energy efficiency is growing, and that clients are also calling for such ideas in project proposals.</p>
<p>“Generally, I can feel more interest of Chinese developers on the green concepts, such as environmentally friendly, power-saving, water-saving, low-carbon-emission [designs], especially in the last couple of years,” said Ma Weijun, assistant chief engineer at Shanghai-based East China Architectural Design and Research Institute Co. (ECADI), one of China's leading architectural firms. “Sometimes, it is the clients' requests but we also guide our clients in this way. I can feel the change through our clients,” Mr. Ma said.</p>

<p>MD skeptical as H1N1 shots allowed at workplaces</p>
<p>While public health units in the Greater Toronto Area are shutting down some H1N1 flu assessment centres and mass vaccination clinics, the province is finally allowing workplaces to provide the shot to employees.</p>
<p>The move has prompted Dr. Richard Schabas to charge that the province is trying to unload vaccine because the worst of the pandemic is over. Schabas is Ontario's former chief medical officer and currently medical officer of health in Prince Edward and Hastings counties.</p>
<p>A formal announcement from the Ontario health ministry on workplace clinics is expected at a news conference Friday.</p>
<p>Cleared Creba accused gets bail</p>
<p>Andre Thompson, one of four men acquitted this week of manslaughter in Jane Creba's Boxing Day 2005 slaying, was granted bail Thursday on his still outstanding charge of possessing one of the guns used in the shootout.</p>
<p>Bear scare spurs zoo inspection</p>
<p>After reports that a grizzly bear nearly broke out of its pen at the Toronto Zoo Tuesday, a Ministry of Labour official was sent Thursday to inspect conditions at the zoo.</p>
<p>A senior zookeeper said the bear was within an hour of breaking loose but zoo management denied there was ever a threat the bear would escape.</p>
<p>Talks aim to avert rail strike</p>
<p>Federal mediators hope Friday's talks between the Canadian National Railway and the union representing its locomotive engineers will avert a strike that could begin Saturday.</p>
<p>Although <span class="companylink">GO Transit</span> leases portions of CN's track, the labour dispute does not involve any passenger trains.</p>
<p>The Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, which represents 12,000 railway workers - including the 1,700 engineers who have been without a contract for the last year - sent CN a 72-hour strike notice Wednesday.</p>
<p>Man on bus shot in shoulder</p>
<p>Police say a 25-year-old man on a TTC bus in Downsview was shot by someone in the street Thursday night. The shooting happened around 9: 15 p.m. in the Jane St. and Sheppard Ave. area.</p>
<p>The man was rushed to hospital with a wound to his shoulder, police said.</p>

<p>THE H1N1 outbreak hasn't been bad enough yet to trigger the launch of a new crew of community paramedics slated to roam the city in station wagons.</p>
<p>The one-man units, tentatively called the primary treatment and referral service (PTRS), will be more like nurses who make house calls. They'll be able to triage and treat some of the thousands of non-life-threatening cases called in to 911 every year -- everything from worrisome flu to sprained ankles, diabetes and seizures.</p>
<p>But the city's deal with the province says the new cars can't be launched until call volumes get high.</p>
<p>For about the last two weeks, call volumes have been about normal, despite H1N1. There are about 200 to 225 medical calls a day. The trigger to launch the PTRS medics is 300 calls a day for three days in a row.</p>

<p>Local scientists are working on a portable, low-cost device that will quickly detect whether someone has -- or has had -- H1N1.</p>
<p>The researchers, who won a $5,000 local innovation award for their work last week, say the biochip sensor will allow a non-medical person to detect the flu virus in an hour for as little as $10 per test. Using current technology, such tests can cost a few hundred dollars each, they say.</p>
<p>The scientists also claim the portable device they are developing can be calibrated to detect antibodies indicating the onset of other infectious diseases like SARS, HIV and hepatitis B.</p>
<p>"This could be used in cancer detection," project leader Michael Zhang, a provincial biomedical engineer and an adjunct professor at the University of Winnipeg, said Thursday. "Someone could (conduct the test) at home or use it through their family physician's office."</p>
<p>Last week, Zhang and his colleagues won a local challenge event for innovators and entrepreneurs patterned on the model used for CBC's Dragon Den, defeating four other teams. Other members of his group include U of W computer scientist Simon Liao, electrical engineer Bin Huang and University of Manitoba biophysicist Francis Lin.</p>
<p>They will use the prize money and kick in some of their own to build a prototype of the hand-held device, which screens for specific diseases using a saliva test. After that, they'll need considerably more funding to conduct clinical trials to prove the device works before it is approved by agencies such as Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief public health officer, said such diagnostic devices have potential benefits, as long as they're used appropriately and are accurate.</p>
<p>"For a surveillance tool, this could be quite useful and, if it was accurate enough, might be useful for someone who has no symptoms to ask the question, 'Do I need to get a flu shot?' " Kettner said Thursday.</p>
<p>But it's a different situation if you're using it to make a medical decision on an individual who is ill, he said. "You don't want a test that gets it wrong half the time when it says you've got H1N1..."</p>

<p>Multi-excusing</p>
<p>Jake Goertzen (For sins of others, Nov. 24) is the quintessential Winnipeg driver: he just "knows" that he is "better equipped to handle" driving; it's everyone else who is the problem. It would be funny if it weren't so likely to cause an accident.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a "good multi-tasker," only people who think they are and use that as an excuse to distract themselves with technology while driving.</p>
<p>Goertzen should feel free to smoke if he's convinced that his lungs are magically invulnerable, or jump off a tall building if he believes that gravity doesn't apply to him. The rest of us, however, should pay attention to proven risks and not talk or text while driving, which will be safer for everyone on the roads -- including him.</p>

<p>Where is the love?</p>
<p>We live in a society where two per cent of the population owns over 50 per cent of its wealth. There are multi-millionaires that have people waiting on them hand and foot. Yet there are people living in the streets of Winnipeg, constantly looking for food and shelter. Does this not seem inhumane to anyone else? Where has humanity gone, where is the love?</p>
<p>I've noticed that in the news there are more and more articles that generate fear, be it H1N1, global warming, the recession, the war on terrorism, gang violence, murders. Fear resonates in the left side of the brain and we have become a society of left brain thinkers. The left brain is also responsible for logic, rules, laws and structure. Yup, that sounds like society. The right side of the brain is responsible for emotion, intuition, faith, creativity and love. The problems that are going on in our minds are direct reflections of the problems going on in society. We are quite literally losing our ability to love.</p>
<p>I think the biggest change we need in society is to get rid of our current monetary system. We are told we live in a free society, yet every country in the world is in debt to central banks. Since when is debt freedom? I feel that the entire economy is a Ponzi scheme and it's designed to keep the rich rich and the poor poor. Money is the sole reason we have poverty. Our society needs to evolve beyond money.</p>
<p>I dream of a day when humanity realizes we are not all different and that we are the same, when humanity finally unites as one and there is peace on Earth. I guess it's no surprise my favourite song is Imagine by John Lennon. Now I just have one question: Where is the love?</p>

<p>Disturbing silence</p>
<p>The silence of Manitoba Conservative Leader Hugh McFadyen on the issue of harmonizing sales and GST in our province is disturbing. Instead of agreeing with NDP politicians that harmonization solely benefits business to the detriment of consumers, McFadyen harps on the hypocritical position that Manitoba MLAs don't have enough official sitting dates in the Legislature (despite the fact Conservative Alberta and B.C. spend significantly less sitting time in their own legislatures).</p>
<p>In fact, Manitoba electors should interpret silence or a lack of a position on harmonization as an indicator McFadyen would impose such a tax on Manitobans it elected, in order to please his business associates.</p>

<p>The rule of law</p>
<p>If the United States has a case against Omar Khadr it should present it in a proper court of law and not the kangaroo court that's been prepared for him. If the U.S. cannot present a case against him, no doubt because there is no evidence, then the U.S. should release him. Now I'm no lawyer, but without habeas corpus there is no rule of law, and without rule of law there is no civilization. Embrace tyranny and you are in no position to criticize other countries for their human rights violations. All of them can cite grave dangers to public safety by dispensing with the rule of law.</p>

<p>Smoke gets in your life</p>
<p>I fully agree with the sentiments expressed by Sheila Welbergen (Stubble burning spoils, Nov. 16). With all the concern about global warming, stubble burning, manure piles smouldering, and fires polluting the air, something must be done to curtail the amount of smoke that we must breathe. What does all this smoke do to the atmosphere?</p>
<p>I also am affected by this type of smoke and must spend most of my time indoors. I sometimes have to drive to Winnipeg to get away from the stench of the smoke.</p>
<p>In a small town, this does not improve even in the winter as many people have begun to heat their homes with the wood that has not been seasoned.</p>

<p>As of Dec. 23 through New Year's, the Addictions Foundation of Manitoba will be shutting its doors. Is this not the place you go to get help? To close it, especially over the holidays would be unforgivable. The AFM is their safety net. They feel like family there. Why are they closing the doors?</p>
<p>To save $50,000.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but it just doesn't make sense to close. To close the doors to a place for addicts in the holiday season, where there's celebrating going on all over. No it just doesn't make any sense. It's just heartless.</p>
<p>Has the government sunk so low that it's more important to find money for material things but no money for the most vulnerable and helpless people who need our help?</p>
<p>But we, the people, the government, have to save money. Well, I'm ashamed to be in that category.</p>

</p>
<p>ROME -- Silvio Berlusconi's alleged passion for beautiful young actresses and underwear models may set the Italian Prime Minister back hundreds of millions of dollars, if his estranged wife gets her way.</p>
<p>Veronica Lario, who is seeking legal separation from Mr. Berlusconi, is demanding €43-million a year in maintenance payments, the equivalent of $68-million (Canadian), or $5.6-million a month, the Italian media reported yesterday. If the amount is granted, it would rank as one of the biggest divorce settlements in history.</p>
<p>The national newspaper Il Corriere della Sera said the billionaire, centre-right politician considers the demand “exorbitant” and has offered Ms. Lario a settlement between €200,000 and €300,000 a month to keep her swanky lifestyle intact. Lawyers for Ms. Lario and Mr. Berlusconi, 73, neither confirmed nor denied the amounts.</p>
<p>Ms. Lario, a 53-year-old former actress, is Mr. Berlusconi's second wife. He became infatuated with her 30 years ago, when he saw her perform topless in a play in Milan called The Magnificent Cuckold. They have three children; he has two others from his first marriage.</p>
<p>To the delight of newspaper editors from London to Rome, their marriage blew up in May, when Ms. Lario said she could no longer stick with a man “who frequents minors.” Her outburst came shortly after Mr. Berlusconi's friendship with aspiring Neapolitan actress Noemi Letizia broke in the press.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister had attended her 18th birthday party and gave her a diamond and gold necklace. While he has never denied his friendship with Ms. Letizia, he has never explained how he met her.</p>
<p>Ms. Lario went on to accuse her husband of “shamelessly trashy” behaviour for his penchant for choosing gorgeous showgirls as Italy's candidates for the European Parliament elections. One of his favourite beauties, Mara Carfagna, once a topless model, was appointed Minister for Equal Opportunities in the Berlusconi government.</p>
<p>The birthday party scandal proved to be the start of a volcanic series of bimbo eruptions that have yet to end. The latest came this week, when Patrizia D'Addario, the former call girl and model who claims she had sex with the Prime Minister last year in his Rome palace, published her memoir of the relationship (Mr. Berlusconi says he can't remember meeting her and has never paid for sex).</p>
<p>The book is called Prime Minister, Take Your Pleasure, a title inspired by the famous line spoken by a prostitute to an aristocrat in the Fellini film Amarcord. At one point, she says she and other showgirls were taken to a salon in the palace. “I was watching the whole thing with curiosity and my first thought was that I'd found myself in a harem,” she wrote. “He was on the couch and all of us, 20 girls, were at his disposition … Having been an escort I thought I'd seen a few things, but this I'd never seen, 20 women for one man.”</p>
<p>Impressed by his flamboyant lifestyle and lavish parties, the Italian edition of Rolling Stone magazine this week named Mr. Berlusconi “rock star of the year.”</p>
<p>Even though Mr. Berlusconi is a billionaire – Forbes magazine ranks him Italy's second-richest man and 70th in the world – payments as big as the ones demanded by Ms. Lario could damage his empire. His holdings include <span class="companylink">Mediaset</span>, Italy's main commercial broadcaster, the AC Milan football team, Modadori, Italy's biggest publishing house, and a variety of property, insurance and film distribution businesses.</p>
<p>The divorce is bound to increase the odds that the carve-up of his empire among his five children becomes messy. Ms. Lario has no stake in Mr. Berlusconi's main holding company, Fininvest, but her three children are all members of the board and each owns a 7 per cent stake.</p>
<p>The most expensive divorce settlement is thought to be $1.7-billion (U.S.), the amount in assets reportedly paid by media mogul Rupert Murdoch to his former wife, Anna, in 1999. At the rate she's requesting, Ms. Lario would have to receive 26 years of alimony to reach that sum.</p>
<p>BY THE NUMBERS</p>
<p>It's $7,762 for every hour of every day.</p>
<p>It's 0.1 per cent of Silvio Berlusconi's estimated net worth of $6.8-billion</p>
<p>If stacked as dollar bills one atop the other, it would form a tower 125 times as high as the Leaning Tower of Pisa.</p>

<p>A recent newspaper headline read, Researchers look to common, cheap medications to help H1N1 patients. Viral experts are wondering whether cholesterol-lowering drugs and steroids could help to save the sickest H1N1 patients. If these researchers studied history, they would learn how Dr. Frederick R. Klenner saved an important patient, and many others, from life-threatening viral infections.</p>
<p>In The Clinical Guide to the use of Vitamin C, Dr. Lendon Smith details Klenner's clinical experiences. Dr. Klenner had cured case after case of viral disease by massive doses of vitamin C. And when you read these cases, it boggles the mind why this research has collected so much dust.</p>
<p>Fifty-six years ago, a seven-year-old boy had been ill for six weeks due to recurring attacks of influenza. He had been treated with sulfa, penicillin and five to 10,000 milligrams of oral vitamin C. But he suddenly dropped into a stupor. Dr. Klenner quickly gave him an intravenous injection of 6,000 mg of vitamin C. Five minutes later, the boy was awake and asked, "What happened?" He received three further injections of vitamin C every six hours and was fully recovered in 24 hours. The patient was Dr. Klenner's son.</p>
<p>Dr. Klenner was an American researcher and family practitioner in North Carolina. In 1949, he reported this momentous news to the American Medical Association. During the epidemic of poliomyelitis, he had cured all 60 patients suffering from this disease by using massive doses of vitamin C, sometimes 300,000 mg daily. None had been left with any paralysis. Yet no one appears to have listened to him.</p>
<p>This was the same year I developed polio in my final year at Harvard medical school. But none of its distinguished professors ever considered, or even knew about, the use of vitamin C in treating viral disease. And as far as I know, 60 years later neither they nor other doctors are aware of this fact.</p>
<p>In February 1948, Klenner reported in the journal Southern Medicine and Surgery 42 cases of viral pneumonia treated by vitamin C. Other doctors were using X-rays as therapy! His treatment was 1,000 mg of vitamin C every six hours for mild cases. Three to seven injections were required for clinical recovery. In 1951, in the same journal he reported vitamin C could cure measles and chicken pox in 24 hours.</p>
<p>In June 1957, Dr. Klenner reported in the Tri-State Medical Journal what he called the "insidious virus". He described the case of a 19-month-old baby who had a minor cold for two weeks. Then suddenly, instead of improving, the child became cold to touch, semi-comatose, his arms and legs completely paralyzed. Two thousand mg of vitamin C were injected on admission to the hospital and 1,000 more one hour later. Then, 1,000 mg were given orally every four hours. In eight hours, the baby started to recover and the paralysis disappeared.</p>
<p>Dr. Klenner's message was simple. If a serious infection is present, but the cause unknown, doctors should prescribe large doses of vitamin C while they're pondering the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Moreover, just as a small dose of a narcotic will not stop cancer pain, neither will a small dose of vitamin C stop viral disease. But are there any doctors who treat desperately ill H1N1 patients willing to prescribe large doses of vitamin C?</p>

<p>WINNIPEG researchers will test to see whether smokers or children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk of falling severely ill from H1N1.</p>
<p>Dr. Sat Sharma, director of respiratory labs at St. Boniface General Hospital, said smoking is one potential H1N1 risk factor that hasn't been studied, and may give researchers another clue as to why H1N1 causes severe illness in some and relatively mild sickness in others.</p>
<p>Sharma is part of a team of local researchers who recently received a federal grant to study how H1N1 attacks the body differently than seasonal influenza. While scientists know that certain risk factors, among them pregnancy and aboriginal ancestry, put people at a higher risk of severe illness from H1N1, they still do not know why.</p>
<p>Sharma said researchers will analyze cells from the blood and lungs of Manitobans hospitalized with severe H1N1 along with samples from people who experienced a mild bout of flu in the first or second flu wave.</p>
<p>The tests could allow scientists to tease out what protects some people against severe H1N1 and predisposes others to it.</p>
<p>"(Smoking) appears to be one factor not identified previously," Sharma said. "We'll be looking at that in a lot more detail."</p>
<p>The study began Oct. 1 and is part of a cross-country research project to learn more about how H1N1 attacks the lungs. Winnipeg scientists are collaborating with researchers in Toronto, Vancouver and Halifax to investigate how the virus works, along with what role genetics and environment play in how it infects the body.</p>
<p>Sharma and a group of Winnipeg researchers are leading the national effort, in part because of the large number of severe H1N1 cases that surfaced across the province earlier this spring. The clusters of severe H1N1 cases among Manitoba First Nations caught the attention of the World Health Organization, and at its peak, 38 Manitobans were on ventilators in intensive care and seven people died.</p>
<p>So far, more than 1,200 confirmed cases have been reported in the second wave and two people died. As of Wednesday, four adults with severe H1N1 were hospitalized in city intensive care units, including two who were on ventilators.</p>
<p>Dr. Beni Sahai, senior scientist and virologist at Cadham Provincial Laboratory in Winnipeg, said it's crucial to learn more about the virus since H1N1 is quickly becoming the dominant flu strain. Old strains of influenza die off as new ones emerge, Sahai said, and H1N1 will soon replace the previous seasonal influenza strain.</p>
<p>While seasonal influenza is typically confined to the upper respiratory tract, Sahai said H1N1 progresses to the lower respiratory tract in the lungs and causes serious problems. Sahai said researchers need to understand why that is in order to figure out how to stop the progression of severe disease.</p>
<p>Scientists plan to follow patients for a year or longer to examine the long-term effects of H1N1 on the body.</p>
<p>"This one is here for good," Sahai said. "The previous seasonal flu virus is rapidly being replaced by this virus."</p>
<p>So far, 12 H1N1 patients are enrolled in the Winnipeg study, including eight people who fell severely ill.</p>
<p>Anyone who has fallen ill with a mild case of H1N1 who would like to be a part of the study can phone 235-3581.</p>

<p>The RCMP-led security unit protecting the 2010 Winter Games is holding 750 police officers across Canada in reserve in case there's an H1N1 flu outbreak, other illnesses or a perceived security threat that requires their presence.</p>
<p>Assistant Commissioner Bud Mercer, the officer in charge of the Vancouver 2010 Integrated Security Unit, said Thursday the officers are in addition to more than 6,000 RCMP and police officers who will staff the Olympics starting Jan. 21.</p>
<p>"We have an additional 750 that . . . are pre-accredited, pre-screened, pre-approved, have their packages," he said. "That's part of our contingency planning in case any number of things happen: An increase in the threat level, H1N1, people start getting sick despite our best efforts around flu shots."</p>
<p>Most of those are "generalists" in the RCMP rather than specialists, the Integrated Security Unit said.</p>
<p>Mercer said the unit had also managed to reduce the overall number of security personnel needed for the Games.</p>
<p>"When we talked a year and a half ago, we said (6,600 to 6,800 officers)," he said after his address to the annual Emergency Preparedness Conference in Vancouver. "The numbers continued to come down as the planning matured. Do we need three people when one is enough?"</p>

</p>
<p>It took until the second visit, but we finally met a gang worth writing home about -- the beloved Melbourne meerkats.</p>
<p>Sarah, my girlfriend, and I returned to the Melbourne Zoo a few days after our first visit upon seeing an advertised unique "photo experience" with the little creatures.</p>
<p>Who wouldn't spend $29 for a few minutes with the African animals, propelled to fame in the recent documentary series Meerkat Manor.</p>
<p>We took the tram into the city under Melbourne's grey winter skies.</p>
<p>Picked up from the middle of the road, the tram then cut through Royal Park, taking us on brief but greeny tour. We soon jumped off and with big smiles announced our intentions.</p>
<p>"We're here to see the meerkats!" we told the cashier, handing him our ticket for the 11:30 a.m. photo experience.</p>
<p>We had some time to kill, so we settled in for a spot on a park bench. It took everything in us to not chuckle when a few other tourists passed by wearing medical masks. Perhaps they were scared the meerkats had swine flu?</p>
<p>The zoo photographer joined us and a mum with her two kids, growing ever more impatient as they waited. I asked the photographer what was the most popular photo experience.</p>
<p>Sure, you could book a typical Aussie tourism photo with a kangaroo or even hug a koala, but it seemed the meerkat exhibit was always their busiest.</p>
<p>I figured it has to do with the Australian mateship they display. In a gang of 15 to 20, meerkats are intensely loyal and value their friendships.</p>
<p>There's always one of them standing tall on the lookout, scanning the skies for enemies and yelping out one of 20 possible calls when trouble arrives -- all taking turns in this important duty.</p>
<p>That, and they're so adorable, like tiny, cuddly teddy bears. They even have little beady brown eyes.</p>
<p>The zookeeper arrived a few minutes late with a bucket half-full of live mealworms. Our hearts sank a bit when she said we weren't allowed to pet the meerkats as they can find it quite threatening.</p>
<p>We were led in behind their enclosure and, like excited pet dogs, the meerkats were already poking their noses at the door trying to be the first to see us and -- more than likely -- the first to be fed.</p>
<p>We let the mum and her children go first, and in return she gave us a line to dazzle our friends with.</p>
<p>"It's like lollies for them," she said of the worms, laughing as the meerkats scurried around her children while we watched eagerly from a distance.</p>
<p>It was then our turn and we tiptoed past the meerkat mound of sandy tunnels and plunked ourselves down on a wooden bench.</p>
<p>Other tourists pointed at us as the zookeeper placed a handful of sticky worms in our palms.</p>
<p>We were quickly swarmed by the meerkat gang. They crawled all over our thighs and their little paws had long black claws that dig curiously at our fingers.</p>
<p>No man could keep a straight face in such a scenario.</p>
<p>This was a crew that would snap up every last wriggly worm, using their noses to sniff out every hiding place and tickling you in the process.</p>
<p>The photographer clicked away at our glee as the wormy feast caused the meerkats to tumble and grunt around us.</p>
<p>Their soft speckled fur rubbed up against our jackets and an odd musky smell drifted through the air.</p>
<p>One excited meerkat then dove headfirst between our legs, its stubby tail furiously vibrating as it found a rouge worm on the bench. He slurped it back and then looked at me like it wanted one more.</p>
<p>We tried to stall the zookeeper so we could stay a bit longer by asking her plenty of questions, but she seemed intent on keeping things on schedule.</p>
<p>We did find out that meerkats are very curious mammals and the zookeeper often hid the worms in toys or in nearby logs so they run back and forth looking for them.</p>
<p>"Anything that's new they want to know about," she said</p>
<p>We listened to the zookeeper's short talk afterwards about their lifestyle.</p>
<p>Did you know that in each gang of meerkats, there is only one female who is allowed to breed and others will be punished by the group if they do?</p>
<p>On our way out we headed through the zoo gift shop but didn't find the one expected meerkat gift: a copy of the Lion King song "Hakuna Matata."</p>
<p>Timon, the animated meerkat voiced by actor Nathan Lane, had belted out that tune in the classic <span class="companylink">Disney</span> movie and taught us years ago that it meant "no worries."</p>
<p>It hadn't dawned on us until then that the meerkat song is therefore an unofficial Australian anthem, meaning these furry critters could really be mates.</p>
<p>The meerkat experience runs daily at 11:30 a.m.</p>
<p>You can also check out the zoo's other animal experiences online at www.zoo.org.au[http://www.zoo.org.au].</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Snowbirds get flu shots down south; Not in priority group at home</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>

</p>
<p>Canadian snowbirds who couldn't get their H1N1 shot before they headed south for the winter got it with ease when they arrived in Florida.</p>
<p>One of those snowbirds, Issie Caron, said he went to a public clinic in Montreal several weeks ago but was denied the shot because he is 79 years old. For the first few weeks of immunization programs across the country the vaccine was only offered to people in high-priority groups, and senior citizens were not among them. Now, clinics have opened up to the general public in many places, but it was too late for Caron and others like him who had already left Canada for warmer climates.</p>
<p>"They wouldn't consider giving us our shots at all in Montreal," he said by phone from his winter home in Fort Lauderdale where he spends four months a year. Instead, he was given an information sheet with phone numbers and locations of where he could get the vaccine in Florida, including at Walgreens stores for a fee of $30. Soon after landing in Fort Lauderdale, Caron learned of an H1N1 clinic at the National Guard Armory not far from his home that was giving the shots to everyone, not just priority groups.</p>
<p>On the day Caron showed up last week, he waited in a short line and had no problem getting the shot.</p>
<p>"They gave it to anybody that had an American address. It was very nice of them," said Caron. He did not have to show a health card and the vaccine was free of charge.</p>
<p>"There was no hassle. It's not like it was in Montreal where you had to wait an hour or two hours," said Caron. "I think it's beautiful."</p>
<p>A few days later, fellow snowbird friends arrived from Montreal and Caron drove all of them to the clinic so they could get vaccinated as well.</p>
<p>Tim O'Connor, spokesman for the Palm Beach County health unit, said there is no way to verify how many Canadians have received their vaccinations in south Florida.</p>
<p>"They are winter residents here and they own homes here. I can't say that they are Canadian or not, we don't ask citizenship," he said.</p>
<p>One resident of Fort Lauderdale quoted in the local paper wasn't too keen on Canadians taking up space in line and getting a vaccine that has been in short supply in some areas.</p>
<p>"Is this open to the world? That's our vaccine that our taxpayers have paid for. They're not citizens," one man told the Sun Sentinel newspaper.</p>
<p>But Caron said no one seemed upset when he was at the Armory for the needle. He also wants his seasonal flu shot and it wasn't available in Montreal either before he left for Florida. Quebec was the only province that put off its seasonal flu shot campaign entirely until after the H1N1 campaign is finished. Other provinces offered the shot to senior citizens during October.</p>
<p>Caron said he will be getting his seasonal flu shot on Dec. 7 at a clinic in his condominium and will pay $18 for it.</p>
<p>Pam Maher, spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of Retired Persons, said the organization heard a lot of feedback about senior citizens not being in the H1N1 priority groups. "There was a lot of fuss about that and we did receive a lot of complaints," she said.</p>
<p>Public health authorities say people over age 65 with no underlying medical conditions do not appear to be at high risk of catching the H1N1 virus or of developing serious complications from it.</p>
<p>The Canadian Snowbird Association estimates that about 200,000 Canadians spend more than three months of the winter in southern states. The group is urging Canadians to get their seasonal and H1N1 shots here if they can before leaving.</p>
<p>"There have been reports, particularly in south Florida, that the shot is available. But it's sporadic, it depends where you are and there's no guarantee you're going to get it if you head to Florida," said Michael MacKenzie, communications officer for the group. "We still think it's a good idea to sit tight for a week or two, get vaccinated and then head."</p>

</div><div>The Leader-Post</div>

</p>
<p>Here is some H1N1 information from www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca], a Health Canada website, where you will be able to find out more about the flu.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is a new strain of pandemic influenza that is different from the seasonal flu. People have no natural immunity to protect against this virus. The H1N1 flu virus emerged in April 2009 and surveillance of its spread shows that it is affecting more young and healthy people than the regular seasonal flu, which normally affects seniors and young children. People with underlying medical conditions, and pregnant women, may be at a greater risk for severe illness.</p>
<p>WHAT IS IT?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus -- also known as human swine influenza -- is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs. This virus usually affects pigs, but has been transferred to humans.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus has caused primarily mild illness in Canada, but Canadians need to be prepared to respond to a potentially more severe form of the virus that may emerge this fall.</p>
<p>HOW IS IT SPREAD?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is contagious and is spread the same way as regular seasonal influenza. This happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes and their germs enter the nose, eyes, or throat of another person. The germs can also rest on hard surfaces such as counters and doorknobs, and can be picked up on hands and transmitted to the respiratory system when someone touches his mouth and/or nose. It is not possible to catch it by eating pork or pork products or through blood transfusions.</p>
<p>CONTAGIOUSNESS</p>
<p>More research is being done on how long a person can be infectious (be able to spread the virus to others), but it is believed that this period is for one day before the onset of symptoms and continues for approximately seven days after symptoms have started. The time it takes between being infected and experiencing symptoms is between two and seven days.</p>
<p>SYMPTOMS</p>
<p>- ALMOST ALWAYS</p>
<p>Cough and fever</p>
<p>- COMMON</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle aches</p>
<p>Sore throat</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>Decreased appetite</p>
<p>Runny nose</p>
<p>- SOMETIMES</p>
<p>Nausea</p>
<p>Vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>- Wash hands often.</p>
<p>- Keep common surfaces disinfected.</p>
<p>- Cough and sneeze into your arm, instead of into your hand.</p>
<p>- If you are sick, stay home until your symptoms are gone and you feel well enough to participate in all activities.</p>
<p>- If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant, have underlying health problems, or if your symptoms get worse, contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>TREATMENT</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant or have underlying health problems contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are otherwise healthy, you should stay home to recover. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience difficulty breathing or serious shortness of breath, it is important to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Antivirals are drugs used for the early treatment of influenza. If taken shortly after getting sick (within 48 hours), they can reduce influenza symptoms, shorten the length of illness and potentially reduce the serious complications of influenza. Antivirals do not prevent you from getting sick.</p>
<p>Canada has a National Antiviral Stockpile of 55 million doses of two antiviral drugs -- Tamiflu and Relenza. Both are effective in treating H1N1 flu virus. This stockpile is enough for all Canadians who will need and want treatment.</p>
<p>Antivirals are recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe illness, and for people at risk of severe disease. Your doctor will decide if treatment is right for you.</p>
<p>VACCINATION</p>
<p>Influenza vaccines (also called flu shots) help you to prevent getting sick by introducing your body to a weakened or dead version of the virus to teach your body to build immunity to it.</p>

<p>Forewarned is forearmed.</p>
<p>Reginans who are planning to get their H1N1 flu shot this afternoon can expect to have a longer wait because there will be fewer public health nurses at the former Robert Usher Collegiate, located at 1440 9th Ave. N.</p>
<p>"Many of the public health nurses will be attending the funeral for a public health nursing co-worker," said Mark Torjusen, spokesman with the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region. "This may result in longer waits during the afternoon."</p>
<p>He added that full staffing will resume at Usher from 6 p.m. until the clinic closes at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>On Thursday, 14 nurses were at the former high school. Torjusen expects that number will drop to nine for about three hours this afternoon.</p>
<p>Despite the clinic being busy, Torjusen said it appears everything is going smoothly.</p>
<p>"I've not heard about any issues," he said.</p>
<p>As of 2 p.m. on Thursday, about 1,100 people were vaccinated for the H1N1 and seasonal influenza. Their wait ranged from 11/2 to two hours.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, 3,744 people were vaccinated for the H1N1 virus and another 268 received the seasonal influenza shot. In the schools that day, 1,265 students were vaccinated.</p>
<p>The Usher clinic will be open on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.</p>

</div><div>L. Ian Macdonald   </div>

<div>731 words</div><div>27 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Most Quebecers, like other Canadians, are concerned about the economic recovery, health care and the H1N1 vaccine rollout ... and maybe climate change on a slow news day. They might even be somewhat concerned about the country's reputation being harmed by allegations that Canadians handed over prisoners to be tortured in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>What Quebecers are decidedly not concerned about, at the end of the first decade of the new century, is the language issue that dominated provincial public-policy debates for decades at the end of the previous century.</p>
<p>We've been in this conversation since 1974, when Robert Bourassa, in his first incarnation as premier, enacted Bill 22, declaring French to be Quebec's official language. Then Rene Levesque adopted Bill 101, the Charter of the French Language, requiring allophone children (i. e. children whose first language is neither English nor French) to attend French primary and secondary school, as well as francization of the work place, and making French as the language of outdoor signs. When the Supreme Court overturned the sign law in 1988, Bourassa invoked the notwithstanding clause of the Charter of Rights to override it, only to relent as he was leaving office.</p>
<p>Since then, we've enjoyed 15 years of peace on the language front, with only the occasional outbursts from the purs et durs, the language and sovereignty hardliners of the Parti Quebecois.</p>
<p>Previous PQ leaders, notably Lucien Bouchard in government and Andre Boisclair in opposition, were more than prepared to let sleeping dogs lie. They wanted to put their leadership on the line in support of a moderate society, open to the world.</p>
<p>Not Pauline Marois, the current PQ leader. At a national council meeting last weekend, she not only permitted debate on two potentially explosive issues of language in education, she sparked it.</p>
<p>And so the PQ seriously discussed two bad ideas -- one old and one new, that could destroy Quebec's hard-won peace, or least truce, on the language issue.</p>
<p>The old bad idea has been kicking around for years, and has been advocated by the likes of former PQ leader Bernard Landry. It would force francophone and allophone students to attend CEGEPs (the province's post-secondary network of junior colleges) in French. So while students would be old enough to vote by second year CEGEP, they wouldn't be old enough to choose whether to attend college in French or English.</p>
<p>The PQ language hawks are once again advocating this position because a reported 40% of allophone high school graduates and, wait for it, 4% of francophone graduates, are doing their CEGEP in English at outstanding schools such as Dawson College in downtown Montreal and John Abbott on the West Island.</p>
<p>If the policy is adopted by a PQ policy convention in 2011 (and assuming the PQ actually wins the next election), students would no longer have the option of attending CEGEP in English of French. It would be a bad idea whose time had finally come.</p>
<p>The new bad idea is to force francophone and allophone infants and toddlers into French daycares, and it's Marois herself who gave it impetus going into last week's general council session, declaring that French was endangered in Montreal, and that some "electroshocks" were needed: "We should go in the direction of applying Bill 101 in child care centres."</p>
<p>Quebec, with only 20% of day-care-age kids in the country, has 50% of the daycare space in Canada, because of a heavily subsidized program that costs parents only $7 a day (out of the real costs of $50 a day).</p>
<p>Daycare is an untouchable pillar of social policy and is considered a model for liberal policy-makers in the rest of Canada. For the PQ to propose turning daycares into language laboratories is indicative of a party returning to its militant roots in an attempt revive its slumbering, and shrinking, base.</p>
<p>But it's quite shocking coming from Marois, who is clearly desperate for traction on something, anything. In another life, she was Quebec's education minister -- one of the best, on a short list of outstanding ones along with Paul Gerin-Lajoie and Claude Ryan. How sad to see her now hawking such bad, divisive ideas.</p>

<p>Agency confirms 24 cases of anaphylaxis linked to vaccine</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada says there have been 24 cases of confirmed anaphylaxis in people who got an H1N1 flu shot in Canada. Agency head Dr. David Butler-Jones says that works out to a rate of 0.32 cases for every 100,000 doses of vaccine administered so far in Canada. He says one of the confirmed cases involved a person who died after receiving the vaccine. But he says that person had other health problems as well and it's not yet clear what caused his death.</p>

<p>A jury has returned guilty verdicts in the double-murder trial of Christopher Little. He was found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of his estranged wife, Julie Crocker, and another woman, Paula Menendez, in February 2007. The convictions carry an automatic life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years. The Crown had said the Markham, Ont., resident slashed the throat of Crocker, then killed Menendez and tried to make it look like she had killed Crocker before committing suicide.</p>

<p>Former cabinet minister being sued for leaving accident scene</p>
<p>A former Nova Scotia cabinet minister convicted in 2007 of leaving the scene of an accident is being sued for damages. George Myrer, who was one of two people in a car rear-ended by Ernie Fage in November 2006, filed his suit Monday. Myrer's lawyer, Barry Mason, said Wednesday that he is now in the process of gathering all the information documenting Myrer's injuries, but may be open to some type of settlement. Fage could not be reached for comment. Fage, who was a member of former premier Rodney MacDonald's cabinet, resigned as human resources minister soon after cellphone images of him driving away from the fender-bender were broadcast. He was fined $920 and lost his licence for two years, prompting his immediate expulsion from the Conservative caucus.</p>
<p>Toronto</p>
<p>Six Toyota SUVs stolen</p>
<p>from single neighbourhood</p>
<p>Police say thieves stole six Toyota Highlander SUVs in a Toronto neighbourhood overnight. Owners reported the vehicles were stolen from driveways around the Leaside neighbourhood (in the Bayview and Eglinton Avenues area). Investigators call the concentrated thefts of a single-style vehicle "highly unusual." Authorities say they are still trying to determine if an organized crime ring is behind the thefts. They are also trying to determine if the thieves used "proximity keys" to steal electric codes from lock systems - a new technology available on the Toyota Highlander. One man told CTV he still has both sets of keys to his stolen vehicle, and police advised him thieves can use a laptop computer to compromise the vehicle's keyless operational system.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Layoff notices going to 34 at Grand River Hospital</b>
</div><div>By Brent Davis   </div>
<div>Record staff</div>

<p>KITCHENER</p>
<p>Grand River Hospital expects to give layoff notices to 34 nursing and service staff as it shifts resources and contends with an $800,000 deficit.</p>
<p>Wednesday's announcement will affect nine registered nurses and 25 service staff belonging to CAW Local 1106. The changes are being made in conjunction with the gradual closure of a temporary unit at the Freeport site that primarily housed patients waiting for a nursing home bed.</p>
<p>It's expected that alternate nursing positions will be offered to all of the nurses, but it's not clear yet whether there are enough alternative positions left vacant from retirements and departures for all of the affected service staff.</p>
<p>Additional nurses will be added to the acute medicine program as the hospital prepares for the higher patient volumes typically seen in the winter months and exacerbated by the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>"There's no question that the health care system is under pressure because of these economic times," said Bryce Walker, chair of the hospital's board of directors.</p>
<p>Local 1106 president Bill McLachlan said the union was told of the plan Wednesday morning, and plans to discuss it with management.</p>
<p>"We may try to come up with a recommendation to minimize the damage to our members," he said.</p>
<p>A number of staff from the CAW's clerical bargaining unit will be redeployed into vacant positions, but there won't be any layoffs.</p>
<p>The hospital has experienced a steady reduction in the past year in the number of people waiting to be transferred to a nursing home. Those beds at Freeport will be reduced from about 110 to between 80 and 90, said communications director Mark Karjaluoto.</p>

</p>
<p>HAMILTON</p>
<p>For more than an hour, two men wearing surgical masks, hoods and carrying hidden handguns loitered around the main entrance of Hamilton General Hospital Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>They were there to spring prisoner Fawad Ahmed Nouri - in broad daylight and under guard at one of the busiest hospitals in the city.</p>
<p>The hospital's surveillance cameras catch the men's obscured images as they walk in and out of the front lobby waiting for Nouri to be escorted back to the jail guards' van.</p>
<p>The first man showed up shortly after 10 a.m. wearing a surgical mask and hoodie, the other moments later.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes earlier, 25-year-old Nouri had arrived at the General for a medical appointment in handcuffs, leg shackles and an orange jumpsuit. He was flanked by two unarmed Hamilton Wentworth Detention Centre correctional officers.</p>
<p>A surveillance camera inside the General's main doors shows a man walk inside wearing a green surgical mask and dark clothing, then he's seen "walking around, checking it out," said Det.- Sgt. Dave Beech, the officer in charge of a police hunt that now stretches across Canada.</p>
<p>More video captures the second man in a hooded sweatshirt with what appears to be lettering on the front.</p>
<p>Witnesses didn't think anything of the men's concealed faces given the H1N1 flu situation.</p>
<p>After the second accomplice showed up, police think both entered the hospital to scope it out and then returned outside where they sat down on a bench by the main doors and waited patiently.</p>
<p>At 11:23 a.m., Nouri appeared at the nearby admitting doors next to the emergency entrance, still in leg shackles and handcuffs, flanked by the two guards.</p>
<p>They walked a short distance to the white correctional services prisoner transfer van. They were right beside it when they were jumped. The two men ran up behind them. They pulled out handguns and ordered the guards down onto the ground. They demanded the van's keys, and the unarmed correctional officers complied. It all happened very fast.</p>
<p>Nouri jumped in the van's side door, the two others jumped in, too, and they took off at high speed. Obviously, police want to know how these men knew Nouri would be coming out of those admitting doors at the time, said Supt.Bill Stewart.</p>
<p>"It's certainly an area we're pursuing as to how he may have been able to alert his accomplices to the fact that he was going to the hospital," Stewart said.</p>
<p>Investigators have arranged to have Nouri included on the RCMP's most wanted fugitive list.</p>
<p>Police are also studying surveillance footage from Barton jail itself where an entrance security camera captured the image of stocky man with very short dark hair and a goatee wearing reflective sunglasses pushed up on the top of his head. Police say the man is a "person of interest" who showed up at the jail several hours before Nouri was helped to escape by the two men. They want to talk to him or identify him. Hamilton police have put the image on their website.</p>

</div><div>KAREN SEIDMAN   </div>

<p>The number of absences has finally started to decline at both West Island school boards, suggesting that the H1N1 virus has peaked - at least for now.</p>
<p>At the Lester B. Pearson School Board, the percentage of total school board absences was at its lowest level earlier this week - 5 per cent - since the board began keeping track of them in October. Of the total student population, only 0.8 per cent were reportedly absent due to flu-like symptoms, according to communications officer Daniela Scoppa.</p>
<p>Scoppa said that at its peak on Nov. 6, the overall absentee rate was 12.9 per cent, with 5.16 per cent of the student population reporting flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>At the Commission Scolaire Marguerite Bourgeoys, communications officer Brigitte Léonard said the absences this week were also a bit lower than last week. The percentage of total school board absences was 3.7 per cent early this week.</p>
<p>Both boards are plowing ahead with plans to bus students to vaccination centres for the H1N1 vaccine. So far, the operation has been going well, but the boards still have not received any assurances from the provincial government that costs incurred by the operation will be covered by the government.</p>
<p>The Pearson board started its off-island busing Monday with four schools. The on-island operation will begin next Monday.</p>
<p>About 400 to 500 students were bused (and vaccinated) on the first day.</p>
<p>The numbers were similar at Marguerite Bourgeoys, which also started busing students to vaccination centres on Monday. Of 2,250 students who were eligible for busing, about 580 students opted to go to the vaccination centre.</p>
<p>Léonard said schools will get notices about five days ahead of time when they are going to offer the service to students, so notes and permission slips can go out to parents. She said the operation should last about four weeks for the board.</p>
<p>Nan Beaton, chairperson of the Pearson's Central Parents Committee, said some parents are reluctant to take advantage of the service being offered by schools because they want to be with their children when they are vaccinated or they are concerned about side effects.</p>

</p>
<p>Human swine flu is hospitalizing three to four times as many children than regular seasonal influenza, new data from a nationwide surveillance system show.</p>
<p>Since October, 526 H1N1-related hospitalizations were reported by 12 pediatric teaching hospitals across Canada that represent almost 90 per cent of all tertiary care pediatric beds in the country.</p>
<p>During the week of Nov. 7 alone, 264 children were hospitalized - about half the total number of Canadian children hospitalized during last year's entire flu season, and three to four times as many flu-related admissions during any week since the network began collecting data five years ago.</p>
<p>"Children across Canada are being hospitalized in very large numbers for influenza this year, much larger than anything we've ever seen before," said Dr. Wendy Vaudry, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton and co-principal investigator of IMPACT, an immunization monitoring program administered by the Canadian Paediatric Society and funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>"It is causing significant illness in children all across Canada."</p>
<p>Vaudry, a mother of four, said vaccination is the best way to protect children against H1N1. "If I were a parent hearing this, I'd walk out this afternoon and go to your closest clinic and get your baby immunized," she said.</p>
<p>It is not yet known how many children admitted to hospital during the second wave have required intensive care. Normally, about 15 per cent of children admitted with flu end up in intensive care.</p>
<p>It is also not yet known how many of them had underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>Usually, the majority of flu admissions in children are in children under age 2. But older children are being hospitalized with H1N1.</p>
<p>"We're seeing more children in the 2 to 5, and 5 to 9 age groups than we usually do in a normal flu season," Vaudry said.</p>

<p>It's one thing to be critical of the provincial government's handling (or mishandling) of the H1N1 pandemic, but in laying direct blame for deaths, opposition leader David Swann has gone too far.</p>
<p>It's the virus that caused the deaths of 51 Albertans. To suggest the government is directly responsible because of its lack of action or incompetence is ludicrous.</p>
<p>Yet Swann and his Alberta Liberals have done just that, repeating the accusation in interviews with the media and in the legislature Monday, when they asserted the Stelmach government's immunization program was killing people.</p>
<p>"Those people who were supposed to be vaccinated, how many of them have died or are in hospital today because they failed to get the vaccine?" Swann asked.</p>
<p>He could equally question how many high-risk people lived, because someone close to them got vaccinated;someone who might otherwise have caught the flu and passed it on had the vaccination program not been open to everyone.</p>
<p>As a medical doctor and the leader of the Alberta Liberal Party, Swann should choose his words more carefully. There are far too many unknowns that have left even Canada's top public health officers grappling. In British Columbia, where the virus has peaked, citizens are still being told to get inoculated because experts have no idea whether flu activity will slow down or continue.</p>
<p>"What happens now?Who knows," said Michael Gardam, director of infectious diseases prevention and control in Ontario. "Is it going to stay elevated for many more weeks or is it going to come down quite quickly?We don't know." Certainly, Alberta's H1N1 death toll is troubling because it's nearly double the national average and well above those provinces with a population of more than one million.</p>
<p>This needs to be watched and answers provided to Albertans, as soon as possible. If Albertans were hit harder, at the end of the day, there needs to be inquiries into why, and whether a different response would have changed that outcome.</p>
<p>But to reach a conclusion now is premature and reckless.</p>
<p>What role has weather played in the outbreak? Alberta gets colder faster, and the change in temperature creates the perfect storm for flu season. What about demographics, and the fact that Alberta has a younger population?Or was H1N1 worse here because of the high rate of asthma sufferers?</p>
<p>Swann has the expertise to be contributing to some of these answers. Instead, he comes off as a political amateur by crossing a disturbing line. Is it any wonder so few people aspire to public service?Being criticized is one thing but to be accused of having blood on ones'hands is simply cruel. Swann's mean-spirited attack undermines all that he might have legitimately raised on this issue, as a public health expert and leader of the opposition.</p>

<p>Premier Gordon Campbell entered the legislature chamber one afternoon this week flanked by a small platoon of public servants. Two deputy ministers. His executive financial officer. His executive coordinator.</p>
<p>They in turn were armed with a stack of binders and files, plus four BlackBerrys that were often in play to retrieve additional information. The premier himself toted some intriguingly colourful documents, highlighted in yellow, with further annotations in red and blue ink, presumably for emphasis.</p>
<p>All this in anticipation of the annual debate on the budget for the office of the premier, an exercise that sees members of the Opposition (mostly leader Carole James) question Campbell's actions, decisions and priorities.</p>
<p>But despite all the resources at hand, Campbell was unable to provide reassuring answers on James's key line of questioning.</p>
<p>She spent the better part of three hours Tuesday afternoon probing a single topic: how the premier had learned during the election campaign about the province's deteriorating financial situation and chose not to tell the public.</p>
<p>Campbell tried to play down the former and excuse the latter. Some excerpts will give a flavour of the lengthy exchange.</p>
<p>He said he learned about the pressures on provincial revenues via "a conversation with my deputy in the days prior to the election," meaning his then-deputy Jessica McDonald, who has since left.</p>
<p>It was roughly May 7, though he said he couldn't remember exactly -- "Frankly, I'm not certain of the date" -- nor was the exchange noted in his official diary -- "Frankly, I don't record every telephone conversation."</p>
<p>As per the usual protocols regarding minimal contact between politicians and public servants during a campaign, he did not get regular briefings from McDonald. "If there was a requirement for the deputy to discuss with me, she was put through to wherever I was in the province at the time. ... I don't think it was a specifically organized meeting."</p>
<p>The main topic of conversation was mounting concerns about the H1N1 virus. Additionally, "I was informed there were revenue pressures. ... Candidly, it was a passing comment."</p>
<p>Still, despite the brevity, he did learn the extent of the pressures on provincial revenues. "I think the comment was made that they could be $200 million to $300 million. To put that into context, it was about 0.5 per cent (of total revenues)."</p>
<p>But to put that revelation into another context, this was about five weeks into the financial year. Already, revenues were off as much as $300 million. If the slide continued over the full 12 months, the pressures could be in the billions.</p>
<p>James: "Didn't the premier feel it was important for the public to hear that his $495-million deficit could be at risk?"</p>
<p>Campbell: "At that time, I didn't feel and the public service didn't feel it was at risk. Yes, there were revenue challenges. Yes, they could be met. They were manageable. ... That's what I knew."</p>
<p>Manageable, how? "We did not have a detailed discussion about the ways that the deputy minister felt that we could deal with this. ... The deputy did not articulate a series of savings. She said there were things that we could do to manage those costs and that was the extent of the conversation."</p>
<p>Did he talk to the finance minister about the implications of the revenue decline? "No." To other members of cabinet? "Not that I recall."</p>
<p>If he didn't talk it over, how could he be so sure the emerging revenue pressures were manageable? Because, Campbell said, the government had already identified targets for savings in the February budget.</p>
<p>"Travel, professional services, office and business expenses, advertising and publication savings and discretionary grants. That's five broad areas that probably in my head I thought about."</p>
<p>Probably, in his head, he thought about them. Why didn't he share those thoughts with the public? "I think throughout the campaign I pointed out that this was going to require some very difficult decisions."</p>
<p>I doubt many voters recall him campaigning with that degree of candour. I recall him sharing next to no specifics on cuts. Plus there was his insistence that the projected $495-million deficit was a "maximum." Dubious then, laughable now.</p>
<p>James: "The premier received information about falling revenues around May 7, as he recalls, and just to be clear, the premier didn't do anything with that information."</p>
<p>Campbell: "I didn't have a discussion with people about it. I didn't have a discussion with other members of the staff. I wasn't in a position where I could follow through. There are very limited discussions that take place between the public service and those of us who are running for office at the time of an election. I really don't have much more that I can try to do to elucidate this for the leader of the Opposition. I hope that's clear."</p>
<p>Oh, it's clear all right. Clear enough that his opponents will be asking, "What's he hiding from you this time?" should he choose to run for another term.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Nancy Kosik's etiquette classes have become more complicated.</p>
<p>The Montreal-based consultant offers workshops in etiquette and protocol for students, business executives and politicians, at home as well as in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Among the basics to be mastered is the handshake, the age-old ritual for meeting, greeting, parting, thanking and congratulating.</p>
<p>These days, fears of contracting the H1N1 influenza virus have many people squirming, recoiling, nodding and waving -- anything to avoid shaking hands.</p>
<p>Kosik said she understands their concerns. She makes hand-sanitizing dispensers available at all her classes. She keeps miniature bottles in her coat, her purse, in the car and at home.</p>
<p>Kosik said she lauds all the new-found attention being paid to hygiene. But it's bad manners to refuse an extended hand without offering an adequate excuse. And in most situations, a wave or a nod or a fistbump is not an adequate equivalent.</p>
<p>"In so many social and business situations, handshaking is extremely important. It's a way of showing respect, of saying it's a pleasure or an honour to meet you."</p>
<p>Refusing to shake hands, she said, might be construed as a sign of disinterest, insensitivity or discomfort.</p>
<p>Kosik's advice is to acknowledge the non-handshaking right off the bat. Say something like: "I'd love to shake hands, but I think I'm coming down with something. I don't want to put you at risk."</p>
<p>Or try this: "I see you're a little stuffed up and my immune system is a little weak. Sorry if I don't shake hands."</p>
<p>Say it even if it's a little white lie, she counselled. "In proper etiquette, you never make others feel uncomfortable."</p>
<p>But what if it's the boss or an important client and the handshake is unavoidable? Shake hands, then get out the hand sanitizer as soon as you're out of sight.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Regional home care gets $1.7M boost; Step toward balancing strapped agency's budget</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>686 words</div><div>26 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Eastern Ontario's health authority has approved a $1.7-million handout to the region's beleaguered home-care agency, a first step toward balancing its budget without sacrificing essential services for the frail, sick and dying.</p>
<p>"We are very relieved that we are receiving these funds," said Lynn Graham, chairwoman of the Champlain Community Care Access Centre (CCAC), which is in charge of the region's home-care program.</p>
<p>"We are going to continue to ... see if we can identify other strategies to mitigate the impact on our clients."</p>
<p>The CCAC has overspent its $180-million budget by $6.5 million barely halfway through its fiscal year, forcing it to stop taking new clients and cut in-home services such as nursing visits, personal support and physiotherapy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, dying patients desperate to leave hospital are being denied their wish to spend their final days in their own homes.</p>
<p>To minimize the impact of the cuts on the region's most vulnerable, the Champlain Local Health Integration Network (LHIN), which has authority over how provincial health dollars are spent in the region, agreed Wednesday to step in with a one-time grant.</p>
<p>LHIN chairwoman Marie Fortier made it clear the money was not a bailout. "Our goal was not to dispose of the deficit. Our goal was to do something right now about mitigating the impact of the reductions of service."</p>
<p>That leaves the CCAC $1 million short of what it needs to ensure that between now and March 31, when the fiscal year ends, the most vulnerable eastern Ontarians get the appropriate home-care services to remain independent and out of overburdened hospitals. The CCAC has identified 1,500 clients -- the dying, the disabled, hospital patients sent home early and seniors trying to remain in their homes -- who require priority access to home care over the next four months. Providing services to those clients would require an extra $2.7 million, according to the CCAC.</p>
<p>But the Champlain LHIN is cash-strapped, so $1.7 million was "the best we could come up with," said Fortier.</p>
<p>That means there will still be many stranded in hospital, waiting to be discharged to their own homes. "They will have to continue to wait," said Patrice Connolly, the CCAC's acting chief executive.</p>
<p>More than 300 people, including 24 patients in need of palliative care, are languishing in hospital beds awaiting the in-home supports that would allow them to be discharged.</p>
<p>The backlog causes cancelled surgeries, bed shortages and long emergency-room waits. In recent weeks, hospital overcrowding has resulted in some frail, elderly patients being parked in beds next to patients with H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The CCAC expects to end the fiscal year with a $5.4-million deficit, which represents about three per cent of its budget. The agency has signed an "accountability agreement" with the LHIN that forbids it from running a deficit; that agreement is expected to be amended to require the CCAC to balance its budget by the end of fiscal 2011, said Fortier.</p>
<p>In exchange for financial aid, the CCAC has agreed to provide the LHIN with monthly budget updates, and to continue to find ways to rein in costs.</p>
<p>The CCAC has already imposed a hiring freeze on vacant administrative positions and halted spending on consultants, which would save about $500,000. Connolly said no cuts are being planned to the agency's 600 case managers.</p>
<p>The CCAC also intends to use a larger number of less skilled, lower-paid personal support workers, who would take over work currently being done by nurses, said Connolly. "That's just the tip of the iceberg. There are other efficiencies that we are looking at."</p>
<p>Since 2007, when amalgamation in the home-care sector led to the creation of the Champlain CCAC, the agency has lurched from crisis to crisis. The agency has lost three top executives in two years, most recently with the departure of chief executive Sheila Bauer after only 18 months.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Here comes Sani-Claus; Malls taking measures to limit season sneezings</b>
</div><div>Tony Lofaro   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>610 words</div><div>26 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Parents planning to take the children to visit Santa Claus at the nearest mall can rest assured the visit will be as sanitary as possible.</p>
<p>Concern over the spread of H1N1 has made Ottawa mall managers vigilant. Before cozying up to jolly St. Nick, children are expected to extend their hands for shots of sanitizer.</p>
<p>Mall Santas are also being asked to change their white gloves often, dry-clean their uniforms regularly and not show up for work if they feel ill.</p>
<p>Mall managers say the measures are being enacted for the sake of everyone's health.</p>
<p>At St. Laurent Shopping Centre, management has hired extra staff. Members of the "Santa Squad" ask visitors to extend their hands for sanitizer before visiting Santa's headquarters.</p>
<p>"We haven't had one person say no. Parents have been thankful because we've made it easy for them to keep up a germ-free area for their children," said Bernice Rachkowski, marketing director at St. Laurent.</p>
<p>"It's the children who are the first to put their hand out and they know the routine. They rub their hands until the soap evaporates and they're like telling their parents how to do it," she said.</p>
<p>Rachkowski credits a general public awareness of the H1N1 virus, especially in the schools, for the acceptance of the new measures.</p>
<p>"I expected to see the hand sanitizers here, but I think it's a good idea," said Eric Gagnon, who brought his five-year-old son, Zachary, to see Santa Claus at St. Laurent on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>He said his son was accustomed to using hand sanitizers and usually asked for the pump bottles wherever they went, and that small disruption does not take away from the fun of visiting Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Even Santa Claus agreed his workshop was a much cleaner environment, thanks to the new measures.</p>
<p>"I think it's a good thing what they're doing and besides, I'm not getting as many colds (from the kids)," joked Santa Claus (a.k.a. David Daley).</p>
<p>Bayshore Shopping Centre general manager Denis Pelletier said it had enacted the same preventive measures as other area malls for the Santa Claus headquarters.</p>
<p>It's much the same at Carlingwood Shopping Centre, where the hand sanitizers next to Santa's station and throughout the mall are replenished daily, spokesman Barry Averill said.</p>
<p>"I think we have an obligation to ensure that they're full daily so parents have that sense of well-being when they enter the mall," Averill said.</p>
<p>He said the mall had three Santas rotating throughout the day. They are asked to use disinfectant to spray on their costumes before and after shifts, and they must change gloves frequently.</p>
<p>In addition, Santa's chair, handrails and Christmas decorations are wiped frequently, and the carpet in the booth is cleaned nightly, he said.</p>
<p>Averill said the measures might seem "excessive," but public safety is vital.</p>
<p>"It's trying to find that balance between being too excessive and taking the right responsibility to ensure that they enjoy a comfortable environment when they come in," he said.</p>
<p>"We're trying to keep the spirit of Christmas, but at the same time, make sure that everyone understands what's going on."</p>

<p>The Citizen often uses closeups of small children crying and wincing before and during their vaccinations. Large photographs of the needles are used, too. Maybe the Citizen could use different photographs to depict H1N1 news. It may prevent people, especially children, from enduring hours or days of unnecessary apprehension.</p>
<p>As a child, I dreaded getting vaccinations. At some point in my life, I realized that the fear of the needle was worse than the needle itself. So now I don't think about it and I don't look because I know if I focus too much on it, it will bother me more.</p>
<p>When I got my H1N1 vaccination Monday by my family doctor, I did not realize it was finished until my doctor said so. I have passed this realization on to my children who don't worry so much anymore either.</p>

<p>The H1N1 flu vaccine will be available to the general public in the Outaouais starting Monday, a week after the vaccine was offered to all Ottawa residents.</p>
<p>Céline Jacob, a spokeswoman for the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de l'Outaouais, said health officials wanted to vaccinate as many students and people over 65 as possible before offering the vaccine to the general public.</p>
<p>Jacob said public health officials had vaccinated 26.5 per cent of the Outaouais population. Pregnant women, children under five years old, health care workers and people with chronic health problems were the first people vaccinated followed by students and people 65 and over.</p>
<p>As lineups decreased and more vaccine became available, the Ministry of Health decided to open its H1NI flu vaccine campaign to the general public in some parts of Quebec starting Wednesday.</p>
<p>Montreal, the Eastern Townships, Quebec City, the North Shore, Chaudière-Appalaches, Laval and the Montérégie areas will gradually be accepting anyone who wants to be immunized, Health Minister Yves Bolduc said Tuesday. Vaccination clinics in other regions of Quebec are to open to the general public starting Monday.</p>
<p>Ottawa Effort Continues</p>
<p>The City of Ottawa is continuing with its H1N1-shot clinics today at the Orléans client-service centre on Centrum Boulevard, Vanier-Richelieu Community Centre, Tom Brown Arena, Public Health headquarters at 100 Constellation Cres. in Centrepointe, Kanata Recreation Complex, Barrhaven Crossing Mall and Fred Barrett Arena.</p>
<p>There's also a one-day clinic today at Alfred Taylor Community Centre, 2300 Community Way in North Gower.</p>
<p>At all those locations, the city starts distributing wristbands to reserve places in line at 9 a.m. and begins giving shots at 2:30 p.m., except at Public Health headquarters, where shots begin at 5 p.m.</p>

</p>
<p>Harmonized tax deserves support,</p>
<p>Editorial Nov. 17</p>
<p>I don't know what cracked crystal ball economist Jack Mintz was gazing into when he made his rosy economic prediction that 591,000 jobs will be created over the next 10 years with the HST tax reform bill, but we have been cutting corporate taxes for 20 years and manufacturing jobs are still leaving the country and the nation's debt keeps rising at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>The HST is an unfair tax because it taxes the poor at the same rate as the rich. My husband is a small businessman who employs five people. He doesn't make enough to incorporate so he won't be getting that 4 per cent corporate tax cut. And the tax rebate won't help him.</p>
<p>It's a shell game - the feds give us some money with one hand and take it back with the other. We need progressive tax reform that doesn't favour a few wealthy people at the top at the expense of the rest of us - before the global debt we've accumulated consumes us all.</p>
<p>Cathy Allen, Peterborough</p>
<p>I have read with interest the oft-repeated position of the Star in lauding the business benefits of the HST. Thus, I have been waiting for weeks to read in my favourite daily about Torstar's protest to the government at being unfairly deprived of those benefits, by having its product exempted from the tax.</p>
<p>Better yet, perhaps you will renounce the exemption, insist on being subject to the HST and thereby gain an enormous advantage over your less savvy competitors.</p>
<p>A.L. Pasman, Grand Valley</p>
<p>Will the H1N1 vaccine ward off this HST I keep hearing about?</p>

<p>Hunt widens for inmate</p>
<p>The medical masks worn by two loitering men who helped spring a prisoner visiting a Hamilton hospital didn't raise suspicions because of the H1N1 outbreak, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Hamilton police released surveillance images of the armed, mask-clad suspects Wednesday, a day after guards escorting Fawad Ahmed Nouri, 25, were overpowered and Nouri was whisked away. The search for Nouri went nationwide Wednesday, with Toronto police on alert because he used to live in the city.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Painter raided museums for her latest show</b>
</div><div>Murray Whyte   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>883 words</div><div>26 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>E07</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>On Thursday, Joanne Tod opens "Kingdom Come," a show of new paintings that comes loaded - pardon the pun - with critical intent for the sometimes-sticky realm of museum culture. Loaded because the show's title work is a gilded Colt .45 revolver, a showpiece of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and as lovely an implement of death as you'll find. Tod, one of Canada's best-known painters, transforms it, and other artifacts she photographed at museums around the world, into a study of provenance, value and the institutions themselves. It's a departure from her most recent work, an ongoing project to paint the portrait of every Canadian solder who has died in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Q: Your most recent work, with the portraits of the Canadian soldiers, is very visceral; institutions seem a very stuffy and clinical subject by comparison.</p>
<p>A: I wouldn't disagree, but I would say things have changed. Most museums now have a very liberal photography policy, and with the fact that digital cameras are everywhere, and the quality is excellent, it makes them far more approachable and user-friendly.</p>
<p>Q: What do these institutions think of what you're doing?</p>
<p>A: We'll see (laughs). The jury's out. But really, there are all sorts of questions about how these things got here (to the museums). And in some cases, it's flagrantly evident that it's something that was looted.</p>
<p>Q: I guess that explains the context of the piece Stolen Antiquities, Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p>A: (Laughs). That was the installation of the Greek and Roman artifacts (in New York's Metropolitan Museum). In fact, probably those ones are acceptable, in terms of how they were acquired. But who knows? Even just the fact that there are so many Greek artifacts in so many museums outside of Greece - it makes you think, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Q: Which brings us to another painting, of ornate ceramic vases in a vitrine, called Tabula Rasa.</p>
<p>A: Well, exactly. This was in the newly refurbished ROM's collection. Obviously, the text has been removed from the panel below the object, but it's also an architectural term that refers to the space where an old building was razed to make way for a new one - kind of like the ROM itself.</p>
<p>Q: You don't sound like you love the outcome.</p>
<p>A: Well, 20 years from now, do you want to make a bet? It won't be there. It's basically a bunch of unusable, eccentric spaces that don't serve any purpose at all. It's such a shame.</p>
<p>Q: The undertone of all this work seems to suggest collecting, hoarding, a desire to possess things that are deemed by some authority to be valuable. Being an artist who is collected yourself, by museums as well as individuals, all sorts of things turn back on themselves.</p>
<p>A: Sure. In a sense, I'm making another artifact, and even with all the cynicism inherent in what I'm depicting, and what I call them, I'm still complicit in the system. And the art world is a ravenous place for consuming things. But it's true: I make a living from this, so I must participate. I'm standing behind my product (laughs).</p>
<p>Q: That's kind of what institutions do, don't they - build cultural reverence for objects that are, in the end, high-priced luxury goods? Museums promote this romantic notion of the creative process, but the fact they exist at all suggests a market value system - something not very romantic, and very real, about the world of art.</p>
<p>A: Oh, definitely. It's like the industrial farm; people who eat meat like to think of a cow grazing in a sunny pasture, but in reality, it's probably cramped in and can't even walk. People have this romantic idea of the artist in the studio, but really, there's a lot of anxiety. It can be a sublime activity, but not always.</p>
<p>Q: You also have a small selection of portraits in the show; one of Edgar Hernandez, the boy in Texas who's believed to be swine flu's patient zero; a diptych of Omar Khadr and Maher Arar; and a four-part piece with Barack and Michelle Obama, Michaelle Jean and Oprah Winfrey. Can you make the connection for me?</p>
<p>A: Well, like objects in a museum, these are very conspicuous specimens. They really portray the museum system: Politics, the entertainment industry, war, disease.</p>
<p>Q: But fun to paint, I bet.</p>
<p>A: Well, Church and State (the Obamas, Jean, Winfrey) - it's no coincidence that these are all youngish, dynamic black people. This is momentous - it's never occurred in history before. (Laughs.) And they all have great teeth.</p>
<p>Q: I'm reading it as a suggestion that Oprah's the next president.</p>
<p>A: Oh, I think so. Don't you?WHAT: 'Kingdom Come' by Joanne Tod</p>
<p>WHEN: Nov. 26 to Dec. 22</p>
<p>WHERE: Nicholas Metivier Gallery, 451 King St. W.</p>

<p>Anaphylaxis after flu shot found in 24 Canadians</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada says there have been 24 cases of confirmed anaphylaxis in people who got an H1N1 flu shot in Canada.</p>
<p>Agency head Dr. David Butler-Jones says that works out to a rate of 0.32 cases for every 100,000 doses of vaccine administered so far in Canada.</p>
<p>Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can cause a person's airways to close up, and must be treated quickly with adrenalin, which is available at flu clinics.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones says one of the confirmed cases involved a person who died after receiving the vaccine.</p>
<p>He says that person, who has been described in news reports as a Quebec man in his 80s, had other health problems as well, and it has not been determined what caused his death.</p>
<p>Experts say all vaccines can induce anaphylaxis, but typically do so at very low rates.</p>
<p>Manitoba nursing homes need better inspections</p>
<p>Manitoba's auditor general says too many nursing homes aren't meeting basic provincial standards.</p>
<p>Carol Bellringer says an audit of the province's 126 nursing homes found more than half failed to meet four of five core standards.</p>
<p>Those standards include the use of restraints, pharmacy services, patient care plans, safety and staff education.</p>
<p>Bellringer says the province also needs to do a better job of inspecting nursing homes.</p>
<p>She says the province doesn't always review nursing homes before they are issued operating licences to ensure they can meet basic standards. She says inspections should be unannounced and there should be more followup visits to see if conditions have improved.</p>
<p>Meditation's benefits found in five-year study</p>
<p>Could the mental relaxation produced by transcendental meditation have physiological benefits?</p>
<p>A study presented recently at an American Heart Association meeting suggests that it may, at least in the case of people with established coronary artery disease.</p>
<p>Researchers followed about 200 high-risk patients for an average of five years. Among the 100 who meditated, there were 20 heart attacks, strokes and deaths; in the comparison group, there were 32. The meditators tended to remain disease-free longer and also reduced their systolic blood pressure.</p>

<p>A third shipment of vital medical equipment will be leaving Canada this weekend destined for the Ukraine as the country attempts to cope with the ravages of swine flu. Bob Onyschuk, chairman of Canada Ukraine Foundation , said, "This is a 'person to person, people of Canada to people of Ukraine' response to a major human tragedy. The shipments are going to specific hospitals in Western Ukraine who are still caught in a post-Soviet health-care system that is not equipped and cannot respond adequately to a crisis like this." Earlier this month, $180,000-worth of surgical masks, respirators and other supplies were shipped to Ukraine and this weekend a third shipment worth $100,000 will be flown over.

<p>Human swine flu is hospitalizing three to four times as many children than regular seasonal influenza, new data from a nationwide surveillance system shows.</p>
<p>Since October, 526 H1N1-related hospitalizations were reported by 12 pediatric teaching hospitals across Canada that together represent almost 90 per cent of all tertiary care pediatric beds in the country.</p>
<p>During the week of Nov. 7 alone, 264 children were hospitalized -- about half the total number of Canadian children hospitalized during last year's entire flu season, and three to four times as many flu-related admissions during any week since the network began collecting data five years ago.</p>
<p>"Children across Canada are being hospitalized in very large numbers for influenza this year, much larger than anything we've ever seen before," says Dr. Wendy Vaudry, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.</p>
<p>"It is causing significant illness in children all across Canada."</p>
<p>Vaudry, a mother of four, said vaccination is the best way to protect children against H1N1. "If I were a parent hearing this, I'd walk out this afternoon and go to your closest clinic and get your baby immunized," she said.</p>
<p>It is not yet known how many children admitted to hospital during the second wave have required intensive care.</p>
<p>Normally, about 15 per cent of children admitted with flu end up in intensive care. It is also not yet known how many of them had underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>Federal officials said yesterday that while the number of H1N1 cases is "levelling off" in some parts of the country, the peak of the second wave has not yet been reached. And they warned Canadians about becoming complacent.</p>
<p>Fewer positive flu tests and fewer outbreaks in schools were reported by the provinces and territories in the past week, two key indicators used to monitor the pandemic.</p>
<p>But the numbers remain well above normal for this time of year. In the last few weeks, for example, the rate of people who sought medical attention for flu symptoms was up to seven times higher than usual.</p>
<p>"In reaching the plateau of the second wave in some communities, it does not mean the pandemic is over," Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said yesterday.</p>
<p>"There is still the other side of the peak and there remain millions of infections to be prevented."</p>
<p>B.C. entered its second wave of the pandemic sooner than other provinces and, while it is still reporting a high number of hospitalizations, it was lower in the past week than in the previous week.</p>
<p>About 15 million doses of H1N1 vaccine will have been shipped to the provinces by the end of this week. As of Tuesday, 279 deaths linked to the H1N1 virus had been reported.</p>

<p>According to the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region (RQHR) more people are lining up to get their H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>On Tuesday -- the first day that the H1N1 vaccination became available to the general public -- about 2,000 people got their shots at the clinic located at the former Robert Usher Collegiate.</p>
<p>However, by approximately 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday that same clinic had injected about 1,500 people with the H1N1 vaccine, said Mark Torjusen, RQHR spokesman.</p>
<p>"The expectation was that we certainly would see 1,500 more (Wednesday) afternoon being that we are open longer in the afternoon than we are in the morning," said Torjusen. "The expectation for the Green and White room (at Mosaic Stadium) was probably about 1,000 based on the volume of people coming through."</p>
<p>He said the average wait length from start to finish was about an hour and a half at the Robert Usher clinic. He added the process would take more than five minutes because of the effort involved.</p>
<p>"It's going to take time get through because you have to go through registration, there's the information video that people sit through just to give them a sense of what this is all about," he said, adding, "The actual vaccination takes very little time. Then there's the 15 minutes of wait afterwards just to ensure there are no adverse reactions."</p>
<p>He said the Robert Usher clinic will be open daily until Saturday but the Green and White room clinic was open only on Wednesday. Both clinics will resume operation on Monday.</p>

</p>
<p>With the provincial government poised to limit distribution of clean needles to intravenous drug users, a Regina group is looking to inject some more facts into the debate.</p>
<p>"The politics around needle exchange are quite hot. But the science behind it is not very controversial. There's a lot of good research backing up the success of needle exchanges," said Shawn Fraser, executive director of Carmichael Outreach Centre. Among its many programs geared to the underprivileged, Carmichael donates space for a needle exchange program delivered by the health region.</p>
<p>Tonight, beginning at 6:30 p.m., Carmichael is opening its doors at 1925 Osler St. for tours followed by a discussion titled "The Truths about Needle Exchange Programs."</p>
<p>Scheduled speakers are University of Regina professors Marc Spooner, from the faculty of education, Garson Hunter, from the faculty of social work, and a spokesperson with the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users, who will appear via an Internet-based phone service.</p>
<p>The government announced in last month's throne speech that it would introduce changes to "limit the proliferation of needles" handed out by needle exchanges. The government hasn't yet made clear what those changes will entail.</p>
<p>That's because the Health Ministry is still gathering information, Health Minister Don McMorris said Wednesday. While a provincially commissioned study on needle exchange was released in February, McMorris said there's still more to learn about who uses the exchanges, how many get needles for others or take them to communities that don't have the program.</p>
<p>"I will say that we were kind of hoping to have more work done on this than what we have done, but it's partly because a lot of our public health people that would be helping us on this are tied up with H1N1," he added.</p>
<p>McMorris, who has been invited to the forum, said someone from his office and the ministry plan to attend.</p>
<p>Since the throne speech, a "Saskatchewan Needle Exchange Services Support Group" has formed on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and now Carmichael is hoping to spur further discussion.</p>
<p>Fraser said the proposed change took Carmichael by surprise, especially given the government's study that confirmed needle exchanges help reduce the spread of HIV and Hepatitis C.</p>
<p>"I just hate to see politics get involved with something that so directly affects so many people's lives," he added.</p>
<p>The review was sparked by concerns about discarded needles littering the ground during spring thaw. About 3.9 million needles were distributed in the last fiscal year. Saskatchewan programs overall have a 90 per cent return rate on needles. In Regina, which has four exchange sites, the rate is 94 per cent. The report also noted that since needles can be purchased in bulk at stores, many of the discarded needles in the community likely don't come from exchange programs. However, the report did suggest there could be improvement in areas like clean-up, accountability and disposal.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan has an estimated 5,000 inject users. With most Saskatchewan users favouring cocaine and morphine, an average user can go through 1,000 needles per year.</p>

<p>It's not surprising that strains of drug-resistant pandemic H1N1 flu are starting to turn up. That was always a possibility. Both over-use and under-use of antiviral drugs could be dangerous, so Canada's doctors have a narrow path to walk in the coming months.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that, as the H1N1 flu scare spread around the world this year, some doctors and institutions were handing out antivirals such as Tamiflu to healthy people, or to people with no risk factors and mild symptoms, as a way to stop or prevent outbreaks. As with many drugs, mis-use or over-use of Tamiflu increases the likelihood that the virus it attacks will develop a resistance to it.</p>
<p>And, as with any overused medical technology, patients get the blame. Desperate parents are blamed for asking for antibiotics for children who simply have colds. If the rate of caesarean sections is on the rise, well, some argue it must be because today's women just don't want to bother with labour. No doubt there are some pushy patients out there, but doctors have the ultimate responsibility for the drugs they prescribe and the procedures they perform.</p>
<p>Antibiotics and C-sections do save lives and shouldn't be avoided in necessary cases. The same is true of antivirals.</p>
<p>Now that some resistant H1N1 cases have been documented, there's a danger the pendulum could swing too far on the side of under-use. Some of the most frightening cases of H1N1 happened because patients weren't given antivirals soon enough.</p>
<p>So anyone in a high-risk group who develops flu symptoms, or whose illness takes a turn for the worse, should be on the drugs, even before tests confirm the diagnosis, and without squeamishness about drug resistance getting in the way of what could be a life-saving decision.</p>
<p>Antivirals are most effective when they're used right after the symptoms appear. That doesn't mean, contrary to a popular misunderstanding, that antivirals can't be used after 48 hours. As of mid-November, the World Health Organization's guidelines say that antivirals can be used at any stage as long as the flu is still active in the patient.</p>
<p>The casebooks of modern medical science are full of examples of drug resistance, from tuberculosis treatment in Africa to antibiotics in the Canadian suburbs.</p>
<p>The basic lesson is clear, and applies to antiviral treatment of the flu as well: Proceed with caution.</p>

</p>
<p>The Greater Saskatoon Catholic school board was told this week the current wave of H1N1 illnesses peaked in Saskatoon schools during the first week of November.</p>
<p>A daily count of student absences in Catholic schools shows somewhere around 400 kids were calling in sick daily between mid-September and late October. But on Oct. 23, that number jumped to about 650 sick kids.</p>
<p>The number bounced between 600 and 800 absences until Nov. 2, when more than 1,300 kids stayed home sick from division schools. Absences remained above 1,200 kids daily for about a week, peaking on Nov. 5 at around 1,370 sick absences.</p>
<p>Since then, student absences dropped steadily, falling to slightly more than 200 kids gone on Nov. 19.</p>
<p>Similarly, school staff sick days also began growing Oct. 23. Earlier in the year, about 100 to 120 staff were calling in sick daily. On Oct. 24, that number rose above 140 and stayed above 120 sick staff each day, almost every day, until Nov. 18. Staff illness seemed to peak on Nov. 2, with about 175 employees off sick.</p>
<p>Superintendent Al Boutin said by the end of this week, the health region's H1N1 vaccination clinics at Catholic schools should be wrapping up. At some schools, vaccination rates were as low as 50 per cent and at others, as high as 90 per cent, he said.</p>
<p>When trustee Jim Carriere asked why there was such variation among schools, Boutin said the school division was careful not to say whether the immunization was "a good thing or a bad thing," because it isn't the division's place.</p>
<p>It just told parents and students the shot was available, Boutin said.</p>
<p>Trustee Ron Boechler said he was concerned about the school staff illness rates and wondered why teachers and other division employees were not vaccinated at the same time as students.</p>
<p>"We did advocate for that," Boutin said. However, given initial shortages of the H1N1 vaccine, the provincial government decided who should be vaccinated first, Boutin said.</p>
<p>Kids in kindergarten to Grade 6 were first on that priority list, then later, teenagers. Vaccination of the general public began in Saskatoon on Wednesday.</p>

</p>
<p>Doors opened to the general public Wednesday afternoon for the first time in the Saskatoon Health Region's H1N1 influenza vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>About 400 people queued inside Prairieland Park as they waited for the vaccinations to start at 1 p.m. Toward the end of the first hour, people leaving after their vaccine shot said waits ranged from 45 minutes to one hour.</p>
<p>The health region expects to vaccinate thousands of people each day until demand tapers off sometime in mid-December.</p>
<p>As Grey Cup parties and Christmas festivities are held in the coming weeks, the health region is urging people to get immunized.</p>
<p>"The behaviour of the H1N1 virus is quite unpredictable and being in closed social situations gives more opportunity for exposure to the virus," said Dr. Johnmark Opondo, deputy medical health officer for the health region, at a press conference at Prairieland.</p>
<p>The health region staffed Prairieland with 20 nurses on Wednesday with plans to vaccinate up to 3,000 people, said manager of disease control Karen Grauer.</p>
<p>Inside Prairieland, the health-care workers ran a veritable vaccination assembly line -- someone would fill a seat beside a nurse as soon as it was vacated.</p>
<p>"(Each nurse) can immunize about 17 people an hour, so we can put through about 400 people in an hour," Grauer said. The clinic runs from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. during the week and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends.</p>
<p>Ken Coons arrived at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday and found himself a few spots from the front of the line. He'd heard about lineups for previous groups -- children and at-risk people -- waiting for vaccinations.</p>
<p>"I expected the line so I thought I'd get here a little early," said Coons. "I'm going to the hospital next week so I thought I should get the shot. I'm going to Mexico, too, and that's where it started so better safe than sorry."</p>
<p>While some people are still debating whether to get vaccinated, the health region urges everyone to get immunized.</p>
<p>"We still have very ill people in intensive-care units," said Grauer. "If we become complacent and don't immunize, we could see a resurgence in overall cases. The longer we wait, the longer people are at risk."</p>
<p>More than 64,000 people have been vaccinated by Saskatoon Health Region staff, accounting for about 21.4 per cent of the population. Seven patients with H1N1 are in intensive-care units as of Wednesday.</p>
<p>The health region would like to see somewhere between 80 and 90 per cent of people vaccinated, but even 60 per cent "would be incredible," said health region deputy medical health officer Dr. Ross Findlater.</p>
<p>"Children under 10 are already in the 60 per cent range," he said.</p>
<p>Children six months to three years, and kids aged three to nine with chronic health problems only, should return to a clinic starting the week of Dec. 7 for a second dose of the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>The barrage of H1N1 media coverage and health region public information campaigns convinced Laurie Hiebert to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Her three kids had already been through the vaccination process so she expected a long wait and arrived an hour before the doors opened at Prairieland Park.</p>
<p>"The media is telling us we should (get vaccinated) and I have three kids at home," said Hiebert. "They're telling us it's a good idea to get the shot and there's been nothing pointing to any negative issues."</p>
<p>People with mild flu symptoms -- including fever, chills, headaches, cough, sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose -- should stay home, rest and drink lots of fluids.</p>
<p>Adults with severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing, sudden dizziness, chest pain, severe or persistent vomiting or diarrhea should visit an ER, as should children with symptoms such as fast breathing, grey skin colour, blue lips, dehydration and listlessness.</p>
<p>People at risk for seasonal influenza can also come to the Prairieland site to get the seasonal flu shot. People can get both shots at once if they want.</p>

<p>Hotel-Dieu Grace Hospital released its updated influenza pandemic plan Wednesday.</p>
<p>The document outlines practical and ethical priorities to control a flu pandemic and treat its victims. Chief of staff Art Kidd said the plan could change as the need arises. "It's a living document. It's always being refined by the newest recommendations of authorities."</p>
<p>The plan outlines strategies for doling out H1N1 immunizations. Included on the priority list are people under 65 with chronic conditions, pregnant women, healthy children aged six months to five years, people who live in remote and isolated settings, health care workers and people who provide care or are in household contact with those at high risk who cannot be immunized or do not respond to vaccines.</p>
<p>Kidd said he expects the H1N1 outbreak to continue, and said the hospital will likely reopen its special clinics if the need arises.</p>
<p>Hotel-Dieu opened an outpatient clinic for flu patients from Nov. 5 to Nov. 13 to alleviate the pressure on the hospital's emergency department.</p>
<p>"The natural history of something like this is it can come in waves and ebbs and tides," Kidd said. "One of the things we were very happy about was when we saw this rise, we were able to get these clinics going within just a few days. And we know that if there should be a sudden surge, we will be able to get them going within 24, 48 hours without any trouble at all."</p>
<p>The clinics were also intended to control the spread of the virus among non-flu patients, Kidd said.</p>
<p>"We learned from SARS that it was patients coming into the emergency room that actually spread it through the community. So the idea was to segregate those patients for their protection and for the protection of the public."</p>

<p>Health officials warned Wednesday that the second wave of H1N1 has not yet reached its peak despite cases in some areas "levelling off."</p>
<p>In the past week, there were fewer positive flu tests and fewer outbreaks reported in schools but the number of cases was still above normal for this time of year. The decrease in cases could be temporary and they can increase again, said Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>• In fact, according to nationwide statistics compiled since October, there has been 526 H1N1-related hospitalizations at 12 pediatric teaching hospitals across Canada. During the week of Nov. 7 alone, 264 children were hospitalized -- about half the total number of Canadian children hospitalized during last year's entire flu season, and three to four times as many flu-related admissions during any week since the network began collecting data five years ago.</p>
<p>• To date, there have been 279 H1N1-related deaths across the country. Ontario is leading with the highest number of deaths at 79, while Quebec is second with 78.</p>

<p>How bad is it out there for law firm slavies?</p>
<p>We will never know for sure in Canada because law firms jealously guard their employment and financial data. Thankfully, U.S. firms are more transparent.</p>
<p>When the National Law Journal did a head count south of the border, it found, well, that there were fewer heads to count. At the United States' 250 biggest firms, the number of lawyers fell 4 per cent to 126,669 this year – the biggest drop since the journal began tracking employment in 1978.</p>
<p>Hardest hit were associates, who saw their ranks thin by nearly 9 per cent to 61,733.</p>
<p>Laying down the law</p>
<p>on H1N1 sick leave</p>
<p>According to an internal communication obtained by Bar Talk, <span class="companylink">Bennett Jones LLP</span> has laid down some tough H1N1 laws for its employees.</p>
<p>Contrary to urgings from the medical community for employers to avoid bothering doctors with requests for sick notes, the document says that a “doctor's note may be required for absences related to pandemic influenza.”</p>
<p>Typically, employees of the firm – which has more than 350 staff in offices in Toronto, Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton – are allowed six days of sick leave annually. Any sick leave beyond that is allowed for up to five days, but pay on those extra days would be docked by 40 per cent. Additional days after that must come out of vacation time or occur without pay.</p>
<p>On the move</p>
<p>Miller Thomson LLP has added 11 lawyers to its business law group in Toronto in the past 10 months. Its most recent hire is Bob Forbes, a veteran corporate lawyer who is moving over from <span class="companylink">McCarthy Tétrault LLP</span>.</p>

<p>CORRECTION</p>
<p>Monday, November 30, 2009</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Bennett Jones LLP</span> staff are allowed 10 paid days of sick leave annually. Because of the flu pandemic, <span class="companylink">Bennett Jones</span> is providing up to five additional days, but pay on those extra days would be at the rate of 60 per cent of salary or staff may opt to use their 2009 vacation days. The days may be taken if the staff member is sick or wants to be at home for a family member affected by the H1N1 virus. Additional days after that must come out of vacation time or occur without pay. Although the firm reserves the right to require a doctor's note after an absence, it has not, to date, requested that any employee making use of these additional sick leave days provide such a note. Incorrect information appeared in the Nov. 25 Bar Talk.</p>

<p>Influenza A is a tricky virus that adapts quickly and can jump to different species. The H1N1 strain circulating now has been evolving for decades to spread fast and far around the world.</p>
<p>"Viruses that jump the species barrier are a worry," said Christine Dupont, a University of Waterloo biology lecturer with expertise in virology.</p>
<p>Viruses that can infect different species, unlike the regular seasonal influenza, have a better chance of changing into something new and more dangerous.</p>
<p>"There is a risk that a deadlier virus will emerge," said Dupont at a public lecture on the science of H1N1 at the Waterloo campus Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>The first wave of the Spanish influenza in 1918 was mild, she said. But the virus went on to kill 50 million people around the world in less than a year.</p>
<p>Dupont explained a virus is basically genetic material in protein shell. Two particular proteins allow a virus to dock onto a host cell and trick it into making more copies of the virus which are then released and an infection begins.</p>
<p>Hemagglutinin is an attachment protein that enables binding and entry into a host cell. Neuraminidase facilitates new virus cells to leave the host cell. There are 16 kinds of hemagglutinin and nine neuraminidase, and an influenza A virus is named depending on which one of those proteins are active, such as H1N1.</p>
<p>Virus strains live in species long enough to diversify so that they're no longer the same, which means human H1N1 is different from avian or swine H1N1.</p>
<p>"There is a species barrier because of the adaptation of these viruses," Dupont said.</p>
<p>But, there are two ways a virus can get past that barrier. The first way is mutations that allow a virus to bind to different receptors, which happened with H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The second way to move from animals to humans is when a hybrid virus is created by having two virus strains infect cells, and the replication of both creates a random new package.</p>
<p>A pandemic was sparked when a new virus spread to humans. A pandemic occurs when an infectious agent enters a population with no previous immunity and spreads over a large portion of the globe, Dupont explained. A pandemic does not mean a specific level of mortality of severity of illness. It can be mild, as is the case with H1N1 now. So far, H1N1 has killed about 7,000 people worldwide.</p>
<p>Dupont also addressed the controversy around two components of the H1N1 vaccine - the adjuvant squalene and the preservative thimerosal. But she warned the large audience to be wary about information circulating, in particular on the internet, about the danger of these additives.</p>
<p>She said squalene is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon made in livers, including in humans, and is safe in small doses. It is used to get out more vaccine during a pandemic because more doses can be made from a limited amount of vaccine.</p>
<p>The preservative thimerosal is a mercury containing organic compound used as an antibacterial agent for multi-dose vials - another essential when trying to immunize many people quickly. The mercury level in a vaccine is less than in a can of tuna, Dupont said.</p>
<p>Dr. William Ciccotelli, medical director of infectious diseases and medical microbiology at Grand River and St. Mary's hospitals, urged people to get the H1N1 vaccine. The risk of side-effects is very small, but the benefit to individuals and community is immense, especially for people who cannot be vaccinated or those immune compromised who may not respond to vaccines.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Armed pair free Hamilton inmate</b>
</div><div>By Susan Clairmont   </div>

<div>460 words</div><div>25 November 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>HAMILTON</p>
<p>In a daring daylight escape, a prisoner with a history of pointing guns at police broke free of jail guards with help from two waiting masked and armed accomplices, stole a police van and fled, sparking a massive search by police forces across southern Ontario.</p>
<p>Tuesday's escape was so well executed, police wonder how the prisoner knew ahead of time he was going to Hamilton General Hospital.</p>
<p>Those appointments are usually not discussed with inmates in advance.</p>
<p>"There's been some planning and execution in this escape," said police Supt. Bill Stewart.</p>
<p>"That information is not given to the inmates freely."</p>
<p>The escaped prisoner, Fawad Nouri, 25, was behind bars charged with robbing a Hamilton Tim Hortons in January, holding staff and customers hostage, getting into a high-speed chase with police and having a shootout with two officers.</p>
<p>The constables were not hurt, but Nouri was shot in the arm.</p>
<p>In October 2004, Nouri pleaded guilty to failing to stop, carrying a concealed weapon, possession of a prohibited weapon and two counts of robbery. Dressed in an orange prisoner jumpsuit, Nouri was taken to the Hamilton hospital Tuesday morning for a medical treatment, according to Stewart.</p>
<p>He was leaving the hospital with two guards about 11:20 a.m.</p>
<p>Nouri and the two Hamilton Wentworth Detention Centre guards - who do not carry guns - were walking him back to their white jail van parked at the front of the building.</p>
<p>That's when two men carrying handguns and wearing surgical masks and hoodies pulled low over their faces jumped the guards, knocked them to the ground, then ushered the prisoner into the guards' van and took off.</p>
<p>The guards were shaken, but not hurt. Officials from the detention centre did not return calls. Stuart McGettrick, spokesperson for the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services, refused to discuss security protocol for escorting prisoners to hospital.</p>
<p>Lots of people saw the two masked men, described as being in their 20s, hanging around in front of the hospital before the breakout. Most assumed they were wearing masks because of H1N1.</p>
<p>Stewart says some witnesses said the men were carrying a duffel bag. It was not found at the scene.</p>
<p>The stolen van crashed into an ambulance coming to the hospital, causing minor damage. A few blocks away, the trio dumped the van and got into a waiting silver Hyundai Tiburon.</p>
<p>By noon, police across the province and border guards were conducting a massive search for the men. The Provincial Repeat Offender Parole Enforcement (ROPE) Squad was called in and Toronto police was on alert because of Nouri's ties there.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 imperils computer networks, too; Telecommuting tsunami looms. Few firms have capacity, consultant says</b>
</div><div>ROBERTO ROCHA   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>633 words</div><div>25 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / BREAK</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>If making people sick weren't enough, the H1N1 virus risks claiming another victim: the corporate computer network.</p>
<p>If the swine flu pandemic becomes severe enough, businesses might have to ask a big chunk of their staff to work from home - as much as 60 per cent, according to some projections. But very few companies are prepared to handle that level of telecommuting.</p>
<p>"Companies are very much in react mode when it comes to pandemic preparedness," said Paul Sexton, a consultant at <span class="companylink">IBM Canada</span>'s Business Continuity and Resiliency Services.</p>
<p>"I'm surprised at how many are still only thinking about it."</p>
<p>According to research firm IDC, only one-fifth of companies have a tested pandemic plan in place.</p>
<p>While many companies' systems can handle a 15-per-cent level of telecommuting through remote connections, few have the capacity for a larger contingent. A sudden spike in external access can bring unprepared systems to a halt.</p>
<p>"A lot of companies haven't thought about what kind of work can be done remotely, because not everything can," Sexton added. "They don't know how many concurrent sessions (on a virtual private network) they need."</p>
<p>But computer systems are only one of many factors companies must consider.</p>
<p>Communications and data security can also be a major headache in the event of a full-blown pandemic.</p>
<p>A business operating with high absenteeism still has to be reachable for customers and partners. Companies with call centres are especially vulnerable if agents have to work from home, and it's hard to implement a sophisticated call-routing system during a crisis.</p>
<p>"If a company doesn't have the capability in place now, it will be hard to implement over a week," Sexton said.</p>
<p>He pointed to the restaurant franchise Pizza Pizza as a model. Its call centre system routs all delivery calls to agents at their homes, where most of them work.</p>
<p>But even if calls are properly routed, problems can extend to the home if there's no proper planning.</p>
<p>If a house has only one landline, families might start fighting over who gets to use it, Sexton said.</p>
<p>And it doesn't end there, warned Justin Folkerts, a security analyst at Fusepoint Managed Services in Toronto.</p>
<p>"Is there enough storage on the phone voicemail system to handle inboxes filling up over two weeks?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Do workers have the ability to access email and check their voicemail from home?</p>
<p>"These are the gaps we see as problematic."</p>
<p>The first step any company should take in drafting a pandemic plan, analysts agree, is identify which systems are critical to operations.</p>
<p>Then make sure there's always someone who can manage those systems, either on site or remotely.</p>
<p>"Are there legacy systems that aren't connected to the network?" Folkerts asked. "Do you need people on site to babysit them?"</p>
<p>And managers have to ensure sensitive data remain protected throughout the process.</p>
<p>Password protection and encrypted data are just the basics, Folkerts noted.</p>
<p>When workers leave the office, others have to fill in and companies relax the protected access to their data.</p>
<p>"These relaxed permissions are never put back in place when the worst is over," he said.</p>
<p>Sebastien Ruest, vice-president of the services and technology research group at IDC, urges companies not to take this lightly, as H1N1 could, in a worst-case scenario, reduce staffing by 20 to 30 per cent for an entire year.</p>
<p>"H1N1 is not like a flood or an atomic bomb, it goes in waves," he said. "One employee is out for a week, but he infects three more who, one week later, have to stay home."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Fears of swine flu cast a shadow on the hajj; 2.5M pilgrims. No risk of illness spreading, say Saudi officials</b>
</div><div>AFP</div>
<div>790 words</div><div>25 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>An estimated 2.5 million Muslims have converged on Mecca for the annual hajj pilgrimage, as workers toil around the clock to complete construction projects designed to avoid deadly stampedes.</p>
<p>This year's hajj is also taking place amid fears of the spread of swine flu as pilgrims flood into the kingdom from around the globe.</p>
<p>Four pilgrims have already died from the H1N1 virus, authorities said, but yesterday the health ministry played down the swine flu risk during the hajj.</p>
<p>"There is no risk of the illness spreading as we are well-prepared and have taken the necessary measures" to prevent an outbreak, ministry spokesman Khaled Marghlani told a news conference.</p>
<p>The official SPA news agency quoted senior health ministry official Ziad Mimesh as saying: "The ministry is ready to take care of any case (of swine flu) among pilgrims during the hajj."</p>
<p>All of this year's pilgrims were due in the holy city by late yesterday in time to begin the hajj rites today, Day 1 of the six-day season.</p>
<p>The rites begin with the "tawaf," the circling seven times of the cubic Kabbah building in the centre of the Grand Mosque, in whose direction all Muslims around the world pray. Pilgrims then proceed to Mina to spend the night before climbing Mount Arafat tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Grand Mosque can hold more than one million people, but Saudi hajj authorities have been working to boost its capacity to cope with the steadily rising number of pilgrims.</p>
<p>Work is under way to double the mosque's capacity by adding another 300,000 square metres, according to a hajj official, after King Abdullah agreed two years ago that the northern mosque's esplanades can be expanded.</p>
<p>"We have worked round the clock to complete the expansion. Thanks to God, we have completed the main phase, which included demolishing houses and buildings at the northern end," said Abdulghani, a technician working on the site. "Now the area is ready to install the sunshades."</p>
<p>Hundreds of bulldozers, cranes and trucks were still operating up until yesterday on the expansion work, but the new area will not be ready before next year's hajj.</p>
<p>Other expansion projects have been completed in time, including widening the neighbouring footpath between the Safa and Marwah hills in Mecca that has been turned into a four-level path, allowing a faster flow of pilgrims.</p>
<p>The hajj has been the scene of several tragic accidents caused by surging crowds.</p>
<p>In 2006, 364 pilgrims were killed in a stampede at the entrance of the Jamarat bridge in Mina, east of Mecca, on the last day of the ritual of the stoning of the devil.</p>
<p>More than 100,000 security personnel have been deployed to secure the pilgrims in Mecca and Medina, in addition to 20,000 medical staff.</p>
<p>The Jamarat bridge is also being monitoring by 600 closed-circuit television cameras, while the Grand Mosque and its surroundings are watched by 1,852 cameras.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Who you gonna call to battle H1N1? The mobile germ-killing machine; Company says it has developed technology using ozone gas to kill germs</b>
</div><div>Doug Ward   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>594 words</div><div>25 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>A B.C.-based startup company claims it has developed an ozone gas-based technology that can rid public spaces of the H1N1 influenza virus and other viruses, bacteria and moulds.</p>
<p>Viroforce Systems Inc., a private company considering going public, says it's spent $2.5 million over the past five years developing a mobile germ-killing machine.</p>
<p>Dr. James Hudson, a virologist and Viroforce's chief scientific officer, told a press conference Tuesday that he has discovered the exact combination of ozone, humidity and time required to disinfect a room of all infectious micro-organisms.</p>
<p>"This combination kills 99.9 per cent of every virus that we have tested so far," said Hudson, a professor emeritus at the University of B.C., adding that his kill estimate is a "conservative" one.</p>
<p>Hudson said medical literature has proven that ozone is a potent exterminator of bacteria.</p>
<p>Viroforce's plan is to offer a mobile system to disinfect offices, schools, hotels, planes, ships, hospitals and clinics and other locations of the H1N1 virus and other harmful and infectious organisms.</p>
<p>A Viroforce germ hit squad would seal off the targeted room and use the mobile machine -- equipped with a humidifier and catalytic converter -- to transform the room's oxygen into humidified ozone and then back into oxygen. The whole process takes about 45 minutes. The cost would range from about $250 to $500 for most rooms.</p>
<p>Viroforce is also prepared to sell the machines for $55,000 or lease them.</p>
<p>Dr. Eric Young, B.C.'s deputy provincial health officer, said he was unaware of Viroforce and its claims.</p>
<p>"Like anything else, the devil is in the details. And I haven't heard about this before, or seen it, or read any research about it."</p>
<p>Young said he's been impressed by the infection-control measures being followed in public places, including people coughing into their sleeves and frequently washing their hands.</p>
<p>Viroforce's ozone technology was used commercially for the first time last month at a boarding school for international students in B.C., said David MacLean, the company's vice-president of marketing.</p>
<p>Viroforce was contacted after one of the school's students became infected with the H1N1 virus, said MacLean. The student was put in quarantine and Viroforce employees disinfected much of the school. The student later returned to the school and there was no outbreak of the flu. MacLean could not identify the boarding school, saying the school wanted to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Viroforce's technology has also received third-party validation at a private U.S.-based microbiology laboratory approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. MacLean said Viroforce could not identify the American laboratory without the lab's consent.</p>
<p>Viroforce CEO Nigel Boast said that Viroforce has so far been funded by friends and relatives of the company's principals and by "angel" investors. The company has received $100,000 in funding from the federal National Research Council plus tax credits from the B.C. government, he added. Patent approval is pending.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Banning germs from the workplace</b>
</div><div>Caitlin Crawshaw   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>698 words</div><div>25 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>F1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>With swine flu everywhere and winter on the verge, workplaces all over the country are crossing their fingers that employees get the vaccine and are updating their corporate plans in anticipation of greater employee absenteeism.</p>
<p>But while phone trees and emergency protocols are important, there's a lot that can be done on a daily basis to ward off bugs at work and maintain business as usual throughout the coming months.</p>
<p>Jan Chappell, a senior technical specialist with the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, explains that regular employee hand-washing is crucial.</p>
<p>"People get wound up but really, it's just the normal, everyday stuff that you have to do," she says.</p>
<p>While Chappell isn't aware of any data suggesting a certain frequency of handwashing, doing it with some regularity -- and always after sneezing, eating or using the bathroom -- should suffice. Regular soap and warm water, or gel sanitizers, will get the job done. Like many workplaces, her office has placed a number of dispensers on the walls for easy access.</p>
<p>Because the H1N1 virus travels about one to two metres every time an infected person sneezes or coughs, it's ideal to place workstations at least two metres apart. Ensuring the air in the office is properly ventilated is also important, says Chappell.</p>
<p>Microorganisms often congregate on phones and other shared surfaces and Chappell suggests periodically wiping down these areas, especially if you share a workstation.</p>
<p>While she doesn't condemn handshakes at work, use discretion.</p>
<p>"You can still greet people and be very nice about it, but I think if you're a little bit sick, even with a cold, you should say, 'Sorry, I have a cold,' " says Chappell.</p>
<p>Just as absenteeism can cause serious productivity losses, so can presenteeism. Sick employees really do need to stay home -- especially those who are just starting to have symptoms.</p>
<p>People are most contagious about eight hours before they come down with the flu, when they're just beginning to feel under the weather, she says.</p>
<p>"There's toughing it out and then there's sharing the joy," Chappell says.</p>
<p>As far as office cleaning protocols go, there shouldn't be a need to do anything beyond the usual janitorial methods, says Chappell.</p>
<p>"It's really behaving like a regular flu virus -- it's just new, so more people will get sick. But it's not an abnormal virus in the way it behaves."</p>
<p>Peter Sheldon, a vice-president at Coverall Health-Based Cleaning Systems, believes that not all cleaning methods are equal. He says his company specializes in busting germs in commercial spaces. In his view, certain cleaning strategies can greatly reduce the spread of H1N1 at work.</p>
<p>"In today's world, things have changed. Twenty years ago, we didn't think about organisms coming into the workplace that could potentially kill us," says Sheldon. He says he's not interested in fearmongering but hopes to "educate people to take a defensive posture about potential threats."</p>
<p>Sheldon recommends companies talk to their janitorial service to ensure they're taking certain precautions, including using hospital-grade antibacterial/disinfectant cleaning products, microfibre cleaning cloths, and flat mops rather than conventional string mops.</p>
<p>Certain cleaning techniques are also more effective in reducing cross-contamination, says Sheldon. Single-dip flat mopping keeps clean water from being contaminated; if it becomes contaminated, the mop would simply move around the dirt and germs from room to room.</p>
<p>Because restrooms can be "ground zero for disease transmission," Sheldon suggests no-touch spray and vacuum cleaning, which involves the use of a low-pressure stream of water, chemical injector, wet vac and high-pressure rinse.</p>
<p>Health-based cleaning is generally more efficient, says Sheldon, and shouldn't cost more than traditional cleaning strategies.</p>
<p>"You can't ever eliminate the unseen world. It's always been here and always will be, but you can put yourself in a position to minimize the risks," says Sheldon.</p>

doesn't need to be banned at work, but should be used with
discretion. If you're sick, decline the shake.

<p>Six severe allergic reactions to swine flu vaccinations have been observed in Canada, authorities said Tuesday, adding that all of the individuals are feeling better. All of the cases of anaphylactic shock were linked to a single batch or 172,000 doses of Aprepanrix vaccines made by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> distributed starting on Nov. 2, said Caroline Grondin, a spokeswoman for Health Canada. Distribution of the batch to Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island was halted, Grondin said, but she could not say how many doses had been used before distribution was suspended. Health Canada believes the number of adverse reactions is abnormally high and has asked officials to investigate. One allergic reaction in 100,000 doses is the currently accepted norm.</p>

<p>Pennie Polak will not let H1N1 get in the way of an American tradition.</p>
<p>Hacking, wheezing and hopped up on antibiotics, Polak will be in front of a TV screen tomorrow, watching her beloved Green Bay Packers play the Detroit Lions. Polak is president of the American Women's Club of Montreal. The flu, which she's had for a week, and bronchitis, the latest development, aren't going to ruin Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The AWC has been around for 96 years, but Polak hasn't. Reached by phone yesterday, Polak, who is 60, was a bit short of breath and speaking in an alluring growl reminiscent of - pick your movie star era -</p>
<p>Lauren Bacall or Debra Winger. A native of Wisconsin, Polak was living in Florida and vacationing in the Bahamas in 1986 when she met her Montrealer husband-to-be and moved here the following year.</p>
<p>It was instant infatuation - possibly because she arrived in June.</p>
<p>"But I could have handled the winter," Polak hastens to add.</p>
<p>She cites, as evidence of her Canadian-level hardiness, attendance at the historic 1967 Ice Bowl NFL title game between the Packers and the Dallas Cowboys, when game-time temperature on the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field was minus 25C.</p>
<p>Polak remembers being struck by the beauty of Montreal in the summer. She was only slightly overwhelmed by the experience of adapting to a new city - and a new language on street signs.</p>
<p>"I was always trying to remember what days of the week I could park on which parts of the street. I can't tell you how many tickets I got.</p>
<p>"But people were very friendly. Maybe it's because I was from Florida, and people seem to have an attachment to la Floride."</p>
<p>Polak had been in Montreal for almost 10 years when she joined the American Women's Club. Her husband read an item in The Gazette about the club's Kentucky Derby Day event. They attended, and she joined.</p>
<p>It's one of the city's oldest service clubs. In its earliest days, the American Women's Club was a support group for the allies in the First World War. Montreal women with U.S. roots had a sewing circle and made bandages for the Red Cross.</p>
<p>The AWC's mission, per its website, is "to promote international friendship and understanding, and to support civic and philanthropic projects for the betterment of the community." Beneficiaries of AWC fundraising include the Gazette Christmas Fund, Camp Massawippi, the Old Brewery Mission, Centraide, Sun Youth, the Welcome Hall Mission and the Montreal Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>"Some of us are here for the long haul," Polak said of the AWC membership. "Others are married to Americans who were sent here for work.</p>
<p>"Some of the stories are: 'We lived in Hong Kong, then in Africa and then in Malaysia before we came to Montreal, then we left and we're back again.' Quite a worldly experience."</p>
<p>The club's 100 members have monthly lunch meetings from September through April. In 1992, to mark Montreal's 350th anniversary, the AWC established an annual bursary for a deserving student in North American Studies. The $1,500 bursary was awarded last week to McGill University student Jaclyn Travis during an early-bird Thanksgiving luncheon.</p>
<p>Many late birds will be consumed in American homes tomorrow. Thanksgiving is a huge family holiday in the United States, and Polak is bummed that her illness has precluded a trip to Wisconsin.</p>
<p>"People in the U.S. get home for Thanksgiving any way they can. It's my mother's 89th birthday this Saturday and I had to cancel."</p>
<p>Well, maybe the Packers will win.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tories promise insulin pumps -</b>
</div><div>By Larry Kusch   </div>

</p>
<p>THE Manitoba Tories made a campaign-style health policy promise Tuesday -- 678 days before the next general election.</p>
<p>Conservative Leader Hugh McFadyen vowed that a Conservative government would provide free insulin pumps and supplies for all Manitoba children with Type 1 or juvenile diabetes at an annual cost of just over $2 million a year.</p>
<p>Joining him for the announcement in the PC caucus room at the Legislative Building were two dozen affected Manitobans, including several children who spoke eloquently about what it's like to live with the disease.</p>
<p>"It's the compassionate thing to do for those who are dealing with this condition," McFadyen said. "But it's also the right thing to do in terms of management of our health dollars."</p>
<p>The event was cut short when one of the kids collapsed from a low blood sugar level and, perhaps, an overly warm room. But he was fine a few moments later after drinking some juice.</p>
<p>McFadyen said after the event the Conservatives are not so much in campaign mode as they are seizing the opportunity presented by Gary Doer's departure to gain momentum in the battle of ideas before the next provincial election, set for Oct. 4, 2011.</p>
<p>Doer's successor, Greg Selinger, "hasn't shown much energy" since becoming premier, McFadyen said. "He was absent on the H1N1 story. He has said very little as premier since being selected by the NDP delegates. So from our standpoint we have an opportunity to occupy the space that he has vacated in the public dialogue and to give people a better sense as to where we would go."</p>
<p>But NDP House Leader Bill Blaikie challenged the notion that Selinger has been hiding from the public, saying the Conservative leader seems to want a throne speech debate before the speech is delivered. The throne speech is to be delivered on Monday.</p>
<p>"The new premier has been a virtual whirlwind of activity," attending 32 public events and making 14 announcements since being sworn in Oct. 19, Blaikie said. "He's one of the most energetic people that I know. That's one of the reasons why I supported him for the leadership."</p>
<p>Blaikie said McFadyen would be "misreading the public" if he thought they'd appreciate a two-year election campaign. What Manitobans want is for both the government and the opposition to do their jobs, he said.</p>
<p>The Opposition leader said his party will be making occasional policy announcements before ramping things up in 2011.</p>

<p>The proposal</p>
<p>What the Tories proposed on Tuesday:</p>
<p>If elected, they would spend about $2 million a year to provide free insulin pumps and related supplies to young diabetics (18 and younger).</p>
<p>What are the benefits of a pump?</p>
<p>They allow users to enjoy a more normal life without worrying about frequent injections. Diabetics wear the devices. They're seen as more effective than needles or oral medications and, according to the Canadian Diabetes Association, can help prevent long-term complications from diabetes.</p>
<p>How much do the pumps cost?</p>
<p>Averaged out, the annual cost would be about $4,300 per diabetic per year.</p>
<p>How many young people have the disease in Manitoba?</p>
<p>About 500.</p>

<p>Older adults with pain more likely to fall</p>
<p>Chronic pain is experienced by as many as two out of three older adults. Now, a new study finds chronic pain contributes to an increased risk of fall in older adults.</p>
<p>The study, published in today's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), finds older adults who reported chronic musculoskeletal pain in two or more locations -- mainly in the joints of the arms and legs -- as well as individuals who reported more severe pain or pain that interfered with daily activities were more likely to experience a fall than other individuals.</p>
<p>One of the goals of the study is to better understand what causes falls in older adults to develop new ways to prevent them. The study involved 749 adults older than 70.</p>
<p>New treatment may help serious H1N1 patients</p>
<p>A technology originally developed for premature babies may be helping to save some of the sickest swine flu patients by rerouting their blood so their lungs can rest.</p>
<p>It's a risky approach using equipment that only certain specialized hospitals have.</p>
<p>Some intensive-care doctors are dusting off the machines, named ECMO, that they often consider last-ditch and hardly ever use for influenza.</p>
<p>No one knows which patients are most likely to benefit and not everyone does.</p>
<p>But ECMO is gaining attention after Australian researchers reported that the machines helped during that country's outbreak of their 2009 H1N1 flu strain.</p>
<p>Flashes of light may be sign of retinal tear</p>
<p>Researchers are warning that people who see sudden, persistent "floaters" or flashes of light in their vision could have a serious eye condition that could lead to blindness if left untreated.</p>
<p>A study led by eye specialist Dr. Sanjay Sharma of Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., found that one in seven patients with either floaters or light flashes has a retinal tear that could lead to detachment.</p>
<p>Sharma says that if a doctor detects a retinal tear, it can be repaired by laser treatment before developing into a potentially vision-destroying detachment.</p>
<p>He says many people experience floaters in dim light or while staring at a white surface and they soon disappear. But the sudden onset of dots or cobweb-like floaters that don't go away or flashes in the eye like fireworks could mean a retinal tear or detachment -- especially in older people. The study is published in this week's issue of JAMA.</p>

<p>Lori Hill was coming into work at about 11 a.m. yesterday when she saw two young men standing on the sidewalk, near the front entrance of Hamilton General Hospital, wearing surgical masks. She found it curious, but believed they were just paranoid about H1N1.</p>
<p>"I snickered to myself," said the 48-year-old environmental aide. "People had calmed down over H1N1. It was just strange."</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Shaun Dejonge, 43, was standing by his van near the hospital entrance at about 11:30 a.m., waiting for his wife to retrieve a wheelchair for their son. He had seen the two men sitting on a bench wearing masks, but also believed they were paranoid about the swine flu. A short time later, he heard people yelling, "He's got a gun."</p>
<p>"I was just standing there. ... I didn't see the prisoner, but I saw the two guys running after him, one with a gun, and both wearing black hoods. I thought, 'Oh, this is not right. This is not right.' "</p>
<p>By then, they had jumped into the jail guards' van. He estimated they were about 16 metres away from him and driving the van toward him to get down a driveway. For a second, he worried they might pull by his van, but they took a lane separated from his van by an island. He told his son to duck down in the backseat and knelt down.</p>
<p>"He was a very erratic driver. They were running over the curb and smashing into the ambulance. He was a very dangerous driver, but they didn't care. They were obviously very desperate."</p>
<p>He estimates the men were gone within 45 seconds.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Jim, who declined to give his last name, was waiting for his wife to come out of surgery in a third-floor waiting room overlooking the hospital's front entrance.</p>
<p>"I was sitting right at the window and I heard, I'm not sure, a woman saying something like 'My God,' " said the senior. "Just as I looked out, I saw the van go over a curb. It was kind of turning around and getting out of here. Guards were waving their hands, watching the van go down the driveway."</p>
<p>He said police arrived soon after. He had a good idea a prisoner had escaped custody.</p>
<p>"When you see guards out there looking at a van driving away, you can put two and two together," Jim said.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Sylvia, who declined to give her last name, was also in a third-floor waiting room with her daughter. They were there for her son, who was undergoing day surgery.</p>
<p>She was knitting, but says her daughter looked out the window in time to see the men run to the van and drive away.</p>
<p>"She said, 'Look at that,' then all of a sudden, there were a whole bunch of cops," said the 68-year-old. "There was a whole lot of confusion. You couldn't tell the guards from the cops."</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>A couple of workers at a nearby business on Birge Street say they saw the van whip around the corner.</p>
<p>"The white van that's parked there, it came flying by us going eastbound," said one of the workers, who wouldn't give his name. "It was going really fast -- that's what caught our attention about it."</p>
<p>He said it stopped abruptly "and the driver got out of the driver's side and when he came back around the front of the van, he had the guy in the orange jumpsuit ... he was kind of helping him (the prisoner) walk."</p>
<p>He said the driver took what looked like a gym bag with him into a car and that he thought he heard chains shuffling along the ground when the prisoner got out of the van. Another worker said they saw a man waiting in what they think was a silver Hyundai from as early as 10:30 a.m.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu reaches peak in Ukraine; 1.6 million fall ill, while 388 die in three weeks</b>
</div><div>Peter Goodspeed   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>781 words</div><div>25 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>All But Toronto</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>After three weeks of panic, pandemonium and politics, the initial swine flu pandemic in Ukraine has peaked.</p>
<p>Today the government is expected to end a nationwide ban on public gatherings, lift travel restrictions and order the reopening of parliament, schools and universities in all but 11 regions.</p>
<p>But the country, with its anemic health-care system, is still reeling from having 1.6 million people fall sick with the flu, resulting in the hospitalization of 97,000 people and the deaths of 388 in three weeks.</p>
<p>At the height of the frenzy, tens of thousands were becoming ill each day, dozens were dying and the Ukraine navy said it could not carry out combat duty because of a lack of manpower.</p>
<p>The National Security & Defence Council said there were constitutional prerequisites to declare a state of emergency and politicians briefly talked of postponing presidential elections, scheduled for Jan. 17.</p>
<p>A rising death toll added fear to the emotions rattling Ukraine as it ran out of essential medicines and supplies.</p>
<p>Pharmacies looked like Soviet-era shops with long lines of customers queuing for nonexistent surgical masks and cold medicines. The Health Ministry's stock of Tamiflu, an anti-viral designed to slow the spread of influenza, was used up in days and people began to hoard lemons and garlic for homemade cures.</p>
<p>Ukraine's fragile health system was soon paralyzed and rumours proliferated that people were dying of a new, more lethal strain of influenza virus.</p>
<p>As the World Health Organization rushed a nine-member outbreak assessment team to Ukraine in early November, politicians rounded on each other, predicting mass illness and death.</p>
<p>President Viktor Yushchenko declared his country had been hit simultaneously by two seasonal flus and the "California" (swine) flu, and blamed his political arch-rival, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko for failing to prepare for the outbreak.</p>
<p>Ms. Tymoshenko, who is running for president, provided daily television updates on the pandemic and appeared in public swathed in hospital gowns and wearing a surgical mask. She criticized her rivals for hindering her efforts to end the pandemic.</p>
<p>When parliament voted to spend US$125-million to fight the flu, Mr. Yushchenko refused to authorize it, saying it</p>
<p>would fuel inflation. Instead, he launched his own appeal for foreign aid.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, presidential frontrunner Viktor Yanukovich, a former prime minister and leader of the Regions' Party, pledged to use election campaign donations to buy flu medicine and 20 million surgical masks.</p>
<p>"Ukrainian politicians, including the two main presidential candidates, do not really care about the fate of their people," columnist Kateryna Grushenko wrote in the Kyiv Post. "They allowed themselves to turn the H1N1 epidemic into a PR show during days when educational, medical, and society-oriented coverage should have been provided to the population."</p>
<p>As the pandemic entrenched itself, straining hospitals and emergency rooms to the breaking point, Ukraine's panic grew. With no authoritative explanation for what was happening, bloggers and conspiracy theorists suggested the country was in the grip of a mysterious, more lethal virus.</p>
<p>The government and WHO were deliberately playing down the pandemic's death toll, some suggested.</p>
<p>When Norwegian scientists announced they had found a mutated form of the swine flu virus that could infect deeper into the airways and cause more severe disease, Ukraine's news media began reporting that doctors conducting postmortems on some patients had found their lungs had virtually disintegrated.</p>
<p>The WHO tried to temper the sensational reports saying "viruses with similar mutations had been detected in several other countries, including Brazil, China, Japan, Mexico, Ukraine and the United States."</p>
<p>"No links between the small numbers of patients infected with the mutated virus have been found and the mutation does not appear to spread," it added.</p>

<p>Question: The H1N1 vaccine was tested very quickly. How can I be sure that getting immunized is safe to do?</p>
<p>Answer: It may seem the H1N1 vaccine was developed, tested and brought to market very quickly. H1N1 emerged in April and vaccine was delivered in October. However, the annual seasonal vaccine is produced on a very similar timeline each year. Typically, the seasonal influenza strains are identified in March and the vaccine is developed, tested, and distributed for seasonal flu campaigns in October.</p>
<p>H1N1 vaccine clinical trials have been conducted in Canada, the United States and throughout the world. It has been demonstrated the vaccine is as safe and effective as seasonal influenza vaccines. This was necessary before the vaccine was distributed in Canada.</p>
<p>As with any medicine, vaccines carry a small risk of a serious adverse reaction. These reactions could include difficulty breathing, shock or anaphylaxis. The vast majority of adverse reactions are mild: irritation or swelling at the injection site, headache, minor pain in the arm, etc. When you receive the vaccine, you will be asked to stay for 15 minutes after receiving your immunization to ensure you do not experience an adverse reaction. Most serious reactions are likely to occur quickly and nursing staff is equipped to respond quickly.</p>
<p>Public health officials encourage all residents to receive the H1N1 vaccine. It provides you with immunity to the illness without having to contract the virus. However, it remains your choice. All vaccinations in Saskatchewan are voluntary.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health workers rolling up sleeves</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>

<div>627 words</div><div>25 November 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>There has been a high demand for the H1N1 vaccine among health-care workers, which comes as a pleasant surprise to hospital administrators and health organizations that traditionally have had a hard time convincing them to roll up their sleeves.</p>
<p>Dr. Gerald Evans, president of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada, said that through a Public Health Agency of Canada committee that he sits on, he's heard consistent reports about a high uptake of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>"I can tell you statistics that I've seen showed that among most health-care worker groups it's about 70 per cent take-up for the pandemic flu vaccine and that's way in excess of the usual 30 or 40 per cent that we see for seasonal flu," said Evans, head of the infectious disease division at Kingston General Hospital in Kingston, Ont.</p>
<p>The University Health Network, which covers three major hospitals in Toronto, says that approximately 10,500 out of about 12,000 employees received their H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>"We really tried to emphasize getting people vaccinated here, so we've been really pleased with the numbers," said Dr. Susy Hota, an infectious disease specialist. "We could barely keep up with the demand when we first rolled this out, in terms of our supply."</p>
<p>Hota said she doesn't believe doctors, nurses and other staff were pressured to take the vaccine.</p>
<p>"We've always made it clear that it's strongly recommended but it's not mandatory, and I think that the benefit of that is you're not coercing people," she said.</p>
<p>When the H1N1 pandemic arrived and the vaccine to combat it was in development there was much speculation about how many health-care workers would get the vaccine. They were being urged to take the vaccine to protect not only themselves but also their patients and the discussion also renewed a debate about whether the shots should be mandatory for health-care workers. The H1N1 vaccine is not mandatory for anyone in Canada.</p>
<p>Collective agreements for unionized workers lay out certain working conditions during a pandemic for those who do not want to be vaccinated, either for medical or non-medical reasons. If the chief medical officer for the community declares an outbreak in a ward of a hospital, staff on that ward must be vaccinated or should be offered antiviral medication that can be used before exposure to the virus, a strategy known as prophylaxis.</p>
<p>Union organizations for nurses say the collective agreements are clear and well-understood by staff and they are not aware of any problems during this pandemic.</p>
<p>Linda Silas, president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions, said the vaccine uptake has been "surprisingly high" and in some places has reached 90 per cent.</p>
<p>She said there was a good education campaign to inform health-care staff about the new vaccine. She also pointed to the high-profile death of an Ontario teen during the first week the vaccine was available as an event that changed public opinion about immunization and also influenced health-care workers.</p>
<p>She said there was a widespread sense of pressure for people to get vaccinated, but it was felt no more by health-care workers than by the general public.</p>
<p>"The pressure was there. Canada reacted in a high-profile manner with H1N1 and put a lot of pressure on everyone, including health-care workers. We didn't see the pressure more on health-care workers than on the general public," she said.</p>
<p>Final numbers of the uptake of the H1N1 vaccine among nurses will be collected by the occupational health and safety committees of local unions, said Silas.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Plenty of funds for executive bonuses</b>
</div><div>Warren (Smokey) Thomas   </div>
<div>The Windsor Star</div>

<p>Windsor Regional Hospital CEO David Musyj has attacked a recent arbitration decision that gave hospital professionals such as pharmacists, lab technologists and physiotherapists a wage increase of 2.5 per cent per year. Musyj argues the province cannot afford such an increase given falling revenues.</p>
<p>When Musyj transitioned from vice-president to president, his own compensation package increased in 2008 by $66,449 to $276,634 -- that's nearly a 32 per cent jump.</p>
<p>While he believes front-line workers should sacrifice their own economic well-being to bail out the province, there is little sign that other executives are being asked to make such sacrifices. The province didn't hesitate to give a package to the deputy minister of Health and Long Term Care that's worth more than double the provincial guideline.</p>
<p>Sarah Kramer, the former head of eHealth, was given a bonus of $114,000 just months into her job.</p>
<p>A few months later, they severed her for an additional $317,000 after a scathing report by the auditor questioning $1 billion spent at the agency.</p>
<p>Rather than revisit an orderly bargaining system that has arrived at fair wage settlements without labour disruption, Musyj would be much more productively engaged in trying to persuade Queen's Park that a freeze on hospital funding in the midst of an H1N1 pandemic is a bad idea. Musyj may also want to encourage the Ontario Hospital Association to settle at the bargaining table in future rounds, a choice they could have made this time.</p>
<p>I'm sure the government would argue executives like Musyj and Kramer are hard to retain and recruit--so are good pharmacists, lab techs, physiotherapists and nearly 200 other professions that care for hospital patients.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it's not these professionals that are looking for gold-plated bonuses in the midst of a recession.</p>

<p>A new poll of 800 Saskatchewan residents has found a majority thinks the province's health officials have done a "fair" or "poor" job of managing the distribution of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>The poll also found 39 per cent of residents think the province has done a "good" or "excellent" job of distributing the vaccine, and those living in Regina were most likely to say the province was doing a fair, good or excellent job.</p>
<p>However, when Insightrix completed the survey from Nov. 6 to Nov. 10, slightly more than half of the province's residents (53.5 per cent) said they planned to, or had already received, an H1N1 immunization. That number was up from an early October survey, which found 36 per cent planned to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Also earlier this month, the poll found 66.4 per cent of respondents were either "very" or "somewhat" concerned about catching H1N1. Despite warnings from health officials that young adults could be at higher risk from the virus, respondents aged 18 to 34 were least worried about catching the bug. Women were also more worried than men about getting H1N1, or about someone in their household catching the virus.</p>
<p>The poll found people have also stepped up preventative behaviours since early October, including avoiding touching one's eyes, nose and mouth, limiting physical contact with others and drinking hot liquids or gargling with salt water or antiseptic more frequently.</p>

</p>
<p>Nov. 25 is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and kicks off 16 days of action.</p>
<p>Why do we need a day and why do we need 16 days of action?</p>
<p>Nov. 25 was picked because on that day, in 1960, three activist sisters were murdered under the orders of the Dominican Republic dictator Rafuel Trujillo. The day was marked by the United Nations in 1999, and this year marks its 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>The days of action end on Dec. 10, International Human Rights Day. The purpose is to draw attention to violence against women as a human rights issue. In Canada, this year will mark the 20th anniversary of the Montreal Massacre.</p>
<p>Dec. 6, 1989, is one of those days where you never forget where you were when the news hit. Like the day John Lennon was shot, or when the airplanes hit the Twin Towers.</p>
<p>I came home from work with my two-year-old son in tow and turned on the news. My heart stopped and I stood there in shock watching the coverage and the story unfold.</p>
<p>At the time, I was a volunteer at Guelph Wellington Women in Crisis. I knew all too well the implications of what Marc Lepine had done, when he yelled: "I hate feminists," as he separated the women from the men and shot the women at Ecole Polytechnique.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine someone so full of hatred. But, as a volunteer at the shelter, I saw the results of such hatred on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The statistics in Canada are dismal. In 2008, there were 146 female victims of homicide. Of those, 45 were murdered by their spouse or ex-spouse, according to Statistics Canada.</p>
<p>We have a Highway of Tears in B.C. where women have gone missing and are presumed dead. For aboriginal women in this country, every highway is a highway of tears. According to Beverley Jacobs, of the Native Women's Association of Canada, over the last 20 years there have been an estimated 520 aboriginal women who have been murdered or reported missing across Canada. It's a dirty little secret we don't like to acknowledge.</p>
<p>Most of the women who have been murdered along the Highway of Tears are aboriginal, as were most of the victims Robert Pickton is accused of killing. This is an urgent issue that requires attention from several federal ministries, yet none is taking action. The only province doing anything is Manitoba, where there are 75 missing aboriginal women to date. It has formed a special task force to try to solve cases of murdered and missing women.</p>
<p>H1N1 has killed relatively few people across this country and yet has caused a media sensation as well as swift government action. So why is there so little action when it comes to the epidemic death rate of aboriginal women murdered in this country?</p>
<p>The answer is systemic racism and indifference to the issues of violence against women. Women are targeted because they are women, rarely are men targeted for the same reason. Are aboriginal women targeted because perpetrators believe that can get away with it if they victimize such an individual? After all, when an aboriginal woman goes missing, they must know it may be weeks before it will be taken seriously.</p>
<p>We need to change these inequalities through awareness of the reasons why these inequalities exist. This is a human rights issue.</p>
<p>When I put my son to bed that cold December night and watched him fall to sleep, I made a promise to him. I promised to teach him to honour and work for equality. In other words, I promised to raise him with a feminist consciousness. He has not disappointed me - neither has that choice.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Universities' H1N1 policies please students</b>
</div><div>By Michelle McQuigge   </div>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Guillaume Blais was due to write a midterm the day he started showing symptoms of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>A day later, when the University of Guelph student was scheduled to write another test, he laid low with a fever, sore body and crushing fatigue.</p>
<p>The ensuing week saw Blais confined to his home and resigning himself to a term marred by additional assignments or more heavily weighted finals that would compensate for the three mid-terms he missed.</p>
<p>But the university soon allayed his fears by allowing him - as well as dozens of other sick students - to write their tests once they had recovered.</p>
<p>"I actually had one prof who sat down with me and said ‘what works for you? Let's make it work,'" Blais said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>His experience is being replicated on campuses across the country. Universities say parents and pupils alike need not fear that their hard-earned tuition dollars will go to waste if H1N1 flu strikes.</p>
<p>Officials say they're making every effort to remain flexible in the face of an ever-changing pandemic situation and are striving to ensure the academic experience is not derailed by the virus.</p>
<p>Schools that are already dealing with a wave of H1N1 on campus have adapted their academic policies and adjusted exam periods to accommodate those students laid low by the virulent flu, and those who have dodged the bullet so far are prepared to make the same concessions if conditions change.</p>
<p>Medical notes - which were once mandatory for students who contracted severe flu symptoms - were no longer compulsory as of mid-October, said Dr. Pierre-Paul Tellier, director of student health services at McGill University, echoing a similar policy enacted at Guelph.</p>
<p>Those who do fall ill have only to report their condition online and devote their time to recovering.</p>
<p>Brenda Whiteside, associate vice-president of student affairs at Guelph, said the university's pandemic plan covered nearly all aspects of campus life except for the unexpected strain the vaccination effort put on the school's medical staff.</p>
<p>The decision to offer H1N1 flu shots on campus further exacerbated the strain on personnel who were already overtaxed by the wave of sick students, she said.</p>
<p>Other campus efforts have gone toward the protection of healthy students.</p>
<p>"One of the messages we got out is ‘if you're sick, stay home,' and that's really hard to convince people to do," Whiteside said, adding that roughly 10 per cent of the campus population has likely been infected in recent weeks.</p>

<p>The fall sitting of the Alberta legislature is limping to a conclusion and will likely be done this week.</p>
<p>If this was a horse, we would have shot it days ago.</p>
<p>In question period, we seem to be going through the motions with the opposition pretending to ask questions and the government pretending to answer them.</p>
<p>Actually, the government has even given up that pretence.</p>
<p>On Monday, Health Minister Ron Liepert apparently either didn't know how to answer questions from Liberal Leader David Swann or he couldn't be bothered.</p>
<p>Swann wondered why Alberta has the highest level of deaths and hospitalizations from swine flu in the country, according to the federal government's Public Health Agency. Alberta's hospitalization rate is 50 per cent above the national average while the death rate is 80 per cent higher.</p>
<p>They are disturbing numbers, and when Swann first mentioned them a few days ago, he was quoted in media reports as blaming the deaths on the government.</p>
<p>By Monday, though, Swann had softened his tone considerably in question period. He asked a straightforward question about why Alberta has "nearly twice the death rate of the rest of the country?"</p>
<p>Not only did Liepert know the question was coming, his department officials said he would deal with it. However, Liepert sidestepped the question completely: "I don't have those numbers in front of me. I think, you know, this morning was a major corner that we turned in this province because starting this morning all Albertans are eligible to receive the vaccination in this province. You know, we can continue to drag up all of the statistics and all of the negative comments we want, but the key thing is that some 650,000 Albertans have now been vaccinated and by Christmas we anticipate every Albertan that wants to be vaccinated, can be vaccinated."</p>
<p>Swann shot back that the minister "is not going to duck responsibility that easily."</p>
<p>And then Liepert did just that, saying the government and Alberta Health Services have "reacted appropriately."</p>
<p>It was an odd, unsatisfying exchange. Swann pulled his punches and Liepert didn't even try to bob and weave.</p>
<p>The explanation for their limp altercation might lie in the fact the Public Health Agency's figures are neither complete nor up to date. Provinces are still reporting their numbers. It is simply too early to say whether Alberta indeed has a higher incidence of death and infection from swine flu than anywhere else in Canada. Alberta's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Andre Corriveau, says the pandemic hit Alberta early and the province has been quick to report all cases to federal health officials, unlike some other provinces.</p>
<p>"You really have to wait until the wave is further along to compare totals and if reporting delays are different from one province to another," says Corriveau. "Some provinces, at least up to this past week, were only reporting deaths that were caused by H1N1 while we've been reporting every death where somebody was diagnosed with H1N1, whether they died from a heart attack or some other underlying conditions...We report them all."</p>
<p>It would seem Swann, himself a doctor, knows he can't say for sure anyone did die because of the government's at-times confused vaccination program. And Liepert couldn't definitively say they didn't.</p>
<p>It'll come down t o a matter of trust. Does the public trust the government when it says it did the best it could to plan for and react to the swine flu pandemic?</p>
<p>The initial response would seem to be "no," based on a recent public opinion poll that indicated almost 60 per cent of Albertans were unhappy with how health officials dealt with the pandemic, the highest disapproval rate in the country.</p>
<p>Trust -- it's something the government seems to running short of these days. The most contentious piece of legislation--Bill 50 (the Electric Statutes Amendment Act) --is as much about public trust as electrical transmission. The government will ram the bill through this week, arguing the legislation is needed to upgrade the province's aging electricity grid. The opposition, supported by public-interest groups and expert opinion, says the legislation is not only unnecessary but tramples on the democratic rights of landowners.</p>
<p>It is a confusing and complicated issue that, like most things in politics, will come down to this question: who do you trust?</p>
<p>Do you trust the government?Do you trust power companies?</p>
<p>You might be surprised by the answers some people give.</p>
<p>On Monday, reporters asked Energy Minister Mel Knight if he has signed one of the long-term electricity contracts being pushed on us by power companies and government legislation.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to sign one, I don't want one," said Knight. "The cheapest power in the province of Alberta happens to be the spot market. That's where it is. You have to ride through the ups and downs, but at the end of the day it would be my feeling that the market is actually prevailing in the province and it will probably end up with the lowest cost of electricity."</p>
<p>That leaves one question the opposition should ask before the fall sitting ends:Why should any Albertan sign a long-term power contract if the energy minister won't?</p>

</p>
<p>On any given day, I'm sure all sorts of things are said about Alberta's premier.</p>
<p>Of course, not every comment gets the premier's attention-- or the media's, for that matter.</p>
<p>As we saw last week, though, some remarks very much get noticed. Stephen Carter is chief of staff to Wildrose Alliance leader Danielle Smith. He offered Premier Ed Stelmach an apology after comments were posted on Twitter which seemed to mock the way the premier speaks: "dem media" and "dat was quite a speech", for example.</p>
<p>Sophomoric and cheap, yes. Worthy of an apology, sure. Beyond the pale? Not exactly. It's worthwhile, though, to contrast the remarks from Carter and those from Dr. David Swann, leader of the Alberta Liberals. As far as I can tell, no apology has been offered from him, and as of this writing no apology has been sought.</p>
<p>Not that I spend copious amounts of time assessing and ranking the sorts of insults I might wish to be hurled my way, but I'm pretty sure that being called a stammering yokel might be slightly less grievous that being accused of having blood on my hands.</p>
<p>Dr. Swann has certainly made himself more relevant as of late with his sharp criticism of how the government handled its vaccination program. Frankly, much of his criticism has been spot-on.</p>
<p>I fear, though, he may have overplayed his hand here: if you're going to accuse someone of having blood on his hands, you'd better be able to demonstrate that the blood is indeed there.</p>
<p>Late last week, Swann accused the Stelmach government of being responsible for deaths linked to H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The rationale here is that because the vaccination program was poorly run, it's possible that those in high risk groups were not vaccinated and it's then possible that some of those individuals who might have been vaccinated through a properly run program instead contracted H1N1 influenza and subsequently died.</p>
<p>It's a plausible scenario. Unfortunately for Swann, he has put forth no evidence to suggest that it occurred.</p>
<p>In fact, Swann has all but admitted that he doesn't know: rather than presenting evidence he is the one asking for it. It's almost like a police officer charging someone with murder and then asking the suspect if he has any evidence that could help make the charge stick.</p>
<p>By all means, let's look into whether at-risk individuals fell through the gaping cracks in the early days of the vaccination program.</p>
<p>However, there are several problems with a simple narrative like this. And being a medical doctor, Swann ought to be aware of them.</p>
<p>First of all, vaccinations didn't begin until late October and could not have begun any sooner--by that point, this flu season was well underway.</p>
<p>Second, it can take up to two weeks for the vaccine to take effect, so any death prior to mid-November could not realistically be attributed to a poorly planned vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we're not exactly talking about a tetanus shot--flu shots can decrease your likelihood of getting the flu, but it's not a guarantee. It's less effective in the elderly and those with weakened immune systems: the very people who may have succumbed to flu-related complications.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that Alberta's death toll includes those who died from other causes, but also tested positive for H1N1.</p>
<p>Bottom line: we don't know if any of the flu-related deaths in the last two weeks involve anyone who was unable to get vaccinated. We also can't say for sure if the vaccine would have made enough of a difference.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a pretty flimsy basis for saying the government is directly responsible for any deaths.</p>
<p>None of this is to say the government deserves a pass --quite the contrary.</p>
<p>However, if the opposition is going to resort to over-the-top, unproven allegations, then in lieu of any serious criticism, the government will effectively have been given a pass.</p>
<p>Those tasked with holding the government to account need to rise above such cheap shots.</p>

<p>The Gatineau Olympiques are in good health, but they have fallen victim to the H1N1 virus just the same.</p>
<p>Gatineau's Quebec Major Junior Hockey League game Monday night in Val-d'Or against the Foreurs was postponed after the Foreurs informed the league that a couple of players may have the virus and that others were showing symptoms.</p>
<p>In other eras, the game might have gone on with Val-d'Or short-handed, but that is not the case in present-day junior hockey.</p>
<p>"It's a different landscape out there today," Gatineau head coach Jerome Dupont said Monday. "Doctors don't take chances. There are too many issues.</p>
<p>"And I had mixed emotions in any event. From our standpoint, it would have been our third (game) in four nights, and we're banged up a little, too."</p>
<p>The Olympiques played at home Friday night against Victoriaville, then headed north for a game Sunday in Rouyn-Noranda. The team had just returned to their hotel following a 3-0 victory against the Huskies in a 4 p.m. start when the call came, confirming that they would not play Monday.</p>
<p>No makeup date had been announced as of Monday.</p>
<p>Gatineau plays in Montreal Friday night before playing host to the Shawinigan Cataractes on Sunday afternoon at 4 at the Robert Guertin Arena.</p>

<p>The Ottawa 67's Tyler Toffoli has been named the Ontario Hockey League player of the week.</p>
<p>Toffoli, 17, from Scarborough, Ont., led the league in scoring with four goals and four assists in three games.</p>
<p>Senators draft pick Robin Lehner of the Sault St. Marie Greyhounds was also considered for the award after winning all three of his starts. The goaltender registered two shutouts while stopping 74 of the 76 shots he faced.</p>

<p>Demand for flu vaccinations is still strong in Ottawa, and the supply is holding out, at least for now.</p>
<p>Most of the public clinics have been fully booked hours before their doors open.</p>
<p>Clinics in Kanata, Orléans, City Hall, Jim Durrell Arena and Barrhaven, as well as the Constellation (Centrepointe) clinic, which opens later in the day, were all fully booked before 1 p.m. Monday.</p>
<p>There were still nearly 200 wristbands available at Tom Brown Arena in the early afternoon, but they ran out soon after the 2:30 p.m. opening. That clinic and the one in Vanier have generally been slower to fill up than the other clinics.</p>
<p>There are approximately 100 family doctors also offering H1N1 flu shots, but their vaccine supplies vary and some are still restricting the shots to children and adults with medical problems.</p>
<p>The city's medical officer of health, Dr. Isra Levy, said vaccine supply should be enough to meet the city's needs "this week," but it would help to have more.</p>

</div><div>PAT DONNELLY   </div>

</p>
<p>As the 32nd edition of the 2009 Salon du livre wound down yesterday, two final prizes were handed out.</p>
<p>Michel Tremblay took the Prix du Grand Public fiction award for La Traversée de la ville, the second book in a trilogy about his mother's life. This was the third year in a row that Tremblay took the award, for a total of five wins since the prize, now in its 27th year, was established.</p>
<p>"Three in a row. It's absolutely incredible," said Tremblay as he accepted the award.</p>
<p>The non-fiction Prix du Grand Public went to Richard Béliveau for La Santé par le plaisir de bien manger.</p>
<p>Béliveau, a biochemist best known for his earlier book Cuisiner avec les aliments contre cancer (Foods That Fight Cancer), co-authored with Denis Gingras, couldn't be there. He was too busy shooting his Radio-Canada television show Destination Santé.</p>
<p>The Prix du Grand Public awards are chosen by votes cast by visitors to Montreal's annual French-language book fair. Each prize includes a purse of $2,000.</p>
<p>Winning an award like this, one whose recipient is chosen by the public, is "good for the soul," Tremblay said.</p>
<p>Salon president René Bon-enfant announced that attendance during the six-day fair was 120,000, the same as last year. Publisher Pascal Assathiany of Éditions du Boréal said attendance seemed about the same as in other years. But a bookseller at the Benjamin kiosk said his numbers were definitely down from last year, and blamed that on the H1N1 flu scare.</p>
<p>Among other prizes handed out during the Salon were the purely honorary Prix Fleury-Mesplet, to Lise Bissonnette in recognition of her leadership during 11 years as president and general director of the Grande Bibliothèque de Montréal, and the $1,000 Prix Alvine-Bélisle for young people's literature, given to Charlotte Gingras for Ophélie.</p>

<p>Many adjectives could be used to describe the H1N1 virus, but it's safe to say that "cuddly" isn't among them.</p>
<p>That, however, is the irreverent characterization being applied by the Delaware company behind GIANTmicrobes, a bizarre line of incongruously cute plush dolls.</p>

<p>Cheryl Gray knew she had a problem on her hands when cleaning staff in one of the buildings she was responsible for started showing up to work with masks.</p>
<p>It was the summer of 2003 and severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, had hit Canada's largest city. By the end of the outbreak there were 443 probable cases, with 44 deaths. Tenants in her Toronto buildings were clamouring for information. Was it even safe to touch the elevator buttons?</p>
<p>Gray, a senior vice-president at Canadian property manager and developer <span class="companylink">Bentall Capital</span>, knew she had to be prepared if there was a next time. "There was a lot of angst amongst tenants and we really didn't have a clear game plan on what to do," Gray said.</p>
<p>What Gray did was create what some describe as the gold standard of pandemic planning for commercial buildings in North America.</p>
<p>Gray's obscure manual is getting more attention today after long lines for H1N1 flu vaccination shots in Ontario created a heightened sense of urgency for Canadian businesses. About 2.5 million people have been vaccinated in three weeks, with 198 deaths across the country.</p>
<p>Apart from the health implications, the virus can have severe consequences on the economy if commercial and retail operations close.</p>
<p>Written in the wake of the SARS epidemic, the manual is considered the go-to document in pandemic preparedness, written on the front lines by property managers like Gray who were at the epicentre of the SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>"We were caught by surprise with SARS, and Cheryl took the initiative to reach out to the industry so we could collectively come up with a game plan," said Diana Osler-Zortea, president of the Building Owners and Managers Association of Canada, which represents commercial real estate landlords.</p>
<p>"We really needed to figure out how you continue to service everyone when all your workers are sick. How would your business continue in the event of an emergency?"</p>
<p>At the time, Gray was responsible for managing 20 million square feet of properties in eastern Canada, mostly in Toronto. After the SARS outbreak, she got in touch with other members of BOMA, a group whose members include major landlords such as Redcliffe Realty, <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span> and Oxford Properties, and formed a group that met monthly for 18 months to prepare the 95-page document now used by building managers worldwide.</p>
<p>The committee used input from not just real estate experts, but legal, insurance and medical experts as well. Toronto microbiologist Dr. Donald Low is also a consultant.</p>
<p>Ralph Dunham, managing director of risk consultancy <span class="companylink">Marsh Canada Ltd</span>., said he uses the guide as a good starting point for clients.</p>
<p>"Not only is it a gold standard in the North American real estate industry, but it is valuable to other non-real estate organizations," he said.</p>
<p>"Each company is different, but the principles of preparedness are the same."</p>
<p>The guide looks at basic issues such as how to maintain contact with tenants and employees, preparing for the possibility of closure, travel policies, education and even rent defaults by tenants in the wake of a pandemic.</p>
<p>It discusses whether there is even a legal obligation for owners and building managers to have a pandemic plan. It argues employers have a duty to do this because legislation requires that they maintain a safe workplace.</p>
<p>"We tried to look at everything that could happen," said Gray. "If the cleaning company has a 40 per cent absenteeism rate, how are you going to cope with cleaning the premises effectively? Another example might be that some people may not want to take public transit during an outbreak, so they drive in. How do you respond to the need for extra parking spaces?"</p>
<p>Over the past year the guide has been fine-tuned with more input from stakeholders. Gray says it is necessarily a work in progress as building managers learn from the real world.</p>
<p>"When I finished working on the first manual, I was hoping it would have some value one day. I just didn't think it would be this soon," said Gray.</p>
<p>"People thought, well, that's interesting, but I guess it didn't have the kind of relevance and immediacy it has now."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Farmers' gross income holds steady in Manitoba -</b>
</div><div>By Murray McNeill   </div>

</p>
<p>Manitoba farmers' gross income held steady over the first nine months of this year, despite a three per cent decline in the third quarter alone, according to new Statistics Canada figures.</p>
<p>Manitoba farmers recorded $3.6 billion in farm cash receipts for the January to September period in both 2008 and 2009, the agency said Monday.</p>
<p>But for the third quarter alone, cash receipts dropped to $1.1 billion from $1.14 billion in 2008.</p>
<p>At the national level, the numbers were even less encouraging, with farm cash receipts dropping by 4.2 per cent for the first nine months and 11.8 per cent for the third quarter.</p>
<p>This reflected declines in crop and livestock sales, and less money made available from government programs. Farm cash receipts include income from crop and livestock sales and from government programs. They do not represent the bottom line for producers, who still have to deduct their expenses, loan costs, and depreciation to arrive at their net income. Overall cash receipts for Canadian farms came to $32.8 billion during 2009's first three quarters, compared to $34.2 billion during the same time a year earlier. Last year was a record year for Canadian farming revenue.</p>
<p>This year, livestock sales were down 2.8 per cent to $13.5 billion for the first nine months, StatsCan said. "Canada's livestock sector has been affected by a strong Canadian dollar, concerns about the H1N1 flu virus and U.S. country-of-origin labelling legislation, which has put downward pressure on U.S. demand for live animals," the agency said in a statement.</p>
<p>Crop sales were down 1.4 per cent to $16.8 billion. StatsCan said volumes were actually up, but the decline came as a result of lower prices for gains and oilseeds. Government program payments were down 24.5 per cent to $2.4 billion during the first nine months of this year.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada said the decline in program payments was probably mostly linked to higher incomes for farmers in 2008. She noted that subsidies based any given year's income are paid out the following year.In Manitoba, the biggest percentage decline in cash receipts was in program payments, which were down 24.7 per cent for the first nine months. Crop and livestock receipts, on the other hand, were up by 2.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively.</p>
<p>Although the preliminary net income figures for 2009 won't be available until next May, StatsCan did release the final net income figures for 2008 on Monday.</p>
<p>Manitoba farmers' saw their net income fall by $24 million, or 7.1 per cent, to $312 million from $336 million in 2007.</p>
<p>That bucked the national trend which saw farmers' net income in Canada climb by $79.2 million to $3.6 billion in 2008.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Chickenpox no reason to keep kids home; Despite experts' recommendations, children with mild cases are barred from some schools for five days</b>
</div><div>LISA PRIEST   </div>

</p>
<p>Even though pediatricians have said for years that children with mild chickenpox are well enough to attend school or daycare, kids continue to be banned from those facilities for five days in what some say amounts to scare over science.</p>
<p>Not only are these exclusion policies hard for children who unnecessarily miss school, but they are also difficult for parents who must take time off work or hire care, said Noni MacDonald, a pediatric infectious disease specialist based in Halifax.</p>
<p>“One should be encouraging school boards and public health to have a policy that's evidence-based, and not give in to scare tactics and complaints from parents who are ignorant about what the real risks are,” said Dr. MacDonald, principal author of the Canadian Paediatric Society's statement on chickenpox and exclusion policies.</p>
<p>Since 1994, the society has recommended that the only children with chickenpox who should be excluded are those who are feverish or so ill that they require more care than can be provided by school or daycare personnel.</p>
<p>The recommendation is based on epidemiological studies and virology data, which show that the exclusion of children from school or daycare for five days once the chickenpox rash has developed is too late to prevent exposure of fellow classmates.</p>
<p>“We had so many kids out of school and it was ridiculous,” Dr. MacDonald said in a telephone interview. “Kids were missing school who were well enough to go to gymnastics class. It was just a farce.”</p>
<p>Policies on chickenpox vary greatly across Canada, differing by school board and public health unit.</p>
<p>In Manitoba and Alberta, children are not excluded and can attend school with mild chickenpox as long as they feel well enough to participate normally in all activities. British Columbia's new draft policy – not yet posted on its website – is more ambiguous.</p>
<p>“We are silent on whether a child should be excluded,” said Monika Naus, director of the immunization program at the BC Centre for Disease Control, in a telephone interview. “But we state that if a child is excluded, they should come back in when they are well enough to partake in usual activities and when the lesions have crusted over, which is usually day 5.”</p>
<p>Toronto Public Health has had both experiences: It dropped the exclusion policy a decade ago, but then reinstated the five-day exclusion several years later, in part because of pressure from schools.</p>
<p>“I do agree with what the CPS [Canadian Paediatric Society] is saying, for kids with mild disease there really isn't any point to exclusion,” said Rita Shahin, associate medical officer of health for Toronto Public Health. “It's a lot easier for a school to say ‘five days' because then it's something that's very easy to count as opposed to how many spots does a kid have.”</p>
<p>Dr. Shahin said that once things settle down with H1N1, Toronto Public Health will review its five-day exclusion policy, with one possible option being dropping it altogether for mild cases.</p>
<p>Chickenpox is a highly contagious illness caused by the varicella zoster virus. The vast majority of cases – about 90 per cent – occur before a child turns 12. It is characterized by a rash of raised red blisters that are extremely itchy. Some children have only a few blisters while others can have as many as 500.</p>
<p>Breakthrough chickenpox – cases in which the child has acquired the disease despite vaccination – usually results in milder illnesses, typically defined as those with fewer than 50 spots.</p>
<p>“The reason why the Canadian Paediatric Society thinks that children should not be excluded from school with mild chickenpox is because they are actually contagious for one day before they break out in the rash, so most of the time the other children have been exposed anyway,” said Joan Robinson, a member of the society's infectious diseases and immunization committee. “So then it seems a bit silly to keep them home from school for several days in order to not infect any one when the other children have all been exposed.” She pointed out that most children are vaccinated against the disease.</p>
<p>Those with chickenpox are infectious from two days before the rash appears until roughly five days after, when all the blisters have fully crusted over.</p>
<p>While the vaccine – typically provided to children after their first birthday – is funded by provincial health plans, it is not mandatory. But pediatricians, such as Dr. MacDonald, stress the need for children to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>And, she said, if a physician determines a child is healthy enough to return to the classroom, that should be heard.</p>
<p>“If your doctor says you are ready to go back, you are ready to go back,” Dr. MacDonald said. “It's not fair to the child to be caught in the middle of this.”</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>One dose or two?</p>
<p>Canada offers one shot, the United States offers two. The difference in approach amounts to controlling a disease compared with eradicating it.</p>
<p>Canada's approach</p>
<p>The chickenpox vaccine is typically given after a baby's first birthday but before the child is 15 months old. Despite vaccination, a small percentage of children will catch the disease, usually in its more mild form. The effectiveness of a single shot of vaccine ranges from 70 per cent to 90 per cent.</p>
<p>The National Advisory Committee on Immunization says it is reviewing evidence suggesting that a second dose of vaccine may be necessary for optimal immunity. It is expected to provide a revised statement early in the new year, according to Public Health Agency of Canada spokeswoman Caroline Grondin.</p>
<p>The U.S. approach</p>
<p>Babies get the first dose of vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age, then a booster, usually from ages 4 to 6. But the booster can be administered earlier as long as the interval between the first and second dose is greater than three months, according to recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Games could be postponed due to threat of H1N1</b>
</div><div>Tim Switzer   </div>
<div>The Leader-Post</div>
<div>539 words</div><div>24 November 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>C7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>The University of Regina Cougars women's basketball team's games are expected to go ahead this weekend, but with H1N1 having an effect on universities across the country, most teams know contests could be postponed at a moment's notice.</p>
<p>The Cougars' hoopsters are to play host to the Fraser Valley Cascades on Friday at the Centre for Kinesiology, Health and Sport. The Cascades had last weekend's scheduled games against the Simon Fraser Clan postponed because of UFV players dealing with H1N1.</p>
<p>Given the threat, beginning in October the U of R athletic department made sure Cougars athletes were well-educated on the subject.</p>
<p>"The education route is really not different than what the general public gets, but of course our folks are in an environment that does make them somewhat susceptible given the close contact," said U of R athletic director Dick White. "They're in locker rooms together, they're in buses and planes together. The nature of sport is a fair amount of physical contact."</p>
<p>White said there had been one confirmed case of H1N1 afflicting a U of R athlete, but declined to say who it was or which team was involved. Other teams -- including the men's volleyball team and Rams football team -- have been hit hard by the seasonal flu throughout the fall.</p>
<p>"In a lot of cases now, people are more or less assuming it's H1N1 and we're treating any flu in the same manner," said White.</p>
<p>While teams in Canada West sports have stayed relatively healthy, many teams in Ontario University Athletics (OUA) and Atlantic University Sport (AUS) have had to postpone games over flu concerns -- and not necessarily H1N1.</p>
<p>The only games postponed out west because of flu were the Fraser Valley games this weekend as well as contests between the Saskatchewan Huskies and Lethbridge Pronghorns women's hockey teams on Oct. 30 and 31 because of concerns on the Pronghorns side. The Brandon Bobcats women's basketball team was barely able to field a team Saturday against the Winnipeg Wesmen because several players were down with what was believed to be a seasonal flu.</p>
<p>"We knew early we needed to put in plans," White said when asked about the conference's preparations for outbreaks. "We did put in some protocols for cancellation. Fundamentally, if a team can no longer field a competitive lineup and we don't want to do anything that would spread the flu, we've look at the postponement of games. Our priority is if we can't play, we look at rescheduling. In some cases that's quite feasible. In other cases it's not."</p>
<p>With teams in Canada West entering the final weekend of competition on Friday before the holiday/exam break, it could be that any danger of teams having to postpone more games is over. But athletic directors, players and coaches are not taking anything for granted.</p>
<p>"We're dealing with the same difficulty as everyone: Are we done or not?" said White. "You kind of wonder if the run is done or if there will be more flu come the second half."</p>

<p>The Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region (RQHR) wants the public to know there is enough H1N1 flu vaccine for everyone and there's no need to rush to a clinic today.</p>
<p>"One thing that's really important to remember is that not everybody has to come the very first morning. We will be here for several more weeks," said Joyce Wilson, pandemic mass immunization co-ordinator for the RQHR. "So if you don't want to stand in lineups, don't come first thing (Tuesday) morning."</p>
<p>She said the clinic located at the former Robert Usher Collegiate at 1440-9th Ave. N. opens its doors at 9 a.m. and remains open until 7:45 p.m. each day this week until Saturday.</p>
<p>After weeks when the vaccine was available only to people in special categories, it is available to the general public as of today.</p>
<p>"If you have had a lab-confirmed case of H1N1, then you don't need to come back for a shot -- although it won't hurt to get it. Actually, it will help to boost your immunity," said Wilson. "If you don't know for sure if that's what it is, because there is a seasonal flu, as well, that's going around, then we do recommend that you do come and you have your H1N1 shot."</p>
<p>The RQHR is also hosting a H1N1 flu clinic in the Green and White Room at Mosaic Stadium. She said there are specific days and hours the clinic will be open there.</p>
<p>"It is near some of the North Central areas and we wanted to provide better access for people who may not have good access to an area such as Usher."</p>
<p>She said the clinics will be open for several more weeks.</p>
<p>"It all depends on traffic flow. If we still have a steady stream of people coming through, we will stay open a little longer," said Wilson. "But even after we choose to shut down this site, we will continue to do immunizations until the end of March on an ongoing basis throughout our regular offices."</p>
<p>She said there is a plentiful supply of the vaccine now, despite the slow start.</p>
