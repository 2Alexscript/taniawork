<div id="hd"><b>Extreme change 'not going away'; Challenge often presents opportunity</b>
</div><div>Ray Turchansky   </div>
<div>For Canwest News Service</div>
<div>682 words</div><div>19 December 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>C2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>The common thread among the half-dozen speakers at the recent Economics Society of Northern Alberta conference on recovery was that change is at hand in almost every aspect of our lives.</p>
<p>It may range from farmers raising bison and sheep as significant revenue sources, to cuts in government spending and increases in consumption taxes, to new technologies causing us to embrace solar and nuclear energy plus natural gas as primary power sources.</p>
<p>"We are in a period of extreme change, and it's not going away," said Peter Tertzakian, chief economist of ARC Financial, and author of books A Thousand Barrels a Second and The End of Energy Obesity. "There's always opportunity in change."</p>
<p>Therein lies the warning, and challenge, for investors. Those who seek and recognize future changes in how we live and work can prosper from them.</p>
<p>Tertzakian showed how energy conservation has evolved from an automatic candle snuffer that put out the flame after a candle burned down a certain length, to a box by Cisco Systems that continually adjusts energy needs for lighting, heating and powering machines throughout a building, cutting electricity consumption by 10 to 15 per cent.</p>
<p>During that stretch of history, we used ice blocks for refrigeration until machines were developed to do the job. We burned whale oil for lighting, and when whale stocks depleted we moved the processing "factories" from land onto the whaling ships to reduce oil deterioration. We evolved from heating with coal gas to the use of stranded "nature's gas" when pipeline welding allowed it to be transported great distances.</p>
<p>"The technologies that change the game are going to come from outside the energy complex, much as welding affected the fortunes of coal," said Tertzakian. " <span class="companylink">Google</span>, <span class="companylink">Cisco</span> and IBM are largely in the business of saving energy."</p>
<p>Tertzakian said the problem is that two-thirds of all barrels of oil produced go to transportation, and it isn't until "around $85 a barrel when you start to get substitution, you start to get behavioural change, when people seek alternatives."</p>
<p>"And the free market is the most powerful thing to sort things out, within boundaries. The role of government is to set the boundaries. The most powerful changes have nothing to do with government incentives."</p>
<p>That dovetails with the message from Stewart Hall, an economist with HSBC Securities Canada.</p>
<p>"We need to hand off the public sector spending to the private sector at some point in time," said Hall.</p>
<p>He said there are huge profits to be made from other Canadian resources.</p>
<p>"India is set to import rice for the first time in a long period of time (20 years)," said Hall. "There are areas that are not water-rich, and I'm not talking lakes and rivers, I'm talking water in the ground, aquifers.</p>
<p>"Canada is very well-positioned to take advantage of this, because you can set up a virtual trade of water by exporting grain and rice to areas that are water-deficient. Some argue that the next <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> is going to be agricultural engineering."</p>
<p>Don Brown, the director of economics and competitiveness with Alberta Agriculture, noted the percentage of Canadian household spending on food and non-alcoholic beverages has dropped from 26 per cent in 1945 to 8.8 per cent currently.</p>
<p>He said Canada's share of world wheat trade is declining, beef is facing "one calamity after another," pork is suffering from high feed costs and the H1N1 flu, while</p>
<p>Canadian consumption of poultry isn't rising as fast as in the United States.</p>
<p>The good news is that there's a growing demand for bison, as well as sheep breeding stock and market lambs.</p>
<p>"Never waste a crisis, never waste a disaster," Brown said. "That is a key requirement for attitude change."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Man denied disability award; Top court ruling unanimous; Paralysis caused by unprotected sex called tragic - but not an accident</b>
</div><div>JANICE TIBBETTS   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>616 words</div><div>19 December 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>A man who became paraplegic after contracting herpes from unprotected sex lost a $200,000 disability award yesterday when the Supreme Court sided with his insurance company in a ruling that concluded that his misfortune, while tragic and unexpected, was not an accident.</p>
<p>The unanimous court said that allowing Randolph Gibbens to cash in "would stretch the boundaries of an accident policy beyond the snapping point" by effectively turning it into health insurance for disease sufferers, with lower premiums.</p>
<p>The case, which pitted the <span class="companylink">Co-operators Life Insurance Company</span> against the former high-pressure water blaster, centred on the meaning of the word "accident" in deciding insurance claims.</p>
<p>The ruling overturned two earlier victories for Gibbens in British Columbia courts, which had ruled that he lost the use of his legs by accident because he could not have anticipated it.</p>
<p>Gibbens, who is in his late 40s and lives in the Vancouver suburb of Port Coquitlam, contracted a rare form of genital herpes after having unprotected sex with three women in early 2003. The virus attacked his spine and paralyzed him from his abdomen down.</p>
<p>"I agree with the courts in British Columbia that Mr. Gibbens's paralysis was tragic and unexpected but I do not agree with them that it was caused by 'external, violent and accidental means' within the meaning of the insurance policy," Justice Ian Binnie wrote in the 9-0 decision.</p>
<p>"In the case of Mr. Gibbens we are dealing with a disease transmitted in the ordinary course of having sex."</p>
<p>The B.C. Supreme Court, in siding with Gibbens two years ago, said his paraplegia was an unexpected outcome of having unprotected sex and that his behaviour, while foolish, was a far cry from engaging in "inordinate risk," such as laying down on the centre line of a highway during traffic.</p>
<p>The ruling was upheld in the B.C. Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court, however, said it is not enough that an outcome be unexpected.</p>
<p>"In ordinary speech, 'accident' does not include ailments proceeding from natural causes," Binnie wrote.</p>
<p>"It cannot be correct that passengers sitting in an airliner who catch the SARS virus through the externality of the plane's air circulation system, or riders on a bus who catch 'swine flu' from an infected fellow passenger, or people who contract any number of infectious diseases because of a failure to wash hands in disinfectant, or to smack a circling mosquito, have valid claims under an accident policy."</p>
<p>Guy Collette, Gibbens' lawyer, said the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of accident coverage by asserting that there must be a triggering, unnatural calamity for a claim to succeed.</p>
<p>"The law has changed in my view," said Collette, who secured the earlier court victories by relying on existing case law governing insurance coverage for accidents, including a 2007 Ontario Court of Appeal ruling that sided with a man who became paraplegic after contracting West Nile disease from a mosquito bite.</p>
<p>Collette speculated that Gibbens, under the rules carved out yesterday, would have been successful in the Supreme Court if there had been an unnatural event that ignited the tragedy, such as a broken condom.</p>
<p>The insurance industry had warned the court against siding with Gibbens, arguing that including diseases in accident coverage would have "potentially profound" effects.</p>
<p>"The decision ensures that Canadians will continue to have access to affordable accident coverage," Jodi Skeates, association legal counsel, said yesterday.</p>
<p>"It maintains the status quo by reaffirming the distinction between an accident and a naturally occurring disease."</p>

</p>
<p>Today's shopping centre Santa is jolly and twinkly-eyed, but he also needs to be physically fit, attentive, have toy smarts and be able to say Merry Christmas in several languages. Some Ottawa Santas even know sign language.</p>
<p>Jennifer Andrews is head elf at Calgary-based Santa School, Canada's only training ground for Santa, Mrs. Claus and elves. "Santa is a show-stopper. There's no one bigger in a young child's eyes," Andrews says. "He has the power to make kids feel like they're the most important person in the world. So Santa must have an almost a regal presence and exude that power with a commanding stature, personality and voice."</p>
<p>Nowadays, Santa must also be fit. About 90 per cent of the 7,000 children who visit Santa at Billings Bridge Plaza opt to sit on his knee. The numbers are even higher at St. Laurent Centre. At Carlingwood Shopping Centre, Louis Lacelle, who has been a Santa for 15 years, visits with 70 or 80 children during a three-hour, non-stop shift.</p>
<p>In 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, Santa had a round belly that "shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly." But that poem was written more than 180 years ago. Modern Santas are more likely to carry their weight as muscle, not fat.</p>
<p>Ottawa's Santas keep healthy and fit by being active year-round. After Christmas, retired manager Al "Ho-Ho" Page, who has been Billings Bridge Plaza's Santa for the past 21 years, trades in his sleigh for a school bus. Place d'Orléans Santa Pierre Alberti, a retired public servant and a Santa for 30 years, has logged close to 300,000 kilometres on his 1994 Harley Classic. Carlingwood's Lacelle is a nursing attendant. Both his seasonal and full-time job require patience, communication and listening skills. He is also a drummer and vocalist; like all Santas he loves to entertain.</p>
<p>As healthy as Santa might be, this season he has had to deal with the flu and H1N1. At Carlingwood, for example, Louis Lacelle, a Santa for the past 15 years, regularly sanitizes his hands and puts on clean gloves at the start of his shift. He can go through three, four or more pairs before his day is done. His suit and beard are also sanitized during breaks, as are high contact points such as the arms of his chair. And there are sanitizers for children and parents, too.</p>
<p>But it's not enough for Santa to be physically healthy; he needs mental stamina too. Listening intently and enthusiastically to each child's story and wishes can be draining. Plus children expect Santa to be up on the latest toys such as Zhu Zhu Pets, Dora Links Dolls, Transformers action figures, <span class="companylink">Spin Master Toys</span> Air Hogs Laser Zero Gravity remote control car, and many, many more.</p>
<p>Santa stays on top of his game with the help of his elves, but he must also do his own homework. Santa Al Page encourages schoolchildren to bring their toys on the bus so he can learn from them. Santa Louis Lacelle, now a grandfather, has a new source for expert information. Santa Pierre Alberti, like many Santas, is cyber-savvy and relies on the Internet. If he is stumped by a child's request he encourages the child to talk more about that particular toy or wish -- Santa is human, after all. Kids appreciate that he's interested and he will remember next time.</p>
<p>Santa also has to know how to respond to tricky questions, such as requests to bring separated parents back together or to help find a job for a parent.</p>
<p>And he has to be prepared for visits from teens who chat about problems with parents or boyfriends, or who ask him to bring peace to the world. There are also whispered requests from grown-ups to find a spouse a job or to make a relationship work.</p>
<p>Above all, Santa must never make promises. He must be a good listener, appreciate each situation and its impact on the child.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, most Santas speak English and French; some know sign language. At Billings Bridge, parents who visited Santa Al when they were kids are now bringing their own children to see him. Santa Al, who speaks English and French, can also wish children Merry Christmas in 14 other languages.</p>
<p>Many Ottawa Santas have noticed that their visitors are from all ethnic backgrounds and religions.</p>
<p>"Santa is seen as a cultural figure, not a religious one. Santa is part of our culture and people want to share in the spirit of the season," Santa Al says. Being Santa is a privilege, he adds. And that is definitely something to ho-ho-ho about.</p>
<p>WHAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT SANTA</p>
<p>When it comes to Santa's conduct, Jennifer Andrews, head elf at the Calgary-based Santa School, does not have a wish list. She has a six-point "no excuses'' list of expectations every Santa must meet.</p>
<p>When wearing his red suit, Santa must:</p>
<p>- Be neat and well-dressed.</p>
<p>- Be friendly, outgoing and good-humoured.</p>
<p>- Make children feel good about themselves and their visit with Santa -- without ever making promises.</p>
<p>- Remain in character throughout any event or shift. This includes no smoking, even while on a break. Same goes for holiday spirits.</p>
<p>- Practise "gloves" at first sight. Santa's hands should be visible at all times.</p>
<p>- Pass a police record check.</p>
<p>- Sitting on Santa's knee is no longer a given. At Rideau Centre and Place d'Orléans , Santa's chair is large and low to the ground, making it easy for children to sit safely next to him, or on his knee. St. Laurent Centre has a sofa large enough for a family. At Billings Bridge, kids sit on Santa's knee, alongside him in his chair, or on a small stool. At Carlingwood, children are guided into a comfy sleigh with its own GPS -- Gift Positioning System.</p>

<p>Kids at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario were visited by not one, but 20 Santas on Tuesday when Ottawa Senator players arrived dressed in red, singing Jingle Bells and carrying presents.</p>
<p>Every year, the Senators visit CHEO to brighten the moods of children and their families who may have to spend Christmas in hospital.</p>
<p>"Being a father myself, I'm thankful that there are facilities like this around," said Ottawa Senator Chris Neil.</p>
<p>"It's always nice to put smiles on the faces, especially at a time where some of them may not be able to get home for Christmas," said centre Mike Fisher. "We're just glad to be able to help out any way we can."</p>
<p>Team captain Daniel Alfredsson has made countless visits to CHEO over the years, and said there are many familiar faces.</p>
<p>"A lot of these kids are here long-term and times are tough for them, but they handle it extremely well and it's humbling to see how they face adversity," he said.</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday, Senator goaltender Pascal Leclaire and defenceman Alexandre Picard visited kids at the pediatric department at l'Hopital de Gatineau.</p>
<p>Whether or not the hospital visits would take place this year had been uncertain after Senators management announced last month that public appearances by players would be suspended until all had received the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Brian Morris, director of communications for the club, would not comment on whether or not the players who visited the hospital had been vaccinated, but did say the shot had been offered to all of them. "The decision to get the vaccine was a personal one, and not mandatory," he said.</p>
<p>Judging by the smiles on faces, the children were thrilled the event went ahead.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Travel safe; Be aware of health risks before embarking on a foreign holiday</b>
</div><div>Rosemary McCracken   </div>

</p>
<p>Planning a winter vacation in the sun? Now is the time to visit a travel medical clinic to help you stay healthy, both on your holiday and after your return.</p>
<p>"Travel agents are now advising clients to visit travel clinics before they leave home," says Coralie Belman, national certification manager with the Canadian Institute of Travel Counsellors in Toronto. "The staff will have up-to-date, detailed information about international travel destinations, and the health risks travellers may encounter. With the popularity of Internet bookings, some travellers aren't hearing about health hazards outside Canada."</p>
<p>And don't put off your visit until the day before you leave. Dr. Carmen Poirier at Foothills Health Consultants, a medical travel clinic in Calgary, says travellers should visit a travel clinic as soon as they've decided on their destination. They may need to start vaccinations as early as three months before departure because some require several shots that have to be spaced out.</p>
<p>"If you show up the week before your trip, we may not be able to do much for you," she says.</p>
<p>Travellers can also check out Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada's website for an overview of what immunization is required to enter individual countries.</p>
<p>A list of travel clinics across Canada can be found on the Public Health Agency of Canada's website. Clinics usually charge a consultation fee, but the vaccines may be covered by provincial health plans or private medical plans.</p>
<p>You'll need to tell the health-care professional about the activities you'll be doing on your vacation, Poirier says. If you spend your holiday on the beach at your resort, your health risks may be considerably lower than if you're exploring tropical rainforests and caves.</p>
<p>Poirier says parts of the Dominican Republic are currently at risk for malaria, a mosquito-borne infectious disease widespread in tropical regions. Malaria can be prevented by oral prescription medicine, starting a week or two before departure.</p>
<p>Travellers to Mexican resorts and major cities are not currently at risk from malaria (it is found in parts of the country less often visited by travellers, however) but they should be immunized for hepatitis A, which is contracted from contaminated food and water, and for hepatitis B, contracted from contaminated blood and body fluids.</p>
<p>"Hepatitis A requires two vaccinations, and hepatitis B requires three. You'll need at least two weeks after the last shot for them to be effective," Poirier says. "They're good for 15 to 20 years, possibly longer."</p>
<p>And, depending where you're heading in the Caribbean, Central America or Mexico, you may also require immunization against:</p>
<p>- Rabies. "But we only recommend shots if you'll be caving or with animals," Poirier says.</p>
<p>- Tetanus and diphtheria. "Both require boosters every 10 years," she says.</p>
<p>- Red measles. "If you were born in 1970 or later, and never had red measles, you'll need a booster," she adds.</p>
<p>- Pneumonia. "People age 65 and older should be vaccinated against pneumonia."</p>
<p>Immunization against swine flu (H1N1) is not currently required at any international travel destination, "but I wouldn't advise travelling without it," Poirier says.</p>
<p>Some countries, however, have implemented airport screening for swine flu. Mary Lendway, co-ordinator of the tourism management program at Humber Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning in Toronto, advises being vaccinated for H1N1 at least two weeks before departure, and carrying a doctor's letter saying that you've been inoculated.</p>
<p>"That way, if you have some symptoms when you arrive, you'll have proof of vaccination," she says.</p>
<p>Travellers' diarrhea, a common tropical vacation malady, can be greatly minimized by the oral vaccine Dukoral, Poirier says. The first dose is taken two weeks before departure, followed by a second a week later.</p>
<p>But the biggest threats are on the roads in the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico. "Traffic accidents are the No. 1 killers of tourists in these countries," Poirier says. "In many areas, vehicles are not equipped with seatbelts, and the roads are crazy."</p>
<p>In some places, an injured person who requires a blood transfusion may be at risk from contaminated blood, Poirier adds.</p>
<p>Travellers who are injured abroad should immediately call the emergency number provided by their travel health insurer, Belman says. "You'll be directed to the appropriate hospital and a reputable doctor. Don't try to find a clinic on your own. Not all health facilities in developing countries are up to Canadian standards."</p>
<p>That means keeping your insurer's emergency number with you at all times, and alerting your travel companion of the need to call it if you're unable to do so.</p>
<p>Travel insurance, Belman stresses, is one of the most important things to pack on any trip outside Canada. Treatment in foreign hospitals can run to thousands of dollars a day. Travel health insurance will cover these bills, as well as air evacuation back to Canada.</p>
<p>But, when purchasing travel insurance, it's critical to disclose existing medical conditions. If, for example, you suffer a heart attack or a stroke abroad, the insurer will check with your family doctor. If it learns you had a heart condition you didn't disclose, it can refuse to cover your medical expenses.</p>
<p>"And make sure your insurance is tailored to the activities you'll be doing on your trip," Poirier adds. "Some policies won't cover injuries sustained in extreme sports."</p>
<p>Common sense can reduce your health risks abroad. "Standards of cleanliness may not be what they are in Canada," Belman says. "Look carefully at an establishment before you have a manicure, pedicure, facial or hair treatment. The spa at a five-star hotel, however, will probably be fine."</p>
<p>Watch where you're walking in bare feet. "There may be sting rays or glass on the beach," she adds.</p>
<p>And be careful about what you eat and drink, Belman says. "You may not be drinking the local water, but are you brushing your teeth with it? Is it being used to wash fruit and vegetables on the menu? Peel your fruit and opt for cooked vegetables.</p>
<p>"And avoid eating and drinking alcohol to excess, especially at all-inclusive resorts."</p>
<p>Belman also advises travelling with your own bug repellent: "Levels of DEET may be a lot higher in other countries.</p>
<p>"And bring along your own non-prescription medications," she adds. "Strengths may differ abroad. And, if they're not in English, you may not be able to read the instructions."</p>
<p>Pack a small container of antibiotic hand gel, she suggests, and use it on your hands before eating or touching your face.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 vaccination was a waste of money</b>
</div><div>Frank Kuschnereit   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>

</p>
<p>Re: The extraordinary power of vaccines, Dec. 17.</p>
<p>I was concerned at columnist Elizabeth Payne's declaration that "...the H1N1 vaccine campaign has been, and continues to be, a success."</p>
<p>She describes other successful vaccination campaigns and, in effect, compares the success of the H1N1 flu program with the program to eradicate polio in Canada. H1N1 was never as great a threat as polio, one of the greatest scourges of the 20th century. Polio killed one-third of those who contracted it and required a national program over many years to eradicate it in Canada.</p>
<p>H1N1 on the other hand is already recognized as being the mildest pandemic on record. The Ottawa-Hull region has a population of one million and H1N1 contributed to the deaths of seven people.</p>
<p>Second, the H1N1 vaccination program was not a success. The H1N1 wave started in April and the second wave peaked on Oct. 31. Since the vaccinations only started in earnest in mid-October and it takes 10 to 20 days for the immunity to fully develop, there is no way anyone can credit the vaccine with the low number of fatalities.</p>
<p>One can also not say that the low mortality rate could not have been predicted as our experiences mirrored those who had already gone through their flu season in the southern hemisphere such as Australia.</p>
<p>The H1N1 program has been a failure and a waste of not only money but also the time of thousands of health professionals who otherwise could have being carrying out more productive duties.</p>
<p>I agree that mass vaccination programs are a powerful weapon against major diseases but they are expensive and should be used in only the most dire circumstances as the health system does not have unlimited resources. The total spent in Canada on the H1N1 program will be more than $2 billion with half of the purchased vaccines left unused.</p>
<p>Does it seem worth it now when some Ontario hospitals may close beds and lay off staff due to funding shortfalls? Yes, H1N1 will likely contribute to many fatalities as predicted but not directly. Most of the deaths will likely be ones that could have been saved if all that money had been put to better use in the general health system rather than lining the pockets of the drug companies.</p>
<p>In the future we should weigh the costs and alternatives prior to embarking on mass vaccination programs.</p>

</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Google</span> doesn't make your coffee in the morning, but it's there waiting to do just about everything else you need.</p>
<p>It delivers a personalized news service, synchronizes your schedules, shares and delivers data, lets you create your own broadcasting channel through <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, build websites, blog, chat around the world, find out where you're going and virtually cruise neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>Even as I write this, Vancouver's Lisa Mighton of Latitude Media has pointed to an online service that lets me decorate my home for the holidays -- not in real life but in <span class="companylink">Google</span> Street View so that in case any visitors are checking my address, they can see it's ready to party.</p>
<p>Just a little more than 12 years ago, <span class="companylink">Google</span> was still in a garage. Fifteen years ago, its founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin met for the first time.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Google</span>'s world encompasses a lot, but it's only part of a shift that has seen the massive network that is the Internet turned into an electronic valet.</p>
<p>P.G. Wodehouse's Bertie Wooster had Jeeves to get him out of all kinds of scrapes and keep him well-informed. While the online service of the same name has retired, in fact Web 2.0 and now 3.0 is giving all of us a personal Jeeves to keep abreast of happenings, get out of sticky situations and do much of the work we used to have to do ourselves.</p>
<p>They're our personal translators, our office in the clouds, they're mobile -- we carry them in our pockets when we go out -- and they perform far beyond the simple search that marked the earlier days of the online world.</p>
<p>We are active participants, contributing to vast databases.</p>
<p>It can be overwhelming. The web brought the world to our fingertips -- try sorting out the world; it's not easy. It's an information overload and one that can be smothering, as Marc Stoiber, founder of Change Advertising, suggested in a controversial and thought-provoking talk at the recent TEDxVancouver.</p>
<p>The world needs people who can focus and we are becoming increasingly distracted, Stoiber said.</p>
<p>"We are throwing away the message and just going for the communication method ... we are drinking from this firehose of communication," he said.</p>
<p>It's a firehose that has some nozzles and companies constantly trying to find better ways to manage it.</p>
<p>"The average user of the web is overwhelmed; there are too many inputs, too many outputs and nothing that really consolidates your value," said David Vogt, founder and chief executive officer of Gleanr, which recently launched an online service, Gleanr.com, to help users make sense of and share the information they collect.</p>
<p>"From a plumbing perspective Gleanr takes all your feeds and any channels you view and allows you to put them in one spot," said Vogt. "Anytime you come across an idea, or content and you decide it's important, you can drop it into this channel."</p>
<p>Personalizing your online world is the new mantra and one delivered by a variety of technologies and ideas.</p>
<p>And while it has become a part of many of our lives, it's hard to remember that barely three short years ago, <span class="companylink">YouTube.ca</span> was not even around.</p>
<p>It went "from zero to about 17 million users in a month in Canada," said <span class="companylink">Google</span> industry manager Eric Morris. "It is all of that video footage from professional to user-generated content.</p>
<p>"It has given all of us the ability to become not just consumers of content but creators of content. All of us can now be publishers, we can be TV producers."</p>
<p><span class="companylink">YouTube</span> is the No. 2 search engine in Canada behind <span class="companylink">Google</span>, which wouldn't be surprising except if you think back 10 years when we were still carrying around clunky video cameras to record our most memorable moments. Getting them onto our computers was enough of a challenge, let alone adding full movie features that can make our summer vacation look like it had Peter Jackson in the director's chair.</p>
<p>It's also difficult to remember that <span class="companylink">Google</span> not long ago celebrated its first decade and when it started, we thought it simply amazing that we could access information from an index that was updated once a month.</p>
<p>"When <span class="companylink">Google</span> started 10 years ago, you were only able to search web pages and they were updated in the index once a month; it was referred to as the <span class="companylink">Google</span> dance," said Morris. "Now websites are updated in minutes, sometimes seconds."</p>
<p>If the rate of change has been staggering, it is showing no signs of slowing. If anything, it has speeded up over the past 10 years and we can expect the pace to only increase.</p>
<p>"We now carry computers with us -- not only in the form of the mini notebooks known as net-books but in our phones and other mobile devices. And our information isn't locked away in filing cabinets, or even on our computers; it now goes into the cloud, essentially a personal hard drive cum computer that holds all your content, other data and any applications you may need to use."</p>
<p>That big box computer sitting under your desk is going to be a doorstop, if it isn't already.</p>
<p>"These are innovations that have taken place in a very, very short period of time, really in the last couple of years," said Morris. "There have been significant changes in computing, in what is available online."</p>
<p>Coming up?</p>
<p>Only more mobility and accessibility are on the horizon. Mobile applications for the iPhone, BlackBerry and <span class="companylink">Google</span> Android phones are flooding the market, many free or very low cost. Location-based services deliver what you need, where you need it, no longer assuming computer users are sitting in their office or their living rooms.</p>
<p>And as the barriers of distance have disappeared, so too have the barriers of language, with translation now a norm.</p>
<p>As the song says, "getting to know you, getting to know all about you," is the mark of current search engine technology. Another British Columbia company, the University of B.C. spinoff Worio, has launched what it calls its web scale discovery engine -- a search engine in which personalization and contextual search replace simply keyword searches.</p>
<p>"What Worio will do is learn what topics I am interested in and sift through the net and push me the information when something happens on one of those topics," said Ali Davar, chief executive officer of the startup.</p>
<p>While there are those who have grown up on <span class="companylink">Google</span> and others who find it so ubiquitous that "<span class="companylink">Google</span>" has become a verb, there are computer users who can't figure out the simplest of searches.</p>
<p>For them, there's a tongue-in-cheek answer from "let me <span class="companylink">Google</span> that for you," a site you can use when your mother-in-law, neighbour or can't-be-bothered companion asks where to find something.</p>
<p>You enter the search term and it turns up a link that you can copy and send to your search-challenged contact.</p>
<p>A check of <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s recently launched Dashboard shows how pervasive <span class="companylink">Google</span> has become in my life. It's a mini bio that summarizes the many accounts and identities that I trail through the online world.</p>

<p>iewpoint: Prince George Citizen</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with professional wrestling's make-believe world that after much phoney posturing, the House of Commons voted 192 to 32 in favour of allowing B.C. and Ontario to harmonize their provincial sales tax with the GST.</p>
<p>Liberal Leader Professor Ignatieff, while initially attacking the harmonized sales tax, calling it the "Harper Sales Tax," quickly reverted to the politician's favourite habit of sucking and blowing at the same time and supported the motion.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that a recent poll had 82 per cent of British Columbians opposed to the HST, with 56 per cent believing it will actually hurt the province, the peek-a-boo premier (last seen in Prince George in May) Gordon Campbell and his local MLAs will ram it through in July. This guy is about as welcome in these parts as a case of H1N1.</p>
<p>So come July, while you're at the cabin trying to recover from the worst recession since the Dirty '30s, the Liberals will be picking your pocket with the HST and a 300 per cent increase in the carbon tax as the gift that keeps on giving every time you fill up.</p>
<p>Reacting to voter outrage in Ontario, the Liberal government responded with a series of exemptions, income tax cuts, credits and rebates they say will actually cost the province $2.3 billion over the next four years.</p>
<p>Yet in B.C., where the Liberals are trying to convince us the tax isn't just a cash grab, or more likely an Olympic Tax to pay for Campbell's legacy bash, they have offered little in the way of exemptions.</p>
<p>The restaurant sector alone will be hit with up to $700 million in new taxes in an industry accustomed to paper-thin margins and employees who need tips to survive.</p>
<p>If HST cheerleader MLA Pat Bell has his way, come July we'll all be eating burgers at one of his Wendy's restaurants since that's all we'll be able to afford.</p>
<p>Pat should remember what happened to Marie Antoinette, when, upon being told the peasants had no bread to eat, remarked, "qu'ils mangent de la brioche" (let them eat cake).</p>
<p>So, as the countdown to the July implementation approaches, don't be fooled by the rhetoric about job creation and all the wonderful things the HST will do for the forest sector. What this really amounts to is a tax grab by a government that has run out of ideas, and whose arrogance, like Antoinette's, knows no bounds.</p>
<p>One can only hope that the electorate's memory also knows no bounds come 2013.</p>

<p>JUSTICE REPORTER</p>
<p>It was unrealistic to award $200,000 to a Vancouver man paralyzed after a series of medical calamities arose after having unprotected sex, the Supreme Court of Canada said yesterday.</p>
<p>In a ruling that provided great relief for nervous insurers, the court retracted the court award and stressed the importance of realism in assessing accidental injuries.</p>
<p>A 9-0 majority said that there is no doubt that the plaintiff, Randolph Charles Gibbens, lost the use of his lower body unexpectedly, but that was not the same as an accident.</p>
<p>Mr. Gibbens fell gravely ill in early 2003, shortly after he had unprotected sex with three women and acquired genital herpes.</p>
<p>He was diagnosed with transverse myelitis, a rare complication of herpes that causes inflammation of the spinal cord.</p>
<p>He was soon totally paralyzed from his mid-abdomen down.</p>
<p>The Court said that, although Mr. Gibbens did not actually know that any of the women had genital herpes, he knew that having unprotected sex could result in contracting a sexually transmitted disease. Patricia Jackson, a lawyer who represented the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association in the case, said yesterday that the decision is important to insurers because the original $200,000 award “would have altered decades of established case law and vastly broadened the scope of existing accident insurance policies.</p>
<p>“The Court has provided a welcome confirmation that there is an important distinction between an accident and a naturally occurring disease or bodily infirmity,” Ms. Jackson said.</p>
<p>“It is not an accident when a person suffers the natural effects of a disease, however unexpected, such as when a person acquires an easily transmissible disease such as the swine flu or SARS.”</p>
<p>Under Mr. Gibbens group insurance policy, <span class="companylink">Co-operators Life Insurance Co</span>. provided coverage for losses sustained “as a direct result of a critical disease or resulting directly and independently of all other causes from bodily injuries occasioned solely through external, violent and accidental means.”</p>
<p>A B.C. Supreme Court judge ruled that Mr. Gibbens's paraplegia qualified as a “bodily injury occasioned solely through external, violent and accidental means.” His decision was upheld by the B.C. Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>“Accident insurance is not comprehensive health insurance,” Mr. Justice Ian Binnie said yesterday.</p>
<p>He said that insurance policies must not be subject to exotic interpretations that depart from what an insured person and his insurer could reasonably have contemplated.</p>
<p>“The word ‘accident' is an ordinary word to be interpreted in ordinary language as it would be understood by the average person applying for insurance,” Judge Binnie said.</p>
<p>He noted that Mr. Gibbens' policy specifically provided coverage against a number of “critical diseases,” but transverse myelitis was not listed among them.</p>
<p>Judge Binnie reasoned that a person who suffers a stroke and dies while watching television is the victim of an unexpected tragedy – but not an accident.</p>
<p>“Otherwise, every bad happening, natural or unnatural, whether caused by disease in the ordinary course of events or otherwise, would be classified as an accident,” Judge Binnie said. “The tragedy is totally unexpected. Yet, there is no accident involved in any ordinary manner of speech.”</p>

</p>
<p>11But without a binding agreement in Copenhagen and Canada's green reputation in tatters, it's time to take the next few baby steps.</p>
<p>In the build-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference, there was chatter that, for all our noble intentions, individual actions will never be enough to forestall catastrophic global warming. What's needed is a coordinated government crackdown on polluters.</p>
<p>But, according to Statistics Canada, direct and indirect household emissions account for 46 per cent of Canada's total greenhouse gas output, a fact noted by proponents of individual action.</p>
<p>"We need both streams complimenting each other," said Adria Vasil, author of Ecoholic Home and a green columnist for Toronto's Now Magazine. "We need government clamping down on big emitters, but we also need to clamp down on ourselves."</p>
<p>If lobbying for a new wind farm or a continent-wide cap and trade system is beyond your ken, and you're not quite ready to spend $15,000 installing a geothermal heat system, here are four simple things you can do in 2010 that don't require endless trips to Rona, a weekend of work or a bajillion dollars.</p>
<p>UNPLUG EVERYTHING</p>
<p>Your cable set-top box can suck up more power than your fridge, even when you're not watching television. Startling, eh?</p>
<p>It's called phantom load -- the power drawn by household gadgets even when you think they're turned off. That's pretty much everything that can be turned on with a remote or that has an internal clock. And it's your pile of cell phone chargers, Ipod chargers, battery chargers and laptop cords that leach power constantly if they're plugged in. It's also video game consoles like the Wii and Xbox. Some of those consume 185 watts of power when they're just junked up under the TV.</p>
<p>Phantom load accounts for between five and 10 per cent of all the power used by the average household, says Tracy Moroz, <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>'s residential programs marketing specialist.</p>
<p>Granted, Manitoba's power is pretty green since it's produced by water not coal or natural gas. But because the province's power rates are so cheap, Manitobans aren't great at conservation. The more power Manitobans save, the more green power is available for export, which offsets the need for coal or natural gas plants in the United States.</p>
<p>Moroz has a list of easy to-dos that will actually save you money.</p>
<p>Walk around the house and unplug every charger, appliance and electronic gadget that's not in frequent use.</p>
<p>Next time you buy a new appliance, don't just look for the Energy Star rating but also ask yourself whether you need all the bells and whistles like timers and remote controls. Most kitchens suffer from digital clock overkill -- there's one on the stove, the microwave and the coffee maker. Keeping appliances simple saves phantom power.</p>
<p>Get yourself some power bars. It's annoying to rustle around behind the television looking for the dusty plug every time you want to watch Entertainment Tonight, so the best thing to do is plug all your TV gadgets into a power bar that's easy to switch on and off. Same with computers and printers that don't get used all the time.</p>
<p>Set top boxes are a lingering puzzle. Unplugging them usually means losing all your channel preferences. <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> and other power companies are working with manufacturers and cable companies on set top boxes that could one day use just one watt of power instead of the 45 watts some of them suck right now.</p>
<p>BE A SEMI-VEGETARIAN</p>
<p>If the 100-mile diet is out because you just can't get through a Winnipeg winter without coffee, chocolate and wine, there are still tons of ways to eat more sustainably.</p>
<p>A vegetarian diet is ideal, but Vasil says even reducing the amount of meat you eat -- think Meatless Mondays and Tofu Tuesdays -- can make a difference.</p>
<p>Eating less beef is a start. Manitoba's hog farmers, often criticized for huge factory farms and stinky sewage lagoons, will be glad to hear that pork has about a quarter the carbon footprint of beef, largely because of the methane produced by cow farts and the fertilizer needed for grazing.</p>
<p>Even better is free-range chicken, and even better than that is supporting small, local organic producers, many of whom sell their products at local independent butchers.</p>
<p>"We just ordered a quarter of a bison and a large local turkey for our Christmas dinner," said Kreesta Doucette, executive director of Food Matters Manitoba. "If you have the time, connect with a local farmer."</p>
<p>Same with vegetables. Try to buy what's in season locally instead of vegetables trucked in from afar.</p>
<p>"See if it's made in Manitoba and if it doesn't say, ask," said Doucette.</p>
<p>But Vasil points out one exception to the "buy local" mantra. Greenhouses suck up incredible amounts of energy, so the organic tomato trucked up from Mexico might actually be a greener bet than one grown in a greenhouse.</p>
<p>TAKE THE BUS ONCE A WEEK</p>
<p>Winnipeggers love to complain about the transit system. The buses are old, the routes into far-flung suburbs are spotty, there's no rapid transit system and someone with H1N1 might cough on you.</p>
<p>But experts say taking public transit or biking to work is the single best thing you can do for the environment.</p>
<p>If you suck it up, put on your longjohns, pop on your Ipod and take the bus just one day a week, you could be saving at least 123 kilograms of greenhouse gas emissions a year.</p>
<p>According to Statistics Canada, the average commute in Winnipeg is 6.1 kilometres. Even if you left your very fuel efficient 2009 Toyota Corolla at home once a week, you would still save about 2.45 kilograms of CO2 emissions a day, according to the U.S. Federal Transit Administration's carbon calculator.</p>
<p>That would also save you about $35 a year in gas, which would help offset the cost of bus fare.</p>
<p>PURGE THE PACKAGING</p>
<p>Everyone who has tried to break into a new batch of razors or batteries has cursed the layers and layers of hard plastic packaging.</p>
<p>Vasil suggests making a grand statement by leaving the bulky packaging at the grocery store till when you check out or mailing it to politicians. If you're too shy to do that, try this:</p>
<p>Steer-clear of prewashed veggies like the tubs of lettuce or the bags of salad. Veggies from the shelf are greener and cheaper, especially if you can get away without using one of those flimsy plastic bags.</p>
<p>Do it <span class="companylink">Costco</span>-style, if you can. Buy a huge tub of peanut butter or one mega-box of cereal instead of lots of smaller ones. But make sure the bulk versions really do have less packaging. There's nothing worse than realizing each of the soaps in your four-pack comes in its own box, wrapped together in paper and then plastic shrink-wrapped. And, when buying big plastic containers, make sure they have the recycling triangle stamped on the bottom so they can go in the Blue Box.</p>
<p>Next time you go to Rae and Jerry's, bring your own <span class="companylink">Tupperware</span> for the leftover onion rings instead of taking the disposable containers. As an experiment, Vasil once sent an intern to all the big fast-food joints to test whether they'd use the interns plastic containers for take-out.</p>
<p>"None of them flinched," said Vasil. "They just said 'OK' and filled it up."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>High anxiety: What we can learn from our year of fear</b>

</p>
<p>Were we right to panic?</p>
<p>Our most basic emotions were put on permanent amber alert throughout the past year, as crisis mode threatened to turn into a way of life. Scary phrases such as economic meltdown, global pandemic and environmental catastrophe described our daily status quo, and helpless anxiety became a reasonable response to the litany of terrors beyond our immediate control.</p>
<p>You'd be a fool not to have got all worked up in 2009 – an annus horribilis that was determined to blend the worst of the Great Depression, the 1918 influenza epidemic and the biblical Apocalypse into one impoverished, disease-ridden, Earth-destroying package. Or so we were told by the solemn-faced experts, media rabble-rousers and all-knowing prophets who were competing to get their warnings into our easily distracted heads.</p>
<p>“It was like an escalation of people shouting loudly,” says Margaret MacMillan, the Warden of St. Antony's College, Oxford, and author of The Uses and Abuses of History. “Everyone's communicating in big, blaring headlines, because if they don't make their message apocalyptic, the people they're trying to alert aren't going to pay attention.”</p>
<p>They caught our attention, no question about it. But to what end? As the year draws to a close with financial recovery in the air, the swine-flu hysteria a fading memory and the Copenhagen climate-change talks sputtering along without too much Judgment Day urgency, things don't seem quite so horrific. Call it confidence or complacency or the calm before the storm, but the panic response seems to have been switched off, just in time for shopping season.</p>
<p>Non-stop fear will wear anyone out, and the human brain can function on high alert for only so long before it shifts to either rational decision-making or apathetic detachment. But since the worst didn't happen as expected, did we really need to go through all that anxiety in order to achieve our current time-out?</p>
<p>“Panic is debilitating,” says Anne Golden, the president of the Conference Board of Canada. And she should know. In July, 2008, as warnings of a coming economic collapse grew louder, Ms. Golden wrote a realistic assessment of the Canadian economy that ended with the words “there is no need to panic.”</p>
<p>Fear destroys finance, and Ms. Golden's response was to tell Canadians, for their own good, to get a grip. But clearly things turned out otherwise: “Something happened to public confidence, people lost their footing and fears became bottomless. And that's when legitimate, responsible concern turns into panic.”</p>
<p>In the public sphere, panic is often used as an instant motivator, a method of forcing through cuts that people would resist in less urgent times or overcoming partisan differences among politicians in favour of a common cause.</p>
<p>But Ms. Golden is skeptical that all the rapid emotional upheaval necessarily served a greater good, if only because it faded so fast. “I'm afraid we're losing the window of opportunity to improve the financial regulators or deal with the issues of compensation and greed,” she says.</p>
<p>Renewed optimism, however unjustified and however one-sided the profiteering, can do that sort of thing. It's as if we just couldn't sustain the pessimism necessary to remake a flawed economy, that frugality was a momentary posture rather than the key to a better life.</p>
<p>Our ancestors could withstand a decade-long depression with a long-suffering stoicism, but we're just not a Dirty Thirties kind of generation: We require an accelerated arc in our disasters, a quick collapse and rapid recovery that suits our short attention spans.</p>
<p>“These crises never get properly resolved,” says Irvin Wolkoff, a Toronto psychiatrist. “If we can't sort them out in days or months, it becomes intolerable and insufferable.”</p>
<p>For Dr. Wolkoff, the panic that has become a familiar part of our lives is a kind of unthinking excitement we willingly embrace – not as a means to solving a problem but more as an emotional high that allows us to sidestep responsibility. “The foundation myth for our society has become the Chicken Little, sky-is-falling routine. All we have to be is ignorant, easily excitable and anxious, and then we're allowed to say, ‘I give up, it's all too confusing.' And so we forfeit our sovereignty to corporations and political types.”</p>
<p>For Dr. MacMillan, the modern Age of Anxiety began shortly after the end of the Cold War. “There was a widespread feeling of relief that suddenly we'd seen the triumph of democracy and were ready to claim the peace dividend. And then Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, Yugoslavia started falling apart, and we became rapidly disillusioned.”</p>
<p>Within a few years, anxiety was widespread and large-scale fears could be easily accessed – how else to explain the way the arrival of a new millennium came to be characterized in doomsday language more appropriate to the Dark Ages?</p>
<p>Public officials now know how to play to this readily available panic response, and sometimes this can be justified as a legitimate way of harnessing human emotion – protecting the world against a global pandemic, for example. So when Margaret Chan, the director-general of the World Health Organization, raised the alert level on the H1N1 outbreak in April, she chose highly charged language that now sounds grossly disproportionate.</p>
<p>“All countries should immediately now activate their pandemic preparedness plans,” she said. “Countries should remain on high alert for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia. This is an opportunity for global solidarity as we look for responses and solutions that benefit all countries, all of humanity. After all, it really is all of humanity that is under threat during a pandemic.”</p>
<p>If this doesn't sound like the end of the world as we know it, then what does? Never mind that it comes with the implied reassurance that we are in good hands, provided we pay full attention – at some point, this kind of high-alert death threat became normalized as a health precaution.</p>
<p>“It's understandable with a pandemic,” says Leonard Mlodinow, author of The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives. “The blame you get if you cry wolf and nothing happens is much less than if you keep quiet and all hell breaks loose.”</p>
<p>Crying wolf, as even small children know from their scary bedtime stories, doesn't work well in the long run – how often can you leave the world's population panic-stricken and still hope to mobilize their worst fears one more time?</p>
<p>“Ultimately people lose confidence in those who are there to warn them,” says Richard Schabas, medical officer of health for Hastings and Prince Edward counties in Ontario. “With public health, credibility is our greatest asset, and the shrill warnings with swine flu have damaged our credibility when people can see it's not been a big problem.”</p>
<p>But even skeptics have to pass through a panicky state in order to achieve their hard-won wisdom – sizing up the threat to all humanity, monitoring local illnesses and deaths, looking at the vulnerable among us, calculating the odds that the panic-mongers' rhetoric might finally be appropriate to the gravity of the situation. And with a pandemic, as with an economic meltdown, there's always a next time, or so we've been told: The emotional wounds are there and ready to be reopened.</p>
<p>“These feelings are very powerful and can play out for decades,” says Paul Slovic of Decision Research, an Oregon-based company that studies the role of human judgment in determining risk. “The sense of vulnerability is seared into our brains.”</p>
<p>So even if you're ready to distance yourself from 2009's anxieties – whether you're currently in denial from the economic realities and need to keep Dubai's troubles at arm's length for a few more weeks, or feel like a sucker for listening to WHO yet again or just can't make room in your crowded emotional life for all of climate-change's conundrums – panic's scars won't disappear so easily.</p>
<p>Evolution gave us a panic response for a good reason – but what works for dealing with physical danger is a lot less helpful when it comes to measuring the risks of modern life. Yet the anxieties we feel may be a sign of human liberation in their own strange and worrisome way.</p>
<p>“It's part of living in a secular age,” Dr. MacMillan says. “If you don't have faith, it makes this world more frightening and more difficult to explain.”</p>
<p>Gods comfort people, assume full responsibility and hold out the promise of rewards in the next world while minimizing the miseries of this one. It's very calming, if that's what you want. But for those of us who cling to the values of this messy world, fear is never going to be far away.</p>
<p>As a survival instinct, a sign that you're still alive and kicking, it's highly potent – but the whole point of fear is to keep you going until the rational, problem-solving side of your brain kicks in.</p>
<p>When it comes to resolving the panic attacks of 2009, that's where we still have some hard work to do.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Anti Clause passes on the joys of the season</b>
</div><div>Cam Fuller   </div>
<div>The StarPhoenix</div>
<div>788 words</div><div>19 December 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>E6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>The Christmas-is-Complicated Conspiracy wants you to think that you can't get through the holidays without an avalanche of advice. They're offering impressionable consumers time-saving and money-saving survival tips such as "Eat slowly until you are satisfied, not stuffed." Yes, one supposes that would be the reasonable thing to do. The trouble is that Christmas is the most unreasonable time of the year. Exhibit A: There is a tree in my house that wasn't there last week.</p>
<p>And yet the tips continue. "Plan your holiday spending in advance." Again, makes complete sense. More sense than, say, kissing someone because they're standing under a prickly, poisonous weed.</p>
<p>The funny thing about Christmas advice is that if you actually followed all of it, you wouldn't have time for Christmas. You'd also end up with much larger VISA bills. Note how this actual recipe for Turkey and Mushrooms in Pastry begins: "Preheat Whirlpool SteamClean range to 400°F." Honesty, does that make you feel Christmassy or Appliancy?</p>
<p>All this free advice has forced our old friend Anti Clause out of his hidey-hole. And he's extra grumpy this year because he just got his flu shot. His temperature is frightful and his arm hurts like the dickens. I say we take advantage of his mood and turn him loose on some of the more pedantic pieces of advice.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>Actual tip: "At the buffet table, choose fruits and veggies first."</p>
<p>Anti Clause sez: "To avoid undereating, divide your plate in thirds. Put veggies on one third, fruit on one third, roast beef and mashed potatoes on one third, turkey, ham, perogies and cabbage rolls on one-third and save the final third for pies."</p>
<p>Actual Tip: "Look for easy and inexpensive ways to have fun outside."</p>
<p>Anti Clause sez: "Stealing lawn ornaments can burn over 200 calories an hour -- more if you use a ladder."</p>
<p>Actual Tip: "Avoid cravings by brushing your teeth after every meal."</p>
<p>Anti Clause sez: "Make dental care delicious by dipping your toothbrush in fudge."</p>
<p>Actual Tip: "Get kids to drink more water by adding fresh fruit to it."</p>
<p>Anti Clause sez: "Raspberries in the throat can be easily removed with the Heimlich manoeuvre.</p>
<p>Actual Tip: "Make adequate sleep -- seven to eight hours -- a priority, especially during this busy season."</p>
<p>Anti Clause sez: "Drinking coffee at <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> at 3 a.m. is a reliable way of keeping the adrenaline flowing."</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>It's clear that you couldn't possibly get through the holidays without people you don't know telling you perfectly sensible things that you won't listen to anyway.</p>
<p>Anti-Clause, with his plump, fever-red cheeks all aglow, says it reminds him of the mountain of advice that's piled up with the H1N1 pandemic. "Sneeze into your arm." "Wash hands frequently." "Avoid licking door knobs."</p>
<p>It turns out that Christmas and the H1N1 flu virus have more in common than scientists first thought. For instance, is it really a fever or have you been wearing your parka in the mall too long? Sure your throat is sore, but weren't you just belting out Go Tell It On The Mountain? Your body aches? So does mine. Happens all the time when I'm putting lights on the roof and fall off.</p>
<p>Clearly, what we have here is a potentially dangerous confluence of two powerful forces. Did you know that there are fears of a second wave of H1N1? Coincidentally, there are fears of a second wave of Christmas shopping. It's called Box Day shopping.</p>
<p>Joy or germs? Both are contagious. Unless you want the term "gift exchange" to have a whole new meaning, you must know what you're dealing with. In the interest of public safety, Anti Clause has created this handy chart.</p>
<p>IS IT CHRISTMAS OR H1N1?</p>
<p>H1N1: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Christmas: "There's a new Lexus in our driveway! There's a new Lexus in our driveway! Oh Darren, are you sure we can aff . . . aff. . . t-touch screen n-navigation . . . medi-clinic.</p>
<p>H1N1: Confusion.</p>
<p>Christmas: "Is the line-up for vaccine or The Enchanted Forest?"</p>
<p>H1N1: Child is so irritable she refuses to be held.</p>
<p>Christmas: "Want my Polly Pocket! Want my Polly Pocket! WAAAA!"</p>
<p>H1N1: Bluish skin color.</p>
<p>Christmas: Honey, those LED lights look fabulous on you.</p>
<p>H1N1: Severe or persistent vomiting.</p>
<p>Christmas: Did someone say "Jaggermeister-soaked gummy bears?"</p>
<p>Anti Clause sez: For your own safety, clip this out and tape it to the nearest reindeer. And Happy Holidays. Or Hurl-a-Days, depending on your affliction.</p>

<p>Second place</p>
<p>Ages nine and 10</p>
<p>By Jingfei Tan</p>
<p>Age 10</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm Santa Claus. I'm famous. If you haven't heard of me, you either:</p>
<p>a) live beyond the solar system</p>
<p>b) are the Grinch's cousin</p>
<p>c) are Scrooge's twin</p>
<p>If you are none of the above, please feel free to keep on reading. Here's the story.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>I sent one of the elves down to get a copy of The StarPhoenix. When he got back, a big bold headline jumped out at me. H1N1 HITS!!! Well, I thought at least it's not here in the North Pole! But I was wrong. The rumour got out that H1N1 was out in the North Pole and all the elves started going to get the H1N1 shot. I wanted to get the shot too, but you know, I am the big boss at this workshop, so I'm really busy. Two days later, everybody (even my charming wife) got at least one dose of the shot. Just then, Mrs. Claus rang a bell, "Come and get it!" Well, I'd better go and see what kind of cookies she baked.</p>
<p>"Did you wash you hands, my dear?" asked Mrs. Claus.</p>
<p>"Yes," I lied. (I really want these cookies before the elves get them.) She studied my face she didn't believe me.</p>
<p>"What are you looking at?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing," she replied as she handed those delicious looking cookies over. I wolfed them down. I exited out of the kitchen and went to take a nap. Seconds later, I was asleep. Zzzzzzz!!</p>
<p>When I woke up, I was coughing and sneezing. My head felt dizzy. Mrs. Claus called the doctor. Two minutes later, the doctor was on our doorstep. He took my temperature, looked in my mouth, ears and nose. "I am afraid you have H1N1 flu," said the doctor who was Dr. Jingles. There was a long silence.</p>
<p>"Fudge!" I said. How the jingles am I going to deliver presents?</p>
<p>"Oh, be sure to stay in bed and drink lots of water," said the doctor and he prescribed some medicine. Day after day I lay in bed trying to figure out a way to deliver presents to all the children.</p>
<p>Christmas Eve arrived. I was better but not good enough to ride in the sleigh. Oh, how I wish I didn't lie! Mrs. Claus was standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>"It's not too late," said Mrs. Claus softly.</p>
<p>"It is," I sighed. "Imagine everyone's disappointment when I don't give presents this year."</p>
<p>"Wash your hands," said Mrs. Claus.</p>
<p>"Fine," came the grouchy answer. I washed my hands in the warm water, for like, five minutes. She gave me a kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p>"It's time to go!" said Mrs. Claus. Amazingly, I felt better. I found a sleigh with heaters and warm blankets in it. "Bye!" called Mrs. Claus "Merry Christmas!"</p>
<p>"Merry Christmas to you too!" I waved back.</p>

<p>Who needs magic when you've got modern technology?</p>
<p>In this year's StarPhoenix Christmas Story Writing Contest, Santa fired up his Blackberry (LOL), Danced With the Stars, battled H1N1 and cashed in on EBay.</p>
<p>It seems Santa has embraced the conveniences of modern living, as dozens of Saskatchewan youngsters gave us their take on Christmas.</p>
<p>What's that? The roar of a motorcycle late on Christmas Eve? None other than punk Santa.</p>
<p>The missus threatening to leave unless you lose weight? A popular weight loss centre can help you reach your goal, Mr. Claus.</p>
<p>While there was no end to originality, there was still room for some old-fashioned ideals in the imaginations of our young writers. Puppies and kittens (and the occasional monkey) wiggled their way under the Christmas tree. A sweet tooth was satisfied by more than one candy-coated adventure.</p>
<p>This year's overall winner, The Reindeer With The Candy Coughs, is descriptive, imaginative, and just plain fun.</p>
<p>But whether Santa arrives on a motorcycle, in a time machine or on a sleigh, one thing's for sure: Every story guarantees a happy ending and a smile.</p>

<p>The Saskatoon Health Region's mass H1N1 immunization program is over, but medical officials urge people to get the shot to push vaccination rates closer to the acceptable 50 to 60 per cent range.</p>
<p>About 136,000 people in the health region -- a 46 per cent immunization rate -- were vaccinated in the past two months.</p>
<p>"I think that's quite an achievement," said deputy medical health officer Dr. Ross Findlater on Friday. "There wasn't an actual target for immunization. . . . We wanted to ensure we modified the course of the disease."</p>
<p>The H1N1 pandemic has cost the health region an estimated $2.5 million to $3 million, but a more thorough analysis should be finished in January.</p>
<p>The health region is offering free H1N1 vaccinations through appointments at its public health offices and at a drop-in clinic at 310 Idylwyld Dr.</p>
<p>The drop-in clinic runs Tuesday and Wednesday from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. and on Dec. 29 and Dec. 30 from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Drop-in clinics are also open Tuesday in Lanigan and Watrous.</p>
<p>Residents wanting the H1N1 or seasonal flu shot are asked to book an appointment by calling 655-4358 or 1-877-757-4358.</p>
<p>Since Oct. 5, 696 cases of H1N1 have been confirmed in the health region, with 94 people sent to hospital.</p>
<p>As of Dec. 14, there were five people with H1N1 in intensive care.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mayor praises Leaf charity; MLSE has been 'a terrific partner' in funding derelict skating rinks across Toronto, thankful Miller says</b>
</div><div>Mark Zwolinski   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>748 words</div><div>19 December 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>S02</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>When he was a boy, Toronto mayor David Miller was like dozens of other kids in his High Park neighbourhood - he spent much of his spare time playing shinny at the outdoor rink in the park.</p>
<p>It was fun, usually cold, and there was plenty of good hockey to be had. But Miller also remembers the odd hazard. "Sometimes, it (rink) wasn't in the greatest shape," Miller said in a telephone interview from this week's climate summit in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>"Your stick might get caught in the boards, sometimes you'd get speared.</p>
<p>"... The ice was in bad shape around the boards, and there was usually a lot of snow on the ice."</p>
<p>Now, as the city's leading politician, Miller still enjoys shinny, this time with his kids. And that's not the only difference from the old days.</p>
<p>"It's like night and day now," Miller said, referring to renovations that have brought more than a dozen GTA outdoor rinks out of a deteriorated state.</p>
<p>"I play shinny at that rink with my kids and it's so much different, we have a lot of fun."</p>
<p>That "night and day" effect was something Miller would have liked the city to shoulder, but in this case - and at more than a dozen others at rinks around Toronto - the Leafs' corporate parent (Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment) provided the funds behind the transformation.</p>
<p>Some 13 rinks in Toronto, along with six basketball courts and three soccer fields, have been refurbished and improved through MLSE's charitable foundations.</p>
<p>That foundation was really four separate entities, involving all four of MLSE's teams - Leafs, Raptors, Marlies and TFC. On Dec. 1, all four were brought under one umbrella - the Team Up Foundation - but the need for funding remains.</p>
<p>It took slightly less than $2 million the last four years to complete those rinks, courts and fields. Over the last 15 years, about $30 million has been raised for disadvantaged children.</p>
<p>"They (MLSE) have been a terrific partner.</p>
<p>" ... We do our level best to build a great city, but we wouldn't have these things without them stepping forward. We'd still have the rinks and courts, they'd be functional, but deteriorating," Miller said.</p>
<p>With Christmas fast approaching, the Leafs' corporate arm, as well as the players, realize this is the time to give back to the community.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Leaf players Mike Komisarek, Luke Schenn and Francois Beauchemin visited Sick Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>That kind of story is told throughout the NHL, as well as all the major pro sports leagues, which see athletes bring toys to children who are battling cancer and other diseases and can't be home for Christmas.</p>
<p>Five teams in the NHL this year postponed their annual hospital visits due to the spread of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, though, the team made up its cancelled visit by creating a video Christmas card, a production that can be seen on the team's website and one that has caught attention as one of the most creative and touching gestures in team sports.</p>
<p>Beyond that, players like the Leafs Jamal Mayers and hundreds of others in the NHL adopt a family for Christmas. "Basically, we (with his wife) get gifts for a family that cannot afford gifts at Christmas," Mayers said.</p>
<p>"We do that in St. Louis, too. Christmas is a time for kids and we try to do our small part to help."</p>
<p>This year, the league and the NHL Players' Association are supplementing their respective charitable foundations with a thermal blanket program, where teams visiting hospitals are given the blankets to hand out to children who suffer chills after treatments.</p>
<p>But while millions of dollars have been raised, the value behind the funds remains the same - to help those who cannot otherwise be home for Christmas, or cannot afford gifts and food.</p>
<p>That aim was an eye-opening experience for Leafs' rookie goalie Jonas Gustavsson of Sweden.</p>
<p>"We usually put money into baskets, that's what was done in Sweden, but here you visit people and there is a responsibility to help," Gustavsson said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu-shot clinics ending; Doctors' offices, walk-in sites still offering H1N1 immunization</b>
</div><div>Richard Watts   </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>592 words</div><div>19 December 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>Mass-immunization clinics against H1N1 flu are winding down in the province, with the last one on southern Vancouver Island finishing up today in Langford.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants protection against the disease can still get a shot from doctors' offices or walk-in clinics, but should inquire beforehand to see if the vaccine is available. A few clinics are planned in coming days up-Island, with dates expected to be listed on the Vancouver Island Health Authority website.</p>
<p>Another option is to go to pharmacies where pharmacists have been trained to deliver the vaccine, or to public health units that are offering the shots.</p>
<p>As the mass clinics wrap up, public-health officials are beginning to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Sandra Herbison, manager of child, youth and family health for the health authority, said the campaign required not only public health nurses, but also help from other health professionals in just about every area in the health authority.</p>
<p>Retired nurses also agreed to come back to work and a huge number of volunteers showed up to help keep clinics orderly.</p>
<p>"We had about 90 clinics in eight weeks, from Port Renfrew and the Gulf Islands [and] from the top of the Peninsula down to Oak Bay," said Herbison.</p>
<p>"It was a huge initiative and it was layered on top of everything else that we do," she said. "There was the expectation that we would continue with most of our other programs and services -- and we did."</p>
<p>She noted that about 300,000 doses of vaccine have been handed out on Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, with 115,000 administered in mass vaccine clinics, 45,000 on the south Island. About 180,000 doses were sent to doctors and other health-care providers.</p>
<p>That suggests only about 40 per cent of the 740,000 people on Vancouver Island have been immunized, significantly fewer than the 66 per cent provincial public-health officials were hoping to reach by Christmas.</p>
<p>But officials are still hopeful the numbers will rise.</p>
<p>"We've been recommending to people that one of the best Christmas presents they can give themselves is the flu shot," said Dr. Eric Young, deputy provincial health officer. "And we are still suggesting that."</p>
<p>Young noted the province has received about 3.2 million doses of the vaccine so far, about 2.5 million of which have been distributed to health authorities.</p>
<p>Young said provincially, it's estimated that just over 40 per cent of the population has been immunized.</p>
<p>But the vaccine will continue to be available and will also be offered with regular seasonal flu shots. The two can be administered at the same time.</p>
<p>Young anticipates interest in getting the vaccine will rise if it appears a third wave of the illness is on the way.</p>
<p>The first wave arrived last April, while the second, now drawing to a close, appeared in September. Some speculate a third wave could turn up sometime next year if insufficient numbers of people are vaccinated.</p>
<p>Provincial government figures released this week show that since April, 1,032 people have fallen severely ill from H1N1, including 139 on Vancouver Island, while 51 have died, including 10 on Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>rwatts@tc.canwest.com</p>
<p>A mass vaccination clinic is set for today in Langford at the Westshore Child, Family and Youth Centre, 345 Wale Rd., from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Holiday Etiquette Quiz</b>
</div><div>Canwest News Service; Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1302 words</div><div>19 December 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>G3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Etiquette expert Julie Blais Comeau has come up with this holiday quiz. Give your gut responses for each of the scenarios, then read below to learn what to do for appropriate seasonal celebrating.</p>
<p>1. You exchange gifts with your best friend during a holiday drink. She presents you with a copy of Julie & Julia. One of your colleagues gave you a copy the week before. You know your sister-in-law loved the movie. You simply change the tag and re-gift it. Is re-gifting acceptable?</p>
<p>2. Your son's hockey coach gives you a holiday-cheer invitation for Saturday night after your son's game. The invitation has your and your spouse's names on it. Do you assume that children are invited?</p>
<p>3. January marks the one-year anniversary in your current position. Your boss is amazing, makes work fun, and always has time for you. He is a wine connoisseur and an avid golfer. On the last day of work before your holiday break, you show your gratitude by offering a 2007 Mike Weir Pinot Noir. You feel good about your choice: You are encouraging Canadian winemakers and proceeds from the sale of the wine will go to the Mike Weir Foundation. Is your gift appropriate?</p>
<p>4. It is Dec. 23 and, after a long last day before your vacation, you click your garage-door opener and pull up the driveway as your neighbour walks up to your car with gift in hand. She informs you that she and her family are leaving to spend the holidays on a beach in Cuba. You need not worry about their home, as her brother and his girlfriend will be there to care for their dog and plants. She hands you the gift bag and offers you her best wishes. You thank her gratefully, wish her a wonderful trip, season's greeting and send her a thank-you note without reciprocating a gift. Is this a good-neighbour policy?</p>
<p>5. Financially, it has been a difficult year and you can't afford to give even a token gift to a service provider. Can you forgo gifts this year?</p>
<p>6. Your gift list for your children's teachers, day-care workers and coaches could make up a baker's dozen. This year, you decide to be efficient and make the trip on your own to buy, in bulk, one gender-neutral gift in a variety of colours and styles. Your children will make personalized gift cards. Is this a good strategy?</p>
<p>7. You kick off the holiday season by attending a performance of the Nutcracker with your parents, aunt and uncle. Everyone meets at your home for a potluck meal. As planned, your aunt and cousins bring an appetizer. Cousin Rachel brings a gelatin cream-cheese mould in the shape of a wreath with kiwis on the surface and, for a festive touch, crushed candy-cane sprinkles. It gets put in the back of the fridge. Should you have served the dish?</p>
<p>8. You are a first-year university student without any family in town, and have been invited to a fellow student's house for Christmas dinner. You are a vegetarian but don't want to burden the host. Should you let your eating habits be known?</p>
<p>9. Friends are hosting an open house. They and their daughters have received the H1N1 vaccine. To ensure a safe celebration, the hosts have decided to have a no-handshake party and, instead, greet guests with fist bumps and hugs without kisses. Is this greeting acceptable?</p>
<p>10. Your parents live miles away and visit during the holidays, when they spoil your children. You graciously thank your parents, but know there is no way your kids will wear all the cute outfits. Once they leave, you give some of the toys to charity and exchange the outfits for more practical wear. Should you have kept the gifts?</p>
<p>SEE HOW APPROPRIATE YOUR RESPONSES ARE</p>
<p>And the etiquette expert says ...</p>
<p>1. Re-gifting used to be a complete no-no, but is generally acceptable, given the economic situation. Recycling a gift is also OK if it's store-bought with originally packaging and tags and not made especially for you. Remember, as Oprah says, "doubt means don't." If you're afraid of hurting someone's feelings, or there's a slim chance that your worlds will collide, don't.</p>
<p>2. Call a sitter on this one. Without the children's names on the invitation, they're not invited. The same rule applies to the office party. Generally, all invitees are listed on the invitation. If you receive a work invitation with only your name on it, go solo, especially during office hours. When in doubt, simply ask the host.</p>
<p>3. Although a good choice for this person, gifts to the boss are discouraged. They may be perceived as seeking personal favours and, for that reason, it's best to offer a group gift or to express sentiments in a card. Alcoholic gifts are discouraged, especially in the workplace.</p>
<p>4. This is appropriate if you don't want to reciprocate gifts annually with your neighbour, especially since you took the time to write a thank-you note. The same would apply to holiday cards. Should you receive a greeting card and not wish to include the good-wisher on your annual list, just thank her the next time you see or speak to her. If you wish to add her to your list, reciprocate by sending your holiday card. You can always have a couple of "just in case" gifts wrapped and ready to go. A hostess gift with a holiday theme such as centrepieces, ornaments, hand towels, family games, fancy glasses or a box of chocolates is ideal.</p>
<p>5. Due to your current budgetary restrictions, it's OK to forgo this tradition. The main point of this gesture is the recognition of good service throughout the year. Express your appreciation in a holiday card, with or without an explanation for the absence of tip or gift. Your card could be accompanied by baked goods or a homemade craft.</p>
<p>6. This strategy works. Not every gift has to be different. It especially works, since your children will be involved in the process and will learn the tradition of gift-giving in recognition of the efforts and affection of those around them. Holiday music CDs, ornaments, plants, or gift cards to a bookstore, coffee shop or movie theatre are good options.</p>
<p>7. Although it may not appeal to you and your other guests, as a hostess, you graciously accept the contribution and serve it. If you receive a box of chocolates as a hostess gift, you would serve it at dessert. On the other hand, if you receive a bottle of wine, you have the choice of saving it for later or serving it, if it pairs well with your meal.</p>
<p>8. It's best to inform your host and volunteer to bring a vegetarian dish. If a guest has allergies, it's imperative to advise the host.</p>
<p>9. Yes, greeting alternatives are acceptable. No matter what your choice is, greet everyone in the same way without discriminating.</p>
<p>10. Because gift receipts are often enclosed, it's easy and acceptable to take something back to the store, exchange it or offer it to charity, if you won't use or don't like it, except when it's one of a kind or made especially for you.</p>

<p>THE number of Manitobans with H1N1 being admitted to intensive care this fall continues to be much lower than during the virus's first wave this spring.</p>
<p>Manitoba Health reported Thursday that no one testing positive for H1N1 was admitted to an intensive care unit between Dec. 8 and 14.</p>
<p>In its final flu bulletin in 2009, the department said there have been 16 patients with lab-confirmed cases of H1N1 admitted to ICUs this fall, compared with 43 in the first wave.</p>
<p>Of the 16 cases this fall, more than three-quarters were aged 18 to 64. One-third of all Manitobans admitted to ICUs in the two H1N1 flu waves had no underlying health problems.</p>
<p>The department still encourages Manitobans to get the H1N1 flu shot, saying the virus continues to circulate within the province and it's expected that people will still get seriously ill from it.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of Manitobans have yet to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Mass flu vaccination clinics in Winnipeg have closed. But city residents can still get the shot from their doctors or from community clinics. To book your flu shot at a Winnipeg clinic, call 788-8004.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Guelph Wellness Initiative goes through growing pains</b>
</div><div>Joanne Shuttleworth   </div>
<div>Mercury Staff</div>
<div>635 words</div><div>18 December 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Well, things have kind of fallen apart with the Guelph Wellness Initiative. But organizers are regrouping and promise there will be something to it in the new year.</p>
<p>The initiative officially launched Sept. 8, but three things derailed the program before it really got off the ground.</p>
<p>First, Ron Woznow, chief executive of the Advanced Foods and Materials Network and originator of the initiative, has left the city.</p>
<p>Second, Paula Allen has also left the network. Allen was the wellness initiative project co-ordinator.</p>
<p>And third, the baseline clinics scheduled for early November were cancelled when the volunteer team of registered nurses were pulled away to staff H1N1 vaccination clinics.</p>
<p>Now, with Christmas coming and snowbirds heading south, the opportunity to capture the "before" measurements of participants already registered with the initiative has passed.</p>
<p>"We're at Square 1 - more like Ground Zero," Perry Lidster, AFMNet's new managing director, said earlier this week. "It's a bit of a mess.</p>
<p>"But our advisory and scientific committees are meeting this week to develop a new road map. We'll have plans to relaunch early in the new year."</p>
<p>"We don't want to miss the resolution market in January," agreed Louise Jessup, communications manager for the network.</p>
<p>The goal of the Guelph Wellness Initiative is to demonstrate that the wellness of a community can be improved through a combination of citizen engagement, education and program accessibility.</p>
<p>The plan was to sign up at least 2,000 participants and measure a number of wellness indicators at the beginning of the program and then again about six months later. In the meantime, the hope was that community groups would step up and offer free or inexpensive wellness activities, like yoga classes, cooking classes, or motivational speakers.</p>
<p>AFMNet has the education component covered, at least where food comes in. It is a national network of folks devoted to food research that includes scientific researchers, professionals, government and industry partners, all with an interest in advancements in food and materials made from agricultural products. Its function is to be a clearing house for information and Lidster said it will funnel information for participants of the wellness initiative.</p>
<p>Dr. Ahmed El-Sohemy, an associate professor at the University of Toronto, is looking for genetic reasons why people like or dislike certain foods. His research on the sweet tooth gene is posted on the wellness website, www.guelphwellness.ca[http://www.guelphwellness.ca], but Lidster said there will be other useful information posted for participants in the coming months.</p>
<p>Science will also drive the information collected at the baseline clinics.</p>
<p>"The clinics will happen, but we might want different indicators so we can track this more scientifically," Lidster said. "We want a final product based on science that people will be happy with."</p>
<p>At its launch, numerous organizations had signed on as supporters of the initiative. Heavy hitters included Guelph General Hospital, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health, the University of Guelph, the City of Guelph, the YMCA-YWCA of Guelph and the Homewood Health Centre.</p>
<p>"We hope that with Ken Murray still on board as honorary chair, we'll maintain that community component," Lidster said.</p>
<p>The active, energetic 85-year-old Murray said Thursday he's met once with Lidster and feels confident there will be a new plan that will gain traction.</p>
<p>"They want to go home to a blank page, to articulate precisely what the objectives are," he said.</p>
<p>"I think that's a good idea. Let's see what they come up with."</p>
<p>"We lost momentum without Paula and Ron, but we're still behind it. We still believe in it," Jessup said.</p>
<p>"We're moving in the right direction. This is Day 1 of Round 2," Lidster said.</p>

</p>
<p>Favourites posted only their second winning record in five weeks, going 8-7-1 in Week 14. When the Patriots, who were 131/2-point favourites, beat the Panthers 20-10, it marked the seventh straight week in which the biggest favourite failed to cover the spread. One other winning favourite failed to cover last week, as the Saints, favoured by 101/2, beat the Falcons 26-23. Here's a look at the Week 15 matchups:</p>
<p>TOMORROW</p>
<p>COWBOYS (+7) AT SAINTS</p>
<p>The Cowboys lead this series 14-8, but the Saints have won the last five, including three at home. In their last two games, the Saints have squeaked out three-point victories. But ... Take Saints.</p>
<p>SUNDAY</p>
<p>PACKERS (+2) AT STEELERS</p>
<p>The Steelers could become the first defending Super Bowl champions to lose six straight games the following season. During their five-game losing streak, the Steelers have scored only eight touchdowns. Take Packers.</p>
<p>DOLPHINS (+3) AT TITANS</p>
<p>Titans QB Vince Young draws special attention, but the young Dolphins would be wise to also pay particular attention to running-back Chris Johnson. Toss a coin ... Take Titans.</p>
<p>PATRIOTS (-71/2) AT BILLS</p>
<p>The Bills have impressive punting statistics. However, the Patriots have a considerable edge in four or five other categories. Even in windy conditions ... Take Patriots.</p>
<p>CARDINALS (-12) AT LIONS</p>
<p>Cardinals QB Kurt Warner won't make as many risky passes against the Lions as he did in last week's giveaway to the 49ers. Superior talent will tell the story here. Take Cardinals.</p>
<p>49ERS (+81/2) AT EAGLES</p>
<p>The 49ers' upset over the careless Cardinals last week should serve as a reminder to the Eagles, who have big-play possibilities on offence and defence. Take Eagles.</p>
<p>FALCONS (NO LINE) AT JETS</p>
<p>Jets head coach Rex Ryan didn't confirm it, but it looks like rookie QB Mark Sanchez will start. Sanchez hurt his knee, but practised yesterday. Take Jets.</p>
<p>BEARS (+11) AT RAVENS</p>
<p>The Ravens are home, where they have lost only twice this season. The Bears, for the seventh time in two years, blew a fourth-quarter lead last week. Take Ravens.</p>
<p>BROWNS (+2) AT CHIEFS</p>
<p>Chiefs QB Matt Cassel has been involved in 57 losing plays this season: 41 sacks, 13 interceptions and three lost fumbles. Browns QB Brady Quinn hasn't been intercepted in four games. Take Browns.</p>
<p>TEXANS (-10) AT RAMS</p>
<p>Four of the Rams' 12 losses have been by at least 28 points. The Texans lost four straight recently by an average of 4.8 points. This is easier, as the Rams cancelled their practice yesterday because many players are battling swine flu. Take Texans.</p>
<p>BENGALS (+7) AT CHARGERS</p>
<p>The Chargers have won eight in a row and their last six games in December. Running-back LaDainian Tomlinson must be licking his chops in anticipation. Take Chargers.</p>
<p>RAIDERS (+14) AT BRONCOS</p>
<p>The Broncos' Brandon Marshall caught an NFL-record 21 passes in last week's loss to the Colts, but said, "at the end of the day, our goal is to win." They'll do that here. Take Broncos</p>
<p>BUCS (+6) AT SEAHAWKS</p>
<p>Seahawks head coach Jim Mora doesn't like to hear his team being perceived as "soft." "We're working hard to make sure that's not true," he said. Take Seahawks.</p>
<p>VIKINGS (-9) AT PANTHERS</p>
<p>Last season, the Panthers scored at least 30 points seven times. This year, they've scored 20 or less 10 times. The Vikings can double that by halftime. Take Vikings.</p>
<p>MONDAY</p>
<p>GIANTS (-3) AT REDSKINS</p>
<p>The Giants have won six of the last seven games in this series, including the last three in Washington. However, they have lost their last three games on road by an</p>
<p>average of 21.3 points. Take Giants.</p>
<p>RECORD vs. SPREAD</p>
<p>Last week: 11-5.</p>
<p>Overall: 112-95-1.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Cost-cutting pays off for Transat; Posts Q4 profit of $18.1 million</b>
</div><div>FRANCOIS SHALOM   </div>

</p>
<p>Tour operator <span class="companylink">Transat A.T. Inc</span>.'s earnings for the fourth quarter nearly doubled analysts' estimates, reporting net income of $18.1 million, or 52 cents per share, for the quarter ending Oct. 31. Analysts had forecast 27 cents per share.</p>
<p>In the quarter last year, the Montreal-based travel company, Canada's largest, posted a a loss of $82.4 million.</p>
<p>Shares in Transat jumped $2.41 to close at $20 in Toronto yesterday.</p>
<p>The company achieved the latest results against a backdrop of falling revenues and a still-sluggish tourism outlook. Revenues fell nine per cent to $719 million for the period, which company chief executive Jean-Marc Eustache attributed to the slow economy and the H1N1 pandemic. The firm's North American business fell 10 per cent and traffic from Europe also dropped. Transat is a big player in the French travel market.</p>
<p>Eustache added that the much-improved profits came as a result of the company's cost-reduction measures, including sub-contracting some flights to CanJet, yielding higher margins.</p>
<p>One analyst, David Newman of National Bank Financial, raised his 12-month target price for Transat shares from $20 to $23.</p>
<p>Canadian bookings to sun destinations this winter have tapered off from the quarter last year, when Transat recorded record volumes.</p>
<p>Eustache said in a teleconference call that next summer is looking good. "Canada is selling very well," he said, but not traditional destinations Mexico and France.</p>

<p>A strain of natural human proteins has been found to help ward off swine flu and other viruses, including West Nile and dengue, in a discovery that could spur improved treatments, researchers said yesterday.</p>
<p>In cultured human cells, researchers led by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Chevy Chase, Md., found certain proteins have powerful antiviral effects by blocking the replication of viruses.</p>
<p>The findings, reported in an online article from the journal Cell, "could lead to the development of more effective antiviral drugs, including prophylactic drugs that could be used to slow influenza transmission," the team said.</p>
<p>Viruses must take over proteins in cells to sustain themselves. In their study, researchers found 120 genes that are needed by the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu.</p>
<p>"But in figuring that out, we found this other class of genes that actually have the opposite effect, so that if you get rid of them, influenza replicates much better," team leader Stephen Elledge said.</p>
<p>Increasing the production of the proteins therefore enables a complete blockade of the virus's replication.</p>
<p>In a surprise discovery, the scientists who had been focused on H1N1 found the proteins also blocked other viruses, like those causing West Nile disease and dengue fever.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>An enigma wrapped in a football uniform; Understanding Patriot's Moss doesn't get easier</b>
</div><div>Bruce Arthur   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>1083 words</div><div>18 December 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>All But Toronto</div><div>B11</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Look, I'd love to complete this sentence, but it's about Randy Moss, so it seems appropriate to kind of give it a token effort, go through the motions, and then ... um ...</p>
<p>Sorry, were you expecting that sentence to be completed with rigorous focus and attention to detail? OK, OK. Let's try again. Randy Moss is a really good receiver for the New England Patriots, and he has all the talent in the world, but sometimes he can get a little sulky, a little moody, a little ... mmm ... uhhh ...</p>
<p>What, you expect every sentence to get completed the way it's been designed? Next you'll demand that Randy Moss runs his routes with effort, not give up on the play, and actually do his best to catch the football. Pfft.</p>
<p>Moss once again took centre stage in the NFL by quietly shuffling around in the wings. First he was late to a Patriots practice along with three other players, and all four were sent home. Then on Sunday against the Carolina Panthers: one catch, 16 yards, and he fumbled it. What happened out there, Carolina defensive backs?</p>
<p>"We know from watching film on Moss, once you get him out of the game early, he's gonna shut it down," Panthers cornerback Chris Gamble told The Boston Herald. "That's what we wanted to do him. That's what we did.... He'd just give up a lot."</p>
<p>"You get physical with him, and I don't want to say he quits, but he kind of doesn't run the routes the way they're supposed to be run," safety Chris Harris told the Herald. "He'll just ease up."</p>
<p>No, no, you must be mistaken. That's the old Randy -- the impossibly talented receiver who quit at the end in Minnesota, then dogged it in Oakland, and then landed with the Patriots.</p>
<p>But there, he was reborn, right? He had 98 catches for 1,493 yards and an NFL-record 23 touchdowns his first year in New England, when the Patriots when 16-0. Without the injured Tom Brady last year, Moss's numbers dipped to 69 catches, 1,008 yards, 11 TDs, but hey, he was basically working with a rookie QB.</p>
<p>This season, Moss's numbers are good, but unlike his hobo beard, they're also diminishing. Sure, his fellow Patriots rushed to his defence this week -- "He is one of the favourite guys I've ever played with," said Brady. But after losing to Miami two weeks ago, Brady also said "I don't think we fight very hard." He probably wasn't talking about Wes Welker.</p>
<p>Oh, well. It's not like the guy is pulling in US$288,235.29 per game in base salary. What's that saying about how sports don't build character, they reveal it? Ah, forget it. I can't be bothered to look it up.</p>
<p>Last week, this space went 6-10 for the second straight week. We'd love to say we weren't really trying. As always, all lines could change.</p>
<p>Dallas (+7) at New Orleans</p>
<p>Can we just agree that Drew Brees is the MVP? Oh, we can't? But it's so true. Pick: New Orleans</p>
<p>Chicago (+10) at Baltimore Just a second ... just gotta reel in this interception from Jay Cutler. Pick: Baltimore</p>
<p>New England (-7) at Buffalo Upon hearing the Bills had claimed offensive lineman Richie Incognito off waivers, Bills linebacker Kawika Mitchell Tweeted, "THE GUYS A BUM. DIRTY AND ALWAYS WILL BE ... SERIOUSLY... I KNO WE'RE N NEED OF OLINE BUT THIS GUY SUKS BALLS." Teamwork! Pick: New England</p>
<p>Arizona (-11) at Detroit Mike Ditka was 13-0 picking the winner on Monday night until Arizona's remarkable bout of hari-kari against San Francisco last week. Better sleep with one eye open, Kurt Warner. Pick: Arizona</p>
<p>Cleveland (+2) at Kansas City My eyes ... the goggles do nothing! Pick: Cleveland</p>
<p>San Francisco (+9) at Philadelphia</p>
<p>We've now reached that point of the season where the Eagles make you think that, man, that team could be a real darkhorse in the playoffs. For Eagles fans, it traditionally goes downhill from here. Pick: Philadelphia</p>
<p>Houston (-12.5) at St. Louis Yesterday, the Rams cancelled practice due to the swine flu. Hey, it's not like being healthy and practising has worked so far. Pick: Houston</p>
<p>Miami (+4) at Tennessee Chris Johnson is the most exciting player in the NFL. Especially -- especially -- if he is on your fantasy team. Ahem.</p>
<p>Pick: Miami Atlanta (+6) at New York Jets</p>
<p>Since coach Rex Ryan cried during a team meeting, the Jets are 3-1. The wins: Carolina, Buffalo in Toronto, and Tampa Bay. So it's not quite a causal relationship, is it? Pick: Atlanta</p>
<p>Oakland (+14) at Denver JaMarcus Russell watch: Um, he's just kind of standing there. I think he's eating a burrito. Pick: Denver</p>
<p>Cincinnati (+6.5) at San Diego</p>
<p>Chris Henry was a troubled young man. May he rest in peace. Pick: San Diego</p>
<p>Green Bay (pick) at Pittsburgh</p>
<p>Aaron Rodgers has a better passer rating than Peyton Manning. Yep. Pick: Green Bay</p>
<p>Tampa Bay (+7) at Seattle Um ... uh ... [gives up on pick, grows hobo beard]. Pick: Seattle</p>
<p>Minnesota (-8) at Carolina How good is Minnesota's offensive line? Just one of Brett Favre's 129 career fumbles has come this season. Pick: Minnesota</p>
<p>N.Y. Giants (-3) at Washington</p>
<p>Reviled Washington executive VP Vinny Cerrato was cashiered yes terday. His classy exit quote? "I've had the pleasure of working with some great coaches such as Joe Gibbs, Greg Blache and Sherman Lewis," Cerrato said, naming the current defensive and offensive co-ordinators, but not current head coach Jim Zorn. A better quote? Redskins running back Rock Cartwright: "I wish [Cerrato] the best, and hopefully I don't see him down the road." Pick: Washington</p>
<p>Last week 6-10. Season 107-101.</p>

receiver Randy Moss is no stranger to controversy. Last week the

<p>Sarnia, Ont. -- • What more can Dalton and his merry band do next to ensure that Ontario will not see another Liberal-led government in our lifetime? Scandals, H1N1 screw-ups, rampant deficits, bailouts, child-like antics in the legislature and more. Now our fearless (or is that clueless?) Premier, on the heels of sucking more money out of our depleted pockets via the HST, is contemplating selling the family jewels.</p>
<p>People, rise up, take your ploughshares, march to the legislature and let Dalton and his band know they should enjoy the view – it will be their last for generations to come.</p>

<p>MUSIC</p>
<p>Barenaked for the Holidays</p>
<p>Bravo!, 7 p.m.</p>
<p>From happier times, this 2005 special was filmed long before Barenaked Ladies split into two separate factions – one consisting solely of singer Steven Page. Hosted by Marilyn Denis, the concert finds the minstrels of mirth tearing through a selection of Christmas and Hanukkah standards from their holiday album released the previous year. They work in a few of their chart hits, including If I Had a Million Dollars.</p>
<p>ANIMATED</p>
<p>Frosty the Snowman</p>
<p>CBS, 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, this festive special was inspired by a popular children's song. Based on the 1950 hit by Gene Autry and first shown in 1969, the animated story is narrated by the late Jimmy Durante, who relates the story of a snowman with a corncob pipe and button nose and eyes made out of coal. The late Jackie Vernon voices Frosty, while the late Billy De Wolfe supplies the voice of the requisite villain. Come to think of it, every single person involved in making this special has long since passed on. But don't let that spoil anyone's fun.</p>
<p>MUSIC</p>
<p>Michael Bublé Meets Madison Square Garden</p>
<p>CTV, 10 p.m.</p>
<p>This special captures Michael Bublé's career-making show at the famed Madison Square Garden in late 2008. The multiple Grammy-winner has the crowd on their feet minutes into his song list. The program features highlights from the show and includes backstage interviews with Bublé's devoted band members.</p>
<p>FOOD</p>
<p>Ramsay's Kitchen</p>
<p>nightmares</p>
<p>Food Network, 11 p.m.</p>
<p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay is no less demanding in this British restaurant makeover series than on Hell's Kitchen. A staple of the British TV diet since 2004, the series takes Ramsay to a foundering restaurant and allows him one week to turn things around in his blistering manner. Tonight, Ramsay drops into the swanky Bonapartes bistro in Silsden, West Yorkshire, and stumbles onto a horrendous problem: The 21-year-old head chef barely knows how to cook.</p>

<p>So camp it's cool, this 1985 holiday special is a spinoff of the animated series He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. Compared to kids shows of today, the story is terrifically complicated: He-Man and his platonic female pal She-Ra try to help two earth kids obtain a Christmas tree, while battling the villain Skeletor, or something like that. More interesting, however, is the unique mid-eighties style of artwork, long since phased out by computer-generation animation.</p>

</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus has claimed another life in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>The death of a man in his 30s, with underlying health conditions, was reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada on Thursday. That brings the number of H1N1 deaths in the province to 15.</p>
<p>Most of these people had serious underlying health conditions and fall into the following age categories:</p>
<p>- Two men in their 70s;</p>
<p>- One man in his 60s;</p>
<p>- Four women and two men in their 50s;</p>
<p>- A woman in her 40s;</p>
<p>- Two men in their 30s;</p>
<p>- Two children under 20 years of age; and</p>
<p>- An infant</p>
<p>The H1N1 mass immunization clinics are continuing at the former Robert Usher Collegiate, 1440 9th Ave. N. The last clinic of the year will be held Monday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Clinic doors will reopen Jan. 4 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>In order to staff mass H1N1 immunization clinics, public health nursing services were scaled back in a number of areas, including the Travel Health Centre in Regina.</p>
<p>"People can call for appointments now and we'll get them in as quickly as we can, but we won't have a full complement of nurses until January 4," said Lori Foster, spokeswoman for the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region.</p>
<p>Those interested in booking an appointment at the travel centre are asked to call 766-7600.</p>
<p>Beginning in January, parents can call to book immunization services for children 18 months and four years of age.</p>
<p>Call 766-7536 to make an appointment at the 1911 Park St. clinic and phone 766-7533 for the clinic at 204 Wascana St. and rural areas near Regina. Residents in other rural areas are asked to call their local public health office.</p>
<p>Prenatal classes will begin in the new year.</p>
<p>Those wishing to attend can register by calling 766-7733. And on Jan. 6, the Breastfeeding Support Centre at 204 Wascana St. will reopen. The drop-in service will be available from 1 to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>On behalf of the region, Foster thanked residents for their patience and understanding while public health nursing services were adjusted to accommodate the pandemic H1N1 mass immunization campaign.</p>

<p>The Top 10 Occupational Risk Factors for Santa Claus:</p>
<p>1. Climbing down chimneys -- cancer from soot exposure and confined spaces.</p>

<p>4. Cold/heat exposure -- frost-bitten nose and toes; burns from fireplaces.</p>
<p>5. Obesity from all the cookies and milk -- risk for hypertension, maturity onset diabetes, sleep apnea.</p>
<p>6. Shift work -- increased risk for heart disease, GERD, injury and cancer.</p>
<p>7. Reindeer exposure -- tic bites and Lyme disease; allergies and asthma from the hay/straw.</p>
<p>8. Slips and falls from the roofs.</p>
<p>9. Stress from meeting the tight timelines and expectations.</p>
<p>10. Infections including H1N1.</p>

</div><div>Colette Derworiz   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>820 words</div><div>17 December 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>The H1N1-related death of an otherwise healthy 16-year-old has his father and health authorities reminding Calgarians to get their flu shots before the mass vaccination clinics close permanently next week.</p>
<p>Health officials said Wednesday that an adolescent male died after contracting the new strain of influenza.</p>
<p>Kris Gorbous, who spoke out last month about the importance of getting the flu vaccine as his son was in hospital fighting H1N1, confirmed that his son had died.</p>
<p>"Michael did pass away," Gorbous told the Herald, declining further comment.</p>
<p>Friends, however, remembered Michael as an amazing person.</p>
<p>"He was really, really outgoing," said Myles Cronkhite, who became best friends with Michael at Calgary Academy.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Visit our website to see Michael Gorbous's story</p>
<p>"He was a kid you would never have a problem talking to, he was always there to listen to us, he was never afraid to express his own opinion," said Cronkhite, adding his friend enjoyed playing video games, watching <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> and hanging out at the Southland Leisure Centre.</p>
<p>Others suggested on a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> site dedicated to his memory that he always put a smile on their faces.</p>
<p>Both Michael's father and the health region again encouraged people to get vaccinated against H1N1.</p>
<p>"It's a sad situation and our condolences certainly go out to the family and friends of this individual," said Judy MacDonald, deputy medical officer of health with Alberta Health Services in Calgary. "It is a reminder, though, that influenza is with us. H1N1 activity is lower than it was earlier, but it is still happening.</p>
<p>"Your best defence against this infection is to get vaccinated," Mac-Donald said.</p>
<p>About 1.1 million Albertans -- including 460,000 Calgarians -- have gotten the H1N1 vaccination since the campaign got off to a controversial start in October, when clinics were plagued by long lineups and officials had to suspend the program due to concerns about a shortage of doses.</p>
<p>MacDonald said that the mass vaccination clinics will only be available until Dec. 23, when they'll close for Christmas.</p>
<p>"We will have to revisit what we'll do in the new year," she said, "but this is an opportunity, especially with the children being off school. Parents can bring their children to those clinics on Saturday or next week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday."</p>
<p>Staged closures of the clinics started last week as the number of people seeking vaccinations has dwindled.</p>
<p>The vaccine will continue to be available this week and next at three mass vaccination clinics: Avenida, Brentwood and Whitehorn.</p>
<p>A clinic at the Stampede Grandstand, which has been less busy, closes at 3:30 p.m. Friday.</p>
<p>After Dec. 23, patients can get the vaccine by appointment at doctors' offices and some pharmacies, although MacDonald said pharmacists and many physicians won't be able to vaccinate children under the age of 10 due to record-keeping requirements.</p>
<p>She reminded Albertans that there could still be a third wave of H1N1.</p>
<p>"It's really early in the respiratory virus season," she said. "We're just getting into the winter now.</p>
<p>"If you wait to see if there is going to be another wave, it'll be too late. It does take 10 to 14 days to develop immunity once you are vaccinated."</p>
<p>Michael Gorbous, one of the youngest Albertans to die from H1N1, contracted the flu on Oct. 22 before the vaccine became available.</p>
<p>He began experiencing chest pain by the sixth day of his illness, but he was told by paramedics he could stay home because his vitals were strong.</p>
<p>By Nov. 2, however, his condition deteriorated and he was admitted to Foothills Medical Centre, where doctors placed him in a medically induced coma so they could control his breathing with a respirator. He had pneumonia in both lungs and has lost 40 pounds by the end of November, his family had said in an earlier interview with the Herald.</p>
<p>Michael appeared to be improving, but his friends said he contracted another lung infection this week before he died.</p>
<p>Dr. Jim Dickenson, a family physician and University of Calgary professor, said there have been some cases where H1N1 has killed people with no other health conditions.</p>
<p>"It's truly tragic," he said. "That's the puzzle of this particular type of flu. It's pretty mild, but a few people get it pretty bad."</p>
<p>Michael's death brings the number of fatalities related to H1N1 to 65 people across Alberta.</p>
<p>There have also been 1,255 people hospitalized -- including 391 in the Calgary region -- due to complications from the illness.</p>

<p>An editorial in the Calgary Herald:</p>
<p>Remember how your mother used to say that everyone has to eat a peck of dirt before they die?</p>
<p>A Northwestern University study has just proven that mom was right.</p>
<p>Study author Thomas McDade says that "ultraclean, ultra-hygienic environments early in life" can heighten the risk for a variety of diseases later, including heart ailments.</p>
<p>The study noted inflammation rates in people in the Philippines from birth until they were 22, inflammation being evidence that the immune system has fought off an infection or wound.</p>
<p>Researchers concluded that adults are healthier when they've been exposed to bacteria and microbes as children.</p>
<p>It makes sense. The immune system is strengthened by such exposure; it cannot be strengthened in antiseptic isolation.</p>
<p>That's one reason why researchers have previously deplored the use of antibacterial soaps and hand sanitizers. They're necessary when unusual circumstances, such as the H1N1 pandemic, strike, but in the course of daily life, absent a public health threat, they do more harm than good.</p>
<p>Here's the dirt on clean: Plain soap and water are sufficient for handwashing, and kids need to be allowed to get down and dirty if they're going to grow up to be strong and healthy.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The extraordinary power of vaccines</b>
</div><div>Elizabeth Payne   </div>

</p>
<p>You might be forgiven for thinking the vaccine was a new invention after witnessing the fuss over the pandemic H1N1 immunization campaign this fall.</p>
<p>People agonized over whether or not to get it, consulted friends, neighbours and the Internet, and talked about it endlessly. In the end, close to 47 per cent of Ottawa residents lined up to get jabbed, which is significantly more than get an annual flu shot. Fussing aside, the H1N1 vaccine campaign has been, and continues to be, a success.</p>
<p>That is good. What is better is the campaign might have reminded those of us lucky enough to be able to take vaccines for granted what modern miracles they are. Vaccines have changed the world. And they continue to do so.</p>
<p>Vaccines are so much a part of the way we do things in Canada that most of us give them very little thought once our children are beyond the childhood immunization stage -- which might explain the out-of-proportion concerns about the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine campaign is not over yet, and Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones is warning Canadians who are not yet immunized not to get complacent. But all our recent focus on this particular vaccine may give Canadians a renewed appreciation for what vaccines have done for us and can do for us in the future. And, more importantly, what they can do for people in parts of the world who don't have the luxury of being complacent about public health.</p>
<p>Just this week, World Health Organization officials began a campaign to immunize 2.8 million Afghan children under the age of five against polio, a disease that has largely disappeared in Canada but which continues to plague some of the poorest countries in the world.</p>
<p>The new vaccine is expected to be used on tens of millions of children in India and Nigeria by early next year. International health officials have been working since the late 1980s to eradicate polio, which a few countries have been unable to shake. The oral vaccine that immunizes against several strains of the disease makes that goal possible. In Uganda, trials are about to begin on a new experimental tuberculosis vaccine -- the first new one to be developed in nearly 100 years. The old one is not very effective any more, and tuberculosis is a growing international scourge that kills one person every 20 seconds.</p>
<p>And work continues, slowly, on the development of an AIDS vaccine. In September, there was excitement over the results of a vaccine trial that seemed to offer some protection against the disease, but that has since been tempered. An effective vaccine is likely still years away.</p>
<p>There are many ways to prevent people from succumbing to deadly diseases, some of them simple. Mosquito nets significantly reduce malaria deaths, condoms significantly reduce AIDS transmission, drugs successfully control many diseases.</p>
<p>But in poor and especially war-torn parts of the world, disease alleviation through drugs and other means is often difficult or impossible. And conditions make people more susceptible to illness. That is where vaccines can have the biggest impact.</p>
<p>Which is why the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, among other organizations, has made vaccine development and access in the developing world a priority. Nearly three years ago Prime Minister Stephen Harper held a press conference with Bill Gates to announced funding support for the global effort to develop an AIDS vaccine. It is good to see the federal support for the initiative.</p>
<p>But Canada can do more. Even as health officials mull over what should be done with the excess doses of H1N1 vaccine stockpiled around the country, Canada has yet to commit to giving extra vaccine to developing countries. The government now says a decision will be made early in the new year. Canada's seeming reluctance to share its excess flu vaccine, as other countries have done, is depressing, especially at a time when Canadians have been reminded of the extraordinary power of vaccines.</p>

<p>TRIAL SURGERY FOR MS WILL UNBLOCK VEINS TO BRAIN</p>
<p>The University of British Columbia is about to launch patient trials, testing a potentially groundbreaking method of diagnosing and treating multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>The study will involve 100 patients and will test the theory that MS can be treated with surgery. MS is the breakdown of the myelin sheath surrounding the axons that carry the electrical signals of the brain and spine. The result is loss of physical and sometimes cognitive ability.</p>
<p>It's one of the first research proposals in Canada to evaluate the findings of Italian doctor Paolo Zamboni whose early studies suggest that MS might be caused by vein blockages that lead to a buildup of iron in the brain.</p>
<p>St. Joseph's Hospital in Hamilton is also testing the theory with a small pilot study of 20 to 30 patients.</p>
<p>ELEVATED INTERLEUKIN 17 COMMON IN SEVERE H1N1</p>
<p>An international study led by Toronto researchers suggests a single molecule could be the key between mild and severe swine flu cases.</p>
<p>Dr. David Kelvin of Toronto's University Health Network says the molecule, known as interleukin 17, may also be the culprit causing severe symptoms in a host of seasonal influenzas and other respiratory ailments like SARS.</p>
<p>Looking at a group of otherwise healthy Spanish patients during H1N1's initial appearance, the study found people with severe symptoms also had elevated levels of interleukin 17.</p>
<p>The molecule helps regulate the body's immune response to viruses and bacteria.</p>
<p>CALLING ART DESIGNERS FOR CONDOM LABEL CONTEST</p>
<p>New York City wants to keep people excited about safe sex, so they're sponsoring a contest for the design of the wrapper for the city's next official condom.</p>

</p>
<p>THE proportion of Manitobans vaccinated against H1N1 flu is on par with Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, slightly behind Saskatchewan and way behind the Atlantic provinces.</p>
<p>In New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador, about two-thirds of the population have already been vaccinated.</p>
<p>In Manitoba, Alberta and Ontario, it's closer to one-third. British Columbia sits at 40 per cent and Saskatchewan's 50 per cent leads the West. Although Winnipeg's H1N1 mass vaccination clinics have now closed, the number of Manitobans getting the needle continues to steadily climb.</p>
<p>As of Dec. 15, more than 430,000 Manitobans had been vaccinated, about 35 per cent of the province's population.</p>
<p>"We're still seeing a number of people coming in to doctors' offices to get their vaccinations," said Dr. Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief provincial public health officer.</p>
<p>He said rural and more sparsely populated communities were initially given higher priority, which might be one reason the Atlantic provinces had higher vaccine uptake.</p>
<p>Kettner would ideally like every eligible Manitoban to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>"I realize that Manitobans have a variety of different reasons for why they are choosing not to get the vaccine," Kettner said. "But this time of year, when people are indoors and meeting new people, it's even more important to get vaccinated."</p>
<p>He notes that a belief the vaccine can do more harm than good and a phobia of needles have kept some Manitobans away from the clinics.</p>
<p>With the worst of the cold winter season still ahead of us, Kettner warned the weather could cause a renewed spike in H1N1 cases. The cold climate can exacerbate chronic illnesses and increase the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of the H1N1 pandemic, Kettner said he's used a variety of analogies to describe the epidemic. Having exhausted hockey and football, he noted that perhaps baseball is the best metaphor for the current H1N1 climate. "In all those other sports, you have time restraints. With baseball, it's over when it's over. These next few months will be a test as to what inning we are in."</p>

</div><div>DAVID EDDIE   </div>

<p>The question</p>
<p>Mistletoe has always been part of my holiday party tradition – it's fun to make people drop a smooch on one another, and I insist my guests do it when they come through the door. My nerdy friends get a little pre-party action and my grouchy pals are forced to lighten up. After I sent out this year's e-mail invite, one of the grouchos hit “reply all” and petitioned the entire guest list to have me eliminate the mistletoe tradition for fear of spreading swine flu. He had a few supporters, too, who kept the e-mail chain going. They were serious. But so am I. I'm keeping the tradition alive this year. No kiss, no entry. Am I setting myself up for an empty dance floor?</p>
<p>The answer</p>
<p>Well, on the one hand I would like to say, on behalf of grouches and nerds everywhere (I'm both), thank you for your philanthropic efforts to “lighten up” our loads and increase our “action” quotient.</p>
<p>You have no idea how badly we need it! Especially the nerds. We never get any! That's what makes (some of) us so grouchy.</p>
<p>Recently, the British etiquette entity Debrett's issued some sort of press release saying a handshake is more likely than a kiss on the cheek to transmit H1N1. So kissing on the cheek under the mistletoe is probably okay this holiday season, as long as you don't touch the person otherwise, except on the shoulder or upper arm.</p>
<p>Which doesn't sound like a whole heck of a lot of fun. But still, better than nothing!</p>
<p>Having said all that (and I can't believe I'm about to say this – in my 20s I would have said that even if the person you want to kiss is on the cusp of passing out, it's socially acceptable to sort of roll that person toward the mistletoe for a little lip-lockage), maybe you should ease up on the mandatory aspect of your mistletoe policy.</p>
<p>You're being a bit of a “kiss bully,” aren't you?</p>
<p>I've never been quite sure how to feel about mistletoe. I do like it, as I've hinted. But anything compulsory in the romantico-sexual arena is a little creepy at the best of times. And especially this year.</p>
<p>I mean, H1N1 is a potentially fatal disease. You don't want anything like that on your conscience, do you?</p>
<p>These days, a lot of people I meet casually (e.g. in the dog park) don't shake hands. They bump fists. I like it, because a) nerdily, I think it's cool, and b) grouchily, I grudgingly appreciate they do it not only to protect their own interests, but mine, and those of my children as well. Vive le fist bump, at least for as long as this “pandemic” lasts.</p>
<p>Likewise, in the interest of preserving your good name, and your health and everyone else's, maybe put a moratorium for the moment on all this kiss-or-you-don't-get-in stuff.</p>

<p>The Maybe option on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> is a digital escape route. It might as well be labelled Don't Have An Excuse Yet.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, when events are created on the social networking platform and invites are sent out, recipients of those invites can say "Yes," "No" or "Maybe."</p>
<p>People are having a harder time saying "no" more than ever. Explanations are expected.</p>
<p>With the digital age well established, we have more tools to find out what's happening than ever before. Ignorance is not a viable excuse.</p>
<p>You can stay abreast of all the local goings-on, but you have a harder time staying home when you're low on funds or feeling lazy, because these are not things we like to share with others.</p>
<p>What has become phenomenally apparent is that there's such an overwhelming pile of great events happening in Windsor any night of the week that we have to dream up more elaborate excuses as to why we're not attending.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s Maybe button allows anyone hoping for a more attractive offer to just pretend they're interested in an event even though they have zero intention of showing up.</p>
<p>"Maybe" has become the cheap and easy way out for truly lethargic, all-talk, arm-chair "culturalists." But it's also been a blessing for those who don't want to say, "I've seen enough this week, and I'm broke."</p>
<p>Some recent excuses I've legitimately used include, "I have Swine Flu," and, "My baby shower is this weekend." Being a supporter of all things culture in this city, I am hard-pressed to give a passable excuse. Even legitimate absences become drenched in guilt.</p>
<p>"Maybe" means nothing. It's a slap in the face of the person trying to bring people together for an event. Dignify the organizer's efforts with a real answer.</p>
<p>"Maybe" is non-committal.</p>
<p>Do I think this article will coax readers to answer future invites with a simple "Yes" or "No"?</p>

<p>Montreal's H1N1 vaccination centres will close after Friday for the Christmas holidays, with more than 4.1 million Quebecers having received the flu shots to date.</p>
<p>Today through Friday, vaccination centres will stay open from noon until 8 p.m. But they will close on the weekend.</p>
<p>On Monday and throughout the holiday period, Montrealers will still be able to get immunized against swine flu by showing up without an appointment at their local public clinic.</p>
<p>"We've vaccinated 46 per cent of the Montreal population and we're hoping to reach 50 per cent," said Monique Laganière, a spokesperson for the Montreal Health and Social Services Agency.</p>
<p>"But I don't think we'll reopen the large vaccination centres after the holidays."</p>
<p>Since the start of the second wave of the H1N1 pandemic, a total of 2,461 Quebecers have been hospitalized, 77 of whom have died.</p>
<p>Children and adolescents have been hospitalized more than any other age group, distinguishing the H1N1 flu virus from non-pandemic strains that tend to affect the elderly.</p>
<p>Most of Quebec's H1N1 deaths have occurred in people who were at least 60 years old, however.</p>

<p>Don't become complacent,</p>
<p>H1N1 could make a huge return</p>
<p>Canadians should avoid becoming complacent about the H1N1 flu virus, which is unpredictable and could stage a big comeback in the new year, says Canada's chief public health officer. In the final federal briefing of the year on the pandemic virus on Tuesday, Dr. David-Butler Jones said a third wave of H1N1 flu could easily sweep across Canada in the coming months. "As we approach the end of 2009, it's tempting to think that perhaps given the numbers, the pandemic's done. This is wishful thinking that can lead to complacency," the head of the Public Health Agency said from Ottawa. TORONTO</p>
<p>Lower Great Lakes water levels blamed on dredging</p>
<p>Navigational dredging along the St. Clair River has contributed to a drop in water levels in the upper Great Lakes basin, but it's not an ongoing problem and doesn't require immediate action, a panel of U.S. and Canadian experts has found. Water levels between Lake Michigan and Lake Erie have declined on average by about 23 centimetres between 1963 and 2006, according to a report by the International Upper Great Lakes Study Board. An increase in the water-carrying capacity of the St. Clair River accounts for seven to 14 centimetres of the decline, but there's been a slight decrease in capacity since 2000, the report said.</p>

<p>Two people seriously injured after fishers pushed into lake</p>
<p>A jury in Newmarket has found a man guilty in an altercation that left two people seriously injured after some fishers were pushed into a lake. Trevor Middleton, 23, was found guilty today of four counts of aggravated assault and two counts of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. Court heard that in September 2007, Middleton and some friends pushed a group of Asian fishers off a dock into Lake Scugog. The prank escalated with one of Middleton's group being severely beaten and a high-speed chase that ended in a crash, leaving one of the fishers with permanent brain damage.</p>

<p>The B.C. government needs to make fighting domestic violence a greater priority, a Victoria police officer said Tuesday after testifying at a coroner's inquest into the murder-suicide of five members of a Victoria-area family. Insp. Clark Russell said Ontario has a specialized Domestic Violence Death Review Committee and Alberta has Canada's first domestic violence threat assessment team. "The province needs to make it a priority and the challenge is the province has lots of priorities," Russell said outside the hearing. Peter Lee, 38, a Canadian navy reservist with some weapons training, stabbed to death his six-year-old son, Christian, his wife Yong (Sunny) Park, and her parents Kum Lea Chun and Moon Kyu Park, before killing himself.</p>

<p>Suspected ring leader pleads guilty to possessing stolen bikes</p>
<p>The suspected leader of a Toronto bicycle theft ring has pleaded guilty to possessing 10 stolen bicycles and to six drug possession charges. Igor Kenk was sentenced Tuesday to 30 months in jail. However, due to time he served awaiting trail, he will serve four more months. Kenk, 50, who operated a used bike shop, was arrested in July 2008. In a series of subsequent raids of his rental garages, thousands of allegedly stolen bikes were seized. There were also a number of drug-related seizures involving cocaine and marijuana. A judge ruled that the public benefited from Kenk's plea bargain, as his business is no longer in operation and bike registration has increased significantly.</p>

<p>Older workers in recession-torn areas to receive retraining</p>
<p>The governments of Ontario and Canada are spending almost</p>
<p>$60 million to retrain 5,000 older workers who live in communities hit by the recession. The two governments are spending a combined $58.5 million over three years to provide training and help finding new jobs for people between the ages of 55 and 64. The money is specifically targeted at hard-hit single-industry towns or areas that are dealing with high unemployment rates.</p>

</p>
<p>Poised to claim their time in the spotlight, destinations around the world are taking centre stage with big festivals or anniversaries, massive new developments, or just particularly good deals. If you're looking to be where the action is in 2010, consider a trip to these destinations.</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>Been waiting for the right time to visit Germany? Then dust off your passport and practice your "Guten Tag!" 2010 stands out as a year chock-full of memorable, unique, and rare events.</p>
<p>For something a little diff erent, how about coal mining complexes turned art and cultural centres? That's what you'll find in the Ruhr, a region once known primarily for coal and steel, which has transformed itself and earned the European Capital of Culture designation for 2010. The 53 cities comprising the region will host more than 300 projects and 2,500 events during the year.</p>
<p>The extravaganzas include "!Sing," a day of song with 65,000 performers; the "Still Life A40," during which a 60-kilometre long banqueting table will be set up along a closed highway and the public invited; and "ExtraShift," an art and performance festival in 40 venues in June.</p>
<p>Once a decade for the last 375 years, villagers in the Bavarian town of Oberammergau put on a play re-enacting the life, death, and resurrection of Christ. The five-hour Passion Play has a cast of more than 2,000 villagers, and attracts an audience from around the world. Tickets to the play, which will be staged 102 times between May and October, are already sold out, but a number of tour operators are still offering packages.</p>
<p>More anniversaries and festivals round out Germany's 2010 offerings. September marks the 200th anniversary of Oktoberfest in Munich.</p>
<p>Leipzig and other cities will celebrate the 200th birthday of composer Robert Schumann with concerts. And Nuremburg's Railway Year, complete with train-themed art, a locomotive parade, and special exhibitions, will honour the 175th anniversary of the country's first train.</p>
<p>Worried about the cost of a Germany vacation? The German National Tourist Board offers tips for keeping costs down on accommodations, transportation, and more.</p>
<p>Singapore</p>
<p>Is Singapore the next Las Vegas or Dubai? New mega-resorts, iconic buildings, and over-the-top entertainment are shaking up the destination's staid reputation. And in 2010, Singapore will host the first Youth Olympic Games.</p>
<p>Three massive projects are set to open in 2010.</p>
<p>A major Las Vegas developer has reached a golden finger across the Pacific to create the Marina Bay Sands, the first casino and resort in Singapore. The resort, set to open this winter, includes three hotel towers topped by a "sky park" with gardens, 360-degree views, restaurants, and a swimming pool. The resort will also house a museum, whose architecture was inspired by the shape of a lotus blossom, as well as a mall with shops, restaurants, cafes, and an indoor canal.</p>
<p>Across from the Marina Bay Sands, big things are afoot at the Fullerton Heritage Complex, a massive waterfront dining, entertainment, and hotel development.</p>
<p>In early 2010, the new boutique Fullerton Bay Hotel will join the refurbished luxury Fullerton Hotel in offering waterfront accommodations close to downtown.</p>
<p>Also opening early in 2010 is Resorts World at Sentosa, a family-centric destination island with a Universal Studios theme park and the world's largest oceanarium.</p>
<p>Hotels on the island will include a Hard Rock Hotel and the Michael Graves-designed Hotel Michael.</p>
<p>An entire island of entertainment won't be the only thing to draw families to Singapore this year. In August, the destination will host the first Youth Olympic Games, drawing young athletes from around the world to compete in 26 events, including track, gymnastics, and swimming. Nearly 400,000 tickets, priced to be aff ordable, will go on sale in March. Each ticket includes a free day of travel on Singapore's public transportation system.</p>
<p>Visitors looking to stop over in Singapore this winter can check out Singapore Air's Stopover special, which includes accommodations and dining discounts, plus attraction and transportation passes.</p>
<p>Iceland</p>
<p>It's no secret that Iceland is a great deal right now. Iceland's currency still hasn't recovered from the economic crisis, and that means a very favourable exchange rate for visitors looking to soak in the Blue Lagoon, hike glaciers, and dance all night. With 10,000 waterfalls, geo-thermal pools galore, and a nightlife and music scene that draws crowds from around the world, there are plenty of ways to stretch each dollar.</p>
<p>While most destinations had fewer visitors last year, Iceland actually welcomed more than in years past. Lonely Planet just named Iceland a top-value pick for 2010, and Travel + Leisure called it one of the world's sexiest affordable destinations.</p>
<p>It used to be that if you wanted to go to Iceland, your choices were to fly <span class="companylink">Icelandair</span> or swim. But that will change in 2010, when Icelandic low-cost carrier Iceland Express debuts seasonal service between New York, Reykjavik, and about two dozen European cities in June.</p>
<p>Mexico</p>
<p>With the H1N1 virus and drug-related violence in its Northern cities, Mexican tourism had a rough 2009. But a big anniversary, a strong dollar, and some of the most affordable hotel rates in years promise a brighter 2010 for travellers to Acapulco, Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, and other popular spots in Mexico.</p>
<p>This coming year, Mexico will celebrate 200 years of independence.</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, Mexico will debut six history routes that follow three military campaigns of the Independence movement and three of the Mexican Revolution. Even if you're not tracing a route, you can still keep an eye out for the "Mexico is My Museum" signs that will identify important points along the routes.</p>
<p>A toll-free number will even offer a short informational message about the location.</p>
<p>If you're considering Mexico in the new year and want to save, let the deals guide your planning. Hotels and resorts around the country are promoting discounts, specially priced packages, and extra amenities thrown in to sweeten the offerings.</p>
<p>The exchange rate still provides more chances to stretch vacation dollars, and should allow vacationers to do more with their money at least through the first half of the year.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>More Places To Watch In 2010</p>
<p>- Istanbul, Turkey: Istanbul celebrates its heritage and vitality as a 2010 European Capital of Culture. Throughout 2010, the city will feature music, literature, theatre, traditional arts, and more.</p>
<p>- Vancouver: The city is mere months away from welcoming the world to the XXI Olympic Winter Games. For the rest of the year, take advantage of tourism infrastructure improvements without battling Olympic crowds.</p>
<p>- Capetown, South Africa: A hot destination for sports enthusiasts in 2010, Cape Town will host the FIFA World Cup beginning in June.</p>

<p>C anadian scientists believe they have found a hallmark danger signal for potentially fatal H1N1 infection.</p>
<p>Working with Spanish scientists, researchers from the University Health Network in Toronto detected high levels of a molecule in the blood of severe H1N1 patients that may trigger runaway inflammation in the airways, and potentially catastrophic lung damage.</p>
<p>The majority of infections caused by H1N1 are mild, but a small percentage of patients develop severe respiratory disease.</p>
<p>"The lungs become just inundated with cells and liquid, and cut off the amount of oxygen that can actually be exchanged," said Dr. David Kelvin, the leader of the Canadian team and a senior scientist at the University Health Network.</p>
<p>The study involved patients infected during the first pandemic waves in Spain in July and August. The team looked at different cytokine mediators. Cytokines regulate the body's immune response. They tell the body when and how to fight infections, such as bacterial and viral infections.</p>
<p>"The one which was most noticeable to us was interleukin 17," which has been associated with inflammation and autoimmune diseases, Kelvin says. "H1N1 severe disease is really an inflammatory disease."</p>
<p>"Most people have a well-balanced and controlled response to H1N1 infection. But in rare cases, individuals have what we think is an uncontrolled immune response. We think that the high levels of IL17 is at the centre of this uncontrolled response."</p>
<p>By targeting or blocking it in the future, "we could potentially reduce the amount of inflammation in the lungs and speed up recovery."</p>
<p>The study involved 20 hospitalized patients, half of whom were admitted to intensive care, 15 outpatients who had mild H1N1 disease, and 15 healthy "controls."</p>
<p>The findings could lead to a simple blood test to identify people at the earliest stages of infection who may go on to develop severe disease, and to a drug to treat people with severe infections.</p>

</p>
<p>After months of urging Albertans to get the H1N1 flu shots -- and weeks of initial complaining by the public about long lineups in the early going -- Premier Ed Stelmach said Tuesday he hasn't yet received his H1N1 vaccination, instead opting for the seasonal flu shot.</p>
<p>While answering the public's questions during his online Ask Premier Ed segment -- which has Stelmach responding to questions on various topics each day this week -- the premier said he's received the seasonal flu shot but hasn't been inoculated for the swine flu.</p>
<p>"I hope to maybe get it this week sometime," Stelmach said.</p>

<p>Wage war on poverty</p>
<p>Poverty could be reduced if companies and businesses paid their employees a living wage, as low-income families who work for low wages face impossible choices -- buy food or heat the house, feed the children or pay the rent.</p>
<p>The living wage movement has gained popularity in the United Kingdom, and across the United States and in a number of Canadian cities. The living wage is high enough that families can weather a temporary crisis without falling into poverty.</p>
<p>Until municipalities and cities in Manitoba pass a living wage people, families will struggle in poverty. Please donate to your local food bank this Christmas, and through the next year.</p>

<p>A boon to bookworms</p>
<p>I'm writing in response to Morley Walker's article Paper cuts (Dec. 12). As a local author who is multi-published with digital publishers and as an avid e-book reader, I just wanted to correct a couple of points in the "cons" part of the article. As far as being able to take your reader to the beach or in the bathtub, a Ziploc freezer bag works perfectly. It's just the right size to hold my <span class="companylink">Sony</span> reader open flat and I can still easily read the screen through the plastic. I've taken my reader to the beach, the pool and into the bathtub.</p>
<p>Also, Walker noted that if you lose your reader you lose your entire library. That may be true of the Kindle, where you download books directly to the Kindle, but I download books to my library on my PC and then transfer them to my reader. Yes, it's an extra step but if I lost my <span class="companylink">Sony</span> reader, I would still have all the digital books I've purchased in my library.</p>
<p>Thanks, Mr. Walker, for helping to increase awareness of e-book readers! The publishing industry is changing rapidly with this new technology.</p>

<p>Don't trust experts</p>
<p>I commend the Free Press for printing Ken McIntyre's letter Not a "real" pandemic (Dec. 12). Having had a family member destroyed by vaccines, I have spent 15 years keeping up with much that's been written about vaccines and the shady and fraudulent way they are produced and marketed. McIntyre is correct in his assessment that H1N1 is not a real pandemic, and the World Health Organization is greatly at fault for this highly overestimated fear-mongering that has taken place. Unfortunately, we cannot trust information presented to us through the media or from our medical authorities, because they have shown us little but confusion in their roles as experts. In fact, fewer people will die from H1N1 than regular flu. So which one is a "pandemic"?</p>

<p>Siloam's mission</p>
<p>I was disappointed with Gordon Sinclair's column about the resignation of Siloam Mission's CEO, John Mohan (A question of transparency and trust for charity, Dec. 12).</p>
<p>Sinclair fails to recognize that in complex situations the interests of all parties must be balanced. Yes, there is a need for transparency in the dealings that charities have with their supporters. But does that necessarily mean that such transparency always trumps the need for privacy in what must be a very difficult personal situation for the Mohan family, regardless of its nature? Or does it mean that full disclosure would actually contribute to a positive outcome for all concerned?</p>
<p>Rather than conjuring up a conspiracy theory and imputing ulterior motives to Siloam, perhaps Sinclair should consider alternative hypotheses. Perhaps the board of Siloam was seeking actually to keep what matters most at the forefront of its actions; not Sinclair's need to know under the guise of transparency, but the continued service of Siloam and other agencies to the homeless and poor of our city. Sinclair's admission that he was "still hot" about this issue reveals more about his motivation for writing this column than anything else he said.</p>

<p>The Goldie touch</p>
<p>One of the brightest stars in the theatrical firmament has gone out with the passing of the great Goldie Semple. I was privileged to work with Goldie in the resident acting company at MTC from 1982-84. As an apprentice actor at the time, I might have been ignored by a star such as Goldie. But no, she was always caring and considerate to everyone, onstage and off.</p>
<p>During a run of Richard III, Goldie and her husband, Lorne Kennedy, knocked on my dressing room door and asked to come in. It was my birthday, and they regaled me with a rendition of Happy Birthday. I'll never forget Lorne playing a little wind-up music box and Goldie singing in her best Shirley Temple voice.</p>
<p>To share a stage with Goldie was magic. To count her as a friend was a gift. Never pretentious, always gracious, ever brilliant. That is why we loved her.</p>

<p>I wish the employees all the best. They have a long battle to get what is rightly theirs. It also proves that they were right to stand and fight for their severance clause and pension.

</p>
<p>One of the scariest aspects of the H1N1 pandemic is the apparent randomness of the virus: While most people who contract it recover from symptoms after several days, pockets of people are hit with extremely severe, and sometimes deadly, illness.</p>
<p>Now, it appears scientists are one step closer to understanding why some people may be at greater risk of developing virulent forms of H1N1, as well as other respiratory illnesses.</p>
<p>Toronto scientists, in collaboration with colleagues from Spain, have identified a molecule they believe is linked to severe forms of illness. The results, published in the December issue of the journal Critical Care, could eventually help health officials target populations that may be most vulnerable, they said.</p>
<p>“It's probably not an isolated example that is specific for H1N1, and it probably spills over to other types of respiratory illness,” said David Kelvin, senior scientist and head of the experimental therapeutics division at the Toronto General Research Institute and one of the study's authors.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at blood samples from 10 H1N1-infected individuals in intensive-care units, 10 patients in non-ICU parts of the hospital, 15 outpatients with the illness and 15 people without H1N1. They focused on analyzing 29 cytokines, or molecules that regulate immune function, to determine if there were any patterns among those with severe forms of the disease.</p>
<p>They discovered that those patients with the most virulent forms had elevated levels of one particular molecule called interleukin 17. High levels of the molecule have previously been associated with inflammation and autoimmune diseases, Dr. Kelvin said.</p>
<p>It's too early to draw a link between high levels of that molecule and the risk of pneumonia or death related to H1N1, he said.</p>
<p>It is still not known if elevated levels of the molecule can predict severe illness, or whether it applies to large groups of people. But the finding does give scientists a solid basis to work with as they continue in their quest to identify what makes certain people more vulnerable to virulent respiratory illness.</p>
<p>Dr. Kelvin said he and his colleagues have been searching for this kind of discovery for years, and they believe it has implications for targeting preventive therapy in future pandemics, as well as seasonal influenza. While they have looked in the past at patients with other respiratory illnesses, they never found a meaningful connection between severe illness and elevated molecule levels.</p>
<p>“This is the first time we've come across something in 10 years, and we've looked pretty rigorously,” Dr. Kelvin said. “It's almost like a smoking gun. If you don't know where to look you'll never get the job done.”</p>
<p>Dr. Kelvin said researchers are expanding their study to look for similar patterns in people living in other countries, such as China. They hope to find links between molecule levels and severe illness, and will look for genetic differences that may make some more susceptible to severe illness.</p>
<p>Eventually, health officials may be able to develop a simple blood test that can identify who is at greatest risk of severe illness in future pandemics or flu outbreaks.</p>
<p>Dr. Kelvin said the work could have major implications for developing countries, which often can't afford comprehensive inoculation campaigns to protect their populations.</p>

<p>You're hosting cocktails for 100 of your nearest and dearest in a week's time. What do you say to the 75 who still haven't bothered to open the Evite? You overhear a party guest announcing he's recovering from swine flu -- and he's standing under the mistletoe. Do you have to pucker up?</p>
<p>Every holiday season brings its own set of etiquette challenges, and this year is no different. Electronic correspondence, whether through <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Evite, e-mail, Twitter or text message, has created the need for a new set of social skills. And this year there's the H1N1 virus, which has made the mini Purell hand sanitizer the holiday season's must-have accessory.</p>
<p>"When we celebrate with our friends and family, we are at our best because we know we are supposed to bring our A-game," says Anna Post, author and spokeswoman for the Emily Post Institute in Burlington, Vt.</p>
<p>That starts with sending a polite invitation. For all but very formal occasions, electronic invitations are acceptable, but experts disagree on the delivery system. Fashion publicist-turned-etiquette enthusiast Cooper Ray, whose website Social Primer specializes in men's manners, considers communications from Evite cheap and those from Paperless Post chic. "I also send out a lot of e-mail invitations," he said.</p>
<p>Thomas P. Farley, creator of the website What Manners Most and a columnist for Pingg who lives in New York, disagrees. "E-mail is the lazy way out."</p>
<p>Whatever form the invitation comes in, it's a guest's responsibility to reply as soon as possible. "You hate to say 'no,' to be a downer, and you think you should hold off until you're sure," Farley said. "But you should treat any electronic invite like you would a paper one and respond right away. You can tick the box that says 'maybe,' which at least gives the host a sense that you got the invite."</p>
<p>Many online invitation sites have features that allow a host to see who has opened an invitation -- and how many times. So don't be a party peeping Tom, lurking in cyberspace until the guest list is up to your standards. And once you've made a commitment to attend, keep it.</p>
<p>Guests are not required to bring anything to a party, but it's a lovely gesture, Post said. "Some people bring a sweet item, a box of chocolates or a bottle of wine," she said.</p>
<p>Once the party is in full swirl, palms are being pressed and cheeks kissed, don't immediately try to banish the biohazards; wait to pull out the Purell until you are in private. And if a guest seems to be under the influence of swine and not wine? "A host should be kind and direct," Post said. "Something like, 'Sarah, you don't look so well. Maybe we should hang out another time.' "</p>
<p>Guests should know when and how to leave. "When you arrive, make sure you make a beeline for the host to say hello. And when you leave, just go," Ray said. "I can't stand people who come up to the host at a rocking party and say, 'We're sooooo sorry we have to leave,' because the implication is how will this party go on without us?"</p>

</p>
<p>B.C. has recorded two more deaths from the H1N1 flu virus in the past week, the provincial health ministry reported yesterday.</p>
<p>Since Dec. 8, there have been 23 new severe cases of H1N1 identified in B.C. -- 16 on Vancouver Island, four in Fraser Health, two in Interior Health and one in Vancouver Coastal Health -- as the virus winds down.</p>
<p>The two new deaths were in Vancouver Coastal Health region.</p>
<p>The majority of lab-confirmed cases in B.C. have been mild or moderate in severity, the province said.</p>
<p>So far in B.C. there have been 51 deaths from the H1N1 virus. Of those cases, 44 had underlying medical conditions while five had no underlying conditions. Two cases are still under investigation.</p>
<p>Nationally, 8,102 people in Canada have been hospitalized with the pandemic virus. Since April, 390 deaths from H1N1 have been reported.</p>

<p>Saskatoon should immediately invest in two new health research facilities to make up ground on a "worrisome" lack of clinical research in the province, says the Saskatoon researcher hired to breathe life back into the field.</p>
<p>"If we want to get into the game ... we need some clinical research infrastructure," says Prof. Beth Horsburgh, who holds a joint senior administrative position with the University of Saskatchewan and Saskatoon Health Region.</p>
<p>Although Saskatchewan is home to three per cent of Canada's population, Horsburgh told the health region's board Monday the province's researchers attract just one per cent of the nation's health research funding.</p>
<p>Saskatoon is a medical and health sciences teaching hub, but it doesn't always act like one, Horsburgh said, and it's time for that to change.</p>
<p>"For about the last 30 years, we've been very preoccupied with day-to-day care, and there's always some (need) in terms of day-to-day care," she says. "If it's not H1N1, it's budget cuts."</p>
<p>But investing in health research is one of the best ways to "get the biggest bang for our buck in terms of better patient care," Horsburgh said.</p>
<p>She's proposing a Saskatoon hospital make room for a clinical trials unit with at least eight beds, where publicly and privately-funded researchers could do some of the early testing on potential new drugs.</p>
<p>The health region and university should borrow $1 million to prepare and equip the unit, Horsburgh told the health region's board, and lobby the government to provide $500,000 to cover possible shortfalls during the first five years of operating the unit.</p>
<p>Based on similar successful Canadian facilities, the unit should be profitable within three to five years, she says. Profitable pharmaceutical and nutriceutical companies are lining up to use such facilities for a fee.</p>
<p>Horsburgh counted 50 U of S researchers conducting 11 clinical trials in 2008. That could easily double within five years if Saskatoon were to open such a unit. If the project were to get funding in January, the unit could be operating by late fall 2010, she said.</p>
<p>Horsburgh's second vision is for a Saskatchewan Centre for Innovation in Health Imaging, or, SCI-HI for short.</p>
<p>Building a new imaging hub, investing in new CT and MRI machines, and maybe purchasing the province's first PET scanner would allow Saskatoon to become a beta-testing site for emerging technologies in diagnostic imaging, she said.</p>
<p>"The idea really is to bring to Saskatchewan some of the best that imaging has to offer, opposed to us leaving the province to get the best of what imaging has to offer," she said.</p>
<p>Although other such sites exist in Edmonton, Winnipeg, Halifax and beyond, a diagnostic imaging network in Saskatoon would be the only one in Canada to include a synchrotron, which has powerful medical beamlines in development.</p>
<p>Such an imaging network would give Saskatchewan patients access to the best new techniques, allow for earlier screening for chronic diseases, and hopefully accelerate the effort (which is already underway) to get the province's diagnostic images completely digitized and online.</p>
<p>Horsburgh points out 80 per cent of Canadian health research money goes to institutes like SCI-HI or the clinical trials unit.</p>
<p>Health research has been "invisible" on Saskatchewan Health's agenda, Horsburgh says, and that has likely hurt the province's ability to recruit and retain doctors. If the province wants good patient care, it needs good doctors, and good physicians want to do research, she says. Any good clinical researchers already here were recruited "by accident, not by plan," she says.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that Saskatchewan is "lagging" in the way it pays doctors, Horsburgh says. When physicians are paid by the number of patients they treat, taking time out to do research eats into their pay.</p>

<p>Re: How Does He Do It?, Dec. 15</p>
<p>John Mraz holds Stephen Harper personally responsible for the few, but tragic, H1N1 deaths in Canada, along with a myriad of other sins, such as cutting the GST to give hardworking Canadians a bit of a break and rightly letting Omar Khadr rot in jail. I suppose he thinks Michael Ignatieff would be doing a better job, but he's a man filled with nothing more than hot air. Unfortunately, the answer to Mr. Mraz's question is pretty basic: More Canadians agree with Mr. Harper and his policies than with Mr. Mraz's party of choice.</p>

</div><div>Vik Kirsch   </div>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health's H1N1 flu vaccine clinics are coming to an end, but there are still opportunities to get immunized, the health unit said Monday.</p>
<p>In fact, Lynn Beath, director of public health and disease prevention, is urging the public to continue to get immunized by their family doctor or at doctors' clinics. She said the flu threat is far from over and some people, such as children and senior citizens with underlying medical conditions, remain vulnerable to coming in contact with those who are not outwardly sick but are carrying the virus.</p>
<p>"We are still strongly encouraging people" to get immunized, Beath said, adding the threat of illness is not to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>"For some people, it can be very serious," Beath said.</p>
<p>That was underscored by the 33 deaths and 307 hospitalizations recorded by the Public Health Agency of Canada for the week ending Dec. 5, the latest statistics available.</p>
<p>The local health unit curtailed most of its community clinics at the end of last week, except for one in Drayton, which is running from 2 to 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at 109 Wellington St. S.</p>
<p>But at certain dates and times, inoculations are offered at board offices until Dec. 22, including 600 Southgate Dr. in Guelph, with information posted at: www.wdghu.org[http://www.wdghu.org]. After that, people can still get shots by making appointments at the board offices.</p>
<p>"This has been a very different flu season," Beath said, noting a strong emphasis this fall on mass immunization of area residents against the pandemic flu version (and to a lesser extent the seasonal variety that strikes every autumn and continues almost into spring).</p>
<p>It's kept the health board and other front-line health workers scrambling for months.</p>
<p>The Guelph General Hospital at one point had 100 staff off sick with the flu (requiring seven days away for each employee to reduce the risk of spreading infection to patients), the facility reported Monday. At the peak, 67 people came to the emergency department with flu-like symptoms, compared to a more typical five to eight a day now. Visits were elevated until a flu assessment clinic opened temporarily near the hospital, though it has since closed its doors.</p>
<p>The public board's efforts included community clinics in Guelph, Fergus, Orangeville and Mount Forest that have now ended.</p>
<p>"We have finished the major thrust," Beath said. "We feel we have at this point captured the vast majority of people who are wanting H1N1 vaccines."</p>
<p>The focus now during remaining clinic days at board offices is on those who need a second dose: children under three who had the first at least 21 days previously, as well as kids under 10 with chronic afflictions or anyone else who now desires to be immunized, she said.</p>
<p>Workplace clinics are also starting up at various employers through their on-site health committees and teams, Beath continued.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Upper Grand District School Board is reporting a drop in absenteeism.</p>
<p>"We have seen reduced activity in illness," communications officer Maggie McFadzen said.</p>
<p>Last week, no elementary schools were over a key indicator of 10 per cent absenteeism, though all 11 secondary schools reported rates still above. Overall, there's an improvement evident in rising attendance numbers, McFadzen said.</p>
<p>The board is continuing to clean schools more vigorously and encouraging better personal hygiene among students and staff.</p>
<p>"We haven't let down our guard or vigilance," McFadzen said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Top 10 health stories: the year in review</b>
</div><div>EVRA TAYLOR LEVY & EDDY LANG   </div>
<div>Freelance</div>

</p>
<p>Who would have imagined that a viral infection in an innocent Mexican boy would lead to a global pandemic with huge public health implications? But there was more to learn about health in 2009 than the impact of the H1N1 virus. This edition of HealthWatch recaps the top 10 stories from a year filled with important scientific developments.</p>
<p>Preventing falls in the elderly. Keeping the elderly from experiencing the downward spiral in health that can occur after falling is nothing short of a balancing act. In fact, preventing falls is a balancing act. Research is showing that specific exercises designed to improve reflexes and stability have important benefits when it comes to preventing falls. General exercise helps as well, but not as much as a program that targets equilibrium.</p>
<p>Exercise benefits cancer survivors. Cancer is being beaten on a regular basis, and cancer survivors abound and are working hard to re-integrate into society. But fighting cancer takes a lot out of a person and while survivors can claim victory, their ability to function does not always return to normal. Fortunately, recovery is aided considerably by a regular exercise program that restores energy and allows the disrupted parts of a cancer survivor's life to fall back into place.</p>
<p>Good news for dieters. Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate diets are viable alternatives to - and may even be superior to - the low-fat, calorie-restricted diet that has traditionally been advised for people needing to shed weight and who may have risk factors for heart attack and stroke. A study showing only small differences between the three approaches is welcome by dieters because this allows them to individualize their choice based on their health profile and personal preferences, increasing the likelihood they will be successful.</p>
<p>Not all cancer screening is good for you. Evidence continues to mount that sometimes, getting screened for cancer can cause more harm than good. Tests lead to more tests and treatments, some of which can be unpleasant and harmful, resulting in treating some slow-growing cancers that would never have threatened one's health. Prostate cancer screening with a blood test, and mammography for 40-year-old women exemplify this. With no convincing evidence of benefit, the decision to get screened becomes an informed personal choice rather than a strong health recommendation.</p>
<p>Eating less may make you smarter. With the "silver tsunami" approaching, the need to find ways to head off the decline in mental functioning that affects so many seniors becomes a top priority. In addition to the convincing benefit of exercise in this regard, new research this year also supported the notion that reducing calories can improve performance on skill-testing questions that are a struggle for the aging brain. Is it time to drastically reduce your caloric intake? Not just yet, but the benefits for your heart and waistline may be other reasons to consider it an option.</p>
<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder: we need to talk. As many as one in 10 of us may develop PTSD in our lifetime, yet the vast majority of cases are undiagnosed and untreated. Not seeking effective intervention leaves PTSD victims unable to fully function, but there is hope. Certain types of talk therapy seem to be the most effective, along with group therapy and peer group support. When it comes to getting help for PTSD, earlier is better. Multiple effective therapies exist, suggesting that taking those first steps constitutes the most important part of the journey toward recovery.</p>
<p>Should tanning beds be put to rest? Scientists from the World Health Organization recently declared tanning beds carcinogenic - cancer-causing - for humans. The most ominous warning related to the use of tanning beds in those under age 30, which raises the risk of melanoma, a common and deadly type of skin cancer, by 75 per cent. What's the bottom line? Tanning beds should be discouraged for those most at risk, especially pale-skinned youth who want a long life ahead of them.</p>
<p>Not all antidepressants are created equal. Most research indicates that depression results from an imbalance in brain chemicals that affect mood and motivation. In one study, Zoloft, one of the best established of the antidepressants in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</p>
<p>(SSRI) class, was shown to be the preferred option initially. But everyone's biology is different and no two people will respond alike to treatment. An individualized approach always trumps the best research evidence and a good dose of patience may be just what the doctor ordered when trying to find the medication that works best for you.</p>
<p>Growth and the ADHD medication Ritalin. Placing a child on ADHD medication can be an agonizing decision, especially in light of the concern that these stimulant drugs may inhibit children's growth and weight gain. Researchers found that while there was a measurable impact on growth, the effect was small and lessened over time. There are no definitive answers yet, so decisions must be made with imperfect information. ADHD medications are meant to be used when non-medical approaches are not effective, and should be used at the lowest possible dose to have their desired effect.</p>
<p>New guide targets addiction. Substance abuse exacts an enormous human toll and is directly linked to more than 47,000 deaths annually. Despite its prevalence, healthcare providers are often at a loss in terms of detecting problems and offering help. A newly published guide from the U.S. National Institutes of Health offers information and advice, examines the root causes of addiction, and outlines 13 core principles of treatment, addressing both the psychological and physical dimensions of the problem.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>What's the point?; Teams get one for an OTL, so shouldn't regulation winners get more than two?</b>
</div><div>Elliott Pap   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>954 words</div><div>15 December 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>C2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Forget the H1N1 virus, there is a bigger epidemic in the National Hockey League called the OTL.</p>
<p>The OTL, or overtime loss, is the official designation for a team that drops a game in the extra period or shootout. You can't win in 60 minutes, you can't win in overtime and you can't win in a shootout but you still get a 'loser point' for not losing in 60 minutes.</p>
<p>It's wacky and, before Monday night's eight-game slate, a whopping 133 'loser points' had already been awarded this season. Dallas led the way with 10, followed by Tampa with nine. San Jose, Anaheim, Florida, the Leafs and Islanders all had seven.</p>
<p>Last season, 282 points were awarded to teams that couldn't win.</p>
<p>Now, we have no problem with the 'loser point' if the NHL deep thinkers feel playing someone even for 60 minutes is worth a reward. Our problem is that some games are worth two points -- that's for the old-fashioned victory in 60 minutes -- and others are worth three when it goes beyond 60. The obvious solution is to award three points for a regulation victory and make all games of equal value.</p>
<p>Traditionalists may scoff at the three-point solution but what kind of tradition is it when 133 points are given to teams that lost? On both Wednesday and Friday last week, 10 Western teams played and eight earned points. Fourteen of 15 teams in the West were 'above .500' on Monday morning.</p>
<p>The loser point has skewed the standings and the only way to counter it is to reward three points for a regulation victory. Funny, when this theory was put to two team captains on the weekend, it received no support. We polled a Canadian, an American, a Finn and a retired goalie and nobody was buying our seemingly sensible solution.</p>
<p>"I don't mind the way it is," said Canuck captain Roberto Luongo before Monday's home date against the L.A. Kings. "Obviously it's not in our favour right now and it's a little frustrating but, you know, that's the way it goes. We have to find a way, when we're down a goal, to bring games to overtime and take it from there.</p>
<p>"It's not helping us right now but that's not the system's fault. That's our fault."</p>
<p>Wild captain Mikko Koivu, the Finn in our little poll, admitted he doesn't spend much time sweating this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>"I don't know about three points for a win, I haven't really thought about it," he said. "I know in Europe they have three points but I like the way it is here. If you get to the shootout, I think for sure you should get one point. Maybe if you lose in overtime, you shouldn't get any."</p>
<p>(Fat chance that would ever come to pass, Mikko, because coaches would order their players to sit back and protect the point through the overtime.)</p>
<p>Ryan Kesler, Canuck centre and impending U.S. Olympian, wasn't the least bit interested in a three-point regulation victory.</p>
<p>"No," he replied emphatically. "That wouldn't work. That's too much like European soccer. Pretty soon, you're going to have 10 points for a win, then 15 points for a loss. I think it works the way it is now. It's hard to win games in the NHL. You battle hard for that one point and I think you deserve it if you tie a game through 60 minutes."</p>
<p>The three-point win would add drama to the standings, not lessen it. If teams desperately needed an extra point to finish first or make the playoffs, they would go all-out in regulation rather than letting it get to OT or a shootout.</p>
<p>Kesler wasn't buying that either.</p>
<p>"I just like it the way it is," he said. "Some teams are going to play a lot of games where they lose in overtime and might make the playoffs because of it. But they worked hard for 60 minutes to get that point."</p>
<p>Retired goalie Kevin Weekes, now a rookie commentator on Hockey Night In Canada, also endorsed the current system but conceded that a three-point regulation victory is at least worthy of discussion.</p>
<p>"I think it's a little bit of a novel concept," Weekes said. "I think it always takes a lot of people in the hockey world to get their heads around something when it comes to change.</p>
<p>"One proposal I heard the other night with regards to the OT situation is maybe go four-on-four, three-on-three, two-on-two, then one-on-one. I think that's pretty neat. I think that's exciting. Not to suggest that the shootout isn't exciting, but I think in this instance teams would play harder and it's a more natural way for teams to try and get that point."</p>
<p>We'll stick to our guns: three points for a regulation win, two points for an overtime or shootout win, one point for an OTL. In our world, all games are created equal.</p>

</p>
<p>"It's over."</p>
<p>That's how a senior provincial Tory described to me his party's chances of winning the next election -- and that was before the Angus Reid poll released Thursday showing the governing Tories 14 points behind the Wildrose Alliance.</p>
<p>My source, who has been in the upper echelons of the provincial Tory party since the Don Getty era, says there is simply no way for the Tories to pull out of the death spiral they are in. "And if there were, count on the current crew to miss the opportunity."</p>
<p>The current provincial cabinet does seem an especially sorry lot. Name a situation and they will pick the wrong course of action, almost without fail. Even when they do pick the right solution, they have a way of turning victory into defeat. Take their rollout of H1N1 vaccine. In the first six days vaccination clinics were open, Alberta Health managed to give shots to 400,000 people. Admittedly, there were long, long lines.</p>
<p>And the shots didn't necessarily go to the right people. The hours-long delays at many clinics were largely the result of the province's inability to recognize that some Albertans needed the vaccinations ahead of others; prioritization of recipients into high-risk and low-risk groups did not take place until more than 10 days after the clinics had opened.</p>
<p>Still, immunizing 400,000 people out of a population of 3.5 million in less than a week should have been seen as success, of sorts. It was far and away the highest per capita immunization rate in Canada. Even if the lack of initial prioritization made that first week of shot giving needlessly chaotic, the provincial government should have pointed with pride to the high number of needles its health workers had given.</p>
<p>"But," said my senior Tory source, who asked not to be named, "they bought their own bad press." Rather than respond to the reports that they had fouled up with counterclaims about the number of Albertans they had managed to inoculate, the government of Premier Ed Stelmach began apologizing profusely, which merely reinforced the perception that they were to blame.</p>
<p>By the time they realized there was a positive side to portray to the public -- shortly after Remembrance Day -- it was too late. Public opinion had galvanized behind the perception that the Tories were insincere dunces, so that everything they said and did after that merely reinforced the public's first impression.</p>
<p>Add to this the Alberta Hospital fiasco and the high-voltage power line fiasco, the deficit fiasco and the royalty review fiasco, and a host of others. None of these would have been easy files to manage, but in each case whatever would have made the situation worse, that was the course of action the Tories chose.</p>
<p>Why on earth, for instance, would they have chosen to single out Alberta Hospital for cost-cutting closures?</p>
<p>Set aside for now the wisdom or stupidity of shutting beds at a psychiatric hospital before a comprehensive network of community supports was in place, the strategic thing to do would have been to disguise closures at Alberta Hospital in among a raft of other cost-cutting measures. Not only would that have made the Alberta Hospital cuts less noticeable, it would have given the hospital fewer friends to come to its aid.</p>
<p>If other departments and institutions were facing their own cuts concurrent with Alberta Hospital's, more public servants would have been reluctant or even unable to come to its defence.</p>
<p>Also, the Tories have suffered from taking a tough stance initially, then seeming to soften, only to harden again as they took a battering from opponents. After the first wave of bad publicity, the Tories seemed to relent. They appeared set to back down on cuts at the province's largest psychiatric facility. Then organized labour began running ads criticizing the move (very effective ads) and the government got its collective back up and resumed its closure plans.</p>
<p>Yet, there has still been no announcement at the hospital of which departments are closing and when or who will be laid off.</p>
<p>My guess is that in the end the Tories will make very few cuts, but will take all the bad publicity full cuts would have warranted. They are such a clueless bunch that they will have endured all the pain with little or no gain.</p>
<p>Similarly, they have gone back almost entirely on their 2008 announcement of higher royalties for the provincial treasury on oil and gas activity. That announcement has all but dried up their donations from the energy sector, and now they won't even receive the greater royalties for which they endured so much criticism.</p>
<p>It's too early for the Wildrose Alliance to start measuring the premier's office, government benches in the legislative assembly and ministers' suites. They still face plenty of obstacles, not the least of which I suspect will be dimbulb eruptions from their own impatient, unsophisticated candidates.</p>
<p>But the Alliance can at least count on the Tories to continue their bullheaded, clumsy and gormless race to the bottom.</p>

<p>Nursing and other new graduates are in for a "tough time" getting health-care jobs in the province for the next two years, the boss of Alberta's health superboard says.</p>
<p>"I would dearly love to increase the number of new grads we take, as these people are our future and we need to make sure we've got a sustainable workforce into the future," Stephen Duckett, CEO of Alberta Health Services, wrote on his blog recently. "I hope we'll be able to increase our rate of employment for these new graduates in the coming years. But it's going to be a tough time for a couple of years."</p>
<p>In August, Alberta Health Services hired 40 per cent of registered nurses who graduated that month. In previous years, the former health regions hired approximately 80 per cent of graduating classes.</p>
<p>That's making new nurses worried, said Anita Molzahn, dean of the nursing faculty at the University of Alberta. "There is considerable concern from faculty and from students, as well as recent graduates," Molzahn said. "Alberta Health Services has been very clear that it's unlikely that many of them will get positions. Many are looking very seriously at going elsewhere. We do know that B.C. and Saskatchewan and Manitoba and the Northwest Territories are all benefiting."</p>
<p>Molzahn said Alberta's health superboard hasn't given the nursing faculties a target number for future hires. "They have said they want to make sure they don't lose a generation of nurses so they've been careful not to give any numbers," Molzahn said. "I worry because we know we have a global nursing shortage and we know that higher numbers of registered nurses result in better patient outcomes. I am concerned, but there are so many questions right now in terms of new models of care. We're just living in times of uncertainty."</p>
<p>Molzahn said she is encouraging nurses to take part-time jobs, positions in areas outside their chosen specialty or head back to school and wait out this latest crisis. "It seems like we go through the cycles, depending on the economic circumstances of society," she said. "Things will shift again. I'm optimistic as the economy improves." Before that happens, Alberta Health Services has to find $1.2 billion in savings to cover a ballooning 2009-10 projected deficit. It could face another $1 billion shortfall next fiscal year, although changes already made -- combining payroll departments, for instance -- is expected to save the health system $650 million annually.</p>
<p>In his blog, Duckett said the system is trying to minimize mandatory layoffs existing staff</p>
<p>"(I) know through my family experience the pain of a compulsory layoff and it is something I want to avoid if at all possible," he wrote. "I'll not promise that there will be no compulsory layoffs -- but we will be really trying to minimize them," in part by saving money with early retirements.</p>
<p>So far, two per cent of the system's employees have applied for the early retirement packages, but few have been accepted since only those who don't have to be replaced are eligible.</p>
<p>Some flexibility is on the horizon with fewer staff being required to deal with the H1N1 pandemic flu, Duckett wrote in his blog.</p>
<p>He also plans to phase out a system that started April 1 that required senior management to approve every new hire before vacant positions could be filled. "Although we've still got these budget challenges in front of us, we need to acknowledge that there's more to life than budgets," his blog reads. Duckett said his next 12 months will focus on waiting list problems, emergency departments, boosting primary care and looking at people's health needs before they reach hospitals.</p>

<p>Today's top stories from Report on Business :</p>
<p>A housing bubble? Not yet</p>
<p>The stunning rebound in Canada's real estate markets continues to prompt speculation about whether a bubble is forming. Today, the Canadian Real Estate Association reported that home sales rose 73 per cent in November across the country, though that's compared with weak numbers at the height of the crisis a year ago, and that fresh records were set in Ontario and Quebec. Nationally, the average price rose 19 per cent to $337,231, compared with a year ago.</p>
<p>In a note titled “It's beginning to look a lot like a bubble,” Douglas Porter of BMO Nesbitt Burns said today: “Before officially declaring this a Bubble with a capital B, we would again painstakingly point out that the reported price change is skewed by the surge in Vancouver and Toronto sales, two of the priciest markets. Using a fixed-weight measure, average home prices in the major markets have risen by a milder 11 per cent [year over year] – still robust, but short of a warning-bell-ringing pace. ? While we don't believe Canadian housing is in full-blown bubble territory quite yet, there is clearly a risk of a blow-off to the high side in the months ahead.”</p>
<p>Record-low interest rates and other government measures are driving buyers, with willing sellers looking at hefty premiums. There are fears that some home buyers taking on debts now may not be able to handle them when rates rise. Economist Sheryl King of Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch said there's no bubble yet but, citing variable-rate mortgages, acknowledged the seeds are there.</p>
<p>But new listings are also on the rise and CREA economist Gregory Klump said rising prices and higher rates next year will cool the market.

<p>Consumer bankruptcies decline</p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe, the recession's toll on the Canadian consumer is easing. While it's never a good idea to make too much of a monthly number, it's still noteworthy that consumer bankruptcies, which have surged since the slump began, fell more than 28 per cent in October. That may be in part because people have been rushing to beat a mid-September deadline on changes to bankruptcy law, but it's still a good sign. Over all, total insolvencies among consumers and businesses in Canada fell 19 per cent from September. According to the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada, it's only the second time in a decade that October insolvencies were below those of September.

<p>Austrian bank troubles latest threat</p>
<p>Troubles in Austria's banking sector and continuing concerns over Greece's credit woes rippled through currency markets today, dragging down the euro against the U.S. dollar. On Monday, the Austrian government nationalized Hypo Alpe Adria, whose soured loans are centred in troubled Eastern Europe, and there is more speculation that other Austrian banks may also need to be rescued.</p>
<p>At the same time, markets aren't buying into promises by Greece's prime minister, George Papandreou, to bring his fiscal mess under control. Despite his pledge Monday to slash layers of government, freeze some salaries and tax bankers' bonuses, investors were selling down the country's debt and financial shares today. Markets have lurched from mini-crisis to mini-crisis, from Dubai to Greece, and now face being rattled by new fears.</p>
<p>“Six months ago, people would have thought ‘it's only Greece' or ‘it's only Austria,'” one currency analyst told Te Wall Street Journal. “Now these things are taken as a reason to sell the euro.” Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/austria-probes-near-demise-of-bank/article1400745/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/austria-probes-near-demise-of-bank/article1400745/])</p>
<p>Dreamliner makes test flight</p>
<p>The 787 Dreamliner got off the ground on its test flight today, a win for Boeing Co. after delays of more than two years. The Dreamliner promises a new era for airlines, with lower fuel and maintenance costs given its plastic fuselage and other titanium parts. Boeing has 840 orders worth about $140-billion (U.S.). “It really sends a message that this is a real program and they have a lot of work to do, but this looks like a real, and very promising, aircraft,” Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia told Bloomberg News. Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/boeing-dreamliner-takes-to-skies/article1400647/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/boeing-dreamliner-takes-to-skies/article1400647/])</p>
<p>Airlines to suffer billions more in losses</p>
<p>First there was SARS, then surging oil prices, then a recession, and then H1N1. The global airline industry hasn't had it easy. Today, the International Transport Association warned the industry is expected to lose $11-billion (U.S.) this year, and it upped its forecast for next year's losses to $5.6-billion. Still, IATA head Giovanni Bisignani said today that the worst is probably over, and some key indicators are pointing “in the right direction.” Nonetheless, the group's chief economist told reporters he believes high debt levels among North American consumers in particular “will limit air travel for probably a number of years.”</p>
<p>What's next for U.S. banks?</p>
<p>Are America's banks now strong enough to stand alone again? Yesterday marked the official end of the U.S. government's bank bailouts as Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. announced plans to repay the money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, and raise money through stock sales. The major U.S. banks were anxious to get out from under the government's largesse, which also came with pay restrictions, after the massive bailout at the height of the financial crisis. Despite the raging controversy over bankers' bonuses, there are legitimate competitive concerns for banks that want to retain top talent.</p>
<p>There are other theories on why the banks want out, as well. Analysts note that mortgages and commercial real estate loans could spark big losses next year. And banks such as Citigroup that are deep in consumer lending must contend with the potential for soured loans given that unemployment is not expected to ease any time soon. “It may be as much about raising capital as it is paying off TARP,” FBR Funds portfolio manager David Ellison told The New York Times.</p>
<p>Other observers told the newspaper they worry that the Obama administration may be erring by letting the banks out of the program too soon. Another shock, on sovereign credit, say, could send them back to the trough, they say. “The guarantee is no longer explicit, it's implicit – just like the implicit guarantee for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,” former U.S. Federal Reserve Board official, and now bank analyst, Dino Kos told The Times. “This is the nature of the ‘too big to fail' problem.”</p>

<p>Bank of America may tap insider</p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. is now expected to tap someone from inside the bank as its next CEO to succeed Kenneth Lewis, who is leaving at the end of 2009. The bank had reportedly been in talks with Robert Kelly, a Canadian who now heads Bank of New York Mellon Corp., but he dropped out. Bloomberg News this morning suggests the search committee may tap Gregory Curl, the bank's chief risk officer, or Brian Moynihan, chief of consumer banking.</p>
<p>Markets await the Fed</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar rose today as markets speculated on when the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will begin to unwind the unprecedented measures it took to fight the economic crisis. The U.S. central bank begins a two-day meeting and is widely expected to signal no change to its benchmark lending rate tomorrow afternoon, but markets are looking for hints of what lies ahead. Like the Bank of Canada, the Fed has pledged to keep interest rates at historic lows for some time yet.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow's release of the FOMC statement will prove important and could put an end to this spurt of [U.S. dollar] strength,” Scotia Capital said today. “For now we continue to believe that the economic backdrop is too fragile to implement aggressive interest rate hikes, unemployment at 10 per cent and contained inflation do not lay the foundation for near-term policy tightening. This combined with global policy makers' ongoing commitment to support growth (at almost any cost) should see the [U.S. dollar] close 2010 at lower levels than it will close this year.”</p>
<p>The Financial Times reported that there's an “outside chance” the central bank could change other programs while the benchmark Federal funds rate untouched.

<p>China IPOs rise</p>
<p>In yet another sign of China's growing might, the country has again eclipsed the United States in terms of initial public offerings. Dealogic, a research company, said IPOs in Hong Kong and mainland China have brought in almost $52-billion (U.S.) this year, compared to about $26-billion in the United States.

<p>WINNIPEG</p>
<p>It was puppy love versus the H1N1 flu for nine-month-old Ellica Martin.</p>
<p>Puppy love won.</p>
<p>Ellica may have cried on Wednesday when the needle for H1N1 was poked into her leg, but her tears soon turned to fascination when she came face to face with a dog's furry face.</p>
<p>Ellica was just the latest child to meet and be comforted by Lucky, a four-year-old Australian shepherd-border collie cross.</p>
<p>Lucky, with her owner Lucy Johnston, was volunteering with St. John Ambulance at the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's mass immunization clinic at the Indo-Canadian Arts and Cultural Centre.</p>
<p>Ellica's mom, Angela, said the presence of Lucky -- who sat in the chair beside the baby while she got the shot -- meant fewer tears were shed than after her first H1N1 shot a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>"The dog helped her," she said a few minutes after her daughter was reaching out and touching the dog's black, white and brown fur.</p>
<p>"We have two dogs at home so it is something familiar for her. And it's definitely good for the older kids -- and good for the parents bringing them in. It makes for a little bit less stress."</p>
<p>Johnston said she's seen the canine's positive effect on children who have been immunized in the seven weeks of the mass immunization campaign.</p>
<p>"She's a distraction for them," she said. "They can pat her. They can look at her when they get the needle. It helps them."</p>
<p>Andrea Herbert-Lugsdin, a nurse at the clinic, said she sees the dog helping kids cope with their nervousness.</p>
<p>"It's nice the kids associate something nice with having a needle," Herbert-Lugsdin said.</p>
<p>Nearby, six-year-old Alyssa McCaughan, also fresh from having her needle, said the dog stayed with her while she got the shot. "It was nice to see a dog here," she said. "I was ready to get the shot anyway."</p>
<p>Christine Kaskiw, St. John's director of community services, said they have 200 dogs and volunteers throughout Manitoba, Nunavut and Northwest Territories.</p>
<p>"The dogs and the volunteers donate their time," Kaskiw said. "We're very honoured to give back to the community at this time."</p>
<p>WRHA spokeswoman Heidi Graham said the need for people to be immunized for H1N1 remains strong, even as it winds down the mass immunization clinics. Graham said people will be able to get immunized at smaller community clinics that are planned.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>How does he do it?; A frustrated liberal can't understand why Canada doesn't hold Stephen Harper to account</b>
</div><div>John Mraz    </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>846 words</div><div>15 December 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>Stephen Harper had an exceptional run. He survived the threat of an opposition coalition by a single vote (the Governor-General's) -- assuring Canadians his continued brand of peace, order and good government. And what continuity we've enjoyed.</p>
<p>Faced with a catastrophic economic collapse, he prudently readjusted his ideological sights and his "no deficit" mantra, and injected billions of borrowed dollars into the economy, seemingly without suffering any loss of support from his conservative base. Along the way, the HST was negotiated and sold to Ontario and B.C., where efficiencies and jobs will apparently spring like tulips next year. Huzzah.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this spring's closure of the Chalk River nuclear facility, resulting in a global shortage of medically essential isotopes is all but yesterday's news. This autumn, the H1N1 pandemic killed dozens, but not thousands, and has been mostly forgotten by the mainstream media. What luck for the dying.</p>
<p>Then, to any oil baron's delight, hacked emails from a British environmental think-tank suggested that eco-spinners were exaggerating the magnitude of climate change, which re-energized 18th century industrialists everywhere. Ergo, Canada is somewhat off the hook for its complete lack of environmental policy or action. Harper's mere attendance at Copenhagen, it seems, is policy and action enough.</p>
<p>On the international front, Omar Khadr, an alleged terrorist, remains incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay. And while some Afghan detainees may have been tortured upon release to local authorities, there is little hard evidence; and in any event, the Taliban are not particularly sympathetic victims. Somewhat like civil servants.</p>
<p>The fact is, you'd never know Harper holds but a minority, but there it is. Our loyal opposition, meek, divided and self-interested, dithered through 2009, spending as much time rebuilding their sand-castles and squabbling as they did holding Harper to account. Meanwhile, Stevie sang their praises on his piano. Can we blame him?</p>
<p>The man knows how to get his message out: Witness his government's insistence that criticism of torture is equivalent to taking sides with the Taliban. These days, it seems if you say it loudly enough, it must be true. Propaganda has reached a new low -- and all the Conservatives' political opponents stand in the crosshairs: bureaucrats, the media, activists, dogs, cats, you name it. Right now, the Conservatives govern by functional majority -- and almost everyone seems scared to get in their way.</p>
<p>We shouldn't be. Here are some facts to remember, for the benefit of those who are still interested in democracy.</p>
<p>The proposed coalition between the NDP and the Liberals, with confidence support from the Bloc, was neither illegal nor unconstitutional. No matter how loudly anyone says it was. It might have been foolish, unwieldy or even unworkable -- but similar coalitions have been formed in Westminster parliaments around the world, and I have no idea why our Governor-General saw fit to prorogue parliament and deny Canadians their democratic rights.</p>
<p>With respect to the economy, Harper assured us little folks as late as the last election that Canada would never run a deficit on his watch. Let alone weather a recession. So he cut the GST by two points (benefiting the rich) and depleted our reserves. The last time I checked, the projected deficit was over $50-billion -- and Canada's Economic Action Plan seemed more an opportunity to build big signs promoting Harper's party and hand out game-show sized cheques than an organized attempt at economic recovery. No one, not the Conservatives, the Liberals, economists or anyone else, seems to know how much of the dough allocated has actually hit the street. Or what benefit has resulted. But the fact that the term "jobless recovery" is now ubiquitous fiscal-speak gives us a pretty good hint how well the whole thing is working.</p>
<p>Our top public health policy experts assert that Canada remains unprepared for a pandemic to this day. No triumph for Harper there. Thousands of venerated scientists assert that climate change is real--and pushing the planet to its brink. A few bad apples on the green side do not make the problem any less real. Canadian Omar Khadr is innocent until proven guilty, like him or not -- just as you would expect to be, no matter your age, origin or family history. Afghan detainees are innocent until proven guilty, and their possible torture with our complicity is not only a crime but a violent reversal of Canadian traditions of humanity and compassion. And accusing veteran civil servants of falsity, while hiding behind the faux-patriotism of the chicken-hawk is loathsome.</p>
<p>Those are the facts. Inconvenient, aren't they?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Millions of doses left over; Provinces ponder what to do with surplus H1N1 vaccine</b>
</div><div>Chantaie Allick    </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>987 words</div><div>15 December 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>As H1N1 flu clinics continue to close across the country and with decrease demand for shots, governments and health officials are dealing with an unexpected surplus of vaccine --although few provinces have determined what they will do with the millions of leftover doses.</p>
<p>The federal government has distributed a total of 24.6 million adjuvanted and unadjuvanted doses of vaccine to the provinces. Fewer than 13.8 million doses have been administered. Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said the federal government and World Health Organization are talking about what to do with surplus vaccine doses. There is no national plan in place yet to deal with the extra vaccines, he said.</p>
<p>The federal government recently announced declines in demand for the vaccine and most of the provinces have noted a decrease in the severity and impact of the virus, including fewer positive tests for H1N1. The number of deaths and hospitalizations related to the flu are dropping across the country, Dr. Butler-Jones said. These numbers have declined steadily for weeks.</p>
<p>British Columbia's provincial health officer, Perry Kendall, said, "We don't have a plan as yet. There are a number of potential options and I don't know which option will be landed on."</p>
<p>Mr. Kendall added, "Until we've made a decision around how many doses we'll need and how many should be stockpiled I don't think we have any sense of what the direction will be."</p>
<p>Options include keeping extra doses for next year (although the vaccine only has a one-year shelf life), seeing if some can be sold on the market, or making a donation to a developing country according.</p>
<p>Both Quebec and B.C. said they expect to have surpluses since less than 100% of their populations will receive the vaccine. Other provinces have said it is too early to tell and continue to focus on getting as many people vaccinated as possible.</p>
<p>"We are very well stocked with vaccines, we don't want our supplies sitting in cold storage, we want to get as many doses as possible into as many arms as possible as soon as possible," said Dr. Arlene King, chief health Officer of Ontario. "Right now, there are no plans to recall vaccine," added Dr. King. She said that vaccinations will continue to be administered in Ontario until at least spring and the end of flu season.</p>
<p>Those provinces that have begun to address the issue vary in how they plan to proceed. Alberta will simply send any additional vaccines back to the federal government while Saskatchewan, like most other provinces, is waiting to hear what comes of national consultations between the provinces and the federal government before deciding on a course of action.</p>
<p>"There is a national conversation happening including the Public Health Agency of Canada to discuss a strategy around what to do with the excess vaccine. We are participating in those conversations and will use that as a decision-making tool," said Karen Hill with Saskatchewan public health.</p>
<p>According to representatives of the Public Health Agency of Canada, the federal government is reviewing a number of options.</p>
<p>"Once we are confident that we have enough vaccine in Canada to meet current needs and potential future contingencies, we will announce our decision. We cannot predict what H1N1 flu activity will look like over the coming weeks, and therefore we continue to encourage Canadians to get vaccinated. We will keep enough H1N1 flu vaccine in Canada to immunize everyone who wants and needs it now, and over the next month," the agency said in a statement.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>More patients strain SHR budget; Growing population means more hospital visits</b>
</div><div>The StarPhoenix</div>

</p>
<p>An increase in the number of hospital patients is nudging the Saskatoon Health Region over-budget.</p>
<p>Seven months into its fiscal year, the health region was about $3.9 million in the red, the region's board heard Monday.</p>
<p>Deb Rhodes, vice-president of finance and administration, explained the current shortfall is only about 0.5 per cent of the region's $804-million budget for 2009-10.</p>
<p>However, the overrun does not include any of the costs the region has incurred for pandemic planning or the additional costs associated with treating or vaccinating patients with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Rhodes estimates those costs are $3 million so far -- about $1 million spent on equipment, such as ventilators and beds, and about $2 million in operating costs.</p>
<p>Although there have been some preliminary discussions with the provincial Health Ministry about how those extra expenses will be funded, Rhodes said the region has yet to receive any commitment in writing from the provincial government.</p>
<p>"We do believe that there will be some level of financial support," Rhodes said. "Until the province actually sees what (the cost) adds up to across the entire province, I don't think they will make any assurances. We're keeping them well-updated."</p>
<p>The deficit already on the books can be attributed to an increase in the number of patients, Rhodes said, adding Saskatoon hospitals are caring for 25 more patients at a time than they have for the past couple of years.</p>
<p>There's been a 5.4 per cent increase in "patient days" so far this fiscal year, she says.</p>
<p>"Luckily, with the recruitment of some additional nurses, we've had the staff available to run those additional beds, but it has put some pressure on us from a financial perspective," Rhodes said.</p>
<p>The increase likely comes from Saskatoon's burgeoning population as well as the growing number of elderly people.</p>
<p>About $2 million of the overrun can be attributed to vacation pay the region owes to workers, should they choose to quit and cash that time in without taking their owed vacation days.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Public urged to get H1N1 shots; Fewer men than women getting vaccination: doctor</b>
</div><div>Janet French   </div>
<div>The StarPhoenix</div>
<div>718 words</div><div>15 December 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>Saskatoon's chief medical health officer is challenging young and middle-aged men to stop being such chickens and roll up their sleeves for the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>As of last week, 27 per cent of men aged 18 to 64 in the Saskatoon Health Region -- compared to 41 per cent of women in that age group -- had been immunized against the virus, the region's board heard Monday.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure how much of this is men thinking they're invincible or being scared of the needle," chief medical health officer Dr. Cory Neudorf told the board.</p>
<p>Although a second wave of the virus may be on a downward swing, Neudorf said this is no time for the public to get complacent about vaccination. With flu strains such as H1N1, there is often a third, fourth or even fifth wave of outbreak before people have built up immunity to the virus, he said. Although the mass immunization clinic at Prairieland Park is set to close at 6 p.m. Thursday, Neudorf said the region must be ready to open another such clinic in the future, should the number of infections surge again.</p>
<p>As of Sunday, the overall H1N1 immunization rate in the health region was 43.4 per cent, or about 129,000 people vaccinated. Neudorf said he wants to see at least 50 per cent of region residents vaccinated, if not 60 or 70 per cent.</p>
<p>Neudorf said he's pleased with the immunization rates among preschool and elementary-aged children, who were among the first targeted groups to be eligible for the vaccine. About 68 per cent of city preschoolers and 72 per cent of rural children under five in the region got the shot. Similarly, 69 per cent of elementary kids in the city and 71 per cent in rural areas were also vaccinated.</p>
<p>Neudorf said he's pleased the region concentrated its initially limited vaccine supply on children first, because research is showing children are among those most likely to spread the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Middle years and high school students had lower rates of coverage (48 per cent in the city and 53 per cent in the country), and adults 18 to 64 had the lowest coverage rates, with about one-third in the region getting the shot so far.</p>
<p>Seniors were more enthusiastic, with 52 per cent in the city and 51 per cent in rural areas receiving the vaccine.</p>
<p>As the Prairieland clinic's days are numbered, Neudorf is appealing to healthy adults to get immunized. After Thursday, H1N1 and seasonal flu shots will be available at public health clinics by appointment and at some private doctors' offices and workplaces.</p>
<p>Neudorf said despite a dip in the number of cases, H1N1 is still circulating in Saskatoon at a higher rate than the seasonal flu. Flu viruses thrive when temperatures are frigid, like they have been in Saskatchewan, and people are spending most of their time indoors -- particularly now at crowded shopping malls and holiday parties. Also, the region has found between 20 and 30 per cent of people with moderate or severe flu symptoms tested were positive for the pandemic strain, meaning the other 70 to 80 per cent had something else and are not necessarily immune to H1N1.</p>
<p>The region must now focus on getting healthy adults vaccinated, "especially the males who can't seem to muster the courage to get a needle," Neudorf said.</p>
<p>Neudorf also pointed out some geographical differences in immunization rates. Rural residents seemed more inclined to get the H1N1 shot than urban dwellers. Residents in the St. Louis and Domremy area had the highest vaccination rate in the region, at 71 per cent, and the Rosthern area had the lowest, at 39 per cent.</p>
<p>There was also variation among Saskatoon's neighbourhoods. Despite targeted clinics in inner-city areas, some neighbourhoods on the west side, in the city centre and areas with large populations of students had immunization rates as low as 28 per cent. Other neighbourhoods had up to 56 per cent of residents immunized, Neudorf said.</p>
<p>So far, at least 14 deaths in Saskatchewan have been linked to H1N1.</p>

<p>Manitobans appear to be losing interest quickly in protecting themselves against the H1N1 pandemic virus and for obvious reason: Although it spreads quickly and makes some people very ill, the virus has not had the virulence that immortalized the plagues of the past. Many people feel very little threat from H1N1.</p>
<p>That may be a problem in two ways. First, if the flu infections surge again, the low rate of immunization puts people at risk. Second, if the pandemic peters out, there will be a whole lot of expensive medicine sitting around in the provincial warehouse as the best-by date approaches. Every crisis presents opportunity and this pandemic experience is instructive, particularly for pandemic and emergency planners.</p>
<p>Manitoba last summer signed a contract with the federal government and vaccine producer GSK to buy 1.3 million doses of vaccine. There is no escape clause; Manitoba is committed to paying for the entire order.</p>
<p>Provincial emergency planners are not second-guessing the decision made early to order enough doses to cover the whole population, including non-Manitoban residents. In an abundance of caution, it was decided it would be better to be holding surplus than to be caught short, especially if demand rose out of fear or if the pandemic turned virulent.</p>
<p>Public health planners say we are not out of the woods yet on H1N1. According to them, Manitoba remains at the peak of pandemic activity, based on hospitalizations, ER visits, ICU admissions and reports from community sources, such as nursing homes. But the week of Nov. 30 saw only 40,000 doses of vaccine administered in Manitoba, a dramatic drop compared to three weeks earlier, when 50 per cent more were administered in Winnipeg clinics alone.</p>
<p>Now, with less than 35 per cent of Manitobans vaccinated, this province is cutting the number of clinics while it holds in store 440,000 doses. It is scheduled to take delivery of a whole lot more. At present, no one is thinking of finding a new market for the surplus -- a third wave of H1N1 could send unvaccinated Manitobans scurrying to their doctor's offices for a shot yet.</p>
<p>Along with rethinking the wisdom of using a sole vaccine supplier and of leaving children, the main source of transmission of H1N1, out of the early target group for vaccination, Canadian pandemic strategists should consider negotiating future contracts with flexibility. An option to halt or slow delivery to reflect the circumstances ought to be included, giving the manufacturer the opportunity to look for other buyers around the world, in countries that may be starting to see the virus arrive.</p>
<p>The total cost of the vaccine includes its administration, and so a hefty portion of the $16 million Manitoba budgeted will be unspent if people stop coming in for vaccination. It would be a terrible waste, however, if, as the threat waned here, the surplus doses of vaccine sat in storage, past their "shelf" life of 18 months.</p>
<p>Provincial officials should be starting to identify other countries to take the unused vaccine. They could include developing nations, which may be very grateful, indeed, to benefit from the affluence that allows some countries the privilege of learning lessons that take only a monetary toll.</p>

<p>(From the Montreal Gazette, December 15, 2009) The Monday Calendar item in yesterday's paper about Hanukkah ending on Saturday was accompanied by a photograph of a seven-branched menorah. Although the menorah is one of the oldest symbols of Judaism, it is not, in fact, the candelabrum used during Hanukkah. The illustration that should have appeared was one of a Hanukkah menorah, or a hanukkiah, which has space for eight candles in a row, one for each of the eight nights of the holiday, and a ninth for the shamash, the helper candle used to light them. The Hanukkah menorah often has a nine-branched design. The Gazette regrets the error. ***** </p>

<p>It's easy to explain why Santa appears in more than one place in the run-up to Christmas, he says: St. Nicholas got so busy when he started bringing gifts to children and became known as Santa Claus that he asked relatives to help him spread the holiday joy and now, the big guy has descendants and helpers such as Trolli all over the world.</p>
<p>"I come from a long line of Nicholases, all who wore the red suit," says Trolli, who "summers" in Philadelphia and first donned the suit 26 years ago.</p>
<p>He spent two decades as a "designer-bearded Santa" with faux-whiskers before growing his own four years ago, and that authentic touch is more in demand for Santa's public appearances these days.</p>
<p>"Being a real bearded Santa, it makes a big difference because I can say, 'Go ahead, tug on that beard,' as much as it hurts," Trolli says, chuckling. "It's a little bit different because now you're Santa all year long."</p>
<p>It's a joyful job, he says, but not without occupational hazards.</p>
<p>This Christmas season arrived with concerns of H1N1, he says, so AORBS' 900 members around the world are discarding germ-prone white cotton gloves, nestling bottles of hand sanitizer next to Santa's chair and dry-cleaning their suits more often. And while Santa's red plush keeps him warm flying through the winter night, Trolli has learned it's less comfortable visiting with children indoors.</p>
<p>After one near-fainting incident, he now wears a cooling vest filled with frozen gel-packs under his suit.</p>
<p>Peter Boxall, who spends 10 hours a day greeting children at a mall in Brampton, Ont., just outside Toronto, starting in mid-November, thinks about icebergs to mentally cool himself down. In 11 years playing the role, he's learned that anti-frizz hair products keep his beard in top form, two years old is when "crying is always on the edge" for children visiting Santa and you're never too old for a Christmas wish.</p>
<p>"One occasion, I had a couple get engaged on my lap. She sat on the left and he sat on the right and they just talked a little and I talked and he did some fumbling and whipped out a ring and asked her," he says. "I had a 93-year-old lady yesterday come and have her picture taken. We talked and she said she hadn't sat in Santa's lap for a long time and I said, 'Well, it's about time you got back to it!' "</p>
<p>According to University of Manitoba professor Gerry Bowler's book, Santa Claus:A Biography, Santa first appeared at a department store in 1841 when J.W. Parkinson in Philadelphia advertised "the real personage in the very act of descending a chimney," though it's unclear whether that was the jolly man in the flesh or a cardboard image.</p>
<p>David Goss, author of 14 books on New Brunswick history, says Santa's first store appearance in Canada was at Saint John department store Manchester Robertson Allison in 1887, and his arrival caused such an uproar the police had to be called to disperse the crowd.</p>

<p>It didn't quite work out the way he intended, but a reckless one-sentence ultimatum from Michael Ignatieff defined the person, the party and ultimately his popularity for the entire fall session of Parliament.</p>
<p>"After four years of drift, four years of denial, four years of division and discord-- Mr. Harper, your time is up," the Liberal leader harrumphed on Sept. 1. After four months of discussion, rarely has a political statement proven to be so laughingly wrong.</p>
<p>By making the declaration without the approval of his MPs, he was shown to be a self-absorbed leader. By sending the country careening toward its second election in less than a year, Mr. Ignatieff defined himself as a shameless opportunist.</p>
<p>By not advancing a compelling reason to justify a snap vote, Mr. Ignatieff portrayed himself as an empty alternative.</p>
<p>The public response was not surprising. Since he had disappeared for the entire summer, their first impression of Mr. Ignatieff was entirely negative. His polling numbers went into a free fall from an approximate tie with the Conservatives to a basement below the approval level for hapless former leader Stephane Dion.</p>
<p>That's when the wheels really started falling off.</p>
<p>After taking it on the chin with a blitzkrieg of attack ads paid for by the Conservatives, Mr. Ignatieff limply responded with his own commercials, portraying himself as a policy wonk in casual clothes against a forest backdrop that turned out to be located in Metro Toronto.</p>
<p>Stung by the media-christened nickname of Iffy, he played leadership hardball in arbitrating a Quebec riding nomination decision, only to lose Quebec lieutenant Denis Coderre in a reactionary huff, who went down while declaring his leader brainwashed by too many Torontonians.</p>
<p>After denying any such thing, Mr. Ignatieff cleaned out all the loyalists who brought him back from his nomadic globe-trotting and they all returned to, um, Toronto.</p>
<p>Amplifying the damage caused by those developments, Mr. Ignatieff endured a scathing <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>-posted analysis of his party's fickle behaviour by Mr. Dion's spouse. There was talk of defections, the mutter of mutiny and a series of discouraging by-election results to shrug off.</p>
<p>At any point Mr. Ignatieff could have been forgiven for writing off the Liberal leadership as a failed academic exercise and returning to the ivory tower. He has wisely decided to surrender instead.</p>
<p>The undeniable ascendency of Prime Minister Stephen Harper is more than just a matter of enhanced personal popularity played out to the tinkle of piano keys while singing a Beatles classic.</p>
<p>This is the dawning of the age of acquiescence, a de facto majority rule by a minority government that wants an election but can't persuade all three opposition parties to accomplish the mission. So they will govern by whim and iron will until they are taken down.</p>
<p>Peter Donolo, Mr. Ignatieff's new chief of staff, has decreed that the Official Opposition will no longer serve as an election-threatening Conservative antagonist. Unless the polling numbers rebound, it seems likely the Liberals won't even vote down Stephen Harper in next spring's budget.</p>
<p>But Mr. Harper's majority-flirting popularity level is even more surprising because the government has been whacked by a series of issues effectively raised by the Liberal bench.</p>
<p>The Official Opposition's research showed irregularities in the government's stimulus spending habits.</p>
<p>There were many signs -- and not just the ones hoisted on signposts by the federal government -- that the handouts were selectively targeted at Conservative ridings. That sense of tax-dollar entitlement was best illustrated by oversized publicity cheques for infrastructure projects sporting Conservative logos or MP signatures that are now under an ethics probe. Even so, the public yawned it off the radar screen.</p>
<p>The government's readiness for the H1N1 pandemic had the potential to fill a Conservative body bag or two in the next election. The Liberals furiously denounced the late order for vaccines from a single source and warned hospitals were overflowing as the rollout ran into production slowdowns.</p>
<p>But the pandemic appears to have fizzled, hospitals have not filled with life-threatened flu victims, the vaccination clinics are starting to close due to lack of interest. There hasn't been a lead question on swine flu in the Commons for weeks now.</p>
<p>Now comes the detainee abuse kerfuffle. This is not an attack on soldier behaviour, as the Conservatives allege. It's about the government's secretive, obstructionist conduct with key ministers using the soldiers as cover from Opposition fire.</p>
<p>But the government tactic seems to be working and the issue will languish now that the Christmas recess has sent MPs scurrying back to reality for six more weeks.</p>
<p>Like everything else this year, every break has gone the Conservatives' way. Even Liberals admit they have recorded their second annus horribilis in a row this year. Their only comfort is that 2010 can't possibly get much worse.</p>

</p>
<p>I awoke yesterday only to be assaulted by the sight of one of my wife's fearful cats, in this case Pericles, licking his groin area in a desultory fashion. If that indignity does not stop all thoughts of tea and marmalade, then you are a barbarian of the first order.</p>
<p>It became worse when Kitty, my wife of some 40 years, rushed in and planted an enormous kiss on the cat's lipless mouth, and then demanded the same from me. I demurred, citing H1N1 and all that, but was thanked with a bejewelled hand smacking my ear and thus starting my day off with severe swelling and tintinnabulation.</p>
<p>I try to think kind thoughts of my dear wife, because I would be semi-lonely without her and would likely freeze in the dark as I have been known to miss the odd deadline or two on the bill-paying side of life. As someone once said, "Behind every successful man stands an astonished wife."</p>
<p>Let us face it, chaps, we are not held in high esteem around the home corral by our lady folk. Why is that?</p>
<p>"Familiarity breeds contempt" fits the bill, I suppose, yet many marriages are successful, as I would like to think mine is, although perhaps less so at this particular moment with my ear still ringing.</p>
<p>The Brigadier has an opinion on this and most else, but his thought was -- follow me closely -- one should never be seen by the wife in one's underwear.</p>
<p>He claims the root cause of his first three marriages disintegrating was veiny legs shooting out of loose Stanfields. Many of the mems were surprised at this revelation, for there had been a school of thought that leaned toward his hairy back as the reason. Nevertheless we mulled over his thoughts on the subject as the fresh martinis came into view.</p>
<p>The one-armed colonel felt that no one looked good in undershorts, especially as the years passed by, for the wedding tackle became leaner and more unruly. While agreeing with the Brigadier in general, he felt strongly that separate commodes were mandatory, otherwise a lasting barrack-room closeness would encompass the once blissful marriage, for which there is no known cure.</p>
<p>I cast my mind back to my army days and remembered Rifleman "Piggy" Farmer at the sink next to mine and realized that the colonel was spot on, for the things I witnessed Piggy do in that WC put me off close quarters for life.</p>
<p>A deputy minister two down from me on the right chirped up with a thought on his wife's eating habits, as in they were shocking. She apparently felt that one simply cut in half whatever was on one's plate and then popped it into one's mouth, no matter what the size.</p>
<p>He said the other night at a favourite restaurant (the Black Olive) she was presented with a lamb pie, which she cut in two and placed firmly into her maw. At first she just sat there with a flan-like smile as the crust stretched her lips to the shape of a drawn bow.</p>
<p>Then the searing heat of the pie's contents and lack of nearby water began to take its toll. The startled customers watched in disbelief as a well-dressed woman suddenly began to perform a combination St. Vitus's dance and a circus act. There was some applause and then a bit of money was tossed after her third backflip, followed closely by alarm as she cleared several tables of their contents and a slow-moving patron.</p>
<p>The deputy minister and his wife now dine separately, to their mutual satisfaction. However, most of us were still stuck on loose shorts. All this gave me an idea that I spent most of the afternoon refining and presented to my wife over dinner: In short, euthanize the cats. I received another sharp blow to my ear.</p>

<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>1556 words</div><div>13 December 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>

<p>Dennis Cahill had his first heart attack at home on a Saturday in August 2008.</p>
<p>He had his second one the following afternoon and this time -- in the only bit of Irish luck he had on a truly lousy day -- his brother was there to get him in an ambulance and to a hospital.</p>
<p>Two days later, Cahill was wheeled out of the cardiac unit in Olathe, Kan., with two stents in his heart, $83,000 US in medical bills and no way to pay them.</p>
<p>Fifty-two years old and without any health insurance since his divorce in 2007, the self-employed construction contractor is living -- by any definition -- a precarious American existence.</p>
<p>Cahill stopped taking his medications -- Plavix, Crestor and five other drugs designed to keep his heart pumping -- three months ago because he no longer could afford the $1,000 a month it cost to fill the prescriptions.</p>
<p>A painful hernia that bulges from his abdomen has gone untreated since 2005.</p>
<p>And don't get Cahill started about his knees. "The world's worst knees," he says.</p>
<p>His right knee is swollen so badly it stretches the fabric of his faded denims, and he leans heavily on a cane as he walks. His left knee bears the scars of four surgeries performed to fix rugby injuries 26 years ago.</p>
<p>Cahill suspects both need to be replaced.</p>
<p>But there is no money and -- because of his "pre-existing conditions" -- Cahill hasn't found an insurance company in the country that will offer him coverage.</p>
<p>So with nowhere else to go, this is where Cahill has come.</p>
<p>He has come to a cavernous convention hall in downtown Kansas City, Mo., that volunteer doctors and nurses have transformed for two days into a massive free health-care clinic -- offering everything from routine physical checkups to electrocardiograms to dental care to HIV testing and H1N1 flu shots.</p>
<p>In the face of the U.S. Midwest's first winter blizzard, more than 2,000 other Missourians and Kansans joined Cahill because they simply have no other health-care options.</p>
<p>According to organizers, about 80 per cent of the patients have jobs but lack insurance because skyrocketing premiums, deductibles and co-pays make it financially untenable.</p>
<p>Many others were recently unemployed -- recession victims who have lost their company-</p>
<p>provided health care but don't qualify for Medicaid, the U.S. government program for disabled and impoverished Americans.</p>
<p>Some hadn't seen a doctor in 10 years.</p>
<p>They came with untreated cases of cancer, blood-sugar levels that were off the charts and life-threatening hypertension. More than anything, they came with all the anxiety that goes with being sick and uninsured.</p>
<p>"I'm under all kinds of stress right now. I've got guys calling the house trying to collect debts. God knows what's going to happen to me next," says Cahill, who had last seen a doctor when one was operating on his heart 17 months ago.</p>
<p>"I read how they expect 44,000 people to die this year in America because they don't have health insurance," he says, citing a September study published in the American Journal of Public Health. "I might be one of them."</p>
<p>As the U.S. Congress battles over how to provide insurance to the estimated 46.3 million U.S. residents who were without health coverage last year, large-scale free clinics like the one held here this week are increasingly becoming a last-resort provider.</p>
<p>A September clinic in Houston, Texas, drew 2,000 people. Another 1,000 people showed up at a clinic in New Orleans in November, and 1,000 more came for care in Little Rock, Ark.</p>
<p>The huge turnout for the mass free clinics reflects a much larger demand at hundreds of smaller clinics across the country.</p>
<p>In 2008, more than four million patients sought out care at a free clinic in the United States. In 2009, it's estimated that number will grow to eight million, largely due to a surge in people who lost their health care along with their jobs.</p>
<p>"What we are trying to do is highlight the face of the uninsured," says Nicole Lamoureux, director of the National Association of Free Clinics, which is organizing the clinics. "Uninsured does not equal unemployed. These are people who are making the hard decisions about keeping food on the table and paying their bills, or paying a very high insurance premium."</p>
<p>Cahill's brother, Glen, made that very choice. A married optometrist with two children, Glen cancelled his insurance once the premiums reached $1,000 a month and the deductible hit $5,000 a year.</p>
<p>He has tried to find cheaper insurance. But he was rejected by one company because his teenage son was on a prescription to treat acne, and his wife had a false positive Pap smear.</p>
<p>"Right now, my wife and I are living on the edge and hoping things are OK," said Glen, who hadn't been to a doctor in four years before attending the Kansas City clinic.</p>
<p>"It's kind of nerve-wracking."</p>
<p>Mary Ann Vowels, 63, lost her health-care coverage in 2005 when she lost her job as -- of all things -- a health-insurance claims inspector.</p>
<p>She suffers from arthritis and has digestive-system problems.</p>
<p>But she only rarely sees her doctor and leaves prescriptions unfilled to avoid piling up debt. She can't afford the $600 a month it would cost her for private insurance.</p>
<p>"I'm in a Catch-22. If I don't get the medical care, the conditions get worse and deteriorate. If do try to get it, I go into debt up to my eyeballs," says Vowels, who saw the free clinic as a chance to address some long-neglected health concern.</p>
<p>"I do what I can when I can. But I know I'm basically just masking and treating symptoms until such time that something gives."</p>
<p>Sitting next to Vowels in the clinic's waiting area, 48-year-old Michael Lopez expressed frustration with the pace of negotiations in Congress for universal health-care legislation. He's been out of work since his car broke down a couple of years ago, leaving him unable to travel to temporary jobs.</p>
<p>"I haven't been to a doctor to take a physical in seven years. When you ain't got insurance, you ain't got it," says Lopez, who received flu shots, dental care and a prostate exam at the clinic.</p>
<p>"It's a joke that I can't see a doctor in the United States of America. It's a joke. That's all I can say in polite language."</p>
<p>Dr. Bridget McCandless, one of about 100 physicians and nurse practitioners who volunteered their services in Kansas City, operates her own free clinic for diabetics in Independence, Mo.</p>
<p>"People are coming in sicker than they've ever been," says McCandless.</p>
<p>"In hard times, their chronic disease comes in 15th on the list of things -- after child care, and a working car and living somewhere, paying utilities and dealing with banks. It's disheartening."</p>
<p>Many of her patients are "the new poor" who have no idea how to navigate the few safety nets available.</p>
<p>"For some of them, admitting that they are poor is so painful and overwhelming that they are waiting too long to engage," she says.</p>
<p>"They have gotten to the point where the house is gone or their diabetes is completely out of control, where they have been out of medicines for three months and they realize they are not going to be able to scrounge the money to get this taken care of."</p>
<p>For Dennis Cahill, there's an urgency to the health-care debate that he fears lawmakers in Washington don't understand.</p>
<p>"Look around this place," he says, gesturing at hundreds of waiting patients. "These aren't people living in refrigerator boxes. These are everyday people, and they're all in trouble."</p>
<p>In four hours at the Kansas City clinic, Cahill's blood tests prompted enough concern that one doctor sent him to get an ECG. A general surgeon who examined his hernia told him he urgently needed an operation. An orthopedic surgeon arranged for a followup on his knees next week.</p>
<p>"I'm finding out I'm really a mess," he says. As Cahill contemplates what's next, he sees only glimmers of hope.</p>
<p>Under legislation that the White House hopes will pass before Christmas, health-insurance companies would be prohibited from denying coverage to people who are already sick.</p>
<p>But those changes might not take effect for several years, and Cahill isn't sure he has that long.</p>
<p>His hope is that Congress will embrace a new plan that would extend Medicare coverage -- the government-run insurance plan for senior citizens -- to Americans as young as 55.</p>
<p>"I got two and a half [years] to go before I turn 55," he says. "Whether I make it, I don't know."</p>

<p>Joseph, Samuel, Benjamin and Jackson Sorensen bounce in their strollers as balloons fill the room and family members snap pictures.</p>
<p>The quadruplets' first birthday is a bittersweet milestone for their mother, Lisa Hardy. While she's thankful that the four babies born seven weeks prematurely last Dec. 5 have grown to be healthy and happy toddlers, she's faced with the challenge of raising them on her own: Her husband, Tim Sorensen, has been in hospital for four months after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>It was in early September that Sorensen was taken to Victoria General Hospital after complaining that his hands felt numb, Hardy said yesterday at the quads' first birthday party, held at a hall on the Saanich fairgrounds. "He hasn't been home since."</p>
<p>That's left Hardy mostly on her own caring for the four active toddlers. Now, with Sorensen unable to continue his job at B.C. Ferries and her maternity pay ending, she's wondering how she will make ends meet.</p>
<p>"It's been really tough on us," Hardy said, looking over at Sorensen in his wheelchair, on a day pass from the hospital.</p>
<p>More than 75 guests attended the party, many bringing donations instead of toys to help the quads, believed to be the only set on the Island.</p>
<p>Hardy had a caretaker working in her Brentwood Bay home for several months through funding from Santas Anonymous but that has ended.</p>
<p>Esther McLean, who organized the party, was passing around "Lisa's Wish List," where people could sign up to do household chores like vacuuming and yard work, which have fallen by the wayside with Sorensen not around.</p>
<p>"She's handling it the best she possibly can," McLean said. "She's found a strength she never thought she had."</p>
<p>Despite the unthinkable challenges, yesterday was a joyous celebration for the family. Everyone laughed when four pieces of cake were placed in front of the chubby-cheeked foursome dressed in matching argyle sweaters and they were told to dig in.</p>
<p>"They smell like icing," said Lori Orr, Hardy's close friend and neighbour, who comes over almost every night to help put the boys to bed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the quads have suffered no health problems and at 25 pounds, have developed at a normal rate.</p>
<p>They're crawling all over the place, Hardy said, so she tries to keeps them in the living room surrounded by safety gates.</p>
<p>The boys have become local celebrities, Orr said, recounting a time when she and Hardy took them shopping at Mayfair Mall in the quad stroller. The boys were instantly surrounded by about 25 people asking to take their picture.</p>
<p>Four personalized stockings hang on the wall as Hardy talks about Christmas, which she said will be scaled back this year. She just hopes that the boys can see their father on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>She has taken them to visit their dad in hospital only twice, because she's worried about the H1N1 virus. And even when Sorensen is well enough to come home, Hardy will face more challenges in taking care of him and helping him get around a house that's not wheelchair accessible.</p>
<p>She said it's the support of family and friends -- and the presence of her smiling sons -- that helps her cope.</p>
<p>"I guess just waking up to [the quadruplets] every morning makes it worthwhile."</p>

prematurely but are all doing well.

<p>THE mass H1N1 immunization clinics that were set up across the city in late October are now shut.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority said smaller clinics, where appointments will be necessary, will begin operation next week. Locations will be posted on the WRHA's website and the Free Press will also identify the locations on our web site.</p>
<p>Individuals must call ahead to book an appointment -- 786-8004, Monday to Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.</p>
<p>However, WRHA spokeswoman Heidi Graham said there will be occasional clinics where appointments won't be needed and those locations will also be posted on the WRHA's website daily and callers, booking an appointment, will also be given those locations.</p>
<p>A small clinic will operate today at the Kildonan Place Shopping Centre, from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Some family physicians will also be stocking the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. You should check with them for details.</p>
<p>The WRHA said 417 individuals received the H1N1 vaccine Friday morning, bringing the total in the Winnipeg region since the campaign began Oct. 26 to 247,508.</p>

</p>
<p>WARNING: For some people, use of this column may cause laughter, which can trigger nosebleeds, headaches, dizziness, swine flu and rare cases of dengue fever.</p>
<p>The Advertising Age is changing as more and more companies sue each other, in a strange new phenomenon called "truth in advertising."</p>
<p>Telus just fought a court battle to stop Rogers from saying it's "Canada's most reliable" wireless network, while Rogers is suing Bell for claiming it's Canada's "largest" network.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Pantene and Dove are fighting a shampoo war over who can say they "repair hair" better. Meanwhile Progresso Soups is suing Campbell's for claiming its soup is made with TLC, while Progresso's is made with MSG.</p>
<p>What's going on? It's been decades, practically centuries, since we consumers accepted the fact advertising is filled with exaggerations, distortions, fabrications, fantasies and outright lies. Now, suddenly, advertisers are fighting each other over who's telling the exact truth. Do they actually think we believe their stuff?</p>
<p>It may come as a shock to Big Advertising, but I know that a diamond isn't forever and flowers don't say</p>
<p>"I love you." I know that Coke isn't the real thing, that a phone call does not reach out and touch someone, that a day without orange juice isn't like a day without sunshine, and that Rice Krispies don't go "snap, crackle and pop."</p>
<p>I'm so cynical about ads that when a company boasts it's the "largest" or the "most reliable" phone network in Canada, I assume they're covering up the fact they're not the fastest, the clearest or the cheapest in Canada.</p>
<p>If I believed ads were true, I'd think that airfares advertised in papers were real - and I'd book flights to New York every week for $49, without reading the fine print that quintuples the price. If ads were honest, I'd assume that cars were ecological products designed to save the planet, because they're always pictured on deserted alpine peaks or beside crystal-clear waterfalls.</p>
<p>In fact, what would happen if ads really did start telling the truth? You get an idea by watching TV ads for prescription lifestyle drugs like Viagra, which now advertise legally on American TV - but only if they include lengthy warnings about all possible side effects.</p>
<p>They're weird to watch, like one arthritis drug that shows old people playing golf and smiling - while a long message in small print says: "Use of this product can cause upper respiratory infections, sinusitis and nausea. There have been reports of serious and fatal infections, including TB. ... There have been rare cases of lymphoma - a type of cancer - and infrequent cases of anaphylaxis, a sudden, life-threatening allergic reaction."</p>
<p>Yikes! Who's watching the ad when you're riveted to the warnings? Is this the future of all advertising? Imagine what other ads will be like when the fine print becomes the main message and honesty triumphs everywhere, like:</p>
<p>Car ads: Beneath footage of another car perched atop a sacred mountain, we'll see a message crawl that says: "Cars kill 25,000 people a year in North America alone, more than any other cause of fatality.</p>
<p>"In wet or snowy weather, cars may swerve, skid or occasionally flip. Driving this car is the most dangerous thing you'll ever do."</p>
<p>Fast food ads will say: "IF TAKEN REPEATEDLY THIS FOOD WILL MAKE YOU FAT. It can cause love handles, donut spread, big butt, pot belly, gut bucket and general immensity.</p>
<p>"When eaten with dessert and cola, it can also cause acne in teenagers. WARNING: The burger in this picture may not resemble the actual product."</p>
<p>Beauty product ads will say: "This cream works by using a medically recommended combination of Bioneutrino, Beautifca, Derma-glo and other made-up ingredients."</p>
<p>"Environmentally-friendly ads" will say: "This 'made with recycled materials' product has only one recyclable ingredient - the green paper sticker that says 'made with recycled materials.' The only reason this product is labeled 'eco-friendly', 'certified organic' and 'energy-efficient' is because we say so."</p>
<p>In fact, environmental marketing groups say that 98 per cent of "green labels" provide no supporting hard evidence. You're being "green- washed."</p>
<p>So maybe it's best that our relationship with advertisers stay like it is: They lie to us and we don't believe them - that way it's a fair fight. If they ever convince us they're telling the truth, then we don't stand a chance.</p>

<p>Curse it or em-brace it, snow is creeping across the country like it does every year in Canada, and snow lovers are gearing up for a season of snow play, from tobogganing to skating, skiing, even snow angels. If you dabble in the white stuff yourself, consider donating a snow angel to a sick child.</p>
<p>The 2nd annual Curel Snow Angel campaign is currently underway. Curel will donate $1 for every photo of a snow angel uploaded to its website, snowangel.curel.ca,as well as $1 from the sale of every bottle of Curel moisturizer. The money goes to the Starlight Children's Foundation, which provides support to families with children suffering critical illness or injuries. A family's life changes dramatically when a child is diagnosed with a life-threatening disease. Relationships can be strained by the tension. Much of the family's energy and money goes into treating and managing the illness, which is emotionally, physically and financially exhausting for everyone involved.</p>
<p>"Starlight works to restore the entire family's spirits during and after diagnosis and throughout the course of treatment," said Laura Mountjoy, Starlight's executive director.</p>
<p>Starlight's wide range of programs include educational games that help children and teens understand their disease and teen-created webisodes that explore questions like "Can I kiss my boyfriend when I'm in chemo?" The foundation even partnered with Marvel to create a comic book called X-men: Life Lessons, about a teen mutant who gets badly burned. The comic is written to help kids cope with the psychological and social impact of severe burns, and provides tips on dealing with classmates and learning not to define yourself by your injury.</p>
<p>Starlight also has a wish program that has given more than 2,000 families the chance to spend some exciting time together outside of hospital walls.</p>
<p>The program is especially helpful during these days of government cutbacks and diversions like H1N1, which eat into the resources and support at hospitals. "The more isolation happening within hospitals, the more our services are in demand," said Ms. Mountjoy. "We've had calls from 30 hospitals asking for an activity kit, something they can give a kid to make their wait a little better." Starlight distributes more than 40,000 such kits a year to hospitals, which are put together by volunteers from the corporate sector.</p>
<p>"We receive an incredible amount of corporate support," said Ms. Mountjoy, "but sadly there are far too many children that need our help."</p>
<p>The Curel campaign was a perfect fit, she said.</p>
<p>"It's a great viral campaign about being together with your family and doing some good at the same time." And it's a great way to teach your kids about philanthropy. Some people even get their dogs involved.</p>
<p>Of course, while some Canadians are already shoveling, others are still stuck in the soggy storm stage. So don't worry if your part of the country hasn't enjoyed its first snowstorm yet -- the Curel campaign runs until the end of March. And for the lucky Canadians who escape the winter, tropical sand angels are also accepted.</p>

<p>Push on for more to get H1N1 shot</p>
<p>The push to increase the number of people vaccinatedis still strong as Ontario's top health official warned people on Friday not to become complacent about getting their H1N1 shot. "The impact of this illness on individuals and families has not been inconsequential," said Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health. Since the flu hit last April, 1,733 people have been hospitalized and 113 have died, with seven deaths this week. "These H1N1 fatalities aren't just numbers. They represent the loss of people's loved ones, spouses, mothers, fathers, and children. This pandemic is not over," said King, as she dismissed criticism the province was overreacting to the virus.</p>

<p>Toronto police say they will be getting help from a popular American television program in their search for missing teen Mariam Makhniashvili. Police say America's Most Wanted will mention the case on the program that airs Saturday at 9 p.m. The program has featured the girl's disappearance on its website. Miriam, now is 18, has been missing since Sept. 14. Toronto police have said thousands of interviews have failed to generate any leads about what happened to her.</p>

<p>Deal proceeds in priest sex abuse case</p>
<p>A historic class-action settlement involving Roman Catholic priests accused of abusing young boys in Nova Scotia will proceed after clearing a final hurdle, a lawyer for the victims said Friday. John McKiggan said the Diocese of Antigonish has agreed to go ahead with the $15-million deal after passing a Dec. 4 deadline that would allow people to opt out. Alleged victims had until that date to opt out, at which point the diocese and the man who filed the original suit could also have withdrawn from the arrangement. But McKiggan said the diocese has decided to proceed with the settlement even though some people have told counsel for the church that they want out.</p>

Liberal sources said late Friday that Rocco Rossi has resigned as the party's top administrator and fundraiser and will announce Monday his intention to seek the mayor's chair in Canada's largest city.

<div id="hd"><b>A garage-rock hero passes quietly; Greg Johnson, 41, died of a rare blood infection after 'a very loud life'</b>
</div><div>John Mackie   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>715 words</div><div>12 December 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>E2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Greg Johnson wasn't a household name like Michael Buble or Chad Kroeger. But in local garage rock circles, he was a fixture, the singer in psychedelic trash bands like the Fiends and the Worst.</p>
<p>Recently Johnson developed what he thought was the flu; it was a rare blood infection. After lapsing into a coma, Johnson died Dec. 4 at St. Paul's Hospital. He was 41. "He had a quiet passing," said Johnson's stepfather Rod McIntyre. "But he had a very loud life."</p>
<p>Indeed. Garage rock impresario Nardwuar the Human Serviette said that Johnson was the living embodiment of garage rock, a raucous musical style brimming with attitude, nasty guitar riffs and swirling organ.</p>
<p>"He perfectly executed it," said Nardwuar. "Locally I don't think anybody else came close, or will ever come close."</p>
<p>Nardwuar fondly recalls a wild show the Worst played at the Arcadian Hall with Britain's Thee Headcoats.</p>
<p>"They were just amazing," he said. "It was perfectly executed, in the Music Machine tradition of garage rock. Black Beatle boots, black jeans, black turtleneck, longhairovertheeyes, amedallionperhaps. Some shakers, going 'na na na na na na' ... it was just perfect, exactly how you'd imagine garage rock to be. 'Cause nowadays a lot of peoplearelike'garagerockislikethis, garage rock is like that.' No! That was it. The GruesomesandtheWorstweregaragerock."</p>
<p>Fiends guitarist Chad Winquist (stage name, Frodo Fiend) said that Johnson was a walking encyclopedia of garage rock, a cult phenomenon dating to the mid-1960s.</p>
<p>Sadly, playing garage rock wasn't the road to fame and fortune. Johnson worked as a shipper-receiver in warehouses by day, and plied his musical craft by night. His career highlight was getting his 45s, EPs and albums released on European labels like Screaming Apple and Music Maniac in Germany and Dr. Mushroom records in Greece. "That's where they appreciate garage rock," said Nardwuar.</p>
<p>The subject matter of his songs tended to be the stuff of horror films, as evidenced in the Worst's EP Tunes From The Tomb and the Fiends' Zombies Have Feelings Too and Zombie A-Go- Go. His birthday was Oct. 30, the day before Halloween, and he always made a point of doing a show. The last one was Oct. 30 at the Railway Club, where he was a regular.</p>
<p>Johnson's health problems started in early November. "He came down with a case of endocarditis, which is an infection of the heart valve," McIntyre said. "It showed up as flu symptoms."</p>
<p>McIntyre took Johnson to Vancouver General, where he was admitted right away because they thought he might have the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"He was in isolation and needed to be put on a respirator," said McIntyre. "They didn't have an extra respirator, so he was moved over to Lions Gate. He was in there until they figured out that his kidneys had shut down. They didn't have a dialysis machine, so he got moved to St. Paul's, to the ICU there."</p>
<p>He was in a coma for three of his last four weeks. "The infection had travelled through his bloodstream up to his brain, and it caused little aneurysms," said McIntyre. "He had bleeding in the brain. So he took a couple of steps back, [but] started coming forward again on Thursday night. Early Friday morning he had another event. The pressure increased in his brain and basically his central nervous system shut down and there was nothing left to do. As soon as he was taken off the respirator that was it."</p>
<p>Johnson died the day before his friends staged a benefit show at the WISE Hall to help pay his bills. It became a wake, and was sold out, raising $3,000. The money will go to his daughter. A funeral service and reception will be held today from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. at the Boys and Girls Club, 395 East Sixth in Vancouver.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>From landslide to crisis mode in 22 months</b>
</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>797 words</div><div>12 December 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach led his Progressive Conservative government to a landslide victory in March 2008 with a promise to change the way government operated. Responding to a pre-election poll that suggested nearly 46 per cent of Albertans wanted a change, Stelmach ran on the slogan "Change that works for Albertans." He depicted himself as a new leader capable of bringing fresh ideas and new energy to government. He promised more accountability in government and he vowed to listen to grassroots Tories.</p>
<p>Albertans embraced his message. The Conservatives swept 72 of the province's 83 seats -- the largest Tory majority since Ralph Klein won 74 seats in March, 2001.</p>
<p>Now, just 22 months later, the Conservatives are in full crisis mode. A new survey by Angus Reid suggests that if an election was held today the Tories would lose and the fledgling Wildrose Alliance would form the next government.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the Tories, the next election is still two to three years away. But what has gone so horribly wrong to change the fortunes of the party that has governed Alberta since 1971?</p>
<p>The unravelling began shortly after the votes were counted when, behind closed doors, Stelmach and his cabinet ministers gave themselves a whopping 30-to 35-per-cent raise. The salary hike, which evoked outrage across the province, made Stelmach the highest paid premier in Canada.</p>
<p>Since then the party's waffling on its new oil and gas royalty regime, its elimination of regional health authorities without any consultation and its controversial move to arbitrarily eliminate public hearings for controversial new power lines have angered Albertans of every political stripe.</p>
<p>Add to that the province's plunge into deficit finances, the H1N1 vaccination fiasco and the revelation that Conservatives MLAs are now being paid an additional $12,000 annually to meet among themselves in secret committees and you have a government in full free fall on the public opinion charts.</p>
<p>Critics contend that rather than throwing open the doors of government like he promised, Stelmach has slammed them closed and shuttered the windows. Meetings that were open under the previous regime are now closed to media and the public. The New Democrats have repeatedly accused the Tories of governing by stealth, calling them the most secretive government in Canada.</p>
<p>Albertans have been kept in the dark over health care reforms -- not learning of major changes until they have been implemented. They have had to glean details of the Alberta Health Services financial status from speeches made by Alberta bureaucrats in other provinces. They have little faith in acerbic and bellicose Health Minister Ron Liepert who apparently only dispenses information on a need to know basis.</p>
<p>How far the Conservatives plummet will depend largely on what the premier does in the next few months. Party members sent the premier a strong message at the recent leadership review that they want to see a major overhaul of this government -- the one that they were promised. They want to see wholesale changes in his inner circle and in his cabinet. They want new blood and new ideas. They want vision.</p>
<p>The premier could likely boost his ratings immediately by firing Liepert and replacing him with someone more thoughtful and less belligerent. It might also be time to send Energy Mel Knight down the road before he comes up with another multibillion-dollar handout to the oilpatch.</p>
<p>Cabinet needs more than a shuffle -- it needs a major shake. Now is the time to replace some of those long-in-the-tooth ministers with some of the younger, brighter lights on the backbenches. It's also time the premier got himself some better advice. Many inside and outside government say the premier must replace his chief of staff with someone more experienced.</p>
<p>It is never good for a politician to be the smartest guy in the room.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the premier has time on his side. The Wildrose Alliance is still on a honeymoon with new leader Danielle Smith, but it is a party with no platform, few credible candidates and a lot of baggage. Albertans are poking Stelmach in the eye with a sharp stick today, knowing they won't be called to make a decision for several more years. But it should be abundantly clear that what he does from now on is critical to his political survival and the continuation of his party's 38-year reign.</p>
<p>Alberta has a curious political history. The previous governing dynasties -- <span class="companylink">United Farmers of Alberta</span> and Social Credit -- were crushed by a fledgling parties that emerged from the political right.</p>
<p>A victory by the Wildrose in 2012 would make it three for three.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper, as chairman of the G8 and G20 summits of major industrialized countries next June, needs to pick up the ball fumbled by Italy when it hosted last summer's G8 summit of world leaders, says the head of the world's top organization leading the fight against the AIDS epidemic.</p>
<p>Michel Kazatchkine, executive director of the $18-billion US Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, said he was deeply disappointed the G8 gathering hosted by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi ignored the AIDS crisis.</p>
<p>"My concern is: Will Canada actually be a leader when it convenes the G8 and the G20 in actually expanding the effort (of donor countries in) going significantly higher in their contribution for the next years?" Kazatchkine said yesterday in an interview with Canwest News Service.</p>
<p>Kazatchkine will be visiting world capitals early next year, in an effort to convince donor countries to renew their three-year pledges that were made a year before the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>He said he has "no doubt" Canada will continue to support the fund, and he said he hopes Harper can convince G20 members to expand the body's focus beyond financial matters.</p>
<p>The HIV-AIDS epidemic continues in many countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, and the number of HIV-positive men, women and children has soared to 33 million.</p>
<p>But the issue has moved far from the global political and media spotlight that has been fixed on the financial crisis, war, climate change and the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>The Harper government's 2008 budget pledged $450 million over three years to the Global Fund, increasing Canada's commitment to the Geneva-based organization to just under $1 billion since its inception. Canada is the eighth-largest donor nation.</p>
<p>The Global Fund says it has saved 4.9 million lives in 140 countries through programs that have funded mosquito nets, education and outreach programs, testing and distribution of medicines and expanded antiretroviral treatments for millions of HIV-positive people.</p>
<p>He said his fund has had to effectively borrow $3 billion to $4 billion US from the anticipated 2011-13 funding to pay for 2010 commitments. "I'm very concerned," he said of donors' likely willingness to increase commitments.</p>

</p>
<p>The World Health Organization on Friday stood by its advice on the use of Tamiflu in high risk swine flu patients, insisting that it was effective in those cases despite a study questioning the antiviral drug. WHO spokesman Gregory Haertl said the UN agency was not challenging the international scientific study's findings on Tamiflu treatment for seasonal flu in otherwise healthy patients. However, he insisted that there was "substantial" evidence since the pandemic A(H1N1) strain emerged in April showing that the basic drug, oseltamivir, was an effective treatment for swine flu in high risk groups. The updated review published in the British Medical Journal this week found the drug had only "modest effectiveness against the symptoms of influenza in otherwise healthy adults."</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>The push to increase the number of people vaccinated in the province is still strong as Ontario's top health official warned people yesterday not to become complacent about getting their H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>Since the flu hit last April, she said, 1,733 people have been hospitalized and 113 have died, with seven of those deaths happening this week.</p>
<p>"This pandemic is not over," warned Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health.</p>

Great local colour!</p>
<p>Wild Animals, by Edward Bustos with illustrations by Lucho Rodríguez (Tundra, 24 pages, $15 hardcover).</p>
<p>The animals depicted in this picture book are absolutely gorgeous; they are more works of art than simply illustrations.</p>
<p>The stylized faces in brilliant colours on a black background have short accompanying descriptions of the particular animal.</p>
<p>Whether to see a lion or a leopard, a hippopotamus or a hyena, a koala or a yak, young readers will love to turn the pages of this fascinating animal story book.</p>
<p>Both author and artist are from South America. Mexican-born Bustos now lives in Chile, while Columbian-born Rodriguez hales from Bolivia.</p>
<p>ABC Our Country (Tundra Books, 32 pages each, $10 paperback.</p>
<p>These new editions of previously published alphabet books are beautifully illustrated with full-page dramatic artwork.</p>

<p>They are marvellous way to introduce young readers to Canada.</p>
<p>For beginning readers (ages 5-8)</p>
<p>Zoom, by Tim Wynne-Jones with illustrations by Eric Beddows (Groundwood, 102 pages, $25 hardcover).</p>
<p>This is a collection of the Ontario author's three very popular stories about the adventurous cat, Zoom, who runs away to sea seeking his seafaring uncle, Captain Roy.</p>
<p>Included are Zoom at Sea, Zoom Away and Zoom Upstream. With the original black-and-white illustrations by Ontario artist Beddows, and presented in a handsome red cover with gold print, this would be a welcome Christmas gift for any novice reader or a great read-aloud book.</p>
<p>The Mummer's Song, by Bud Davidge with illustrations by Ian Wallace (Groundwood, 32 pages, $13 paperback).</p>
<p>Another classic reprint, this Newfoundland tale of mummers who visit on Christmas dressed in outlandish costumes to play music, dance and sing was first published in 1993. But it hasn't lost its charm.</p>
<p>This new version includes a CD so young enthusiasts can sing along. Former Torontonian (now Massachusetts) artist Ian Wallace's coloured pencil artwork is detailed and delightful.</p>
<p>Wanda's Freckles, by Barbara Azore with artwork by Georgia Graham (Tundra, 24 pages, $22 hardcover).</p>
<p>This fun story by an Edmonton author is for any child who's worried about being a little different.</p>

<p>Violet, by Tanya Duprey Stehlik with artwork by Vanja Vuleta Jovanovic (Second Story Press, 24 pages, $15 hardcover).</p>
<p>This book by the Toronto author has a special message for any child of mixed racial background. Violet wonders why she isn't the same colour as her dad (blue) or her mum (red), but finally realizes that her own colour, a mixture of the two, is a beautiful shade in between. Toronto artist Jovanovic's illustrations resemble an animated cartoon.</p>
<p>For juvenile readers (ages 8-11)</p>
<p>The Curse of the Evening Eye, by Carol Matas and Perry Nodelman (Key Porter, 248 pages, $12 paperback).</p>
<p>This is the Winnipeg authors' second novel in the Ghostbusters series starring Molly and Adam Barnett.</p>
<p>Like the first book, The Proof That Ghosts Exist, this one features plenty of spirits, both friendly and wicked, and lots of cliffhanging situations as Molly and Adam try to outwit the ghost of a wronged parlour maid before she can murder their father.</p>
<p>Set mainly in Palm Springs, this is fast read for Matas and Nodelman fans.</p>
<p>Fever Season, by Eric Zweig (Dundurn Press, 246 pages, $13 paperback)</p>
<p>This novel is particularly relevant in this year of the H1N1 scare. In Montreal during the First World War, David Saifert is left an orphan when his father dies and his mother and sister succumb to the flu.</p>
<p>He gets a job helping with the Montreal Canadiens, and when they play a Seattle team for the Stanley Cup he knows it's his one chance to find his long lost uncle.</p>
<p>Ontario-based Zweig is most comfortable giving commentary on hockey games, but the story comes alive when he describes hockey legends Joe Hall and Newsy Lalonde. Good for hockey fans.</p>
<p>Lights! Curtains! Cows! by Karin Adams (Lorimer, 132 pages, $9 paperback).</p>
<p>The Grade 7 students in fictional Ellis, Man., have been looking forward to performing in the Legend of Cow Valley ever since they were in kindergarten.</p>
<p>Now they learn that the farm where the play takes place is to be sold and the play cancelled. How can Greg, Mike and Becky save the day and the town?</p>
<p>This is a humorous offering by a former teacher at the University of Winnipeg. Rural readers who'll chuckle at the cow stampede on stage at the story's climax will especially appreciate it.</p>
<p>For young adults (ages 12-18)</p>
<p>Crusade, by John Wilson (Key Porter, 348 pages, $18 hardcover).</p>
<p>This is Part 1 of a proposed series called The Heretic's Secret by a prolific and popular writer from Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>Set in the 13th century, it is the story of the Cathars, a sect who believed in a liberal interpretation of the Bible and who were persecuted by a fanatical branch of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Two young men, John and Peter, are caught up in opposite sides of the conflict as towns are razed by the Catholic crusaders and Cathars try to escape with their secret knowledge of ancient texts. Based on historical evidence, this is a gripping and disturbing tale.</p>
<p>The Prince of Neither Here Nor There, by Sean Cullen (Puffin, 224 pages, $13 paperback).</p>
<p>The popular Canadian actor-comedian injects this fantasy novel with plenty of humour as Brendan, the high-school misfit, discovers he really belongs in the world of faeries (more robust than fairies).</p>
<p>Lots of adventure and suspense as Brendan tries to recover his lost amulet to save his life and take his rightful place as the prince. For fantasy lovers in early teens.</p>
<p>The Goldsmith's Daughter, by Tanya Landman (Candlewick Press, 304 pages, $20 hardcover).</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The cost of a Christmas bargain? Just the economy as we know it</b>
</div><div>BERT ARCHER   </div>
<div>1158 words</div><div>12 December 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>F5</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Calgary writer Gordon Laird's just-published book The Price of a Bargain is the result of a decade's research into the interconnectedness of all things in our global economy, from the supply of fossil fuels to the ornaments on a family's Christmas tree.</p>
<p>The past couple of decades have seen prices for consumer goods tumble, the result of what Mr. Laird calls “bargaineers” – companies, such as <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>, that engineer unprecedentedly cheap prices through low-cost manufacture, shipping and distribution, sending carbon emissions through the roof and wages through the floor.</p>
<p>Like many of its products, he argues, it's a system that was not built to last.</p>
<p>The Bay had a 60 per cent off sale for Christmas trees last week. What's going on when a company sells its product for less than half price in not only its peak sales season, but its only sales season?</p>
<p>Instead of the usually good tidings of the holiday season, we're seeing an economy trying to save itself desperately. If these companies can't make their margins in December and January, they won't stay solvent. The only choice is to bargain harder.</p>
<p>Are you suggesting these low, low prices can't continue?</p>
<p>There is an end-game aspect to having all this for so little. I think the massive retail phenomenon – it accounts for about 70 per cent of our economic activity in Canada – is sort of an endangered activity. Only the bargaineers, the radical bargain makers like <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> and dollar stores, are thriving.</p>
<p>Dollar stores?</p>
<p>Dollars stores sell as much collectively as a top-50 Fortune 500 company already. Dollar stores, <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> and major discounters, which would include chains such as Winners, for example, are the only ones who are showing any significant growth right now. We're evolving towards an economy of bottom feeders.</p>
<p>At least it keeps things cheap.</p>
<p>Discounts exist because there's a surplus of goods that need to be sold off quick because we need to move on to the next season, the next market. The only reason the cheapest of the cheap exists is because there's the Bay buying up the stuff that is later getting sold as discount. The ecology of our economy is turning into a monoculture. Monocultures don't generally do well in the long term. Look at the human body – look at H1N1, for example. You have a viral infection where one organism dominates and the host dies.</p>
<p>So your book is about how we should all pay more for everything and be happy about it?</p>
<p>Well, that would be the Maoist version of it.</p>
<p>No, the book is partly about how we've become captives of the economy that we live in – captives in the sense that our economy is based on our continuing to spend as much as we have at prices that we've become accustomed to. There's a few problems with that, not the least of which is that energy is not going to be as good as it has been – $150-a-barrel oil is not that far off.</p>
<p>And speaking of Mao …</p>
<p>Yes. The fact that major nations such as the United States are in debt to China in ways we've never seen before underlies the fact of how the transfer of power is really happen-</p>
<p>ing, and that transfer of power has been about dollar-store trinkets.</p>
<p>China has invested itself in making those and selling them to us. Who's going to run the world in the future? Who's going to control the North Pole and Santa's goodies?</p>
<p>So geopolitics is being defined by 99-cent snow globes and the people who buy them.</p>
<p>Except for those of us who live off the land and make our own shoes, it's pretty hard to exclude ourselves from this. This is a picture that's interdependent in a way that's unprecedented in human history. Even on Buy Nothing Day, those people who buy groceries still are part of this globalization. The problem with interdependence is that there's not really an opt-out clause.</p>
<p>An old buddy of yours, Naomi Klein, suggested in the recently reissued No Logo that we should probably not buy <span class="companylink">Nike</span> shoes any more. Do you have any similar recommendations?</p>
<p>I think that morally the whole impetus of the original anti-globalization movement was correct. But globalization is so complex that people selling the goods here in the West, even in good faith, often have had no idea they were selling blood products, toxic products, products that were created in prisons.</p>
<p>Boycotting <span class="companylink">Nike</span>, what did it do? It made the web of contracting and subcontracting even more complicated.</p>
<p>So how do we deal with it?</p>
<p>Well, that's a good question. Much of the modern consumer economy is embodied energy. So one of the short answers would be a shift to the true pricing of embodied energy and carbon, which – because everything would get more expensive – would mean a move away from an economy dominated by consumerism.</p>
<p>Which sounds like a good thing, but I sense a “but”?</p>
<p>The Achilles heel of our system is that it needs open, liberalized trade relationships, cheap energy and able, hungry consumers. And all of these things are being challenged as we speak. I don't think the consumers this year will show up for consumer duty in the mass numbers that we've seen in recent years.</p>
<p>We're used to having goodies showered upon us, Santa-like, in the shape of deals that have not been seen before, that are really quite innovative and have given consumers access to new technologies and a sense of wealth, that previous generations didn't enjoy. And more people around the world are looking for this dream of having more for less. It wasn't a bad dream entirely. It just wasn't built to last.</p>
<p>There's an environmental, climatic aspect to it, but there's a profound human, social aspect of it too: We're already leaving people behind. In the States, there's 10-per-cent unemployment, created in part by the sort of frenzied overspending we're talking about, and the easy credit that fuels it. That's pretty huge. At a certain level, people just can't afford to participate in the so-called normal economy, even when it's cheap.</p>
<p>So the normal economy has to change – and it will change, fundamentally. Us running out of consumers with our current economic model is like Saudi Arabia running out of oil. We don't have a Plan B.</p>
<p>Not to go all negative on the holidays, but imagine Saudi Arabia without oil. It's not a fun place.</p>

</p>
<p>RANDOM THOUGHTS WHILE LINING UP FOR A FLU SHOT AT HILLSIDE MALL YESTERDAY:</p>
<p>- Some guys at work did the math: If Victoria charged a 25-cent toll to every car crossing a new Johnson Street bridge, the city could pay it off in 15 years.</p>
<p>- Your electricity bill says that in the event of a power outage you can look up power-outage information on the <span class="companylink">B.C. Hydro</span> website. As Pender Island readers point out, this is a big help if your Internet provider is juiceless.</p>
<p>- A million-dollar drug bust in Vancouver uncovered ecstasy pills branded with the Olympic logo. Are these guys nuts? Gangsters might not fear the Canadian justice system, but running afoul of the IOC Brand Police is inviting big-time trouble.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got to the front of the flu-shot line and found I had been waiting to buy snow shovels instead. Apparently our priorities have shifted. A pandemic Victoria can handle, but the threat of snow? Forget the Tamiflu. Break out the Valium.</p>
<p>As for the H1N1 vaccine, you could probably find it in the bargain bin, piled high 10-for-a-dollar alongside the Atkins diet cookbooks, Arsenio Hall tapes and Y2K survival kits. OK, it's not really like that. There was, in fact, a steady stream of Victorians exercising their right to bare arms at the Hillside flu clinic yesterday.</p>
<p>But demand for the H1N1 shots has dropped rapidly enough that the Vancouver Island Health Authority will end its mass-immunization clinics after Dec. 18. After that, people can still get the shots from their doctors, a public-health unit or certain pharmacies.</p>
<p>Oh, but we're a fickle lot. A month ago, the lineups resembled the evacuation of Dunkirk, people both jittery and orderly as a combination of fear, low vaccine supply and high infection rate sent Islanders chasing the flu shot like the last <span class="companylink">Sony</span> PlayStation on Christmas Eve. The province's medical health officer, Dr. Perry Kendall, held a daily briefing at the legislature, the media hanging on every word as he explained the relative merits of adjuvanted versus unadjuvanted vaccine and answered the pressing question of whether the Abbotsford Heat had budged in line.</p>
<p>Now? Supply is plentiful. H1N1 wasn't as harmful as we feared; as of Tuesday, it had killed 47 British Columbians -- sad, but nowhere close to the 400 to 800 who die of seasonal flu in a typical year. The flu has peaked. The anxiety has peaked. Demand has peaked.</p>
<p>Is it still worth getting the shot? Yes, says Kendall. "The virus is going to be around for a while." The vaccine has been proven safe, it's available, so why not? "It's like a free insurance policy."</p>
<p>Well, not exactly free. B.C. ordered 4.1 million doses at a cost of $32 million. About 40 per cent of us have received the shot. Even if that rises to 60 per cent, perhaps 1.6 million doses will remain. The vaccine has a shelf life of 18 months. We could stockpile it for next year, when it might have some use, try selling it to those in the Southern Hemisphere that can afford it, or (and let's remember that it's Christmas) simply donate it to the many more who can't.</p>
<p>The end of the clinics means VIHA, which devoted 6,000 worker-days to the vaccination blitz, can take some public-health programs off the back burner. Kindergarten students will be screened in January for dental, hearing and vision problems, something usually done in the fall, says VIHA's Sandra Herbison. The school immunization program that was interrupted in September will resume then, too. So will drop-in programs for parents of babies and toddlers.</p>
<p>Have to figure the public-health nurses -- and the retirees and other hospital nurses who augmented their ranks -- would be sick of giving shots by now, would be as tired as Tiger Woods on Valentine's Day. But no, it's been fun seeing everyone work together, said nurse Kathy McKenna, who gave me my needle, perhaps her 60th of the day. (It was less painful than watching So You Think You Can Dance.)</p>
<p>Besides, said fellow nurse Betty Poag, Canada's largest-ever vaccination campaign taught some valuable lessons for the next time -- and there will be a next time.</p>
<p>"When something more serious arrives, we will have this to learn from."</p>

<p>I have been so impressed with some of the recent letters and articles that I want to say "Thank You".</p>
<p>Bruce Johnstone; on the "Dome" question, and the one recognizing the contribution -- largely unsung -- of Jim Hopson to the success of the Riders, are both highly commendable.</p>
<p>Murray Mandryk's Dec. 5 article on government finance was excellent. If they are ever looking for a new deputy minister of finance, obviously Mandryk is the man they should draft!</p>
<p>Two letters deserve commendation. Cindy Anderson said what I, and probably many others, should have said, when she praised the folks at Robert Usher for their professionalism in handling the H1N1 shots. Like everyone else, I guess I took it all for granted. She went the extra mile and thanked them. Another writer, Wally Hauk, responded to the letter "Tax group speaks on our behalf", which appeared in the Dec. 2 Leader-post. He makes the point that the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, which was the entity "speaking on our behalf" does not speak for him. I don't know who they speak for, and I haven't heard of anyone that has been able to get an answer to that question either, not for want of trying!</p>
<p>Larry Hill's excellent article on the <span class="companylink">Canadian Wheat Board</span> (Nov. 19) provoked a reply by Art Mainil. I would just say that quoting selected figures out of context may look fancy, but it is not by any means a satisfactory rebuttal to Hill's well-written piece.</p>
<p>Finally, I objected to seeing those stories of the two "horrific crimes" given front-page prominence (Dec. 5). Wouldn't it have been more responsible to have run them somewhere in the body of the paper, for one thing at least, to play down the "monkey see, monkey do" effect? I guess it is a rhetorical question.</p>

<p>If you fit the profile of today's modern newspaper reader, as indicated by our surveys, our consultants and ol' Mort, who has been dropping by every Tuesday since 1931 with the week's batch of Blondie, two news topics currently dominate your interests.</p>
<p>Which of the pair qualifies for the top story of 2009 is another question entirely, and a year-end topic of much debate around the office.</p>
<p>Is it H1N1, swine flu, the pandemic that took hold late in the spring, afflicting millions around the world with headaches, fever, nausea and fatigue?</p>
<p>Or is it global warming, the major topic on which, if presented one more opinion piece, you will suffer all the above symptoms of H1N1 news coverage overkill, plus you will upchuck so violently as to taste your own toenails?</p>
<p>Let's have a show of hands.</p>
<p>Global warming?</p>
<p>Anybody?</p>
<p>OK. Apparently, even with the year's twin powerhouse interest topics of H1N1 and global warming, I have already lost every single one of you newspaper readers. Any outrageous or libelous mistruth that springs to mind I could publish right here, right now, and, without an audience, I'd be immune from prosecution or litigation. But my neighbour Gary Snerbleflute's late-night penchant for dressing up like Anne of Green Gables, allegedly, when he is not pestering innocent people about the return of electric hedgeclippers that never were borrowed last June, the little pig-tailed, straw-hatted freak, is in no way germane to today's column.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have ways of measuring reader interest without need for readers. A quick computerized check of the archives reveals that, since Jan. 1, editors have met the insatiable public demand for pandemic updates by running 448 stories that mentioned the search phrase "H1N1" and 236 more with "swine flu," compared to 280 with a match for "climate change" and 113 that included "global warming."</p>
<p>So, then, 448 plus 238, carry the one for six -- ah, what the hey, let's just declare global warming the top story of 2009 in a landslide.</p>
<p>I could make H1N1 the winner and go on to write about it, except I personally know people who are right now bed-ridden with the flu and who are truly miserable. Every one of them is well-versed on the issue, with bits of knowledge that might well contradict my journalistic facts, and the last thing I need is their dragging themselves out of bed, in a foul mood, to take me to task. Conversely, climate change is strictly theoretical, neither proven nor refuted, a rich, fertile issue for any respected public commentator's half-baked viewpoints. Also, given that Saskatchewan is currently in an extended period of provincial frigiding, global warming offers hope.</p>
<p>Until now, climate change was a topic I felt best left to my superior colleagues, the big thinky types who are far more adept at tackling strictly theoretical subjects. Me, I study that raw scientific data, the temperatures readings that go back to the Ice Age before the advent of thermometers, that were recorded from the past two centuries of weather stations, that extend far, far into years that have not yet, technically, happened, all the way to when, two generations from now, the earth is on average 1.768 degrees warmer, and I chin-stroke the following conclusion: hmmm. I have nothing to contribute. My forte is personal observation, such as checking the weekend weather forecast (-26) against my car's outside temperature reading on Saturday (-23) and on Monday composing the journalistic exposé "Environment Canada: Nincompoops? Or what?"</p>
<p>And where has all that taken me?</p>
<p>Not to Denmark, that is for sure. As I sit here at work, still waiting on mileage reimbursement for a trip to Hodgeville in October, all the big thinky columnists are gathered in one of Europe's truly great cities, checking out Copenhagen's famous Marble Castle, sampling Denmark's famous pastries, chawing Copenhagen's famous snoose, and covering the United Nations Climate Change Conference.</p>
<p>The general upshot of the conference, as I now read it, is as follows: either a batch of private e-mails, notes from scientists to scientists that weren't supposed to be read in public, have been blown way out of proportion, like a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> posting some 13-year-old girl later regrets -- that, or the predicted end of civilization is malarkey.</p>
<p>This is considered a critical turning point.</p>
<p>Microbes come and microbes go. Viruses are vagabonds. H1N1 has no shelf life on the newsstands.</p>
<p>Whereas global warming will be back next year, and even the year after that (2011, by general scientific consensus, albeit disputed), like any good hypothesis.</p>
<p>Not the greatest tidings of good cheer I bring you, but there you go.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>MS patient loses battle with bureaucracy; Fearful of H1N1, teacher sought paid preventive leave</b>

<div>657 words</div><div>11 December 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>At the height of the H1N1 scare, Montreal schoolteacher Anna Maria Mea stopped work on her doctor's advice to lower her risk of infection from exposure to swine flu.</p>
<p>Mea has multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune condition that lowers her resistance to disease; her doctor feared the flu shot might not protect her.</p>
<p>But after six weeks without pay, Mea learned that her request for paid preventive leave had been rejected, highlighting a gap in the system when it comes to protecting people with severe health problems.</p>
<p>Provincial Health Department and labour officials initially said the preventive leave program, available under the provincial labour law covering pregnant women, does not apply outside pregnancy situations.</p>
<p>It's a workplace issue between workers and employers and it has nothing to do with public health, said Dr. Terry-Nan Tannenbaum, of the Montreal Health and Social Services Agency's department of public health.</p>
<p>The department of public health vets medical requests for pregnancy leaves because that's part of a public health program, Tannenbaum said, then the province's workplace health and safety board administers the program.</p>
<p>Alexandra Rény, of the Commission de la santé et de la sécurité du travail (CSST), would not comment on specific cases, but said leaves apply only to pregnant women and the safety board intervenes only when there is a workplace incident.</p>
<p>In a later interview, however, Rény expressed surprise to discover "a very rare clause" in the law on preventive leave, a policy that covers anyone with a work-related health issue. But it is so obscure, it has never been used. "I can't find one case," she said.</p>
<p>When it comes to pregnancy leaves, the CSST relies on physicians' expertise that work conditions would pose a risk to the woman or the unborn child, Rény said.</p>
<p>"It's the doctor who is the medical expert."</p>
<p>CSST decisions are usually rendered within 48 hours. Mea's claim took several weeks to process because it's an exceptionally rare request, Rény added.</p>
<p>Rény could not explain why the CSST would reject Mea's medically backed claim.</p>
<p>Mea's union is outraged.</p>
<p>"It sounds to us like they don't want to set a precedent," said Yves Parenteau, a spokesman for the Alliance des professeures et professeurs de Montréal, the teachers union.</p>
<p>The Health Department and the CSST have rejected other requests from immuno-suppressed workers, union representatives said. The union is seeking a legal opinion in Mea's case.</p>
<p>As for Mea, the six weeks without pay have left her scrambling financially. She is returning to work today even though she is scared for her health, as she teaches English as second language in kindergarten to Grade 6.</p>
<p>"I have no choice," said Mea, who has to cover a percentage of her monthly $3,500 drug costs on top of her rent and food charges. "I'm not at the food bank yet, but -"</p>
<p>Mea said she doesn't understand why the CSST took so long to tell her she doesn't qualify for a paid leave.</p>
<p>In retrospect, Mea who has no previous work-related CSST claims, said she could have taken sick leave, which she calls a last resort.</p>
<p>"Sometimes I have to walk with a cane or I'm feeling so much pain that it's hard, but I feel well enough to work," she said.</p>
<p>"The class is like my second home. Being pulled out of work wasn't my choice - it was the doctor's."</p>
<p>Mea's doctor didn't respond to requests for an interview.</p>

<p>Quebec health authorities will shut all temporary H1N1 vaccination clinics across the province on Dec. 18, Health Minister Yves Bolduc announced yesterday.</p>
<p>Next week, authorities will reveal the arrangements by which those who haven't been vaccinated will be able to get the flu shot at such places as community clinics, the minister added.</p>
<p>About 3.8 million Quebecers have been inoculated during the campaign - but the pace has slowed to about 90,000 shots daily from 150,000 a day at the peak.</p>
<p>Since the second wave of the pandemic began in late August, 74 Quebecers have died from this strain of influenza, provincial government figures indicate.</p>

</div><div>Maria Babbage   </div>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Politicians at the Ontario legislature wrapped up a tumultuous fall session Thursday that was marked by spending scandals, cabinet resignations, deepening economic troubles and an anti-tax protest that turned the chamber into a three-ring circus for nearly two days.</p>
<p>Despite the disruption, the governing Liberals accomplished their key goal - passing a bill that will merge the eight per cent provincial sales tax with the five per cent federal GST next July - over the noisy objections of the opposition parties.</p>
<p>Both the Conservatives and NDP pulled out all the stops over the last few weeks to oppose the harmonized sales tax, which they say will hit already struggling consumers with a massive tax hike.</p>
<p>The anti-HST crusade reached its zenith last week when a pair of maverick Tories, Bill Murdoch and Randy Hillier, staged a 44-hour sit-in to protest the lack of provincewide public hearings on the tax change. But it did little to delay the bill, which passed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Dwight Duncan remained unapologetic about the HST, emboldened by a September byelection victory for the Liberals that was widely touted as a referendum on the controversial tax harmonization plan. "No doubt the economy has been top of mind for everyone," he said.</p>
<p>"I'm optimistic about the coming year. I think we're through the worst. I think we're still not out of the woods completely, but I think we've laid out the right plan."</p>
<p>But there will also be some "tough choices" in 2010 as the government charts a new and painful course to staunch the red ink ahead of the next spring budget.</p>
<p>Duncan's fall economic update forecast a $24.7-billion deficit this year - the largest in Ontario's history - and scrapped the government's plan to re-balance the books by 2015 as plummeting revenues and increased spending emptied its coffers.</p>
<p>The government's troubles were compounded by a second wave of the H1N1 flu and a massive immunization program that saw hours-long lineups at clinics, a vaccine shortage and accusations of queue-jumping by athletes and hospital board members.</p>

</p>
<p>Two of the city's six H1N1 mass vaccination clinics will close permanently this afternoon.</p>
<p>The clinics at the South Calgary Health Centre and Richmond Road Diagnostic&Treatment Centre will close at 3:30 p.m. today and won't reopen to the public.</p>
<p>However, there will still be four other clinics offering both the H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccine to Calgarians.</p>
<p>They are located at the Stampede Grandstand, Avenida Village (303, 12445 Lake Fraser Dr. S.E.), Brentwood Village Mall (302, 3630 Brentwood Rd. N.W.), and Whitehorn(3705 35th St. N.E.).</p>
<p>All six clinics run from 8:30 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. today and the four clinics that will remain open after Friday also run from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Saturday.</p>
<p>There will be no clinics open on Sunday, but they will be open again Monday through Thursday from noon until 7 p.m.</p>
<p>All Albertans over six months of age are eligible to receive the H1N1 vaccine, and anyone in a high-risk category is also eligible to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine.</p>
<p>Officials are encouraging all Albertans get vaccinated in the coming weeks, since they expect a third wave of H1N1 in the new year.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Wildrose No. 1 in Alberta, poll finds; Tory support falls to lowest in 17 years</b>
</div><div>Jason Fekete   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>1009 words</div><div>11 December 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>T he surging Wildrose Alliance would form the next provincial government if an election were held in Alberta, according to a new poll that pegs the party with a double-digit lead and the dynastic Tories at their lowest popular support in 17 years.</p>
<p>An Angus Reid Public Opinion survey of 1,000 decided Alberta voters finds 39 per cent of the electorate would cast a ballot for party leader Danielle Smith and the right-of-centre Wildrose Alliance if they went to the polls today.</p>
<p>The fledgling party is pulling away from Premier Ed Stelmach's Progressive Conservatives, who are tied with David Swann's Liberals for second place, with the backing of 25 per cent of decided voters provincewide.</p>
<p>Brian Mason and the NDP are in fourth spot with the support of nine per cent of Alberta voters, while two per cent said they would vote for another party.</p>
<p>The Wildrose Alliance -- buoyed by their recent leadership race and byelection win in Calgary-Glenmore -- is solidly in first place in every region of the province, according to the poll.</p>
<p>The Tories have slipped to third place in both Calgary and Edmonton amid challenging economic times, and continued public criticism over the government's financial management and H1N1 vaccination rollout.</p>
<p>"It's no secret that the Wildrose Alliance have been gaining momentum," said Angus Reid pollster Hamish Marshall. "Right now, they're on track to form a government."</p>
<p>The current survey data, which reflect similar trending from other recent opinion polls, would put the Wildrose Alliance "right on the line" between a majority or minority government, he said.</p>
<p>But Marshall cautioned the numbers reflect a snapshot in time and that the next provincial election is likely at least two years away.</p>
<p>The latest poll numbers are believed to be the worst for the Tories since 1992, when Laurence Decore's Liberals were in the low 40s, before Ralph Klein's PCs stormed back to win the provincial election the following year.</p>
<p>They also come about a month after Stelmach's own party gave him a 77 per cent vote of confidence in the Conservative leadership review.</p>
<p>The Angus Reid results show support for the Wildrose party is growing in every corner of the province -- at the expense of the Tories, who've ruled Alberta since 1971.</p>
<p>In Calgary, the Wildrose Alliance is backed by 38 per cent of voters, followed by the Liberals with 30 per cent, Conservatives at 23 per cent and NDP at six per cent, according to the poll.</p>
<p>"Clearly people seem to have turned their backs on the PCs and the Stelmach government," Marshall added.</p>
<p>In Edmonton, the Wildrose party leads with 36 per cent support, the Liberals are at 26 per cent, PCs at 25 per cent and NDP at 12 per cent.</p>
<p>In rural Alberta -- historically the bedrock of Tory support -- Smith's party is way out in front with the backing of 44 per cent of voters outside the major cities, compared to 25 per cent for the PCs, 21 per cent for the Grits and seven per cent for the NDP.</p>
<p>"If these numbers are true, it's beyond worry (for the Tories). I think they should be terrified," said David Taras, political analyst at the University of Calgary.</p>
<p>"With these numbers, it's really a race to the bottom, a toboggan ride to nowhere."</p>
<p>One of the most worrisome points for the Conservatives, he said, is that the Wildrose Alliance is leading by large margins in all regions of the province.</p>
<p>While the latest poll results are open for debate, Taras noted one thing that's certain is the trend line for the ruling Conservatives continues to sink -- while the Wildrose Alliance continues to improve -- which indicates changing public opinion.</p>
<p>But the deeper question for the provincial political landscape goes beyond public opinion, to whether Albertans have made a judgment on Stelmach as premier, he said.</p>
<p>"Public opinion can change, but it's much more difficult to change a judgment," he added.</p>
<p>Several question marks remain, however, with the Wildrose Alliance and its leader, Taras said, noting the party still must clearly define some of its policies and carve out an identity prior to the next election, expected in 2012.</p>
<p>What's more, he said Alberta's decreasing voter turnout could also play a large role in whether survey numbers hold true on election day, noting the Tories' sliding poll results prior to the 2008 election before they stormed to a massive majority.</p>
<p>Three separate polls over the past few months have shown a steady decline in backing for the Conservatives and an increase in support for the Wildrose Alliance.</p>
<p>An early October poll conducted by the Citizen Society Research Lab at Lethbridge College found 38 per cent of decided voters would support the Tories, while subsequent polls later in the month from Return on Insight and Environics both had the Conservatives at 34 per cent.</p>
<p>Those same surveys pegged the Wildrose Alliance at 22, 25 and 28 per cent, respectively.</p>
<p>The new Angus Reid online poll of 1,000 randomly selected Albertans was conducted Nov. 23-29 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The regional breakdowns have a margin of error of 5.6 percentage points in Calgary, 5.7 in greater Edmonton and 4.9 in the rest of Alberta.</p>

<p>It concerns me that, in the span of a year, H1N1 has generated a flurry of activity on a scale and at a rate previously unknown.</p>
<p>Yet the Canadian International Immunizations Initiative (CIII), after decades of proven and effective interventions, struggles to maintain their programs.</p>
<p>I cannot understand why we can make every North American aware of H1N1, while CIII struggles for just $2 per Cdn in funding to protect the most disadvantaged on the planet.</p>
<p>The Canadian International Development Agency should recognize the importance of immunization not just at home but to the millions abroad who could never imagine the miracle of modern medicine.</p>
<p>It is time to renew the CIII and CIDA should do the right thing.</p>

<p>An estimated 10,000 people including 1,100 children died of swine flu in the United States in the seven months after the new strain of flu was first detected in April, a top U.S. health official said Thursday. Thomas Frieden, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also told reporters officials estimate there have been nearly 50 million cases, mostly in younger adults and children and more than 200,000 hospitalizations. The number of hospitalizations was around the same as for an entire year when only seasonal flu is circulating, and the estimated death toll was "much higher than in a usual flu season," said Frieden.</p>

<p>Researchers in Vietnam report seven healthy people on a train caught Tamiflu-resistant H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The July event was one of the largest clusters of cases of resistant H1N1 seen so far and the first time so many linked cases have been seen in previously healthy people.</p>
<p>None of them had been on the drug prior to getting sick. An expert with the World Health Organization says the event is a warning that resistant viruses can spread among healthy people.</p>
