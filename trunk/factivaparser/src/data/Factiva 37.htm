<p>Some Ontarians will have to wait until December to get immunized against the H1N1 virus, heightening concerns that flu season could peak before the vaccine is available.</p>
<p>Ontario is rolling out its immunization program in November and December. Those at risk of suffering complications from the virus are at the front of the line for the swine flu shot. Everyone else must wait until more vaccine is available.</p>
<p>"It really is just a matter of weeks between when the first dose of vaccine will be delivered and when the last dose is delivered," the province's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Arlene King, told a news conference Friday.</p>
<p>Ontario's flu season typically peaks in late December or early January. But Canada is seeing higher than normal flu rates for this time of year and it is believed the pandemic's second wave has already hit. King said densely populated areas such as the GTA and Ottawa are seeing the most influenza activity.</p>
<p>"Of course, this is a very different flu season and we just don't know what is going to happen ... Suffice it to say that we will be rolling it (vaccine) out as quickly as we get the product," she said.</p>
<p>Even though pregnant women are among the vulnerable groups who should get the shot first, King confirmed they will have to wait.</p>
<p>Pregnant women are getting a different formulation of the vaccine, one without an adjuvant, or an additive designed to increase the shot's potency and stretch a limited supply further. There is no clinical data about the effect of the adjuvant on pregnant women.</p>
<p>Ottawa had said both forms of the vaccine would be available at the same time, but King said the one for pregnant women won't become available until the week of Nov. 7.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Schabas, formerly the province's chief medical officer of health and now head of the public health unit in Hastings and Prince Edward counties, said the delay in getting the non-adjuvanted vaccine "poses a real dilemma," especially for pregnant women with problems such as diabetes or asthma. This group is particularly at risk for serious complications from the virus.</p>
<p>"That's probably the most important group of all to immunize before the disease strikes," warned Schabas. He is seeking clarification on whether it would be okay to offer them adjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>Noting it takes up to two weeks to build antibodies after being vaccinated, Schabas said anyone planning to get the shot in December may be out of luck.</p>
<p>"It's a definite possibility that we will see most of our disease before we are in a position to immunize very many people," he said.</p>
<p>Still, he said he is not terribly worried about healthy people, because the virus produces only mild disease in most people.</p>

<p>Just about the time the second wave of the H1N1 virus hits, many of us will be thinking about giving the north the cold shoulder and booking a holiday in a hot place.</p>
<p>Escaping the frosty temperatures doesn't mean you can dodge the illness. You can expect the virus to be lurking in crowded airports, on planes and in hotels.</p>
<p>Sure, you can take the usual precautions, sneezing and coughing into the crook of your elbow, carefully washing hands and practising the knuckle bump instead of a handshake or hug.</p>
<p>And getting the vaccine when it becomes available.</p>
<p>But there's one thing many of us often overlook in our haste to beat it to beaches and deserts: travel health insurance.</p>
<p>We might be vigilant about arranging pet sitters and finding the most flattering bathing suit, but not so much at protecting the hard-earned investment in a precious holiday.</p>
<p>A 2008 Ipsos Reid poll conducted for RBC Insurance suggests the topic is not considered as sexy as the bikini you might buy for the trip.</p>
<p>HERE ARE A FEW HIGHLIGHTS:</p>
<p>- Nearly 40 per cent of Canadians never purchase health insurance when travelling on holidays to the United States, where medical costs are some of the highest in the world.</p>
<p>According to the study, a four-day stay in a U.S. hospital for an appendectomy could cost $39,400 US, with only $1,600 Cdn covered by a government health insurance plan, or GHIP. A one-day stay in a U.S. hospital for a broken arm and wrist could cost $32,600, with only $400 covered by a GHIP.</p>
<p>- In a similar study done the year before, it was found that 64 per cent have never purchased travel health insurance when travelling in Canada because a majority -- around 75 per cent -- believe their provincial health insurance plans would cover everything.</p>
<p>In fact, provincial plans often exclude X-rays, dental work, ambulance transportation and prescription drugs. One example cited the cost of an air ambulance with a full medical team travelling from Calgary to Toronto; the $28,000 cost would not be covered by a government health insurance plan.</p>
<p>- Nearly 30 per cent have never purchased travel insurance when travelling outside of Canada or the United States, skewing toward 18- to 34-year-olds.</p>
<p>Another common misconception is that certain credit cards that have travel health insurance cover all costs incurred for illness or injury while travelling.</p>
<p>It's wise to read the fine print because this is often not the case.</p>
<p>tst</p>
<p>Martha Turnbull, president of the Travel Health Insurance Association of Canada, is a nurse who works as a claims assistant in the travel division of RBC Insurance.</p>
<p>I asked her some travel insurance questions relating to H1N1, but the answers would apply to most infectious illnesses.</p>
<p>Q: With all the news about the second round of H1N1, would a traveller who has already booked a trip and bought travel medical insurance be reimbursed if they want to cancel because they are worried about contracting the illness?</p>
<p>A: Typically, no. People can't cancel because they are worried. It has to be a defined situation. In this case, it would be best to ask your travel agent.</p>
<p>Most insurance policies would just change the dates of travel.</p>
<p>Or, if the policy has a "cancel for any reason" clause, the person might be entitled to some money back, but not all of it. It depends on the insurer.</p>
<p>Q: In June, the World Health Organization deemed H1N1 a pandemic. Will travel health policies still cover the illness?</p>
<p>A: I haven't heard of any instances (where it won't).</p>
<p>I can only speak for RBC. (The pandemic classification) does not void any part of the policy.</p>
<p>Q: If I'm advised not to travel and stay in bed when I become ill at a destination, will I be reimbursed for the cost of my extended days in a hotel, plus other expenses incurred?</p>
<p>A: Each company would look at it differently. If someone was ill and was unable to travel home, they would be covered for hotel and food. This is an important point.</p>
<p>Trip cancellation or interference and health coverage will cover the cost to change travel arrangements.</p>

</p>
<p>Health care is bound to re-emerge as a big issue when the legislature resumes Wednesday with the speech from the throne, with the debate taking on a considerably nastier tone than before.</p>
<p>But it won't be the only big theme that consumes the session. So you ask, what are the others?</p>
<p>- The Saskatchewan Party and Premier Brad Wall will try to demonstrate that their government is still putting the people first.</p>
<p>- The NDP and new Opposition Leader Dwain Lingenfelter will attempt to prove that Wall and the government already have embarked on a path of self-interest that gives the Saskatchewan Party's friends precedence over everyone else.</p>
<p>It should be a pretty interesting fight. Each side has a pretty good premise, and this really could prove to be the classic struggle between right and left, and the government and Opposition.</p>
<p>But even if it's not all that interesting, get used to it anyway. You will be hearing these themes repeatedly until the 2011 election.</p>
<p>Ask NDP insiders what this session will be about and they'll tell you it's all about pocketbook issues -- the notion that a lot of citizens out there aren't faring quite as well as those connected to the government, either financially or spiritually.</p>
<p>They will also tell you it will be about leadership and competency -- that a Lingenfelter-led government wouldn't have allowed the province at a time of ample surpluses to get into the budgetary mess that we now see.</p>
<p>Whether or not you agree with their narrative, you can see the soundness of their strategy.</p>
<p>By now, the NDP should know that it will lose, and lose badly, if politics becomes a simple popularity contest between Lingenfelter and Wall.</p>
<p>The premier remains wildly popular, and his party has done a reasonably effective job of redefining Lingenfelter as a less-likable, grumpy old man, even if the "old" part is usually implied.</p>
<p>But whether you find a political leader more likable than his rival is totally different from whether you think that the leader can do a better job of running affairs of state. This is why you've already heard Lingenfelter take direct shots at Wall.</p>
<p>Remember the NDP leader's post-byelection victory comments about Wall being a "loser" and an "pretender"? And it's certainly why the NDP keeps drawing comparisons of Wall to Grant Devine.</p>
<p>Expect to hear a lot about how Wall's government hasn't kept its promise to rural communities (about schools and hospitals that haven't been built), about how he can't write a budget (the $1.3 billion potash revenue gaffe), and about how he can't even fix the mistakes he's made. (The Finance Ministry "cost savings" Friday were mostly about government picking some low-hanging fruit.)</p>
<p>And expect to hear even more about how much better the special interest groups and the Saskatchewan Party's friends are doing.</p>
<p>But don't assume the government will take all this lying down.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan Party insiders say they might take a less edgy approach to needling Lingenfelter, but will hit him hard on his record within the NDP government (Spudco, Channel Lake Petroleum) and in the private sector, such as his flirtation with the Alberta Conservatives and his once very pro-nuclear views.</p>
<p>More critical to Wall and his party, however, will be to avoid getting suckered into mud-slinging, and to stick to their central message that the government hasn't lost touch with voters.</p>
<p>Expect to hear in Wednesday's throne speech a specific plan to reduce surgical waiting lists. Expect next month's mid-term financial statement to get a little more serious about truly saving money.</p>
<p>Don't even be surprised if the government proceeds with, or at least threatens, legislation that could suspend all or some elements of health-care contracts to ensure that workers stay on the job during any H1N1 pandemic -- also in the name of putting people first.</p>
<p>It will get a little noisy and nasty, but it should be interesting to watch.</p>

<p>More than half of the people living in Saskatchewan are concerned they or someone else in their home will become sick with the H1N1 virus, but only one-third plan to be immunized, according to a new survey.</p>
<p>"It's that young group, the 18- to 34-year-olds, that are most likely to say they are not getting an (H1N1) flu shot. It's the 'I'm young, I'm invincible' attitude that they have," said Lang McGilp, manager of research services for Insightrix Research Inc.</p>
<p>Of the 796 Saskatchewan residents who responded to an online poll, 287 (36 per cent) said they plan to get the H1N1 vaccination, 329 (41 per cent) said they don't plan to and 181 (23 per cent) said they didn't know if they would be getting immunized.</p>
<p>People in Saskatchewan feel very informed about the issues surrounding H1N1, according to the poll.</p>
<p>About 95 per cent said they felt somewhat or very informed about ways to prevent catching H1N1, and 84 per cent said they felt somewhat or very informed about the symptoms. About 80 per cent said they felt somewhat or very informed about the risks associated with contracting H1N1.</p>
<p>"We didn't go to the level of depth to test people's knowledge level," said McGilp.</p>
<p>"There's likely an element of inflation there in terms of who says that they are informed versus if we actually tested them on their answers. Not all of them would probably get them all correct."</p>
<p>Not only did nearly 83 per cent of those surveyed report they believed it was within their control to reduce the chances of getting sick with H1N1, many also said they have changed their behaviour to reduce their exposure to the virus. More than 83 per cent said they were washing their hands more often, 69 per cent of those with kids in their home said they are either washing their kids' hands more often or telling their kids to do so and more than 17 per cent said they are drinking hot liquids and/or gargling with salt water or antiseptic more often than they normally would.</p>
<p>Of the women surveyed, 43 per cent said they will stay home from work if they are sick this winter, compared to 31 per cent of men who plan to stay home.</p>
<p>"The likelihood of avoiding the workplace if ill is lowest among households earning less than $30,000 in annual income (29.1 per cent), and the likelihood of staying home if sick increases sharply with household income (to a high of 53.1 per cent of those with household incomes of more than $120,000)," said the report prepared by Insightrix.</p>
<p>The Saskatoon-based research firm has developed an online market research panel that includes more than 6,000 Saskatchewan residents.</p>
<p>The firm randomly selects from this panel those who participate in online surveys.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Government cuts spending; Belt-tightening due to miscalculation of potash revenues</b>
</div><div>James Wood </div>
<div>The StarPhoenix</div>
<div>936 words</div><div>17 October 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>
</p>
<p>Saskatchewan is nearing an economic contraction for this year and more government budget cuts could be forthcoming, Finance Minister Rod Gantefoer said Friday as he introduced $102 million in spending reductions.</p>
<p>The spending cuts are part of belt-tightening measures in response to a major miscalculation of potash revenues, which the Saskatchewan Party government announced in its August first-quarter financial report would be $1.3 billion lower than projected in its April provincial budget.</p>
<p>Gantefoer said Friday that potash revenues are likely to be even less than the reduced $637-million figure from the first quarter.</p>
<p>That will likely play a role in moving the government's economic growth forecast down even farther from its current projection of 0.6 per cent, a figure itself lowered from the budget's 2.1 per cent growth estimate.</p>
<p>"You can't take $1.3 (billion) or $1.5 (billion) or whatever the number will settle out to be out of the provincial government revenue and not expect there's some impact broader than that on the economy," Gantefoer said in a news conference at the legislature.</p>
<p>"We're getting close to the edge of it, but I don't know those numbers. We will be in a better position to tell at mid-year," he added, when asked about the likelihood of negative economic growth this year.</p>
<p>While some private-sector analysts are already predicting an economic contraction for the province, the finance minister pointed out that Saskatchewan's finances and economy both remain among the strongest in Canada. He noted the government received a boosted credit rating and strong praise from the Dominion Bond Rating Service on Thursday.</p>
<p>But Gantefoer acknowledged that while Friday's budget cuts were sufficient in terms of the first-quarter report, more may be needed as the financial picture develops through the year.</p>
<p>Besides "further downward pressure" on revenue, there may be "upward pressure" on expenses. For example, the province has estimated the potential price tag of dealing with the H1N1 pandemic at $32 million, but that money has not been booked into the budget.</p>
<p>The Opposition NDP was critical of the government's potash and economic growth projections at the time of the provincial budget.</p>
<p>Finance critic Trent Wotherspoon told reporters Friday the government was in trouble of its own making and he was concerned about the impact of further cuts.</p>
<p>"With the numbers we've received from this government and how highly inaccurate they've been to date, it's very difficult to say whether or not these are the steps that are actually going to right the mistakes to date," he said.</p>
<p>The government may also be prepared to reverse the Sask. Party's long-standing aversion to government spending more than it is taking in to its general revenue fund, even if reserves are used to balance the budget. After two years in office, Gantefoer said he may have been wrong to describe that practice as running a deficit and said he hasn't ruled out drawing down on the Growth and Financial Security Fund in order to balance the budget this year.</p>
<p>To finance a debt paydown, that fund was reduced from $1.2 billion to $840 million in at the first quarter, a point where the government was pegging its surplus at a slim $50 million.</p>
<p>With budget deliberations for the 2010-2011 fiscal year beginning, Gantefoer said the government intends to reduce spending and take a more prudent approach compared to this year's budget, which saw 20 per cent of expected revenues coming from potash.</p>
<p>"We thought we were being cautious at the time. In hindsight, we were wrong. That's clear."</p>
<p>The spending cuts announced Friday include $8.4 million from "vacancy management" -- a hiring freeze for some jobs that has seen the equivalent of 142 full-time civil service positions not being filled. Gantefoer said many of those positions could potentially be eliminated permanently through the budget process.</p>
<p>As well, $1.6 million has been saved through civil service travel restrictions.</p>
<p>The government also found $8.1 million in program reductions, including $5 million from savings identified in non-clinical programs from the health regions.</p>
<p>But while the $102 million is just over double the government's original target for cuts, most of the savings appear likely to have happened whether there was a restraint policy in place or not.</p>
<p>The province is saving $32.1 million in deferred capital costs for the Academic Health Sciences Building at the University of Saskatchewan, noting that the money is not needed until 2011-2012. A further $3 million in deferrals comes from slower-than-expected construction progress at the ambulatory surgical care centre in Regina.</p>
<p>With the government touting $2.5 billion in infrastructure spending in its first two budgets, Gantefoer said capital spending will be lower in 2010-2011. The deferred spending on ongoing projects will have "first call" on capital funds, he said.</p>
<p>There was also $48.4 million in forecast savings from programs where utilization was less than originally anticipated, including $20.4 million from agriculture and $9 million from environment due to lower than budgeted firefighting costs.</p>
<p>Gantefoer said the difference is that in some cases in the past the savings would have remained with the ministries to be used for other purposes.</p>
<p>The restraint package announced in August also included deferring funding for the planned children's hospital in Saskatoon and taking more money from Crown corporations.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Supplies stockpiled to fight H1N1</b>
</div><div>Lana Haight </div>
<div>The StarPhoenix</div>
<div>676 words</div><div>17 October 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>
</p>
<p>Saskatoon Health Region is stockpiling supplies and equipment to the tune of $6.9 million as part of its H1N1 pandemic plan.</p>
<p>"It is not budgeted because it was not something that was known at the beginning of the fiscal year," said Deb Rhodes, vice-president of finance and administration at Saskatoon Health Region.</p>
<p>"We are hopeful and expecting that it will be funded (by the provincial government)."</p>
<p>But even with the additional purchases, the health region won't have an endless supply of all items.</p>
<p>"Limited resources will be a reality during a severe outbreak of influenza," said a report prepared by health region senior administrators and submitted to the Saskatoon Regional Health Authority at its regular public meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Of concern is the number of ventilators available for patients suffering from severe respiratory problems. The region has purchased eight new ventilators, bringing to 82 the total number of machines located in the three Saskatoon hospitals.</p>
<p>The provincial government has additional respirators to be used by the health regions.</p>
<p>The report says during the course of the pandemic, as many as 298 to 880 people in Saskatoon Health Region could be hospitalized with influenza-like illness.</p>
<p>At the meeting Tuesday, health authority member Carol Teichrob wondered which patients will receive priority treatment if a choice has to be made.</p>
<p>"There is potentially an ethical dilemma here," answered Sandra Blevins, vice-president of clinical and operations support services.</p>
<p>The health region is waiting for the provincial government to provide clinical guidelines for the use of ventilators, such as which patients require a ventilator and when. Those guidelines will be based on several ethical principles: Protect and promote the public's health; ensure equity and distributive justice; respect the inherent dignity of all persons; use the least restrictive means; optimize the risk/benefit ratio; and work with transparency and accountability, said the report received by the health authority.</p>
<p>In addition to stockpiling supplies in anticipation of an influx of patients with influenza-like illness, the health region is ramping up its regular inventory.</p>
<p>Normally, the health region stocks about five days' worth of supplies. This fall, it has begun purchasing eight and 12 weeks' worth of some supplies that will be needed to treat other patients, such as those who receive routine kidney dialysis.</p>
<p>"We need to be prepared in case there is a supply chain disruption," said Rhodes.</p>
<p>That disruption could be caused by large numbers of employees becoming sick at any point in the chain -- at the supplier, the transportation company or the health region itself. Increased demand for certain supplies might also result in shortages.</p>
<p>The $6.9 million the region expects it will spend in the coming months is broken down into three areas: $1 million for equipment such as beds and IV pumps, $4.5 million for medical/surgical supplies, food, housekeeping and other supplies and $1.2 million for pandemic planning and for salaries associated with that planning and the hiring of additional nurses to conduct immunization clinics.</p>
<p>Additional supplies purchased include: 2.5 million pairs of gloves, two million syringes, 150,000 blood collection tubes, 30,000 catheters, 9,600 isolation gowns and 3,000 bottles of hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>"If we don't see a significant increase in usage of those products, that's really only a cash cost to us. It won't actually affect our bottom line, because all it will mean is that at the end of the year we'll have more inventory on hand than we normally do," said Rhodes.</p>
<p>In that case, the additional expense will be limited to the $1.2 million spent on planning and additional salaries, she says.</p>

<p>The Notre Dame Hounds' athletic season is on hold.</p>
<p>All the Hounds' athletic competitions -- including Friday's scheduled Regina Intercollegiate Football League game against the Luther Lions -- have been cancelled or postponed until at least the middle of next week.</p>
<p>Officials at Athol Murray College of Notre Dame made the decision in consultation with the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region and the school's medical personnel due to concerns arising from the H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, there have been five confirmed cases of H1N1 within the student body at the Wilcox-based residential school. Those five students have recuperated following a seven-day quarantine, but caution is being exercised because a few of their classmates have flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"We're interested in the health of our kids and other kids,'' Notre Dame president Rob Palmarin said Friday. "We're not in panic mode. We're in precautionary mode.''</p>
<p>Palmarin added that, as of Friday, 14 of Notre Dame's 320 students were being treated by Notre Dame's health care nurses. A majority of those patients were experiencing flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>For the time being, Notre Dame is distancing itself from the outside community until the symptoms subside. This policy is in effect for five days, beginning Friday, after which the situation will be reviewed. The objective is to speed up the recovery process and reduce the possibility of the illness spreading. All visitors to Notre Dame are being advised of the situation.</p>
<p>"The majority of our students are healthy,'' Palmarin emphasized. "We had classes all week and we plan on having classes on Monday. We plan to go to church on Sunday.</p>
<p>"We're going to stay home -- kind of like in a Regina bungalow, but the neighbours aren't going to come over. That's kind of how we're approaching it.''</p>
<p>When possible, the affected sporting events will be rescheduled. One exception will be the RIFL game against Luther, which was to be the regular-season finale for both teams. Officials from Notre Dame and Luther College High School mutually agreed that the game would be declared a tie.</p>
<p>"It was their initiative,'' said Palmarin, who commended the Luther administrators for their sportsmanship.</p>
<p>With a victory, Luther could have supplanted Notre Dame as the third-place team in the Stewart Conference. Instead, Notre Dame remains in third and Luther stays in fourth. Both teams are scheduled to participate in first-round playoff games on Thursday.</p>
<p>"It's not our fault and it's not their fault,'' Luther principal Mark Anderson said. "The health of the kids comes first. That's the bottom line.''</p>
<p>The Hounds' soccer program is also affected. The Regina High Schools Athletic Association's 2A girls soccer final, between Notre Dame and the Miller Marauders, was to be played Monday. The game has been moved to Wednesday, 5 p.m., at Mosaic Stadium, contingent upon Notre Dame athletes receiving clearance to resume competition.</p>
<p>Notre Dame had qualified three runners for the Saskatchewan High Schools Athletic Association cross-country championships, to be held today in the vicinity of the Canada Games Athletics Complex. As a precaution, those runners will be withheld from the provincial meet.</p>
<p>The SHSAA cross-country meet was to have been held in Wynyard, but was moved to Regina on short notice because a 16-year-old student at Wynyard Composite High School died after contracting the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>RHSAA volleyball matches involving Notre Dame's junior and senior girls teams have also been affected.</p>
<p>In addition, the health situation affects Notre Dame's many hockey teams, including the SJHL's Hounds, and the Saskatchewan Midget AAA Hockey League's Hounds and Argos. A postponement will also impact Notre Dame's entry in Regina Minor Football's bantam division.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hogwild for cheap pork; H1N1 scare drives down prices of tenderloin, chops and boneless roasts, prompting thrifty shoppers to fill their freezers</b>
</div><div>Paula McCooey </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>593 words</div><div>17 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>E1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>With a drop in demand locally and across the pond, pork has become an economical choice for the dinner table.</p>
<p>Experts and retailers cite many reasons for pork's declining popularity. One is this year's emergence of the pandemic H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, which has wreaked psychological havoc on consumers around the globe.</p>
<p>And there's the weak export demand driven by the economic downturn and stricter guidelines for farmers selling to the United States.</p>
<p>Some shoppers have been taking advantage of the cheap prices and stocking their freezers with premium cuts, including pork tenderloin, boneless chops and roasts. Others are bypassing pork altogether and buying more poultry, lamb and beef.</p>
<p>At Aubrey's butcher shop in the ByWard Market, pork sales are down signicantly since last October. Owner Brian Kennelly says his customers don't come right out and say it, but he suspects it's because of the public's concern over H1N1.</p>
<p>"My pork sales are down about 25 to 35 per cent," says Kennelly, whose pork prices have stayed the same for the past two years. "But my other sales are up so people are buying lamb or beef or more chicken."</p>
<p>Patrick O'Neil, sales manager for Ontario Pork, says even though it's common knowledge that people can't contract H1N1 from eating pork -- a fact reiterated by the World Health Organization -- sales are down, especially outside Canada, in countries such as China and Russia.</p>
<p>"It's a known fact that you can't get the H1N1 virus from eating pork. It's clear there should be no reason to be concerned about H1N1, but people are still staying away," says O'Neil, noting that pork prices are typically more reasonable at this time of year because there are more pigs going to market.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of August, O'Neil says hog prices have averaged about $100 per animal, a decrease of about $50 over the same period last year.</p>
<p>"It's just a huge drop year over year," he says. "And the Ontario government estimates that the cost of production is over $160 per animal. So you are looking at about $60 a pig that producers have lost on every animal they've shipped since the beginning of August."</p>
<p>At Saslove's Meat Market in the ByWard Market, owner John Diener has cut his pork prices by 10 per cent. Though down, his sales are offset by an increase in demand for lamb, fish and veal and other poultry products such as Guinea hens and pheasants.</p>
<p>"Pork is pork," Diener says. "But it's certainly more economical than most meats."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Institutions brace for flu outbreak; Hospitals on alert as rate of sickness rises, while colleges and universities deal with early illnesses</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1027 words</div><div>17 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>D1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>With early signs that flu is on the rise among children and young adults in Ottawa, hospitals are bracing for more cases, while universities and colleges are putting their pandemic plans to the test.</p>
<p>"We're on alert that activity is increasing, and we don't want to get caught off-guard in terms of the system being overloaded," said Thomas Hayes, who chairs a citywide committee of emergency planners from hospitals, nursing homes and other health-care providers.</p>
<p>The illnesses raise the possibility that Ottawa is dealing with H1N1 swine flu, but because health officials are not routinely testing for the virus unless patients have been hospitalized, precisely what is making people sick isn't certain.</p>
<p>Unlike other flu viruses, H1N1 is known to infect children and young adults more than the elderly, who appear to have some immunity to the virus.</p>
<p>So far, sporadic cases of flu-like illness have shown up at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario and Carleton University, which have reported slightly higher rates than other hospitals and post-secondary schools. Almost all cases appear to be mild, with people recovering without obvious complications.</p>
<p>Since the start of the school year, eight students who live on campus at Carleton have come down with a flu-like illness, including three this week, said university spokeswoman Lin Moody.</p>
<p>Seven have since recovered, while one remains in isolation. Moody said the university "is not seeing any abnormal levels of illness on campus."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CHEO has reported a "significant increase" in the number of children at its emergency department, with up to 15 per cent screening positive for a flu-like illness. That translates to about 20 cases a day, out of an average of 150 children who show up daily at CHEO's emergency room.</p>
<p>The rate is higher than that of The Ottawa Hospital, Queensway Carleton Hospital and Montfort Hospital, whose emergency departments have seen less than five per cent of patients with flu-like illness, said Hayes.</p>
<p>Since Sept. 1, Ottawa has had 10 flu cases requiring hospitalization, suggesting a majority of the illnesses have been mild. Over the same period, the city had 27 lab-confirmed H1N1 cases and one death, according to Ottawa Public Health.</p>
<p>CHEO's unusually busy month has caused longer-than-average delays for people waiting to be treated in the emergency room.</p>
<p>While Algonquin College has not noticed any suspected cases among the 1,000 students in residence, the school has seen a "slight increase" in students with flu-like symptoms at the campus clinic, said Dr. Rick Rowland, manager of health services.</p>
<p>Over the past week, the clinic has seen between four and six cases of suspected flu, but none was considered serious enough to warrant antiviral medication as a treatment, Rowland said.</p>
<p>The University of Ottawa has so far not received any reports of flu-like symptoms among its residential students, said Michael Histed, director of risk management.</p>
<p>However, over the past two weeks, up to four staff members have been sick with suspected flu, said Histed.</p>
<p>Public health officials in Ottawa have asked schools to notify them any time more than 10 per cent of their students are absent. Such absenteeism rates would trigger an investigation by public-health officials into a possible outbreak.</p>
<p>But because universities and colleges rarely track attendance, officials are relying on a range of crude indicators for early warning about any potential spike in illness.</p>
<p>As a first line of defence, the schools rely on designated student advisers who live in residence to monitor the health of their peers.</p>
<p>In addition, the University of Ottawa is launching a website where students, whether they live on or off campus, can report signs of illness. Officials are also monitoring absenteeism rates in select classes, such as law, where attendance is mandatory.</p>
<p>For students living on campus who report symptoms, the university hands out infection-control kits containing hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes; the number of kits handed out gives officials a rough idea of the scope of illness among students in residence, said Histed.</p>
<p>At Algonquin, no formal systems monitor the health of students who live off campus. Instead, the college focuses on tracking the health of students who live on campus.</p>
<p>"The residence is actually a pretty good proxy for the general population," said Brian Burns, who's responsible for pandemic planning at Algonquin.</p>
<p>If the college receives enough reports of illness, officials can activate an automated voice messaging system that calls every room and asks students to respond to a survey of flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>The schools appear to be at varying levels of readiness when it comes to responding to suspected flu outbreaks among students living on campus.</p>
<p>At Carleton, four "isolation areas" have been set aside in residence buildings that can accommodate up to 40 students, said Moody. Because a majority of the residences have shared rooms, such areas are aimed at separating sick students who share rooms with healthy students.</p>
<p>At Algonquin, every student in residence is given a private room in a two-bedroom suite, meaning sick students who need to isolate themselves would have little trouble doing so, said Burns.</p>
<p>The situation is different at the University of Ottawa, where the majority of students live in shared rooms, and there are no sick bays set up in the residences.</p>
<p>Histed said in a worst-case scenario, the university might look into relocating sick students to another facility on campus.</p>
<p>For the time being, officials are relying on sick students to isolate themselves and healthy roommates to keep their distance and practise preventive measures such as handwashing, said Histed.</p>
<p>The university is also increasing how often shared washrooms are cleaned to minimize the spread of infection.</p>

<p>Dr. David Scheifele is a pediatric infectious disease specialist and director of the vaccine evaluation centre at British Columbia's Child and Family Research Institute. Ran with story Our best shot against swine flu?</p>
<p>Scheifele is leading an independent, nationwide study of the effectiveness and safety of the H1N1 vaccine, produced by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, once it is approved for use in Canada. Among other things, Scheifele will look at the effect of the adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine on children under three. Here, Scheifele offers some advice for pregnant women and parents of young children who are weighing the risks and benefits of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Citizen: If a pregnant woman were seeking your advice about whether to get the H1N1 vaccine, how would you counsel her?</p>
<p>Scheifele: I would certainly encourage pregnant women to get the unadjuvanted vaccine, realizing it's basically the same formulation as seasonal influenza vaccines, which we have been recommending for pregnant women for some time.</p>
<p>We do know they are at increased risk of influenza complications, particularly in the third trimester. So if I were counselling a pregnant woman, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the unadjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>Citizen: How would you counsel parents of children under the age of three?</p>
<p>Scheifele: That's a tough question ... There has been particularly little study of the under-three age group so there isn't a body of evidence on how well they tolerate adjuvanted flu vaccines. That's an area where one would really like to know the results of the clinical trials that are in progress because that age group is at high risk for H1N1 infection and hospitalization. But they're also a group that responds poorest to the seasonal influenza vaccine. So they could potentially benefit substantially from the adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>My advice to parents would be to prefer the non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine, if it's available to them. But if they have an opportunity to enrol their child in a clinical trial of the adjuvanted vaccine, they should go for it.</p>
<p>Citizen: For children under three, what are the theoretical side effects of the adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>Scheifele: It would be in the same order that we're seeing in (children aged) three to five. They'll have injection-site discomfort. That will make them irritable, cranky, perhaps (causing) a disturbed night of sleep. Giving analgesics should help with that, if it's troublesome. In the three to fives, fever has been an infrequent complication. Only about two per cent of that age group has fevers. Fevers scare parents, but physiologically, it's not all that distressing. And it's treatable with fluids and drugs like Tylenol.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Our best shot against swine flu?; With the federal government poised to inoculate Canadians against swine flu, there are safety concerns about an ingredient in the H1N1 vaccine. Science suggests adjuvants are the way of the future, but as Pauline Tam explains, some fear that what we don't know about the immune boosters might hurt us</b>

<div>2634 words</div><div>17 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>If, as expected, the H1N1 vaccine finally arrives in November, a majority of Canadians will be offered a flu shot that, for the first time, contains an immune booster designed to make the vaccine more effective.</p>
<p>The booster is derived from a natural oil called squalene, which belongs to a class of compounds known as adjuvants.</p>
<p>Somewhat mysteriously, these adjuvants increase the immune system's response to vaccines. Scientists are convinced they will play an increasingly important role in improving existing vaccines while developing new shots to fight all kinds of diseases.</p>
<p>Dr. Scott Halperin, director of the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology in Halifax, calls adjuvants "one of the most important things in the future."</p>
<p>But as Canada prepares to immunize as many people as possible against swine flu, adjuvants are at the heart of a medical dilemma. While they promise to increase the H1N1 vaccine's potency, their safety is not entirely proven. In particular, there is little hard scientific evidence about their effect on pregnant women and newborns. Some animal studies have raised the possibility that adjuvants might cause auto-immune diseases.</p>
<p>Because of those uncertainties, the U.S. -- unlike Canada and some European countries -- has decided against buying adjuvanted vaccines.</p>
<p>The tradeoff is, the U.S. vaccine could turn out to be less effective, especially in children and pregnant women, who tend to have weaker immune systems. A less effective vaccine would put two already vulnerable groups at greater risk.</p>
<p>The dilemma highlights the uncertainties facing public health officials, who are dealing with incomplete, at times conflicting medical evidence.</p>
<p>For Canadians struggling with whether to get vaccinated for H1N1, the situation is even murkier. Some fear the safety of the vaccine more than the actual flu, while others are confused about the risks and benefits. As a result, a large portion of the public appears reluctant to take the vaccine.</p>
<p>According to experts, flu vaccines that do not contain adjuvants simply don't work well. "What people don't appreciate is that the influenza vaccines that we routinely use are among the weakest of the regularly used vaccines," said Dr. David Scheifele, director of the vaccine evaluation centre at British Columbia's Child and Family Research Institute.</p>
<p>Scheifele points to studies that show even the best unadjuvanted flu vaccines only protect six out of 10 people who get the shot; in vaccines that are poorly matched against a flu virus, the protection rates could be as low as three in 10.</p>
<p>Experts believe an adjuvanted flu vaccine could boost protection rates to as high as nine in 10.</p>
<p>During a pandemic, such odds would be particularly good news for children and pregnant women, who are at significantly greater risk.</p>
<p>But while these groups stand to benefit most, little research has been done on how they respond to flu vaccines that contain adjuvants. "In the past, we've unfairly excluded these populations in medical research," said Dr. Jeff Kirby, a bioethicist at Dalhousie University. "And that's why we don't have much information on women and children as we do on men."</p>
<p>As part of the drug approval process, clinical trials for Canada's H1N1 vaccine, set to start this week, are expected to include a small number of children as young as six months, who will be given the experimental vaccine produced by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>.</p>
<p>Pregnant women will be excluded from the studies, largely because of the "theoretical" possibility that any medication given to them could harm the fetus.</p>
<p>As a result, vaccine makers typically avoid testing experimental drugs on pregnant women out of fear of being sued, said Halperin, whose lab is leading the safety and effectiveness studies of Glaxo's H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Scheifele is conducting a separate, federally funded study on the H1N1 vaccine once it has been approved for use in Canada. He said while there are few real or specific safety concerns about giving adjuvanted flu vaccines to pregnant women, more research is needed to prove they are "safe enough." What little research has been done suggests there are more benefits than risks.</p>
<p>A study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that newborns can be protected from seasonal flu when their mothers are vaccinated during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Such immunity typically lasts until a baby reaches six months, said Scheifele. After that, additional flu shots are needed to once again build up an infant's immune response.</p>
<p>The problem is, existing flu vaccines have little effect on newborns, pointing to a need for more research. "The reason we don't give it to them is not because of a safety concern," said Halperin. "It's because it doesn't work."</p>
<p>For now, out of an abundance of caution -- and to ease public fears about vaccine safety -- the Public Health Agency of Canada is giving pregnant women, who might otherwise choose not to be vaccinated, the option of getting an unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>It's unclear whether the same option will be extended to young children. Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, has stated that children under three would also have the choice of getting an unadjuvanted vaccine. But neither the vaccine experts nor public health officials across the country have been told about the policy change.</p>
<p>"Ottawa Public Health eagerly awaits this information and expects it to be available in the near future," said Barre Campbell, spokesman for the city's public health unit.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada issued a statement Friday, saying Canada's 1.8 million doses of unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine is being considered for use in children under three. "Once the vaccine is approved for use in Canada, final recommendations for who should receive which type, and how many doses are needed will be made," said agency spokeswoman Nadia Mostafa.</p>
<p>Not only do adjuvants have the potential to save the day in this pandemic, experts believe they will play an increasingly important role in next-generation vaccines against all kinds of diseases.</p>
<p>"Improving adjuvants in order to make vaccines that are even more effective in children will be a big driver of that," Halperin said.</p>
<p>Vaccines once typically contained a weakened or killed virus, or antigen, to spur an immune response. Some newer vaccines consist of only proteins from an antigen, which make them purer, safer and quicker to produce.</p>
<p>But it turns out the missing parts of the antigens also help to jumpstart the immune system; without them, an adjuvant is needed.</p>
<p>To date, only one vaccine adjuvant -- aluminum hydroxide, or alum -- has been approved for use in Canada. It's found in such common vaccines as pneumonia, tetanus, diptheria and polio, which are routinely given to children. But even though it's used widely, alum is comparatively weak and only works with certain vaccine viruses.</p>
<p>The squalene adjuvant in Canada's H1N1 vaccine, developed by Glaxo, is called AS03. It's found in a vaccine approved in Europe for use against the H5N1 bird flu, which spurred fears of a pandemic several years ago.</p>
<p>That work has given Health Canada, the country's drug regulator, access to some data on the safety and effectiveness of Glaxo's squalene adjuvant.</p>
<p>According to Scheifele, who is familiar with the data, close to 40,000 Europeans, including seniors and young children, have been given Glaxo's adjuvanted bird-flu vaccine, with few adverse effects reported.</p>
<p>While adjuvants tend to increase the temporary pain and swelling where the shot is given, the main concern is whether they might cause an autoimmune disease, like rheumatoid arthritis. Some animal studies have suggested that possibility.</p>
<p>Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration stopped a clinical trial of a hepatitis B vaccine containing a new adjuvant after one participant developed a type of blood-vessel inflammation that is considered an autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>But the drug regulator lifted its hold last month, apparently satisfied the vaccine was not the cause.</p>
<p>Experts say there is no cause for concern with the swine-flu vaccine. Scheifele points to the safety record of another squalene adjuvant, found in a seasonal flu vaccine produced by <span class="companylink">Novartis</span>.</p>
<p>Since it was approved for use in Europe in 1997, more than 22 million people, mostly seniors, have been vaccinated with the adjuvanted flu vaccine, with few signs of problems, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>So if squalene is a safe and effective adjuvant for flu vaccines, why has it not been approved previously for use in Canada?</p>
<p>The answer has less to do with vaccine safety than with the changing way officials view flu as a public health threat, said Scheifele.</p>
<p>He explained that for decades, officials have targeted flu vaccines at seniors and people with chronic illnesses.</p>
<p>With such a small segment of the population taking the flu vaccine, manufacturers had little financial incentive to develop adjuvants and then go through the expensive process of seeking government approval.</p>
<p>But with a greater awareness among public health officials that flu is a significant disease and more Canadians need to be protected from it, vaccine makers have ramped up research into adjuvants.</p>
<p>"Those are relatively new developments," said Scheifele. "It has made people realize that we're making broad use of a vaccine that's short of ideal, and that needs fixing."</p>
<p>Even so, scientists are still learning how adjuvants work and how to devise them in more systematic ways than by trial-and-error.</p>
<p>"I think the use of adjuvants in flu vaccines is the way forward," said Scheifele. "Five years from now, it won't be an issue for discussion. We'll have figured out how to do it, when to use it and how to improve protection rates."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Q&A</p>
<p>What are the possible side effects of the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>The side effects are expected to be similar to those from seasonal flu vaccines. The most common are soreness, redness, tenderness or swelling where the shot was given. Some people might experience headache, muscle aches, fever, nausea and fainting. If these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and may last as long as two days. While vaccines can cause allergic reactions, life-threatening allergies are rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot is given.</p>
<p>After vaccination, look for any unusual conditions, such as a high fever. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, swelling around the eyes or lips, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart or dizziness. If any unusual conditions occur following vaccination, seek medical attention right away. Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened and when the vaccination was given.</p>
<p>Are there some people who should not get the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>People who have a life-threatening allergy to chicken eggs should not be vaccinated because the viruses used to make vaccines are grown in chicken eggs.</p>
<p>What is squalene?</p>
<p>Squalene is a naturally occurring oil found in plants, animals and humans. It is manufactured in the human liver and circulates in the bloodstream. Squalene is also found in foods, cosmetics, over-the-counter medications and health supplements. Squalene found in vaccines is commercially extracted and purified from fish oil. Since 1997, squalene has been approved for use in a flu vaccine in Europe.</p>
<p>Why is squalene added to vaccines?</p>
<p>Squalene is a component of an adjuvant that is added to vaccines to enhance the body's immune response. When combined with other compounds, squalene improves the body's protective response in people with weak immune systems, such as young children, the elderly, pregnant women and cancer or HIV patients.</p>
<p>What is known about the safety of squalene in vaccines?</p>
<p>One example of a squalene-based adjuvant is MF59, produced by <span class="companylink">Novartis</span> and added to its flu vaccine targeted at those older than 65. More than 22 million Europeans, mostly seniors, have been given this adjuvanted flu vaccine, and to date, experts have not observed severe side effects linked to it. Some mild, localized swelling has been observed. Clinical studies on squalene-containing vaccines have been done in babies without evidence of safety concerns.</p>
<p>If squalene is such a safe and effective adjuvant for flu vaccines, why has it not been approved previously for use in Canada?</p>
<p>Until recently, vaccine manufacturers have not considered it a worthwhile business decision to submit new adjuvants for flu vaccines to drug regulators for approval. That's because the market for seasonal flu vaccines, aimed primarily at the elderly and people with chronic diseases, is relatively small.</p>
<p>But two key developments have changed that. First, there is emerging medical evidence that flu is a significant disease worth preventing in a larger share of the population. At the same time, existing flu vaccines, which don't have adjuvants in them, simply don't work that well. At best, unadjuvanted flu vaccines protect against disease about 60 per cent of the time. As more is known about the role adjuvants play in making more effective vaccines, they will become increasingly important for vaccines against all kinds of diseases, including flu.</p>
<p>What is thimerosal?</p>
<p>Thimerosal is a mercury-based antibacterial agent that has been used for decades in vials containing more than one dose of some vaccines. The preservative, which will be in H1N1 vaccines, is used to prevent the growth of bacteria that could contaminate the vaccine and cause illness or death.</p>
<p>In recent years, thimerosal has been phased out of routine vaccines given to children and adults, largely because vaccine manufacturers have moved toward producing single-vial vaccines or pre-loaded syringes. The few exceptions are the seasonal flu vaccine and most hepatitis B vaccines, which still contain thimerosal.</p>
<p>What is known about the safety of thimerosal in vaccines?</p>
<p>Unlike methyl mercury, which can cause brain injury, thimerosal is derived from ethyl mercury, which is not a neurotoxin. In trace amounts such as those found in a vaccine, thimerosal is a biodegradable compound that's quickly excreted from the body.</p>
<p>The best available scientific evidence to date shows no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and any adverse health condition, including neurological disorders like autism. In Canada, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization has reviewed the safety of thimerosal and concluded that there is no "legitimate safety reason" to avoid the use of thimerosal-containing products for children, seniors or pregnant women.</p>
<p>In the U.S., three government agencies -- the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute of Health -- have reviewed the published research on thimerosal and found it to be a safe product to use in vaccines. Another three independent organizations -- the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American Academy of Pediatrics -- reviewed the published research and also found thimerosal to be a safe product to use in vaccines. International bodies such as the World Health Organization share this opinion.</p>

<p>Kaylann and Sylvie Daigle learned how to walk at the same time.</p>
<p>Kaylann was 11 months old. Sylvie, her mother, was 27.</p>
<p>At an Ottawa rehabilitation centre, Sylvie would be strapped into a harness and held up by two people as she struggled to put one foot in front of the other.</p>
<p>Move, she silently willed her feet. Please, move.</p>
<p>On Oct. 6, 2004, the Ottawa woman woke with a tingling in both hands. She assumed she had slept on them. It never occurred to her to worry.</p>
<p>But the numbness and tingling grew worse as the day wore on. That night, when she stepped under the shower, the water felt like nails against her skin.</p>
<p>She went to an emergency room, where the doctor said it looked like multiple sclerosis, and sent her home with instructions to see a neurologist. Don't worry, the doctor told her. MS is slow moving.</p>
<p>By the next morning, Sylvie was back in emergency. Her legs felt heavy and the numbness was creeping up her arm and into her chest.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes after the triage nurse took her information, Sylvie heard her name called. When she tried to get up, she couldn't move. Her legs were paralysed. She kept rocking in her seat, trying to stand. "It was as if I had no legs."</p>
<p>From there, "it went really fast."</p>
<p>"The nurses threw me into a wheelchair and I went to the ICU. There were doctors all around me, plugging me into things. A doctor said, 'Close your eyes,' and he grabbed a needle and scrubbed the bottom of my feet. He said, 'Do you feel anything?' I said, 'No, what am I supposed to feel?' "</p>
<p>It was 10:30 a.m. By 3 p.m., Sylvie was paralysed from the neck down. The cells in her peripheral nerves were being attacked by her own immune system, including the nerves that supply the muscles that make her lungs inflate. The doctors discussed cutting a hole into the trachea in her neck, to help her breathe.</p>
<p>Sylvie was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that hospitals and doctors across Canada are being told to be on the lookout for when H1N1 vaccinations begin in November.</p>
<p>Sylvie and other GBS victims worry many doctors may not know it to see it.</p>
<p>In 1976, when swine flu was found in soldiers at Fort Dix, New Jersey, the U.S. government launched a mass vaccination of more than 40 million people against a pandemic that never happened. The shots were halted after 10 weeks, after 532 new cases of GBS were discovered during active surveillance for reactions to the shots. According to World Health Organization experts, for no clear biological explanation, the shots increased the risk of GBS in adults within the first six weeks following vaccination.</p>
<p>As Canada prepares for the largest vaccination program in the nation's history, health officials are rushing to implement enhanced surveillance systems to check for GBS and other potential "adverse events" when the shots are released in November.</p>
<p>"When you're starting to look at rare side-effects, those are the things that we'll only pick up when we start immunizing," said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>In an electronic age, rumours spread fast, and Butler-Jones is already cautioning against blaming the shots for what may be purely coincidental. Once large-scale vaccinations begin, "some of us in this country will develop something like Guillain-Barre, or stroke or heart attack," he said this week. "If we happened to have gotten the vaccine that day, or the day before, sometimes we jump to the conclusion that maybe it was the cause.</p>
<p>"The key is to look at (normal background) rates of these potential issues ... and if they're the same whether you got the vaccine or not, it's not the vaccine."</p>
<p>GBS is an inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nerves, those outside the brain and the spinal cord. The disorder attacks myelin, the sheath that forms around nerves like insulation around a cable. GBS strips the myelin off the axons, the "wires" that connect neurons. When the myelin goes, the nerves stop conducting and the muscles become paralysed.</p>
<p>Slowly, the nerves regenerate. But sometimes the damage is so severe, it can produce wide and fatal fluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure and breathing.</p>
<p>The mainstay treatment is IVIG, or intravenous immunoglobulin, a mixture of antibodies pooled from human blood that calms the inflammation. Recovery may take weeks, to months, to sometimes years.</p>
<p>"The typical case is somebody who is in reasonably good health, or in excellent health, who suddenly realizes that they can't walk, or they're stumbling, or they have weakness in their hands or arms," said Dr. Neil Cashman, professor of neurology at the University of B.C. "This can progress over the course of days to weeks, until there is severe paralysis of all four limbs, the muscles of the face, and the muscles of breathing."</p>
<p>Overall, about one to two people per 100,000 each year develop GBS. One Canadian study estimated flu vaccination increases the risk of developing the syndrome by 45 per cent, which translates into about one additional case</p>
<p>per million people vaccinated.</p>
<p>"I'm getting phone calls (from GBS patients). 'What do we do? Do we take this (H1N1) vaccine?' " said Susan Keast, executive director of the GBS/CIDP Foundation of Canada. CIDP, or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, is a chronic form of GBS. "There are people who had a flu shot before who swear they got it from that. It comes up every year, more so this year because of H1N1."</p>
<p>According to Keast, perhaps 50 per cent of GBS cases occur shortly after a viral or bacterial infection, such as a cold, sore throat or the flu. (Sylvie remembers having sinus pain before she got sick.) Immune cells called lymphocytes become confused and, instead of attacking the virus, attack the nerves. Vaccines, which stimulate the immune system, may induce the same misguided response, experts said.</p>
<p>"For the general public, I think the risk is really low," said Dr. Vera Bril, head of neurology at the University Health Network, Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. "I don't think it's zero. But the concern about this has to be balanced out against having a bad dose of flu, if you get flu." For people with advanced lung or heart disease, influenza can be fatal.</p>
<p>"The risk, I think, is in someone who has a proven abnormal immune system, and has chronic types of GBS, or has had GBS in the past, and they're terrified they're going to get it again," Bril said. "That becomes a little less harder to predict. I think everybody has to check with their own doctor."</p>
<p>Cashman said it is important that there be heightened awareness about GBS. Keast agreed. She developed GBS in 1989, after an upper respiratory flu "that went on the whole winter." The first time she went to the emergency room with pain in her back and</p>
<p>tingling in her arms, "they thought I'd put my back out." Then it crept up her arms.</p>
<p>She had two more trips to the emergency room. "The third time they kept me, because I couldn't move at all."</p>
<p>Keast said GBS victims have been told that they were just stressed, or that it is all in their head and should see a psychiatrist. "People get sent home four or five times, until all of a sudden they fall on their face and then the emergency room will say, 'My God, there really is something here we need to look at.' "</p>
<p>Symptoms include progressive weakness, "foot drop" (catching a toe at a curb, or on a step), weakness in the arms and legs, difficulty climbing stairs, combing hair or opening a jar. Facial weakness occurs in most cases. People can't smile, frown or close their eyes completely.</p>
<p>"The only mistake you can make with Guillain-Barre is to not diagnose it, or not diagnose it in time," Cashman said.</p>
<p>Sylvie spent three weeks in hospital, three months in a rehabilitation centre and then 18 months as an outpatient. She had to learn how to walk again, brush her teeth, wash her face and hold a pen. She walked with a cane up until two years ago. She remembers the humiliation of having to be fed, of being moved by a hydraulic lift from her hospital bed to a wheelchair, and the pain of not being able to feel her then-10-month-old daughter when her husband laid Kaylann in her arms. She lost 20 kilograms in the first three months of her illness.</p>
<p>Today, she lives with chronic nerve pain in her legs and hips. She's on a waiting list for injections that make the pain just barely tolerable. She had another episode of GBS this past summer. Luckily, she said, "I didn't lose function, it didn't spread to the lower extremities." Still, it was 24 hours before the emergency room doctors were convinced it was GBS, and started treatment.</p>
<p>Sylvie said she won't get an H1N1 flu shot. "But that's a personal decision," she said.</p>
<p>"I made a promise to myself, that if I ever walk again, I will do whatever it takes to keep whatever doesn't belong in my body out of it."</p>

Daigle will never forget the heartache of being unable to feel her
little girl, Kaylann, in her arms when she lay in a hospital bed in
2004, paralysed by Guillain-Barre syndrome. She had to learn to walk
again while Kaylann, then 11 months, was taking her own first
steps.

<div id="hd"><b>Confusion is spreading faster than the flu itself</b>
</div><div>JOSH FREED </div>

</p>
<p>Please wash your hands before reading this column to avoid the flu. When emailing this column, please use an anti-virus program to avoid spreading Flu-oogle.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is the worst flu epidemic we've faced in decades, but it's definitely the most indecisive.</p>
<p>When is it coming, is it coming and which shot should we get? Are old people immune to the new flu because they had the old flu? Or is it just a fluke?</p>
<p>The confusion over the new flu dates all the way back to its original name, swine flu, a catchy term that scared us effectively but quickly offended pigs, hog, sows, boars and other swine.</p>
<p>So authorities went back to flu-naming headquarters and changed it to the bureaucratic H1N1, which sounds like a postal code, so very few of us call it that. We've stuck with swine flu, while the media call it H1N1 and the French media call it grippe A.</p>
<p>It's arrival was confusing, too. Last spring the new flu was supposedly coming fast, an epidemic so terrible authorities branded it a "worldwide danger to mankind," as bad as the 1918 flu that killed one-third of Europe and more than 50 million people.</p>
<p>But so far, luckily, it's been a relatively mild version that's killed about 5,000 worldwide. This has made many people cynical about whether it's a killer flu or a Y2K flu.</p>
<p>Also confusing is how to prevent it. The government ran a huge TV campaign urging us to wash our hands as often as Lady Macbeth. Now, everywhere I go people are hesitant to shake hands and eager to bump fists. Hand sanitizers are spreading so fast they'll soon outnumber hands in Canada.</p>
<p>But lately there's been scientific word that hand contact isn't how flu germs spread best. Most are airborne and spread by sneezing and coughing - but how do you protect against that? How far does a sneeze travel? Or a cough? Or a conversation?</p>
<p>What is the velocity of a major sneeze, and how far should we stand from a serial cougher? Two feet or 20? What about other confusing behaviour - like the two-cheek kiss? If you're standing behind a cougher who kisses someone's cheek, should you kiss the same check - or is it contaminated? How much air should there be in an air kiss?</p>
<p>Even France has launched a campaign to kiss off the kiss, with headlines comparing it to the "kiss of death."</p>
<p>How far can this paranoia go? Some have suggested a general quarantine where we all stay home. After all, if we don't go to movies together, shop together, share the bus together, or go to classes and jobs together - how can the flu spread?</p>
<p>Then again, if no one goes out and spends money, we may go into another recession and come down with affluenza.</p>
<p>The latest confusion is over flu shots. There are two shots - one for new flu and one for old flu. Should we take one, or both, and which one first? The U.S. and many other countries have started to give mass vaccinations for both flus. But Canada is cautiously waiting till November, for more data - because one Canadian study claims people who take the old flu shot might have more chance of catching the new one. This has confused everyone.</p>
<p>Several provinces are now delaying the old flu shot till they give the new one, but others are offering the old shot now. Some are giving the old shot to old people and the new shot to "new" people. Quebec, distinct as ever, won't offer the old shot till the New Year, when regular flu season might be over.</p>
<p>The confusion among authorities has fostered so much indecision that almost half the population have told pollsters they aren't sure they want any shot at all. The minister of health is touring the country urging everyone to get their H1N1 shot - but last Wednesday, normally decisive Stephen Harper waffled so much on CBC that many people think he won't take his flu shot, either.</p>
<p>About the only people who aren't confused are conspiracy theorists who send me emails every day. They're convinced swine flu is just a scare to make money by "big government" and "big drugs." But these are often the same people opposed to measles, mumps and smallpox vaccinations, or who believe the 9/11 attacks were planned by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Not me. I started taking flu shots 15 years ago and haven't had the flu since. I'm happy to take the new flu shot, the old flu shot and a third shot that protects against financial flu and Flu-oogle.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll go to Burlington for the weekend.</p>

<p>VANCOUVER</p>
<p>Eric Sedore was working on a family cruise ship touring Europe in August 2005 when passengers started vomiting.</p>
<p>The Norwalk virus had rocked the boat.</p>
<p>"There were people throwing up everywhere. And they made a special team of people set up to deal with any cases," Sedore recalled.</p>
<p>"If you saw anybody sick or there were people barfing -- 'Stay away from it, don't touch it, call this number' and they'll come and clean it up with disinfectant."</p>
<p>Though it was likely no more than 10 people were ill, the Sapphire Princess hoisted up the "sick ship" flag to signal passengers in quarantine, and as a result, the 2,000 people aboard were refused visits to Portugal and Spain.</p>
<p>"They got a five-and-a-half day cruise, not seven, and it wasn't even enjoyable," Sedore said, adding when the ship returned to shore, the crew sterilized it top to bottom.</p>
<p>This travel season, another bug is threatening. Canadian health officials are mounting a campaign warning the public that a second wave of the pandemic H1N1 flu virus could strike as winter draws nearer, leaving no place untouched, including cruise ships, planes and trains.</p>
<p>But despite the ample breeding ground offered by such confined spaces, members of the domestic travel industry say they're more than ready to set sail after weathering the first wave of the virus last spring.</p>
<p>"In the first wave, it was a concern because it was an outbreak and it was reported a little late and there was no vaccine at the time," said Shawn Kilner, owner of Cruise Holidays based in Nanaimo, B.C.</p>
<p>"Now they have knowledge, they have awareness, they have medical savvy. So definitely, there is concern, but now it's well-known and there are solutions to it, as much as there can be."</p>
<p>Cruise ships, known to be hit particularly hard if a virus attacks on-board, already follow stringent dining and cleaning policies to prevent outbreaks, Kilner said.</p>
<p>Yet, when H1N1 struck last spring, new measures were created by the North American regulatory body Cruise Lines International Association and quickly put in place to keep the virus at bay.</p>
<p>Prior to boarding at any port, all passengers are now screened using a health questionnaire. If any flu-like symptoms are reported, such as fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat or the person has been in contact with someone who has a confirmed case of H1N1, they'll undergo a second screening.</p>
<p>Medical personnel make case-by-case decisions and can refuse boarding to a passenger for having a suspected case.</p>
<p>If passengers fall ill during their trip, they could be isolated for five to seven days. During that time, they'll be treated by medical staff and have their comfort needs attended by staff.</p>
<p>Should an extreme outbreak occur and more people become sick than staff can handle, ambulances will transport travellers to local health facilities.</p>
<p>At major airports, like those in Vancouver and Toronto, plenty of hand sanitizer has been made available to flyers and regular cleaning has been bumped up another notch.</p>
<p>Heather McCarley, manager of emergency planning at Vancouver International Airport, said all the players met earlier this month as part of a routine exercise to discuss their roles should sickness occur, like several youth from a baseball trip falling ill while in transit.</p>
<p>Airlines can refuse to let flyers aboard if they present risky symptoms, he added.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'Bad idea' to dole out flu drug as preventive</b>
</div><div>Carmela Fragomeni </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>

<p>Local and provincial health officials say a Union Gas plan to dispense stockpiled antiviral drug Tamiflu to its employees to prevent the spread of H1N1 is wrong-headed.</p>
<p>While Union Gas spokesperson Andrea Stass said the stockpiled Tamiflu would only be used in the event of a severe pandemic, a letter given out to employees suggests it would be used as a preventive measure.</p>
<p>"It's designed to ensure we can keep employees safe and also keep our services operating, like providing hot water."</p>
<p>Public health officials disagree with the approach and say Tamiflu and other antivirals are for treating the flu and H1N1, not for preventing it. The H1N1 vaccine being rolled out the first week of November is for prevention.</p>
<p>Using Tamiflu and other antivirals to try to prevent the flu "is not in any way appropriate," said Chris Mackie, Hamilton's associate medical officer of health. The danger is that the virus can develop a resistance to it and health officials could end up with an outbreak of antiviral resistant H1N1, he said.</p>
<p>"It's a really bad idea."</p>
<p>Union Gas has an emergency supply of Tamiflu, but employees will need a prescription from their doctors to get access to it.</p>
<p>Local health officials became aware of the plan after being informed by three Hamilton physicians who received the prescription request from their patients.</p>
<p>Businesses are free to stockpile emergency supplies of antiviral drugs as long as an occupational health physician oversees the acquisition and dispensing of the drugs. But the province has the authority to commandeer the stockpiles if needed.</p>
<p>Roche Canada, which makes Tamiflu, stopped its program for companies to stockpile the antiviral once the World Health Organization declared H1N1 a serious pandemic.</p>
<p>"We have always maintained that in a pandemic situation, the priority is to governments and hospitals," said Roche spokesperson Laura Pagnotta.</p>
<p>At Union Gas, Tamiflu would be dispensed only "where the company, in consultation with the public health officials, deem appropriate" and "in consultation with the company medical adviser and/or a pharmacist," according to a letter given to employees to take to their doctors for a prescription.</p>
<p>Stass stressed the taking of Tamiflu is entirely voluntary for the company's 2,300 employees. The company has asked them to discuss Tamiflu with their doctors.</p>
<p>Mackie said developing a resistance to Tamiflu "would be a real problem because we don't test for resistance on a regular basis. You may be on Tamiflu for weeks before you discover you're resistant ... and by then, the ideal time of treatment has passed." One could then become very ill, he said.</p>
<p>Mackie said he doesn't foresee a severe problem with H1N1 "in the short term."</p>
<p>"With this (H1N1) virus, especially with the vaccination available, the antiviral (drug) does not play a role."</p>
<p>Mackie said he has heard that other companies are thinking of using antivirals as a prevention and said Hamilton Health Sciences has a stockpile, but is not planning to use them this year.</p>
<p>Hydro One spokesperson Daniele Gauvin said: "Similar to other utilities, we do have a stockpile of antivirals. But we are following the current advice of public health authorities and we don't anticipate having to use them."</p>
<p>Public Health Agency of Canada spokesperson Caroline Grondin said widespread use of antivirals for prevention is not recommended -- except "under a limited number of circumstances where the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks."</p>
<p>Ministry of Health spokesperson David Jansen said using Tamiflu as a prevention measure is wrong.</p>
<p>"It is best used as a treatment within the first 48 hours of getting the flu."</p>

<p>MONTREAL -- Unshackled from the restraints of presidential office, Bill Clinton dropped any pretence of neutrality on the national-unity file yesterday and bluntly welcomed an undivided Canada.</p>
<p>Using the podium of an honorary-doctorate ceremony at McGill University, the former U.S. president seized on the august occasion to highlight Canada's perennial national-unity debate.</p>
<p>“You have occasional votes about whether you ought not to be together,” he told about 700 people in the audience. “I'm glad you didn't get a divorce,” he said, prompting applause.</p>
<p>In a tacit acknowledgment that he had to hold his tongue in office, he added: “The great thing about not being president is you can say whatever you want.”</p>
<p>Endorsements from American presidents were hotly sought by both sides during national-unity crises, but U.S. leaders tended to steer clear from appearing to meddle in Canada's internal affairs.</p>
<p>Mr. Clinton did offer carefully worded support to the federalist side during his presidency, notably in Mont Tremblant in 1999 when he held up Canadian federalism as a model for the world. But the foreign-policy mantra of the United States has been to support Canadian unity while leaving it up to Canadians and Quebeckers to decide.</p>
<p>Yesterday's nod to federalism was only one of several references to Canada in an acceptance speech that dwelled broadly on the theme of working for the global common good.</p>
<p>Ushered into the hall by a Black Watch piper, Mr. Clinton was draped with a red-and-white degree hood over his university robes and proceeded to speak for an hour without notes.</p>
<p>His free-flowing dissertation touched on global warming, solar flashlights, AIDS in Africa, community lotteries in Holland, language diversity in Papua New Guinea and the swine flu in New York.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pregnant women face delayed delivery of flu vaccine; Another wait expected for vaccine for vulnerable groups</b>

<p>VANCOUVER and TORONTO -- Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq says H1N1 vaccines – including one tailored for pregnant women – will be available by the first week of November, even as provincial health officials warn of a delay of up to two weeks between the general vaccine and the one designed for use by vulnerable groups such as expectant mothers.</p>
<p>In September, federal health officials said they would have a small store of vaccine without adjuvant (an additive used to boost the vaccine's power) available for “vulnerable groups” – specifically pregnant women – at the same time as the general vaccine. This was being done as a “precautionary measure” since there are no clinical data about the effects of adjuvant on expectant mothers.</p>
<p>Now, senior public health officials in Ontario and British Columbia say that goal won't be met. That would leave pregnant women in Canada with the difficult choice of opting for immediate inoculation when the general H1N1 vaccine becomes widely available in late October or early November, or wait for the vaccine that federal health authorities recommend for expectant mothers.</p>
<p>However, Ms. Aglukkaq said yesterday at a Vancouver press conference that the federal government is still planning to release both vaccines at the same time. “We in Canada are on track to get the vaccine out the first week of November and we will continue to work to meet that timeline,” she said, describing the talk of a two-week gap as “a lot of speculation.”</p>
<p>David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, did not go as far as that, saying that it's not yet possible to say when the vaccine without adjuvant will be available. But Dr. Butler-Jones stressed that pregnant women should take the vaccine that is immediately available, since the risk of complications from an H1N1 infection are elevated for expectant mothers.</p>
<p>However, Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said her office recommends that pregnant women wait for the vaccine without adjuvant – although she expects that Health Canada will shortly issue guidelines for the inoculation of expectant mothers.</p>
<p>Other health officials say they believe both vaccines are safe for pregnant women to use, but a delay would mean patients would have to wait a number of days for inoculation if they didn't wish to take a vaccine with an adjuvant.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, which is contracted to produce pandemic flu vaccine for all Canadians at its Quebec plant, would not comment directly on the situation, saying in a statement that it would meet the timelines set by the federal government.</p>
<p>Perry Kendall, British Columbia's provincial health officer, said it became apparent in early October that the vaccine for pregnant women would not be available at the same time as the general vaccine with adjuvant.</p>
<p>For physicians, the discrepancy between the earlier message that the adjuvant-free vaccine is preferred, and the new reality that a vaccine with adjuvant may be all that is initially on hand points to difficult conversations with pregnant patients.</p>

<p>THE city's decision to put paramedics in factory-issue sedans is such an obvious and smart move, it makes you wonder why no one thought of it before. Do we really need a two-person, fully-equipped $250,000 ambulance dispatched to every cry for help, particularly when most aren't emergencies?</p>
<p>The numbers tell the story. The Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service responds to 78,000 medical calls a year and transports about 60,000 people to hospital. Of those, only 10 per cent, or about 6,000, are critically ill with potentially life-threatening injuries. It's obvious that many people can be treated in their homes in a more affordable and efficient manner than is now the case.</p>
<p>The paramedic service wants to acquire one Ford Focus for a pilot project in northwest Winnipeg and, if it proves its value, expand to a fleet of four sedans.</p>
<p>The timing of the proposal, which requires provincial approval, is linked to the anticipated increase in medical calls as a result of both the seasonal and H1N1 flu. The service estimates it will receive about 15,000 flu-related calls this season, but if there is a larger outbreak, it wants permission to increase the number of cars immediately.</p>
<p>The paramedic-in-a-Focus will act much like a triage nurse in determining the level of emergency. If a trip to the hospital is indicated, a full ambulance can be summoned, or the paramedic could even drive the patient to the hospital.</p>
<p>The service eventually wants the ability to connect electronically with emergency rooms to increase communication with doctors and experts. In some cases, all a client really needs is an appointment with a doctor, and not a wild ride to the hospital with sirens blaring.</p>
<p>The new service model, assuming it is fully developed, should remove pressure on emergency rooms and paramedics, while enhancing care. The new scheme does not involve flashing lights, sirens or speeding. That makes it more appealing for clients who don't want the neighbourhood to know their problems.</p>
<p>The province should ensure paramedics have the training they need for the new response system and then promptly approve it.</p>

<p>Residents of the Hamilton-Burlington area will soon be faced with the question of whether to be vaccinated against H1N1 flu. Even more pressing, local parents will need to decide whether to have their kids vaccinated or, in the case of parents of young adult children, whether to urge them to get the shot.</p>
<p>It's an individual, or family, decision. But, on balance and considering the best evidence available at this time, it makes more sense to get it than not. And certainly people considered to be at higher risk, such as pregnant women, should be vaccinated. As well, those of us who work or are otherwise interactive with a group or groups of people should be aware that we have a collective responsibility to our colleagues and associates, not to mention families and friends.</p>
<p>The most current information from national and world health authorities says between 30 and 50 per cent of the population is expected to get H1N1 by the time the pandemic is over. Most cases in Canada so far have been mild, but there have been 79 deaths since the spring. Most experts agree that while this flu is generally not overly serious in general, it can be deadly in certain cases, and to people who would not ordinarily be vulnerable to death from other strains of flu. This includes healthy young people -- two 15-year-olds recently died, one in Timmins, one on the Prairies -- and pregnant women. Other flu strains, sometimes called seasonal, claim many more lives every year, but typically the deaths are clustered in patients whose health is already compromised by advanced age or other health conditions.</p>
<p>Skeptics and cynics about H1N1 and vaccination in general raise several points. They question use of adjuvants in the H1N1 vaccine. (Adjuvants are additives that boost the body's response, requiring less vaccine and thus stretching the supply.) But numerous tests and due diligence by experts and public health officials agree it's not an issue. They worry about elements of mercury being contained in an ingredient that acts as a preservative. But the same element -- thimerosal -- is found in greater quantities in regular food items such as fish, milk and cereal. They worry about the risk of serious illness and side-effects. Experts don't deny there is a small degree of risk with any vaccination, but point out the risk of serious illness from flu is much greater.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that, based on evidence to date, it's hard or impossible to predict which otherwise healthy flu victims will suffer serious, possibly life-threatening, complications from H1N1. That alone makes vaccination the best, if not perfect, choice available.</p>
<p>But we also need a huge injection of common sense. A Quebec survey tells us that 25 per cent of respondents said they would not stay home, even if diagnosed with H1N1. That's just stupid. People with symptoms need to stay home until the symptoms abate, and employers need to stress that, or face even bigger problems down the road.</p>
<p>We don't need panic. We do need clear-headed thinking, and a recognition of our collective as well as individual responsibility to deal intelligently and responsibly with the flu pandemic.</p>

</div><div>The Canadian Press</div>

</p>
<p>VANCOUVER</p>
<p>The "second wave" of the H1N1 flu has arrived in Canada, with British Columbia reporting eight deaths.</p>
<p>Health officials say the new flu outbreak is unprecedented for the province this time of year.</p>
<p>Federal health officials are assuring the public that pandemic preparations are in place, even as they warned that other provinces should expect to see an increase in the number of H1N1 cases themselves.</p>
<p>Ontario has already reported a spike in flu-like activity, while reports of the deaths of 11 children in the U.S. in the past week sparked fears the long-feared resurgence of the pandemic strain of the virus is here.</p>
<p>"British Columbia is now well into what we might call the second wave of the H1N1 pandemic," Dr. Perry Kendall, B.C.'s provincial health officer said.</p>
<p>"Compared to the rest of the country we are seeing significantly higher numbers of influenza-like illness at this time. Our rates of prescribing of antivirals have gone up to about 5,000 a week."</p>
<p>Kendall said that while the flu rate in the province is unprecedented for this time of year, it is not unprecedented for a flu season. Seventy-eight flu patients have been hospitalized so far this fall.</p>
<p>Kendall said it's not unusual for influenza to affect one area, and leave others relatively unaffected -- at least for now.</p>
<p>"Somebody has to be first," he said.</p>
<p>Kendall, who was joined at the news conference by federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and national public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones, said the B.C. disease control laboratory is testing about 700 samples every day. About half are testing positive for influenza and most of those are the H1N1 strain.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada says there have been 80 H1N1-associated deaths recorded in the country to date.</p>
<p>But Aglukkaq said while Canadians should do their best to remain informed of H1N1, they can rest assured that the proper preparations have been made at the federal level.</p>
<p>"We have stockpiled antiviral medications in strategic locations throughout the country so that they can be distributed quickly, even to isolated communities if they are needed," she said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta announced some swine flu vaccines may be delayed because manufacturers can't produce them as quickly as hoped, but Aglukkaq and Butler-Jones were adamant all Canadians will get them if they want them.</p>
<p>"We in Canada are on track to get the vaccine out the first week of November and we will continue to work to meet that timeline as agreed to with provinces and territories," Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>The pandemic vaccine purchased for most Canadians will contain an adjuvant, an additive that boosts the impact of a vaccine, which allows a smaller dose.</p>

</div><div>Joanna Frketich  </div>

</p>
<p>The second wave of H1N1 is spreading through Hamilton with 10 to 20 new flu cases in the last week.</p>
<p>"Usually we expect zero at this time of year," said Dr. Chris Mackie, associate medical officer of health. "There's something circulating when there really should be nothing."</p>
<p>Four people with H1N1 have died in Hamilton since July. The pandemic flu caused or contributed to three of those four deaths.</p>
<p>Right now, there is little Hamiltonians can do to protect themselves because the H1N1 flu shot won't be available here until Oct. 26 at the earliest and possibly not until November.</p>
<p>"We're working together to accomplish getting the vaccine out as soon as possible," said Mackie.</p>
<p>There have been 32 people hospitalized in Hamilton. Two-thirds of them have been women and slightly more than that had underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>Outbreaks have been declared in 10 local schools since September and two day cares.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the province issued new guidelines to help public health departments prevent and manage H1N1 at hospitals, emergency departments, long-term care centres and primary care facilities such as doctors' offices.</p>
<p>The most significant recommendations were: having people infected stay home until they have gone 24 hours with no symptoms; urging health-care workers to use masks and gloves when treating anyone with fever and/or cough; and the incubation period for H1N1 has been estimated at four days.</p>
<p>"Those are a big help," said Mackie.</p>
<p>"They're a lot more clear in terms of what people should be doing in the health-care community. They clarify some of the issues where we've had different guidance from different places."</p>
<p>Hamilton has had no further cases of Tamiflu-resistant H1N1 since a Hamilton man in his 20s caught it at the beginning of August. Public health officials didn't get confirmation it was resistant to the antiviral treatment until Oct. 9 because it takes weeks to get test results.</p>
<p>Despite it being the first case of Tamiflu-resistant H1N1 in Ontario, public health officials didn't feel it was significant to report earlier than the next regular Thursday media briefing Oct. 15 because it's believed to be contained.</p>
<p>Mackie said the man's flu symptoms resolved, but wouldn't give his current condition or say whether he is alive or dead.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people lined up in the cold at only four locations in a city of a million or so. The most vulnerable (the elderly, the very young, etc.) are encouraged to attend and this is the best they can do for them? And Dr. Judy MacDonald is thrilled while seniors are chilled? Chestermere no doubt added to the lineups as we received no clinic at all this year and were referred to the Calgary clinics. Cochrane, Airdrie and Strathmore all have clinics, but the Chestermere clinic was cancelled. Will it be the same story for the H1N1 shots? The whole setup seems a little Third World to me.</p>

</p>
<p>Decorating a home while keeping all the design rules in mind is like juggling chainsaws while running on a rolling log, and balancing a beach ball on your nose. To get a space just right, you have to manage all this:</p>
<p>-Make sure your furniture layout functions, flows and has good feng shui.</p>
<p>-Co-ordinate your colour palette, following a monochromatic, two-tone, or triad scheme, while factoring in a perfect-pitch neutral.</p>
<p>-Pick a design style--country, traditional, modern, ethnic or eclectic--and stay faithful.</p>
<p>-Mix curved with straight lines, layer lighting, add accessories to scale and don't have so many furniture legs that the place looks like a Rockettes' routine.</p>
<p>Do all this while holding down a day job and a marriage, coordinating kids' homework and soccer practice; getting 30 minutes of aerobic exercise and five servings of vegetables a day; and combating cellulite, errant eyebrow hairs, swine flu and rising household costs.</p>
<p>And I almost forgot until someone had the nerve to remind me, you have to factor in texture.</p>
<p>Texture! Who has time for texture? It's not that I don't think about texture. Texture becomes an obsession to women-of-a-certain-age, when the middle age fairy comes and changes your skin from permanent press to "needs ironing."</p>
<p>But texture in home design? Somebody give me a martini.</p>
<p>My texture alert came in the form of an e-mail I received from Thibaut, a wallpaper company, promoting its new line of (very textural) grasscloth wallpaper ( thibautdesign.com).All the rooms pictured were lovely, of course, but the style secret was texture. "Texture is everrrreeething," oozed New York-based interior designer Eileen Griffin, author of Design Rules, due next month from Gotham Books. "It's so overlooked, yet so easy to do and so important."</p>
<p>I'm relieved we're on the phone and she can't see my house. I look around. If I got the textural touches right anywhere, I credit luck, not skill. Well, I do have silk pillows on my damask duvet cover, and a polished ceramic dish on my distressed wood kitchen table, so that much is right. But I've also put a light green faux suede pillow on my dark green faux suede chair. (Ding!)</p>
<p>"Throw pillows should never be the same fabric as what they're thrown on," says Griffin. "Fabric finishes need to contrast!"</p>
<p>I knew that.</p>
<p>Then she got to the heart of why texture is so essential to good interior design: "People always say they want rooms that look warm and think they get that with colour, but they don't," says Griffin. "Warmth is always achieved with texture."</p>
<p>I want an example. "You could be Nanook of the North living in an all-white igloo, and the space could feel like the warmest place in the world with the right textures." She would install a white fur rug, a white ultrasuede sofa, and white nubby chenille and boucle pillows, but then would add a glass coffee table so all finishes weren't matte.</p>
<p>Sure, I got a few moves right at my place with a little luck and a smidgen of instinct. But now that I know better, I'm off to change that faux suede pillow right now.</p>
<p>In case you want to add another chainsaw to your design-juggling act, here are some texture tips from Griffin.</p>
<p>Rules to follow:</p>
<p>-Mix it. Rooms need yin and yang. Texture isn't all rough and fuzzy. It's shiny and smooth. Every room needs a blend: something shiny and something matte, something ornate and something with clean lines. Too much rough texture--wool sofas, tapestry covered walls, Aubusson rugs--makes a room feel stuffy. Conversely, when everything is smooth and shiny, the place looks like an oil slick.</p>
<p>-Make every surface count. When decorating or updating a room, consider the textures on walls, furniture, floors and accessories. Be particularly aware of what's next to what. For instance, if your coffee table is glass, put something dull on it, like woven baskets or leather-bound books.</p>
<p>Ways to toss in texture:</p>
<p>-Add throw pillows that contrast with what they're thrown on. So no wool pillows on a wool sofa. Use silk or cotton pillows instead; put linen or chenille on leather.</p>
<p>-Fling a mohair throw over the back of a chair.</p>
<p>-Hang textured wallpaper, such as grasscloth. The look is back with a vengeance and does not look like it looked in the '70s.</p>
<p>-Lay down an area rug. Solidcolour sisal is always sophisticated, as are patterned wool rugs.</p>
<p>-Supply shine. If most items in the room are dull, add a mirror, a glass vase, or a bowl of polished apples.</p>

<p>Forget the huge ambulance. Forget the lights and sirens. Forget the long wait to be handed off to an emergency room doctor.</p>
<p>Winnipeg paramedics could soon arrive at the door in a much homelier vehicle--a Ford Focus. If the provincial government approves the idea, a paramedic could be sent by car to triage and treat some of the thousands of non-life-threatening cases called in to 911 every year.</p>
<p>The move is part of a new plan meant to reduce pressure on city emergency rooms, ease the chronic shortage of paramedics and cope better with the looming H1N1 flu pandemic. Paramedics could be cruising the city in the sedans by the time the worst of the pandemic hits, said Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service Deputy Chief Ken Sim.</p>
<p>The city would still send a full-scale ambulance to critical cases, such as heart attacks or car accidents. Those are only about 10 per cent of the cases medics attend.</p>
<p>The new "community paramedics" would act more like nurses who make house calls, responding to a whole host of less serious cases that don't need a$1-million ambulance, two highly trained medics and an automatic trip to the nearest emergency room. That includes everything from worrisome flu to sprained ankles, diabetes and seizures.</p>

<p>- How come it's only politicians and rich people who say the recession is over? - Has Premier Stelmach never heard of the Edmonton Oilers? Since I was forced to choose between his speech or the hockey game, you can guess which one I ended up watching. - I have never seen a 16-minute TV address go so wrong. There was not one positive thing that came out of it. - I would have felt more comfortable with our premier's speech if he was at his farm, shovelling out the cow barn. - It's time to decide on a theme song for the upcoming Tory leadership review. I'm leaning toward that tune from the Titanic movie. - Mr. Stelmach, please tell me there is more to your economic recovery plan than a hope for voluntary pay freezes from the very public employees your government has mistreated and vilified. - Oh, the pain of freezing your salary after giving yourself a 34-percent increase. Bring on the crying towels.</p>
<p> - I wonder if Premier Stelmach ever heard the old saying that if you give a man enough rope, he'll hang himself. Ed, you just did. - I've been angry and exasperated with the provincial Tories at different times over the years, but the current crop honestly frightens me. - Not all of us public employees get bonuses. Only management gets them. - I work for the provincial government and I have no problem with the voluntary pay freeze. At least I have a job to go to every day. - The premier freezes salaries so he won't have to lay people off. At the same time, we are grappling with the cost of the H1N1 flu vaccine. Yet the city is spending $43 million on the zoo?Oh my word, somebody save us. - City council could have saved taxpayers substantially more than$43 million by giving the Valley Zoo what it really needs: a fleet of bulldozers. - So the Bright Lights Festival at Hawrelak Park is finally over. I admit it was fun to go see before the cost got too high. Maybe we can now get the ice open for skating before Christmas. - I've told ETS about their faulty online trip planner several times in the past three months, but they think I'm crazy. - I was in Chicago in August and used their transit website to get around that city with no problem. Edmonton should copy their design and then test the site to make sure it works before releasing it to the public. - The Oktoberfest parade in Kitchener was televised nationally. It was a fabulous event that includes no less than 15 marching bands. I hope Northlands was watching. - Why can't they build an underground electricity line from Edmonton to Calgary and put the bullet train on top of it?That would be a win-win situation. - The only way speeders are going to get the message is to impound their cars and take away their licences. First offence equals one week; second offence is one month. - Greenpeace is doing to the Alberta oil industry what it did to the Newfoundland seal hunt: spreading untruths to the gullible. Eventually they won in Newfoundland. Be afraid, Albertans, be very afraid. - The controversially premature awarding of the famed Nobel Peace Prize to U.S. President Obama has effectively outed the award as the grand liberal backslapping event I've long considered it to be. - Do all these cold-water laundry detergents still kill germs?

<div id="hd"><b>Tweet-happy talent could be a help or hindrance; Twitter leaks news that networks would rather manage themselves</b>
</div><div>Scott Collins   </div>
<div>Los Angeles Times</div>
<div>597 words</div><div>17 October 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>D7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>

<p>Twitter has roughly six million users, and probably upward of 99 per cent of their tweets attract absolutely zero attention. But the rules are a little different for the people who make TV shows, as Hart Hanson, creator and executive producer of Fox's forensic comedy-drama Bones, learned earlier this month.</p>
<p>Hanson, an active Twitterer known for his gently ironic on-set updates and affectionate exchanges with the show's hard-core fans, informed readers that his show had shut down production. "Damn swine flu!" he added.</p>
<p>Later, he admitted that he did not really know if anyone on his set had the H1N1 virus, although star David Boreanaz was out sick. But by then the tale was in full gallop of how Bones was felled by the dreaded swine flu.</p>
<p>"Glibness and irony, probably not the best idea for Twittering," a chastened Hanson said in a later interview.</p>
<p>The entire entertainment business is struggling with the best way to use Twitter, the micro-blogging service founded in 2006 that has been embraced by many celebrities as a way to pitch themselves and their projects. And TV is in many respects on the front lines, given that the talent has fresh episodes of shows to promote every week.</p>
<p>The acceptance of the format goes well beyond Ashton Kutcher--who, by the way, has nearly four million Twitter followers. Take, for example, Lea Michele, the young star of Fox's Glee, who tweeted about the show's mall tour this past summer. Tracy Morgan, of NBC's 30 Rock, has quickly drawn a Twitter crowd this month with baffling and often-ribald posts.</p>
<p>Then there are tweeting producers, such as Carlton Cuse of ABC's Lost and Bill Prady of CBS's The Big Bang Theory."</p>
<p>But as the Hanson case illustrates, there's a danger in giving platoons of highly opinionated actors and writers a filterless forum where even their half-formed thoughts can be seen instantly by millions.</p>
<p>Casting news that networks would rather manage themselves has been leaked via Twitter.</p>
<p>Ryan Seacrest was the one who broke the news that his friend, former NBC executive Ben Silverman, was exiting the network. When NBC suddenly axed its cop drama Southland recently, Sons of Anarchy writer-producer Kurt Sutter thundered that network czar Jeff Zucker was a "rudderless buffoon." One network PR person described Twitter and other forms of social media generally as "a pain."</p>
<p>"People have these conversational tones on Twitter," said Jeremiah Owyang, a web strategist and partner at the Altimeter Group. "The downside is, people forget that there's a publishing aspect."</p>
<p>Many network officials see the risk but still sing the praises of social media as marketing and PR tools, at least for now.</p>
<p>"As a PR professional, I totally believe the pros outweigh the cons," CBS media-relations chief Chris Ender said of Twitter. "It creates a deeper connection with your audience. And the audience is so fragmented that you need to use multiple forms of communication."</p>
<p>When Paul McCartney was a guest on David Letterman's show over the summer, fans began tweeting as his band set up for a rooftop performance.</p>
<p>The flurry of reports built buzz for that night's show and helped ratings, Ender said.</p>

<p>Let's not be naive; all governing parties devote themselves not just to running government but also hanging on to power.</p>
<p>Opposition Liberals are insisting the Harper government has been putting far too much effort into the latter task.</p>
<p>The Grits are condemning everything from patronage-style political appointments to the use of public monies for advertising they say is partisan in nature.</p>
<p>Their objections once again are placing a spotlight on the "hyper-partisanship" that Stephen Harper has been criticized for in the past.</p>
<p>Politicking by governing parties is tricky. It can help them consolidate their base and gain public support but also can be damaging.</p>
<p>Remember the Chretien government's sponsorship scandal, revealing Liberal efforts to gain support in Quebec through</p>
<p>advertising? The project reeked of cronyism and revealed fraudulent practices, ultimately doing in the Liberals.</p>
<p>Harper himself got a taste of the drawbacks of excessive partisanship last December when he proposed eliminating public subsidies for political parties, raising the ire of the opposition which subsequently withdrew support from the minority government. In the end, the PM had to seek a recess of Parliament to save his hide.</p>
<p>The latest controversy surrounding Conservative-style politicking has the Ignatieff Liberals themselves trying to gain political advantage by condemning Conservatives for spending tax dollars not so much with the public good, but themselves, in mind.</p>
<p>Liberals are unlikely to benefit because people remember their team getting up to the same shenanigans.</p>
<p>But among the stuff the Grits are balking at are mock government cheques for public works emblazoned with Conservative logos that irresponsibly leave an impression the party itself is forking over the cash.</p>
<p>Liberals, who report uncovering 47 instances since 2007 when MPs presented at least 181 such personalized, partisan cheques to constituents, are</p>
<p>taking their complaints to the federal ethics commissioner.</p>
<p>They registered another objection earlier this month when public works critic Martha Hall-Finlay complained to Treasury Board about the government's ad campaign promoting its</p>
<p>infrastructure spending plan, although the ads don't in fact cite the Conservative party.</p>
<p>Hall-Finlay said at least $56 million has been spent since January in "a spending spree on taxpayer-paid partisan advertising."</p>
<p>She noted the government, with much less to gain from an ad campaign on the H1N1 virus, has spent only a fraction of that informing Canadians about the possible pandemic.</p>
<p>Additionally, Liberals are complaining about too much of the infrastructure cash going to Conservative ridings.</p>
<p>The Harperites also been strongly partisan in their appointments, with few exceptions naming Conservatives to order-in-council jobs.</p>
<p>They've also relentlessly attacked Michael Ignatieff in advertising, on their website and in constituency mailers in Liberal-held ridings.</p>
<p>Indeed Conservatives are credited with destroying former Liberal leader Stephane Dion's image through similar advertising. Ignatieff recently coined a phrase describing the Conservative modus operandi: "The politics of personal destruction."</p>
<p>What's interesting is that in the face of mounting Liberal complaints about Conservative partisanship, the Harperites' polling numbers have been going up, not down. A poll Friday put Conservatives at 41 per cent, within reach of a majority government.</p>
<p>Which suggests Canadians are more concerned about economic issues than partisanship.</p>
<p>Or, it may be they've grown too used to government partisanship, after witnessing antics of the Mulroney and Chretien regimes.</p>
<p>Voters seem prepared to look the other way unless a government's partisanship involves the passing of envelopes stuffed with cash in restaurants with checkered tablecloths.</p>

</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus is spreading faster in British Columbia than in any other province, with public health officials reporting unprecedented rates of flu for this time of year.</p>
<p>An eighth British Columbian -- Ashley Miller, 26 of Mission -- has died of H1N1-related causes. Her death, on Sunday, is the first one in which the victim had no evident underlying health condition.</p>
<p>Doctors say more deaths can be anticipated.</p>
<p>"With the amount of virus going around, it is going to randomly affect some otherwise healthy people. It's tragic," said Dr. Roland Guasparini, chief medical health officer for the Fraser Health region.</p>
<p>More than 35 per cent of cases of influenza-like illness in B.C. tested positive for H1N1 in early October, while in Ontario, Quebec, and the Prairies, the positive rates hovered around five per cent.</p>
<p>"B.C. is well into its second wave of H1N1," provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall told a news conference Friday at the BC Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>"We have more cases than the rest of Canada," Kendall said.</p>
<p>From Oct. 4 to Oct. 10, British Columbia's provincial labs tested 998 specimens, about 350 of which tested positive for H1N1. Comparatively, during the same week, Ontario's lab identified about 75 positive cases, Quebec identified 21 and Alberta identified 135.</p>
<p>Those numbers do not reflect the absolute number of H1N1 cases in each province, as doctors are not testing every person with flu-like symptoms. But they give an indication of B.C.'s elevated rates of H1N1.</p>
<p>Kendall could not provide an explanation for B.C.'s surge in cases, saying only that it is common for influenza to hit some regions faster than others.</p>
<p>"It's not an untypical pattern for influenza. It moves across the country in different ways and sometimes one province is relatively unaffected while others are affected," Kendall said.</p>
<p>"As to why, somebody has to be first," he said.</p>
<p>Guasparini said it is still "extremely rare" to become seriously ill or die from the virus. Those with previously existing health conditions, such as chronic heart disease, asthma and lung disease, remain among the most susceptible.</p>
<p>"The majority of people are going to get over this after feeling kind of like they've been hit by a truck for a few days," he said.</p>
<p>However, he cautioned that even otherwise healthy people are at risk.</p>
<p>Globally, as many as 30 to 40 per cent of H1N1-related deaths have been among patients with no known underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>Miller's death remained under investigation by health authorities. Fraser Health spokesman Roy Thorpe said interviews with the victim's physician and family were underway to determine whether she had any previously existing health condition. That effort could take several days to complete, he said.</p>
<p>The young Mission mother died Sunday, two days after she was admitted to Abbotsford Regional Hospital.</p>
<p>Kendall said some people with H1N1 can develop complications that cause their lungs to fill up with fluid, making breathing difficult.</p>
<p>A <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page in Miller's memory has been set up with more than 140 friends signing on as of Friday afternoon and dozens of people leaving messages of sympathy to Miller's family, including her one-year-old daughter, Emma.</p>
<p>The Centre for Disease Control said 78 people have been admitted to hospital since April. The H1N1 vaccine is expected to be available to Canadians in early November.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Absence rates up in some rural schools - Health officials refuse to say if flu to blame</b>
</div><div>By Nick Martin   </div>

</p>
<p>Three rural schools reported higher-than-usual absentee rates Friday -- but Manitoba Health is not saying whether there is any sign that H1N1 was involved at any of the schools.</p>
<p>The schools are Ashern Early Years School, a kindergarten to Grade 4 school in Lakeshore School Division, and two schools in Turtle River S.D. -- the K-12 Alonsa School and Grass River School, a Hutterite colony school near Glenella. Superintendents of the two school divisions were not available.</p>
<p>Manitoba Health declined to say whether H1N1 is involved in the absences.</p>
<p>A Health Department official said: "Public health will work with schools to provide recommendations. If there is a reason to provide public information about a health situation in a school, we'll do so -- otherwise it will be addressed by local public health, the school and parents as has been the normal practice."</p>
<p>Ashern Early Years has about 100 students, Alonsa 170, and Grass River 30.</p>
<p>Education Minister Peter Bjornson told school divisions earlier this week to post daily reports on their websites listing each school as either reporting no unusual absenteeism or higher than usual absenteeism.</p>
<p>Bjornson cautioned that having above-normal absenteeism does not necessarily mean that there is H1N1 in that school, nor did he define higher than usual.</p>
<p>So far, about 80 per cent of the province's school divisions are listing their absence rates, though only Pembina Trails, St. James-Assiniboia and Seine River have done so in Winnipeg. Louis Riel School Division says it will start posting absences Monday, River East Transcona on Tuesday, and Winnipeg S.D. soon.</p>
<p>How Manitoba school divisions are reporting each school's daily absences is quite literally all over the map.</p>
<p>Some list all the schools and their absentee status in an easy-to-read graph on the home page, such as Morden-based Western, Stonewall-area Interlake, and Flin Flon.</p>
<p>Mountain View in Dauphin does not list schools, but reports on its home page that no school has unusual levels of absence.</p>
<p>Many divisions have a link to a similar graph of all schools, such as Pembina Trails, Pine Creek in Gladstone, Mystery Lake in Thompson, and Garden Valley in Winkler.</p>
<p>Some divisions require parents to go deeper into the website to call up the websites of individual schools, such as Neepawa-area Beautiful Plains, Fort la Bosse in the Virden region, and Rolling River in Minnedosa.</p>
<p>Some schools in Rolling River and Altona-area Border Land S.D. were still listing Wednesday's absentee reports early Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Seine River had a link to a list of schools, but the city-rural division had added a third category of schools with below-normal absences.</p>
<p>Southwest Horizon in the Souris area did not appear to have a home page pointer, and not all Southwest Horizon schools were reporting absences on their websites.</p>
<p>Kelsey S.D. in The Pas was one of several whose list required parents to download a file, which proved difficult to open.</p>
<p>Brandon, Seven Oaks, Whiteshell, Prairie Rose and Red River Valley appeared to have no absentee reports on their websites Friday.</p>

<p>I once had a magic sweater coat. I got it in a clothing swap from an art director. It was bright green and hung to the floor, a tragic acrylic blend. The belt was lost and the armpits pilled, but it was warm and soft and smelled like fresh baked bread. Putting it on was like wearing a security blanket. I worked in it every day for two years until my boyfriend made me throw it out.</p>
<p>The relationship didn't last.</p>
<p>As anyone who has been irrationally attached to pair of disintegrating jeans or battered trainers knows, clothing can offer much more than just protection from the elements and a public projection of taste. Now that the Thanksgiving damage is done and winter is approaching, we are gravitating back to clothing that makes us feel safe. Certain garments actually become our friends and family, offering us a sense of stability, security and home. I call these comfort clothes – the sartorial equivalent of mac 'n' cheese with bacon.</p>
<p>“The first thing I do when I go home is get into my grubby old sweats,” Susie Sheffman, fashion director of Fashion magazine in Toronto, admitted to me on the phone recently. “For me, it's a metaphor for stripping off the day. It makes me feel secure.”</p>
<p>And in these turbulent times, some garments are offering a whole new level of safety. Last week, Japan's Haruyama Trading introduced a suit designed to protect against the H1N1 virus (retail price: $590). The magic suit is coated with titanium dioxide, a compound usually found in toothpaste. According to the designer, the chemical coating sets off a photocatalyst, zapping the deadly virus when light hits the material's fibres. Researchers have been testing the compound as an effective disinfectant as far back as the SARS outbreak in 2003. A novelty? Perhaps. But the Japanese businessmen who lined up to the get the first run in Tokyo might argue that it's a small price to pay for peace of mind.</p>
<p>While some stiletto-loving label slaves might pooh-pooh the idea of comfort clothes, the concept was in fact responsible for revolutionizing the way women dress. This month saw the release of Coco Avant Chanel, a film about the early life and loves of the mother of modern fashion, played to moody Gallic perfection by Audrey Tautou. Brought up in a world of corsets and fluffy hats, the young Coco dispenses with convention, wearing plain simple garments in an effort to feel natural.</p>
<p>“Don't you want to feel comfortable?” she asks her very first client. Chicness is an afterthought. “I gave women a sense of freedom,” Chanel told Harpers Bazaar in 1923. “I gave them back their bodies: bodies that were drenched in sweat, due to fashion's finery, lace, corsets, underclothes, padding.”</p>
<p>Just as Chanel rose to prominence in the twenties and thirties, a time of political and economic uncertainty, so too are comfort clothes in demand today.</p>
<p>“The recession has created a demand for them,” Bronwyn Cosgrave, a Canadian-born, London-based fashion historian, said in an interview this week. “People want clothes that are relaxed, low-key and anonymously chic. Just look at the craze for cardigans – both Daniel Craig sporting them by Tom Ford in the Bond movies and Michelle Obama everywhere else.”</p>
<p>Cosgrave's own comfort clothes are classics “by or inspired by Chanel.” She also loves her mother's old mink coats. “I have two – a black long one and a short jacket. They are like bathrobes, but even better. And they work from dusk till dawn.”</p>
<p>In times of stress (usually involving deadlines), I have been known to wear the same outfit for days at time. My comfort uniform is somewhere between a mink coat and a bathrobe; more important, it's durable. This is one of the benefits of working at home. No one thinks you're having an affair if you turn up at your desk in the same pair of jeans and black jersey top for three days running.</p>
<p>When times are tough, I'm also more likely to subsist on a diet of toasted cheese sandwiches. Who wants to follow a recipe when there are butterflies in your stomach and a buzzing in your head?</p>
<p>But, according to new research, I might be unusual in this regard. A study published in the Journal of Consumer Research found that people are actually more likely – not less – to try unfamiliar foods in times of stress. Yes, you heard that right. Apparently stress can make us more adventurous when it comes to food choices. There's no comparable research available for fashion, but I'd wager the consumer trend doesn't extend to clothes.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but as the temperature drops and days grow shorter, I'm reaching for my old favourites. I even found a new magic sweater coat. It's ragged and stained. It doesn't repel swine flu, but somehow it still makes me feel safe.</p>

<p>After weeks of listening to parishioners sniffle in the pews, and worrying about the spread of the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend decided its flock needed to make some sacrifices.</p>
<p>This week, priests will be locking up their Communion chalices and, as a precaution against the spread of germs, temporarily stopping the practice of offering wine during Mass.</p>
<p>"When you have 4,500 people showing up for Mass, and you have eight cups for the populace, it's easy to see how this could become a problem -- fast," said the Rev. John Kuzmich of St. Vincent de Paul in Fort Wayne, whose church in northeastern Indiana has about 10,000 members.</p>
<p>As flu season gets under way and fears mount over reports of a rising death toll from H1N1, commonly known as swine flu, many U.S. congregations are taking precautions and adjusting their rituals. "It's the prudent thing to do," said the Rev. Marcos Gonzalez of St. John Chrysostom Catholic Church in Inglewood, Calif., which also plans to offer parishioners the Eucharistic host but no wine in coming weeks. Stanford University's Memorial Church in Palo Alto, Calif., is asking people attending its services to dip the Communion bread into the wine, while Grace Episcopal Cathedral in Topeka, Kan., has taken a more unusual step: wiping its chalices with vodka-soaked gauze after each parishioner takes a sip.</p>
<p>"Obviously, if you are wiping with 80-proof alcohol, you are probably being about as safe as you can be," said the Very Rev. Steve Lipscomb, the cathedral's dean. "Germs don't like . . . a high volume of alcohol."</p>
<p>Other congregations have different solutions. Members of the United Church of Christ in Garden City, N.Y., have been asked to raise their hands -- instead of shaking them -- when greeting one another during services.</p>
<p>In Muncie, Ind., volunteers at Union Chapel Ministries are pulling on protective gloves each Sunday before they pick up the collection plate. Federal and state health officials say these are small but necessary changes to limit the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that swine flu was widespread in 37 states, up from 27 states a week earlier. By Tuesday, 81 children had succumbed to complications of swine flu this year. In response, the federal Department of Health and Human Services, along with the White House Office for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, released a guide that encouraged faith leaders to urge followers to avoid crowds, wash their hands and use hand sanitizer. Some religious leaders, while preaching the virtues of hand-washing and proper hygiene, are cautioning against hysteria.</p>
<p>Bel Air Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles has distributed large bottles of hand sanitizer around its sprawling hilltop campus. Beyond that, church leaders are advising parishioners to use common sense.</p>
<p>"We have a saying around here, 'prudent faith,'" executive director Glenn Reph said of the church that once counted former President Ronald Reagan among its members. "That's the balancing act between faith and reason."</p>
<p>When the leaders of the First Baptist Church of Blackshear, Ga., told their 1,300 members that, because of the flu, they would share smiles instead of handshakes during the service, some parishioners grumbled. Then, they got creative. People stood in the aisles and waved. Others danced, bumped fists or knocked elbows.</p>
<p>"The only thing I told them was, please, no hip bumping," said the Rev. Bill Young, 59. "They know it's temporary. But the need for human connection is real, and no flu can stop it."</p>

<p>The Notre Dame Hounds' collegiate athletic season is on hold on account of the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>All the Hounds' athletic competitions -- including Friday's scheduled Regina Intercollegiate Football League game against the Luther Lions -- have been cancelled or postponed until at least the middle of next week.</p>
<p>Officials at Athol Murray College of Notre Dame made the decision in consultation with the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region and the school's medical personnel.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, there have been five confirmed cases of H1N1 within the student body at the Wilcox-based residential school. Those five students have recuperated following a seven-day quarantine, but caution is being exercised because a few of their classmates have flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"We're interested in the health of our kids and other kids," Rob Palmarin, Notre Dame's president said Friday. "We're not in panic mode. We're in precautionary mode."</p>
<p>Palmarin added that, as of Friday, 14 of Notre Dame's 320 students were being treated by Notre Dame's health-care nurses. A majority of those patients were experiencing flu-like symptoms.</p>

<p>Sure, it can be glamorous being a Chris Rock or Jon Stewart, but for most unknown comedians, the standup lifestyle means driving long hours between towns and sometimes sleeping the night in their car -- if they have a car. It doesn't exactly rock the glam-o-meter.</p>
<p>Live at Gotham, now in its fourth year, features up-and-coming standup comedians trying to work the room at New York's Gotham Comedy Club. It's different from the traditional TV standup special in that most of these comics are comedians you've never heard of. Like ogling So You Think You Can Dance and American Idol, it can be fun to spot a potential star-in-the-making before they break out.</p>
<p>Daily Show contributor and Flight of the Conchords regular Kristen Schaal was one of 35 relative unknowns to take the stage for Live at Gotham's inaugural show in 2006. Andy Borowitz, creator of the satirical website the Borowitz Report and winner of the first National Press Club award for humour, was also on the dais that night.</p>
<p>Subsequent Live at Gotham unknowns over the years have included Toronto's Gerry Dee -- Dee's day job at the time was phys-ed teacher and hockey coach at Toronto's De La Salle College -- and Calgary's Ryan Belleville, the youngest comedian to have his own Comedy Now! special for CTV.</p>
<p>Improv comedian and former Canadian Idol sidekick Jon Dore appeared on last year's Live at Gotham, among some 50 other hopefuls.</p>
<p>Tonight's show was taped in August, with hosts Jim Jefferies, Jo Koy, 30 Rock's Judah Friedlander and the great -- for Daily Show fans, anyway -- Rob Riggle, the former U.S. Marine who once famously demonstrated the "AC 360" on CNN news anchor Anderson Cooper.</p>
<p>(For those who missed it, Riggle grabbed Anderson unexpectedly outside Anderson's makeup trailer during last November's presidential campaign, lifted him off the ground and spun him in a 360-degree circle while shouting, "This is what we call the AC 360!")</p>
<p>There's method to Live at Gotham's madness. The show is sponsored in part by the U.S. cable channel Comedy Central and, indirectly, Canada's own Comedy Network. Comedy Central policy is that a comedian must perform on Live at Gotham before being considered for a Comedy Central Presents one-person special. Think of it as the AHL or Major Junior Hockey League of the big-time comedy leagues. A lot of these comedians will never make it on the big stage, but you never know if you might spot the next Chris Rock or Jon Stewart. That's the fun in watching. That, and some funny punchlines along the way. (Comedy Network, 11 p.m.)</p>
<p>THREE TO SEE</p>
<p>- Pity poor Butters. South Park's favourite whipping boy -- discounting Kenny, that is -- has made it all the way to fourth grade without ever kissing a girl. Tonight, he aims to make up for that, with predictably freaky results. (Comedy Network, 9:30 p.m.)</p>
<p>- Gerard Butler hosts Saturday Night Live, with musical guest Shakira. And if you can name the last movie Butler was in, good for you! (Global, NBC, 11:30 p.m.)</p>
<p>- In case you missed the Teen Choice Awards the first time -- and if you did, shame on you! -- here's your chance to catch it on the rebound. Miley, Sean Kingston, Black Eyed Peas and the Jonas Brothers perform. And if you don't know who won what, we're not going to spoil the surprise here. Not that it was much of a surprise but, like, well, you know. Whatever. (MuchMusic, 9 p.m.)</p>
<p>SUNDAY</p>
<p>Halloween has come early. The Simpsons' annual tradition, Treehouse of Horror, now in its 20th incarnation, airs tonight -- thanks to a little game called baseball and a not-so-little tradition called the World Series.</p>
<p>Baseball, you see, is going to take over The Simpsons' parent network for the next couple of weekends -- barring rainouts, H1N1 flu outbreaks, general public hysteria or the End of Days.</p>
<p>Fox's only alternative was to wait until, like, after Halloween, which is getting so old. Nothing says yesterday's leftover candy quite like celebrating Halloween days after the fact. And so, tonight, Homer, Marge and the gang scare up three new spine-tingling tales of the strange, spooky and intermittently funny kind.</p>
<p>Treehouse of Horror XX's trio of supernatural tales kicks off with Dial M for Murder, or Press #, in which Bart offers Lisa a Hitchcockian deal: Play a prank on Mrs. Krabappel and he will take care of "a little problem" for her. Faster than you can say "strangers on a train," Lisa finds herself in an animated homage -- in beautiful black-and-white! -- to such Hitchcock classics as Vertigo, Psycho, North by Northwest and Spellbound.</p>
<p>Simpsons fans too young to remember Psycho -- either the Hitchcock original or the lame Vince Vaughn remake -- may prefer Treehouse of Horror's second tale, the self-explanatory 28 Days Later, in which Krusty the Clown serves up burgers made out of cows that were fed other cows, causing the gentle folks of Springfield to turn into lurching, munching zombies -- not unlike the way I felt after forcing myself to sit through a recent Grey's Anatomy marathon.</p>
<p>The final tale, There's No Business Like Moe Business, finds Springfield's most famous tavern owner taking Sweeney Todd a little too seriously for his, and his patrons' own good, with predictably moody results.</p>
<p>Moe's singing voice could use a little work, but then Marge doesn't exactly sound like Sarah Brightman, either.</p>
<p>All that, and Frankenstein, Dracula and The Mummy parodies, too. You may laugh or you may not, but chances are, you've never seen Homer cross-eyed before. Pass the Halloween candy. (Global, Fox, 8 p.m.)</p>

<p>PANDEMIC BUSINESS PLANNING SEMINAR</p>
<p>When: Today, registration at 8:30 a.m., seminar from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m.</p>
<p>Where: Hilton Garden Inn, 90 22nd St. East</p>
<p>Cost: Free</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Businesses should plan for the worst and hope for the best when it comes to the threat of a pandemic illness this flu season, according to the International Centre for Infectious Disease (ICID).</p>
<p>Although companies can't outright prevent their employees from getting sick, a pandemic business plan can help businesses -- especially those that are small- and medium-sized -- deal with the effects of a widespread illness that could result in absenteeism rates higher than 25 per cent, said Wendy Schettler, program director with ICID.</p>
<p>"Everybody should have this pandemic plan," Schettler said from her Winnipeg office. "Even if it turns out this pandemic is not as severe as people are planning for and you don't really need it, you'll need it another time.</p>
<p>"You plan for the worst and hope for the best, and if you don't need it this time, have a big sigh of relief, file it and take it out when you do need it."</p>
<p>The ICID is partnering with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce to present free pandemic planning seminars across the country this fall. As the threat of the H1N1 virus continues to grow, Schettler said business owners and company management need to plan for the potential fallout from an illness that the majority of the population doesn't have a natural immunity against.</p>
<p>"We see this as a priority and certainly so does the chamber of commerce," she said. "Really (we want) to try and mitigate the economic impact that a pandemic outbreak can have, particularly on small- and medium-sized businesses. . . . We want to provide as much information and resources to them as possible to make that planning easier."</p>
<p>The seminar is split into two main focuses, Schettler explained. The first has participants thinking about putting together a plan and assessing how their workplace could be affected by a pandemic, which includes changes in demand for service and a drop in staff levels.</p>
<p>"They have to imagine what it would be like if they had 10 or 15 per cent of their staff off, or 25 per cent or 35 per cent," she said. "How could that impact on their ability to deliver what they deliver, whether it's a product or a service?"</p>
<p>STAY HOME FOR ONCE</p>
<p>The second focus of the seminar is on the human resources side of dealing with a pandemic. An HR specialist is on hand at the event to discuss topics such as sick pay, working while ill and creating a healthy work environment, Schettler said.</p>
<p>"Many organizations really frown on people being home sick and they are actually encouraged to come to work when they're sick," she said. "So how do you change that culture where people need their salaries but, at the same time, when they come to work they are also potentially a danger to the other people in that workplace?"</p>
<p>Even if companies haven't had any problems with day-to-day operations early this flu season, it doesn't mean the business is immune from the consequences of a pandemic later this year. The H1N1 threat, said Schettler, is expected to extend through the better part of the next six months.</p>
<p>"When you're looking at H1N1, you're looking all the way into the spring, you're looking April," she said.</p>
<p>The ICDC and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce have set up a website with pandemic planning tools at businessfluplan.ca for people unable to attend today's seminar in Saskatoon.</p>

</p>
<p>In an attempt to quell rumours and calm fears, the Horizon School Division confirmed a Wynyard Composite High School student, who had contracted the H1N1 virus, died last week.</p>
<p>The school division issued a news release stating that although the youth tested positive for H1N1, Saskatoon Health Region officials have not conclusively determined that the death occurred due to complications from the illness.</p>
<p>"We would like to express our deepest sympathies to the family," said Horizon School Division communications manager Ken Sogge.</p>
<p>School division administrators, who only learned of the situation a couple of days ago, brought in grief counsellors to assist staff and classmates at the school.</p>
<p>The teenage boy, who died Oct. 8, was the second student within the school division to test positive for the virus. On Oct. 5, the Horizon School Division advised the public that one of its students had tested positive for the</p>
<p>virus; however, that school was never identified.</p>
<p>"The case of H1N1 reported from Wynyard is an isolated case and there are no additional illnesses reported at this time," Sogge said.</p>
<p>While provincial health and school division officials have not released the 16-year-old boy's name, a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> memorial wall has been created honouring the teen. Postings on the site are speculating on the cause of death -- one links it to H1N1; another said he was stricken by severe pneumonia.</p>
<p>"We put out the news release because we anticipated people were going to be asking questions and there were some decisions that needed to be made. So we tried to get ahead of the game," Sogge said.</p>
<p>"There was a large provincial cross-country racing event with 600-plus students scheduled to arrive in Wynyard this weekend. It was therefore necessary to gather information as quickly as possible in order to make informed decisions regarding the event."</p>
<p>After consulting with the Saskatoon Health Region and the Saskatchewan High School Athletics Association, it was decided as a precautionary measure to cancel the meet and a number of local events.</p>
<p>Sogge said schools will remain open, continue to follow the division's pandemic influenza plan and work with the health regions in the area.</p>
<p>Parents who have concerns about their children attending school should seek advice from their family doctor, he added.</p>

<p>The death of a student at Wynyard Composite High School has led to the relocation of the Saskatchewan High Schools Athletic Association cross-country championships.</p>
<p>The event was to be held Saturday in Wynyard, but those plans changed after it was confirmed that a 16-year-old student at the Wynyard school had died Oct. 8 after contracting the H1N1 virus. The host venue will now be the area surrounding Regina's Canada Games Athletics Complex, also known as Douglas Park.</p>
<p>SHSAA executive director Kevin Vollet placed a call Wednesday to Regina High Schools Athletic Association commissioner Greg Johnson and asked if his district would be interested in staging the provincial meet on short notice. Johnson quickly consented and began making plans, which were finalized Thursday. The abundance of hotel space in Regina factored into the SHSAA's decision to move the event to the Queen City.</p>
<p>Johnson received clearance from Wascana Centre Authority to utilize the venue, and also received permission from the City of Regina for a street closure near the complex. During the event, the Douglas Park area will be accessible only via Park Street.</p>
<p>The provincial meet is to begin Saturday at 1 p.m., and is likely to conclude by 3 p.m. Registration is to take place from 10 to 11 a.m.</p>

<p>Three Regina Intercollegiate Football League games were played Thursday night on Taylor Field.</p>
<p>In Schwann Conference action, the Campbell Tartans outlasted the Balfour Redmen 9-8. Earlier, the O'Neill Titans defeated the Martin Monarchs 26-8 and, in another Stewart Conference game, the Miller Marauders beat the Johnson Wildcats 47-14.</p>
<p>The Schwann Conference game went down to the wire. Balfour quarterback Zach Oleynik scored on a three-yard run with 57 seconds left in the fourth quarter to narrow the deficit to one point, but the ensuing convert attempt was blocked by Campbell's Geoff Hughes. Oleynik's TD was set up by his 50-yard bomb to Ringo Gelsinger.</p>
<p>Campbell's touchdown came on a 28-yard pass from Frankie Gray to Brady Keller.</p>
<p>The Tartans' victory created a logjam atop the conference. The Winston Knoll Wolverines and LeBoldus Golden Suns have 4-1 records. Balfour and Campbell are tied at 4-2, followed by the Riffel Royals (3-2).</p>
<p>Winston Knoll is to play the Sheldon-Williams Spartans today (5:15, Mosaic Stadium). Riffel and LeBoldus are to square off tonight, 7:30, at the University of Regina.</p>
<p>To begin the tripleheader, Miller registered its first victory of the season on the strength of two touchdown passes and two TD runs by Allan Carnegie.</p>
<p>Carnegie rushed for seven- and one-yard touchdowns. He also threw TD passes of 23 yards (to Tyler Pastuch) and 30 yards (to Zac Lang). The Marauders also got TD runs from Pastuch (23 yards), Nick Leont (seven yards) and Mike Desjarlais (one yard). Lang added a fumble recovery and an interception.</p>
<p>Wildcats quarterback Daniel Selke threw TD passes of 89 yards (to Darren Goetz) and 28 yards (to Colton Lee).</p>
<p>In the next game, O'Neill improved its record to 6-1 while defeating Martin.</p>

<p>Forget the huge white ambulance. Forget the lights and sirens. Forget the long wait to be handed off to an emergency-room doctor.</p>
<p>Winnipeg paramedics could soon arrive at your door in a much homelier vehicle: a Ford Focus. If the provincial government approves the idea, a paramedic could be sent by car to triage and treat some of the thousands of non-life-threatening cases called in to 9-1-1 every year.</p>
<p>The move is part of a bold new plan meant to reduce pressure on city emergency rooms, ease the chronic shortage of paramedics, and cope better with the looming H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>One paramedic could be on the streets in a Ford Focus in a few weeks, with five paramedics cruising the city in sedans by the time the worst of the pandemic hits, said Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service (WFPS) Deputy Chief Ken Sim.</p>
<p>The city would still send a full-scale ambulance to critical cases, such as heart attacks or car accidents. Those are only about 10 per cent of the cases medics attend to.</p>
<p>The new "community paramedics" would act more like nurses who make house calls, responding to a whole host of less serious cases that don't need a $1-million ambulance, two highly trained medics and an automatic trip to the nearest emergency room. That includes everything from worrisome flu to sprained ankles, diabetes and seizures.</p>
<p>The community medics would come equipped with most of the same gear as advanced-care paramedic carries, such as medications and intravenous supplies.</p>
<p>However, they would use a slightly more sophisticated triage checklist similar to the one nurses use in the emergency rooms. Based on that list, the medics could treat someone on the spot, call a taxi or a stretcher service to transport someone to a clinic, or strap the patient into the Ford's passenger seat and provide a lift to an urgent-care clinic or even the ER. "We'd be able to get a trained paramedic to people sooner than having to wait for a two-person ambulance," Sim said.</p>
<p>Right now, patients with non-life-threatening problems can wait hours for an ambulance to arrive, in part because call volumes have increased nearly 15 per cent in the last five years. Call volumes, plus delays off-loading patients in crowded emergency rooms, have taxed Winnipeg's paramedic service almost to the limit in recent years.</p>
<p>The WFPS is waiting for Health Minister Theresa Oswald to give the pilot project her approval.</p>
<p>Provincial regulations say patients can only be transported by ambulance, so the city needs a ministerial order allowing medics to give patients a lift in the Ford.</p>
<p>The province says it's reviewing the proposal and hopes to have an answer for the WFPS in two weeks.</p>

</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq held this community up Thursday as an example of pandemic preparedness, saying the flu plan developed on the First Nation is a model from which others can learn.</p>
<p>"Some of the things that are happening in this community can be used in other parts of the country," the federal minister said.</p>
<p>"Of course no one model fits all, which is why it's important to travel and learn what is happening across the country and share some of those success stories so that people can learn from that."</p>
<p>The federal government has experienced a few missteps with some First Nations communities since the first outbreak of H1N1 influenza, receiving criticism last month with the delivery of body bags to some Manitoba communities. But Aglukkaq's tour of Cowessess First Nation, about 150 kilometres east of Regina, centred on highlighting the positive. Her visit included a stop at the community's daycare, where three youngsters demonstrated how they can wash their hands while singing the "ABC" song. They also showed off fake sneezes and coughs to illustrate the proper way to cover their mouth -- with their sleeve rather than their hands.</p>
<p>"We try to make it fun for them," said preschool educator Stacy Anaquod, explaining the centre is focused on using hygiene to prevent potential illness from spreading.</p>
<p>The band is also in the process of sending out a flu information kit to residents that includes a package of coloured flags, which residents could hang outside their homes to communicate if necessary. Each colour has a different meaning, with white indicating everyone inside the home is OK and red indicating someone is ill.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq credited the community with starting to develop plans a few years ago to deal with a possible pandemic, before anyone had even heard of H1N1. Health Canada states that 96 per cent of First Nations communities now have pandemic plans.</p>
<p>Plans will differ depending on a community's needs, but the widespread participation of local residents and collaboration with other levels of government has been key to the success at Cowessess, Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>"The entire community is getting out there teaching their population what they can do to prevent the spread of H1N1 and the second phase of that will be to give the community the H1N1 vaccine," she said.</p>
<p>Cowessess Chief Gordon Lerat said the band did a mock one-day immunization project to ensure when the vaccination arrives it can be smoothly administered. Community leaders want everyone to receive it. Lerat said the community's next step will be to work with nearby towns and hospitals to see how they should interact if a serious outbreak develops.</p>
<p>Cowessess, which has more than 600 members living on-reserve, hasn't recorded any H1N1 cases so far.</p>
<p>"I suppose it's our good healthy fresh air and environment around us and being ahead of things when it comes to being hygienic, the direction from our H1N1 committee that has fed out that information to our community, and we think that's helped us a lot," Lerat said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Symptoms don't keep Quebecers at home; 'Alarming' poll; New provincial guide urges us to call in sick</b>

</p>
<p>On the day Quebec unveiled its strategy to combat swine flu through a new publicity campaign, a report suggests the province's workers are ignoring existing guidelines and showing up at work sick.</p>
<p>The Quebec health department is spending $1.4 million to blitz every household with a self-help guide - what you need to know and do to protect your health and the health of others.</p>
<p>Studies tracking the illness have shown that contagiousness is highest during the first four days after symptoms appear, and that a person can infect others at least 24 hours before any sign of illness and up to seven days after.</p>
<p>Here's what the guide says to do about the mildest of symptoms, including a runny nose, sore throat, a cough but no fever: "Decision. Probably a cold. Rest at home."</p>
<p>But in a CROP survey of its members, the provincial professional order of human resources personnel found that most employees tend to ignore their aches and pains.</p>
<p>Sick or not, they are going to work, said Florent Francoeur, head of the Quebec Human Resources Association.</p>
<p>According to the report, 60 per cent of us would show up to work if we aren't feeling well.</p>
<p>And when it comes to H1N1, nearly 25 per cent said they would go in to the office even if they or a household member caught the virus.</p>
<p>The laissez-faire attitude was even more prevalent among men, spiking to 33 per cent, or one in three, reporting that they still intended to go to work if they or someone at home caught the virus.</p>
<p>Yet 44 per cent said they would be afraid to go to work if one of their co-workers had swine flu.</p>
<p>And despite the pandemic threat, 53 per cent of respondents said they haven't changed their personal habits - washing their hands more frequently, coughing into their elbows or using a hand sanitizer. Among men, this percentage jumped to 58.</p>
<p>"We were surprised by these disturbing results," Francoeur said.</p>
<p>"What's alarming is that people are not taking precautions.</p>
<p>"We don't want to create a climate of panic, but we want to alert employers they should have an emergency plan."</p>
<p>The poll shows that prevention has a long way to go in Quebec, he said, and that workers and employers each have a role to play.</p>
<p>Horacio Arruda, director of the protection branch of the Quebec Public Health Department, said a poll is like taking a temperature at a specific moment. "I am concerned, but in a crisis those numbers can change very fast - and in a good way. Some guidelines are applied only when people are in a crisis situation."</p>
<p>As for sick people dragging themselves into work, Arruda said, most people who have swine flu would not be able to get out of bed.</p>
<p>As the second wave of H1N1 flu approaches, Quebecers will be better prepared thanks to the provincial 16-page self-help guide, Arruda said.</p>
<p>Most of the data in the guide have already been diffused in media reports, but people tend to forget what to do, he said.</p>
<p>"It's the middle of night, do I have to go to ER or not?"</p>
<p>Arruda said the publicity campaign will be assessed later, as it is considered crucial to inform people ahead of a successful mass vaccination program. "As we get (the H1N1 vaccine), we will give it. But the population has to be at the rendezvous, and they have all the information they need for an informed consent."</p>
<p>For the provincial guide, go to www.pandemiequebec[http://www.pandemiequebec]. gouv.qc.ca/en</p>
<p>CROP surveyed 1,000 people in September; the margin of error is 1.9 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. For survey results, in French only, go to www.portailrh[http://www.portailrh]. org/presse</p>

</p>
<p>Patrick Chan has withdrawn from the Grand Prix figure skating event in Russia this month because of a tear in his left calf.</p>
<p>Chan, 18, still hopes to start his Olympic season at the HomeSense Skate Canada International in Kitchener, Ont., next month. But the disclosure of the muscle tear is the third shocker for Canada's Olympic medal hopes in a week.</p>
<p>Freestyle skier Deidra Dionne, a 2002 Olympic aerials bronze medalist, was forced into retirement by a brain tumour and Stéphanie St-Pierre, a moguls bronze medalist at the 2003 world championship, has called off her season because of a nagging knee injury.</p>
<p>“After consultation with his doctors and coach … it was the right decision to withdraw from this event at this point in the year,” Skate Canada high performance director Mike Slipchuk said. “It's important for Patrick to get back to 100 per cent in preparation for the season ahead, which includes the upcoming 2010 Olympic Winter Games.”</p>
<p>Chan, who won silver at this year's world championships, said he first noticed the pain over the summer while training in Florida. The 18-year-old returned to his native Toronto this week to have the injury examined and was alarmed when his doctor told him he had a torn muscle.</p>
<p>“Absolutely shocked,” Chan said on a conference call yesterday. “I was staring at the screen, I couldn't believe it. Luckily it was very small and it was nothing too, too serious. I just kind of had that moment of, oh my gosh, and I was kind of speechless.</p>
<p>“But quickly I thought about it and I said you know what, this is just another speed bump that I have to experience and I'll move on from it. It's not a life or death situation.”</p>
<p>Chan thinks the calf injury might have been caused by a decrease in weight and muscle mass from antibiotics he was taking after experiencing flu-like symptoms earlier in the summer.</p>
<p>He added he was also concerned about the possibility he had contracted the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu. But after taking it easy and getting some rest, he got better and resumed training in Florida.</p>
<p>“I was so hard-headed that I still thought I could do certain jumps that I shouldn't have,” Chan said. “I pushed my body too hard when I should have just waited for it to heal.”</p>
<p>The <span class="companylink">Rostelecom</span> Cup in Moscow next week is the second stop on the Grand Prix circuit. The first is the Trophée <span class="companylink">Eric Bompard</span> in Paris this week.</p>
<p>Chan said he was disappointed about missing the Russian event and the chance to compete against Evgeni Plushenko, the Turin 2006 gold medalist who's returning to competition.</p>
<p>“It was a huge excitement for me to hear him come back and have the chance to compete against someone who I used to watch on TV at home,” Chan said. “Together with my dad and my mom we used to watch him skate, watch the stories about him and how he got to the point where he is. I'm very disappointed. But I'm pretty sure if he does what he does I'll see him later in the season.”</p>
<p>Skate Canada, which begins Nov. 19, is the sixth and final Grand Prix competition. Regardless of how he performs in Kitchener, Chan won't be eligible for the Grand Prix final in Japan in December because he won't have competed in at least two events.</p>
<p>Chan was a rising star in men's figure skating last season. In addition to capturing Canada's national championship, he won three international events: Skate Canada, Four Continents, and the Bompard.</p>
<p>This weekend, two more of Canada's top medal hopes for Vancouver 2010 are on ice at the Bompard in France – Canadian champion ice dancers Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, and the world bronze-medal pairs team of Jessica Dubé and Bryce Davison.</p>

<p>Q: I experienced a romantic obsession with someone else during my marriage years ago. I think it's important to point out to people that these feelings often come during a lull in your committed relationship, when someone you might be attracted to comes into your life (often work-related).</p>
<p>My solution was to talk to my husband. All I did was confide in him in a calm, quiet moment that I was worried that I had feelings for someone. His response couldn't have been better: "I don't think you can work so closely with someone, especially someone who was such a great mentor to you, without loving them a bit."</p>
<p>That was all I needed to hear and it was the last I thought of that man in a romantic way. People are often sharing their concerns or feelings with a friend or family member instead of with the one they should be - their spouse! I don't talk to my friends or mother or sister about any problems I might have in my marriage . . . the only person I discuss it with is my husband!</p>
<p>A: Lucky you to have such an understanding partner. He's lucky, too, that you trusted him with the information and believed you could deal with it together. The workplace is a common breeding ground for crushes and romantic feelings, especially for those whose marriages are already stressed. Recognizing danger signs at work and at home means you first try to save the marriage.</p>
<p>He's lost interest</p>
<p>Q: I've been together with my boyfriend for close to four years and we've always had a good sexual relationship until the last year. He was living overseas for over a year and we had survived the "long distance relationship.</p>
<p>Since then, he's been having performance issues that he initially said was caused by stress. Now he says that he has no sex drive. We've almost come to a complete stop in our sexual relationship. I know that he loves me deeply and everything else in our relationship is great but this is starting to tear us apart.</p>
<p>He thinks I'm putting too much value on this matter. I know that there's no one else in the picture. The more I talk about it the more frustrated I make him.</p>
<p>A: Your boyfriend has to stop brushing this off as a "not big" problem; and you have to handle the discussion as a couple's challenge, rather than something he's experiencing alone.</p>
<p>Love "in every other way" is only satisfying to the partner - you - if you truly feel satisfied. If so, drop the topic, enjoy the intimacy you do have and hopefully he'll look into what's happened to his libido. However, you should both know that the change in his sexual behaviour could have a health-related basis; he should be checked out by his physician. If pronounced clear, sexual counselling would benefit you both.</p>
<p>Lend a hand</p>
<p>Q: My daughter's in kindergarten and I've found many annoying problems with her teachers. I've complained, e.g. they don't have a scheduled bathroom time and my daughter wet herself several times, because she's too embarrassed to ask aloud to "go."</p>
<p>They make a verbal fuss about keeping hands clean, as part of H1N1 flu prevention, but they often run out of hand sanitizer. Aren't I supposed to protect my child?</p>
<p>A: Yes, you have a right and duty to protect your child but your approach can either be off-putting (such as blaming and angry) or helpful (such as organizing parent volunteers). Remember, a roomful of kindergarten kids can be very demanding. Be sure to also compliment the teachers on the progress your child makes.</p>

<p>The Cleveland Cavaliers are waiting to get back swine flu test results on superstar LeBron James who returned to practice Thursday after taking two days off because of a virus.</p>
<p>James is one of a half dozen Cavalier players suffering from flu-like symptoms. Darnell Jackson and Coby Karl have also been tested for H1N1.</p>
<p>James, Jackson and Karl have all tested positive for Influenza A. Andre Barrett and J.J. Hickson are also feeling ill and will not make the team's next road trip to Texas.</p>
<p>The Cavaliers next National Basketball Association game is Friday in San Antonio and James plans on travelling with the team. They also play in Dallas on Saturday.</p>

</p>
<p>When confronted by bad behaviour, federal Conservative insiders arch an indignant eyebrow and harrumph that any questionable activity by them merely replicates earlier Liberal shenanigans.</p>
<p>In the pursuit of unethical equivalency, all smarmy activity done by this government can be justified as having its genesis in previous administrations.</p>
<p>Little wonder the public is so Ottawa-cynical. The changing of the government guard is nothing more than new dogs learning old tricks.</p>
<p>The latest lesson-learned is the plastering of Conservative logos, colours, MP names or prime ministerial signatures on oversized cheques for public presentation purposes.</p>
<p>The real signatory on the bottom line should be our kids. They'll be burdened with repaying all this borrowed payola while simultaneously carr ying creaky baby boomers and hefty-pensioned politicians on their sagging shoulders.</p>
<p>But given that Canada's stimulus program is rapidly morphing into a Conservative campaign strategy, milking maximum recovery credit from lingering recession misery has become a government preoccupation.</p>
<p>Beyond the shameful chequebook politics, there's an apparent tendency to concentrate stimulus funding in government-held ridings. This is hard to avoid in Alberta, but now that it seems to be a national trend, they're starting to argue it's a practice perfected by the old Liberals.</p>
<p>When it comes to claiming glory for public funds, it's true Liberals usually invited only kind or their cronies to announcements.</p>
<p>But the Conservatives have elevated this strategy to an invitational art form. They've banished MPs of different parties from announcements in their ridings and even denied entry to rival-party provincial figures (the recent fiscal report card, for example), the better to have only Tories basking in front row exposure.</p>
<p>Conservatives will argue their overall strategy is no different than the Liberal sponsorship program, which plastered Quebec events with Maple Leaf watermarks to promote federalism at a time when the Liberals were the only competitive federal party in that province.</p>
<p>If you argue "selective stimulus," they come back with "shady sponsorship." Red cheque, blue cheque, one cheque, two cheques, new boss same as the old boss ... OK, you get the idea.</p>
<p>But the partisan handouts are just the latest game played with your tax dollars by a government that promised to do things better and differently.</p>
<p>They've blanketed the airwaves with government-promotion ads at a pace six times the rate of any H1N1 public education blitz--a health message that clearly needs delivering given Prime Minister Stephen Harper's apparent uncertainty Wednesday about the swine flu vaccine's value. But wait, they argue, past Liberals unleashed their own self-promotion blitz in the preelection period, a fact detailed in Harper's master's thesis.</p>
<p>Conservatives also rationalize the rapid stacking of the Senate with Tory toadies as merely echoing what would happen if a future Liberal prime minister filled the vacant seats with his choice of bums.</p>
<p>They load up the judiciary with card-carrying Conservatives to bolster a bench stacked with Liberal appointees.</p>
<p>Those Liberal lobby firms which Harper accused of exerting undue influence on the government have been replaced with a new group of true-blue arm-twisters, granted preferred access to bent cabinet ears in exchange for parroting the government line.</p>
<p>Conservatives are copying the Liberal playbook in keeping politically awkward documents under wraps by throwing a blanket of national security secrecy over embarrassing paper trails.</p>
<p>On and on goes a pattern that, after 1,300-plus days in power, has seen these Conservatives prove that imitation is the sincerest form of Liberal flattery.</p>
<p>The gold standard for this government's definition of acceptable behaviour is now being set by past Liberals.</p>
<p>Federal politics has been reduced to the pursuit of moral and ethical parity as the two governing parties seek a sleazy equilibrium to prepare for the next election.</p>
<p>So far, they're perfectly matched.</p>

</p>
<p>Between a suspected bout of swine flu and a diagnosed torn calf muscle, Patrick Chan has had a beastly time lately.</p>
<p>So bad that the reigning Canadian men's figure skating champ has withdrawn from next week's <span class="companylink">Rostelecom</span> Cup of Russia in Moscow. It also means he will not be able to qualify for the lucrative Grand Prix Final in Tokyo in early December. It follows the six Grand Prix events in Paris, Moscow, Beijing, Nagano, Lake Placid and Kitchener.</p>
<p>But this season is all about the Olympics and Chan will be ready for Vancouver in February. In fact, Skate Canada director of high performance Mike Slipchuk said Chan will probably be 100-per-cent healed in 14 days.</p>
<p>"The recovery is very optimistic," said Slipchuk.</p>
<p>"It's about 60-per-cent healthy," added Chan, who thinks he may have contracted the H1N1 virus on a plane ride from Toronto to Vancouver for the Skate Canada high performance camp several weeks ago. He said the antibiotics used to treat the virus may have made his calf muscle injury worse.</p>
<p>"It took me six weeks to get to the state I was in before I got sick," Chan said Thursday. "I lost a lot of weight. I lost a lot of my muscle power and mass. It brought my muscle strength way down. I was hard-headed, I thought I could do jumps I shouldn't have."</p>
<p>CALF MUSCLE HAS SLIGHT TEAR</p>
<p>He continued to train in Florida, working on a new long program and his old short program, but he felt pain while jumping and knew something was wrong.</p>
<p>"I started getting calf pains. It just slowly got worse and worse. I got them treated, got them looked at. No one really found the real problem with my calf until I came home just recently, on Wednesday."</p>
<p>A doctor in Toronto found a slight calf tear. In consultation with Skate Canada officials and his agent Kevin Albrecht, Chan made the decision to pull out of the Russian competition and get healthy for Skate Canada International in Kitchener in mid-November and nationals in London in mid-January.</p>
<p>It's not like it's really painful, like I can't walk," he said. "I can still skate. We want to catch it early before it gets any worse. Really this season, it's really selfish to say, the Grand Prix aren't of very big importance," said Chan.</p>
<p>But he still doesn't think he would have kept going even if this was not the leadup to the Olympics.</p>
<p>"To be honest, I would have taken the time to get it all better. Sure, I could go and kind of grind it out. I could finish my long program and wind up tearing most of my muscle. It's important to get it 100 per cent so I don't even have to think about it."</p>
<p>Chan said it is the first injury he has suffered while skating and it came as a shock to hear it described as a tear.</p>
<p>"I have to pay my dues I guess. Luckily it was very small. It was nothing too, too severe. I had that moment of oh my gosh, kind of speechless."</p>
<p>LOST TIME CAN BE MADE UP</p>
<p>He doesn't think he will suffer much from losing one of his two Grand Prix assignments and the chance at the Final.</p>
<p>"The only disadvantage is not having the chance to show the program and kind of get a chance to fine-tune the program, especially in competition because everything changes in competition."</p>
<p>Efforts could be made to simulate competition by having Chan skate his programs for a selected panel of judges during practice in Florida or Toronto.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>City prepares for mass vaccinations; Flu program biggest undertaking in health agency's 150-year history, top doctor says</b>
</div><div>Kate Jaimet   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>620 words</div><div>16 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Ottawa's public-health department is preparing to set up seven massive flu-vaccination sites to combat the H1N1 virus, in what the city's top medical officer describes as the biggest undertaking in the agency's 150-year history.</p>
<p>"By the end of October we will be ready to run citywide clinics for a minimum of five weeks, seven days a week," said Dr. Isra Levy in a briefing to city council's community and protective services committee Thursday morning.</p>
<p>"Our expectation ... is that we can perhaps reach 40 per cent of the population, assuming that the vaccine comes in at a time when interest is high."</p>
<p>The vaccination program's start date is not yet set. It depends on when the vaccine is ready, approved by Health Canada, and distributed to public-health agencies.</p>
<p>The seven mass vaccination centres identified by the Ottawa public health agency are:</p>
<p>- Kanata Recreation Centre</p>
<p>- Tom Brown Arena in Mechanicsville</p>
<p>- Richelieu-Vanier Recreation Centre in Vanier</p>
<p>- The City of Ottawa service centre at 255 Centrum Blvd. in Orléans</p>
<p>- The Ottawa Public Health Centre at 100 Constellation Cres. in Nepean</p>
<p>- Walter Baker Sports Centre in Barrhaven</p>
<p>- Fred Barrett arena in Gloucester, alternating weekly with the Jim Durrell Centre in South Ottawa.</p>
<p>There will also be one roving clinic and an outreach team for people who are housebound.</p>
<p>"We're trying to blanket the city as much as we can on a population basis ... We'll be aiming to get into every ward with that roving clinic," Levy said.</p>
<p>Levy said that there will probably be a limited supply of the vaccine in the first week or two, and asked the community to give priority to those considered at high risk: people with chronic medical conditions; pregnant women; children from six months to five years old; health-care workers; and care providers of high-risk people who cannot be immunized.</p>
<p>Levy said the vaccine is the best way to combat the global flu pandemic. But he acknowledged that there will be disruptions to the recreational programs normally held in those recreation centres, and to many programs usually delivered by the public health agency, including programs for school-age children, nutrition programs, special needs programs, physical activities programs, prenatal health classes, outreach to seniors, nutrition programs, and cancer-screening initiatives.</p>
<p>"I can't emphasize enough how painful I find the redeployment of staff from these programs to be ... We know that individuals in our community have their lives altered and changed for the better by these programs," Levy said.</p>
<p>Levy said that certain top-priority public health programs will continue to operate, including: early-years outreach to at-risk families, STD screening, prevention, and treatment; infectious disease programs; the smoke-free Ontario program; and inspections of high-risk restaurants.</p>
<p>Ottawa's director of parks and recreation Aaron Burry said that some programs in the affected arenas and community centres will be moved or cancelled, and he expects to send out notification of the changes within the next two days.</p>
<p>The first wave of the H1N1 virus peaked in Ottawa in June, followed by a quieter period in July and August. Since the beginning of September, there have been 27 confirmed cases of H1N1 in the city. Ten people have been hospitalized and one has died. Most of those hospitalized had underlying medical conditions, and about half were under the age of 25. Most flu cases have been mild, with patients recovering on their own.</p>

<p>It's a warning Patrick Chan has received often in this Olympic season: Be careful. This is the time weird things happen.</p>
<p>Getting laid low by what you suspect was swine flu certainly falls in that category.</p>
<p>The Toronto figure skater believes a case of H1N1 may have led to the leg injury, which knocked him out of next week's Cup of Russia in Moscow. Chan has a muscle tear in his left calf, but is confident it won't hurt preparations for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.</p>
<p>"I've had people telling me who have trained for the Olympics say, 'You know Patrick, be careful this year. Weird things happen. Things that you never thought would happen happen,'" said Chan yesterday.</p>
<p>"I think this is a perfect example. But you know what, this is life. I take it in stride and I'm actually getting lots of positive feedback and positive things out of this and I'll move on. It's a blessing in disguise actually."</p>
<p>It's hard not to see it as a setback, despite Chan's brave words. It means the world championship silver medallist only gets one international competition before the Olympics</p>
<p>next month's HomeSense Skate Canada International in Kitchener. He can't qualify for the Grand Prix Final in December in Tokyo because he'll only be competing in one event.</p>
<p>As Skate Canada boss William Thomson pointed out on a conference call Thursday, the last two world champions didn't compete at the Grand Prix Final.</p>
<p>But at age 19, Chan isn't a battle tested veteran and would have benefited from getting more international feedback on his routines, particularly a new Lori Nichol-choreographed long program to music from Phantom of the Opera.</p>
<p>"The only disadvantage is not having the chance to show the program and kind of get a chance to fine-tune the program, especially in competition, because everything kind of changes in competition. It's never the same from practice," said Chan. Chan said he got a bad case of the flu last month at the Canadian team's high performance camp. He said the symptoms were similar to H1N1 and he was sick for six weeks and lost a lot of weight.</p>
<p>He said the antibiotics he was taking contributed to a loss of muscle mass and he believes that made him more susceptible to the injury, diagnosed as a gastrocnemius tear in his left calf. The injury has affected his training for a month.</p>
<p>"I was still hard-headed and thought I could do certain jumps that I shouldn't have and pushed my body too hard when I should have just waited for it to heal," said Chan, of the first injury of his young career.</p>
<p>"I've never experienced something this bad. It definitely came as a shock, but I have to pay my dues I guess."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Can this minister fix the health file? Job 1 for Deb Matthews is to help the Ontario government regain its health policy focus. Good luck with that</b>
</div><div>Michael Rachlis   </div>
<div>953 words</div><div>16 October 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A25</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>This has been a bad year for the McGuinty government's health file. The eHealth revelations destroyed health minister David Caplan and sidelined Dr. Alan Hudson, the Premier's personal health-policy fixer.</p>
<p>Can Deb Matthews sail to the rescue and help the government regain its health policy focus as the new health minister?</p>
<p>Matthews demonstrated that she could deal with tough issues by shepherding Ontario's initial anti-poverty strategy through the cabinet. But the politics of poverty is a picnic compared with the no-holds barred health portfolio.</p>
<p>Even Conservatives agree that poverty is a bad thing, while scientific arguments rage about whether the vaccine for H1N1 is a good idea, now, in two months, or never.</p>
<p>Ontario's health landscape features the country's most complex policy environment with hundreds of competing centres of power including the country's strongest union, the Ontario Medical Association. Stir this high-tech brew of dedicated caregivers and supercharged egos with 43 per cent of the provincial budget and you have a policy environment that few health ministers have understood and fewer still have mastered.</p>
<p>The conflict over Bill 179 is an example of the problems Matthews now faces.</p>
<p>The bill would give more authority to health professionals, such as nurses and pharmacists, to act independently. The best evidence is that the new acts are within the scope of these health professionals.</p>
<p>But the Ontario Medical Association responded with full-page newspaper ads warning Ontarians that our health is at stake.</p>
<p>Last week, Ontario Hospital Association CEO Tom Closson alleged in the Star that the OMA's opposition to Bill 179 exemplified its pattern of turf protection. Two days later, OMA president Dr. Susan Strasberg responded that the OHA should first help its own constituency, hospital administrators, "break this addiction to service cuts."</p>
<p>When a relatively innocuous piece of legislation triggers a civil war, how do we get an intelligent debate on system integration or physician payment?</p>
<p>There are two components required for the government to move ahead: it needs to develop a more cohesive plan, and it needs a smarter political strategy.</p>
<p>The government put in place 14 Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs) in 2006. The networks receive Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care funds for hospitals, long-term care, home care, mental health and community health centres. The networks are supposed to promote integration and coordination of services but the supporting policies are lacking.</p>
<p>Legislation establishing the health networks requires the ministry to produce a strategic plan that would guide the LHINs in developing their own Integrated Health Services Plans. Despite considerable effort, the ministry has never released its strategic plan. There are various draft versions of it that are floating in health policy cyberspace and having an incoherent impact on the development of services.</p>
<p>The ministry has mandated the networks to work on some strategic priorities, such as wait lists. But there is little direction about how to achieve these priorities.</p>
<p>Key initiatives, such as diabetes, involve integrated planning with physicians and public health units - but the network funds neither group and there is little direction about how the system components are supposed to work together.</p>
<p>Recent legislation lacks coherence. The 2006 Local Health System Integration Act does not refer to public health. The 2008 Health Protection and Promotion Act does not mention the health networks.</p>
<p>It came as a surprise this year that the LHINs had nothing to do with preparations for pandemic influenza.</p>
<p>The ministry should finish its strategic plan and make it public. It also needs to rethink the ill-advised health network borders that cross county lines. Most southern Ontario networks deal with many public health units and most public health unit's deal with more than one LHIN.</p>
<p>Primary health-care reform continues with little direction. More than 50 per cent of private family doctors are involved with some new model of primary health care but evaluations of a pre-2005 version raised concerns about value and effectiveness. Interestingly, the low- profile, 35-year-old community health centres program gets the best marks so far but the ministerial CHC branch has disappeared.</p>
<p>The eHealth problems showed that government has so little expertise in certain technical areas that it needed to hire consultants to develop strategy. Those same consultants then hired other consultants to implement it.</p>
<p>The government needs to ensure that it has its own in-house expertise to develop strategy and manage its implementation.</p>
<p>Queen's Park also needs to develop a new political strategy. Government mainly conducts its policy discussions in closed rooms where the discussions are too often framed inappropriately from the beginning. At other times, government "rock stars" fan out to issue the latest directive to the rank and file with little discussion or debate.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, when Larry Grossman was health minister in a Bill Davis government, he energized the province's health policy by organizing dialogues between health-care providers and smart citizens not from health care.</p>
<p>Winston Churchill said that democracy is the worst system except for all the rest. If Matthews wishes to avoid the heat faced by her predecessors, she will let more light shine on the province's health policy debates.</p>

<p>MONTREAL -- A new poll that suggests a quarter of Quebec workers would go to work with the H1N1 virus illustrates the need for a workplace culture that promotes a common-sense approach to fighting swine flu, experts say.</p>
<p>In the poll released Thursday, 25 per cent of respondents said they would not stay home even if diagnosed with H1N1. One-third of men said they would go to work if sick.</p>
<p>The poll illustrates a workplace culture that rewards a work-at-all-costs attitude and discourages employees from taking sick time, said Andrew Simor, head of microbiology and infectious diseases at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.</p>
<p>"The history and the culture we have is that you're a bit of a wimp if you take time off from work because you're sick, and there are also factors related to concerns about sick benefits ... In light of the pandemic, I think people should be rethinking that," Simor said.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq agreed, reiterating Thursday that people should not come to work if they have H1N1.</p>

<p>For Patrick Chan, the sore calf might be connected to the swine flu.</p>
<p>The Canadian figure skating media darling confirmed Thursday that he was pulling out of his season-opening competition, next week's <span class="companylink">Rostelecom</span> Cup Grand Prix in Moscow, due to a tear in his left calf.</p>
<p>Chan, 18, was feeling ill when he came to Vancouver last month for a Skate Canada camp.</p>
<p>He said that the symptoms were similar to H1N1, and said he's since learned that the antibiotics he took as a result could have contributed to a loss of muscle mass.</p>
<p>Combine that with ongoing training, he said, and it likely led to the injury.</p>
<p>Still, he said he's feeling a lot better now.</p>
<p>"It's about 60 per cent healthy," said Chan, the defending world silver medalist who has been hampered in training for the past month or so.</p>
<p>"It's not really painful. I'm still able to skate. It's not too serious. It's something we wanted to look at and catch early.</p>
<p>"There was a chance that if I went to Russia and tried to grind it out, I could finish the long program and tear that much more of my muscle."</p>
<p>Or, as Chan admitted bluntly of this Olympic year, "It may be selfish to say, but the Grand Prixs aren't of very big importance."</p>
<p>Mike Slipchuk, Skate Canada's director of high performance, guesses that Chan should be 100 per cent in the next "10 to 14 days."</p>
<p>Both Slipchuk and Chan talked about him focusing now on Skate Canada International, which goes Nov. 19-22 in Kitchener, Ont.</p>
<p>"I think the only disadvantage," Chan, a Toronto native, said of missing the Russia event, "is not having the chance to show the program and not having the chance to fine tune the program, especially in a competition.</p>
<p>"I'm very hungry to go to Skate Canada now."</p>
<p>Several other prospects for the Canadian figure skating side for Vancouver 2010 are beginning their seasons this weekend with the Grand Prix opener, the Trophee <span class="companylink">Eric Bompard</span> in Paris.</p>
<p>Among those competing are two-time reigning national ice dance champions Scott Moir and Tessa Virtue and reigning national pairs titleholders Bryce Davison and Jessica Dube.</p>
<p>Five-time reigning Canadian women's champion Joannie Rochette's first official event is the Cup of China Grand Prix Oct. 29-Nov.1 in Beijing.</p>

<p>The swine-flu virus is spreading rapidly throughout California, public health officials said Thursday, citing physician reports of higher-than-normal flu illnesses for this time of year.</p>
<p>More than five per cent of patients coming into doctor's offices are presenting flu-like symptoms, which is much higher than the usual two per cent, according to an estimate based on about 50 physicians across California who monitor flu activity for the state.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pork producers can access funds; Advance payments under Agristability may keep operations afloat</b>
</div><div>Murray Mandryk </div>
<div>Saskatchewan News Network; Regina Leader-Post</div>
<div>421 words</div><div>15 October 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>D1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>
</p>
<p>Struggling pork producers will be able to apply for as much as 75 per cent of their pending 2009 AgriStability payment, according to a joint federal-provincial announcement Wednesday.</p>
<p>But Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister Bob Bjornerud acknowledged that payouts from the Targeted Advance Payments (TAP) program under AgriStabilty are accessing money from a program producers already pay into and that this won't be a complete fix for the troubled pork sector.</p>
<p>"We're borrowing from Peter to pay Paul -- let's be honest about it," Bjornerud told reporters. "But, on the other hand, it kind of speeds that process up (of getting needed money in producers' hands)."</p>
<p>As part of the national plan to help Canadian livestock producers, pork producers also qualified for TAP last year. Producers will soon be sent a letter informing them of their TAP contribution and how they can apply for it.</p>
<p>Bjornerud said the costs won't be known until the government starts getting responses to the advance payment applications.</p>
<p>The agriculture minister explained that some potential applicants won't qualify because at least 50 per cent of income has to be derived from hogs, according to TAP rules. That may cut out some of the smaller producers who are already facing a late harvest and a poor quality crop, he said.</p>
<p>However, Bjornerud noted too many producers are solely into hogs and those with a good crop this year might have something to fall back on.</p>
<p>Bjornerud admitted that Canadian producers are likely worse off than a year ago -- partly because of the hit the pork industry has taken in the wake of the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu, and partly because of a strong Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>Both the minister and the Saskatchewan pork industry hoped there would be light at the end of the tunnel by now.</p>
<p>SaskPork president Joe Kleinsasser of Outlook agreed the industry had hoped to be "out of the tunnel before the train came," but stressed that the ability to access TAP money will help.</p>
<p>"We need every lifeline we can get," Kleinsasser said, adding the pork industry is a proud one and "doesn't like to come to anyone with their hand out."</p>
<p>Kleinsasser added he hoped the industry would see positive returns by the second quarter of 2010 and that the TAP payments might see the industry through until then.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Passive-aggressive Norwegians snub Bush</b>
</div><div>Les MacPherson </div>
<div>The StarPhoenix</div>
<div>715 words</div><div>15 October 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>
</p>
<p>FOR THE SAKE of a cheap political shot, the committee of Norwegian politicians that bestows the Nobel Peace Prize has done a disservice to the very man they seek to honour.</p>
<p>Now U.S. President Barack Obama gets to stand up and accept a prestigious award he does not deserve. It makes him look unworthy.</p>
<p>This could not have been the committee's intention. More likely, the idea was to cock a snoot at the departed George Bush by declaring, in effect, that any U.S. president who manifestly is not George Bush deserves a Nobel prize. Obama is just a convenient stick for the Nobel committee to use on Bush. Never mind if the stick, too, is battered in the process.</p>
<p>Obama doesn't deserve the Nobel prize, but neither does he deserve to answer for a regrettable decision made by some passive-aggressive Norwegians. Sure, he could have declined, but he'd also be declining nearly $2 million in prize money. That is a powerful inducement to graciously accept, deserving or not. So now Obama looks unworthy and greedy, too. Thanks so much, Nobel prize committee.</p>
<p>To drag him into this was entirely unnecessary. Nobel trustees could have snubbed Bush without drawing attention to Obama's yet limited contributions to world peace. Rather, they should have awarded the prize to everyone in the world except George Bush. He'd have been smeared just the same but without getting any on Obama.</p>
<p>The attendant Nobel prize money could have been divided equally among everyone in the world except Bush. It works out to a little more than two-100ths of a cent apiece for each of the world's 6.7 billion inhabitants, minus one.</p>
<p>STILL WITH the world leaders, what does Prime Minister Stephen Harper have in common with former U.S. president Bill Clinton? And what does former talk show host Arsenio Hall have in common with Canada's National Arts Centre?</p>
<p>Maybe this: Clinton was trailing in the polls in the 1992 presidential campaign when he went on Arsenio's show, put on a pair of Ray-Ban Wayfarers and played Heartbreak Hotel on the saxophone. There are serious political analysts who say this was the moment when Clinton turned around the campaign. He finally had made an impression nationally, and voters liked it. Clinton suddenly was cool. The polls soon thereafter turned in his favour. Five months later, he defeated George Bush Sr. for the first of his two terms in office.</p>
<p>Alas, Arsenio did not fare as well. His show was soon thereafter cancelled and little has been heard of him since. All but forgotten today, he was for a year or two in the early '90s the hottest thing in show business. Behold how celebrity endures.</p>
<p>Flash forward to Prime Minister Stephen Harper's charming performance of With a Little Help From My Friends the other week at the National Arts Centre Gala. He never looked better. Cool would be overstating it, but the PM at least came off as human. For him, this is a major breakthrough.</p>
<p>Coincidentally or not, Harper has since been ascendant in the polls. They say he's flirting with the level of support required for a majority government.</p>
<p>That's one more reason for ambitious parents to keep their kids in music lessons.</p>
<p>FINALLY, I NOTICE that, due to the threat of the H1N1 flu virus, hand sanitizer dispensers are now almost everywhere. They're in the office, in schools, in the gym, in people's homes, in public buildings, in women's purses. . . . I just hope we don't find out someday that the stuff causes cancer.</p>
<p>I'm still reluctant to use hand sanitizer except in a hospital setting. I don't want others to think I regard them as disease vectors.</p>
<p>Someone else who is not using a lot of hand sanitizer is Michael Bloomberg, the popular mayor of New York City. In an interview with The New Yorker magazine, Bloomberg was disdainful of politicians who habitually disinfect with Purell right after shaking hands: "I've always found that you're in the wrong business if that's what you do."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>ill wind could add to leafs' woes</b>

<p>They eat together, travel in a pack from city to city, room together, lift weights together, skate together, sweat together, and, so far this season, the Toronto Maple Leafs have been losing hockey games together.</p>
<p>There has been a pandemic of mediocre play by a team with playoff expectations. Losing is an illness Leafs head coach Ron Wilson is confident his players can cure with hard work, attention to defensive detail, a show of courage from a crew of forwards that has been buzzing around the perimeter instead of crashing the enemy net, and better goaltending from starter Vesa Toskala. These are the old-fashioned remedies for what ails the Leafs.</p>
<p>But there is a new sickness lurking beyond the control of any coach. It is a sickness no amount of practice can shake, and one that could conceivably send the Leafs into a funk far worse than the one they are already in.</p>
<p>"The last time I had the flu was when I was in Vancouver," Leafs general manager Brian Burke said. "There is nothing you can do, just stay in bed for 24 hours, and that is about the full cycle." But the H1N1 virus, or swine flu, is a whole new flu. And ordinary people - and NHL players - have not been vaccinated for it yet and possess no natural immunity against it.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Schabas, the medical officer for Hastings and Prince Edward Counties and the former chief medical officer of Ontario, was watching from afar while the flu ran its course in the southern hemisphere. He said a comprehensive study of H1N1 has just emerged from New Zealand. Researchers there indicate it has a "five-per-cent clinical attack rate," meaning about one in 20 New Zealanders were felled by it.</p>
<p>"That one in 20 can happen in clusters," Dr. Schabas said. "And, obviously, if it gets into a team situation and four or five players get sick at once, it could have serious consequences - especially for (the Leafs) - given their precarious standing." Toronto plans on stocking its team medical cabinet with a sufficient amount of swine flu vaccine once it becomes available in November. It will be used to inoculate the players, their families and team personnel.</p>
<p>But by then it might already be too late.</p>
<p>Dr. Schabas is already seeing cases in Ontario, and although they have been relatively mild, the flu can be a dangerous illness and it is generally not fun to get.</p>
<p>Former Canadien Mike Komisarek was well acquainted with what a queasy tummy, chattering teeth and a high fever can do to a hockey team with the Canadiens in 2007. Ground zero was a game against Washington in early January. One of the players became violently ill in the dressing room. Two more became sick on the flight home.</p>
<p>"That night, I woke up with the severe flu," Komisarek said. "I couldn't hold anything down, and then I think we had back-to-back games - a Saturday-Sunday set - and the flu knocked out, like, eight guys. You were getting an IV before the game and an IV between periods."</p>
<p>Komisarek shed 10 pounds in 48 hours. Things got so bad that practice was cancelled to keep the players apart and try and stop the flu from spreading. The Canadiens' dressing room at the Bell Centre was sterilized, and the medical cabinet scrubbed clean and re-stocked with untainted products.</p>
<p>"I thought the next step was going to be guys walking around with masks on their faces," Komisarek said.</p>
<p>The Canadiens finished the flu-ridden campaign out of the playoffs. There were culprits besides the virulent bug for the team's failure, but a dressing room full of sick people did not help.</p>
<p>Komisarek is not sure what he is going to do this season to ward off H1N1. He knows the vaccine is on its way, but wants more information about the flu shot before he rolls up his sleeve for a team doctor. As it is, Toronto has taken some preventive steps to stop an outbreak, such as stocking the dressing room with hand sanitizer and having each player drink from his own water bottle during practice.</p>
<p>But personal water bottles cannot guarantee personal health.</p>
<p>"H1N1 probably causes a much higher infection rate than the typical seasonal flu," Dr. Schabas said.</p>
<p>And if the flu bug bites into the Leafs and sidelines four or five front-line players, fuelling a four- or five-game losing skid that ultimately ends with a fifth consecutive season without a playoff game in Toronto, what then?</p>
<p>"Well," Dr. Schabas said, "at least they are going to have an excuse this time."</p>

</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -- One of Vancouver's low-barrier homeless shelters is ordering 50 new bunk beds to make more space for people before the cold weather hits.</p>
<p>First United Church on East Hastings Street provided shelter for an average of 150 people a night this summer, one of the Homeless Emergency Action Team facilities that makes extra efforts not to turn anyone away. Now that the cooler weather has set in, the number has already spiked to 230 people a night.</p>
<p>“The fact that we got 230 people tells us that we may be seeing some serious numbers in the winter,” said Rev. Ric Matthews of First United, adding that other shelters remain full as well.</p>
<p>The move to buy the 50 new bunk beds is a first for the church. People who come into the church usually hunker down on a pew or on the floor for the night.</p>
<p>The absence of beds was intentional, Mr. Matthews said. “People are here because they feel more comfortable than being at a formal shelter. These are the folk who are going to blow out when they go into formal shelters or have already done so.”</p>
<p>Unlike formal shelters, First United does not take the names of residents. Mr. Matthews said the church has tried to maintain an atmosphere of refuge, more akin to an outdoor park than a shelter.</p>
<p>To preserve this culture, the first batch of bunk beds will be placed outside the sanctuary, he said.</p>
<p>“People value the fact that it is a church. There's something reassuring about sleeping in the sanctuary of a church. We don't want to break that,” he said.</p>
<p>The addition of bunk beds also has potential health benefits. Mr. Matthews said the church has realized it is important to have more structure and space, particularly with the H1N1 threat. There is talk of moving some of the beds into a smaller room that could be designated as an infirmary.</p>
<p>The beds, which come complete with bedbug-resistant mattresses, cost $500 apiece.</p>
<p>The church receives operational funding from BC Housing through March, 2010, and may receive some further support for the bed order, but it will rely on fundraising for the bulk of the money needed to purchase the beds.</p>
<p>“BC Housing is seeking to try to help, but their funds are extremely limited,” Mr. Matthews said. “They are doing what they can to find within their budgets for existing funds for bed orders like this.”</p>
<p>Anyone interested in making a donation can contact the church office at 604-681-8365, ext. 117.</p>

<div>SWINE FLU / DUBIOUS CURES</div>
<div>Globe Life</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Flusploitation: Beware of H1N1 snake oil</b>
</div><div>CARLY WEEKS </div>

</p>
<p>Battling the H1N1 flu pandemic may not be so tough after all. That is, if you believe the marketing claims of companies who say they have developed products that can cure, treat or prevent the notorious influenza virus.</p>
<p>The feared resurgence of the H1N1 virus has brought with it a plethora of websites offering everything from air purifiers, herbal supplements, inhalers and even body washes said to prevent or cure infection with the virus.</p>
<p>To jittery consumers, the idea of buying a shampoo that can protect from H1N1 infection might sound appealing. But there is no solid scientific evidence to back up any of those claims, according to health officials.</p>
<p>Public-health officials are urging the public not to buy H1N1-related products, and Health Canada is preparing to issue a new and expanded warning about products being peddled online that fraudulently claim to cure or treat H1N1.</p>
<p>“Epidemics and widespread public fear are the perfect ground for those types of claims to be taken seriously because people are frightened,” said Margaret Somerville, founding director of the McGill Centre for Medicine, Ethics and Law.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: There are ways to help prevent the spread of influenza. The Public Health Agency of Canada advises Canadians to wash their hands often and use alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60 per cent alcohol.</p>
<p>But consumers who go online to buy pills or potions in hopes of preventing or treating H1N1 will likely find the products are only effective at creating lighter wallets.</p>
<p>One company, Traditional Chinese Medicine Discovery Group, sells four different “prescriptions” as well as a herbal tea consisting of various herbs and extracts, such as puerarin and radix sileris, for the prevention of H1N1.</p>
<p>The company couldn't be reached for comment – a phone number listed on its website automatically disconnects after it's dialled.</p>
<p>Another product being sold online, called Flugonazol, is described as the “best help for prevention and fight against the dangerous swine flu or any other strain of influenza.”</p>
<p>The company's products come in formulations for adults, children and seniors and are sold for about $200 (U.S.) a bottle. The company could not be reached yesterday.</p>
<p>Although there are no proven treatments for H1N1 available for purchase online, consumers might be fooled into thinking these products have been approved for use by a government agency or health body.</p>
<p>Some products, such as face masks, may even do more harm than good.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada says that masks may not prevent the spread of flu in the general public because many people wear them incorrectly.</p>
<p>In addition, people can increase their risk of infection by becoming contaminated with the virus when taking masks on or off.</p>
<p>Masks are often used in a public-health setting, and health-care workers may tell those with H1N1 or symptoms of the virus to wear a mask in order to prevent spreading it to others.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has developed a comprehensive list of websites and companies selling various gels, kits, supplements, sprays and other unauthorized products that make unsubstantiated claims about H1N1 protection or treatment.</p>
<p>In Canada, health officials issued a warning in May against buying counterfeit drugs that claim to treat H1N1.</p>
<p>But over the past few months, Health Canada has been “monitoring the Internet to uncover websites with claims related to products to prevent and/or treat the H1N1 flu outbreak,” spokeswoman Christelle Legault wrote in an e-mail.</p>
<p>The department is preparing to release an updated advisory warning against “fraudulent products” being sold online, she said.</p>
<p>Dozens of companies contacted by the FDA have changed or modified their websites after being contacted, according to the agency. But new sites continue to pop up and individual products are posted on a daily basis on online retail sites such as <span class="companylink">Alibaba.com</span>, making it difficult for authorities to find those who are illegally marketing H1N1-related products.</p>
<p>For instance, searching for “H1N1” on <span class="companylink">Alibaba.com</span> yesterday produced hundreds of results from prospective sellers offering everything from an H1N1 vaccine to rapid flu test kits and “anti-H1N1” masks.</p>
<p>Prof. Somerville said people may be inclined to suspend their disbelief about products geared toward H1N1 because they may be trying to feel in control of a situation that has caused widespread anxiety. But Canadians should be aware that some companies will look to exploit those fears for their own gain, she said.</p>

<p>Today, the head of the Nobel Prize Committee defended the decision to give President Obama this year's Peace Prize saying that Obama's already accomplished quite a bit. When asked for an example, the committee chairman said, "C'mon, he won the freakin' Nobel Peace Prize."</p>
<p>* The Nobel Committee is saying the reason they gave Obama the Peace Prize is for reducing tension around the world. So, the runners-up for this year's Nobel Prize were "red wine" and "the Brookstone 3-Speed Massaging Recliner."</p>
<p>* A new article shows that the phrase used most often by President Obama is "let me be clear." Whereas the phrase used most often by Joe Biden is "Hey, where are you all going?"</p>
<p>* A New York man was arrested last week after allegedly scheduling an appointment with a telemarketer and then punching him. The telemarketer waited until dinner time and then called the police.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Bernie Madoff got into a fight in prison. He's really screwed, now. Bernie and another inmate fought over the stock market. Isn't that how all prison fights start, when you think about it?</p>
<p>* President Obama's health-care plan passed the Senate finance Committee this afternoon. Republicans were disappointed. They had their own version of the health plan -- swine flu masks and Purell.</p>
<p>Craig Ferguson</p>
<p>It's raining here in L.A. Authorities are worried about mudslides, though. The rain can send all sorts of things sliding down -- rocks, mud, loose Baldwins . . .</p>

<p>Jimmy Fallon</p>
<p>The Treasury Department said today that the Taliban is much-better funded than al-Qaeda. al-Qaeda said they'd be doing much better if they hadn't invested with Bernie Madoff.</p>
<p>* Scottish celebrities are trying to prevent Donald Trump from building a huge golf course in Scotland. Trump has a way around them, though. It's called buying Scotland.</p>
<p>Jay Leno</p>
<p>President Obama has promised to end the 'Don't ask, don't tell' policy in the military. So besides winning a Nobel Peace Prize, it looks like he could also get a Tony.</p>

<p>VANCOUVER</p>
<p>Vancouver schools won't be using hand sanitizer to fight the spread of H1N1 flu because officials are worried students will drink it, squirt it or set it on fire.</p>
<p>The alcohol-based, germ-killing gel is considered too risky to be included in the Vancouver School Board's anti-H1N1 arsenal despite being endorsed by the federal government.</p>
<p>Instead, the school board will focus its prevention efforts on handwashing.</p>
<p>Board spokesperson David Weir says with sanitizer's alcohol content of 60 per cent it could be drunk or sprayed in people's eyes.</p>
<p>Weir also noted it carries a manufacturer's warning that it be kept away from children.</p>
<p>Health Canada promotes the use of hand sanitizer and advises in its guidelines that sanitizer stations be employed at schools and daycares.</p>
<p>But the department's top recommendation for keeping hands H1N1-free is plain old soap and water.</p>

<p>WINNIPEG</p>
<p>Canada may be behind other countries in rolling out its H1N1 flu vaccine, but the population should be immunized by Christmas before the virus peaks, the country's chief public health officer said Wednesday.</p>
<p>David Butler-Jones said when the H1N1 vaccine becomes available in early November, Canadians will be immunized faster than people in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>In some jurisdictions, such as Iqaluit, Nunavut, the population will be immunized within a matter of weeks, he said.</p>
<p>"The advantage in Canada that we have is that - while we may not start first with a few people - we will very quickly be able to immunize everybody in Canada who wishes it, in advance of the real peak," Butler-Jones said in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>With health officials pushing everyone to get immunized, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Wednesday he will be one of those rolling up his sleeve.</p>
<p>"My plan is to get the vaccine," he said at a news conference in Wabamun, Alta. "As yet, of course, we haven't actually made a final decision or set a date. We're awaiting final approval of the vaccine but we expect that imminently."</p>
<p>Canada has been criticized for not getting out the vaccine quickly enough when it is already available in the United States and other countries.</p>
<p>The Canadian Medical Association Journal released a modelling study this week that showed vaccine could have a large dampening effect if used early enough to combat a fall wave of H1N1.</p>
<p>But Butler-Jones said Canada is well-positioned compared with the United States and China.</p>
<p>The vaccine used in the U.S. was one intended for healthy people since it contained a small dose of the virus, he said, and the country quickly ran out of that vaccine shortly after it became available.</p>
<p>China doesn't have enough vaccine for its population, Butler-Jones added.</p>
<p>Three million doses a week will be available in Canada once clinical trials and quality tests are complete, he said.</p>
<p>"What we're aiming for … is that before Christmas and before we're in the season of sharing - not just good things but viruses as well - that everybody who wishes to be immunized will have had that opportunity."</p>

<p>The H1N1 pandemic virus is a novel strain that had never been seen before it appeared in the spring and quickly spread around the world. Because it was new, experts couldn't predict how it would behave.</p>
<p>The majority of cases in Canada have turned out to be mild.</p>
<p>Often the seasonal flu strikes elderly people and those with underlying and chronic health problems. The H1N1 virus does not appear to strike elderly people as often and is, in fact, causing severe illness in some young and otherwise healthy people. It is also infecting high-risk groups, however, including pregnant women, and researchers are eager to learn why. One of the five research projects, centred at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, will focus on pregnant women and look at the best ways to reduce infection and why only some pregnant women develop complications.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Top line's up for Grabs; Loose from the Moose, Michael Grabner gets his shot at NHL with Sedin, Burrows</b>
</div><div>ELLIOTT PAP   </div>
<div>VANCOUVER SUN</div>
<div>790 words</div><div>15 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>E1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>It appears only one thing can prevent Michael Grabner from making his NHL debut Friday night in Calgary. That, of course, would be the H1N1 virus, more commonly known as swine flu.</p>
<p>Please, no 'oink-oink' jokes here. Grabner, despite a dismal one-assist NHL pre-season, is pencilled in to play on the team's top line with Henrik Sedin and Alex Burrows. He was summoned Wednesday from the Manitoba Moose after a sizzling four-goal start in the American League.</p>
<p>"I will try to stay in my hotel room and stay away from people," chuckled Grabner, when it was suggested that only an outbreak of something or other could keep him from Friday's lineup.</p>
<p>Last season, Grabner was called up Feb. 27 for a game against Tampa Bay but never saw the ice. Pavol Demitra, who had been doubtful with a finger issue, wound up playing and Grabner took the next plane back to Winnipeg.</p>
<p>This time, Grabner is in. Really. There are no spares in the Canuck camp. He has to play. His three-year wait -- Grabner was drafted 14th overall in 2006 -- is over.</p>
<p>"It's exciting," said the 22-year-old Austrian. "I knew I had to work on some stuff when I got drafted so it's nice to have this day coming. Now it's up to me to make the most of it."</p>
<p>Grabner was informed of his promotion late Tuesday night following Manitoba's 4-2 home loss to the Abbotsford Heat. He was on a plane at 7 a.m. Winnipeg time. Sleep? It's over-rated when the NHL beckons.</p>
<p>"I had to get up at, like, five," Grabner explained. "I got a couple of hours of sleep and then a couple more hours on the plane. But it's all good. I didn't think [the callup] was going to be that quick. I got off to a good start down there and the team was doing well so I think that helped me, too.</p>
<p>"I'm just going to try and go out and do what I do in Winnipeg. I'm playing with great players and I have to take the chance. They are great set-up guys so it's going to be a lot of fun to play with them."</p>
<p>In addition to practising on the first line Wednesday, Grabner also saw duty on the second-unit power play with Ryan Kesler, Kyle Wellwood, Alex Edler and Christian Ehrhoff.</p>
<p>Canuck head coach Alain Vigneault has no intention of burying Grabner on the third or fourth line, although that may happen if the Austrian skates around in a fog as he did for much of the NHL pre-season.</p>
<p>"Grabs was the best player the last three games Manitoba played and, obviously with two of our top six forwards out in Demitra and Daniel [Sedin], we needed someone to be able to step into that role and assume that job," Vigneault said. "Michael is an offensive player with great speed and a pretty good touch around the net so we're hoping he'll be able to fill that role for us."</p>
<p>The Grabner experiment means a return to the third line for Steve Bernier, who was skating Wednesday with Wellwood and Ryan Johnson, the latter moved up from fourth-line centre.</p>
<p>Rick Rypien now centres a new fourth unit between wingers Darcy Hordichuk and Tanner Glass.</p>
<p>Johnson said moving up a line and switching positions won't pose any problems for him.</p>
<p>"I've played some wing for all sorts of reasons over the years," Johnson noted. "Last year, they'd put me on left wing in the last 10 minutes of a game and, in St. Louis, they'd use me there when needed. So it's not an adjustment at all."</p>
<p>ICE CHIPS:</p>
<p>Vigneault said that defenceman Sami</p>
<p>Salo's knee injury will likely be a 3-5 week rehab process... The Canucks have</p>
<p>only 18 healthy skaters but won't be calling up anyone else due to salary cap considerations... Former Canuck Matt Pettinger has signed a 25-game agreement with the Moose and is expected to make his Manitoba debut Friday against the Lake Erie Monsters. Pettinger was out of work and skating with the ECHL's Victoria Salmon Kings.</p>

<p>Re: Coughing leads to abrupt end to bus ride, Oct. 10</p>
<p>The hysteria surrounding the H1N1 flu panic has reached fever pitch. One can't help but recall the SARS panic of several years ago. While each death is regrettable, Canada had 43 deaths that were "probable" SARS cases, roughly the amount killed by cars every six days in Canada. (And we had the third highest incidence of SARS in the world!)</p>
<p>Why are we not inundated with countless news stories about the threat to our health posed by cars? The so-called swine flu should be a non-issue. At this writing, H1N1 flu is believed to have caused about 4,525 deaths worldwide. As regrettable as that is, keep in mind that 4,525 is the number of deaths caused by pharmaceutical drugs -- used as directed -- every eight days in the United States alone. (Figures are from the Archives of Internal Medicine.) Why are we not inundated with countless news stories about the threat to our health posed by pharmaceutical drugs?</p>
<p>That people feel compelled to ask others to refrain from using public transit because of a cough is beyond ridiculous. It would seem that a concurrent illness has recently broken out, a pathological fear fuelled by the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and induced by media hype: I call it "Swine Flu Over the Cuckoo's Nest."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>An industry gone hog wild; Feeling down on the farm: It's been a hard year for swine farmers, and Wayne Bartels is a victim of a dying market. Unfortunately, so are his 4,500 pigs</b>
</div><div>Jennifer Yang    </div>

<div>851 words</div><div>15 October 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>B01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star    </div>
</p>
<p>YORK -- This week, for the first time ever, Wayne Bartels' hog farm went black.</p>
<p>Bartels owes <span class="companylink">Haldimand County Hydro</span> about $11,000 and on Tuesday morning, the utility decided to pull the plug on his 100-acre farm, (40 hectares) located just south of Hamilton. His two hog barns are now running on power from diesel-fuelled backup generators, but when the fuel runs out his farm might go dark again.</p>
<p>This time, it might be for good. His computerized feed systems will stop, the ventilation system will shut down and his 4,500 pigs will slowly begin to suffocate in their enclosed barns.</p>
<p>But the 36-year-old, who calls himself a "farmer by blood," promises this worst-case scenario will never happen. Not under his watch.</p>
<p>"It's not going to come to that," said Bartels, who co-owns Bartside Farms with his brother Geoff. "If they're in there suffocating, I'll be in there suffocating with them."</p>
<p>It's been a devastating year for farmers like Bartels: many have declared bankruptcy or faded from the industry. This month, the federal government released details of a "transition" program for hog farmers looking to exit the industry. At Ontario Pork, an association that represents hog farmers, hundreds have called to ask about it.</p>
<p>For hog producers, it's been a perfect storm of toxic conditions: skyrocketing feed prices, an economic recession and H1N1 fears, which have caused worried consumers to stop buying pork en masse. According to Keith Robbins, spokesman for Ontario Pork, Ontario hog farmers took a $10 million hit in the spring when H1N1 first hit.</p>
<p>"All of a sudden, your animals aren't worth anything anymore," Bartels said.</p>
<p>Bartels said H1N1 has pummelled his bottom line and in the spring, a 55-pound pig that normally went for $60 was selling for as low as $5. In August Bartels was forced to euthanize 600 piglets, a decision he calls devastating but necessary. Young pigs had become essentially worthless and he could no longer afford to feed them. "That is such a huge painstaking decision for a farmer to make."</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Haldimand County Hydro</span> officials say they sent numerous warnings to Bartside Farms. A final notice was mailed on Sept. 30, giving Bartels two weeks to pay his debt.</p>
<p>When Haldimand Hydro employees tried to leave Bartels' property Tuesday morning, a desperate Bartels tried to block their exit with a 60-tonne manure tanker, fearing his herd would die if his backup generators failed. Eventually he relented after the OPP threatened to charge him with forcible confinement.</p>
<p>"It's sort of at the end of the line here, unfortunately," said Doug Curtiss, <span class="companylink">Haldimand County Hydro</span> interim president and CEO. "I think we've been fairly lenient with the situation already."</p>
<p>Curtiss said Bartside Farms has two options for getting back online: either have Bartels pay off his debt or have an outside agency, such as the SPCA, ship the pigs elsewhere.</p>
<p>But Bartels insists his credit has always been "impeccable" and he's never missed an electricity payment until July. He said Haldimand County has been "stubborn as a rock," even when he told them about a new federal relief program for which he is eligible.</p>
<p>The program will allow hog producers to access credit, and Bartels says he'll likely access about $600,000 in loans. His appointment to meet with creditors is Friday, however, and for <span class="companylink">Haldimand County Hydro</span> that's too late.</p>
<p>"At this point, I'm not sure he even knows he's going to get (the loans)," Curtiss said. "He hasn't made any payment arrangements with us."</p>
<p>Bartels blames the Ontario government for not doing enough to help struggling hog farmers. He said the government offered financial assistance to hog producers in 2008 but he was ineligible due to a clerical oversight.</p>
<p>He said an outdated list was used to decide which farmers were eligible for loans, so new entrants into the hog industry weren't counted. Bartels is a lifelong farmer but only began hog operations in 2006.</p>
<p>For now, Bartels' farm is off the grid but he says he'll do whatever it takes to keep the lights on and his pigs alive. Several farmers, friends and strangers, have donated diesel to keep the barns operational.</p>
<p>Bartels is from a long line of farmers but today only he and his brother are still in the industry. He has five young children who love the farm, he says, and losing the pigs will be like losing a way of life.</p>
<p>"I'm fighting to hang on to my farm," Bartels said. "I am not a person that lays down and dies."</p>

<p>Lillian Malcovitch winced after getting her first-ever flu shot Wednesday. Not because it hurt, but because the retired nurse doesn't like getting needles.</p>
<p>"I'm fine," the senior said afterwards at St. James Collegiate gymnasium, one of 12 seasonal flu shot clinics being held around the city for three days.</p>
<p>The healthy, active woman decided to get the seasonal flu shot for the first time to help protect herself and her diabetic husband from "all this extra stuff going around."</p>
<p>The seasonal flu clinics, running from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. today and Friday, are a chance to prepare for H1N1 vaccine clinics to come, said Sande Harlos, medical officer of health with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority.</p>
<p>"This is a very good learning opportunity," Harlos said at the St. James clinic Wednesday.</p>
<p>The immunization program is enlisting the help of nursing, pharmacy and technical college students and volunteers from organizations including the Red Cross and St. John's Ambulance.</p>
<p>Health officials are evaluating the seasonal flu clinics and how they're run as they prepare for an H1N1 immunization program -- expected by the first week in November.</p>
<p>They're trying to immunize as many people as possible as quickly as possible to prevent its spread.</p>
<p>By midday Wednesday, 3,500 doses of the seasonal flu vaccine were administered at the dozen clinics.</p>
<p>In the first hour of the seasonal flu clinic, more than 180 shots were administered at the school gym in St. James.</p>
<p>Eight-month-old Connor Robbins was the youngest in the crowd to receive the seasonal flu shot.</p>
<p>"It was recommended for children six to 23 months," said his mother, Erin Robbins. "I wanted to be safe." She also got the seasonal flu shot, even though she has no underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>The first-time mom said she knows there are questions about whether getting the seasonal flu shot makes people more susceptible to contracting the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"I talked to my brother-in-law who's a doctor," and paid attention to media reports, and decided to get the seasonal flu shot, said Robbins.</p>
<p>"Better safe than sorry."</p>
<p>The whole process took about 45 minutes, Robbins said.</p>
<p>Six nurses, 10 volunteers and four pharmacy technicians moved the patients through the seasonal flu clinic in St. James, keeping an eye on the vaccinated people to make sure they didn't have a bad reaction to the shot.</p>
<p>At another seasonal flu clinic in Seven Oaks, a crowd of mostly elderly Winnipeggers waited about 20 minutes to get vaccinated by supervised nursing students. Those waiting for shots at a McPhillips Street hotel watched a video that explained only about one in a million people vaccinated suffer serious side-effects. Staff and volunteers kept track of patients by scanning bar codes on their vaccination forms at each stage of the process.</p>
<p>By Friday evening, 20,000 people around the city are expected to get the seasonal flu vaccine at the clinics.</p>
<p>Residents of personal care homes and other long-term care facilities will continue to get their seasonal flu shots at their residences, the WRHA says. Doses are also being administered at emergency shelters and downtown hotels where people reside.</p>
<p>Seasonal flu shots are recommended for people 65 and over, residents of personal care homes and other long-term care facilities, children from six months to 23 months, people with chronic illnesses, heart or lung disease or weakened immune systems, and pregnant women.</p>

<p>Health care is unlike any other business; when you have customers, it costs you money and you do not make money on the transaction. You can't turn customers away or close shop when your budget is exhausted.</p>
<p>Throw in local health integration networks (LHINs), which arbitrarily set a budget on something that you can't budget for - like H1N1, major accidents, major outbreaks, criminal activity resulting in critical care, heart attacks, an aging population - and you have a recipe for financial failure.</p>
<p>Government should be the primary financier for health care unless you want hospitals to become like those in the U.S., where the cost recovery is passed on to the users and only the rich can afford health care.</p>

<p>COMMON sense and a doctor's note will prevail if H1N1 strikes the school system, whether it's a pregnant teacher staying home or a student missing a test, Manitoba School Boards Association vice-president Jacquie Field said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Anytime you have a doctor's certificate saying you shouldn't be in the workplace, you follow the doctor," said Field, a trustee in Pembina Trails School Division.</p>
<p>Manitoba Teachers' Society and MSBA issued a joint statement Wednesday assuring parents that they would place the safety of students and staff first during any flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Educators have said previously that pregnant teachers should be extra vigilant during a flu outbreak, but that health officials had said pregnant teachers should continue to work unless they are ill.</p>
<p>Field said there is no province-wide policy on pregnant teachers during a flu outbreak.Field said the union and employer would work together locally on a case-by-case basis, if a doctor advised that a pregnant teacher should not be in the workplace.</p>
<p>Pregnant teachers and teachers with health problems could also switch schools temporarily if H1N1 strikes their regular school, MTS president Pat Isaak said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Isaak said that teachers have done that before, such as when measles has struck a school. "We've said to teachers all along, first and foremost, consult your physician," Isaak said.</p>
<p>"If a doctor feels someone is unsafe, the union and school division would work to accommodate people," Field said.</p>
<p>The teachers and trustees said they would work together at the local level to deal with any issues that arise during a flu outbreak, including any staff issues involving collective agreements.</p>
<p>The two organizations urged everyone involved in the school system to be reasonable and flexible if H1N1 hits Manitoba schools.</p>
<p>Field said that Manitoba Health would make the decision on any school closings. There are already alternatives for students who can't write exams because of weather or illness, Field said.</p>
<p>Isaak said that she hopes everyone is on the same page during any outbreak, but would not speculate about whether all senior administrators in Manitoba school divisions would prove to be open to pregnant teachers switching schools temporarily or staying home if their physician felt they were at risk.</p>

<p>Medical researchers trying to answer some of the mysteries about the H1N1 virus got a $2.4 million federal funding boost Wednesday.</p>
<p>Through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, five new projects will be funded over the next two years and work on them is beginning "immediately," according to Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>Experts couldn't predict how H1N1 would behave and pandemic preparedness plans had to be adjusted as more was learned about the illness.</p>
<p>A project at the University of B.C. will look into new drug therapies to treat patients with severe infections.</p>
<p>The majority of cases in Canada have turned out to be mild -- the virus has been linked to 79 deaths -- but more than 1,500 people have required hospitalization and close to 300 of those patients were in intensive care units.</p>

<p>A death in the province earlier this month has health officials back on heightened alert that a second wave of the deadly H1N1 virus is imminent.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, the deaths of four people were attributed to the virus. Another death occurred recently, but Dr. Saqib Shahab, Saskatchewan's deputy chief medical health officer, stopped short of linking it to flu.</p>
<p>Asked by a reporter about rumours that a teenage boy in the Wynyard area succumbed to the illness, Shahab couldn't confirm the death was H1N1-related.</p>
<p>"At the moment, deaths that are confirmed by the pandemic remains at four," he told a news conference Wednesday afternoon, adding, "We are investigating an additional death at the moment. That investigation is not complete."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Does H1N1 mean the end of the handshake? Greeting is now suspect in fight against swine flu</b>
</div><div>Francine Kopun </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>

<p>Janina Palhares has been declining handshakes since she became pregnant with her second child three months ago. Mechanic Rocco Visconti, 65, thinks not shaking hands is the smart thing to do at his age. At Leaside United Church, parishioners no longer shake hands as a sign of peace.</p>
<p>"It's been hard to get used to," says Rev. John Smith, who wants to keep his congregation safe from the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each service, he demonstrates a sideways hug that can be used instead of the face-to-face hug.</p>
<p>"People really do like touching one another, but they want to do it in ways that are safe for everybody," he says.</p>
<p>The handshake as a form of greeting has been in use at least since ancient Greece and Rome, and probably earlier, says David Givens, director of the Center for Nonverbal Studies in Spokane, Wash. The threat of contracting H1N1 is making many people rethink and even withdraw from the practice, at least for now.</p>
<p>As a producer for Citytv's morning show, Palhares, 40, meets a lot of people in a day. She used to shake hands with all of them. Not any more.</p>
<p>"I think everyone understands, to be honest. I just use the pregnancy angle," she says.</p>
<p>Pregnant women are not more likely to get H1N1, but recent studies have revealed that young women and pregnant women are more likely to suffer serious complications.</p>
<p>For his part, Visconti says people understand when he doesn't offer his hand in greeting. Hello and a smile seem to be enough.</p>
<p>H1N1 has been spreading since it was first recognized in Mexico and southern Californian in April. You can catch it from inhaling air contaminated by people coughing, sneezing or spitting, and from contaminated surfaces, including hands.</p>
<p>The virus can live in a droplet of water for several minutes or even a couple of hours, says Dr. Bonnie Henry, author of Soap and Water and Common Sense: The Definitive Guide to Viruses, Bacteria, Parasites and Disease.</p>
<p>So you actually can get it from a doorknob or a handshake.</p>
<p>Dr. Donald Low, microbiologist-in-chief in the department of microbiology at Mount Sinai Hospital, thinks it's time to rethink the handshake.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's time to break this chain of transmission by adopting the Obama 'fist pump' or the Thai greeting referred to as the wai (which consists of a slight bow, with the palms pressed together in a prayer-like fashion)," he said in an email to the Star.</p>
<p>Others are also advocating replacing the handshake with something less effective at transmitting germs. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's resident medical expert, told an NPR radio panel in July that he advocates bumping elbows instead.</p>
<p>Churches have taken a leading role. At St. Matthew's United Church on St. Clair Ave. W., minister Katherine Brittain has her parishioners clasp their hands together and bow to one another and say peace, or Namaste. Churches in St. Catharines and Kitchener have also banned the handshake.</p>
<p>Changing how people greet one another can be done. Author Henry remembers that during the Ebola outbreak in Uganda, where she was a senior consultant to the World Health Organization, people began greeting each other by touching their feet together, at the suggestion of a local religious leader.</p>
<p>It didn't last long. As soon the last person to contract Ebola recovered, locals returned to greeting one other with a hug and a kiss.</p>
<p>The handshake is, in fact, growing in popularity around the world, says Givens. "It's a really primate sort of thing, to reach out and touch another primate."</p>
<p>"To substitute another greeting ritual would be really tough and there would be a lot of resistance to it. In this country, I could see Republicans getting up in arms if somebody would try to change the handshake and do the salaam. That would invite a lot of criticism."</p>
<p>People touch their faces anywhere from eight to 80 times a minute, says Givens. Our fingertips, lips, tongue and the area around the nose are tender areas, with lots of nerve endings, and primates tend to console themselves but touching their hands to those parts, or by touching them together. As a result he says, there is little chance that after you shake someone's hand, you'll wash your hands before you touch your face. You won't even know you've done it.</p>
<p>Adrian Caravello, food and beverage coordinator for the school of hospitality at George Brown College, where learning how to shake hands is integrated into the curriculum, says a good handshake is part of making a good impression.</p>
<p>Declining to shake hands requires an explanation, he says, although "I'm feeling under the weather," is usually enough information.</p>
<p>Henry says that if the virus becomes more severe or virulent, people might want to reconsider the handshake. If she were pregnant, she says, she wouldn't give up shaking hands, but she'd carry a hand sanitizer around with her and use it often.</p>
<p>For the moment, most people seem to agree. Sales of hand sanitizers went through the roof this summer. According to reports in the business media, <span class="companylink">Johnson & Johnson</span> saw sales of its Purell Purifying Essentials brand jump by more than 1,000 per cent.</p>
<p>"I like the feel of hands and how I imagine I learn about people from the texture of their skin or the energy in their grip," says Arlene Bishop, 44, a Toronto songwriter whose 2004 album Cut a Man's Heart Out featured the shape of a heart created by her hands. "I'm a hand shaker and I haven't stopped. It hadn't occurred to me to stop."</p>

<p>Russia is opening its borders to more Canadian beef, a "reinvigoration" of a market that took a hit after the discovery of mad cow disease more than six years ago, Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The Russian economy is still growing and we want to make sure opportunities for our farmers are growing as well," said the minister, wrapping up an agricultural trade mission to that country.</p>
<p>Ritz, the MP for Battlefords-Lloydminster, said Russia and Canada have formalized an agreement in principle reached in June to open the Russian border to bone-in beef cuts from animals under 30 months of age.</p>
<p>The countries have also agreed to market access for Canadian boneless beef from animals over 30 months of age, with the Canada Beef Export Federation estimating the value of trade in under-30-month beef and over-30-month boneless beef to be worth up to $32 million.</p>
<p>"There's some homework left to do in Russia, but we received firm commitments that this tremendous progress will continue," Ritz said.</p>
<p>Ritz said officials will also work toward giving Russian importers access by the end of the year to Canadian beef offal -- trimmings for which there's little appetite in North America -- a market that could be worth $10 million to Canada.</p>
<p>The discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, in Canada in 2003 created trade headaches that to some extent are still being felt today.</p>
<p>Canada has already been exporting some cuts of beef to Russia, but with the move to open the border to a wider variety of cuts "we can start to put together shipments that are commercially viable. So that's the good news from this standpoint," Ritz said.</p>
<p>Russia will also open market access for Canadian exports of sheep breeding stock.</p>
<p>Ritz said work is also underway to resume normal pork exports to Russia, which were disrupted due to fallout from the discovery of the H1N1 flu, a new influenza virus transmitted between people that was initially dubbed swine flu.</p>
<p>"It's a matter of having some Russian officials travel to Canada to reopen some of the plants that were delisted. We're quite buoyed by the fact there seems to be a mood to get that done very, very quickly," Ritz told reporters in a conference call.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Diabetes a quiet, growing epidemic</b>
</div><div>Margaret Munro </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>1676 words</div><div>14 October 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>
</p>
<p>Rodney Mckenzie was alone in a cabin in northern Saskatchewan when he woke up and realized something was seriously wrong.</p>
<p>"Everything was foggy," says Mckenzie, recalling the day he began losing his sight five years ago. Luckily it hadn't snowed and he managed to snowmobile home, sticking to the road he'd come up on.</p>
<p>Next, his kidneys failed and another incredible journey began, this one from his home in Stanley Mission south to Saskatoon. He's made the 870-kilometre round trip three times a week for the last two years to receive the dialysis treatment that is keeping him alive.</p>
<p>This summer came another loss, as sores festered on Mckenzie's right foot. Powerful antibiotics couldn't clear the infection. Fearing gangrene would kill him, doctors amputated the lower half of his right leg. "It's been kind of hard adjusting to this," says Mckenzie, 37, his smile cracking as he gestures toward his missing foot.</p>
<p>The grim toll is all thanks to a single insidious disease: Diabetes.</p>
<p>As illnesses go, it is a quiet one, provoking little of the fear inspired by the H1N1 now dominating the headlines. But diabetes is an epidemic and is poised to get much worse. More than two million Canadians have the disease and it is estimated another five million -- 15 per cent of the country's population -- are "pre-diabetic" and an increasing, and worrying, number of them are young adults and children.</p>
<p>By the end of September, 78 Canadians with H1N1, or swine flu, had died.</p>
<p>Diabetes is linked to nearly 40,000 deaths a year in Canada and thousands more people are maimed by the disease, which is overwhelming the meagre medical services in many remote communities. Unchecked, doctors fear the disease will swamp the health-care system.</p>
<p>"I don't think we are remotely prepared," says Dr. Karen Yeates, a kidney specialist at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., who has a growing caseload of diabetics on dialysis treatment, which rings in at $50,000 to $60,000 a year per person.</p>
<p>Detailed Canadian figures are hard to come by, but the financial implications of the epidemic are "enormous," an expert panel reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada earlier this year. It estimated diabetes' medical and economic impact is already costing Canada $17 billion a year.</p>
<p>And the costs are sure to rise, says Dr. Stewart Harris, a leading diabetes researcher at London's University of Western Ontario, as "the tsunami of complications has yet to hit." Serious complications, such as the ones that have Mckenzie trekking to Saskatoon three times a week, tend to occur 10 to 20 years after diagnosis.</p>
<p>Despite growing alarm and dismay in health circles, diabetes gets scant attention compared to diseases such as AIDS or flu, even though it takes a much higher toll.</p>
<p>"I just wish they'd issue weekly reports on diabetes like they do for the swine flu -- how many amputations, how many people going blind, how many kidney failures, how many people dying," says Darlene Arnault, nurse manager at Stanley Mission, where diabetes rates have soared. "What bothers me most is the acceptance of the disease, as if it's normal."</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that there is no microbe to blame for diabetes and no magic pill to cure it.</p>
<p>The disease, which interferes with sugar uptake in the blood, is a slow and insidious killer. It hits the poor and marginalized more often than the affluent and educated. And it tends to sneak up on people as it numbs nerves in the feet, damages retinal cells in the eyes, clogs up the cardiovascular system, cuts circulation and destroys tiny filters in the kidneys.</p>
<p>Mckenzie didn't believe he was even sick.</p>
<p>"I was in denial for a long time," says the former millwright, as he lies in a Saskatoon hospital bed, blood running from a tube in his wrist to a dialysis machine now doing the job of his kidneys.</p>
<p>Sedentary lifestyles and the modern banquet of food laced with sugar and fat are said to be fuelling the explosion of Type 2 diabetes, which is now the most common form of the disease, affecting nine out of 10 Canadian diabetics.</p>
<p>Genetics also plays a role, with people of Asian, Latin American and African ancestry at increased risk. Aboriginal people are even more susceptible, with rates up to five times the Canadian average.</p>
<p>"It's a slow-motion emergency, with aboriginal communities leading the way," says Dr. Jay Wortman, a Metis doctor with Health Canada, which is charting an epidemic that is escalating as Canadians grow older and more obese. The number of Canadians diagnosed as diabetic almost doubled, to close to 2.3 million, in the past decade, and another 200,000 people learn they have the disease each year.</p>
<p>Public health officials and medical specialists like to say Type 2 diabetes is preventable. Their solution sounds simple enough: Eat and exercise in moderation. Just 30 minutes of brisk walking a day and losing five to seven per cent of body weight can cut the risk by more than 50 per cent.</p>
<p>That's easy to say and much harder to do, judging by the soaring obesity and disease rates.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is human nature. People did not evolve in a world where food was served up, often in excess, several times a day, says diabetes specialist Dr. Hertzel Gerstein, at McMaster University in Hamilton.</p>
<p>He notes that over the eons humans had to spend energy to get calories -- by catching, growing and preparing food. Now the opposite is true, with people having to go out of their way to spend energy -- and often money for fitness classes and equipment -- to burn off the calorie-laden foods that beckon from almost every corner.</p>
<p>Westernized society "is constantly pushing the abilities of even highly motivated individuals to cope metabolically," says Gerstein.</p>
<p>One need not look far to see Canadians being encouraged to over-indulge. <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> drive-thrus serve up doughnuts and coffee, with customers expending no more energy than it takes to hand over the money. <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> is busy luring in thirsty consumers with offers of "any drink, any size" for a dollar. And Kentucky Fried Chicken draws a crowd on Toonie Tuesdays: Two pieces of chicken and fries for less than $3.</p>
<p>Doctors also note diabetes can be managed and the worst complications kept at bay if diabetics adopt healthy diets and lifestyles, routinely monitor their blood sugar and take medications as prescribed.</p>
<p>But "self-advocacy" is also critical, and not something that can be prescribed in a bottle.</p>
<p>Mckenzie was 18 when he was diagnosed. He and some friends were fooling around with blood-sugar monitors in a science class and he kept getting high readings. The school nurse sent him off to the local clinic. He was released two weeks later with instructions to check his blood sugar "four times a day, seven days a week." He was also told to avoid pop, eat wholesome food and give up cigarettes.</p>
<p>Nurse Arnault, in Stanley Mission, used to badger Mckenzie to take better care of himself.</p>
<p>"He thought he was invincible," she recalls.</p>
<p>He seemed to be for years as he travelled and worked across Canada, exhibiting few obvious signs of the disease. Then diabetes caught up with Mckenzie, who now lives in Stanley Mission with his father, who is helping him cope with the loss of his sight, his kidneys and his leg.</p>
<p>There are frequent visits from home-care workers and his spirited young nephews, who like to push him around in his new wheelchair.</p>
<p>Three times a week he's up at 5:30 a.m., waiting for the medical van that drives him and other patients to Saskatoon. By noon, he's plugged into a dialysis machine that takes four to five hours to clear toxins and excess fluids from his blood.</p>
<p>In the more than two years Mckenzie has been making the trip, the drivers have always made it despite blizzards and the threat of forest fire.</p>
<p>"It's not like you can really miss dialysis," says Mckenzie, bantering with the nursing staff removing the tubes from his wrist and compressing his arm until the bleeding stops. The medical van usually has him home by midnight.</p>
<p>DIABETES PRIMER</p>
<p>Diabetes interferes with the way the body processes the sugar glucose, the body's main source of energy. When all is going well, cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream after we've eaten and use it as fuel, or pack it away for future use. Insulin, produced by the pancreas, orchestrates the process. With diabetes, the process breaks down, and glucose starts to builds up in the blood.</p>
<p>There are three types of diabetes:</p>
<p>- Type 1, usually diagnosed in children and adolescents, is caused when the body can't produce insulin. The body's immune system or environmental factors are believed to trigger Type 1, which accounts for 10 per cent of diabetes.</p>
<p>- Type 2, which accounts for 90 per cent of diabetes, usually begins when the glucose-absorbing cells lose their ability to mop up sugar and it starts to build up in the blood. Overeating, sedentary lifestyles and an aging population are believed to be fuelling the explosion of Type 2, which affects 250 million people worldwide, up from 30 million in 1985.</p>
<p>- Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy and increases the risk to both the mother and child of developing Type 2.</p>
<p>- "Pre-diabetes" means the body's cells are not responding properly to insulin, and sugar levels in the blood begin to rise. Left unchecked, more than half of people with pre-diabetes develop full-blown diabetes within eight to 10 years.</p>

</p>
<p>The Saskatoon Regional Health Authority took its show on the road Tuesday and held this month's regular meeting in Rosthern.</p>
<p>"We have different issues than the city," said Rosthern Mayor Doug Knoll, who thanked the board members for making the trip to Rosthern.</p>
<p>Before the public portion of its meeting, Knoll and the board members had lunch together. Knoll took the opportunity to pitch an idea that could cut down on the time people spend waiting for surgery.</p>
<p>"We should be doing more elective surgeries here," he said. "We're on a four-lane highway and if somebody in Saskatoon wants to wait two months or get it done tomorrow, they could come out here."</p>
<p>He thinks the board should make better use of the resources in Rosthern, where six physicians work at the 30-bed acute care hospital.</p>
<p>Knoll didn't get a commitment from the board members or the administrators, but "they heard me out," he said.</p>
<p>"I don't know if they've ever had it presented to them before."</p>
<p>Tuesday's meeting was the first public meeting of the 12-member board since June, when the authority met in Watrous.</p>
<p>Board members heard that the Saskatoon Health Region ran a surplus of $344,000 to the end of August, five months into the organization's fiscal year. But before anyone could get too excited about the surplus, health region vice-president Deb Rhodes put the figure in perspective.</p>
<p>"That's about four hours of operation," she told the board members.</p>
<p>"It's very negligible when you look at the big picture."</p>
<p>Saskatoon Health Region's annual operating budget for 2009-10 is $803.6 million.</p>
<p>FLU SUPPLIES A CONCERN</p>
<p>A large portion of the public meeting was spent updating board members on the health region's planning for the anticipated H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>"It honestly changes on the hour," said Sandra Blevins, vice-president of clinical and operations support services.</p>
<p>She is concerned about the availability of supplies needed in the coming months, in particular the supply of needles needed to immunize the 298,371 people living in Saskatoon Health Region.</p>
<p>When the region ordered 700,000 immunization needles, it expected delivery of those needles in time for the seasonal influenza immunization program, which began Tuesday. But in mid-September, the health region was scrambling after its supplier said it was not able to fill the order. The health region has managed to secure from another company a supply of 130,000 needles now, with the remainder expected to be delivered by the end of November.</p>
<p>Blevins urged authority members to not only be diligent themselves, but to tell others of the importance of getting immunized, washing their hands frequently, avoiding people who are ill, coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the crook of their elbow, seeing their doctor if their symptoms are severe and staying home when they are sick.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu season a harbinger of change?</b>

</p>
<p>What a difference a potential flu pandemic makes.</p>
<p>For one thing, hand-washing hasn't been this de rigueur since the 2003 SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>That's as it should be, says eminent American surgeon Dr. Atul Gawande, an advocate of the 90-second "checklist" for ICU surgeons -- similar to the checklist pilots use before takeoff and landing -- which includes thorough hand-washing. He even suggests you ask your doctors if they've washed their hands before examining you.</p>
<p>Like classes across the nation, meanwhile, my son's kindergarten class is learning proper hand-washing techniques. It's a bit like hand-washing for anarchists, mind you, but it's a start -- particularly given the apparent susceptibility of children to H1N1.</p>
<p>And because there have already been several bad colds this season (my son has had two since starting school), members of his class are also being primed on how to blow and wipe their noses and sanitize their hands.</p>
<p>So far at least, they have to stay home only if they have a fever. But a working-mother friend says her daughter's school phones parents to pick up their children when they exhibit even minor symptoms. "I can't keep her home for two weeks if all she has is a runny nose," she complained.</p>
<p>For parents who work, such a call can be a major inconvenience. Who will look after their ill child if, for example, they're representing a client at 10 a.m., or if their shift runs from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m.?</p>
<p>If a child has to leave school, one parent usually has to leave the workplace, which then has to hire a substitute or work short. If such disruption becomes widespread enough, the country's gross productivity could fall.</p>
<p>Apparently, up to 35 per cent of the workforce could be off sick this winter. And since many employees may also have to stay home to care for ill children or elderly family members, health officials recommend that employees establish whether their absence will qualify as paid leave.</p>
<p>In other words, this is about a lot more than a bottle of hand sanitizer on every desk. It's about the role women, in particular, play in society. After all, it's generally they who leave work to pick up a sick child or care for an elderly parent.</p>
<p>Women are encouraged to work. And they generally want to -- indeed, have to. Many families aren't economically viable without two incomes.</p>
<p>But that means most young children have to go to day cares, which are notoriously germy. As one doctor recently said, preschool-aged children these days are "petri dishes on legs."</p>
<p>Sure, there have always been childhood illnesses. But a day-care worker told me she's never seen such virulent colds and flus as in recent years. I don't recall my peers and I being continually sick when I was three, four and five. In fact, I don't remember being sick much at all.</p>
<p>That's partly because -- it has to be said -- more mothers stayed home or worked only part-time. Nowadays, school is like a babysitting catch-all. What with before-school care (from 7:30 a.m.) and after-school care (until as late as 6 p.m.) on top of the regular day, it's little wonder children are exhausted and prone to illness.</p>
<p>I'm lucky: My parents can step in to take care of my son. But I also have to admit I dropped him off at school last week with a runny nose -- although, the week before, at least two other children had colds, which he probably caught from them.</p>
<p>So, what's the answer?</p>
<p>I once told a labour law professor that when I was little (and ill), my mother sometimes called in sick to take care of me. A sign of devotion, he said, but asked: Should parents have to do that? Shouldn't sick days include a child's illness?</p>
<p>I think so. If H1N1 really takes hold this winter, employers will face lost productivity regardless. So, perhaps it's time for the government to legislate family leave -- already provided for in some collective agreements -- at least as a temporary measure.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the social ramifications of closing schools and imposing "no sniffles or coughs" rules have to be seriously considered.</p>
<p>Who knows: H1N1, or a similar pandemic, could change the way society functions -- which might not be such a bad thing.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccinate Olympians first, team doctor says; Elite athletes could put other Canadians at risk: McCormack</b>
</div><div>Linda Nguyen </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>488 words</div><div>14 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>Canadian Olympic athletes should be one of the first in line for the H1N1 vaccine in case there is a swine-flu outbreak during the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver, according to the team's top doctor.</p>
<p>Bob McCormack, chief medical officer for the Canadian Olympic Committee, said Tuesday that, although the policy may seem unfair to other at-risk groups for the flu, including pregnant women, the elderly and aboriginals, the country's elite athletes should be safeguarded from sickness during their time on the international stage.</p>
<p>"They are a group that is at-risk," McCormack said in Vancouver.</p>
<p>"Let's come up with a mechanism so they don't fall through the cracks and get missed completely for the vaccine."</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada has decided not to give the 200 Olympians priority for the vaccine, arguing there's still plenty of time for them to get it before the Games begin in February.</p>
<p>Yet McCormack said the window of opportunity for the athletes to get vaccinated is quickly closing, because most of the group will leave Canada in November for pre-Olympics events, while others face hectic training schedules.</p>
<p>"If they leave in mid-November and don't come back until the end of December or January, they will miss the window for vaccinations and run the risk of getting H1N1," he said.</p>
<p>"And if they bring infections back to Canada, they will put other Canadians at risk."</p>
<p>McCormack said the athletes fit all the criteria of a high-risk group for contracting the swine flu, including their age, exposure to other international athletes, living in close confines and the stress on their immune systems because they "train themselves to exhaustion each day." He said the athletes would not want to jump the line ahead of any other at-risk groups, but should be accommodated.</p>
<p>"We're not talking about vaccinating all of VANOC and our 20,000 volunteers; just the athletes," McCormack said. "This is kind of a microscopic drop in a large bucket." He believes Canadians would want their athletes to be protected from the deadly H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"The example that will make most sense to Canadians is, what if the men's hockey team got swine flu and were unable to achieve their goal of a gold medal? Canadians would be very disappointed," McCormack said. "It would not only be a huge tragedy for the individual athlete who has spent a dozen years of getting to the highest levels of achievement, but, as a country, it would be a serious blow."</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine will be available to all Canadians by the first week of November.</p>

</div><div>ANNE SUTHERLAND </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>570 words</div><div>14 October 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette </div>
</p>
<p>No more shaking hands or sharing the wine and no holy water in church fonts for Roman Catholics, but some of these traditions will continue in Anglican services.</p>
<p>The Catholic Archdiocese of Montreal issued a directive to its priests recently aimed at preventing the spread of the H1N1 virus during flu season.</p>
<p>The Anglican Diocese of Montreal has sent memos on the same subject, but its rules are less stringent.</p>
<p>The Catholic suggestions, which are not hard and fast rules, are based on guidelines issued by the Canadian Public Health Agency, explained Linda Wiltshire, coordinator of liturgy services for the archdiocese. There will be no dire punishment meted out if a church has water in its font, she said.</p>
<p>"There are three reasons we're doing this," Wiltshire explained. "First, there are the guidelines from the health agency; second, we got a letter from the Conference of Catholic bishops; and third, we had heard of concerns coming from the parishioners themselves. It was time to do something together, and these suggestions make sense in terms of what we're seeing out there."</p>
<p>Priests have been advised to empty the holy water from the fonts at church entrances and refrain from greeting people with a handshake as they enter the church. The handshake or embrace that used to be part of the exchange of peace during mass is to be discouraged in favour of a nod or bow.</p>
<p>Any priest who has flu-like symptoms should not participate in the ministry, and communion will be offered in a new fashion.</p>
<p>"We're asking the priests to refrain from sharing the wine cup, to no longer offer the cup," Wiltshire said.</p>
<p>The host, or communion wafer, should no longer be placed on the tongue of the communicant by the priest, according to the new suggestions.</p>
<p>Janet Griffith, archdeacon of the Anglican Diocese of Montreal, explained that the font in an Anglican church is filled with water only for baptisms, so that's not a worry. As for communion, the practice of intinction, or dipping the communion wafer in the chalice, will no longer be allowed, but there will be no ban on drinking from the chalice itself.</p>
<p>"In 2,000 years, no one has gotten sick from the chalice or the wine," Griffith said.</p>
<p>Shaking hands during the ceremony will continue, but the congregation will be asked to use hand sanitizers on entering and exiting the church, Griffith said.</p>
<p>For the past few years, handshakes have been discouraged by some priests celebrating mass at St. Patrick's Basilica downtown during the traditional flu season, but an employee at the church said it was always at people's own discretion whether they shake or not.</p>
<p>One set of directives for all should lessen the confusion, Wiltshire said.</p>
<p>"For older people, used to a certain way of doing things, these directives might be difficult," she said.</p>
<p>For instance, the idea that come hell or high water you must attend church every Sunday. If you're sick, don't go, Wiltshire said.</p>
<p>"We're going for the pastoral approach, the idea of caring for one another. God doesn't want you there if you're sick," she said.</p>
<p>"If you can prevent illness by doing these things, then it's only common sense."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccination program for H1N1 may start early</b>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>The head of the Public Health Agency of Canada yesterday appeared to open the door to an earlier start of the country's H1N1 vaccination program, an effort currently slated to start weeks after those of several other countries.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, who has said in the past he believes in under promising and over delivering, said provinces and territories have been building into their planning the possibility that they may need to start vaccination clinics earlier than the current target of the first week in November.</p>
<p>"We're looking at all the options," he said from Iqaluit, where he and federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq held a town hall meeting aimed at dispelling myths about the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>"Being able to be prepared no matter whenever the authorization comes is important. ... So that's part of the planning and it's been part of the planning all along. So that as soon as the vaccine is authorized, that we're in a position to start to deliver it."</p>
<p>Though polls suggest most of the public is not clamouring for the H1N1 vaccine, the Public Health Agency has been under pressure to speed up approval of the new vaccine, which is being made in Quebec by GlaxoSmithKline.</p>
<p>Opposition MPs have denounced the delay. Ontario's former health minister David Caplan called on the federal government to release the vaccine sooner. And the lateness of the vaccine program launch, at least in comparison to the U.S. program, has drawn criticism in newspaper editorials.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Canadian Medical Association Journal, which has also called for early access to vaccine for people at high risk from this flu, released a modelling study that showed vaccine could have a large dampening impact if it is used early enough to combat a fall wave.</p>
<p>But the study, by researchers at the University of Toronto and the University of Guelph suggests the impact of vaccine could be eroded by delays in its use.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones appeared to suggest Canada doesn't want to start its efforts until provinces and territories are certain they can handle their portion of the single largest vaccination effort in the country's history.</p>
<p>He repeatedly stressed that Canada will have enough vaccine shortly after starting to vaccinate that it will be able to complete the effort within weeks, not the months other countries will require.</p>

</p>
<p>The city shouldn't expect any extra cash from the province to help tackle its predicted $15-million deficit, the general manager of finance said yesterday.</p>
<p>Rob Rossini said the province isn't likely to hand out more than the $16.5 million the city requested to help avoid a property tax increase of more than 2 per cent next year.</p>
<p>"They're facing a significant deficit, as well," he said after yesterday's committee of the whole meeting. "I'll be happy if we get the $16.5 million."</p>
<p>Council struggled to find ways to ease the deficit at yesterday's meeting, discussing whether there are any new sources of revenue to help reduce or eliminate it by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Council received a report that outlined several projected hits to the budget, including an investment of up to $4.4 million in H1N1 immunization clinics, a $3.2-million drop in recycling revenues and an increased demand for social services.</p>
<p>Councillor Brad Clark suggested the city should ask for more money from the province in light of the city's "current financial realities."</p>
<p>The city isn't expecting a response from the province about the funding until early 2010.</p>
<p>Water use went down this summer due to heavy rainfall and, as a result, the city is looking at a new stormwater fee to recoup some of the lost revenue.</p>
<p>The tax would apply to properties, such as parking lots, that don't pay water rates but send runoff into the sewers.</p>
<p>But that plan wouldn't come into effect until late 2010 and wouldn't affect this year's budget, Rossini said.</p>
<p>Staff say the city has been contributing to its reserves for the past four years and has built up about $2.6 million. This year's budget only predicted a $600,000 withdrawal from that source.</p>

</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -- The Vancouver School Board won't be using hand sanitizer to fight the spread of H1N1 flu because school officials are worried students will drink it, squirt it – or even set it on fire.</p>
<p>The alcohol-based, germ-killing gel is considered too risky to be included in the school board's anti-H1N1 arsenal despite being endorsed by the federal government. Instead, the school board will focus its prevention efforts on handwashing.</p>
<p>“With a product being 60 per cent alcohol, it can be ingested. It can be drunk. It can be sprayed in people's eyes. It's also something that can be easily lit on fire,” said school-board spokesman David Weir. “At the end of the day, we look at the fact that this is a product that carries a manufacturer's warning that says keep away from children.”</p>
<p>The B.C. Drug and Poison Information Centre received 200 phone calls about hand-sanitizer ingestion from January, 2007, to December, 2008 – a small proportion of the centre's annual 26,000 reported poisonings. Eighty-five per cent of the hand-sanitizer inquiries concerned children under 12.</p>
<p>Proper use of hand sanitizer is unlikely to cause major toxicity, said Raymond Li, a pharmacist at the centre.</p>
<p>Intentional ingestion of large doses of sanitizer could cause alcohol poisoning, but the centre has not received any calls about adolescent abuse of sanitizer in a school setting, he said.</p>
<p>Health Canada promotes the use of hand sanitizer and advises in its guidelines that sanitizer stations be employed at schools and daycares.</p>
<p>But the department's top recommendation for keeping hands H1N1-free is plain old soap and water.</p>
<p>The school board took these recommendations to its medical health officer at Vancouver Coastal Health and decided to forego the hand sanitizer since its schools have ample washroom facilities.</p>
<p>“We felt that it was best to focus on the preferred method and not to put too many things into the mix and confuse students,” Mr. Weir said.</p>
<p>Teachers in Vancouver schools will be responsible for teaching and modelling proper handwashing, Mr. Weir said.</p>
<p>The move away from hand sanitizers also saves money. Mr. Weir said the estimated costs for adding sanitizer stations were “substantial” and that the school board is already spending $300,000 on H1N1 prevention activities. The money is being used to order more soap, paper towels, disinfectant, facial tissue and printer ink for information packets.</p>
<p>The school board has had mixed reaction from parents, said Mr. Weir. “Parents, when they initially heard and not being fully aware of what went into the decision, had some surprise and concern,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Weir said the school board has explained its rationale to parents and is allowing them to send small bottles of hand sanitizer to school with their children.</p>

<p>HEALTH officials in Manitoba say they're</p>
<p>finalizing H1N1 vaccine plans, and have a</p>
<p>stockpile of ventilators and guidelines for</p>
<p>the public -- the day after a medical journal released</p>
<p>the stark details of who is most likely to</p>
<p>die from the virus.</p>
<p>A Journal of the American</p>
<p>Medical Association (JAMA)</p>
<p>study found the H1N1 death</p>
<p>rate in Mexico was twice as</p>
<p>high as in Canada because of</p>
<p>a lack of access to intensive</p>
<p>care beds and ventilators. Of</p>
<p>those admitted to hospital intensive</p>
<p>care units with H1N1</p>
<p>this spring, 72 per cent were</p>
<p>women, the average age of patients</p>
<p>was 42, 81 per cent needed</p>
<p>to be hooked up to a breathing</p>
<p>machine, or ventilator and</p>
<p>one in six died.</p>
<p>At the height of the H1N1 outbreak</p>
<p>in Manitoba this spring,</p>
<p>there were 38 patients hooked</p>
<p>up to ventilators, according to</p>
<p>the Winnipeg Regional Health</p>
<p>Authority.</p>
<p>Expecting another surge</p>
<p>this fall, Manitoba has nearly</p>
<p>doubled its capacity of 69 adult</p>
<p>ICU beds and nine pediatric ICU beds.</p>
<p>The adult intensive care unit has 129 conventional-</p>
<p>model ventilators plus 11 older machines</p>
<p>that are still usable, as well as two high-frequency</p>
<p>oscillator ventilators that administer shallow,</p>
<p>puffy breaths.</p>
<p>In the pediatric intensive care unit, there are</p>
<p>12 conventional pediatric ventilators for older</p>
<p>children, 31 neonatal ventilators for newborns</p>
<p>and nine older models that can be brought into</p>
<p>use, as well as nine pediatric high-frequency oscillator</p>
<p>models.</p>
<p>Even with enough ventilators, they're useless</p>
<p>without enough nurses to operate and monitor</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>"The issue is the staffing, which is why we had</p>
<p>planned Article 10 -- so we could staff them," said</p>
<p>Heidi Graham, WRHA spokeswoman. Article 10</p>
<p>of the Manitoba Nurses Union agreement gives</p>
<p>hospitals in emergencies or strikes the power to</p>
<p>schedule nurses to work when and where they</p>
<p>are needed.</p>
<p>The hospitals used Article 10 to increase staffing</p>
<p>during the H1N1 outbreak this spring. If</p>
<p>nurses get sick, however, their reduced ranks</p>
<p>could mean fewer available ventilators.</p>
<p>Ninety-three per cent of Manitoba's nurses are</p>
<p>women and their average age is 47 -- fitting the</p>
<p>JAMA study's bill for those who became the sickest.</p>
<p>The news isn't unnerving, say the nurses.</p>
<p>"I don't think they have any more concerns</p>
<p>knowing they're more susceptible,"</p>
<p>said Manitoba Nurses</p>
<p>Union president Sandi Mowat.</p>
<p>"We know how to protect ourselves.</p>
<p>We're always concerned</p>
<p>and we make sure we take all</p>
<p>the proper precautions -- we're</p>
<p>provided with all that equipment,"</p>
<p>said Mowat.</p>
<p>And nurses will be among</p>
<p>the first to get the H1N1 vaccine,</p>
<p>she said.</p>
<p>"We're on the priority list,"</p>
<p>with health-care workers</p>
<p>among the first to receive the</p>
<p>H1N1 vaccine, expected by the</p>
<p>first week of November, she</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>The acting chief provincial</p>
<p>public health officer wouldn't</p>
<p>say who else would be on the</p>
<p>priority list.</p>
<p>"We're developing plans,"</p>
<p>said Dr Bunmi Fatoye. "We</p>
<p>don't have a final priority list. As time is going by</p>
<p>with the H1N1 virus, more research articles are</p>
<p>being released and published," said Fatoye. "Planning</p>
<p>groups review the document -- if there is any</p>
<p>information that is of use or that is relevant."</p>
<p>After Monday's JAMA report, a Canadian Medical</p>
<p>Association Journal study on Tuesday said</p>
<p>the early and rapid rollout of swine flu vaccine</p>
<p>could have a big impact on reducing the number</p>
<p>of cases Canada sees this fall.</p>
<p>It suggests the vaccine could have a disproportionately</p>
<p>large effect on tamping down H1N1 activity,</p>
<p>if it's used early. The impact would be lessened,</p>
<p>though, if the vaccine rollout comes later.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hospital budgets are a headache</b>
</div><div>550 words</div><div>14 October 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>The stresses and strains on Ontario's health care system have now become obvious in a statistical way. They are a real headache. The figures show the difficulty of operating the system in a way that gives Ontarians the quality of medical care they want to receive when they need it.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care has revealed that 61 of Ontario's 159 public hospitals, or 38 per cent, had a deficit in the fiscal year that ended on March 31.</p>
<p>These deficits exist despite the fact that the current Liberal government and the previous Conservative regime routinely increased the Health Ministry's budget, in some cases at the cost of money going to other ministries with worthy projects.</p>
<p>With more than a third of our hospitals having financial problems, the government would, in general, have trouble blaming them or their administrators for their plight. Common sense says the problem is systemic and can't be attributed solely to a widespread inability on the part of many hospitals to live within their budgets.</p>
<p>Interestingly, former health minister David Caplan didn't hesitate to publicly criticize the administration at Cambridge Memorial Hospital for heading for a $5-million deficit this year. He sent in a supervisor to run the hospital because a report indicated a problem with the leadership. "There were a number of outstanding and ongoing governance, management and financial matters at the hospital, things that were identified in the operational review team report, that have not been resolved," Caplan said.</p>
<p>Yes, Cambridge will run a deficit, but, as the ministry's own statistics show, it is in good company.</p>
<p>Of course, as of last week, Caplan is no longer health minister. The ministry's own eHealth Ontario scandal prompted Caplan to submit his resignation to Premier Dalton McGuinty. As health minister, he had little choice but to accept responsibility for the taxpayers' money that the government misspent in an attempt to bring Ontario's medical records into the digital age.</p>
<p>In a report filed recently, auditor general Jim McCarter concluded that Ontarians did not get good value for the $1 billion allotted for this conversion. He criticized the government's management of the eHealth system. "When you get a lack of oversight, you get broken rules," McCarter said.</p>
<p>In response, McGuinty wisely did not dispute the auditor's report but pledged to do better. The premier and the province should use the opportunity presented by the eHealth debacle and the hospital budget problems to launch an intensive review health care in Ontario. The eHealth problems go beyond the financial because this organization was supposed to make health care in Ontario more efficient. Clearly, the solutions were more complicated than the government originally thought. After spending a massive amount of money on electronic records, the government is virtually starting all over again. If nothing else, this crisis should make the new health minister, Deb Matthews, more modest than her predecessor.</p>
<p>Now, how does the new minister plan to help the hospitals cope with the increasing costs of modern medicine at the same time that the population is aging and facing deadly threats such as H1N1? How does she plan to deliver good health care to everyone in such an era?</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Early vaccination is the best way to nip the H1N1 flu season in the bud, a University of Guelph researcher advises.</p>
<p>"The earlier, the better," math and statistics professor Chris Bauch said Tuesday in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health is preparing for a series of H1N1 vaccination clinics in the local health board's coverage area. "We are just finalizing our schedule," spokesperson Jan Craig said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Health authorities across Canada are preparing for a potential fall outbreak that could occur, following an international outbreak last spring that originated in the southern hemisphere and led the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic in the summer. Early indications are the fall season has proved milder, though it's still early.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't say it's too late at this point," Bauch said.</p>
<p>Bauch has been, since the spring epidemic first became apparent in Mexico, working with a team of several other Ontario scientists on the best way to slash potential infection rates in a domestic H1N1 outbreak, using demographic information from the mid-sized Canadian city of London, and existing pandemic H1N1 data. That includes looking at population dynamics, such as the interaction of people in their homes, schools and workplaces and how they would be affected by an outbreak under various conditions, including heath care responses like vaccinations and changes in habits like people avoiding meeting socially.</p>
<p>And while it's not too late for inoculating the public, Bauch would prefer vaccinations sooner, rather than later.</p>
<p>Timely vaccination of the public pays dividends.</p>
<p>Bauch said early intervention translates into a longer time for the flu to reach epidemic proportions and delays an outbreak, the study suggests. Even better, inoculating 60 per cent of the public before an outbreak can largely prevent one.</p>
<p>With less of a threat, there's less opportunity for hospital emergency wards to be overwhelmed with flu victims. Guelph General Hospital isn't taking any chances, having prepared pandemic planning since the summer. In any case, vaccination is always better than no vaccination program in mitigating an epidemic or the threat of one, Bauch concluded.</p>

<p>So Leona Aglukkaq, our federal minister of health, determined there was no departmental "ill will" in its recent sending of body bags to native reserves as part of H1N1 preparedness.</p>
<p>How about this interpretation for the department’s move; it predicts: "no ill will ... survive."</p>
<p>I believe that was the first thoughts government had, and their retraction is not acceptable.</p>

<p>Oh boy. Your throat is sore, you have the sniffles and you're starting to cough. Not only that, you also feel feverish and you're aching all over.</p>
<p>Yes, chances are you have the dreaded swine flu.</p>
<p>So how do you care for yourself and family members who may also come down with the virus? And how do you avoid spreading it to others?</p>
<p>First and foremost, say experts, stay home and take it easy.</p>
<p>"One of the big things we say is give a person time to rest and to rest by themselves," says Dr. Bonnie Henry of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>"When you're fighting off an infection like influenza, your body needs rest to recuperate and help get rid of the infection," she says, adding that anyone who comes down with H1N1 flu should avoid pushing themselves, particularly by exercising.</p>
<p>Dr. Andrew Simor, an infectious disease specialist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, says most adults who come down with swine flu -- or any other flu, for that matter -- won't feel up to doing much except lie in bed anyway.</p>
<p>"Taking it easy, staying at home resting -- especially in the first few days -- drinking lots of fluids, taking (acetaminophen) to ease fever, aches, pains and muscle aches, makes good sense," Simor says.</p>
<p>Lack of appetite can be one of the symptoms of flu, explains Henry, who is a proponent of chicken soup and other soups and broths, which can provide protein and other nutrients the body needs.</p>
<p>"If they're feeling like eating, then they should eat normally, but also make sure they get lots of liquids," she says of people laid low by influenza.</p>
<p>Fever can cause loss of body fluid through perspiration, and that's especially true for children, who need to be kept well hydrated, she says.</p>
<p>"One of the main reasons young children end up in hospital is because they're not taking enough fluids and they get dehydrated," explains Henry.</p>
<p>She recommends giving children juice half-diluted with water to prevent an upset stomach or sports drinks that replace sodium and other electrolytes lost by sweating.</p>
<p>She advises that children under 16 can be treated with kid-sized doses of acetaminophen or ibuprofen, but not ASA because of a link between viral infections and a potentially fatal condition called Reye's syndrome. Decongestants and cough suppressants should not be given to children under age six because they can be harmful.</p>
<p>Both Henry and Simor say that if possible, an adult or child with swine flu should be isolated in a separate room, with one person designated as the caregiver, to prevent the virus spreading to others in the home.</p>
<p>That can be difficult to do, admits Simor. Studies suggest about a third of household contacts on average will develop influenza as a result of exposure to someone who is ill.</p>
<p>A sick adult or child should cough or sneeze into their sleeve or elbow to avoid spraying virus-laden droplets into the air or onto surfaces, "or if they happened to cough into their hand, to immediately wash their hands," he stresses.</p>
<p>"Napkins or tissues should be immediately disposed of into a garbage receptacle rather than just left lying around."</p>
<p>Henry says people are most infectious the first couple of days after developing symptoms (but can pass it to others for about a week), and the worst of the illness typically lasts four days for adults, three days or less for children.</p>

<p>; The Canadian Press</p>
<p>Cold or flu?</p>
<p>The common cold and flu -- both the seasonal flu and the new swine flu -- are caused by different viruses but can have some similar symptoms, making them tough to tell apart.</p>
<p>Here are some telling symptoms of both, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:</p>
<p>COLDS: Usual symptoms include stuffy or runny nose, sore throat and sneezing. Coughs are hacking and productive. It's unusual to have fever, chills, headaches and body aches or, if present, those symptoms will be mild.</p>
<p>FLU: Fever is usually present, along with chills, headache and moderate-to-severe body aches and tiredness. Symptoms can come on rapidly, within three to six hours. Coughs are dry and unproductive, and sore throats are less common.</p>
<p>The Associated Press</p>
<p>Signs a flu patient needs medical care</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says swine flu patients showing these symptoms should seek medical care immediately.</p>
<p>CHILDREN: Fast or troubled breathing; skin turning bluish; not drinking enough fluids; being unusually hard to wake up or not interacting; being so irritable that the child doesn't want to be held, flu-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough; fever with a rash.</p>
<p>ADULTS: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath; pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen; severe or persistent vomiting; sudden dizziness; confusion.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Moms-to-be face hospital screening for H1N1 virus; Pregnant women are one of the groups most at risk of the disease, and they suffer more severe symptoms</b>
</div><div>Amy O'Brian   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>

</p>
<p>All pregnant women arriving at BC Women's Hospital to deliver babies will be screened for the H1N1 virus before they are admitted, according to the hospital's new H1N1 protocol.</p>
<p>Women with flu-like symptoms will be placed in negative-pressure rooms, while staff and visitors in those rooms will be required to wear gowns and masks. Sick spouses and family members will be strongly urged to leave the hospital and see a doctor.</p>
<p>"We have been working quite hard over the past several weeks and did develop a protocol for women presenting at the assessment room," said Pam O'Sullivan, vice-president of acute perinatal care at the hospital. "All women are being screened."</p>
<p>The hospital is taking strict measures because pregnant women in their third trimester are one of the groups most at risk of being affected by the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>They aren't more likely to get the flu, but the effects of the virus are more severe among pregnant women.</p>
<p>As a result, the hospital wants to keep sick patients isolated from healthy patients in an attempt to prevent any spread of the virus.</p>
<p>"We're planning for the worst and hoping for the best," O'Sullivan said Tuesday in a phone interview.</p>
<p>According to the protocol, when a woman in labour arrives at the hospital, she is given a quick three-question survey relating to H1N1 symptoms such as headache, fever, fatigue and aches and pains, O'Sullivan said.</p>
<p>"If anyone indicates that they have any of these, then we start precautionary measures," she said.</p>
<p>The precautionary measures include a nasal swab test for H1N1, followed up by a secondary test, which is sent to provincial labs for analysis.</p>
<p>If the patient is reporting flu-like symptoms, she will be placed in a negative-pressure room, everyone in the room will be required to wear a gown and mask, and they will be asked to follow strict hand-washing guidelines. (A negative-pressure room is one in which air is sucked in -- rather than pushed out -- when a door is opened, and air escapes the room only through a vent to the outdoors.)</p>
<p>The hospital does not have the authority to ban women's spouses or partners due to illness, but if they show up with flu-like symptoms, hospital staff will strongly recommend they do not accompany a patient through labour and delivery. It is recommended ill persons see a doctor to assess whether they might have H1N1 and, if necessary, they should get a prescription for antiviral medication before returning to the hospital.</p>
<p>"We would recommend he go for testing and we would recommend someone else come in [with the patient]," O'Sullivan said.</p>
<p>"It's obviously a bit awkward."</p>
<p>At hospitals in the Fraser Health Authority, there is no screening protocol for pregnant women or any other group of patients, spokesman Roy Thorpe said.</p>
<p>Signs posted throughout hospitals and health units ask patients and visitors to "self-monitor for symptoms."</p>
<p>Visitors are asked to not enter the hospital if they have flu-like symptoms, and patients with symptoms are expected to tell staff upon checking in. But patients are not asked any screening questions upon admittance, Thorpe said.</p>

<p>A bout one million doses of Canada's H1N1 vaccine have already been bottled and are getting ready for rollout while clinical trials are set to begin this week, the country's chief public health officer said Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the federal government's weekly briefing on the pandemic, Dr. David Butler-Jones emphasized there has been no delay in delivering the H1N1 vaccine and it will be ready for large-scale immunization programs the first week of November, if not sooner.</p>
<p>"The first lots have been bottled and are currently being quality tested, packaged and prepared for shipping to the provinces and territories," Butler-Jones said in a teleconference from Iqaluit, where he hosted a public meeting with federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq earlier in the day. The pair is travelling across the country this week to host forums on the pandemic.</p>
<p>Health Canada is reviewing clinical trial data from Europe and is expecting more data to arrive this week that will be critical in the agency's approval process. Clinical trials will also be done in Canada starting this week, but they will be fairly limited in scope, which Butler-Jones said is "normal."</p>
<p>"Canadians are basically a polyglot of people from around the world, so studies in Europe, studies in other parts of the planet are helpful in understanding," he said.</p>
<p>Additional studies will be done on certain Canadian subpopulations, he said, and the surveillance systems that keep track of side effects have been enhanced so that safety data will be gathered after the vaccine is rolled out and closely monitored.</p>

<p>About one million doses of Canada's H1N1 vaccine are getting ready for rollout while clinical trials are set to begin this week, Dr. David Butler-Jones, the country's chief public health officer, said Tuesday, emphasizing there has been no delay in delivering Canada's H1N1 vaccine and that it will be ready for large-scale immunization programs by the first week of November.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Frontline workers need the flu shot</b>
</div><div>386 words</div><div>14 October 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A26</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Strong scientific evidence, backed by simple common sense, dictates that health-care workers should be widely immunized against influenza. Their jobs bring them in close contact with the sick, thereby increasing both the workers' own risk of catching the flu and the likelihood of passing this potentially deadly virus to vulnerable patients.</p>
<p>Influenza vaccine is effective in preventing illness in up to 90 per cent of immunized adults. Accordingly, the province strongly encourages health-care workers to protect themselves with an inoculation, at no cost to themselves.</p>
<p>It is therefore troubling to learn that many of these frontline health-care workers - especially in Toronto's acute care hospitals - are falling short of provincial guidelines on flu vaccination. In fact, staff at several Toronto hospitals have an immunization rate well under that of the population at large. This poses an obvious threat to public health, especially as an H1N1 pandemic stalks the population.</p>
<p>The province wants at least 70 per cent of health-care workers vaccinated annually against the flu. But the median rate for Toronto's acute care hospitals was just 42 per cent last year. That includes relatively good performers, like Toronto Western Hospital, with a 63 per cent coverage rate, and dismal ones such as Scarborough Grace Hospital, where only 24 per cent of health-care workers bothered to get immunized. Ontario's overall influenza vaccination rate for the population over age 12 is 37 per cent.</p>
<p>Toronto Medical Officer of Health Dr. David McKeown lists several possible reasons for the behaviour of health-care staff, including a perception that influenza is a trivial illness, worry about vaccine side-effects, and general apathy. In the end, there is no valid excuse.</p>
<p>McKeown wants Queen's Park to consider making flu shots mandatory for health-care workers if their immunization rates don't significantly improve over the next three years. His proposal deserves backing from Toronto's board of health when it considers the issue next Monday.</p>
<p>Both Premier Dalton McGuinty and Ontario's nurses' association have said taking a flu shot should remain a health-care worker's personal decision. Ideally, that should be the case. But too many have been making the wrong choice when it comes to protecting themselves and their patients.</p>
