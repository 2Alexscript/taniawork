<p>A committee of city councillors should monitor Toronto's response to the swine flu outbreak during the civic workers' strike, says Councillor Brian Ashton.</p>
<p>"I would really urge the mayor to appoint three members of his executive committee to review and monitor our preparedness," he said yesterday. "If there is an absence of resources, correct it. If there are problems with coordination between our various institutions in the city, we need to correct that."</p>
<p>Ashton was responding to concerns of infectious disease specialists that the strike is impeding the city's handling of the H1N1 outbreak, a second and stronger wave of which, they fear, could hit North America as early as September.</p>
<p>Microbiologist Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control for Mount Sinai Hospital, who has consulted all three levels of government on pandemic planning, warned Friday there will be more deaths, hospitalizations and infections as a result of the labour disruption at Toronto Public Health.</p>
<p>But the city's medical officer of health, Dr. David McKeown, maintains that all is under control. "Through the non-union staff who are not on strike at the moment, we have people doing what they should be doing for pandemic planning," he said in an interview Friday.</p>
<p>Almost 2,000 people work for Toronto Public Health, about 10 per cent of whom are not in the union and therefore not on strike. Asked if there will be some "catch-up" work to do after the strike, McKeown said, "Our pandemic planning is continuing, so I would say no."</p>
<p>But Ashton said city officials are sending mixed messages. He sent an email to Mayor David Miller on July 9, asking if the city would be ready for a fall spike in flu cases. A same-day response from spokesman Stuart Green stated: "(Toronto Public Health) has continued its pandemic planning and preparedness although in a reduced capacity during the labour disruption."</p>
<p>Ashton said he's not satisfied: "The mayor was perhaps a little more forthright and less guarded and that gives me cause for concern, because if he says there is reduced capacity, does he feel that's adequate? I don't."</p>
<p>Ontario's pandemic plan calls for public health units to play an important liaison role in case of a viral outbreak. McGeer said they should be declared an essential service so that employees can't go on strike.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Rooting for the old guy; Tom Watson was the last lifeline for ABC's plunging British Open ratings</b>
</div><div>Bruce Dowbiggin </div>

</p>
<p>‘I’m rooting like the devil for the old guy,” Jack Nicklaus told ABC Sunday morning. “Win one for the old guys.</p>
<p>Nicklaus wasn’t the only one rooting for the “old guy.” Fifty-nine-year old Tom Watson was the last lifeline for ABC, which had seen Tiger Woods, the ratings champion, disappear at the cut on Friday – only the second cut missed in a major for Woods. With all respect to Matthew Goggin, Chris Wood, Ross Fisher and Soren Hansen, no one gets up early on a Sunday morning in North America to watch them struggle for the claret jug.</p>
<p>And ABC embraced Watson, spending countless minutes discussing his warm-up routine (he starts with two irons, we were told) while the rest of the field was already on the course. His pal Nicklaus was enlisted, via phone from Florida, to flesh out the unlikely story. Where last year the media went gaga for 53-year-old Greg Norman as the miracle man defying age, an adoring press made Norman seem like a cheeky school boy next to the almost sexagenarian Watson.</p>
<p>In the booth, ABC corralled two of the least congenial figures in the sport – Curtis Strange and Tom Weiskopf – to comment upon their old sparring partner Watson as the five-time British Open winner drilled shot after shot through the snapping breeze of Turnberry. ABC’s Mike Tirico pointedly ignored the obvious question, declining to ask the two former major champions why the heck they had parked their fannies in the booth with him instead of getting down on the course with their peer.</p>
<p>The plain-spoken Strange we know well because of his frequent and acerbic appearances on the PGA Tour broadcasts. His best moment may have been urging Watson’s caddy to hug his man on the 18th and say, “You’ve done this a thousand times, just give me one more.”</p>
<p>The gruff Weiskopf was more unexpected. When Ross Fisher walked off No.?4 after a snowman eight, Weiskopf grunted: “Good chance to get out of here and move on with life.”</p>
<p>But the broadcast would not have missed much otherwise from his terse comments. Tirico was spot-on once more, calling Watson’s missed putt on 18 “a zero-confidence putt.”</p>
<p>As usual when ABC locks on a single figure – Watson supplanting Woods this year – other players and storylines were lost. But as the young bucks fell away, leaving Watson with the tournament in his hands on No.?18, that became a minor quibble. (“It would have been a hell of a story,” Watson lamented after.) Even though Stewart Cink was a great story in finally winning a major, this will be the title Watson lost, not the tournament Cink won. And the network milked it for all it was worth.</p>
<p>Twitter stew</p>
<p>Now that Cink is a major champion, people are wondering about the man. For one thing he’s a Twitter freak. Hours before his date with destiny, he had something other than golf on his mind: “This vending machine at T’berry locker room can meet ANY need that arises. 2nd to last one is condoms.” As the week opened, he thought he might not be healthy enough for his date with destiny: “Pretty sure I have swine flu. I thought if you like BBQ as much as I do, that your antibodies would be built up against it.”</p>
<p>Alliss’s Restaurant?</p>
<p>As always, viewers were left wanting more of Peter Alliss, the BBC’s trenchant wit who pops over to ABC for a few minutes each day. When the cameras caught a dishevelled young Scot in a tam sporting DayGlo hair, Alliss dryly noted, “They’re not all locked up yet. Hope your daughter doesn’t find one.”</p>

<p>Speaking of generation gaps, Ian Poulter raised hackles amongst the conservative cognoscenti of the sport when he sported a Union Jack sweater vest for Round One of the British Open on Thursday. Sniffed Paul Azinger, 2008 U.S. Ryder Cup captain and now TV analyst: “I wonder if he’s a little self-conscious wearing that sweater? I mean, it’s really stepping out, he stands out. He’s such a good player. I wonder if sometimes when he gets to this tournament that he tries too hard to stand out it affects his play.”</p>
<p>Added Ian Baker-Finch, another 40-something type: “A good point.” Maybe so. Poulter shot a revolting 78 in the second round to miss the cut. Then Baker Finch set his sights on the golf ball of Ryo Ishikawa, which features the golfer’s likeness. Anthony Kim has his likeness on his belt buckle, noted the Aussie analyst. “We thought that was bad enough...” C’mon Dad, loosen up.</p>
<p>Lance This?</p>
<p>Has Lance Armstrong become the Tiger Woods of cycling? The controversial American has been away from the Tour de France since 2005, but is making a comeback this year. For the first 10 stages of the 2009 Tour de France, ratings for Versus’ coverage are up 77 per cent through the comparable point last year. That includes an 85-per-cent rise among men 18 to 34 and 132 per cent for men 18 to 49. The 479,800 viewers for the Tour de France tops the 442,300 viewers Versus averaged for the first round of the ’09 Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>

<p>Five major hospitals in Brazil's crime-ridden city of Rio de Janeiro are to be bullet-proofed because of frequent gunfights involving drug gangs, the state news agency Agencia Brasil reported Saturday. The federal hospitals, all located in risky zones, will have concrete walls built around them and steel shutters installed over the windows, some of which will also be reinforced to stop bullets.</p>
<p>China. Visiting students quarantined over swine flu</p>
<p>A group of British students has been quarantined in China after four tested positive for swine flu, officials said Saturday, as Georgia confirmed its first case and Singapore reported a first flu-related death. The four confirmed to have the H1N1 virus have been hospitalized while the remaining 48 students in the group and their teachers are quarantined in a hotel in Beijing. In Singapore, authorities reported its first death linked to swine flu after a 49-year-old man who was diagnosed with the virus died in hospital. Georgia confirmed its first case in a Georgian woman who arrived from London.</p>

</div><div>By Arielle Godbout </div>

</p>
<p>IF you're between the ages of 19 and 59 with an underlying health condition like diabetes or lung disease, you're more likely to end up in the intensive care unit with a severe case of H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>You're also more likely to be among the first to receive the new H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available later this year, said the head of infectious diseases studies at the University of Manitoba.</p>
<p>Dr. Ethan Rubinstein said information about severe flu cases gathered this spring will play a crucial role in deciding who will get the vaccine first in preparation for a second wave of H1N1 that experts say will likely hit this fall or winter.</p>
<p>According to numbers provided by Manitoba Health for the period between April 24 and July 6, a total of 78 patients with suspected or confirmed cases of H1N1 were admitted to intensive care units for a severe respiratory infection.</p>
<p>Sixty-eight per cent of the patients were between the ages of 19 and 59, and 86 per cent had two or more pre-existing health conditions -- the three most common being diabetes, lung disease and smoking.</p>
<p>The province has previously said that obesity and substance abuse can heighten a person's chance of being hit with a severe case of pneumonia related to H1N1.</p>
<p>Slightly more than half the 78 patients were aboriginal and close to two-thirds were women.</p>
<p>The gender ratio in Manitoba is different from the national statistics reported by the Public Health Agency of Canada, which show about the same number of men and women with confirmed cases of H1N1 have needed intensive care.</p>
<p>Rubinstein said aboriginal women of childbearing age, especially those who are pregnant, seem to be particularly vulnerable to the virus, which may explain the higher number of female ICU cases here.</p>
<p>Trying to understand why aboriginal people, and pregnant women in particular, are more susceptible to H1N1 is a "million-dollar question," he said, although poor living conditions have emerged as a major factor for First Nations.</p>
<p>"The major question is whether they're genetically predisposed or not. There's no answer to that yet," Rubinstein explained.</p>
<p>Based on virus surveillance to date, the first people to be vaccinated should be young, pregnant women, he said.</p>
<p>"Second will be people with underlying diseases that make them high-risk," he said. First Nations people who live in remote communities and were not already vaccinated for a pre-existing condition would be next, he added.</p>
<p>Though spread of the virus seems to have tapered off in the last few weeks, Rubinstein said doctors and other experts will be busy preparing for the second wave and keeping their eyes on how the virus develops in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>"It's winter now in the Southern Hemisphere, and this is influenza time there," he said, explaining that a major concern is how the virus will interact with the ordinary seasonal flu. "We'll know a heck of a lot more for the second wave, which will be our winter."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 trend puzzles experts - Virus hitting Manitoba First Nations hardest of any in Canada</b>
</div><div>By Carol Sanders </div>
<div>696 words</div><div>18 July 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>Manitoba First Nations top the list in confirmed H1N1 flu cases among Canadian aboriginal people, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>As of July 15, nearly all the 151 confirmed cases among First Nations and 30 among Métis people were from Manitoba (139 and 29, respectively).</p>
<p>Although census figures show aboriginal people make up only about 14 per cent of Manitoba's population, they have accounted for more than half the province's cases of severe respiratory illness, according numbers released this week by Manitoba Health.</p>
<p>"We're not sure why that is," Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, said during a teleconference Friday. "There are several potential reasons."</p>
<p>Internationally, there are patterns that suggest "something other than the usual risk factors" may be playing a role, said Butler-Jones, who is based in Winnipeg at the public health agency's headquarters.</p>
<p>Dr. Ethan Rubinstein, head of infectious diseases studies at the University of Manitoba, said one possible reason Manitoba First Nations are being hit worse than aboriginals in other provinces could be a genetic predisposition.</p>
<p>The U of M is performing epidemiological studies of many First Nations communities and also testing the cells of aboriginal Manitobans to see their susceptibility and response to the virus.</p>
<p>Rubinstein said he is confident there will be some answers to the mystery before an expected second wave of the virus hits this fall or winter.</p>
<p>In Manitoba, crowded conditions in isolated communities can help spread the H1N1 virus, Butler-Jones said. He noted that many of the hardest-hit First Nations are neighbours. There are also clear risks like chronic disease, severe obesity and smoking, he said.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones couldn't say why cases aren't showing up in neighbouring provinces, where First Nations people also deal with isolation, inadequate housing and chronic diseases like diabetes.</p>
<p>The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs suspects it's because there are more aboriginal people in this province with less access to health care and adequate housing.</p>
<p>"We've always stated Manitoba is unique demographically," Grand Chief Ron Evans said.</p>
<p>The AMC points to Indian and Northern Affairs Canada data that show nearly 60 per cent of Manitoba First Nations fit the definition of remote and isolated -- located at least 90 kilometres from the nearest doctor. The figure is 27 per cent in Saskatchewan and 37 per cent in Ontario. In Manitoba, nearly 40 per cent of reserves are fly-in, compared to 12 per cent in Saskatchewan and 27 per cent in Ontario.</p>
<p>The Manitoba chiefs cite the 2006 census, which shows 14 per cent of Manitoba's population is aboriginal, compared to three per cent in Ontario. Manitoba's aboriginal people are four times more likely to live in crowded conditions than in other provinces. Winnipeg has the largest urban aboriginal population of any city in Canada -- 63,000, and half the aboriginal population is under 25.</p>
<p>It's frustrating for First Nations health care directors trying to get Ottawa to understand the unique situation in Manitoba, Evans said.</p>
<p>"When they're trying to seek additional resources for the region, bureaucrats can't understand why the costs are so high in delivering care and meeting basic needs."</p>
<p>Manitoba's chiefs have rallied corporate sponsors to pay for flu kits for First Nations that include hand sanitizer and masks.</p>
<p>"It's not a good investment," said Butler-Jones. Soap and water are all they really need to prevent the spread of the flu, and the doctor said he wouldn't have his family wear masks at home.</p>
<p>But the head of Canada's Public Health Agency likely isn't sharing his home with 12 people or having to haul water into the house for hand-washing. Evans said with so many First Nations communities dealing with overcrowded homes and no running water, sanitizer and masks are needed.</p>
<p>"People that are so many miles away from where we are... have no understanding of our problem here in Manitoba," Evans said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>COOL irony of livestock trade dispute -</b>
</div><div>By Michael J. Armstrong </div>
<div>688 words</div><div>18 July 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>The American position in the Country of Origin Labelling (COOL) trade dispute is filled with irony. It's even humourous, in a dark way. But COOL is hurting our livestock producers and our economy, and that's not funny.</p>
<p>America's law on COOL governs meat that is processed in the U.S. but is made from foreign livestock. When an American slaughterhouse buys hogs from Manitoba to make pork chops, the package labels on those chops must indicate that the animal came from Canada.</p>
<p>But American meat packers don't want the work of tracking which animals end up in which packages. So they are reducing their purchases of Canadian animals instead. Exports of Canadian cattle to the U.S. are 29 per cent lower so far this year compared to last, while hog exports have dropped 39 per cent. Prices are down, too.</p>
<p>Livestock producers are in trouble across the country. Gerry Ritz, the federal minister of agriculture, acknowledged that point on Wednesday during his visit to Winnipeg. He knows it's not only Ontario manufacturers who are suffering due to "Buy American" policies down south.</p>
<p>COOL is also hurting our depressed economy. Livestock exports to the U.S. were worth $2.2 billion in 2008, but could fall to $1.2 billion this year.</p>
<p>It isn't that our southern neighbours distrust "Canadian" food. Exports to the U.S. of beef and pork meat, rather than live animals, are marginally higher this year compared to last. American consumers seem content to eat the meat. But the processors don't want to package it.</p>
<p>COOL aims to give U.S. consumers the "right to know" where their food comes from. The implication is that shoppers can avoid food illnesses by identifying "risky" foreign sources.</p>
<p>Ironically, it's American sources that have been risky of late. The U.S. has had three national food recalls in less than a month. Virginia cookie dough, Colorado beef, and Minnesota milk power were pulled from the shelves.</p>
<p>Those are on top of earlier recalls of California pistachios and Georgia peanuts. COOL clearly didn't prevent those problems from reaching American consumers.</p>
<p>Most of those recalls also reached us in Canada. That's another irony: We seem to need protection from American food more than they do from our own.</p>
<p>Where food labels could assist with problems is after the fact, by making recalls easier and faster. But COOL doesn't provide enough detail to help there either. The law only requires identification of the country, nothing more specific.</p>
<p>Consider the peanut recall that began last January. Products were still being added to the recall list in June, five months later.</p>
<p>Even the U.S. Department of Agriculture recognizes that COOL is not about safety. Their Food Safety and Inspection Service doesn't run that program. Instead, COOL falls under their Agricultural Marketing Service.</p>
<p>The final irony is that this dispute exists at all, given that Canada and the U.S. co-operate so much in agriculture. We worked with them to promote overseas pork exports after the swine flu outbreak. More recently, the two countries agreed to recognize each other's organic food standards. And yet this dispute persists.</p>
<p>Back in May, Ottawa requested consultations with Washington on COOL's trade impact. Under World Trade Organization rules, this gave them 60 days to negotiate an agreement. That deadline expired on July 6, so Canada is now free to take the issue to a WTO dispute panel.</p>
<p>That's exactly what Ritz and his colleague Stockwell Day, minister of international trade, announced last week in a dispute with Korea over Canadian beef. And the market there is less than a tenth of what COOL is costing us.</p>
<p>So Messrs Day and Ritz, I realize you're busy this summer, but since the American government hasn't changed its policy, you need to act.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hotel industry sees occupancy rates drop</b>
</div><div>Neil Scott </div>
<div>Saskatchewan News Network</div>
<div>474 words</div><div>18 July 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>D1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>
</p>
<p>The recession has taken a bite out of the hotel business in Saskatchewan -- but the provincial occupancy rate is holding up better than elsewhere in Canada.</p>
<p>Hotel occupancy rates in the province were 67.4 per cent in the first five months of the year, down by two per cent compared to the same period last year, says data provided by Tom Mullin, president of the Saskatchewan Hotel and Hospitality Association.</p>
<p>These numbers are better than national numbers that show occupancy rates have dropped to 54.4 per cent in the first five months of the year from 59.7 per cent in the same period last year.</p>
<p>"Saskatchewan is at the top of the heap," Mullin said, adding occupancy rates have held up better in Saskatchewan than anywhere else in the country.</p>
<p>About 70 per cent of the hotel rooms in the province are typically occupied in Saskatchewan, Mullin said.</p>
<p>The strength of the Saskatchewan economy -- and the spending power of Saskatchewan consumers -- have helped buoy occupancy rates, Mullin said.</p>
<p>But the industry has not escaped the effect of the national economic downturn, Mullin conceded.</p>
<p>"I think the real catalyst is the recession and the downturn in business travel," Mullin said.</p>
<p>But a variety of other factors -- such as bad weather, new rules for crossing the U.S.-Canada border and concerns about the H1N1 virus -- have contributed to the troubles in the hotel industry, Mullin said.</p>
<p>Jim Kilkenny, general manager of the Delta Regina hotel, said business has been slow and nine employees were temporarily laid off.</p>
<p>But business has picked up and employees have been recalled, Kilkenny said.</p>
<p>Kilkenny said the economy and other factors contributed to the slowdown.</p>
<p>The fact Canada Day was in the middle of the week this year hurt because it took away a long summer weekend, which can be good for business, Kilkenny said.</p>
<p>The statistics quoted by Mullin, which are based on a national survey, show occupancy rates in the first five months of the year were down in Saskatoon by about one per cent and in Regina by 4.9 per cent.</p>
<p>"We had banner years in both Regina and Saskatoon last year," Mullin said.</p>
<p>Occupancy rates in Saskatchewan hotels outside of Regina and Saskatoon are up so far this year, Mullin added.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada data released Thursday provided more information about why occupancy rates in many Canadian hotels are down.</p>
<p>The statistics indicate travel from the U.S. to Canada dropped by 1.1 per cent in May compared to April.</p>
<p>Travel to Canada from overseas also dropped by 7.8 per cent in May. A 34.6 per cent drop in Japanese travel to Canada was particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Hotel officials say concerns about H1N1 also hurt bus tour businesses.</p>

</p>
<p>Swine flu vaccine could be months away from being ready for approval, U.S. officials said yesterday, further indicating North America may take a more cautious path than some European countries when it comes to speeding these vaccines through the licensing process.</p>
<p>In a week when British authorities suggested pandemic vaccination efforts may begin before the end of next month, U.S. officials said the data needed to approve a pandemic vaccine will take at least a couple of months to generate once clinical trials start.</p>
<p>The first human clinical trial of a swine flu vaccine is expected to start next week, with Australian manufacturer CSL first out of the gate, according to the head of the World Health Organization's vaccine research initiative, Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny.</p>
<p>"We are glad to have CSL having rushed so much to start into trials because we will have results of their vaccine by September," Kieny said in an interview.</p>
<p>She said the Australian company will test two dose sizes - 10 micrograms and 30 micrograms - and will also study whether a protective immune response could be achieved with one dose, or if two would be needed.</p>
<p>The company is not testing vaccine with an adjuvant, a compound that boosts the impact of a flu shot so that smaller shots can be used.</p>
<p>As they build enough vaccine for pilot lots, other manufacturers will follow suit.</p>
<p>Canadian authorities and the country's pandemic vaccine contractor, pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, have not, so far, shared details of the clinical trials that will be conducted.</p>
<p>But the head of the Public Health Agency of Canada, Dr. David Butler-Jones, has repeatedly said the country doesn't expect to roll out a pandemic vaccination program until late October.</p>
<p>He has also said Canada's vaccine will include an adjuvant.</p>

</p>
<p>About two dozen people quietly waited for the noon-hour worship service to begin when the sound of a single cough broke the silence of the grand old sanctuary, echoed through the vaulted ceiling and lingered in the air.</p>
<p>It was just one cough and those who gathered weren't crammed close together in the pews.</p>
<p>So there was probably no harm done -- and church officials want to make sure it stays that way.</p>
<p>Twice during the mass at St. Louis Roman Catholic Church in Waterloo on Tuesday, Rev. Tim Uniac made special announcements advising people of new precautions issued by the diocese's bishop last week.</p>
<p>As the pandemic H1N1 flu virus spreads around the world, local church leaders in different denominations are modifying their rituals to minimize the spread of the potentially-deadly virus.</p>
<p>So Uniac announced that while sharing the customary sign of the peace during mass, parishioners should refrain from shaking hands with their neighbours.</p>
<p>He also informed the assembly he would be distributing the communion host only in the receiver's hand -- not on the tongue as some prefer.</p>
<p>"It's a good idea to be proactive," Uniac said in a brief interview before the mass.</p>
<p>While long-standing religious practices are sacred to many people, worshippers at Tuesday's mass seemed to be comfortable with the new measures.</p>
<p>"I think it's a good idea," said Dan Wycoco after the mass.</p>
<p>A lifelong Roman Catholic, Wycoco said he usually receives the communion wafer on his tongue. Receiving the host in his hands this week felt a bit strange, he said.</p>
<p>"But if you think it's for the better good of everyone, I have no problem following it," he added.</p>
<p>The bishops of Anglican Church of Canada and Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada parishes issued pastoral letters on April 30.</p>
<p>(See the story at right for the bishops' recommendations.)</p>
<p>The World Health Organization declared the H1N1 flu a pandemic in June. As of yesterday, there were 49 flu-related deaths and more than 10,100 illnesses across Canada.</p>
<p>In Waterloo Region, there have been no flu-related deaths reported so far.</p>
<p>But there have been 32 lab-confirmed cases, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, the region's associate medical officer of health, said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Six people with the flu have been hospitalized, but two of them were hospitalized for unrelated reasons, she said.</p>
<p>So far, the H1N1 flu virus is behaving the way the flu virus behaves each year, Wang said. But the particular strain of H1N1 had not been seen before, and public-health officials are being vigilant in monitoring its effects, she added.</p>
<p>Despite the extra precautions recommended by local bishops, regional health officials are not asking groups to implement anything more than in any regular flu season, Wang said.</p>
<p>The region is recommending people wash their hands regularly, to cough into a tissue or the crook of their elbow and for those who are ill to stay home. Wang is also recommending regular cleaning of surfaces touched by many people.</p>
<p>In their pandemic planning since 2005, local public-health and social-services officials have included the faith community among the many groups they've approached for help in the event of a severe pandemic.</p>
<p>"It was recognized that while public health has a significant role in an influenza pandemic, it's an event that requires input and support and response and planning from a . . . cross-section of communities," said Chris Harold, a supervisor in the region's public-health unit.</p>
<p>In the event of a widespread severe pandemic, faith groups can help provide emotional support. In severe cases, public-health officials have the authority to prohibit large gatherings.</p>
<p>But the region would be reluctant to order an end to religious services because many people find them important for emotional and spiritual support, Harold said.</p>
<p>"We'd be probably a little more hesitant to suspend those," he said. "But ultimately, nothing's impossible."</p>
<p>If the need arises, officials might recommend the end of some church activities such as Sunday school or youth group meetings.</p>
<p>Churches have been more actively preparing to prevent the spread of disease in their congregations since the deadly outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003.</p>
<p>As a precaution, churches suspended sharing communion chalice.</p>
<p>At the time, Dr. Richard Mathias, professor of public health at the University of British Columbia, wasn't worried that people would catch SARS from sharing the communion chalice.</p>
<p>But this time it's different.</p>
<p>Influenza is much easier to catch than SARS, Mathias said this week.</p>
<p>"It's probably safer to . . . not use a common cup," he said.</p>
<p>Shaking hands should be safe, Mathias said, if people use hand sanitizers on their way into church and cough into their sleeves rather than in their hands.</p>
<p>The flu virus is transmitted from person to person, through the spread of droplets of mucous from coughing and sneezing.</p>
<p>If you're starting to cough -- even before experiencing chills and fever, the telltale signs of a flu -- don't go into group, Mathias said.</p>
<p>An important part of a church's mission is to visit people who are ill or elderly.</p>
<p>But if the patient is sick with the flu, then the pastor, church staff or volunteer conducting the visit needs to be protected from the virus by a surgical mask.</p>
<p>"It doesn't have to be a fancy N95 mask," Mathias said. "Just a good surgical mask put on just before the exposure and then taken off and disposed of after."</p>
<p>Shaking hands is not part of the ritual or culture at Shri Ram Dham Hindu temple in Kitchener, said Chaitanya Jyoti, the senior swami at the temple.</p>
<p>When people greet each other, they place their palms together, as in prayer, and greet each other with words and a slight bow.</p>
<p>"Our tradition goes like that," she said. "We never shake hands. We fold our hands and greet them."</p>
<p>For Muslims, the most well-attended prayers of the week are on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Akhtar Malik, chair of the Islamic Centre of Cambridge, said the administration had planned to make an announcement that anyone feeling unwell should stay home or, if they plan to attend prayers, to go to the office where they will be given a mask to wear while in the mosque.</p>
<p>"We have masks already," he said.</p>
<p>Muslims typically stand shoulder-to-shoulder when they pray in a group, but shaking hands isn't part of the ritual.</p>
<p>"It's not a must," Malik said. "It's up to the people if they want to shake hands."</p>
<p>Parish nurses in about 10 local congregations have been working on pandemic awareness since 2006, said Anne Marie Webster, parish nurse at St. Louis in Waterloo.</p>
<p>The nurses, serving different denominations, have shared information, conducted education sessions and provided notices in parish bulletins.</p>
<p>People today are already inundated with information, Webster conceded.</p>
<p>"I think that's why we, as parish nurses, just give little snippets at a time," she said. "We don't want to panic people. We just want to keep them healthy and we want to just raise their awareness . . . We don't want to overwhelm."</p>
<p>Rev. Christopher Pratt, rector of St. John the Evangelist (Anglican) Church in downtown Kitchener, said he reminds parishioners to not shake hands during the sharing the peace.</p>
<p>The congregation has also stopped practising intinction, the method of receiving communion by dipping the bread in the sacramental wine. But the congregation has not stopped sharing the communion chalice, he said.</p>
<p>Pratt served on a pandemic planning subcommittee organized by the region.</p>
<p>One concern for faith communities, he said, is to devise ways to worship, to build community and a healthy support system in the event of a severe pandemic if gatherings are curtailed by public-health authorities.</p>
<p>"Each particular community of faith is going to have to handle it in a way which is respectful to their tradition, meaningful to people who look to communities of faith for spiritual support," he said.</p>

<p>Bishops' recommendations to local churches:</p>
<p>Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamilton:</p>
<p>Refrain from shaking hands during the sharing the peace.</p>
<p>Communion should be distributed only in the hand, not on the tongue.</p>
<p>Communion should not be distributed by the chalice.</p>
<p>Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should be available for parishioners.</p>
<p>Parishioners experiencing fever, worsening cough, chills and fatigue should see their doctor and refrain from attending mass.</p>
<p>The obligation to attend mass applies to healthy parishioners, Most Rev. Gerard Bergie, auxiliary bishop for the Diocese of Hamilton, said in an interview this week.</p>
<p>"If you're not well, there's no obligation precisely because you can then spread the flu or whatever bug may be around," Bergie said.</p>
<p>From the Eastern Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada's website www.easternsynod.org[http://www.easternsynod.org]:</p>
<p>Clergy and parishioners who are suffering from influenza, or are living with anyone with the flu, must refrain from attending worship.</p>
<p>Everyone entering the church must use hand sanitizers placed at church entrances.</p>
<p>"The practice of intinction -- dipping the bread into the wine -- is not acceptable as it increases the risk of contamination."</p>
<p>Pastors should develop alternate ways for parishioners to greet each other if physical contact is prohibited by public-health authorities.</p>
<p>From Rt. Rev. Robert Bennett, the Anglican Church of Canada's Diocese of Huron website www.diohuron.org[http://www.diohuron.org]:</p>
<p>Those helping prepare holy communion should pay attention to hand washing and use hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>Regular cleaning of railings and door knobs is recommended.</p>
<p>"We have determined that it is not necessary at this time to withhold the use of the common cup, but we strongly discourage the use of intinction in all situations." In the Anglican tradition, it's appropriate to receive communion by taking only one of the elements.</p>
<p>Refrain from shaking hands with pastors and ushers. The pastor and congregation exchange a verbal greeting of peace during the service.</p>

<p>Health authorities saw indications this week that the swine flu is finally entering the summer recess that was expected, as the number of Canadians treated for flu symptoms dipped, but they are cautioning not to be complacent because the virus is still circulating.</p>
<p>"This week we have seen a decrease in the rates of people seeking medical care for flu-like symptoms, suggesting that community transmission is decreasing and most people affected by the flu are recovering at home without treatment," federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Friday at a news conference to provide an update on the pandemic.</p>
<p>While the majority of cases are mild, the health minister said there are still "pockets of more severe illness" in some communities. The latest numbers indicate that 10,156 people have been diagnosed with swine flu, also known as the H1N1 virus, and 1,115 people required hospitalization. There was a 21 per cent increase in the reported number of hospitalizations this week, but Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said that spike could be due to delayed reporting to federal officials from the provinces and territories.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying we're over this yet," Butler-Jones said. "But the general indication, the feeling in general, is that we are seeing less than we were, but that doesn't mean we're not seeing new cases and that doesn't mean it will continue to decline for sure."</p>
<p>Influenza viruses are "full of surprises," said Butler-Jones, who would not tie himself to a prediction of how much worse the pandemic will get when the regular flu season begins in the fall.</p>
<p>"We don't know when it will return, we don't know if it will actually ever completely go away," he said. "We're still seeing new cases. It appears that there are fewer, it appears that we are seeing fewer people admitted to hospital so it seems to be on the wane, but we're still seeing cases so nobody should let down their guard."</p>
<p>This past week several clusters of swine flu were detected at summer camps in Ontario, causing concern and confusion among parents about what to do with their camp-bound children this summer. Camps have been advised to tell campers who have had flu symptoms within seven days prior to their start date to stay home and for camps to step up their screening for symptoms among campers.</p>
<p>The health minister said a guidance document has been posted on the public health agency's website related to swine flu and summer camps, and that Canadians can expect an expanded public-awareness campaign in the fall to keep them informed about the virus.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said Canada remains on track in its development of a vaccine for the swine flu, which is a new strain of the influenza virus.</p>
<p>"We expect that the H1N1 vaccine will be made available by late October, early November and everyone who needs the vaccine will be able to get at least one dose before Christmas," she said.</p>

<p>In high school I had a friend named George who was always washing his hands. His father was a North Toronto surgeon who taught him all about germs and hygiene. George, not over-obedient in other ways, took the lesson to heart. While the rest of us ran our hands under the washroom tap for a few seconds, if that, he stood there for minutes at a time, lathering up to the wrists and rubbing between his fingers like a regular Lady Macbeth. “You're a strange one, pal,” I used to think. But it turns out that George was way ahead of his time.</p>
<p>As the world copes with its first pandemic since 1968, health authorities are united about the best way to control the spread of the H1N1 virus: Folks, wash your hands. In its website on the flu, the Public Health Agency of Canada is almost evangelical when it reports that “Handwashing is easy to learn, cheap and incredibly effective at stopping the spread of disease-causing germs.”</p>
<p>With H1N1 continuing to spread in Canada – 10,156 laboratory-confirmed cases of it so far, with 1,115 hospitalizations and 45 deaths as of July 15 – our first reaction is to demand: What is the government doing? After news this week that 10 Ontario summer camps had suffered outbreaks of the disease, new alarms were raised about the safety of camps, daycares and schools – all the places where young people, apparently more vulnerable to this flu than its predecessors, might be at risk.</p>
<p>We rebel at the idea that something as simple as cleaning under our fingernails might be the best way to avoid a world-girdling sickness.</p>
<p>But with a fast-spreading, fast-changing illness, there are limits to what the authorities can do. When I asked Toronto schools officials about their plans, they said they were watching and waiting to see how the flu develops when classes resume in the fall. They have a detailed pandemic response plan and an open line to Toronto public health officials, but apart from cleaning doorknobs and washrooms taps, there is no way they can stop the spread of this clever virus.</p>
<p>A vaccine is on the way, but it may not be ready until late this year. Halting a virus that has spread so generally through the community – hand to hand, mouth to mouth – is hard unless you close every school, daycare, camp and workplace, cancel all public events and tell everyone to stay home – a crushing step in the midst of a recession, as Mexico found. In any case, most people getting the bug have been suffering only mild symptoms. The majority recover within a week without medical treatment. All of the camp cases reported this week were mild and no one required hospital care.</p>
<p>In a bulletin this week, the World Health Organization said that it no longer makes sense to pour resources into detection, investigation and laboratory confirmation of swine-flu cases. In Toronto, health authorities have stopped telling schools about every case they find among schoolchildren. They are not generally testing to confirm that it's H1N1, either. Doctors were finding that by the time they got test results back, the patient was better.</p>
<p>Most authorities don't recommend closing schools or camps when children start getting sick. Kids could just as easily spread the disease by hanging out at the mall if school were closed. Now that the disease is present in the general community, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that school closures are not usually effective. The best control programs, it reports, “focus on early identification of ill students and staff, staying home when ill, and good cough- and hand-hygiene etiquette.”</p>
<p>In short, washing your hands. Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, says that “the message of prevention is critical, at school, camp, daycare, home or at work. That means washing hands, coughing or sneezing into your arm and avoiding others when we're ill. Not just today, not just for this outbreak, but always.”</p>
<p>The Toronto District School Board has put hand-washing instructions on washroom mirrors and a how-to video on its website. At the Catholic board, too, “hand-washing continues to be the major message,” says health and safety chief Corrado Maltese. The board is putting in some hand-sanitizing stations, but “we still rely on good old soap and water.”</p>
<p>Hands spread 80 per cent of infectious diseases such as colds and the flu, but “disease-causing germs slide off easily with good hand-washing technique,” says the Public Health Agency. It's not just officials who should be acting, says the agency. Preventing the flu “is everyone's responsibility.” For once, that cliché rings true.</p>
<p>George was right. Don't just wring your hands about H1N1. Wash them.</p>

<p>When Pastor Perry Chernesky stepped into the pulpit at the Oakbank Baptist Church on Father's Day, he was not himself. He felt lousy, coughing with aching bones. Practising with the worship band before service, he was noticeably quiet, plucking at his bass guitar, not ripping off his usual self-deprecating one-liners.</p>
<p>He apologized wryly that morning to his congregation in the small bedroom community just east of Winnipeg: “I am not feeling very well, so I hope this make sense.”</p>
<p>But people went home thinking it was one his most tender, thoughtful sermons. “In the top five,” one parishioner declared.</p>
<p>He told them how his family had gotten in the habit of saying “I love you” every time they parted. He spoke especially to the fathers in the pews, offering a message that would later seem prophetic: “Tell the ones you love,” he urged, “that you love them. Because you just never know.”</p>
<p>Mr. Chernesky's wife, Claudia, and their two daughters, Abigail and Deborah, were at home, sleeping off coughs off their own. But ministers, by the nature of their work, pick up a lot of bugs; Mr. Chernesky couldn't skip worship over a rotten cold. It was bad enough that he had begged off the reception for a wedding he'd performed the day before, where he'd been expected to say grace.</p>
<p>Ms. Chernesky had already booked a doctor's appointment for him for the next day – the cough reminded her of his bout with pneumonia shortly after Abigail was born in 2002. For all the headlines it was making, swine flu didn't cross their minds.</p>
<p>Mr. Chernesky was counting the sermons to vacation: One more weekend, and they were taking a break from small-town life in Oakbank, to visit family in Edmonton. Today, though, he'd been promised a nap in the afternoon, and then Claudia was going to sit through the new Star Trek movie for the second time – the best kind of Father's Day present for a 42-year-old man of God who still had his old Starfleet Communicator at home and considered James T. Kirk a childhood hero. He just needed a rest first.</p>
<p>But he never made it to see Star Trek again. In fact, Pastor Perry Chernesky's Father's Day sermon, with its warning about life's uncertainty, would be the last one he preached. On Sunday morning two weeks later, his heart gave out in intensive care at a Winnipeg hospital. He was your average, seemingly healthy middle-aged dad, aside from some extra pounds on his 6'1” frame and knees getting too creaky to carry him though hockey games. Yet he died from a flu that blows through most people like a bad wind.</p>
<p>He was the 32nd Canadian to die with the H1N1 virus in his blood, but his was one of only a handful of cases where doctors could not easily point to another contributing factor such as congestive heart disease or diabetes or asthma.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, a 25-year-old Calgary mother of four died with the virus after being initially sent home from the hospital with inhalers and told she had a bad cold; Vanessa Bluebell fell into a group that appears hardest hit by H1N1 – young, healthy and aboriginal. And while it may turn out in the long run that there was some hidden weakness that made each of these people unable to fight it off, for now these cases are one of the mysteries of the virus.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the number of deaths in Canada connected to the H1N1 pandemic had risen to 45, still a tiny percentage of the people who get the flu. Most shake it off after a few days. Since hospitals have stopped testing everyone – the World Health Organization advised countries yesterday to stop spending limited resources tracking the illness – most people cannot even be certain they had it.</p>
<p>But, as doctors and hospital brace for H1N1 to return in force this fall, and drug companies race to churn out a vaccine, researchers concede this virus is different: Unlike the regular flu, it makes some otherwise-healthy people very sick. And sometimes, it doesn't let them go.</p>
<p>Finding his calling</p>
<p>Perry Chernesky didn't always want to be a pastor. He was raised in Edmonton by parents, Richard and Mary, who believed in God but didn't attend church. His father worked for the gas company by day and played the guitar in a country western band at night. His mom was a dental technician. Perry took after his dad in his passion for music, learning the guitar mostly on his own, and when he got his licence, he'd take his little sister, Terri-Jane, driving with the sunroof open and the Beatles blasting on the radio.</p>
<p>In 1986 he went off to the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology to study chemistry. At school, he met a pretty 18-year-old named Claudia Lodwig, but she refused to go out with him because he wasn't a practising Christian. He didn't know much about God, he confessed. “But would you date me if I came to church?” he asked. Claudia, who liked his goofy sense of humour, agreed.</p>
<p>They were married after graduation, on Canada Day, 1989 (Perry joked that he chose the date to make sure he never forgot their anniversary). Deborah was born in 1995; Abigail arrived seven years later.</p>
<p>For a while, Perry took a job selling medical equipment. Then, for two short months, he tried to sell cars, Claudia recalls, but he was just nice to force a sale.</p>
<p>“You had to be so competitive and cutthroat,” she says, “and he's not like that. He had a big heart and he just couldn't do it.”</p>
<p>But faith had become a major part of his life, and the people he met at church began to see a different line of work for him, a better match to his generous, outgoing personality and his desire to help people not badger them into buying cars. In 2002, after an undergraduate degree at Concordia University and a master of divinity at Edmonton Baptist Seminary, he took his first position as an associate pastor at a local church.</p>
<p>“He gathered the kids around him,” says Claudia. “At first, they'd think, ‘Oh, here's this great big geeky guy.' But then afterwards he was just Pastor Perry and all the kids loved him.”</p>
<p>The move to the small town of Oakbank four years ago was his first call as head pastor. He became known for quoting Bugs Bunny in sermons, and playing Dire Straits on his guitar. He played defence on his men's-league hockey team, though this year he missed nights because his knees were bothering him. To his girls, he was their crazy father who would chase them around the house with a pair of fly swatters pretending to be the Star Wars villain Count Dooku, or would play long bouts of Mario Kart on their PlayStation.</p>
<p>Whenever he went away, and sometimes for no reason at all, he would buy the three of them extravagant gifts – a leather jacket for Claudia, a top-of-the line guitar for Deborah, the budding musician.</p>
<p>“I'd tell him, ‘We can't afford this,' ” says Claudia, who works for a pharmaceutical company in Oakbank. “But he couldn't help himself. How do you say no to gifts like that?”</p>
<p>On their own, the couple liked to hike or try out new restaurants.</p>
<p>Claudia remembers sitting in the pew at that last wedding he officiated. He was going to the doctor Monday no matter what, she'd decided. She knew he was struggling to get through the ceremony, reminding the groom – in that warm, twinkling way of his – to love his wife as if she were the centre of his world.</p>
<p>“He was that kind of man to me,” she said this week. “He was my best friend, he truly was.”</p>
<p>With their own 20th wedding anniversary just a few weeks away, they planned to have dinner with friends in Edmonton. But by Canada Day, Perry lay in a coma while his body fought back against the flu. At his bedside in intensive care, wearing a gown, mask and gloves, all Claudia could do was hold his hand and gently brush his hair.</p>
<p>His anniversary card, full of loving sentiment, was waiting in its envelope at home, for when he woke up.</p>
<p>Broken intimacy</p>
<p>After church on Father's Day, Perry had gone home for his nap, but Claudia found him sitting up in a chair, unable to sleep.</p>
<p>“Why aren't you in bed?” she asked him worriedly.</p>
<p>“I hurt too much,” he told her. “I just ache all over.”</p>
<p>This isn't good, she thought to herself, driving him to the emergency room at Winnipeg's Concordia Hospital. He was admitted almost immediately, and placed in isolation, standard practice for people who reporting respiratory symptoms. A sample of his blood was sent away to be tested for the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>When she tried to sit with him on the bed, he shook his head: he couldn't wiggle over to make room for her. “Sorry, Claud, you can't,” he said. ‘I just hurt too much.”</p>
<p>“Already then the illness was splitting us,” Claudia recalls. “The intimacy was broken.”</p>
<p>Even being on a ventilator didn't help, and by Tuesday his doctors had rushed through his lab work to confirm his diagnosis: He had H1N1, but they had no idea where he'd picked it up. Other than their coughs, Claudia and the girls didn't get sick, and no one they knew had the virus.</p>
<p>It was decided to move him to the Health Services Centre, Winnipeg's largest hospital, and induce a coma to help his body fight the infection. Standard treatment, the doctors said, just for three or four days. Perry and Claudia never doubted them. They said goodbye to each other, believing it was just temporary, but making sure to say “I love you.”</p>
<p>But in the coma his condition only worsened. His kidneys began to fail and he was put on dialysis, but even that didn't seem to be helping. Every time doctors would get him stabilized, something else went wrong.</p>
<p>For Claudia, sitting for hours beside her still, silent husband each day, time moved slowly. She was warned not jostle or make too much noise around him – the doctors said he needed all his strength to keep fighting. “Every step he went lower and deeper into trouble,” she says, “the less we could touch him.” Even when she did caress him with a gloved hand, he didn't respond. “He was as cold as a cucumber.”</p>
<p>Still, his doctors were optimistic: “He's stable,” they'd tell her, “go home.” She needed to pace herself because he'd be in the hospital for weeks. She had the girls to consider, though Perry's parents had come to help out. The medical team looking after him, she thought, was top notch – so busy, but always with time for her. Later, even grieving, she would say, “When the chips are down, the system works.”</p>
<p>At the church, the congregation held special prayer sessions and delivered meals, and they pondered the uncanny timing of that Father's Day sermon. “It was almost prophetic, we've used that word,” says Howard Bredin, the music director. “Like he knew he wasn't going to be there here much longer. Something led him in that direction.”</p>
<p>On Friday, July 3, doctors recommended that out-of-town family should come quickly. Perry's sister, Terri-Jane, flew in from Edmonton. Until then, she says, “We'd all been told baby steps, that nobody his age had died from this.”</p>
<p>Claudia decided to let Deborah visit her dad, but chose to keep Abigail at home. “She's only 7,” she says. “I thought it would be too much for her.” They were still hoping, praying, for a different ending.</p>
<p>“On the very last day,” Claudia says, “all I could do was hold his hand and squeeze it.” She has to believe he knew she was there.</p>
<p>On Sunday at around 6 a.m, the phone rang: Perry was gone.</p>
<p>Later, word spread among the congregation that some residents in Oakbank had gone to their doctor the week before with minor flu symptoms. But of all the people Pastor Perry saw that weekend at the wedding and at church, Claudia hasn't heard of anyone even getting a cough they found worth mentioning.</p>
<p>United in love</p>
<p>This Monday, on what would have been Perry's 43rd birthday, Claudia and his family will place his ashes in a niche at an Edmonton ceremony – a quiet, private ceremony that follows a large funeral for him in Oakbank and another in Edmonton. The inscription will read “United in Love,” with the date of their wedding and a cross.</p>
<p>“The Lord gave him 42 years and 11 months,” Claudia says. “I just wish he could have been with us longer. But I had 20 good years of marriage. You don't complain about that.”</p>
<p>Quiet Deborah is struggling the most with her dad's death. Next month, following in his musical footsteps, she heads to a prestigious band camp on a scholarship. Abigail still asks Claudia about heaven, and what her father might be doing up there, but seems to accept her mom's careful answers.</p>
<p>Claudia, leaning heavily on her family and her faith, is trying to figure out her next step. She expects, for now at least, to return to Oakbank.</p>
<p>“You accept what God gives you,” she says. “Life is a privilege. It's not something you have a right to. You can't say, ‘I deserve this, or this wasn't right.' Life is life. Everybody has bad things they go through.”</p>
<p>She wants people to understand that her husband was the rare, random case: Most patients with H1N1 get better. She and the girls might have had it, and their most serious symptom was coughing. The last thing she wants is for the pastor's story to make people hide from life for fear of the flu.</p>
<p>“My brother didn't hide from anything,” Terri-Jane agrees. “He lived his life the way he wanted to.”</p>
<p>“I don't want people to panic about it,” Claudia says. “And the health-care system is … really looking out for people.”</p>
<p>She sounds strong. Her voice cracks only once or twice while sharing her memories. “So far, today is okay,” she says. “Tomorrow might not be.”</p>
<p>In Oakbank, they won't soon forget their pastor's last words from the pulpit, reminding them of the same lesson.</p>

<p>Dave Cobb has his Games face on. Screwed on tight. Executive vice-president and deputy chief executive with Vancouver's 2010 Olympic Winter Games Organizing Committee (VANOC), he's the main numbers man, responsible for delivering six months from now a break-even mega-party.</p>
<p>Can he manage? His expression doesn't change.</p>
<p>Yes, he says, he can.</p>
<p>We hope. Like it or not, we are all invested parties. Whether by circumstance or choice, taxpayers and private sponsors have bet that an extravagant, international entertainment event will bring significant returns to Vancouver, to British Columbia, to Canadians.</p>
<p>Before the world economy soured, the odds at breaking even looked pretty good. Money flowed into VANOC coffers; relatively little was handed out. The committee's budget projections seemed about right. The Games' books could balance.</p>
<p>Corporations bought in -- in a big way. Leading the pack was Bell Canada, wholly owned by BCE Inc.</p>
<p>In late 2004, when times were good, Bell committed a staggering $200-million to the Vancouver's 2010 Games, plus sponsorship rights to Turin in 2006, Beijing in 2008, and London in 2012. The deal included $90-million in cold, hard cash.</p>
<p>Bell also teamed with Rogers Communications Inc. to acquire broadcast rights to both the 2010 Winter Games and the 2012 Summer Games. The consortium paid a record $153-million for these rights.</p>
<p>The rest of Bell's commitment was described in terms of services, such as the installation of 285 kilometres of fibre-optic cable between Vancouver and Whistler, B. C., and a new wireless link between the two centres.</p>
<p>VANOC's good fortune continued. In 2005, it secured still more lucrative sponsorship deals: A $110-million pledge from RBC Financial Group, which includes $70-million in cash and the rest in services; $62.5-million from Petro-Canada, including $18-million in cash; $53-million from General Motors of Canada, which includes $14-million in cash; $100-million worth of goods and services from Hudson's Bay Co.; and cash and services worth $68-million from home improvement chain Rona Inc.</p>
<p>Then came the global economic meltdown. None of the 2010 sponsors has reneged, not even bankrupt GM. But some of the agreements now look profligate. Some analysts say expected returns to the company -- advertising dollars especially-- will have to be adjusted downward, perhaps severely.</p>
<p>Even small deals are hard to come by, now.</p>
<p>This week, after months of inactivity on the sponsorship front, VANOC announced it had signed up ALDA Pharmaceuticals Corp. The New Westminster, B. C., company will supply the Games with hand sanitizer and disinfectant cleaning products.</p>
<p>"These are products for the times we are in," offered John Furlong, VANOC's CEO. "Infection control" had to be introduced for the Games to avoid disruption from H1N1 and Norwalk viruses.</p>
<p>VANOC is still looking for sponsors and suppliers to round out its roster.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, expenditures are rising. According to VANOC officials, some companies have declined to bid for Olympics-related work; this has meant contracts are being awarded without a competitive process, driving up VANOC's costs.</p>
<p>Mr. Cobb has tweaked his forecasts. His operating budget, now $1.76-billion, is up 7% from 2007, and has increased significantly from the original $1.3-billion six years ago, when Vancouver made its winning Games bid.</p>
<p>The $1.76-billion budget doesn't include security costs. Originally estimated at $175-million, the security bill is now expected to top $900-million. About half will be spent on services provided by the RCMP. Taxpayers will pick up the entire security tab.</p>
<p>VANOC's budget doesn't include spending on infrastructure projects, such as new highways and transit initiatives, and an $883-million -- and drop-dead gorgeous --Vancouver convention centre, built to coincide with the Games and to meet visitor and media requirements.</p>
<p>Vancouver ratepayers expect to be saddled with debt associated with an athletes' village downtown; completion of its interminable and allegedly shoddy construction is now a municipal responsibility, thanks to a private financing imbroglio triggered by the economic crisis.</p>
<p>Some of these extras -- the new transit routes, especially -- were needed and would likely have been built regardless of the Games. Vancouver will be better for all of them. No one ever promised they'd come freely, let alone on budget.</p>
<p>VANOC, on the other hand, remains zero-deficit committed. Speaking to reporters this week after a scheduled VANOC board meeting, Mr. Cobb did not move from that longstanding pledge. He did not project rock-solid confidence, either.</p>
<p>Certain assumptions have been made. Some budget targets seem ill-defined. For example, almost 14% of VANOC's total operating revenue is to come from nebulous "Other" sources.</p>
<p>In a terse note to its now-discarded 2007 budget document, VANOC said that "Other" revenue "comes from a variety of sources, some confirmed, and the rest from areas to be further planned and activated over the next three years." Among the "key areas targeted," the note reads, is "Internet revenue." A quaint notion, it now seems.</p>
<p>VANOC has still not indicated the source of half its anticipated $237-million "Other" income.</p>
<p>Mr. Cobb did acknowledge this week that there are gaps on the revenue side. Unsold international sponsorships account for a $30-million hole in the Games balance sheet.</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that these international sponsorships will sell; there's little time left for a new sponsor to get full marketing value for its money.</p>
<p>VANOC is struggling to sell a glut of unsold advertising inventory. Specifically, "out of home" billboard spots in communities surrounding metro Vancouver. The shortfall there is $12-million.</p>
<p>Premium ticket sales are languishing. Want to purchase a bells and whistles VIP package, starting at $145,000? There are plenty available. VANOC has sold only a third of its original target figure.</p>
<p>Mr. Cobb expects that VANOC will suck dry another $27-million revenue contingency fund before the Games have ended next February. The money will likely be spent to cover shortfalls in advertising revenue.</p>
<p>A $100-million contingency fund for Games venues has already been depleted; there's just $310,000 left in that kitty. Fortunately, construction on the venues is all but finished. But there's barely any margin left for changes or improvements.</p>
<p>About the only certainty is that VANOC will not spend less than $176-million.</p>
<p>Things could be worse. Vancouver can count itself lucky not to be hosting the 2012 Olympic Summer Games, awarded to London, England. Organizers there think they can get the job done for a bit more than $17-billion.</p>

<p>If you wanted to draw up a list of potential dangers to public safety, it's tough to top a bomb-maker who writes threatening letters.</p>
<p>So it's understandable the <span class="companylink">EnCana</span> pipeline bomber is again making headlines, this time with warnings of bigger explosions in northeastern British Columbia.</p>
<p>But there's another menace stalking us along the B. C.-Alberta border, one that isn't getting nearly as much attention. It doesn't send angry letters to the editor and it's not being chased by the RCMP. But it does warrant its own government webpage and a squad of scientists to track its every move.</p>
<p>Say hello to the mountain pine beetle.</p>
<p>You've no doubt heard of the beetle and perhaps seen its handiwork in the patchwork of dead and dying trees colouring whole swaths of the countryside red and yellow, as if autumn had descended on the evergreen forests. The beetle, in cahoots with a symbiotic organism called the blue-stained fungus, has devastated B. C. forests and has set its antennae on Alberta where, according to the Alberta Forest Products Association, it has infected about three million trees.</p>
<p>If you're a lodgepole pine or jack-pine, the pine beetle is the H1N1 virus, smallpox and bubonic plague all rolled into one. The only effective treatment after infection is amputation with a chainsaw. Last winter's cold weather did manage to put a dent in the beetles' numbers, but after scientists examined almost 1,400 trees they announced this week the mountain pine beetles "remain the single greatest threat to the health of the province's forests."</p>
<p>It's apparently going to get worse --not only if you're a pine tree but also if you're a forestry worker, tourist operator or plain old taxpayer who has to foot the bill to fight the infestation.</p>
<p>Or even if you just love Jasper and Banff national parks.</p>
<p>A recent Alberta Finance study on the province's economic "performance and prospects" spells it out: "As the mountain pine beetle outbreak makes its way over the Rockies from British Columbia, Alberta's national parks will be seriously threatened and may see significant and rapid tree mortality over the coming decade.</p>
<p>"Such a blemish on the face of these provincial treasures could have significant consequences for the Alberta tourism market."</p>
<p>Kathy Burden, spokeswoman for Banff National Park, calls that statement "speculation" and points out visitations to the park this year are up five per cent over last year. By "visitations" she means humans, but she acknowledges visitations by pine beetles are up, too.</p>
<p>The beetle is a naturally occurring species in the park, but its numbers are ballooning and it is moving well beyond its natural range, heading east and north.</p>
<p>Wardens are trying to keep it in check through prescribed burns. So, too, are Alberta government officials who set controlled forest fires and cut down infected trees. Another technique is something of a pine beetle sting operation, in which scientists lure the insects to a tree treated with a synthetic beetle hormone--and then destroy the pest.</p>
<p>But the beetle's relentless march continues. And we have no one to blame but ourselves.</p>
<p>According to the Alberta government's official pine beetle web page: "Modern fire suppression has resulted in large areas of pine forests with over-mature trees, which are more susceptible to beetle attack."</p>
<p>Over-mature means trees older than 80. In other words, we have been so successful at fighting forest fires we have allowed trees to live well past their normal retirement age. It would seem we aren't the only species struggling with an aging population. Call it the backwoods boomer generation.</p>
<p>Another explanation: Milder weather has meant more of the beetles survive the winter to fight another day and are gradually spreading north and east into Alberta.</p>
<p>In other words, blame climate change.</p>
<p>Allan Carroll, a research scientist at the Canadian Forest Service, says the explosion in the beetles population wasn't initially caused by climate change but by the forest-management techniques that allowed more and more trees to get older and older.</p>
<p>Climate change poured fuel on the fire.</p>
<p>"In the last 30 years, there's been an increase in the amount of habitat that we would consider to be perfect for mountain pine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle has followed right closely on the heels of these improvements and invaded areas where it couldn't be before," says Carroll, who adds "there is a very strong signal for range expansion on the part of the beetle as a result of climate warming."</p>
<p>Making things even worse is the fact that all those dead trees do not absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Instead, as they rot they emit carbon back into the atmosphere to contribute to global warming. One research paper from the Canadian Forest Service estimates that by 2020, the beetle's devastation in B. C. alone will release the equivalent of one billion tonnes of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>So, while Alberta makes plans to capture and sequester underground five million tonnes of industrial carbon dioxide each year by 2015, our beetling neighbours to the west will be in effect emitting 200 times that amount, one dead tree at a time.</p>
<p>It might not be as dramatic as a bomber blowing up a pipeline, but as far as public safety is concerned, it's a real threat.</p>

</div><div>The Gazette</div>
<div>856 words</div><div>18 July 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>In an ordinary year with normal summer weather, the kennel and cattery that Sandra Gray operates in Vaudreuil-Dorion is usually all booked up for the annual construction holiday a month in advance.</p>
<p>This summer, however, as rain has followed rain and the five-day outlook has generally called for more rain, bookings have lagged.</p>
<p>But as bad as things looked just a week ago, a sudden surge in what Gray calls "last-minute" reservations has left her Chez Sandra Chalet and Spa with no vacancy today, Day 1 of the two-week construction break.</p>
<p>"Everything has been delayed this year," she said. "Some people have been waiting to see what the weather will be like. Others have booked last-minute flight deals. They say they want to get away from the bad weather here." It's been a waiting game on the vacation front this summer - waiting to see if the weather will improve, and waiting to see if hints of economic recovery are for real.</p>
<p>With household debt and job insecurity at high levels these days, individuals and families are becoming more cautious about their vacation spending, said Claude Péloquin, a Montreal tourism researcher.</p>
<p>People are travelling shorter distances for vacations than they did a decade ago - and within this new reality, they are relying on five-day weather forecasts to help them choose where to go, or whether to travel at all.</p>
<p>Péloquin, an analyst with the tourism-research unit of Université de Québec à Montréal's school of management, says the five-day weather forecast "has become one of the most important influences" in the tourism business.</p>
<p>Diane Leblond, director general of Tourisme Laurentides, says some hotels in St. Sauveur can go from 30-per-cent booked in the morning to 100-per-cent a few hours later, solely on the basis of a sunny morning and favourable weather outlook.</p>
<p>The Conference Board of Canada's most recent Travel Intentions Survey, conducted in April, confirmed other studies showing a growing number of Canadians plan to stick close to home this summer to keep a lid on spending.</p>
<p>"Canadians appear to be more interested in paying down debt and increasing their savings - that's why the the research is telling us," said Greg Hermus, associate director of the conference board's Canadian Tourism Research Institute.</p>
<p>Canadian travel to the U.S. started to decline last fall, he said, while travel overseas has only recently begun to decline. Travel within Canada for the purpose of visiting family or friends is expected to be the least negatively affected travel category, he said.</p>
<p>Travel to Canada also is down overall, said Hermus.</p>
<p>The number of overseas visitors was down 10 per cent through May of this year, compared with the same period last year, he said. And while same-day travel from the U.S. was down only 2.9 per cent through May, new passport regulations that came into effect June 1 are expected to result in a 10-per-cent decline overall this year, said Hermus.</p>
<p>Kurt Schroeder, director of sales and marketing for Banff-Lake Louise Tourism, said concerns about the H1N1 virus have caused a big drop in Asian tourists to the Banff-Lake Louise area northwest of Calgary.</p>
<p>But just as Gray in Vaudreuil-Dorion has noticed huge pent-up last-minute demand, Schroeder says travel wholesalers that he deals with have similarly reported a surge in last-minute bookings for tours to the Banff-Lake Louise area.</p>
<p>News reports last week suggesting renewed strength in Canada's real estate market might be behind the surge, he speculated.</p>
<p>"The whole consumer-confidence issue is a big factor when it comes to spending on travel," said Hermus.</p>
<p>Péloquin said increasing weather volatility resulted in many more families opting for urban vacations. Instead of driving from Montreal to Cape Cod against the gloomy headwind of a poor five-day weather forecast, Péloquin said families are discovering the weatherproof virtues of big cities with museums, theatres and other indoor attractions.</p>
<p>In Europe, <span class="companylink">Ryanair</span> and other discount airliners have crafted new "three-day weekend urban getaway" packages that have become increasingly popular with middle-class travellers, said Péloquin.</p>
<p>Péloquin said the softening of demand for travel to London and Paris and other destinations popular with Montrealers has seen airlines start to post last-minute deals for $600 return.</p>
<p>"You hardly ever see these prices for high season, but you're seeing them now."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu losing strength in Canada as summer progresses; But health minister says there still are 'pockets of more severe illness'</b>
</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>446 words</div><div>18 July 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Health authorities saw indications this week that the swine flu is finally entering the summer recess that was expected, as the number of Canadians treated for flu symptoms dipped, but they are cautioning not to be complacent because the virus is still circulating.</p>
<p>"This week we have seen a decrease in the rates of people seeking medical care for flu-like symptoms, suggesting that community transmission is decreasing and most people affected by the flu are recovering at home without treatment," federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq told reporters yesterday in providing an update on the pandemic.</p>
<p>While the majority of cases are mild, the health minister said there are still "pockets of more severe illness" in some communities.</p>
<p>The latest numbers indicate that 10,156 people have been diagnosed with swine flu, also known as the H1N1 virus, and 1,115 people required hospitalization.</p>
<p>There was a 21-per-cent increase in the reported number of hospitalizations this week, but David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said that spike could be because of delayed reporting to federal officials from the provinces and territories.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying we're over this yet," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>"But the general indication, the feeling in general, is that we are seeing less than we were, but that doesn't mean we're not seeing new cases and that doesn't mean it will continue to decline for sure."</p>
<p>Influenza viruses are "full of surprises," said Butler-Jones, who would not tie himself to a prediction of how much worse the pandemic will get when the regular flu season begins in the fall.</p>
<p>"We don't know when it will return, we don't know if it will actually ever completely go away," he said.</p>
<p>"We're still seeing new cases. It appears that there are fewer, it appears that we are seeing fewer people admitted to hospital, so it seems to be on the wane, but we're still seeing cases so nobody should let down their guard."</p>
<p>This week, several clusters of swine flu were detected at summer camps in Ontario, causing concern and confusion among parents about what to do with their camp-bound children this summer.</p>
<p>The health minister said a guidance document has been posted on the public health agency's website related to swine flu and summer camps.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said Canada remains on track in its development of a vaccine for the swine flu, which is a new strain of the influenza virus.</p>

</p>
<p>In the wake of recent swine flu outbreaks at summer camps in B.C. and elsewhere, the province's top health officer is advising camps to be on alert for children who show symptoms of the virus.</p>
<p>"We expect to see the virus spread," health officer Dr. Perry Kendall said Friday. "Children's camps are likely to be hot spots."</p>
<p>Kendall issued a set of guidelines Friday for the prevention and management of the H1N1 flu after he confirmed outbreaks at two camps in the B.C. Interior last week.</p>
<p>Several Ontario camps have also recently seen massive outbreaks of H1N1.</p>
<p>"Influenza viruses circulate very quickly among children because children have no previous immunity and they are in close contact with each other," Dr. Kendall said.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus spreads just like a seasonal flu, through coughing, sneezing and contact with contaminated surfaces and objects.</p>
<p>The guidelines advise camps to be vigilant when enforcing existing safety protocols, including regular hand-washing. They advise camps to isolate sick children, maintain emergency contact lists, and practice proper sneezing and coughing etiquette.</p>
<p>Kendall also suggests that parent orientation packages include a list of H1N1 symptoms, as well as the camp safety protocols.</p>
<p>As well, parents should keep their kids at home if they show any signs of illness, he said.</p>
<p>In most cases, H1N1 is a mild infection, but parents of children with special needs or health concerns should talk to their doctor about the risks of summer camp, Dr. Kendall said.</p>
<p>"The idea is not to shut down the camps and stop the kids from going into the camps, but to let kids have a great summer camp experience," Dr. Kendall said.</p>
<p>Jason Lee, manager of clubs and camp for the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Vancouver, said his organization isn't too worried.</p>
<p>"It's about making sure we practice due diligence," Lee said. "The safety of our kids is always a worry and concern for us whether it's H1N1 or anything else."</p>
<p>Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Vancouver runs nine day camps and one overnight camp. Staff are working to prevent a flu outbreak by using disinfectant, isolating sick kids and consulting with parents.</p>

</p>
<p>The world does not yet know how serious or deadly the H1N1 flu pandemic may become. But as Canadians brace for another flu season in the fall, they can take comfort in the fact that their federal government has served and guarded them well.</p>
<p>While countries around the world will be scrambling for their share of the limited supply of flu vaccine -- if and when it becomes available -- Canadians stand an exceptionally good chance of being vaccinated.</p>
<p>That's because in 2001, Canada signed a contract with a drug company that was eventually bought by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>. The deal obliges the pharmaceutical manufacturer to provide vaccine to every Canadian who wants it if there is a pandemic. And in this case, the vaccine would actually be produced in Canada, making it even more likely it will be available to Canadians.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 2006, the federal government earmarked $1 billion for pandemic planning and emergency preparedness. That forethought should pay off if the going gets rough later this year.</p>
<p>Not all countries are as lucky. Both the United States and Britain, where officials this week predicted a worst-case pandemic scenario of 65,000 deaths, fear they will not be able to acquire enough vaccine. In contrast, Canada is in an enviable position and for this our federal health officials deserve thanks.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>I'm tired of 'news' -- I'm going to my tent</b>
</div><div>Tara Klager   </div>
<div>716 words</div><div>18 July 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>It is possible that after spending the night outside on an air mattress in the cold, damp of a tent -- with my own cosy bed just out of reach -- that I may not have been in the proper frame of mind to sift through headlines.</p>
<p>I am willing to cop to a cumulative crankiness due to deprivation. It's only natural. After all, when you've just spent 12 hours in a tent to please the kids you tend to build up a level of fractiousness.</p>
<p>And when you finally stagger inside, hair askew and with an interesting relief map of lines impressed on one's face making for a passable likeness to Kieff, and you find your way to a cup of coffee and begin to assess the damage, one's ability to keep the snarls at bay is, well, impaired.</p>
<p>And it was in this edifying frame of mind that I wandered through cyber space to a variety of news sites. Good gracious. It's all going to hell, isn't it?</p>
<p>Let us take a quick gander, shall we? Over here we have reports of H1N1's impending mutation into something much nastier than its current form. Prophetic experts shaking their heads and bellowing on about the critical shortage of ventilators, people crowding hospitals, death tolls into the hundreds of thousands. Cheery.</p>
<p>We move on to the epic silliness of the G8 -- has it outlived its usefulness? What momentous decisions have come from this meeting of assorted pointy heads? Difficult to say. The Canadian media machine (note the singular) appears to be preoccupied with the neverending saga of photo ops and counting gleefully on their fingers. Even my tomatoes are not safe against the ravages of something called potato blight -- which apparently triggered the Irish potato famine -- and is galloping this way from points further west.</p>
<p>You know, I feel a bit depressed. Let's head across the ocean to the U.K. Surely someone has something to say over there to help lift this suffocating gloom.</p>
<p>Alas. From the Independent: The Planet's Future: Climate Change Will Cause Civilization to Collapse. That doesn't help at all, really.</p>
<p>This is a problem. Between apocalyptic reports on world-ending and trivial nonsense from smug reporters, I am rather at a loss. It all sounds as though it's going terribly wrong, doesn't it? If influenza doesn't get me, I might as well curl up and wait for climate change to take me out. The economy will have left me defenceless at any rate -- cold, alone and tomatoless, wandering the God-forsaken hills without a place to lay my matted head.</p>
<p>Surely I am not alone in having had enough of all this. Rather like the music festival I attended earlier this week. Amid all the dueling chords and vocals, my overworked ears simply shut down and I didn't hear anything very much, just a general buzzing. It all receded into the background where my subconscious could keep an ear on it but my busy frontal lobes could get on with enjoying my surroundings. And there was much to enjoy.</p>
<p>Life is going on -- and quite successfully too. There is good news out there. But all the ceaseless bleating -- the Portents and Signs and Prophesy, Oh My! -- by "news" organizations are making my teeth itch. While there is some value in the public's right to know -- there are a few things I do need to know -- surely it's only a very small portion of what's currently, breathlessly on offer?</p>
<p>In an effort to sort out what I need to know, and what I can get along very well without, I find myself tuning out vast swaths of it. The louder they shriek, the more I hum summer road trip songs (Say Hey!). The shriller they get, the more bewitching birdsong becomes. The louder they bang on about how much I should be afraid, the sweeter the silence in my own backyard.</p>
<p>I'm heading back to the tent.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ottawa considers culling hogs; H1N1, feed prices add to industry's decline</b>

</p>
<p>WINNIPEG -- The federal government is poised to trim the fat out of Canada's hog industry and is considering culling the entire sector by up to 20 per cent to do it.</p>
<p>The move would respond to pleas from a struggling pork industry that has found itself overextended in recent years as flagging demand and high feed prices have sheared profits down to nothing.</p>
<p>“We can't continue on like this,” said Jurgen Preugschas, an Alberta hog farmer and president of the Canadian Pork Council. “I can't pay my bills right now. That's why we need the government to step in and assist producers so that the industry can stay in the game. Otherwise, a meltdown would jeopardize about 42,000 jobs.”</p>
<p>In past years, the council has urged the federal government to assist tapped-out hog producers with loans and advances that would keep their operations afloat until favourable markets returned.</p>
<p>But the lobby group now seems resigned to the prospect that the high times are gone for good.</p>
<p>In its recently released Strategic Transition Plan, the pork council calls on the federal government to buy out the worst-off producers at $500 per sow, plus the market value of the animal. By 2014, the plan foresees an 18-per-cent drop in Canadian pork production, from 31 million pigs in 2008, down to 25.5 million. That would follow on a 13-per-cent contraction over the past three years, according to Statistics Canada figures.</p>
<p>“We are having day-to-day discussions with Canadian Pork Council,” Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said yesterday, “reviewing their proposal, and working together to find a solution that will help hog producers in this difficult economic climate.”</p>
<p>The brunt of those difficulties comes from a dismal bit of math: producers need more than $150 per pig to break even, but they're only getting around $120.</p>
<p>“Usually the summer brings a rise to about $170,” said Mr. Preugschas. “But we just haven't seen the increase this year.”</p>
<p>A battery of events have contributed to the shortfall. The H1N1 outbreak, also called swine flu, closed off a number of international markets and weakened North American demand. The recession has also severely cut down protein consumption in all forms. And new Country of Origin Labelling requirements in the Unites States have severely interrupted cross-border shipments.</p>
<p>“Before the COOL laws, the business model between Canada and the U.S. worked very well,” said Mr. Preugschas. “The U.S. government wrecked a very good business model.”</p>
<p>But the biggest hit of all has come in the from of skyrocketing feed prices. Corn that once went for $2 a bushel now hovers around $3 – with no drop in sight.</p>
<p>“I think that this shift in prices is set for the long term,” said Derek Brewin, agricultural economics professor at the University of Manitoba. “The ethanol programs in the U.S. have pushed corn higher, and that will likely remain that way.”</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture will be announcing some manner of assistance package in the coming weeks. So far, Mr. Ritz is only offering a verbal boost to the industry: “Canadians can help tremendously by putting more pork on their fork and their barbecues this summer.”</p>

</p>
<p>Game: Prototype</p>
<p>Platforms: PlayStation3, Xbox 360, Windows PC</p>
<p>Rating: Mature</p>
<p>Alex Mercer is not your traditional superhero. Truth be told, he's not much of a hero at all.</p>
<p>Over the course of Prototype, he will kill thousands of people, and a good number of his victims will be innocent bystanders. Don't get me wrong -- that's not the point of this game. However, there will be scores of collateral damage as you traipse through this game's version of New York City, attempting to get to the bottom of a plague sweeping across the country -- and we're not talking swine flu here.</p>
<p>The plague is man-made, and the result is a quarantined Big Apple. Those who have caught the plague have evolved into uncontrollable monstrosities bent on destruction.</p>
<p>Mercer is on a quest to find out who inflicted this curse on him and his city, and to exact his vengeance. What sets Alex apart from the masses is that his infection has granted him superpowers.</p>
<p>In order to unravel the tangled web of clues, Alex will have to take the form of various civilians or military personnel (which, in a city of millions, is thankfully aided by the game's pointing out your targets). There is, of course, a minor side-effect to doing this, as it results in the death of your target.</p>
<p>Mercer has the ability to grow massive claws, which he can use to eviscerate those who stand in the way, be it the military or the infected. He can conjure up a biological shield to deflect huge attacks; he can jump really high and run really fast. And that's just the start.</p>
<p>As Alex completes missions and finds out more about his own infection, the player can spend points in gaining new abilities. Mercer can complete a lot of optional missions that allow him to gain more experience points to spend on his ability screen.</p>
<p>While Prototype's storyline is passable, it won't win any awards. There are some silly moments revolving around the few people close to Alex. It's one thing for a couple of people to die at the hands of Alex for the greater good, but when one of these friends tags along with you as you drive a tank over a couple hundred civilians and no one bats an eye, something's wrong.</p>
<p>There are a lot of awesome moments in Prototype. There's a satisfying feeling drop-kicking a helicopter into oblivion. The stylized brutality is stomach-churning and yet very cool. Simply running straight up the sides of buildings and gliding around the city doesn't get old, either, but if you prefer games that are story-driven with epic narratives, Prototype might not be up your alley. The story is kind of dull, but the action is great-- and in a game like this, that's about all that matters anyway.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Trips instead of toasters; Destination weddings up 400 per cent</b>
</div><div>Valerie Berenyi   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>747 words</div><div>18 July 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>H4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Two of the hottest wedding trends both involve travel.</p>
<p>Brides and grooms looking to cut wedding costs are flying off to exotic places for so-called destination weddings. And those tying the knot in a more traditional fashion are signing up at honeymoon gift registries, where guests can contribute to a trip instead of a toaster.</p>
<p>"In Canada, destination weddings have quadrupled-- they're up 400 per cent since 2001," said Danielle Andrews Sunkel, the Toronto-based president of the Wedding Planners Institute of Canada, which represents 1,200 wedding planners across the country.</p>
<p>"It's another way to save money because you can combine your wedding and your honeymoon-- and you'll have a dramatically shortened guest list because not everyone can afford to travel where you're going," said Alison McGill, editor-in-chief of Weddingbells, which is devoting an upcoming issue to the subject of destination weddings.</p>
<p>"It's rare to have more than 30 people at a destination wedding, and lots of places right now are offering amazing packages."</p>
<p>Barry Davis, a travel agent who specializes in wedding packages for Marlin Travel, said the Mayan Riviera in Mexico and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic are the two most popular destinations for couples.</p>
<p>Mexico's tourism industry was hit hard by the swine flu outbreak, Davis said, and there are now good deals to be had for under $1,000 per person for airfare and a week's stay at a five-star, all-inclusive resort.</p>
<p>Typically though, brides and grooms should budget $2,000 per person, he said. Wedding packages are sometimes thrown in for free or can cost up to$3,000, depending on the level of detail such as flowers, cake, photos, etc.</p>
<p>Lisa Hanslip, owner of The Wedding Planner in Calgary, cautions brides and grooms about off-loading expenses onto their guests' shoulders.</p>
<p>"Doing a destination wedding puts less of a financial burden on the bride and groom, but it costs sometimes as much as 20 times more for your guests to attend," said Hanslip.</p>
<p>"That's an unfair burden to be putting on your guests in these economic times. At the best of times, you're forcing certain people to relegate their entire vacation allotment to going to your wedding. But brides and grooms should be paying more attention to the fact that times are tough right now."</p>
<p>She said she's had conversations with several 20-somethings who complain they're just starting out in their careers--and don't make much money or get many vacation days--and their friends are jetting off to get married in Hawaii or Mexico to save money.</p>
<p>She also points out that the trend of holding bridal showers or stagettes in places like Las Vegas adds further financial burden for members of the bridal party.</p>
<p>As for honeymoons, there's been a 29-per-cent increase in travel being listed on wedding gift registries, according to Weddingbells' annual reader survey, which polled 1,344 readers.</p>
<p>"Most couples--75 per cent--live together before they get married," said McGill. "They've set up a home together and probably have most of their household essentials, so people are gifting experiences instead."</p>
<p>Richelle Mychasiuk and Aaron Saunders, engaged to be married Aug. 15, registered at a local travel agency for their honeymoon. Guests can donate to the couple's trip, a Mediterranean cruise.</p>
<p>"We've been living (together) for three years in a house and we kind of have everything that we need," said Mychasiuk.</p>
<p>Nothing to do with gifts--honeymoon contributions included--should be included on the invitation, said Hanslip.</p>
<p>"People have lost sight of what the registry is for. It's not so you can dictate what people give you; it's to be accommodating to your guests."</p>
<p>That's what your bridal party and your family are for: they can tell people what gifts would be welcome. The modern exception? It's OK to post the information on one's wedding website, Hanslip said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>New tracking system carries old baggage; H1N1 virus surveillance is now more focused, but still relies on local agencies to volunteer data</b>
</div><div>Joanna Smith   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>589 words</div><div>18 July 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Federal public health officials have launched a new way of tracking the spread of the H1N1 virus with a weekly online report designed to spot trends such as a higher number of hospitalizations or other unusual activity.</p>
<p>"The goal of surveillance is to assess the impact of the H1N1 flu virus on our communities so that we can adapt our planned responses to the situation at hand," chief public health officer David Butler-Jones said at a news conference yesterday.</p>
<p>"Counting individual cases no longer serves a useful public health purpose."</p>
<p>The new national surveillance system comes after the World Health Organization this week urged countries to stop trying to confirm all cases through laboratory testing because it was consuming too many resources and yielding little new information that would help to prepare for a pandemic.</p>
<p>It replaces thrice-weekly updates on the number of individual cases by the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>Data released yesterday by the agency indicated the median age of swine flu cases among Inuit people is significantly younger than that among other Canadians. The median age of Inuit cases is 9, half the median for First Nations cases (19 years) and non-aboriginal Canadians (18 years).</p>
<p>"Nunavut has a young population compared to the Canadian population," the agency said, referring to the predominantly Inuit territory.</p>
<p>The report said 11 per cent of laboratory confirmed cases have been hospitalized so far.</p>
<p>Confirmed cases represent only the tip of the iceberg of all pandemic flu cases as a vast majority don't require medical care and therefore don't come to the attention of authorities.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, 49 people in Canada have died from infection with the new H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The information provided on the new surveillance system is more intelligent but comes from the same source: a patchwork of provincial and territorial public health agencies across the country and all but Ontario are under no formal obligation to share.</p>
<p>Critics argue the voluntary nature of sharing information compromises the ability to properly track the rate of infection and understand the virus in order to prevent it from growing into a much bigger problem.</p>
<p>Auditor General Sheila Fraser has described this situation as a fundamental weakness in the federal system designed to detect and monitor infectious diseases.</p>
<p>"To obtain routine surveillance information, the agency relies on the goodwill of the provinces and territories," she said. "However, due to gaps in its information-sharing agreements with them, it is not assured of receiving timely, accurate, and complete information."</p>
<p>Ontario - as part of its response to the legacy of the SARS outbreak - is the only province or territory to have signed an information-sharing agreement that revived a regular flow of details about individual cases to the federal government.</p>
<p>Susan Bondy, an epidemiologist with the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto, said interpretations of privacy legislation often get in the way of sharing important information about infectious diseases.</p>
<p>"It's very important to protect the rights of individuals and to protect people from harm related to a breach of their privacy, but it's a delicate balance in terms of finding the ability," said Bondy. "You want the right information to be able to flow at least when there is goodwill to do so."</p>

<p>Ottawa</p>
<p>Three leaders to meet</p>
<p>in Mexico next month</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper will meet U.S. President Barack Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calderon next month in Mexico.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's Office says the meeting, to take place Aug. 9 and 10 in Guadalajara, will touch on the economy, energy, the environment and other issues of "mutual continental interest." Those are likely to include Ottawa's new requirement that visitors from Mexico obtain travel visas to enter Canada. A White House spokesman said the swine flu pandemic is also likely to be on the agenda.</p>
<p>Slovenian salesman</p>
<p>loses extradition fight</p>
<p>A Richmond Hill man who was once the whiz-kid manager of Slovenia's biggest capital funds has failed to persuade Justice Minister Rob Nicholson to stop his extradition to his homeland.</p>
<p>Nicholson yesterday ordered Bostjan Soba returned to Slovenia to face charges he helped a politician defraud the government of nearly $200,000 nine years ago.</p>
<p>Soba, a top car salesman before he was jailed here eight months ago, came to Canada in 2006 and asked for refugee status on the grounds he was persecuted and his life was at risk in Slovenia. He argued the case against him was laced with lies and he could not get a fair trial because he had investigated rights abuses in his country.</p>
<p>British Columbia</p>
<p>Constable admits</p>
<p>he beat delivery man</p>
<p>A West Vancouver police officer has pleaded guilty to assaulting a newspaper delivery man earlier this year.</p>
<p>Const. Griffin Gillan, 25, was with two officers from other municipalities when Phil Khan was beaten in the early hours of Jan. 21. Court heard Gillan consumed more than 20 drinks before assaulting Khan outside a Vancouver hotel.</p>
<p>Alberta</p>
<p>Suspect denies trying</p>
<p>to kill RCMP with car</p>
<p>A Saskatoon man has pleaded not guilty to 14 charges including attempted murder in an incident last July that left an Alberta RCMP officer with serious injuries.</p>
<p>Const. Danny Knight of Innisfail RCMP was struck by a vehicle fleeing police on the main highway between Calgary and Edmonton. He had been trying to lay a spike belt on the road. It's alleged the vehicle then nearly hit two other officers.</p>
<p>Kenneth Thomas Janzen, 25, is scheduled to go to trial in March.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia</p>
<p>Taser officer favoured</p>
<p>the element of surprise</p>
<p>A Halifax police officer did not issue a warning before Tasering a mentally ill man who later died in custody because he did not want to lose the element of surprise, a fatality inquiry heard yesterday.</p>
<p>Special Const. Greg McCormick, testifying at the inquiry into the death of Howard Hyde, also said verbal warnings in advance of Tasering could make a non-compliant person even more aggressive.</p>
<p>Hyde, 45, was Tasered in the booking area of Halifax police headquarters on Nov. 21, 2007, after he was arrested on a domestic assault complaint. Thirty hours later, Hyde died at a correctional facility after a struggle with guards.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>WestJet adds flights to sunny destinations -</b>
</div><div>Ask Journeys / Ron Pradinuk   </div>
<div>858 words</div><div>18 July 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>E2</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Just as we were feeling that Winnipeg was being shortchanged for the winter season, WestJet flies to the rescue with an announcement that they will increase service to Phoenix to four times per week and fly three times a week non-stop to Orlando. Not only have they initiated new destinations and added frequency, but both of the above services will commence on Nov. 1.</p>
<p>Not just from Winnipeg, but from cities throughout the country, Westjet has made a commitment to delivering more destinations with more frequency than ever before to our favourite sunspots. The one thing that WestJet also does better than any other carrier is create schedules with connections from other cities that very often do not require overnight stays.</p>
<p>QUESTION: We are considering a fall Mediterranean cruise but we are concerned about being stranded if there should be an outbreak of H1N1. What happens and will our insurance cover us?</p>
<p>ANSWER: So far as we know, travel insurance companies have not added any riders on their policies that would not ensure coverage in the event of a serious outbreak. What needs to be understood is that most policies only come into effect after the government has issued a high-level warning against travel to any specific region.</p>
<p>When the outbreak occurred in Mexico, a number of people chose not to take their trips because of the publicity, but before the government warning was actually issued. Had they gone, they would have been flown back, but because they were a no-show they got no sympathy from the tour operator or the insurance company.</p>
<p>It is an interesting note that while travel warnings relating to H1N1 have been lifted by the Canadian government to most destinations, Canada is still listed as a country not to travel to at this time, specifically because of what they suggest is a widespread prevalence of the disease here.</p>
<p>While all this is a serious matter, one could conclude that perhaps we are safer to leave our country rather than stay in it, if we are to heed the warnings of other nations about us.</p>
<p>QUESTION: We travel to Victoria, every year and have always purchased insurance. Our friends say we are wasting our money because health care is national. What is your advice?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Believe me, you are doing the right thing in providing yourself maximum coverage. It is correct that, from a pure health perspective, you will get the care you require from hospitals and doctors all over Canada.</p>
<p>However, the premium you pay for out-of-province coverage is very reasonable and covers you for things that are not a part of your provincial health plan.</p>
<p>It could include an air ambulance back home, a regular ambulance to get to the hospital and any of the other benefits you may require that do not fall into the reciprocal arrangements.</p>
<p>An air ambulance can cost thousands of dollars and like most insurance policies, we hope you never need it, but it's good to have it... just in case.</p>
<p>QUESTION: We will be spending time in Rome in August and have been told it will be hot and crowded. I am concerned about getting around as I am not young and wonder if they help senior citizens at all to get in to the major sights faster?</p>
<p>ANSWER: People in wheelchairs do get to the front of the line very quickly in most places, along with the people with whom they are travelling. Other than that, everyone, regardless of age, is treated pretty much equally. You need to pace yourself and I do hope you are spending enough days in this fascinating city to experience its grandeur and greatness. We were there in September last year and even then it was quite hot most days, from morning to night.</p>
<p>However, we did find a solution, since we also were travelling with someone who was in her mid-80s. We hired a company called Driver in Italy. There are a number of these qualified driver-for-hire companies in Rome. This was not an inexpensive service but split between four of us in their van, it came to about $250 each.</p>
<p>This seems like a lot of money but we all agreed after the fact that it was perhaps the best investment we made during the entire journey. In one day we saw what we believe would have taken us at least three days on our own.</p>
<p>We were ushered to the front of the line at every venue and our driver was an exceptional tour guide who made the day a completely satisfying experience.</p>
<p>In air-conditioned comfort we could travel from place to place knowing he would be waiting for us close to the sight we were visiting.</p>

<p>Saskatchewan health officials have confirmed another death associated with the H1N1 virus, bringing the total number of deaths in the province to four since the virus was first detected here.</p>
<p>The latest victim is said to be a woman in her 50s, who died in hospital on Thursday. Like the other three people, whose deaths have been linked to the H1N1 virus, the woman was said to have serious underlying health problems.</p>
<p>No further information was being provided with regard to the woman's identity.</p>
<p>The other deaths in the province involved a woman in her 40s, a man in his 70s and a child under 10 years of age.</p>
<p>Health officials have confirmed a total of 870 people have tested positive for the virus as of Friday. While this is an increase of 11 new cases since Wednesday, Karen Hill, a spokesman for the ministry of health said, the number of new cases is beginning to stabilize.</p>
<p>"We are seeing an average of about 11 new confirmed cases every two or three days. Medical health officers have told me we are pretty much seeing a decline in influenza-like illnesses throughout Saskatchewan right now.'' Hill said.</p>

</div><div>By Mary Agnes Welch </div>
<div>410 words</div><div>17 July 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>A Manitoba chief says he doesn't want corporate donors allowing Ottawa to shirk its responsibilty for keeping First Nations safe from H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"It's really sad when a First Nations treaty right to health becomes a charity issue," said Norway House Cree Nation Chief Marcel Balfour. "This sets a interesting precedent. Are we going to start a corporate fundraising plan for housing in my community?"</p>
<p>Balfour was reacting to news that CIBC was the first corporation to donate $10,000 to the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs campaign to buy 15,000 swine flu kits for northern communities hit hard by the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The AMC hopes to raise $1.5 million for the kits, which include hand sanitizer, masks and anti-bacterial tissue.</p>
<p>Health Canada came under fire recently for delaying a shipment of hand sanitizers to remote northern First Nations because they contained alcohol. The AMC says some communities had to wait almost a month before they got the sanitizers they needed. Meanwhile, First Nations are caught in the middle of a jurisdictional squabble between the provincial and the federal governments over health care on reserves, and many chiefs worry remote communities won't be ready for the winter flu season.</p>
<p>Balfour admitted that, in some ways, the corporate fundraising campaign is brilliant political strategy on AMC's part because it underscores Ottawa's inaction.</p>
<p>Balfour also said he was grateful to CIBC for chipping in to help, but First Nations health shouldn't become the responsibilty of corporate donors looking to improve their public image.</p>
<p>"We need a political commitment to say the First Nations on reserves -- let's even start with the ones in Northern Manitoba that have clearly been the hardest hit -- are a priority," Balfour said. "I need planning and equipment and bodies and doctors and a vaccine program in my community. One medical kit isn't going to do it."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the provincial government Thursday appointed an aboriginal health adviser on H1N1 flu issues.</p>
<p>Dr. Catherine Cook, the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's executive director of aboriginal health programs, will help First Nations communities monitor and respond to the virus better communication between different levels of government.</p>
<p>"This is a disease that in Manitoba appears to have disproportionately affected First Nations communities," Cook said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Love of baseball keeps Strandlund going</b>
</div><div>Cleve Dheensaw </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>459 words</div><div>17 July 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>B5 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist </div>
</p>
<p>The World Baseball Challenge, formerly held in Grand Forks and shifting this year to Prince George, features a powerhouse alumni roster that includes major-leaguers Josh Beckett, Kosuke Fukudome and Jose Contreras.</p>
<p>Of the several Island players in this year's World Challenge, which begins today, none is up in Prince George with more accumulated career mileage than Trevor Strandlund. He began playing senior baseball at Lambrick Park in 1980, before many of his current Victoria Mavericks League teammates and opponents were born.</p>
<p>"It's mostly for the love of baseball that I keep playing," said Strandlund, 46, whose hectic ball schedule would exhaust players 20 years younger.</p>
<p>For the next week Strandlund is a pitcher and coach with the host Prince George Westcana Electric Axemen in the 2009 version of the World Baseball Challenge, one of the top tournaments in Canada. It features Team Canada, Team USA, Team Germany, Team B.C., the Bahamas national side and the Reno Astros. The Chinese team backed out because of concerns over the swine flu.</p>
<p>The defending Canadian senior champion Team B.C. lineup includes Lanny Burrows, Sean Murphy, Russell Taylor and John Margaritis from the Victoria Mavericks League and pitcher Aaron Myette of Surrey, an Olympian for Canada at the 2004 Athens Summer Games and former starter with the Chicago White Sox, Texas Rangers and Cleveland Indians.</p>
<p>Team USA, loaded with potential future pros, consists of the top NCAA collegiate prospects for the 2010 major league draft while Team Canada will feature this nation's best collegians.</p>
<p>Strandlund, and his shortstop/pitcher nephew Charlie Standlund, are stars in the Victoria Mavericks League but will play for Prince George because of an old connection. Trevor Strandlund played pro in the defunct independent Prairie League for the Grand Forks, N.D., Varmints, where he met Varmints GM and vice-president Jim Swanson, organizer of the World Baseball Challenge.</p>
<p>"It was a fun time with players such as Jack Morris and Darryl Strawberry going through the old Prairie League to end their careers and many younger big-league prospects -- and Jim [Swanson] and I kept in touch. So I play for Prince George when I can in tournaments," said Strandlund, a Vic High grad.</p>
<p>For Strandlund, it's have mitt, will travel. He is also annually picked up by the Tacoma Cascades for the Roy Hobbs Over-40s World Series held each year at the Boston Red Sox training complex in Fort Myers, Fla.</p>
<p>And this guy can still throw a howling pitch. Strandlund is 4-1 with a 1.27 ERA this season for the Jays in the Victoria Mavericks League.</p>
<p>"I guess I'm the Jamie Moyer of amateur ball."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canada's big problem -- too few babies</b>
</div><div>Leonard Stern </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>852 words</div><div>17 July 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist </div>
</p>
<p>The headlines are swine flu, terrorism and climate change, but economists know that the real threat to our way of life is the reluctance of women to produce lots of babies.</p>
<p>Well, not just any women. This is about women in the industrialized West. In poor parts of the world, women have plenty of children. Unfortunately, they can't afford them.</p>
<p>Here in the wealthy West we can afford to have more children but we don't. It's the population paradox.</p>
<p>Canada's fertility rate is about 1.54 children per woman. The rate needs to be 2.1 simply to replace ourselves, never mind growing the population.</p>
<p>A nation that doesn't replace itself becomes an aging nation, and that's why economists are terrified. Old people no longer generate wealth, yet they require huge amounts of state support in the form of health care, pensions and other programs.</p>
<p>Babies are cute and all, but their real value is that they grow up, get jobs and contribute to economic growth. Japan's low fertility rate of barely 1.3 children per woman represents as much an existential threat to that country as the nuclear manoeuvrings of North Korea.</p>
<p>If Canada has never really sounded the alarm about the low fertility rate, it's because we had an antidote -- immigration.</p>
<p>After all, we're a nation that is comfortable with, and even celebrates, multiculturalism. Most of us were ourselves once newcomers. A Japanese diplomat once told me that his assignment in Canada was to acquire lessons on the merits of multiculturalism in an effort to convince the Japanese people that, for them also, immigration will fix the problem of an aging society.</p>
<p>Now it turns out that the curative power of immigration was vastly overstated. The sobering revelation arrived last month courtesy of the C.D. Howe Institute, the eminent Canadian think tank.</p>
<p>The C.D. Howe folks crunched the numbers, did the modelling and discovered that the current influx of immigrants -- about 0.67 per cent of the resident population -- barely makes a dent.</p>
<p>The data show that the only way immigration could offset the declining birth rate is if Canada dismantles border controls and floods the country with well over a half million immigrants a year.</p>
<p>Even then, the government would need to impose rigid "age filters" to ensure that only young people are among the new arrivals.</p>
<p>This is radical stuff and therefore politically not feasible.</p>
<p>The security issues are obvious. Absorption would be impossible. The age filters would spell the end of family reunification and would be objected to on humane grounds.</p>
<p>The C.D. Howe Institute acknowledges as much, concluding that the time has come to look at alternatives to immigration.</p>
<p>If Canadians don't want the country to go bankrupt, then we have to start working harder (boosting "output" per worker) and having a lot more children.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these are incompatible goals. The more we are forced to boost our output at the office or factory, the less likely we are to have children.</p>
<p>It's true, for example, that by working insanely hard, the Japanese are able to maintain high productivity despite their low fertility rate. But a 17-hour work day in a Tokyo cubicle, where you feel guilty taking bathroom breaks, is hardly a family-friendly environment. Japan is committing suicide by creating a culture littered with disincentives to childbearing.</p>
<p>So how do we get western women to have more children? There's evidence that accessible child care and similar supports are a big help. But even free daycare might not constitute an "incentive" to have children. At most, it represents the elimination of an obstacle.</p>
<p>The brutal truth is this: The only surefire way to ensure women have lots of children is to deny them sexual equality. (Needless to say, this is an approach I'd oppose.)</p>
<p>Equality has meant giving women opportunities for personal fulfilment beyond childrearing. It has meant that for women, social status is now derived from the same things as for men -- educational achievement, professional advancement, accumulation of wealth.</p>
<p>Conversely, where women achieve status mainly through their role as matriarch you'll find a high birthrate. You don't have to travel to exotic places to find such societies. Right here in the West there are communities where women routinely have five, six, seven children, but these are almost always religious communities -- devout Muslims, Orthodox Jews, serious Catholics and the like.</p>
<p>The birthrate is high not just because women derive status only through the role of matriarch; the birthrate is high because men and women feel they are custodians of sacred traditions and teachings that must be preserved from generation to generation.</p>
<p>Individual autonomy is among the great benefits of the secular West. We are liberated from the obligation to reproduce ourselves. It's all about choice, as it should be. Too bad there's no way, at least none that I can think of, to get young liberal westerners to choose parenthood.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Buying a piece of paradise; This may be right time to buy a getaway, but do your homework</b>
</div><div>Fiona Anderson </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>776 words</div><div>17 July 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>C2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun </div>
</p>
<p>With the recession hitting the United States harder than Canada, and the Canadian dollar still strong, this may be a great time for Canadians to buy that sunny, tranquil getaway in the U.S. or further south. But to make sure it is tranquil, do your due diligence, just like you would at home.</p>
<p>Tom Kelly, a syndicated columnist based in Washington state, has co-authored two books about buying real estate in Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>He believes prices in those areas will go up once American baby boomers recover some of their wealth.</p>
<p>U.S. boomers weren't prepared for the economic downturn and once they rebuild, they are going to look for a cheaper lifestyle. And it's definitely cheaper in Mexico and Central America, Kelly said. Canadians, on the other hand, haven't been as hard hit and were better prepared, he said. So they are in a better position to buy now.</p>
<p>"And the further you go, typically the less expensive it's going to be," Kelly said.</p>
<p>Panama, for example, "is a bargain right now," Kelly said. "But it costs money to get there."</p>
<p>And while Puerto Vallarta and other places in Mexico are easier to get to, deals can be found there too, because not as many people are buying, he said.</p>
<p>The outbreak of H1N1 flu in the spring turned some people off. And the rash of drug-related crime did too, Kelly said.</p>
<p>But Kelly believes Mexico is perfectly safe, with the violence limited to the drug trade near the border. "There's no history of these people targeting non-nationals," Kelly said.</p>
<p>Mexico is also safe from a purchasing perspective with title insurance now available to those buying property, he said.</p>
<p>A lot of the horror stories of people buying in Mexico and ending up with nothing really stemmed from "non-nationals buying property they should have never bought in the first place because nobody owned the title to it," Kelly said.</p>
<p>So just like you would in Canada, "go out and do the due diligence" before you buy, he said. "Don't leave your brains at the border. Check out the property in person to make sure it's what you want, rather than buying off the Internet."</p>
<p>For financing, it's cheaper to remortgage your Canadian property and buy with cash than get local financing. While there are international banks that will lend you money, they will charge more, he said.</p>
<p>David Ingram is a North-Vancouver-based former real estate agent who has made a career out of advising Canadians who want to buy property outside the country, and foreigners who want to buy property in Canada. About 6,000 people attended his seminars last year, an indication of the interest in offshore real estate, Ingram said.</p>
<p>The first thing to remember is, every country, and every state, is different, he said. So get the advice you need to learn the rules before you buy. In Mexico for example, non-nationals aren't allowed to buy within a certain distance of shores or borders, for reasons of national security. But that can be overcome by setting up a trust to purchase the property, for which title insurance is available.</p>
<p>Other things to think about are local laws relating to rentals. If the property is to be rented out, chances are tax must be paid on the rental income, both Kelly and Ingram said.</p>
<p>While owners may be tempted not to pay the tax, Kelly recommends against it. If you don't pay and the government finds out, you will have to go through a hearing and the government could put a lien on the property.</p>
<p>"So it's better to be safe than sorry," Kelly said.</p>
<p>Don't forget about visa requirements to stay in the country where you buy, Ingram said. While no visa is needed for the U.S., if you stay too long you may have to pay tax on your worldwide income. And if you're not careful, you may lose your entitlement to B.C.'s medical services plan, which requires residents to be physically present in the province for at least six months of the year.</p>
<p>"So get proper advice" before you buy, Ingram advises.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Surge in flu cases prompts warning; British hospitals told to brace for up to 360,000 patients and 65,000 deaths</b>
</div><div>Kate Devlin </div>
<div>Daily Telegraph</div>
<div>632 words</div><div>17 July 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final C</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun </div>
</p>
<p>Britons have been told to prepare themselves for up to 65,000 death this winter as swine flu cases have suddenly soared in the island nation.</p>
<p>So far, 29 people have died from the flu, known as H1N1, but the numbers of sick are putting pressure on the country's National Health Service.</p>
<p>In the past week, an estimated 55,000 people have come down with the virus, with 652 being treated in hospital, many wards full of children, and 53 patients in a critical condition.</p>
<p>Some doctors are seeing up to 60 cases of H1N1 every day, with one in nine people in the country predicted to be infected by the end of next month.</p>
<p>The number of deaths doubled in a week -- last Friday just 14 people were known to have died in Britain from H1N1.</p>
<p>Liam Donaldson, the nation's chief medical officer, has told the health service to plan for the possibility of up to 65,000 deaths from the disease this winter -- although he said as few as 19,000 deaths could occur.</p>
<p>A national flu helpline will be set up within seven days to diagnose the condition and give out antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu. It will be staffed by 2,000 to 5,000 people with no medical training, in an effort to ease pressure on doctors and other health workers.</p>
<p>People working on the new telephone helpline will diagnose patients using a series of questions, and issue a personal</p>
<p>reference number for antiviral medication, which can be picked up by a "flu friend" from a local collection centre. The centres, which are beginning to be set up, will be away from GPs' surgeries to avoid contamination.</p>
<p>The swine flu outbreak could also cause the economy to</p>
<p>contract by as much as five per cent, according to economists from the Oxford Economics consultancy in a report to be published today. That's because one in eight of the national workforce could be off sick at the flu's winter peak.</p>
<p>That has prompted police chiefs to warn the pandemic poses a more serious threat to Britain than terrorism.</p>
<p>A set of "planning assumptions" has been given to the health service to ensure that hospitals, clinics and medical staff are ready if the worst transpires.</p>
<p>Under those assumptions, up to one-third of the population could be infected this winter. Up to half of all children could be infected during the first major wave of the pandemic, Donaldson said.</p>
<p>Hospitals will be expected to ensure that plans are in place to deal with up to 360,000 patients who need hospital treatment, of which 90,000 could need critical care. The last two outbreaks of pandemic flu in Britain -- in 1958 and between 1968 and 1970 -- both killed around 30,000 people.</p>
<p>A normal flu season will kill between 6,000 and 10,000 people, many of them elderly.</p>
<p>Donaldson insisted the figures for the number of H1N1 deaths were not "predictions" but worst case scenarios that the health service should plan to deal with.</p>
<p>He said: "We haven't had enough cases to even give ballpark figures of estimates."</p>
<p>Central London is the most severely affected part of Britain.</p>
<p>Young children are those most likely to be admitted to hospital, figures show. They were described as "super spreaders" of the disease. In the West Midlands alone two hospital wards have been dedicated to treating children with the disease.</p>

</p>
<p>It seems celebrity skin is just as susceptible to swine flu as everyone else's.</p>
<p>Former Hole and Smashing Pumpkins bassist Melissa Auf der Maur says she's recovering from a bout with the H1N1 influenza strain.</p>
<p>"It turns out that, somewhere between a video shoot in Vermont, a heavy metal concert in London, and my own musical showcase in Toronto, I had indeed fallen victim to a world pandemic," the Montreal-born Auf der Maur wrote in a first-person account at online magazine The Mark.</p>
<p>Over in Britain, Cherie Blair, the wife of former prime minister Tony Blair, pulled out of a ceremony at Liverpool Hope University, where she was to be honoured, because she has suspected swine flu, the BBC reported.</p>
<p>The barrister was to receive an honorary degree for her work in human rights and her support of the university.</p>
<p>While Blair's office would not comment on whether she had taken antiviral drugs for swine flu, Auf der Maur was forthcoming about the treatment she took.</p>
<p>"I am now officially on the mend - thanks to a combination of naturopathic treatments and heavy-duty antibiotics, among other survival tools," she wrote.</p>
<p>She says she initially started feeling symptoms in May, suffering from a stuffy nose, sore throat and body aches.</p>
<p>"But they came all at once, and were far more intense than I had ever experienced," wrote Auf der Maur, 37, who spent five years in Hole and played on the 1998 album Celebrity Skin.</p>
<p>"For a person who only gets ill once or twice a decade, it was scary."</p>

</p>
<p>Developer Steve Gupta is opening hotels across the Greater Toronto Area at a furious rate.</p>
<p>That makes him either the most foolhardy hotelier in the city, or possibly the smartest.</p>
<p>Gupta is charging ahead despite a recession that has hurt business travel. Then there's the strong Canadian dollar and new passport regulations that have torpedoed American tourist traffic. And did we mention the threat of swine flu?</p>
<p>"I'm an optimist," Gupta says. "I really feel that the economy will turn around, that people will start travelling again."</p>
<p>Gupta has bet big in the past, but not like this. At the end of July he will re-launch his Comfort Inn on Jarvis St. into a Hilton property after a $4 million renovation. In April he unveiled his $60 million Hilton Garden Inn in the downtown entertainment district. By the end of this year he will have built two more hotels, with others slated for completion next year.</p>
<p>Gupta is building so many properties that the former math major is momentarily stumped when asked how many rooms he owns.</p>
<p>He scribbles on a piece of paper in the dark wood panelled lobby of his two-year-old Marriott hotel on Wellington St. "It's probably 1,600. Or wait, it's closer to 1,700," he says. In all, Gupta has nine properties, with five under development.</p>
<p>Given the state of the economy, that would make him a very brave man. Actually, those are the words his engineer uses during a tour of his Jarvis St. property. Tiles are still being laid in the lobby; cables hang from the roof.</p>
<p>"He is so brave. Very brave. Look what he's doing. In a recession too. Very brave," the deferential employee says.</p>
<p>According to a survey by Colliers International Hotels and HLT Advisory, hoteliers think 2009 is pretty much a write-off. "Hotels are increasingly competing by slashing rates, often initiated by one hotel forcing others to follow," says Bill Stone, executive managing director of Colliers.</p>
<p>Room prices and occupancy rates are down significantly. At the end of May, occupancy levels were down to 57 per cent in the GTA, a drop of 7 percentage points from a year earlier. The average daily room rate was $125.83, down 8 per cent from last year.</p>
<p>Gupta has heard it all before. But he doesn't intend his privately held, Markham-based Easton's Group of Companies to become another statistic.</p>
<p>He has forced the naysayers to eat crow before. When he opened his Comfort Inn on Jarvis in 2000, right beside a strip joint in one of the city's seedier areas, they said he would fail spectacularly.</p>
<p>He built an elegant grey building that looked a lot like his palatial home on the Bridle Path. That property went on to have some of the highest occupancies in the city.</p>
<p>"Steve pays an incredible amount of attention to detail, and many times he goes above and beyond what the brands are asking for," says Michael Beckley, vice-president of development for Marriott Canada. "That sometimes includes us, and we are just about the toughest on standards anywhere."</p>
<p>Gupta has three Marriott-branded properties with two more scheduled to open next year, in Kingston and Vaughan.</p>
<p>This time he's fighting the toughest recession in decades. Gupta is discounting his rooms an average of 15-20 per cent. But he is intent on holding the line and you won't find his hotels on discount websites.</p>
<p>"Some places are going 50 per cent, but I think that is unsustainable, and it's hard to get your rates back up again," he says.</p>
<p>It's also tougher to get credit. Gupta had to come up with about half the $60 million cost for his recently launched hotel before he could get financing. A year earlier, banks would have been okay with 30 per cent down.</p>
<p>"The question is when do you do it, when you're really busy, or less busy?</p>
<p>"You do it when business is down and construction costs are lower so you can prepare for the upswing," he says.</p>
<p>Gupta lives for the numbers. He says that when he first arrived in Canada from India in 1971 he had $108. He remembers how much he paid in rent: $10 a week at a rooming house on Bathurst St.</p>
<p>After a variety of jobs from machine operator to insurance agent, he got into real estate. He financed a gas station on Hwy. 401 after gambling the property would become a major hub.</p>
<p>Today his privately held company includes apartment buildings, fast-food restaurants and hotels. Easton's has partnered with brands including Marriott and Hilton for what have traditionally been called limited-service hotels - essentially well-priced, newer hotels with fewer amenities.</p>
<p>But Gupta's version of "limited service" gives the full-service guys a run for their money. His new Hilton Garden Inn has valet parking. There is 24-hour room service and a pool. Plus granite everywhere is a Gupta signature.</p>
<p>The rooms are far from utilitarian. Some have Jacuzzi tubs in the middle; others have showers with multiple heads.</p>
<p>Then there are the hospital-grade beds. Gupta points to a knob on one of his beds that can adjust the firmness. The bed costs about $1,000 wholesale, he says, compared with about $250 for standard beds.</p>
<p>"These are small touches, but I think people really notice," he says.</p>
<p>No detail is too small for Gupta: he recently scrapped newly ordered wallpaper at his hotel on Jarvis St. at a cost of $20,000 because he thought it would be too dark.</p>
<p>His business has always been a family affair. Wife Rashmi runs the Markham office. Eldest daughter Reema is the company's director of operations.</p>
<p>The hotel community still talks about the million-dollar, two-day wedding in 2004 that the Guptas threw for Reema at the Sheraton Centre. Attended by almost 1,000 guests, the groom arrived on a horse accompanied by a marching band along Queen St.</p>
<p>When he's ready to start building, Gupta will typically bring materials home from work and lay out samples as family assembles to complete the hotel business's most unique focus group.</p>
<p>"It could be anything, faucets, door handles, carpets, we all get a say," daughter Reetu says.</p>
<p>"If we get into a dispute we'll jump into the car and go look at it in the hotel."</p>
<p>Now Gupta dreams of expanding beyond Canada. A project in the United States, perhaps.</p>
<p>"That can definitely happen," he says, his eyes brightening.</p>
<p>"Don't be surprised."</p>

</p>
<p>MUSKOKA -- Canada's most renowned cancer camp has cancelled its annual open house next week as a precaution to protect medically vulnerable children from the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Officials at Camp Oochigeas in Rosseau have also stepped up screening for flu-like symptoms, checking campers and volunteers before they get on the bus, said executive director Rob Drynan.</p>
<p>Visitors are being screened for flu-like symptoms 48 hours before coming to camp. Even a hint of fever, coughing, sore throat, muscle ache, joint pain or weakness means they'll have to reschedule.</p>
<p>The same holds true for campers and volunteers, Drynan said.</p>
<p>"We know people would never want to put our kids in jeopardy by coming into camp with something," he added. "We're a pretty closed camp and don't have too many visitors. So if it doesn't come up on the bus, it doesn't come in."</p>
<p>Any campers who develop fever are sent home to protect the others, some of whom are being treated for cancer while at camp.</p>
<p>Oochigeas also has a highly trained team of doctors and nurses from Toronto's Sick Kids hospital on site 24/7. Anyone presenting flu-like symptoms would be isolated. Should a case of flu be confirmed, Drynan said the camp would be shut down. "Camp is community living and we have to be cautious."</p>
<p>Sunday's open house at Camp Ekon on Lake Joseph will go ahead, but those feeling under the weather are being asked to stay home, director Meg Doherty said. All visitors to the camp - which includes children from low-income families and those with special needs - will be screened before being allowed on the property.</p>
<p>Campers are screened by nurses to make sure kids are in good health, Doherty said.</p>
<p>As part of the process, they're asked a series of questions about their health, including whether they've travelled to areas where they may have been exposed to H1N1.</p>
<p>Doherty said handwashing and sanitizing are required after every activity and bunkmates are sleeping with heads pointed in opposite directions. Those with special needs visit camp nurses daily and their health is closely monitored.</p>
<p>No one at Ekon has been sick and anyone with symptoms would be quarantined "and we would seek outside medical attention," Doherty said.</p>
<p>A plan is also in place at Camp Awakening, for boys with a range of physical disabilities, including spina bifida and muscular dystrophy.</p>
<p>Program director Julien Fergus said all campers received a clean bill of health from Toronto's Bloorview Children's Rehab Centre before attending camp. Once there, handwashing and sanitizing is obligatory throughout the day and before meals. "We're also keeping the boys well hydrated," he said.</p>
<p>At Newport Adventure Camp, part of the Ontario Camping Ministry of the Salvation Army outside Huntsville, a volunteer spends the day disinfecting washrooms and portable toilets, as well as door handles and hard surfaces, said Capt. Neil Sunnuck.</p>
<p>Campers and visitors to Mini-Yo-We must also answer a questionnaire that asks about coughs, fever, nausea, and aches and pains.</p>
<p>No cases of the H1N1 virus have been reported at any of these camps.</p>

<p>Until this spring, <span class="companylink">Scorpio Mining Corp</span>., which runs its business in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, focused its emergency planning on mining disruptions rather than pandemics.</p>
<p>That all changed in early May, when a Mexican presidential decree asked businesses to temporarily close to contain the swine flu outbreak. The Val-d'Or, Que.-based miner shut operations in a remote corner of the state of Sinaloa for six days and used that time to make a new contingency plan.</p>
<p>“We had plans if we had a cave-in or something like that, but I don't think we ever realized we could have a pandemic. Now, we have a plan,” said spokesman Richard Kaiser, adding that the company has not had any incidences of swine flu.</p>
<p>Employers are scrambling to plan for a scenario that could see half their work force absent, supply chains disrupted and customers vanish.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean they're ready yet: 87 per cent of Canadian companies still don't have a contingency plan to deal with a situation like a pandemic, a Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters survey found in April.</p>
<p>Many managers mired in this recession are more preoccupied with immediate financial challenges than what they view as distant hypotheticals, CME spokesman Jeff Brownlee said of the survey result, which was based on 527 company responses in manufacturing and other sectors.</p>
<p>“It was not a surprise to us. Canadian businesses are facing a tsunami of challenges right now – the currency, financial meltdown, making payrolls – [swine flu] is just not right up front and centre because it's a ‘what if.'”</p>
<p>Many employers have been lulled into a false sense of security because initial swine flu cases have been mild, said Diane Champagne, Mercer's Montreal-based national leader for health and productivity. She saw a torrent of requests for pandemic planning advice this spring, which have since tapered off this summer.</p>
<p>Large Canadian employers such as banks are generally prepared for a pandemic, says Mario Possamai, a Toronto-based consultant who specializes in critical incidents and was a senior adviser to the SARS Commission, which investigated Ontario's response to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome.</p>
<p>But small and medium-sized enterprises? Less so.</p>
<p>“I'm worried about them, that they may not be ready. A lot of the ones I've spoken with think it's overblown, and they think the media's hyped it,” said Mr. Possamai, who has spent recent months evaluating companies' plans.</p>
<p>“My advice to them is that it may not be as severe as data may suggest, but preparing for this will help you prepare for a lot of other things, such as ice storms.”</p>
<p>He suggests various steps companies should take, such as establishing a pandemic committee, putting procedures in place for telecommuting and video-conferencing, placing hand sanitizers at business entrances and displaying posters on good hygiene in the workplace.</p>
<p>As concerns about the severity of swine flu ebb and flow, some businesses are keeping their guard up. <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> has several internal groups dedicated to keeping on top of the latest developments. These groups work under the direction of the bank's chief medical officer.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Transat A.T. Inc</span>., Canada's largest tour holiday operator, has hired a doctor to regularly brief the company and has dedicated staff to monitor the outbreak. Its contingency plan predates the current flu outbreak, though Montreal-based spokesman Pierre Tessier says that plan is constantly tweaked.</p>
<p>“We're always trying to improve it and making adjustments.”</p>
<p>How concerned should employers be at this point? The Public Health Agency of Canada suggests businesses should plan for one-third to half of their workers being absent for about two weeks at the height of a severe pandemic.</p>
<p>The price tag in lost productivity and business interruptions could exceed the $2-billion hit the economy took thanks to SARS, says Amin Mawani, director of the Health Industry Management Program at the Schulich School of Business at York University.</p>
<p>He views pandemic planning as insurance: All companies buy fire insurance, even though the likelihood of a fire is 1.8 per cent for every 100,000 square feet of space, he says.</p>
<p>The likelihood of a pandemic is at least 8 per cent, according to the World Economic Forum.</p>
<p>“You won't find a single company without fire insurance, and yet here's another threat where there's an 8-per-cent chance your employees will be absent and disrupt profits.</p>
<p>“Most banks insist on fire insurance as a condition for a business loan. Maybe they should insist on a pandemic plan as well.”</p>

<div>DVDS / THIS WEEK / CORALINE</div>
<div>The Globe Review Column</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Here's why 1/24 of a second can make animators weep</b>
</div><div>WARREN CLEMENTS </div>
<div>1126 words</div><div>17 July 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>R22</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

<p>Coraline (2009) is a wonderful, magical movie. You might assume that a behind-the-scenes look at how it was made would sap the film of that magic, but the opposite is true. Seeing the mind-boggling degree of finicky work and patience required to manipulate tiny puppets and create tiny groceries and sweaters for this tiny world makes the result all the more awe-inspiring. That's it; I've run out of superlatives. On with the show.</p>
<p>Even before Neil Gaiman had finished writing his short book about a little girl who moves with her parents to a secluded rooming house, screenwriter-director Henry Selick had read the draft and asked to make the film. As he had with The Nightmare Before Christmas, Selick chose to create Coraline's world through stop-motion animation – real objects on real, miniature sets, moved a fraction of an inch one frame at a time, for a film projected at 24 frames per second. Selick says he tried imagining other ways to make it, but computer animation had too slick a feel to it and, what with the talking cat and all, live action would have been clumsy.</p>
<p>As the film opens, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is lonely and frustrated. Her parents are so obsessed with writing a gardening catalogue that they won't even create a garden with her. The only child in the area is Wybie, a friendly but odd little guy (who wasn't in the book). The Eastern European neighbour upstairs, an acrobat called Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane), is eccentric; the two faded British actresses downstairs (Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders) are eccentric. But eccentricity doesn't fill the void, so, when Coraline finds the key to a tiny door in the house (hello, Alice in Wonderland), she follows the path to a mirror image of her world. The difference is, her “other” mother and father in that “other” world have buttons for eyes, are attentive and lots of fun, and excel at cooking.</p>
<p>Too good to be true? Definitely. The doll that Wybie gives Coraline is not all it appears to be, and Wybie's grandmother is right to be suspicious of the house after her twin sister disappeared there many years ago.</p>
<p>In the 70-minute behind-the-scenes feature on the two-disc collector's edition DVD, artists painstakingly fold every magically budding flower in the “other” world and set it in place. The faces of the fully poseable silicone-coated puppets are broken into upper and lower halves, with dozens of replacements as the characters' expressions warrant. Coraline's blue hair is made of electrical wire styled with tweezers, glue and medical scissors. The animators have to manipulate fingers, arms, faces, bodies and backgrounds, often wrestling with mechanical rigs to place characters up in the air, all to achieve just one-24th of a second up on screen. “If the shot's really good,” says lead animator Travis Knight, “you can bet there's an animator lying on the floor somewhere huddled up in a ball, probably weeping.”</p>
<p>The DVD includes both the 2-D and 3-D versions of the movie, and four pairs of cardboard 3-D glasses, which aren't the easiest thing to wear with prescription glasses. There are a few ghost images in the 3-D version (appropriate, in a way), but there's a genuine sense of depth.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>MOVIES</p>
<p>Pontypool (2009)</p>
<p>Forget swine flu. Director Bruce McDonald and writer Tony Burgess, adapting his novel Pontypool Changes Everything, imagine a small town caught in the grip of a virus that's somehow connected with language. Radio host Grant Mazzy (a terrific job by Stephen McHattie) and his co-workers (Lisa Houle, Georgina Reilly) report on the growing zombie-like violence outside their walls, with much black humour. Bonuses include an hour-long CBC radio drama with the same cast, accompanied by stills from the movie.</p>
<p>Moscow, Belgium (2008)</p>
<p>This Flemish-language film from Belgium has nothing to do with Russia; Moscow is a blue-collar neighbourhood in Flanders. Matty (Barbara Sarafian) is a 41-year-old postal worker with three children, a husband who went off with a much younger woman, and a new complication when she starts having sex with a 29-year-old truck driver who has a temper and a history of abuse. It sounds grim, but Christophe van Rompaiey's film mines the romantic possibilities.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>TV</p>
<p>Charlie's Angels: The</p>
<p>Complete Fourth Season (1979-80)</p>
<p>I'm not saying Charlie (the voice of John Forsythe) was a bad employer, but his crime-fighting Angels had a high turnover rate. Farrah Fawcett-Majors (as she then was) left after the first season, and Kate Jackson left after the third. The sole original Angel, Jaclyn Smith, teams up here with Cheryl Ladd and Shelley Hack. The late Farrah (Fawcett), who worked off a breach-of-contract suit by appearing in six episodes in the third season, returns for three more.</p>
<p>Arthur Hailey's Hotel: The First Season (1983-84)</p>
<p>Based on Hailey's novel Hotel, this parade of human drama takes its cue from the line in 1932's Grand Hotel that “people come, people go.” The hotel manager (James Brolin) and staff remain constant, while guest stars such as Shirley Jones and Stewart Granger create complications. Bette Davis starred as the hotel owner in the pilot episode (included here), but afterward fell ill and was replaced by Anne Baxter, who, coincidentally, played Davis's scheming successor in All About Eve.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>BLU-RAY</p>
<p>Watchmen: Director's Cut (2009)</p>
<p>The year is 1985, but Richard Nixon is still presidt, nuclear war is brewing and someone may be picking off retired costumed superheroes. (“One of us died tonight. Someone knows why.”) Welcome to the dark world of Alan Moore, co-creator of the influential graphic novel on which this is based, though he spurned a film credit because he considers his work unfilmable. Director Zack Snyder did a good job, and adds another 25 minutes to this version. Bonuses include a comparison of novel and film.</p>
<p>300 (2006)</p>
<p>Subtitled “the Complete Experience,” this new edition of the film about King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and 300 Spartans taking on the Persians remains a visually impressive pageant of rippling muscles and bloody battles. Director Zack Snyder (yes, him again) introduces an absorbing trio of picture-in-picture tracks about Frank Miller, whose graphic novel this came from; the filming of warriors in front of blue screens, details to be added later; and Spartan history. Hours of browsing if you're up for them.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Airlines scramble to lure customers; Declines in demand; WestJet, Air Canada offer deep discounts on selected routes</b>
</div><div>Scott Deveau </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>506 words</div><div>17 July 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>FP2</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>The International Air Transport Association has reversed its somewhat optimistic prediction last month that declines in the demand for air travel may have bottomed, saying yesterday that the total number of people flying fell the most so far this year in May.</p>
<p>Moreover, confidence has also slipped among IATA members and many carriers do not expect conditions to improve until year-end -- at the earliest.</p>
<p>"Passenger travel numbers in May cast doubt on the view that a bottom to the travel decline has been reached," IATA said in its quarterly business confidence survey yesterday, adding the overall number of travellers flying fell 9.2% during the month. "There are some promising signs but passenger numbers were still falling."</p>
<p>In Canada, this has carriers offering up deep discounts in order to get people travelling. Earlier this week, WestJet was offering flights in the Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal corridor for $9, which was followed yesterday by a one-week sale offering 50% discounts on all of its flights this fall.</p>
<p>Chris Avery, WestJet vice-president of revenue and planning, acknowledged the discounting is aimed at getting people flying again.</p>
<p>"[The pricing environment] is still reasonably aggressive," he said. "You can't deny that there is diminished demand in the airline sector."</p>
<p>In fact, IATA said all airlines surveyed were suffering through the same sort of pricing declines with half saying they expect yields to fall further this year.</p>
<p>While cuts to fuel surcharges, the impact of swine flu and downgrades to economy class have all contributed, the primary concern has been a glut of excess capacity. Capacity cuts have come at about half the rate of the declining traffic trend, putting pressure on prices, IATA said.</p>
<p>WestJet has accused Air Canada, which is trying to fend off a bankruptcy, of acting irrationally by drastically dropping fares. But, in fact, both carriers are guilty of doing it.</p>
<p>Since the start of the second quarter, Air Canada's average domestic ticket price has fallen by 17% compared with last year while WestJet's has fallen by 13%, according to a random sampling of fares by National Bank Financial.</p>
<p>WestJet has, however, maintained its guidance this month that revenue per available seat mile [RASM] -- a measure of how much money the airline collects on average per available seat --for the second quarter will fall between 16% and 18% this year compared with last.</p>
<p>"We believe WestJet's commentary is relevant for Air Canada and is consistent with our (admittedly unscientific) tracking of fares," said David Newman, National Bank Financial analyst, in a recent note to clients.</p>
<p>Mr. Newman is reviewing his second-quarter earnings estimate for Air Canada based on his lower RASM estimates, but says he expects West-Jet to report earnings of 2¢ a share for the three months ending June 30, down from 23¢ last year, due primarily to the pricing pressure.</p>

</div><div>Tamara Gignac </div>

</p>
<p>I t's been a chilly start to the summer for Alberta's tourism industry--and not only because of the weather.</p>
<p>Skittish Japanese and British travellers are putting off overseas holiday plans and tourism officials say it hasn't been this difficult to attract foreign visitors to the province since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States and the global SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>"We're battling hard," said Kurt Schroeder, director of sales and market development with Banff Lake Louise Tourism.</p>
<p>"There's no denying we're in one of the most challenging years we've had in many."</p>
<p>A triple threat of swine flu fears, economic woes and new passport U. S. restrictions has made it challenging to fill hotels, restaurants and buses with international tourists during the region's peak summer season, a period that normally sees three million visitors.</p>
<p>A Statistics Canada report released Thursday suggests travel from overseas countries declined 7.8 per cent across the country in May.</p>
<p>Japan--at 34.6 per cent-- recorded the biggest drop, followed by the United Kingdom at 14.2 per cent and Mexico at 14.1 per cent.</p>
<p>A similar trend has continued into the summer, industry officials say. The economy is one big reason fewer Japanese travellers are planning holidays in Alberta. Another is what Schroeder refers to as the "P-word:" pandemic.</p>
<p>"H1N1 has probably had the single, largest impact. We saw it with SARS--it's an almost instantaneous, knee jerk reaction," he said.</p>
<p>At Rocks and Gems on Banff Avenue, the store is often filled with Japanese tourists keen to take ammolite jewelry home as gifts and souvenirs.</p>
<p>Business has been much quieter this summer, reports store manager Sheri Whitaker. "We're down 14 per cent over last year and those that are here are not buying like they used to," she said.</p>
<p>It's a similar refrain for Calgary hotels. Occupancies are better than expected this summer, mostly because leisure travellers from British Columbia and Saskatchewan have filled the void of foreign guests.</p>
<p>"We're definitely seeing a lot fewer (international) travellers," said Calgary Hotel Association president Joseph Clohessy.</p>
<p>"It was noticeable during the Stampede, when there were more Canadians out there instead."</p>
<p>Clohessy accepts that health fears and money concerns are big factors, but also points to airline cutbacks, which has resulted in some routes between Canada and Asian markets minimized or cancelled completely.</p>
<p>The numbers are not all bleak, according to the Alberta government. Recent figures suggest the number of U. S. visitors rose 0.3 per cent in the province for the first five months of 2009, even as the rest of the country saw a decline in American traffic.</p>
<p>The U. S. has since introduced new passport requirements at border crossings, which could put a chill on summer travel north of the border. However, Tourism Minister Cindy Ady said the statistics are still something to celebrate.</p>
<p>"Just look at the Stampede. This would have been a record year if it hadn't rained for seven of the 10 days," Ady said.</p>
<p>"That being said, we do have concerns about our overseas markets. The Japanese and European markets are very important to us."</p>
<p>Industry observers fear Alberta's tourism industry could take another hit in response to new Visa requirements for Mexican citizens.</p>
<p>Visitors from the Spanish-speaking country spent more than $20.4 million in the province in 2007. However, future travellers may now opt to scrap their Rocky Mountain holiday plans in favour of a more "friendly" destination, said J. R. Brent Ritchie, a tourism professor at the University Calgary's Haskayne School of Business.</p>
<p>"I think it's going to be perceived as a put-down of Mexico," said Ritchie.</p>
<p>"There's been a good relationship for years, a lot of Canadian tourists go down there. Now it's a case of, 'you're not treating us like good friends.' "</p>
<p>Some 342,000 travellers visited Canada in May. Just over a million Americans took overnight trips to Canada during the month, down two per cent from April, while Canadians took nearly 3.3 million trips to the U. S. an increase of 1.2 per cent.</p>

<p>Very elderly seniors are living in "holding cells," the health minister is "talking gibberish," and Premier Ed Stelmach doesn't want a cabinet minister "who graduated from Harvard with Barack Obama."</p>
<p>That's the latest--and maybe the last--from Fort McMurray MLA Guy Boutilier. His remarkable musings about health care have brought him to the verge of ejection from Stelmach's caucus.</p>
<p>Boutilier, a cabinet minister in Ralph Klein's day, has been upset for months about postponement of a long-term care centre for Fort McMurray. Many government MLAs are equally uneasy as local health projects are shelved pending a health board review.</p>
<p>But so far they've dutifully taken the heat in their ridings, while Boutilier is taking the extremely rare step of speaking out critically.</p>
<p>To Stelmach he's becoming a political version of swine flu. If this spreads, the premier will have to quarantine half his caucus.</p>
<p>The blow-up began in April, when Ron Liepert signalled postponement of the care centre Stelmach himself announced in 2008.</p>
<p>Boutilier blasted Liepert after the health minister said "the urgent need wasn't there," implying that the city has a young population.</p>
<p>"That was talking gibberish and it's simply not accurate information," he said in an interview Thursday.</p>
<p>"If it's a very young population, what shall I tell the people over 85 who are in the holding cells?What else can you call them?"</p>
<p>Those "cells" are on the 4th floor of the Northern Lights hospital, home to 31 seniors, including one who's 98.</p>
<p>But provincial officials say that floor is a fully staffed, dedicated long-term care area within the hospital.</p>
<p>"We should have stuck with the strategy we settled on before the last election. This is a mistake, and I told Ron Liepert that in caucus.</p>
<p>"What MLAs are hearing in coffee shops is very different from what the minister is hearing from health officials."</p>
<p>Boutilier figures Liepert is well-meaning but misinformed. "Ron, you don't know what you're talking about. Bring me any health official and I'll debate the issue."</p>
<p>Boutilier also wants a lively provincial debate about health care. That brings us to the surprising subject of President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>"I graduated from Harvard with Obama in 1991," says Boutilier. "I didn't really know him. . . . But we need to elevate discussion in Alberta on public issues such as health care. Obama is doing it now in America. We need more of that in Alberta."</p>
<p>Asked about his earlier demotion from cabinet, Boutilier says, "If the premier doesn't want to have a guy who graduated from Harvard with Barack Obama, that's fine."</p>
<p>Despite saying all this, Boutilier seems genuinely shocked by the suggestion that he might be disciplined.</p>
<p>"What would the premier do if this was happening in Vegreville? Would he write a letter saying he's happy with the decision? I don't think so. . . . I'm doing what he wants us to do--representing our communities. I have respect for the process, but I haven't done anything wrong. I have only said this is a bad decision.</p>
<p>"What am I supposed to do--lie?"</p>
<p>At the legislature, Boutilier's record is being quietly dusted off. There are whispers about his spotty caucus attendance, and hints that as a Treasury Board member, he's putting himself in conflict with official policy.</p>
<p>Yes, Guy Boutilier could well get himself kicked out of Toryland; but at least he'll sail out in a blaze of Northern Lights.</p>

<p>The Liberal Party accused Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq yesterday of lacking leadership on the swine flu file and challenged the government to be more open with Canadians about the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Ontario MP Carolyn Bennett, the party's health critic, sent a letter on behalf of the Liberal caucus to Aglukkaq, in which she says she is concerned over the health minister's "silence on the federal government's preparedness" for the spread of the swine flu virus, also known as H1N1.</p>
<p>The virus was expected to wane during the summer months, but so far it's still making its presence strongly known. This week, several summer camps in Ontario proved to be breeding grounds for the flu - 230 children and 77 staff at three separate camps in the Muskoka region came down with the virus and six other camps are under investigation.</p>
<p>Nationwide, swine flu has been confirmed in more than 10,000 people and has been connected to 45 deaths.</p>
<p>"Despite this threat, I do not see clear public leadership from you to ensure that all Canadians have the necessary information and resources to protect themselves against the spread of H1N1," Bennett wrote to the health minister. "In my meetings with health officials from across the country over the course of the past several weeks, the message has been the same: The federal government is invisible on this urgent issue."</p>
<p>Bennett, who was travelling yesterday and not available for an interview to further explain her concerns, said her party wants to see a public-awareness campaign that goes beyond the one already launched by the Public Health Agency of Canada. She also wants hand sanitizers installed in houses with no running water in aboriginal communities and the establishment of a working group to identify communities that are least prepared to deal with a swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>The letter also suggested Dr. David Butler-Jones, the chief public health officer, is being muzzled. It asked that he be allowed to "speak regularly and directly to Canadians without political interference."</p>
<p>At the beginning of the outbreak in April, Butler-Jones and Aglukkaq held almost daily media briefings, which are now more intermittent but are still occurring about once a week.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canadian hospitals are not prepared for pandemic; Our swine-flu plans do not allocate enough money for beds with ventilators</b>
</div><div>JARO KOTALIK   </div>
<div>Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>864 words</div><div>17 July 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>While we continue to observe a daily increase in the number of swine flu cases across the country, we take comfort in the fact that our country has been preparing for a pandemic for years. We have an elaborate, expertly produced national pandemic plan, which in turn gave rise to provincial, territorial, regional and local plans. Canada has even been called a world leader in pandemic preparedness by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>But there is an inherent weakness in our pandemic planning, a weakness that greatly undermines all the effort put into this enterprise, a weakness that might in the end be fatal.</p>
<p>In 2004, a Canadian pandemic plan was released that did not say a word about the amount of material and human resources that would be required for each of the hundreds of proposed pandemic measures nor about who would provide these resources. When you stop to think about it, it's almost unbelievable: The largest public health program ever proposed was launched without any budget or money.</p>
<p>True, in 2006 the federal budget earmarked $1 billion over five years for this cause. Three years into this budget, we know that the federal government purchased stocks of the antiviral drug Tamiflu and contracted for the production of a vaccine. However, these actions, while important, are far from meeting all the essential requirements. To date, none of the budgeted money seems to have made its way to the front lines where the real war against the pandemic will largely be fought, such as the hospitals I am associated with.</p>
<p>This economic blind-eye approach has resulted in our lack of readiness to care for those sick with the flu. The sudden emergence of an enormous number of sick people is the hallmark of a pandemic. The national plan for a moderate pandemic estimates that of 4.9 million people who will become ill, 109,000 people, about two per cent, will need to be admitted to a hospital. The plan does not suggest how these additional patients could be accommodated given that in Canada we have just over 100,000 beds and that they are full 90 per cent of the time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it now appears that the demand for hospital beds might be much higher than our experts predicted. On June 12, the Public Health Agency of Canada reported that not two per cent, but five per cent of confirmed cases of pandemic flu had to be hospitalized. And not any kind of hospital bed will suffice.</p>
<p>Because the most frequent serious complication of any flu is pneumonia, and in some cases the inability to breathe, these flu patients will require mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit. This fact was foreseeable, and it is well known that beds with ventilators are constantly in short supply, yet no provisions were made to at least partially remedy the shortage.</p>
<p>It now appears that at the peak of demand, pandemic flu patients might need almost twice as many beds with ventilators as are currently being used for all patients. To date, no relief of the shortage has been proposed.</p>
<p>A recent situation in Winnipeg highlighted how ill-prepared our hospitals are. In mid-June, at the very beginning of the H1N1 flu outbreak, when the province had only 119 confirmed cases, 31 of them needed ventilators. Winnipeg hospitals cancelled non-urgent surgery, discharged patients earlier and ordered 15 more ventilators.</p>
<p>The health-care-delivery system in Canada is stretched to its limits. Wherever you are, at this very moment there is probably a "discharge planner" going around your local hospital trying to determine which patients could be sent home, because unless someone is discharged, it is not possible to get a bed for a patient waiting for admission. Under these circumstances, how can hospitals engage in serious preparation for increased demand?</p>
<p>So all of us are closing our eyes to the unpleasant reality and hoping that, somehow, we will get through this.</p>
<p>I have recommended to our hospital that we should determine what resources we need to provide care at the height of the pandemic to all patients who can be reasonably expected to rely on us. We should then notify our funding agency and include an estimate of the potential human cost of not having the necessary resources. If funding is not received, our hospital has an obligation to inform the public about the lack of resources.</p>
<p>If we fail to do this we will have an ethical responsibility for the harm or deaths that could have been prevented.</p>
<p>If given a choice, would Canadians want our health- care system to go through the pandemic, the largest threat to the health and life of Canadians in many decades, with no additional resources, scaling down care to what the regular budget provides? Or would they be prepared to pay for the best possible care, knowing that the deaths that will occur will be unavoidable?</p>

</p>
<p>Former prime minister Tony Blair's wife Cherie is suffering from suspected H1N1 (swine flu), her spokesman said Thursday, as Britain's death toll of people with the virus jumped to 29.</p>
<p>Blair, a barrister whose husband left Downing Street two years ago, pulled out of a ceremony at Liverpool Hope University, said its pro vice-chancellor, Bill Chambers.</p>
<p>"Cherie is a good friend of the university and our work," he told the BBC. "On this occasion, she had unfortunately had to withdraw, but we cannot comment further."</p>
<p>But a spokesman for Blair told the broadcaster: "She has had to cancel because of a suspected case of swine flu."</p>
<p>The spokesman was not immediately reachable.</p>
<p>Neither her husband --the Middle East Quartet envoy--nor her children have reported symptoms, the Press Association reported.</p>
<p>The former prime minister's office declined to comment.</p>
<p>Twentysix people have died in England and three in Scotland, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said Thursday, in a sharp increase in the death toll from 17 earlier this week.</p>
<p>Some 55,000 new cases were reported last week in Britain, the worst-hit country by the pandemic in Europe, the HPA added.</p>

</div><div>Susan Riley   </div>

</p>
<p>I cycled past a dead crow the other day and was hit by a powerful wave of nostalgia: whatever happened to the eco-scares of yesteryear, I wondered? Shouldn't we all be dead by now?</p>
<p>They used to be as reliable (and as hair-raising) as summer blockbusters at the local Cineplex -- horrifying tales of invasive foreign species that were undermining native ecology and, in the worst cases, threatening human life. These alarming forecasts arrived reliably every spring and, as far as I could tell, were largely spread by newspapers and television newscasts.</p>
<p>This year, nothing. Or hardly anything, another sign, perhaps, of the declining influence of print journalism. There is passing reference in a recent Globe and Mail story to a new "killer shrimp" -- the bloody red mysid, a tiny aquatic creature recently spotted in the Great Lakes, that is said to be "ravenous," and to "travel in packs." All the elements, in other words, of a great eco-scare: sinister "alien" origins, creepy name, prolific reproduction, insatiable appetite. Alas, Googling the words "killer shrimp" mostly turns up recipes from California seafood joints.</p>
<p>As for dead crows, they were associated with the 1999 discovery of West Nile virus in New York city -- Africa, apparently, being an inexhaustible wellspring of gruesome diseases. The virus was actually spread by mosquitoes, not crows, and it killed hundreds of people in the United States at its peak in 2003.</p>
<p>There were victims in Canada, too, although fatalities have been declining markedly. Indeed, four of five people bitten by infected mosquitoes experience no symptoms at all, a factoid usually relegated to the scare story's fine print. (Not that I'm suggesting these imported illness don't cause tragedy; just that their impact is invariably oversold.)</p>
<p>There are still occasional cases of West Nile reported -- and, anywhere there are mosquitoes, lingering concerns. The specific culprit -- the Culex tarsalis mosquito -- prefers hot weather, which hasn't been an issue this summer. "Often on a nice warm evening, just as you're finishing the soccer game, you notice mosquitoes biting your ankles -- that's often Culex tarsalis," Saskatchewan provincial entomologist Phil Curry explained. (An obvious precaution: wear socks.)</p>
<p>My favourite eco-scare --patient zero, perhaps, of the modern genre -- is killer bees. They were the product of a 1957 experiment gone-wrong in Brazil, when 26 aggressive African Queen bees escaped a research compound, mated with milder European bees, and began a relentless expansion north. En route, they swarmed Mexican farmhands, killed innocent pets and dominated headlines in the early '90s.</p>
<p>Since then, they have lost their sting -- stalled at the Louisiana border by cold winters, their reputation rehabilitated, somewhat, by selective breeding and a name-change. They are now called "Africanized bees" and lauded by beekeepers for their gentle nature. They are still creating a buzz, however, judging by the number of sports teams bearing the moniker Killer Bees.</p>
<p>The Great Lakes remains a cauldron of unwelcome visitors -- home, by some estimates, to at least 57 alien species. The most famous is the zebra mussel, still cutting swimmers' feet, clogging pipes and temporarily disabling nuclear power plants around Lake Ontario. The ugliest is the round goby, described as an extremely aggressive bottom-feeder that even eats zebra mussels. Because this frankenfish, with its buggy eyes and mottled colour, is prone to botulism, it can infect other unlucky species, including loons, that order goby for lunch.</p>
<p>Since 2006, freighters entering the Great Lakes have been required to flush their ballast, which is intended to slow or halt the introduction of non-native invaders -- although how any species can survive the industrial pollution in the Great Lakes is a scientific wonder in itself. Humans, after all, have done more damage than any hapless mollusk.</p>
<p>On land, the invasive purple loosestrife -- that vivid popsicle of colour waving brightly from every country ditch -- remains on the watch-list, despite the introduction of two leaf-eating beetles, a root-mining weevil and a seed weevil, intended to contain its spread. In Charlottetown, P.E.I., two women have been hired to dig up loosestrife along the city's Confederation Trail this summer.</p>
<p>The work is supported by the federal Invasive Alien Species Partnership, a program also helping Nova Scotia scientists and university students monitor the rugged coastline of Cape Breton. They are girding for a multi-pronged assault: watching for European green crab, Asian shore crab, Chinese mitten crab, Japanese skeleton shrimp, lacy crust bryozan, sea squirts, oyster thief or dead man's fingers, spineycreek crayfish and rock snot.</p>
<p>Maybe the media have exhausted the annual allotment of alarming headlines on the swine flu -- now menacing summer camps, faithful to any Hollywood script -- and the recession. But you'd think dead man's fingers would at least warrant a mention.</p>

<p>The letter also suggested Dr. David Butler-Jones, the chief public health officer, is being muzzled.</p>
<p>"The minister is disappointed in the comments," Aglukkaq's spokesman, Tim Vail, said. "The minister and the government have been open and transparent through this H1N1 pandemic."</p>

<p>The World Health Organization says countries should change the way they monitor the spread of H1N1 flu, moving away from counting of individual cases.</p>
<p>The Geneva-based agency says that type of surveillance is no longer needed in countries with established outbreaks and the work required for case-by-case counting is not sustainable.</p>
<p>The health organization says it won't be posting global case counts anymore, but will issue periodic updates on the state of the pandemic.</p>
<p>It is asking countries with established outbreaks to focus surveillance on information that would be more useful at this point, things like unusual clusters of severe or fatal infections or surges in emergency-department visits.</p>
<p>Those kinds of developments could signal changes in the disease pattern or a rise in the rate of infections in a community.</p>
<p>Countries that haven't yet seen cases or are still in the early days of their outbreaks are still being asked to report weekly estimates of case numbers and a description of the disease pattern being seen.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canada will have enough flu vaccines to share; Unique deal with supplier means Canadians will get the shot – and there will be excess supply for countries in need, health officer says</b>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Canadians will have a better chance of getting vaccinated against the pandemic influenza than people in many other countries, including the United States and Britain, thanks to nearly a decade of planning for the disease's arrival.</p>
<p>“We're actually in a fairly unique position of having domestic capacity, of having planned for that in Canada now for many years,” David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said in an interview with The Globe and Mail yesterday.</p>
<p>In 2001, the federal government began a 10-year agreement with a drug company that was eventually sold to <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>. That contract obligates the giant pharmaceutical manufacturer to provide vaccine to every Canadian who wants it in the event of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Canada was the first country in the world to sign such an agreement, and, in exchange, it has given the company money to expand the capacity of its plant at Ste-Foy, Que.</p>
<p>Ottawa devoted $1-billion in the 2006 federal budget toward pandemic planning and emergency preparedness. Dr. Butler-Jones said that measure and the vaccine deal will leave the Ste-Foy facility with enough excess supply to send to other countries, including the U.S., at the same time it is shipping the medicine to Canadians.</p>
<p>“Three or four years ago, we could fill about eight million doses a month,” said Dr. Butler-Jones. “Now it's up closer to 14 million. So, within a couple of months, we have enough vaccine essentially for everybody living in Canada to get at least one dose, which would probably be sufficient for most of us.”</p>
<p>More important, because the vaccine will be produced in Canada, Canadians will not have to fight other countries to guarantee their supply.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Britain are on much less solid ground, because they do not produce enough vaccine to meet their own needs. The U.S., for instance, has the ability to make just 20 per cent of its domestic requirements, and relies on European countries for the rest. And all of Britain's vaccines are made abroad.</p>
<p>It is possible that a country with vaccine production facilities, facing a pandemic, would insist that their own citizens get inoculated before any vaccine exits its borders. International contract law does not supersede any government's ability to stop goods from being exported.</p>
<p>Michael Osterholm, director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said that American fears of being left without a reliable supply of vaccine are very real.</p>
<p>“If there is widespread disease and it's serious in nature, we could very clearly see a situation [in] countries in Europe where the vaccine's manufacturer would not release it until all of their citizens are covered first,” Dr. Osterholm said.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama designated $1.825-billion (U.S.) yesterday for emergency use to fight the H1N1 pandemic. The money will be used to buy vaccine ingredients to help health officials plan for immunization campaigns and to help get vaccines approved.</p>
<p>But no amount of money will ensure that a vaccine will be available to Canadians – or to anyone else in the world – if science does not co-operate. The World Health Organization said earlier this month that companies were having more trouble than expected growing the virus on eggs, a key part of the vaccine-making process.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> said, in response to questions, that the first doses are expected to be available in three to four months, subject to regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Even if a vaccine is ready by mid-fall, it will still be necessary to decide who is first in line to receive it.</p>
<p>“We will be working through the guidelines,” Dr. Butler-Jones said. The priority groups will likely include remote communities, people with underlying chronic diseases, health-care workers and essential workers, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, health officials are still assessing the potential course of the H1N1 virus, which could come back in a mutated and more deadly form in the fall, the traditional flu season.</p>
<p>Britain's chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, said yesterday that as many as 65,000 people in his country could die if the pandemic achieves its worst possible potential.</p>
<p>Dr. Butler-Jones is unwilling to offer those kinds of predictions.</p>
<p>“I guess I am less worried about the numbers, because it risks giving you a false impression, good or bad,” he said.</p>
<p>Pandemics can be far more deadly than ordinary influenza outbreaks.</p>
<p>“We see an average of 4,000 deaths a year. If you multiply that by three or four, you've got a lot of deaths,” said Dr. Butler-Jones. “But we're not going to see that, because we're going to do everything we can to prevent it.”</p>

<p>THE VACCINE MAKERS</p>
<p>Global players in the race for a vaccine against pandemic influenza H1N1.</p>
<p>• <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> has two plants, one in Ste-Foy, Que., and one in Dresden, Germany.</p>
<p>It has an exclusive contract</p>
<p>to supply enough vaccine to Canada to cover the entire</p>
<p>population. The company also has contracts with the governments of Britain (60 million</p>
<p>doses), France (50 million</p>
<p>doses), Belgium (12.6 million doses) and Finland (5.3 million doses).</p>
<p>• <span class="companylink">Novartis</span> has a cell-culture production plant in Marburg, Germany, which grows the</p>
<p>virus in cell form, a process that may be faster than the egg-based methods used by others. It is also making the vaccine</p>
<p>using eggs at facilities in</p>
<p>Liverpool, Britain, and Siena,</p>
<p>Italy. The company has not disclosed specifics, but has been approached by 30 countries seeking supplies of the vaccine for the fall.</p>
<p>• <span class="companylink">Sanofi-Aventis</span> has two main production facilities, one in Swiftwater, Penn., where the U.S. government helped fund an expansion as a pro-active measure in case of a pandemic, and another near Lyon, France.</p>
<p>• Baxter is producing the vaccine in Bohumile, Czech Republic, and will fill and finish it in Vienna, Austria. The company is contracted now to supply a total of 80 million doses to five countries: Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, and two others not disclosed.</p>
<p>• CSL has a major manufacturing plant in Parkville, Australia, the only one in the Southern Hemisphere. The company has a contract to supply 10 million Australians with the vaccine, with the first batch scheduled to be ready in late July or August. The company also recently signed a $180-million contract with the U.S.</p>
<p>• Sinovac Biotech has manufacturing facilities in Beijing and Tangshan, China. The company received its first order from the Chinese government in June, for four-million doses of the vaccine to be administered to two million people. The company expect the government to order more in</p>
<p>October, for a total of 10 million doses.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Universities abuzz with preparations for response to rapid spread of swine flu; The tendency of the H1N1 virus to target young adults has universities across Canada vigorously trying to inoculate their campuses against severe outbreaks</b>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- Along with frosh-week celebrations and keg parties, university students returning to school could be caught up in quarantines or locked out of classrooms.</p>
<p>With the swine flu virus disproportionately attacking young adults, universities have shifted into gear during these normally quiet summer months to revisit and revise emergency plans, with the aim of inoculating their schools against more severe outbreaks come fall.</p>
<p>The jury is out on how virulent H1N1 can be, but health authorities witnessed its rapid spread this month at three summer camps in Ontario's Muskoka region, where more than 200 children had symptoms of swine flu. The fear is that in university residences and classrooms, where students are in close quarters for long periods, it will move just as quickly.</p>
<p>“There is a big unknown on the implication that it will have. The big concern is that, according to epidemiological data that we have up until now, the target population of the virus is the population that we have on campuses,” said Pierre-Paul Tellier, the director of student health services at McGill University in Montreal. “Hence, we do have to prepare.</p>
<p>“Will we have answers before September? Probably not for everything. But certainly for a large number of things.”</p>
<p>McGill's health clinic, where Dr. Tellier works part time, has been configured to isolate the very ill, and the university is considering adding more help lines so that those with less-severe symptoms of H1N1 don't have to enter the clinic.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on campus, there are discussions on how to keep classes running – perhaps electronically – if professors or students are infected.</p>
<p>But at what point will campuses be closed if a full-blown pandemic hits?</p>
<p>Universities say much of their planning requires flexibility, and interrupting the school year so drastically would be a last resort.</p>
<p>In the meantime, they grapple with where to quarantine ill students, how to provide them with food and water, how to keep classes running and whether to limit travel.</p>
<p>The University of British Columbia is even studying the idea of restricting or cancelling public gatherings if the flu spreads. So much for football games.</p>
<p>“It's a very realistic possibility,” said David Zajdlik, director of health, safety and environment at UBC. “We're doing our best to maintain our programs and services. But we know that our primary interest and attention has to be on protecting the health of our vast university community.”</p>
<p>At the University of Western Ontario in London, where 4,000 students live in campus residences, officials are looking at which buildings are best suited to quarantine the ill. The university has already stockpiled masks, gloves and hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>“We are prepared, and have options to deal with how we might proceed forward,” said Jane O'Brien, associate vice-president of human resources.</p>
<p>Dalhousie University in Halifax has compiled lists of backup staff so the university can operate if up to a quarter of its faculty was out of commission with swine flu.</p>
<p>“One thing we've learned is we can't develop a planning process and put it in a drawer. So we are regularly updating and fine tuning as things change and evolve,” said spokesman Charles Crosby. “If we were hit with some aspect of the pandemic today, we would be ready.”</p>
<p>A special committee meets weekly, planning, strategizing and hoping for the best. The same is happening on other campuses.</p>
<p>“This is not just a quieter time. We know that this is a bit of a latent stage for [H1N1],” said University of Toronto spokeswoman Laurie Stephens. “We know that the numbers are going to most likely spike in September. We just want to be prepared.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>downsizing ahead Federal hog help coming: minister -</b>
</div><div>By Larry Kusch </div>

</p>
<p>The federal government will soon respond to a request from beleaguered Canadian hog producers for help in restructuring their operations or exiting the industry, Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"I can tell you we are having day-to-day discussions with Canadian Pork Council. We're very, very close, and as soon as we have something we'll give you a shout," Ritz told reporters following a speech in Winnipeg to the Canadian Special Crops Association convention.</p>
<p>The hog industry has been beset with problems ranging from overproduction and unfavourable exchange rates to high feed costs and the fallout from the outbreak of H1N1 flu, which is often publicly referred to as 'swine flu.'</p>
<p>It has asked government for $800 million to $1 billion in loans to help producers adjust to the new economic realities.</p>
<p>Manitoba is one of Canada's largest pork producing provinces, with thousands of jobs directly or indirectly linked to pig production.</p>
<p>Recently, the pork industry proposed a five-year plan guiding it through the next five years. It's expecting a response from Ritz soon.</p>
<p>The plan calls for a downsized industry that includes fewer exports of live hogs to the United States, increased pork consumption in Canada and a reduction in annual Canadian pig production to 25.5 million hogs from 31 million in 2008.</p>
<p>Gary Stordy, a spokesman for the pork council, said farmers are beginning to adjust to their new economic environment but need loans to continue. Banks, which are under financial pressures themselves, are finding it difficult to lend them money. "There's just a liquidity crisis," Stordy said.</p>
<p>He said the federal Conservatives appear willing to help. Right now it appears they want to make sure that any aid they do offer won't spark trade action from the United States.</p>
<p>While in Manitoba Wednesday, Ritz and provincial Agriculture Minister Rosann Wowchuk also announced $50 million in federal-provincial funding to enhance food safety and environmental measures and to help farmers hone their business skills.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>WRHA stops moving seniors for H1N1 beds - Elderly patients were transferred</b>
</div><div>By Bruce Owen </div>
<div>515 words</div><div>16 July 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>THE Winnipeg Regional Health Authority has stopped a temporary placement program started to free up beds for people hit by H1N1 influenza that saw dozens of elderly hospital patients transferred to personal care homes.</p>
<p>WRHA spokeswoman Heidi Graham said the transfer program that began about two months ago stopped Monday as the number of people with severe respiratory problems caused by H1N1 has dropped off in the past two weeks. Manitoba Health confirmed Wednesday 44 new cases of H1N1 flu this past week.</p>
<p>This brings the Manitoba total to 831 reported laboratory-confirmed cases. There have been six H1N1 flu-related deaths in Manitoba.</p>
<p>Graham said it's likely the transfers will be restarted should an expected flu outbreak occur in the fall.</p>
<p>The transfer program, while quickly freeing up needed hospital space, was not without controversy.</p>
<p>It meant patients in hospital were given a bed in a personal care home as soon as spots became open, over seniors in the community who are on a waiting list for a placement in the same facility.</p>
<p>For Barb Manning, it meant her 87-year-old mother-in-law Edith has been pushed back on the list for getting into the nursing home of her choice as someone from a hospital had ostensibly "jumped the line."</p>
<p>"I just think it's highly unfair," said Manning. "I don't see where they actually accomplished anything.</p>
<p>"They can't get people out of the hospital any quicker than the number of people who die in personal care homes."</p>
<p>Manning said her mother-in-law first went into a nursing home Oct. 5, 2007. Her first choice was the newly built River Park Gardens on St. Anne's Road, but because no beds were available she was transferred from the Grace Hospital to an interim placement at Tuxedo Villa on Corydon Avenue.</p>
<p>Barb Manning was told at that time it would be about one year before there would be a space available at River Park Gardens, but that was extended to this past June.</p>
<p>That's when Manning learned health authorities had adopted a policy this spring of directly transferring hospital patients to any opening in a care home, potentially displacing people like her mother-in-law on waiting lists.</p>
<p>Manning said if the WRHA reinstitutes such a transfer program in the fall, a policy should be put in place that treats seniors more fairly.</p>
<p>"After working in the Public Trustee's Office for 16 years, I know just how frequently they can transfer a person from one nursing home to another -- sometimes four or five times -- with seemingly little trouble. Certainly not all this trouble."</p>
<p>She said a person on an interim placement waiting list should get first dibs at an open space at the personal care home of their choice with the patient from the hospital taking over their spot.</p>
<p>"Hundreds and hundreds of people are waiting to go to the care home of their choice," Manning said.</p>

</p>
<p>and Victoria's tourism industry and language schools -- already battered by the slumping economy -- say they have been dealt another blow with the federal government's new visa requirements for citizens of Mexico and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>"I'm in shock they're doing this now," said Randy Stewart, who operates Stewart College of Languages in downtown Victoria. "Mexico was the only growing market [for English as a second language schools] this summer because the swine flu caused us to lose every one of our Japanese summer students and almost all of our Taiwan students this fall."</p>
<p>The Swedish presidency of the European Union threatened retaliatory action toward Canada over the visa requirement for Czech citizens. Sweden, which holds the rotating</p>
<p>EU presidency, said it favours a retaliatory visa on Canadian tourists visiting the 27-country bloc. The EU's review process could take months and a visa requirement for Canadians is far from a done deal.</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Jason Kenney said Canada reluctantly imposed the visa requirement because refugee claims from Mexico and the Czech Republic have soared in recent years. He said Canada's asylum system needs an overhaul to reduce delays and abuse.</p>
<p>Citizens of Mexico and the Czech Republic have to now apply for a visa in advance and then wait for approval or rejection. It will cost $400 a family or $75 for an individual.</p>
<p>News of the visa requirement also isn't sitting well with the province's tourism industry. Last year, about 271,000 Mexicans came to Canada and about 85,000 of those started their visits in B.C.</p>
<p>Although Mexican tourism in Victoria "isn't significant," Tourism Victoria CEO Rob Gialloreto said the market is growing. Tourism Victoria has a trade show planned in Mexico this fall as it attempts to fill huge gaps left by declining numbers of American and Japanese tourists. "The U.S. and Japan are declining for us and we're constantly looking for markets to replace those. Mexico is certainly a market that B.C. and Alberta have looked to expand."</p>
<p>Stewart said ESL students from Mexico number in the hundreds in the summer. Many Mexican families use Canadian ESL schools to give their children vacations and language lessons. And growing numbers send their children here full time, often boarding with local families.</p>
<p>Vantreight Farms, which brings in about 70 Mexican labourers every year for the daffodil harvest, is not affected as those workers require work visas and are arranged up to five months in advance, said farm spokesman Ian Vantreight.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>2,500 elective surgeries delayed for 2010 Games; Patients with blocked arteries, cancer and hernias could face longer waits</b>
</div><div>Jeff Lee, With a file from Jonathan Fowlie in Victoria </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>609 words</div><div>16 July 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun </div>
</p>
<p>Upwards of 2,500 patients waiting for surgery for everything from blocked arteries to cancer to hernias will find their elective surgeries postponed during the 2010 Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health authorities said Wednesday they have decided to cut by 35 per cent the number of elective surgeries performed over a one-month period in February and March 2010.</p>
<p>Most of the surgeries -- 2,000 in all -- were supposed to take place in the busy Fraser Health region. Another 450 or more were scheduled for Vancouver Coastal.</p>
<p>The health regions say there are three reasons for the reductions: lower demand, based on the experience of other Olympic cities; to allow some medical staff to volunteer for the Games; and the need to create "surge capacity" in normally full hospitals in the event of disease outbreaks or disasters.</p>
<p>"We need to have some surge capacity in our hospitals during the Olympics," said Dr. Patricia Daly, chief medical officer for Vancouver Coastal. "We're not cancelling surgeries. But we will need beds."</p>
<p>Some of the postponed surgeries would involve patients from out of town whose families would face difficulties finding accommodation during the Olympics.</p>
<p>Arden Krystal, vice-president of acute care for Fraser Health, said doctors will decide with patients which surgeries can be postponed. But she said medically necessary, urgent surgeries will take place no matter what.</p>
<p>"I think we need to remember that 65 per cent of our surgical capacity continues to run and that people who truly need surgery in that time will get it," Krystal said.</p>
<p>However, Health Minister Kevin Falcon insisted the decision to scale back on elective surgeries in February and March of 2010 has more to do with the flu season than it does the Olympics.</p>
<p>"What Fraser Health and Coastal Health will be doing, recognizing that we've got a flu season coming back in the fall -- everyone knows we've got H1N1 to deal with -- they are going to be making sure that as we see an anticipated increase in flu activity, that's going to use up a lot of the medical beds in the hospitals," he said.</p>
<p>"And they are going to be requiring more of the surgical beds to deal with some of the H1N1 [swine flu] and [regular] flu cases they will be traditionally dealing with at that time of year," he said.</p>
<p>New Democratic Party health critic Adrian Dix was highly critical, saying many elective surgeries are serious and need to be done promptly to avoid developing into more serious issues.</p>
<p>"Waiting for surgeries isn't an Olympic sport," Dix said, adding that surgeries should continue normally during that period.</p>
<p>"People are waiting to carry on with their lives," he said. "This is the wrong decision."</p>
<p>Dr. Jack Taunton, chief medical officer for the Vancouver Organizing Committee, said previous Games have shown many people facing non-emergent surgery tend to put off plans during the Olympics.</p>
<p>Krystal said the Olympic-period postponements will save Fraser Health $1 million to $2 million.</p>
<p>But Rick Baker, the head of Timely Medical Alternatives, a private health service brokerage that finds patients fast treatment in the United States, expects people won't accept the delays.</p>
<p>Baker said many of the so-called "elective" surgeries involve urgent, medically necessary interventions. He doesn't accept the health authorities' argument that peoples' health won't be put at risk.</p>

<div>ETHICAL TREATMENT</div>
<div>Comment</div>
<div id="hd"><b>A world of competing sorrows; There's a flu pandemic and health-care resources are scarce. How do we decide who lives and who dies?</b>
</div><div>Margaret Somerville </div>
<div>1310 words</div><div>16 July 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Founding director of the Centre for Medicine, Ethics and Law at McGill University</p>
<p>How do we decide who gets a chance to live and who dies, when those outcomes depend on who gets access to or is denied scarce health-care resources? Who should decide? On what basis? Using which processes? The H1N1 influenza pandemic raises a large cluster of such ethical issues.</p>
<p>A letter in The Globe and Mail this week in response to an article on Ottawa's pandemic preparations asks: “Why not use the criteria that already appear to be in place for prioritizing access to critical medical resources: (1) physicians and others of high status in the system, their families and close friends; (2) politicians and others of means, influence and/or celebrity, with contacts to category 1; (3) the rest of us.” There is some truth to this criticism. What might ethics tell us about how to address it?</p>
<p>First, everyone must be able to trust that the system is fair. That means we need transparency in decision-making and its implementation, and we must be able to trust the decision-makers. Then we need to consider the ethics of decision-making at the physician-patient level, the institutional level (hospitals, for example), the societal level and even the global level.</p>
<p>Physicians owe each patient a primary obligation of personal care – that is, they must not put the interests of others before the “best interests” of the patient. Physicians are constrained by the resources available in the health-care system, but they must make reasonable efforts to obtain the resources the patient needs, especially if the patient's life is on the line. Patients must be able to trust physicians to be their primary advocates.</p>
<p>Hospitals have ethical obligations to all their patients, including ensuring the just and efficient use of their limited resources. They need ethical principles on which to base their policies to deal with an H1N1 pandemic and ethical processes to implement these policies.</p>
<p>Such policies, for instance, can address decisions about preparedness – how many and what kind of ventilators to buy (experts warn that patients with H1N1 flu might need the $40,000 models, not the $10,000 ones) or, likewise, cardiac bypass machines used as a last resort for patients too sick to be placed on a ventilator. Or decisions about staffing the highly specialized intensive-care units needed to use that equipment. Would it be ethical to allow trainees to undertake tasks they're not usually permitted to carry out?</p>
<p>These policies can also deal with ethical issues in preventive measures, such as priority of access to flu shots. And with criteria for allocation of and access to treatment – that is, triaging H1N1 patients (deciding who gets treatment and, for those who do, in what priority).</p>
<p>Almost everyone agrees health-care workers should be the first to receive flu shots when a vaccine becomes available. That is not only fair to those workers, but benefits the rest of us who need their care. As well, infected health-care workers would spread the virus to vulnerable sick people. And because health-care workers fear taking the virus home to their families and close associates, those people also should have priority. Likewise, because health-care workers put their lives on the line to care for others, they should have priority in access to treatment.</p>
<p>But who should be next? Medical need will play a major role in that decision. But what about situations in which that does not give a clear answer?</p>
<p>An ethical principle says we should act so as to implement a preference in favour of the most vulnerable people. But who are they in relation to H1N1 infection?</p>
<p>Should we take only medical vulnerability into account or should factors, such as being the parent of young vulnerable children, weigh in the decision? And what about socioeconomic vulnerability, such as in first nations communities, which increases the risks associated with the H1N1 virus? I believe ethics requires they be given preference.</p>
<p>Should young people be “preferred” over elderly people? If young people are at greater risk of serious complications from H1N1, they should have priority. That's a medical reason. That contrasts with the argument that elderly people have had a “fair innings” and young people have not, so giving priority to the latter is just. That's discrimination on the basis of age, which is not usually justifiable.</p>
<p>The companion question to “Who should be next?” is the one implied by the Globe letter writer: “Who should not be next?” To take just one group, I would suggest that politicians and their families should be subject to the same criteria as all other Canadians. When we take a public role in deciding for others, we must be prepared to live according to the rules we impose on them.</p>
<p>Our largest experience in making decisions on the allocation of scarce, life-saving, health-care resources has been in relation to allocating organs for transplant and some expensive medical technologies, such as cardiac assist devices – people who are likely to have a sudden cardiac arrest are fitted with a device that shocks their heart back to normal rhythm. More people could potentially benefit from these than the health-care system is willing to pay for.</p>
<p>It's been argued that, ethically, a lottery system to decide who gets access is the most fair, because everyone has an equal chance of receiving or being denied treatment. But most people find pulling a life-or-death ticket out of a hat unacceptable. Although it makes logical sense, we probably have a moral intuition or emotional response warning us this is not the best ethical approach.</p>
<p>On the whole, we use a “first come, first served” allocation mechanism that allows for exceptions. For instance, if the person at the top of the list would live until another organ became available and one further down the list would not, the latter could be given the organ. This system is not ethically perfect, because, for instance, people of higher socioeconomic status tend to get on the list before those of lower status and, therefore, get priority, and some discretion is involved in allocation decisions, meaning that subjective factors (often characterized as “medical considerations”) can play a role. But, overall, it works ethically well enough.</p>
<p>So what about the ethics of our societal decision-making? Should taxpayers have a say in what the total bill for dealing with H1N1 should be? Might they want to spend more than the government does? What services are needed for rural Canadians if we're to act justly? Patients on ventilators need to be in critical care units in tertiary level hospitals. Do we have the Medivac capacity to give them timely access?</p>
<p>At the global level, the World Health Organization has asked developed countries to consider sharing some of the health-care resources needed to deal with H1N1 flu, such as vaccine, with developing countries with almost no supplies.</p>
<p>And what about the ethical decision-making process? What's ethically required will vary depending on the situation, from individual physicians to health-care administrators, ethics committees and government bodies, but will always require care to avoid conflict of interest.</p>
<p>H1N1 flu presents us with what we call in ethics “a world of competing sorrows” – that is, one in which there is no response that does only good and not also harm. And that's before we even touch on the enormous emotional toll on individuals, institutions and society that will be involved in these situations and decisions. We will all need to be as wise and courageous as possible.</p>

<div>INTERVIEW / HEALTH MINISTER LEONA AGLUKKAQ</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Pandemic hits, isotopes disappear and all eyes are on a rookie minister; ‘It's difficult to please everyone,' Aglukkaq says as flu outbreak and isotope shortage put her in the hot seat</b>
</div><div>GLORIA GALLOWAY </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The medical isotope supply is about to dry up and a pandemic flu is threatening to mutate into a more sinister version of the disease that has already killed 45 Canadians.</p>
<p>Both files are on the desk of the same rookie federal cabinet minister from Nunavut – a woman who was initially congratulated by opposition critics for her spirit of co-operation but who now reaps more censure than praise.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq was in the Arctic hamlet of Cambridge Bay yesterday as officials in her department and at the Public Health Agency of Canada were grappling with the two health issues confronting Canadians.</p>
<p>This is the only time of year that she can make it to many of the remote communities in her riding.</p>
<p>But in a rare one-on-one interview, Ms. Aglukkaq said she is in constant contact with the people who are working on both the isotope issue and influenza planning.</p>
<p>“Both files are equally important and require our attention,” said Ms. Aglukkaq. “It has been a busy time. But I have a really good relationship with the provinces and the territories and we have officials on the front row. Everyone is working very hard on the issues – two very big files.”</p>
<p>Neither crisis was anticipated when Ms. Aglukkaq accepted the cabinet post in January after being elected to a federal seat for the first time in October.</p>
<p>“You always expect that you will be on the hot seat for something,” she said. “But that it would be these two simultaneously at the same time? It's nothing I expected. But I am dealing with it. I have to deal with it.”</p>
<p>Both files have been challenging, she said. Both have had their rewards.</p>
<p>“We are making a lot of good progress in both areas. … But every day there are lessons learned where we can always do better,” she said.</p>
<p>Her critics accuse the minister – and the Public Health Agency of Canada that falls within her portfolio – of withholding information that Canadians need, particularly as it relates to the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>“She needs to be visible and present giving Canadians up-to-date reports and [the government's] national plans for both issues,” said Judy Wasylycia-Leis, health critic for the federal New Democrats. “She started off very visible and now she is missing in action.”</p>
<p>Carolyn Bennett, the Liberal critic, said Ms. Aglukkaq keeps pointing to a pandemic plan drafted in 2006. “We are now in the middle of a pandemic response and we are not seeing it implemented,” Dr. Bennett said. “It's like the binder is still sitting on the shelf somewhere.”</p>
<p>Information that flowed freely when the disease first arrived in Canada now comes in fits and starts. News conferences that were once a daily event are now sporadic.</p>
<p>“It's difficult to please everyone. It's difficult to be out there every single day when you're trying to move files as well,” Ms. Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>If there is an information overload, it could be ignored, she said. “But we have to remain vigilant with H1N1; it's going to come back in the fall. And to continue trying to educate Canadians about the precautions that they can take is so very important,” she said. “It is a challenge to balance that.”</p>
<p>Whenever Ms. Aglukkaq talks about the challenges of her portfolio, she mentions the work she is doing with the provinces and the territories. Critics say that makes it difficult to determine where responsibility for pandemic planning – or for dealing with the isotope shortage – actually lies.</p>
<p>Raisa Deber, a professor of health policy at the University of Toronto, said she senses that Prime Minister Stephen Harper regards health as the exclusive purview of the provinces.</p>
<p>“I get the sense that the [Health] Minister has been trying to do an extremely good job,” said Dr. Deber.</p>
<p>“Part of the trouble is that you have ideologues within the government. And one of the ideological things within the government itself is that these things that are under provincial jurisdiction, the federal government has no business being involved in them.”</p>
<p>Ms. Aglukkaq, for her part, said the responsibilities are determined by the nature of the Canadian health system.</p>
<p>“We have a pandemic plan that was put in place with all of the provinces and the territories and the system of managing that requires us to work together with the provinces and the territories,” she said.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, at the end of the day, [it is] provincial health ministries that are delivering health care.”</p>
<p>Pamela Fralick, president of the Canadian Healthcare Association, a federation of provincial and territorial hospital and health organizations, said there is a feeling among her members that there has been a lack of transparency around the medical-isotope issue. Radioactive isotopes used for diagnosis and treatment have been in short supply since the reactor at Chalk River, Ont., was shut down in May.</p>
<p>But “we actually think from the outside looking in that they have done a pretty good job of handling [H1N1],” Ms. Fralick said.</p>
<p>“Could it be better? Yes. And I think they would say the same. And I would hope that they would strive to make it better because this isn't the end. It's the beginning.”</p>

<p>A bishop in Britain has advised his diocese to ban holy water from churches in a bid to halt the spread of swine flu.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Chelmsford in eastern England has suggested sprucing up hygiene in churches by removing receptacles for water.</p>
<p>"Some churches have a stoup for holy water near the entrance to the church door, and people are invited to dip a finger in this, and to make the sign of the cross as a reminder of their baptism.</p>
<p>"The water contained in stoups can easily become a source of infection and a means of rapidly spreading the virus," said The Right Rev. John Gladwin.</p>
<p>"This practice should be suspended."</p>
<p>In a set of directives sent to priests in the county of Essex that includes Chelmsford, Gladwin said they should advise members of their congregation who have flu-like symptoms to stay at home.</p>
<p>Gladwin also urged caution when taking holy communion to residential homes, warning if anyone had flu-like symptoms the "priest alone should drink wine from the chalice."</p>
<p>Chaplain Chris Newlands added: "People need to be reassured that the church is doing everything it can to stop the spread of infection."</p>
<p>Britain is Europe's worst hit country, with 17 people dying after contracting swine flu.</p>

<p>Hundreds of school kids have contracted swine flu at three summer camps in Ontario's Muskoka area, a area of lakes popular for holidaying, local health authorities said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>As of July 13, 227 children and 61 staff members had been confirmed with the H1N1 virus, the majority of whom had been sent home, said Bill Mindell, director of clinical services for the Simcoe-Muskoka District Health Unit.</p>
<p>"They're not severe, I would say, certainly none have required hospitalization. They have had coughs or fever, general unwell or malaise, but none have required hospitalization," he said.</p>
<p>Mindell said camps are being more vigilant about sick campers. The camps are also taking extra precautions in regards to cleanliness; providing hand rinse basins in dining halls and washing laundry in high heat.</p>
<p>Mindell said it is still early in camp season, so the camps must remain on the lookout for further outbreaks.</p>
<p>The three camps, about 150 kilometres north of Toronto, started reporting the discovery of flu-like symptoms in late June to the public health unit, and testing was immediately ordered for the sick kids.</p>
<p>None of the 69 camps in the region has been closed, said Mindell.</p>

<p>It is good that Canada has a plan for the H1N1 pandemic. Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, in a letter to this newspaper's editor, assures us that the 2006 Pandemic Preparedness Plan is “comprehensive,” and working. (Her letter is published in full at www.theglobeandmail.com[http://www.theglobeandmail.com].) Why, she asks, should Canada convene a national summit on swine flu, akin to the one in the United States in which President Barack Obama took part last week? We already know what we are doing, she implies.</p>
<p>Ms. Aglukkaq was responding to criticism in this space that the government lacks vigilance on swine flu. But her bureaucratic reply misses the point. Canada's plan may be excellent, indeed. Let's hope it is, if and when it is put to the test. Even the best game plan, however, may go awry when the other team shows up. And the plan is not a straightforward set of defences. It involves choices, which means discussion. It's about public health, so it needs to engage the public.</p>
<p>It's not as if the United States had no plan, and suddenly woke up to the need for one. “The goal of the summit,” explained Kathleen Sebelius, the Health Secretary, “is to launch a national influenza campaign … to build on and tailor states' existing pandemic plans, share lessons learned and best practices during the spring and summer H1N1 wave, and discuss preparedness priorities.” Canada, on the other hand, has a plan. The plan is working. Not to worry, then.</p>
<p>Britain also has a plan, but it is not boasting about it. Instead, its health department this month published an 11-page paper explaining the July 2 decision to move from “containment to treatment” of the swine flu. It's a model of engagement and transparency.</p>
<p>The British document asks, “What should people do if they think they have swine flu?” First, they should check their symptoms, either on the government website or by calling the Swine Flu Information Line; second, if they think they have swine flu, they should call their general practitioner, who can make a diagnosis over the phone (no swab is needed); and third, they should ask their GP for an authorization number to be taken by their “Flu Friend” (a designated person to help out in case of illness) to pick up antiviral medicine at a selected location. Soon the National Pandemic Flu Service will be up and running, to take the pressure off GPs.</p>
<p>By contrast, Canada's Public Health Agency simply tells people, “Talk to a health professional if you experience severe flu-like symptoms.” It says people with swine flu are not being given antivirals because the disease is mostly mild so far – except when it isn't – and because Canada might run out. Whether that call is the right one or not, the Public Health Agency does not spell out for patients what their “health professional” is supposed to do. Send people home with inhalers, as happened to a Calgary mother of four, who later died from swine flu?</p>
<p>It's good Canada has a plan, but that is not a substitute for vigilance.</p>

</p>
<p>HAMILTON -- Green Day will have a captive audience at Copps Coliseum tonight. And it won't just be the band's playing.</p>
<p>Depending on where fans' seats are, once they check in for the show, they won't be allowed to leave. And the venue is adding extra security to make sure they don't try.</p>
<p>It's part of the "forced will call" experiment that Hamilton Entertainment and Convention Facilities Inc. is trying for the first time, in collaboration with Green Day. It's designed to reduce scalping and ticket resale.</p>
<p>A "forced will call" procedure means that ordered tickets are not available for pickup until the night of the show. Holders of the "will call" tickets must present the original credit card used to order the tickets, confirmation number and photo ID.</p>
<p>Once they have their tickets they are escorted directly into the venue. The arena will have additional box office staff in place, as well as additional security to ensure that the process runs smoothly and efficiently, says Duncan Gillespie, chief executive officer of the corporation that operates the venue."The concept is you can't scalp tickets," says Gillespie. "It ensures the person who buys the ticket sees the concert."</p>
<p>He says Green Day is determined to attack scalping and that this is one way the band aims to keep ticket prices down.</p>
<p>At tonight's concert, the forced will call applies to 3,000 tickets, namely, all tickets purchased: on the floor, all of sections 107, 108, 122, 123 and the front of sections 106 and 124, plus other ticket orders not picked up in advance.</p>
<p>"It's been tried elsewhere and works fine," says Gillespie, "though there are issues, like if you come down with H1N1."</p>
<p>Tonight's show by the American rockers will be preceded by a tailgate party featuring Hamilton's Blacken'd Red, from 5: 30 p.m.</p>
<p>WHAT: Green Day</p>
<p>WHEN: Tonight, 8 p.m.</p>
<p>WHERE: Copps Coliseum, Hamilton</p>

<p>HOLY WATER BAN TO HALT SWINE FLU</p>
<p>LONDON - A bishop in Britain has advised his diocese to ban holy water from churches in a bid to halt the spread of swine flu.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Chelmsford in eastern England has suggested sprucing up hygiene in churches by removing receptacles for water.</p>
<p>"Some churches have a stoup for holy water near the entrance to the church door, and people are invited to dip a finger in this, and to make the sign of the cross as a reminder of their baptism," the Right Reverend John Gladwin said.</p>
<p>A stoup is a basin or a font for holy water.</p>
<p>"The water contained in stoups can easily become a source of infection and a means of rapidly spreading the virus," he said.</p>
<p>"This practice should be suspended."</p>
<p><span class="companylink">L'OREAL</span> HEIRESS FACES SCRUTINY</p>
<p>PARIS - A French court will examine whether the elderly heiress to the <span class="companylink">L'Oreal</span> fortune, Europe's richest woman, was in her right mind when she lavished gifts worth close to $1.4 billion on a younger male friend.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Philippe Courroye, who has been probing for over a year the gifts made by Liliane Bettencourt to photographer and socialite Francois-Marie Banier, told Reuters on Wednesday the case would come to trial in September.</p>
<p>Banier, 62, a fixture in fashionable Paris circles for four decades, has received artwork, cheques, cash, life insurance and other gifts from Bettencourt since 2002. Judicial sources estimate the total value of the gifts at about US$1.4 billion.</p>
<p>"What I have given to Francois-Marie Banier, though it's a lot, is not that much when you put it in perspective," Bettencourt told the newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche in December, in her only interview on the matter.</p>
<p>Bettencourt, 86, is the biggest shareholder in cosmetics giant <span class="companylink">L'Oreal</span>, the company her father founded. Her fortune was estimated at $13.4 billion by Forbes this year, placing her in 21st position on the magazine's list of billionaires.</p>
<p>Courroye's investigation into the gifts stems from a complaint filed in late 2007 by her daughter, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, who accuses Banier of taking advantage of her mother's frailty to extort staggering sums from her.</p>
<p>French media have leapt on the scandal over the past few months, publishing stories portraying Bettencourt as a lonely widow hooked on her friendship with the dashing Banier and helplessly giving in to his increasingly outrageous demands.</p>
<p>MAN FIXING BED BLOWS UP HOME</p>
<p>BERLIN - A German who tried to fix his leaky air mattress blew up his apartment instead, the fire brigade in the western city of Duesseldorf said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old man used tire repair solvent to plug a hole in his airbed and left it overnight.</p>
<p>But it blew up when he went to inflate it the next day.</p>
<p>"A spark from the electric air pump ignited it," a fire brigade spokesman said.</p>
<p>The blast pushed his living room wall into the building's stairwell and caused extensive damage to walls, windows and furniture.</p>
<p>Firefighters evacuated the 12-apartment building and a neighbouring housing block while they checked for structural damage.</p>
<p>The man suffered burns on his arms, while a three-year-old girl suffered first- degree burns.</p>
<p>WORLD'S OLDEST MOM DIES AT 70</p>
<p>MADRID - A Spanish woman who became the world's oldest mother when she gave birth to twin boys in 2006 has died aged 70, a local newspaper reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Maria del Carmen Bousada de Lara, who was 67 when she had the twins following artificial insemination in the United States, was diagnosed with cancer just months after the birth, the Diario de Cadiz said.</p>
<p>Bousada admitted she had lied about her age when she applied for the process at the Los Angeles clinic as the legal limit was 55 years and later joked she may even live to meet her grandchildren after her own mother lived to the age of 101.</p>
<p>Bousada passed away on Saturday after a long fight against the illness, the paper said.</p>
<p>MORE DIE IN DRUG WAR BLOODBATH</p>
<p>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico - Mexico's drug wars claimed 17 more lives Tuesday and Wednesday as cartels hit back at a government squeeze on their operations in the country's north.</p>
<p>Judicial sources said two police officers had been shot dead driving in an official car through Chihuahua, the capital of the eponymous northern border state that has seen much of the bloodshed.</p>
<p>The attack was carried out using a 0.50 caliber weapon -- often used "by drug traffickers to kill police," said the official, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Chihuahua state shares long borders with U.S. states of Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>In the border city of Ciudad Juarez, where 1,650 people died in 2008 amid the deployment of 8,500 soldiers, 10 men were executed.</p>
<p>And officials reported another five deaths across the state.</p>
<p>The Mexican government has deployed 36,000 federal troops across the country since 2006 to crackdown on cartels shipping cocaine and other drugs to the United States.</p>
<p>The cartels have hit back with ever-more violent methods, beheading their victims and launching audacious attacks on federal authorities.</p>
<p>3 CHARGED WITH KILLING B.C. MAN</p>
<p>MELBOURNE - Police have arrested three Australian men for the murder of a Canadian citizen who was beaten at a bar just outside of Melbourne last week.</p>
<p>Kelowna, B.C., native Cain Anthony Aguiar died Tuesday in a hospital in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Aguiar, 25, was injured in a bar fight in Yarraville, a suburb just west of the city, on July 9.</p>
<p>Two 22-year-old men and a 19-year-old man were arrested Wednesday and each charged with murder.</p>
<p>RAPE, ASSAULT RAMPANT IN CONGO</p>
<p>BRUSSELS - Soldiers in the Democratic Republic of Congo who rape and assault civilians often go unpunished because the justice system is too weak to hold the perpetrators to account, a rights group said today.</p>
<p>Few senior army officers in the wartorn Central African country have been prosecuted for committing or allowing sexual violence against women and girls.</p>
<p>Commanders often protect their soldiers and may even obstruct the course of justice, Human Rights Watch said in a report released in Brussels.</p>

</p>
<p>The death of a young B.C. child, as a result of H1N1 influenza, is a tragic indication that this virus remains viable and potent.</p>
<p>As Dr. Danuta Skowronski so forcefully stated in Wednesday's Province: "These severe outcomes of the pandemic are a reminder that influenza is not to be trivialized."</p>
<p>The problem is this: In the warm glow of a British Columbia summer it is easy to forget that the world remains in the grip of a deadly pandemic.</p>
<p>When summer ends, it is expected H1N1 infections will grow in strength and numbers. This pandemic is not going away anytime soon and, in fact, it appears the worst is yet to come.</p>
<p>So what can we do now to safeguard ourselves and our families?</p>
<p>Dr. Skowronski, who is a physician epidemiologist at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, offers this invaluable advice:</p>
<p>"It is important that people continue to take precautions . . . frequent hand-washing, staying home if sick, coughing and sneezing into the crook of the elbow sleeve, and seeking care early in the case of underlying conditions or pregnancy."</p>
<p>In other words, as the adage goes, far better safe than sorry.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Climate change, protectionism to be on table for Three Amigos; North American leaders to convene for two-day, trilateral summit</b>
</div><div>Sheldon Alberts </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>558 words</div><div>15 July 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun </div>
</p>
<p>Mexican President Felipe Calderon is preparing to host Prime Minister Stephen Harper and U.S. President Barack Obama for a North American leaders' meeting in early August -- reviving a tradition of trilateral summits established during the latter years of the Bush administration.</p>
<p>Issues surrounding climate change and mounting Canadian and Mexican anxiety over U.S. protectionism are expected to dominate the two-day summit, which sources say is tentatively scheduled for around Aug. 9 and 10 in Guadalajara, the capital of Mexico's Jalisco state.</p>
<p>The White House has yet to confirm Obama's travel schedule, but the meeting has been listed on a U.S. State Department planning calendar and Harper's office said Tuesday it appears the summit is a go.</p>
<p>"My understanding it is proceeding," Harper spokesman Kory Teneycke said Tuesday when asked about the meeting. "I know we have it in our draft travel itinerary."</p>
<p>A U.S. government official said the "actual dates may not be set in concrete."</p>
<p>But in preparation for the meeting in Mexico, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has invited Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon and Mexican Foreign Affairs Secretary Patricia Espinosa to Washington on Thursday to discuss issues ranging from continental energy supply to cooperation in dealing with the swine flu virus.</p>
<p>The August summit offers the first concrete evidence Obama remains committed to continuing the annual meeting of North American leaders, which was first held in 2005 when former president George W. Bush hosted then prime minister Paul Martin and Mexican president Vicente Fox at Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas.</p>
<p>Bush also hosted the most recent summit in New Orleans in April 2008.</p>
<p>The focal point in past summits was always the Security and Prosperity Partnership, a White House-driven initiative to increase intelligence sharing, cooperation on counterterrorism programs and border security between the three countries.</p>
<p>But the partnership's agenda -- which activists on the political left criticized as secretive and undemocratic -- has effectively been pushed to the background since Obama took office in January.</p>
<p>Instead, Obama has placed global warming and economic stimulus at the top of his priority list in early dealings with both Harper and Calderon.</p>
<p>The North American leaders' meeting will also give Harper some much-needed face time with Obama -- the two men did not hold a bilateral meeting at the recent G8 summit in Italy -- to seek relief from contentious Buy American provisions that essentially ban Canadian companies from procurement contracts tied to the $787-billion US stimulus package.</p>
<p>Cannon will press Ottawa's case against protectionism in advance when he meets in Washington on Thursday with Clinton, a senior Canadian official told Canwest News Service.</p>
<p>"Canada will continue to voice its concerns with Buy American provisions -- ask for flexibility and to keep markets open and free and to reject protectionism," the official said.</p>
<p>Because the Three Amigos summits began during the Bush era, there had been some speculation over whether they would remain a priority for Obama, who has an already-full calendar comprised of foreign travel and international summits.</p>
<p>For example, Harper, Obama and Calderon will see each other yet again in September at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh.</p>

</p>
<p>Yvonne de Wit, the manager at Toronto Public Health who designed the city's A La Cart program for multi-ethnic street food, has been working nights at the Seaton House men's hostel, cleaning feces and breaking up fights.</p>
<p>Uli Watkiss, the city clerk, is working in the mail room in the basement of City Hall. "I'm fine," she said. "A lot better than some of the other people."</p>
<p>And at the city's water filtration plants, management staff have stayed in the locked facilities day and night since the strike began, with other staff bringing them in food.</p>
<p>These are the unsung heroes of the city workers' strike, now in its fourth week -- the 4,000 "non-union and management staff " trying to keep some of the city functioning. The city has forbidden them from talking to the media, so none spoke for the record for this article. Many said they are working seven days a week, 12 hours a day. They are earning barge-loads of overtime pay, but are not seeing their families, and many summer vacations are now up in the air.</p>
<p>"Everybody's burnt out," said one corporate security staffer who said she has worked 12-hour days with just one day off over two weeks, and was denied permission to attend a family funeral. "Everybody's exhausted."</p>
<p>The city knows these workers' value as it attempts to hold firm against asking the province to legislate the strikers back to work. Last week Mayor David Miller sent an email to all of them to thank them.</p>
<p>"I want you all to know that I appreciate your work and am very proud of how you have responded during this challenging time,'' Mr. Miller wrote.</p>
<p>"Whether you are working at a transfer station, helping keep our facilities clean and running smoothly, working in a temporary garbage drop-off site, water treatment or supply plant, parks facility, courts or in a social service program -- you have worked as a team with impressive results."</p>
<p>Among other redeployed managers, Scott Barrett, a senior co-ordinator at Heritage Toronto, is answering the phones at the Access Toronto call centre in North York. Steve Johnston, the spokesman for Transportation Services, is collecting bags of garbage at Moss Park.</p>
<p>In some places, the strike has become quite a makework project. At the Bermondsey Transfer Station, a spot accepting the public's garbage, I counted four police officers, two guys videotaping the picket line, two Bylaw Enforcement officers, six management staff, plus about 50 pickets. Everyone seemed serene (except the public waiting in a long line of cars to drop off trash). One manager was cleaning off a gas grill to cook up lunch for his colleagues.</p>
<p>A manager in Municipal Licensing -- watching to prevent illegal dumping -- said she is working seven days a week, but it is not all bad.</p>
<p>"We expected to be sitting behind a desk, so this is kind of a nice change," she said, standing in the sun. Still, she added, "We're not allowed to take vacation." I asked her how long she could hold out. "We're OK," she replied. "We're strong."</p>
<p>At City Hall, the city has assigned dozens of managers to "picket monitor" duty. They wear blue windbreakers that read "Toronto" and sit by the picket lines. One of them, a woman who works in human resources at Metro Hall, said, "It's stressful for all of us." Another, a man, said, "It's boring. It's sad."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the city has redeployed its lawyers to process traffic tickets, because the regular prosecutors are on strike. On the third floor of Old City Hall yesterday, an agent -- who represents people charged with traffic offences -- pointed to a silver lining to the strike: the inexperienced prosecutors mean fines are lighter right now. And a lawyer confirmed this: "We've been given a little briefing on what [kind of a deal with an accused] is permitted, but it all falls apart when the JP [justice of the peace] lowers his glasses and says, 'Mr. Prosecutor, isn't there something that we can do here?' "</p>
<p>Outside the Seaton House men's shelter, Marie King, who works there, was picketing outside. She is worried the management staff replacing her could fall ill. "How are they going to recognize HIV, TB, hep C or swine flu?" she asked.</p>
<p>A manager confirmed he has new respect for those who have walked out. "It's pretty hard, man," he said. "We're not used to this kind of stuff. It's a real eye-opener." pkuitenbrouwer@ nationalpost.com</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Japan's monarchs wave a fond farewell to Canada; About 3,000 people, mostly Japanese-Canadians, join the emperor and empress for a short walk downtown on the final day of their tour</b>
</div><div>Mary Frances Hill   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>

</p>
<p>When Japan's Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko took the last public walk of their 12-day cross-Canada tour on Tuesday, seven-year-old Jericho Power and his little brother Angelo walked right along with them.</p>
<p>Perched on his father James's shoulders and clutching miniature paper flags of Japan and Canada, Angelo, 3, got his first and perhaps last chance to see the royal family, prominent symbols in his blended heritage.</p>
<p>As the emperor and empress walked from the Pan Pacific Hotel to the Vancouver Convention Centre on the last day of a tour that covered Toronto, Ottawa, Victoria and Vancouver, the Power family followed their steps behind yellow cordons.</p>
<p>Whether or not the boys remember the day, their parents, Aya and James Power, thought it important to expose them to a touch of royalty. Aya Power hails from Hiroshima, Japan; their father, who met and married their mother in Vancouver, is Australian.</p>
<p>All the family members are now Canadian citizens, with Jericho and Angelo also holding Japanese and Australian citizenship.</p>
<p>"My kids are Japanese, they have Japanese citizenship and this is their emperor," said James Power.</p>
<p>The Powers joined about 3,000 people, most of them Japanese-Canadians, who cheered the emperor and empress during their short walk to the convention centre.</p>
<p>The monarchs then participated in a short reception with politicians and a reunion with James Standen, 77; Francois Elmaleh, 74; and Charlie Kingston, 77.</p>
<p>Akihito had requested a meeting with the three, who accompanied him in Victoria when he last visited B.C. as a 19-year-old crown prince. At that time the three were serving in the Canadian Forces.</p>
<p>Cheryl Lee, the owner of Muskoka Language International, a company that places Japanese students in high schools across B.C., said the royal visit was a signal to societies nervous about swine flu that Canada is safe.</p>
<p>"With the H1N1 virus, a lot of students haven't been allowed to come to Canada. This visit symbolizes more than just all that beautiful royalty stuff. It says, 'this country welcomes you, it's safe and healthy.'"</p>
<p>Ken Suzuki, 73, and his wife Shizuka, 68, who moved to Vancouver from Nagoya, Japan, in 1970, said the emperor and empress are seldom seen in Japan, and it was the first time he had seen them.</p>
<p>He said the monarchs' son and daughter-in-law, Crown Prince Naruhito and Princess Masako, are more active public figures in their country of origin and more popular among young people.</p>
<p>"We learn about Imperial Japan growing up. But young people in Japan, when they are teenagers, they are independent and don't think about [senior royalty] so much. But gradually, they learn of traditional systems.''</p>
<p>Among the politicians at the final reception -- including Premier Gordon Campbell and Stockwell Day, minister of international trade and responsible for the Asia-Pacific Gateway -- was Bob Tarlek, mayor of Lethbridge, Alta.</p>
<p>Tarlek said Lethbridge has a large population of Japanese-Canadians who were forced out of Vancouver because of fears that Japanese residents would commit sabotage in port cities during the Second World War.</p>
<p>"Japanese-Canadians weren't even allowed to buy a home in Lethbridge until 1950," said Tarlek.</p>
<p>Japanese-Canadians eventually thrived in Lethbridge, which twinned with two Japanese cities and welcomed hundreds of students from the Pacific country, he said.</p>
<p>The Canadian tour marks the 80th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Canada and Japan.</p>

<p>A young child from the Fraser region has died from the swine flu virus, the B.C. government announced Tuesday. The child becomes the first death in B.C. resulting from H1N1. The government said Tuesday a young woman in the same region has also died in connection with the H1N1 influenza outbreak. The woman lived with a person who had the virus, but was not confirmed to have had H1N1.</p>

</div><div>Jennifer Ditchburn   </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Mexican travellers and the Canadian tourism industry that serves them were sent into panic mode yesterday after the sudden announcement of a new visa requirement for visitors from that country.</p>
<p>Visas were also reapplied to citizens entering Canada from the Czech Republic. Both decisions were based on a growing number of refugee claims.</p>
<p>The Czech government responded by recalling its ambassador to Canada and imposing visa requirements on Canadian diplomats and business travellers.</p>
<p>But it was the Mexican visa requirement, announced by Immigration Minister Jason Kenney late Monday, that will be felt most acutely in Canada.</p>
<p>Mexico was the sixth largest source of tourists to Canada last year, and the numbers had been steadily increasing. Problem is, it's the also the largest source of refugee claims.</p>
<p>A Canadian Tourism Commission website geared toward Mexicans, called "Escape from the Routine,'' was still boasting that a "valid passport and return plane ticket is all you need'' to visit Canada.</p>
<p>Tour operators, hotel owners and other Canadian businesses that depend on Mexican tourism described the decision, announced late yesterday, as a "bomb'' that would affect both their revenues and their staffing levels.</p>
<p>The industry is calling on the Conservative government to delay the visa requirement until November, to allow it to cope with the change.</p>
<p>"What really hurts about this is that there's was no warning at all . . . and all of a sudden, basically the day the doors were supposed to open on the beginning of the peak season, they're being shut in our face a little bit,'' said Hume Rogers, of Ottawa's Capital Hotel and Suites.</p>
<p>Rogers had 25 rooms booked for 10 days this month with a Mexican tour group.</p>
<p>Finding a Mexican on Parliament Hill is as easy as tuning in to Spanish chatter around the Peace Tower or the Eternal Flame.</p>
<p>A group of Mexican high-school teachers visiting for a month on an educational exchange program had arrived on Sunday, making it in just under the wire.</p>
<p>"This has been a difficult year for our country,'' said Larissa Montiel, of Mexico City.</p>
<p>"There's the swine flu, and people shutting their doors to us, and now these immigration problems. It's sad for us.''</p>
<p>In Mexico City, people with plans to visit Canadian cities this summer flooded the Canadian embassy and their travel agent with calls, trying to figure out what they needed to do to get their documents on time.</p>
<p>A 48-hour grace period for Mexicans with imminent travel was to expire at 10 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>A source with the Mexican government said the embassy had given little information or guidance to people on what steps were required or how long the process would take.</p>
<p>A notice on the embassy's website directs travellers to send their documents by courier to the embassy.</p>
<p>Carla Rosa, director of GrupoTravel's head office in Mexico City, said people are reluctant to give their documents to a third party for transport, and are showing up at the embassy anyway.</p>
<p>"It's a mess,'' said Rosa, who said many people will lose their money.</p>
<p>A government spokesperson said things are actually running smoothly at the embassy in Mexico, with lineups in "the low hundreds.''</p>

<p>QUEBEC</p>
<p>Quebec health officials are reporting another death associated with the H1N1 flu for a national tally of 42. They say the victim was a woman in her 60s from the Montreal area who had underlying medical conditions. Quebec now has 16 deaths and more than 2,200 confirmed cases of H1N1. Across Canada, there have been more than 9,700 cases of the virus since the outbreak began, with most being mild. There have also been 14 deaths in Ontario, six in Manitoba, three in Saskatchewan and three in Alberta. The common flu sends about 20,000 Canadians to hospital each year.</p>

<p>TORONTO -- Aboriginals make up 10 per cent of Manitoba's population, but account for two-thirds of the people in intensive care for swine flu. Nunavut, which is 85 per cent Inuit, has a disproportionately high rate of H1N1 infections. And the first person to die of swine flu in Australia was a young aboriginal man in one of the country's most remote communities, leaving Australian officials worried that aboriginals are at a higher risk for swine flu.</p>
<p>Why do natives face a greater threat from the new H1N1 virus?</p>
<p>A study published earlier this month in the medical journal The Lancet reported the answer is not found in the flu virus or the genetics of aboriginal people, but rather the social conditions on reserves.</p>
<p>Poverty, poor nutrition, overcrowded housing and a lack of clean water all contribute to the rapid spread of the new virus, said Malcolm King, one of the report's authors and scientific director of Alberta's Institute of Aboriginal Peoples' Health at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</p>
<p>“Already in this first phase of the swine flu epidemic, aboriginal people have fared badly,” Dr. King said yesterday. “The prospects of a disproportionate health burden in the next phase of the pandemic are looming over us.”</p>
<p>Manitoba aboriginal leaders have declared a state of emergency in their communities because of swine flu, and called on the federal and provincial governments to act.</p>
<p>Fears of the 1918 Spanish flu still haunt many on reserves. The disease wiped out villages.</p>
<p>Since then, public health officials have done more to fight the disease. But there's still work to do because the new virus could be devastating to aboriginal people, Dr. King said. The latest victim was a 25-year-old native mother who was visiting family in Yellow Quill, Sask.</p>
<p>“We really can't afford to have a segment of our population with high infection rates because it increases the risk for everyone. So we really need to put our resources and energy into dealing with the flu problem in vulnerable communities,” Dr. King said.</p>
<p>There's also an economic self-interest, he added. Sickness is more expensive than health, and it costs more to airlift a sick person from a remote community for critical care treatment.</p>
<p>Dr. King suggested that native leaders should be more involved in the primary surveillance of flu cases, to keep the situation from getting out of hand. And over a longer term, the social situation on reserves needs to be improved.</p>
<p>“Why should milk cost several times what it does in our big cities, and fresh fruit, vegetables barely available? And yet pop and chips are almost the same cost? Health researchers need to get involved in looking at the health effects of social determinants interventions, such as housing and education and economic development,” Dr. King said.</p>
<p>AWASH IN RED TAPE</p>
<p>To get much-needed medical supplies – be they hand sanitizers, masks, antiviral drugs or vaccines – natives living on reserves are at the mercy of an extra layer of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>In Manitoba, when H1N1 affected hundreds living on remote reserves, the province sent medical supplies to the federal government, which then sent the supplies on to the province's native communities.</p>
<p>Native leaders fear the added red tape could delay vaccine shipments to those who are among the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>Another layer of bureaucracy natives have to deal with involves jurisdiction. The federal government is responsible for funding health-care services on reserves. Doctors and nurses are provided through the provincial system.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- Aboriginal leaders are bracing for a dark season on reserves if – as health authorities fear – the H1N1 virus's spread outpaces vaccine production at the height of the flu this autumn.</p>
<p>Many remote reserves were shorted vital flu-fighting supplies such as masks, antivirals and hand sanitizers during the mild spring phase of the disease. A shortage of vaccines during the harsher fall flu season could presage a much larger catastrophe.</p>
<p>Candidates for national chief in the coming Assembly of First Nations election urged the federal government yesterday not to place aboriginals at the bottom of the queue to receive critical swine flu vaccines, or to take their time delivering life-saving drugs to reserves.</p>
<p>“When a vaccine is created, remote communities should be one of the top priorities in getting the vaccine, because they're obviously more susceptible. It's certainly a fear that it won't happen,” said John Beaucage, the grand council chief for Ontario's Anishinabek Nation. “It's certainly a fear that major urban centres will get it first and there will be huge vaccination programs in the urban centres and poor people in the remote communities will be the very, very last to get it, but maybe the first to get the disease.”</p>
<p>Asked about assurances the federal government could provide native communities regarding flu vaccines, Health Canada said it couldn't respond last night.</p>
<p>The issues around H1N1 and its impact on reserves will likely be raised at the July 22 leadership convention in Calgary.</p>
<p>Mr. Beaucage said the federal government and native communities need to look at ways to improve the health of those on reserves. “Much of the work that's done at Health Canada and various other areas seems to be more looking at the bottom dollar than it is at health outcomes,” he said.</p>
<p>The virus appears to have hit aboriginal communities harder. In Manitoba, the infection rate among aboriginals is 135 per 100,000, according to the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs. That compares with about 20 per 100,000 for the Canadian population as a whole.</p>
<p>AFN candidate Perry Bellegarde from Saskatchewan noted yesterday that if the federal government doesn't work to get medical resources much more quickly to these communities, “there's going to be an epidemic right across the North.”</p>
<p>Another candidate, Regional Chief Shawn Atleo of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations, said the “woefully inadequate supports” for aboriginal communities during the swine flu outbreak in the spring speaks volumes about the federal government's handling of other health issues on reserves, including clean drinking water.</p>
<p>Some communities have their own pandemic-response plans, but AFN candidates said that there are not enough resources to implement those plans.</p>
<p>Mr. Atleo fears that the number of H1N1 victims in aboriginal communities will grow over the fall flu season, given the housing conditions and the lack of clean water in some areas. “I fear that we'll see an overrepresentation of swine flu infection if we don't respond with very serious measures to make sure that not only is medication readily available, but that the full health supports are in place,” he said.</p>
<p>“I see that this is going to escalate. And who's it going to hit hardest? It's the impoverished. This is not the time to turn your back on the poorest.”</p>
<p>AFN candidate Chief Terry Nelson of Manitoba's Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation echoed the sentiment. “In the 1918 flu, the communities that were hardest hit were first nations communities. This will occur again.”</p>

<p>WINNIPEG -- Swine flu robbed Vanessa Bluebell of a full life and a dignified death.</p>
<p>As the body of the 25-year-old Calgary mother arrived in her birthplace on the Yellow Quill First Nation on Monday, just eight people attended the funeral. The rest of her many friends were told to stay away, cautioned that Ms. Bluebell's immediate family could still be carrying the disease that left her four boys motherless.</p>
<p>“That was tough,” said her common-law husband, Curtis Kittiekaywinnie, speaking out for the first time since the death. “The people who loved her couldn't even be there. And we couldn't even have an open casket because they thought it would spread.”</p>
<p>In myriad ways, Ms. Bluebell, who died July 9 after a 14-day bout with H1N1, has become the tragic face of a disease that preys disproportionately on the young, healthy and aboriginal.</p>
<p>She leaves behind four boys, aged 1 to 7, and Mr. Kittiekaywinnie, who is struggling for answers as to why the vivacious woman he'd loved since the two were teens died so unexpectedly.</p>
<p>“I thought it was a regular cold at first,” he said from Saskatoon, a day after the funeral in Yellow Quill, three hours east.</p>
<p>“The doctors all told us she'd be fine.”</p>
<p>That was on June 26, when an ambulance first carted Ms. Bluebell to hospital with shortness of breath.</p>
<p>“They just send her home with inhalers and stuff and told her she'd be fine,” Mr. Kittiekaywinnie said.</p>
<p>Within two days, her condition worsened. Her roommate, Alan Cote, called the ambulance again. He says paramedics dismissed her condition as, “just the flu” and left.</p>
<p>By June 29, Ms. Bluebell's skin had yellowed. She couldn't eat and continually vomited a fluid as black as tar.</p>
<p>Again, an ambulance brought her to Calgary Health Region's Peter Lougheed Centre. After looking over Ms. Bluebell, doctors quickly retracted their optimistic prognosis.</p>
<p>“All of a sudden they were saying she might not make it,” Mr. Kittiekaywinnie said. “I got really mad then. They had been saying she was young so she'd pull through. This was the girl I fell in love with when we were 14.”</p>
<p>Youth didn't seem to help. She slipped into a coma and died on July 9.</p>
<p>Health officials in Alberta said they could not speak specifically about Ms. Bluebell's case for privacy reasons. Don Stewart, spokesman for Alberta Health Services, only said that “care providers assess every patient on an individual basis.”</p>
<p>Yesterday, British Columbia announced its first confirmed swine flu death, a young child from the Fraser health region, who did have an underlying health condition. The child was admitted to hospital Sunday and died within 24 hours. A woman from the same region who had an underlying health condition has also died. H1N1 has not yet been confirmed as the cause of her death, although she lived with someone with the flu.</p>
<p>Where Ms. Bluebell contracted the virus is anyone's guess. She had travelled from her home in Calgary to Saskatoon and Yellow Quill in the days before she first came down with symptoms, but Yellow Quill Chief Larry Cachene said that the flu hasn't been very severe on the reserve yet.</p>
<p>“That's not to say we won't be hit hard this fall,” he said. “But I don't think she could have picked it up here.”</p>
<p>Mr. Kittiekaywinnie says he and his boys came down with flu symptoms as well, but unlike Ms. Bluebell, they recovered within a couple of days.</p>
<p>That made it all the harder for the youngsters to understand their mother's death. “One of the younger ones kept asking, ‘When is mom coming back from the hospital?' ” he said. “It's tough. I keep having to say ‘Mommy's not coming home. Mommy passed away.' ”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Bring health care into the 21st century; Our system is no system at all, and the SARS outbreak proved it</b>

<div>690 words</div><div>15 July 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>The outbreak of norovirus in Victoria-area hospitals and nursing homes a few months ago demonstrates what kind of suffering, hardship and operational disruption an infectious disease can have.</p>
<p>With H1N1 influenza as an even more current example, it seems a particularly apt time to ask this question: Are Victoria and British Columbia ready to bring health care into the 21st century?</p>
<p>It was six years ago that the first Canadian SARS patient died. In the aftermath, it became apparent the health-care system was ill-equipped to monitor and manage a disease outbreak, lacking a co-ordinated way to capture and share information. But the white boards and Post-It notes used at the height of the SARS outbreak are not that different from the paper-based files and records still used among a majority of health-care providers in B.C. and Canada.</p>
<p>Our health-care professionals deserve better. Almost 60 per cent of British Columbia's general practitioners surveyed recently said that patient health records were only "mostly accurate." Fifty-six per cent said that health-care delivery needed to be improved.</p>
<p>Since having the right information at the right time can make all the difference, we need to be smarter about health care -- not just when it comes to crises like the norovirus outbreak, or in the acute care setting, but also in chronic disease management, wellness, disease screening and prevention -- the whole gamut of health-care services.</p>
<p>The problem is that there really isn't a health-care "system" that links diagnosis, public-health officials, drug discovery, patients and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>The good news is that developments in technology are helping to enable integration, making it possible to capture accurate information across many systems, share it securely and privately and make it available via a variety of devices, right at the point of care, whether in the home, the walk-in clinic or even when 300 kilometres separate patient and doctor.</p>
<p>Here in Victoria, we are taking a leadership role in the development of a new solution called Panorama, which would equip public health providers with vital tools such as outbreak identification and vaccine-inventory management so they can launch a better, more co-ordinated response to the next outbreak.</p>
<p>Our province is managing this project on behalf of all Canadian provincial health jurisdictions.</p>
<p>B.C. is also moving to establish electronic health records to enhance medical care. But we cannot stop there. With these systems in place, we must take the necessary steps to create a true health-care system. For example, by applying advanced analytics to improve research, diagnosis and treatment and by building predictive systems with advanced telemetry to monitor patients in their homes, sharing data instantly.</p>
<p>Although British Columbians are among the healthiest people in Canada, now is not the time to be complacent. Waits and overcrowding in our emergency rooms and wait lists for surgeries that grow longer each day are symptoms we can't ignore.</p>
<p>Everywhere, demands of an aging population and rising costs are threatening the health-care system's ability to sustain itself. Here in B.C., if we continue on the same path, by 2017 our entire provincial budget will be consumed by health care and education alone.</p>
<p>Smart investments in health care will reap substantial benefits -- not just in greater efficiencies and cost savings, but in much improved crisis response, faster and better drug development and healthier citizens. In fact, now is the time to increase our expenditure in these areas.</p>
<p>And let's unlock our local talent as well. Victoria's technology firms and universities are hotbeds of talent. Let's look to build public-private partnerships to drive this vision forward.</p>
<p>If we can leverage the capability of smarter technologies and our smart people in B.C. to build an efficient and sustainable health-care system that actually meets the definition of a "system," future generations will thank us.</p>
<p>Greg Brophy is the senior IBM executive in Victoria.</p>

<p>NORTH AMERICA</p>
<p>PLANES INSPECTED AFTER EMERGENCY</p>
<p>NEW YORK - <span class="companylink">Southwest Airlines</span> inspected one-third of its fleet Monday night after a plane made an emergency landing in West Virginia because of a one-foot-wide hole that appeared in the body of the aircraft.</p>
<p>No other problems were found on the airline's other <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> 737-300 planes, said spokeswoman Marilee McInnis. Southwest operates 181 of the 737-300 model.</p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration have sent investigators to Charleston, W. Va., to inspect the plane in Monday's incident and determine what happened.</p>
<p>"We'll look at anything the team comes up with to see if we need to take any safety action," FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said.</p>
<p>Southwest inspected the planes after Flight 2294 was forced on Monday to make an emergency landing on its way to Baltimore, McInnis said. About 30 minutes after the flight left Nashville, Tenn., the cabin lost pressure and oxygen masks dropped from overhead.</p>
<p>The pressure drop was caused by a hole in the plane's fuselage.</p>
<p>The plane made an emergency landing and none of the flight's 126 passengers and five crew members were injured. Another plane was deployed to pick up the travellers in Charleston.</p>
<p>SOUTH AMERICA</p>
<p>30 SLAUGHTERED IN DRUG VIOLENCE</p>
<p>CIUDAD JUAREZ - An armed gang shot dead a mayor in northern Mexico, capping a vicious 48-hour period that has seen 30 people killed, including 12 police officers in the west of the country, officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hector Ariel Meixueiro, who was mayor of Namiquipa in northwestern Chihuahua state near the U.S. border, was shot multiple times after being accosted Tuesday morning by at least 15 men carrying assault rifles, according to the state prosecutors office.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday a spokesman for Mexico's public security ministry said the bodies of 12 federal police officers were found along a road in the western state of Michoacan.</p>
<p>The bodies of 11 men and one woman, who had been undertaking investigative work in the area, were found stacked on top of each other and bore signs torture, said police spokesman Monte Alejandro Rubido.</p>
<p>Officials have attributed the killings to the powerful La Familia drug cartel that operates in the region and considered one of the most violent criminal gangs in Mexico.</p>
<p>SOUTH AMERICANS MEET ON SWINE FLU</p>
<p>BUENOS AIRES - Health ministers from six South American countries were to discuss swine flu on the continent Wednesday, as Argentina's 137 deaths now have made it the second hardest-hit country in the Americas after the United States.</p>
<p>As the A(H1N1) virus continues to take hold of the region in the depths of its winter months, top health ministers from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay were to discuss "joint measures to tackle the pandemic," according to an official statement from the group.</p>
<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>COP JAILED FOR KILLING LAZIO FAN</p>
<p>AREZZO, Italy - An Italian policeman was sentenced to six years in prison on Tuesday for killing a Lazio supporter two years ago.</p>
<p>Lazio fans in the Arezzo court reacted angrily to the verdict after prosecutors had asked for a 14-year sentence.</p>
<p>Luigi Spaccarotella shot dead Gabriele Sandri at a service station following a scuffle between Lazio and Juventus fans in November 2007, prompting riots by Lazio supporters in Rome and a general crackdown on Italian soccer hooliganism.</p>
<p>TWO CONVICTED OF PEOPLE SMUGGLING</p>
<p>ROME - Two Frenchmen jailed in Italy Tuesday for smuggling illegal immigrants into the country could face a fresh trial on charges that they also planned "terrorist attacks," court officials told AFP.</p>
<p>Bassam Ayachi, 63, an imam who preached in Belgium, and Raphael Gendron, 34 were jailed for 41/2 years by a court in the southern city of Bari.</p>
<p>They were convicted of having smuggled immigrants into the country from Greece in their camping car. Prosecutors had been seeking sentences of eight years for each of them.</p>
<p>But investigating magistrates Roberto Rossi and Francesca Romana suspect they were also involved in "planning terrorist attacks and guerrilla actions" in Britain and France.</p>
<p>Among their alleged planned targets was Paris' Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport.</p>
<p>The magistrates believe that the two had access to arms and explosives and that they had set up a network to recruit and train people "ready to commit suicide actions or to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan."</p>
<p>BRITS MULL SUIT OVER PHONE-HACKING</p>
<p>LONDON - Several high-profile figures are considering jointly suing a British tabloid following reports of an alleged phone tapping scandal, a lawyer said late Tuesday.</p>
<p>Solicitor Mark Lewis said at least 20 people had made contact in the wake of allegations of illegal phone hacking by the Rupert Murdoch-owned News of the World newspaper, which sells 2.9 million copies each Sunday.</p>
<p>"At the moment there's over 20 people who have made contact," Lewis told the BBC's Newsnight program.</p>
<p>"There's talk of a class action being brought," he added.</p>
<p>The BBC program said the solicitor was acting for celebrity publicist Max Clifford, but it was not known who else allegedly targeted by the tabloid was considering their legal options.</p>
<p>The Guardian newspaper reported this month that journalists at the tabloid had hired private investigators to tap into the mobile phones of celebrities, politicians and others.</p>
<p>It said actress Gwyneth Paltrow, singer George Michael, ex-England football manager Sven-Goran Eriksson and former deputy prime minister John Prescott were among those whose messages were intercepted.</p>
<p>CENTRAL AMERICA</p>
<p>OFFICIAL QUITS AMID BRIBERY PROBE</p>
<p>KINGSTON, Jamaica - A Jamaican government official stepped down Tuesday after being implicated in a bribery scandal involving British bridge-building firm Mabey & Johnson, but he vowed to "clear my name."</p>
<p>Joseph Hibbert, Prime Minister Bruce Golding's junior minister of Transport and Works, resigned effective immediately after being linked to involvement with Mabey & Johnson and alleged corrupt business practices in the Caribbean nation.</p>
<p>"This resignation will allow me the time and freedom to clear my name and my integrity," Hibbert said in a statement.</p>
<p>The firm, which publicly admitted wrongdoing last week, has been charged in Britain with trying to influence decision-makers such as Hibbert for contracts in both Jamaica and Ghana between 1993 and 2001.</p>

<p>NIGERIAN REBELS DECLARE TRUCE</p>
<p>LAGOS Nigeria's main militant group waging an "oil war" against the government declared a 60-day truce today after the release of its leader Henry Okah under an amnesty deal.</p>
<p>"Effective 2300 Wednesday, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) will be observing a temporary ceasefire for a 60 day period," the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>A day before Okah's release on Monday, the MEND took its "oil war" into Lagos.</p>

<p>Sketchy or distorted data could cause misleading early judgments about the threat posed by swine flu, experts writing in the British Medical Journal said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>According to the UN's World Health Organization, 94,512 cases of A(H1N1) influenza have been reported, causing 429 deaths.</p>
<p>These suggest a case fatality ratio -- the proportion of deaths in the number of people known to have fallen sick -- of around 0.5 per cent, which is in the upper range for run-of-the-mill seasonal flu.</p>
<p>While not saying that the novel flu is any less -- or any more -- virulent than thought, the researchers point to "biases" in data collection.</p>

</p>
<p>The Canadian hog industry is facing virtual extinction. Should governments step in to preserve the sector or should market forces be allowed to run their course?</p>
<p>For three years, hog producers in this country have faced steady losses. Better times were always on the horizon. Just hold out and eventually hog numbers will drop enough in North America that prices will again be profitable.</p>
<p>Many analysts predicted 2009 would be the turnaround year and it was starting to look promising until the H1N1 virus, inappropriately labelled the swine flu, squashed the emerging price rally.</p>
<p>Canadian producers have been facing steeper, more prolonged losses than their American counterparts, so hog numbers still haven't dropped enough to produce a significant price improvement. American country-of-origin labelling is another thorn in the side of the Canadian industry.</p>
<p>For members of the general public, it seems like agriculture or some sector therein is always crying wolf. It's difficult for them to discern the legitimate cries for help.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: This is a sector of agriculture facing virtual collapse. Losses during the past three years have typically ranged from $10 to $50 for every market hog.</p>
<p>In the hog industry, there's nowhere to run and hide from the losses. Cow-calf producers have also had rough years, but many of these operations have off-farm income or include a grain operation. As well, cattle producers can forego a return on their investment in land and equipment to keep the operation going.</p>
<p>Hog production does not normally include a significant land base. The operations are large and typically purchase their feed grains and other inputs. With the exception of Hutterite colonies, most are stand-alone operations that can't rely on income from other sources.</p>
<p>After years of losses, support from the normal farm income stabilization programming runs thin. On top of this, the larger operations were way beyond program maximums (caps) and received minimal assistance relative to their losses.</p>
<p>There are some moderate-sized producers who have been assisted by the income stabilization schemes. There are also a few producers who locked in favourable prices earlier this year when they were briefly available.</p>
<p>In general, though, most hog operations are reaching the end of their financial rope.</p>
<p>The federal government came up with a modest program to pay producers to cull their breeding herds, but the feds have rejected any direct government aid, saying it would lead to countervail action by the Americans and make the economic situation even worse.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan has provided some additional assistance, but the losses continue to mount and producers continue to exit. Industry observers say unless governments do something more, most of the players are going to be lost.</p>
<p>Hog production units are typically large and do not enjoy a great deal of public sympathy. In fact, there are those who applaud the loss of these "factory farms." Governments can sit on their hands without much political backlash.</p>
<p>What does that say for the cattle industry? If losses continue and the beef breeding herd continues to drop, should governments also take a hands-off approach?</p>
<p>What about the grain sector? Before the comparatively good times of the last couple of years, most grain producers were in economic hardship.</p>
<p>Governments over the years have periodically come up with large, ad-hoc support programs for grain. Any support provided to the livestock sectors pales in comparison.</p>
<p>Markets are cyclical and despite the abundance of long-term optimism in the grain industry, there could again be a glut of grain that puts producers in trouble. Those of us in the grain sector shouldn't be too smug. Our turn for tough times could be coming again.</p>
<p>Will governments, particularly the federal government, be there to help or will they point to existing programs and then turn their backs, like they have done with hog producers?</p>

<p>Perhaps the most fruitless thing to ask political leaders is what long-term legacy they would like to leave.</p>
<p>Most confine their thinking to the day-to-day problems of running government or the four-year cycle of re-elections. And even if they have grander visions in mind, most are smart enough to realize that public contemplation of one's "legacy" comes across as self-indulgent and arrogant.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall definitely fits into the latter category -- a leader who, although he has surely put a lot of thought into the matter is also smart enough to realize that such musings come across to down-to-earth Saskatchewan folk as a tad presumptuous.</p>
<p>Still, Wall may already be projecting a picture of the Saskatchewan he wants to leave behind, should he be fortunate enough to serve in the province's highest office for a decade to a dozen years.</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan Party leader has mentioned increasing the province's population to 1.1 million people -- 100,000 new residents, or a growth of one per cent per year -- enough times to indicate that must be one of his goals.</p>
<p>And his repeated references to a debt-free Saskatchewan must make this another of his goals. One also gets the impression he'd like to see some physical monument left behind -- such as a domed stadium for the Roughriders to replace Taylor Field at Mosaic Stadium.</p>
<p>But one gets the sense Wall realizes none of this would transform Saskatchewan from its working class, agriculture and resource-based economy where the head offices are elsewhere. Which leads to Wall's so-far unarticulated transformative legacy focusing on three critical files -- nuclear research development, clean coal technology and biotechnology as it relates to research into vaccines and infectious disease.</p>
<p>Wall's announcement last week of a partnership with the University of Saskatchewan and the Saskatchewan Cancer Agency to put together a proposal to the federal government to address the medical isotope issue would seem to be the last of the three pieces of this vision to fall into place.</p>
<p>What Wall is proposing sidesteps the Uranium Development Partnership hearings. Moreover, given his admission that producing isotopes for nuclear medicine would only cover about of third of such a research reactor's operational costs, the proposal would seem to make it a non-starter. But in the context of this three-pronged, long-term vision to transform Saskatchewan, it might sense.</p>
<p>A 20- to 25-megawatt research reactor would be the centrepiece in what government insiders view as a potential National Centre for Nuclear Studies that would specialize in everything from nuclear medicine to radiation safety research to commercial application of smaller nuclear power units.</p>
<p>No doubt, critics would be quick to brand Wall's "research reactor" as a "gateway drug" into nuclear power because one of its roles would be to explore ways of daisy-chaining three or four smaller, more cost-efficiency 125-megawatt reactors together as a practical way of building nuclear power capacity.</p>
<p>But it would also be a perfect fit with work already being done at the U of- at the Canadian Light Source. Besides similar work in nuclear medicine, one could envision advanced research on power generation and ways to produce more cost-efficient, less-resistant electronic beams to move it.</p>
<p>Combine this with the U of S's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization work -- especially in a world of bird flu and the H1N1 virus -- and one can see a vision for the university not only as a world-class research and learning centre but also an institution that could transform the Saskatchewan economy.</p>
<p>Toss in the University of Regina's Petroleum Institute, the work at Boundary Dam on clean coal and Wall's close association with Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, and one can see a province already energy-rich with oil, gas, coal and uranium transforming into a much more carbon-friendly energy-producing province, with clean coal, wind, solar, nuclear, co-generation and biomass, all the while simultaneously building the economy.</p>
<p>Such a transformation wouldn't be easy. It would require a huge attitudinal adjustment from: "Why Saskatchewan?" to "Why Not Saskatchewan?"</p>
<p>But it's transformation that, one suspects, Wall would embrace . . . even if he's not yet publicly talking about it.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>The world's health-care workers should have priority access to H1N1 flu vaccine when it becomes available, the World Health Organization said yesterday.</p>
<p>The agency's vaccine chief skated around the dilemma of how that goal can be met, given that most countries will have little or no access for the foreseeable future to pandemic vaccine, the bulk of which has already been purchased by a short list of affluent nations.</p>
<p>Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny said the World Health Organization is working at the highest levels internationally to urge those countries to share, either by donating a portion of their vaccine or providing funds for the purchase of pandemic vaccine for countries which currently are not in the queue.</p>
<p>Dr. Theresa Tam, director general for infectious diseases at the Public Health Agency of Canada, said Canada is considering the organization's request.</p>
<p>Kieny revealed that an expert advisory panel made the recommendation -- its only recommendation on who should get priority access to pandemic vaccine -- when it met in a special session last week. The idea, Kieny said, is both to protect health-care workers and ensure health-care systems have enough healthy staff to function during a time of increased demand.</p>
<p>The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization said countries should draw up their own priority groupings for pandemic vaccine, depending on their individual situations. It suggested they might want to consider vaccinating pregnant women, people with chronic health conditions, young children and healthy adults, all of whom have been hard hit by the pandemic virus.</p>
<p>"There is identification of various options, but no ranking and no priority given to these options,'' Kieny, who is head of the World Health Organizations' initiative for vaccine research, said, reiterating that countries will need to make these choices themselves.</p>
<p>Tam said that Canada will assess patterns of infections in coming weeks before making final decisions about which groups should be where in the lineup for vaccine. Decisions will also depend on how quickly and in what quantities vaccine rolls off the production line.</p>
<p>"You may do very different prioritizations if you only have a very small amount available at any given time,'' she said in a teleconference from Ottawa.</p>
<p>It is not currently clear how quickly large amounts of vaccine will become available. That's because vaccine manufacturers are reporting they are getting a disappointingly low yield of vaccine viruses from the existing seed strains.</p>
<p>Vaccine makers are getting between 25 and 50 per cent as much virus as they get when they make seasonal H1N1 vaccine, Kieny said, adding new seed strains are being made in an effort to improve the yield.</p>
<p>"We hope at least one of them or more than that . . . will be giving higher yields that will be comparable to the ones obtained with seasonal vaccine.''</p>
<p>The New York Medical College laboratory said it is in the process of generating a new seed strain, using a new target virus. Its first H1N1 flu seed strain produced the highest yield, about 50 per cent of what is seen with seasonal flu vaccine production.</p>
<p>And the U.S. Centers for Disease Control confirmed it has made three new seed strains and will begin shipping them to manufacturers next week.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mexico's stability at risk</b>
</div><div>The Economist</div>
<div>582 words</div><div>14 July 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Over the past decade Mexico might not have enjoyed explosive economic growth, but it has achieved something equally valuable. As it has transited rather painlessly from seven decades of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party to a competitive democracy, the country has discovered a new stability.</p>
<p>Problems and poverty remain, but thanks partly to the much-maligned North American Free Trade Agreement linking Mexico's economy to those of the United States and Canada, there was quiet progress. Most Mexicans can now claim to be middle-class.</p>
<p>This stability looks in jeopardy. A crackdown on drug trafficking, launched by Felipe Calderon after he narrowly won the presidency in 2006, has provoked a wave of violence. Efforts to create a new, uncorrupt police force are moving slowly. Worse, Mexico has been deeply hurt by recession, mainly because much of its industry is tied to the sickest segments of the U.S. economy - cars and construction - while its migrant workers north of the border are sending less money home. And now swine flu has knocked out the tourist industry. The economy is set to shrink by around six per cent this year. Unemployment is soaring.</p>
<p>Unlike the last deep recession in 1994-1995, this one was not caused by Mexico's own mistakes. But that is little comfort. Last time the economy bounced back quickly. That might be harder now. Border security checks are slowing trade flows; violence might discourage foreign investors.</p>
<p>None of this means that Mexico is about to become a failed state, as some analysts in Washington have suggested. But the country does risk losing its hard-won stability. If the recession drags on, the risk of social turmoil will rise. The worry is that economic and sociopolitical instability might start to feed on each other.</p>
<p>Despite all this Calderon remains popular. He is a decent man doing a difficult job. He has pushed through modest reforms of energy and education. But that was not enough for his party to avoid defeat in last week's midterm election. The PRI and its allies now have a majority in the lower house of Congress - which writes the budget - whereas the president's party lacks the numbers to veto legislation. This hardens political deadlock.</p>
<p>Mexico cannot afford three more years of political drift. Calderon should invite the PRI to join a government of national unity to force through some long-overdue measures, including tax reform, a further energy reform to bring in private investment, a more powerful competition authority and the adaptation of the constitution to democracy. The PRI has a powerful incentive to collaborate. In 2003 it won a midterm election by a similar margin. Confident of a return to the presidency, it played a spoiling role in the following legislature only to come third in the 2006 election. A display of statesmanship could persuade Mexicans that the PRI deserves to be granted executive power again.</p>
<p>In all this the United States is more than a bystander. What happens in its populous southern neighbour is of vital interest. Barack Obama has said that America should do more to halt the southward flow of guns and laundered money to the traffickers. Indeed it should. It also needs to spend more on infrastructure to speed legal trade across the border. Economic integration might seem like a disadvantage now. But it can speed recovery and help Mexico hang on to its imperiled stability.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>British health officials on alert as 'healthy, fit' girl, 6, dies of swine flu; 10,000 cases around Britain, with 17 fatalities</b>
</div><div>Daily Telegraph</div>
<div>773 words</div><div>14 July 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>E10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Parents were urged not to panic Monday night after swine flu apparently claimed the life of a fit six-year-old girl.</p>
<p>Chloe Buckley, from west London, was described as "perfectly healthy" in the days before she started feeling ill.</p>
<p>She saw her doctor last Wednesday, complained of flu-like symptoms and died the following day.</p>
<p>Her death, a significant escalation in the spread of swine flu, is certain to alarm parents as she is the first child without other health problems to die.</p>
<p>Health experts called on the public not to panic, but warned that there would be more deaths.</p>
<p>It was also announced that Dr. Michael Day, 64, from Bedfordshire, had died after contracting the disease.</p>
<p>Tests have proved that both had the H1N1 virus and post-mortem examinations are now being carried out to determine the exact causes of death. If they are found to have died directly from swine flu, rather than other underlying causes, it will take the number of deaths in healthy patients to three, after another person died on Friday.</p>
<p>Speaking after news of Chloe's death, Simon Tanner, regional director of public health for London, said: "The Health Protection Agency is now seeing large numbers of people with the virus. This will probably not be the last death."</p>
<p>Nearly 10,000 Britons have been confirmed as suffering swine flu, but hundreds of thousands more are feared to have the virus.</p>
<p>It has been linked to 17 fatalities.</p>
<p>The government has given warning that the number of cases could rise to 100,000 a day by the end of next month and eventually affect one in two people.</p>
<p>Enough vaccine has been ordered to cover the entire population, with the first doses arriving next month and half of all doses expected to be given by the end of the year.</p>
<p>A spokesman from the National Health Service would not disclose whether Chloe had been treated with the antiviral flu drug Tamiflu.</p>
<p>St. Catherine's Roman Catholic Primary School, in West Drayton, where she was a pupil, has been closed early for summer despite national guidance that affected schools should remain open.</p>
<p>Chris Spencer, director of education and children's services at Hillingdon council, said: "It's an exceptional set of circumstances. This is a little girl who until a few days ago in all our minds was a child that was perfectly healthy."</p>
<p>He refused to comment on reports that Chloe had been sent home from her family doctor with tonsillitis.</p>
<p>Chloe, who would have been seven on Friday, was the youngest child of devout Catholic parents Michael, 40, and Jacinta, 37.</p>
<p>Sara Benn, headmistress of St. Catherine's, said: "It is impossible to put into words the sorrow that the whole school feels.</p>
<p>"Chloe was a bright and tenacious student with a keen interest in sports. She will be missed by her fellow pupils and her teachers. Our thoughts are with her parents and family."</p>
<p>Day, a married father of five who lived in Stanbridge, is understood to have been suffering with a cold, but was taken to hospital on Saturday and died the same day.</p>
<p>A local general practitioner since 1974, he had retired, but worked privately. All patients who had been in recent contact with him are being clinically assessed.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Hassan, senior partner at Priory Gardens Health Centre, said: "We are completely devastated.</p>
<p>"Dr. Day was a work colleague and also a personal friend to everyone at the practice."</p>
<p>Dr. Laurence Buckman, chairman of the BMA's general practitioners committee, offered his condolences to Day's family and said it was necessary to stay calm.</p>
<p>"It is very important that members of the public do not panic, and continue to follow health advice about swine flu and managing it if they are infected. The vast majority will recover quickly by taking paracetamol or ibuprofen and drinking plenty of fluids."</p>
<p>Professor Ian Jones, of Reading University, said: "All respiratory infections are potentially serious. However, we have to be careful not to conclude that the death of an individual with swine flu is a death because of swine flu."</p>
<p>A Department of Health spokesman said anyone thinking they may have the disease should carry tissues, use a clean one to cover their mouth and nose, throw it away after one use and wash hands often with soap and hot water.</p>
<p>Sufferers should stay at home and contact their doctor by phone unless they get worse, officials suggested.</p>

<p>Stop smoking and get active -- not just good advice for a long life. It is the best way to prepare for what might be a serious flu pandemic this fall.</p>
<p>With disease experts worrying that H1N1 may mutate into something more ferocious in the coming flu season, even efforts by veteran nicotine addicts to cut the amount of smoking will make a difference, perhaps keeping a smoker out of the hospital or leading to a faster recovery. Each cigarette smoked does a little more damage to lung tissue, placing them at elevated risk from the H1N1 virus circulating.</p>
<p>To date, disease experts have stressed the fundamentals of infection protection for the public, romper room basics such as washing your hands often, and also covering your cough and sneezes to prevent spreading your germs to others. Workplaces should be telling employees to stay home if they are sick, to nip in the bud infections within the office.</p>
<p>Not a lot of attention has been paid to what those with underlying health conditions, such as chronic illnesses, can do to protect themselves. H1N1 has spread in Canada for months, and as the summer wends on, the virus may change into a more powerful foe. Unlike seasonal flus, which usually hit babies and the elderly hardest, H1N1 is hitting the stronger, healthier population.</p>
<p>General health vigilance took on greater weight this week with news that manufacturers at work on a vaccine are getting less yield from the H1N1 seeds. That could reduce the amount available globally in November, the predicted ready date for a vaccine.</p>
<p>People with diabetes, lung conditions (such as asthma or emphysema), heart conditions and those taking corticosteroids for serious inflammatory diseases, such as severe arthritis, are at higher risk of getting seriously sick with H1N1, which infects the respiratory tract. Pregnant women, particularly in later stages, are inclined to pick up flu viruses, as well, and are at higher risk from H1N1. People who drink to excess also put themselves at risk from infections.</p>
<p>The best piece of advice for those with compromised health, like everyone, is to get physically active -- walking is an easy form of exercise -- and eat well. Keeping weight in check and losing extra pounds relieve stress on the body. Those with chronic diseases ought to take their medications appropriately; those suffering with asthma, for example, should be taking the daily preventive drugs as prescribed now to keep the lungs strong for the flu season. Those at higher risk should call their family doctors for advice and, if they get sick, should check in with primary health providers early to avoid falling serious ill. Medical specialists can help with advice tailored to individuals with specific health concerns, such as hepatitis or HIV.</p>
<p>Governments are working on protocols for hospitals which could see resources such as staff, beds and equipment -- particularly ventilators -- taxed to serve all those who may get seriously sick. A severe pandemic would force medical personnel to make tough decisions on who gets what level of care.</p>
<p>The best personal strategy is to stay out of the hospital, away from the line ups where someone is deciding what a strained health system can offer. Get healthy, master the bad habits and keep the chronic disease in check -- routine advice that has extra currency in the personal planning for the pandemic.</p>

<p>A city in decline</p>
<p>I am sorry the young men who came here to work have had a had such a bad taste of what our city is becoming. I have lived here for over 40 years and have witnessed the gradual decline, which seems to have escalated over the last few years.</p>
<p>The punks who vandalize and steal cars, spray paint property, etc., are never punished. The streets everywhere are covered in litter and spilled drinks -- isn't there a law against littering? Some streets are never cleaned. In my area of Osborne Village, the sand and gravel have not been cleaned from the winter.</p>
<p>Our heritage buildings are left to disintegrate and then are demolished to make way for more ugly buildings or parking lots. Likewise the parks and the zoo deteriorate. We have the trees, the history of The Forks, a few heritage buildings that have been allowed to survive, and yes once upon a time streets that were cleaned on a regular basis. But unless these things are cherished, they are doomed.</p>
<p>This is why people have lost all respect for the city they live in. When law and order is lost and our elected officials turn a blind eye to the decay, then anarchy prevails.</p>
<p>We are becoming complacent and it's time for the citizens of Winnipeg to stand up and demand more accountability from the premier, the mayor, city council and the law.</p>

<p>Need over culture</p>
<p>Bravo to Lindor Reynolds for her article Child must come first, not unfit parents (July 10). She echoes my sentiments exactly. I can understand the reasoning behind CFS's wish to have aboriginal children cared for in homes where they will be exposed to their own culture.</p>
<p>It would be fine if these children were placed in homes where they are loved and their culture is celebrated. However, far too many children are placed (often several times) in homes where they are exposed to sexual abuse, violence and drug and/or alcohol abuse. Surely no one wants any child raised in this sort of a "cultural" environment. It is time for CFS to give the basic needs of children top priority. Culture does not fall into this category.</p>

<p>Dangerous hijinks</p>
<p>In the Arts and Life section of the Sunday paper there was a picture of a young woman at the Folk Festival swinging her child by the arms. While we all do this in fun, few of us realize the damage that can be done to the child.</p>
<p>Radial head subluxation, or nursemaid's elbow, is a dislocation of the elbow joint caused by a sudden pull on the extended arm. This can happen when lifting a child up from the ground by the hand or wrist, swinging a child while holding him or her by the hands or wrists or pulling a child along in a hurry or when a child collapses to the ground in an effort to avoid going with their parent. It can happen quite easily and is very common.</p>

<p>Beer but no bread</p>
<p>I have discovered something that bothers me. Do you all know that you can only buy groceries until 6 p.m., but you can buy beer until 12 a.m. on a Sunday night? I was surprised about the late time for the vendor to be open. It is also open on most holidays, on some of which grocery stores must be closed! I am hopeful something will be done to change this.</p>

<p>Hospitals' unsung heroes</p>
<p>I very much enjoyed On the flu front lines (June 28). All of the staff involved in caring for these patients deserve a huge pat on the back. However there are many other professions that also deserve recognition for their role, such as the respiratory therapists, physiotherapists, unit assistants, X-ray technicians, housekeeping. As a respiratory therapist myself, I commend the respiratory therapists across the province of Manitoba for their contributions in the flu fight.</p>
<p>This is a group of dedicated professionals who are often overlooked by the media and the public. Most are unaware of our existence and our function. Respiratory therapists operate and monitor the ventilators in the intensive care units.</p>
<p>Most patients admitted to the ICU will receive care from one. Patients on ventilators require a respiratory therapist's care around the clock. Respiratory therapists are an important part of the intensive care team, participate in rounds every day and are involved in making decisions on how to best ventilate their patients.</p>
<p>With the flu crisis upon us, they are faced with an ongoing heavy workload. H1N1 patients have proven to be especially difficult to manage, even with state-of-the-art ventilators. In addition, every H1N1 patient is in isolation. The respiratory therapist must use a fresh gown, gloves and mask each time the room is entered. With the huge increase in isolated patients in ICU, this is a substantial increase in workload. In order to cope, additional respiratory herapists have been scheduled on most shifts. Staff have been extraordinary in their response and willingness to cancel time off, to work overtime and in some cases to voluntarily cancel vacation. Respiratory therapists also work in many other areas of the hospitals and community. We see patients from all ages, neonatal, pediatric, adult, and geriatric. In fact, any time a patient has distressed breathing, mild or life threatening, acute or chronic, chances are a respiratory therapist will be involved in his/her care at some time.</p>

<p>Ombudsman needed</p>
<p>I read Paul Thomas's article regarding a health care ombudsman with great interest. What especially caught my interest was that Concordia hospital eliminated its patient representative position three years ago.</p>
<p>When my elderly mother was in that hospital for two months, I could not get an answer to any question through the attending doctor. He refused to return messages both at the hospital as well as at his office. I contacted the head of medicine at the hospital and, again, no reply. A nurse got me in touch with the patient representative and I finally got some answers. It is a joke that Concordia eliminates this position and then claims that staff as a whole should be communicating with patients and families when I know that the communication at Concordia is zero.</p>
<p>I would hope that Mr. Thomas's idea for a heath-care ombudsman would be implemented and that the minister of health would order Concordia to reinstate the patient representative.</p>

<p>Is this the vision of our city for which Mayor Sam Katz is withholding tax increases? Not my Winnipeg. Please sir, you can raise my taxes if you promise to help our inner-city kids.</p>

<p>The Obama administration is showing a leadership on the H1N1 influenza that is lacking in Canada. Where is the evidence that Canada is taking the swine flu seriously?</p>
<p>The White House has communicated a sense of rising to a deadly challenge. President Barack Obama participated by telephone from Italy last week in an H1N1 Influenza Preparedness Summit. Cabinet secretaries of health, homeland security and education joined in. So, too, did health and school officials from around the United States. The governors of several states, linked by video screens, asked questions. Swine flu is apparently an urgent matter.</p>
<p>Nothing like what the U.S. leaders said has been uttered by their counterparts in Canada. “The potential for a significant outbreak in the fall is looming,” Mr. Obama said. “We want to make sure that we are not promoting panic, but we are promoting vigilance and preparation.” “We must avoid complacency,” said Kathleen Sebelius, Health and Human Services Secretary. “This flu is not over,” said Thomas Frieden, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>By failing to express a similar urgency, Canada's leaders are indicating it is okay to be complacent. In Saskatoon, a 25-year-old mother of four young children died of swine flu after being sent home from hospital, raising questions about medical vigilance and readiness. There has been no broad-based preparedness summit in Canada. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has not spoken out on the issue. The public has not been invited to witness a question-and-answer session with officials across the country.</p>
<p>“Canada is well prepared for these events thanks to years of advanced planning and close co-operation with provinces, territories and health professionals across the country,” David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, told a news conference on June 11. “The degree of collaboration we've seen has been unprecedented.”</p>
<p>Canadians are asked to accept that on trust. In the U.S., people can actually watch and listen to the collaboration. While Canadian officials pat themselves on the back in public, their behind-the-scenes efforts suggest reasons for grave concern. Ventilators, and the people who maintain and provide them, are expected to be in short supply. Guidelines are being drafted to help medical officials decide who gets prime access to life-saving treatment and who has to wait. “We may be faced with two young persons competing for the same health-care resources,” Theresa Tam, of the Public Health Agency of Canada, told this newspaper. That is a cause for concern, surely.</p>
<p>In the United States, the schools are speaking in public with health officials, and the President himself, who has no shortage of other issues on his plate, is discussing plans and urging vigilance. Washington is even offering a $2,500 prize for the best YouTube public-service announcement. The country is engaged. In Canada, by contrast, leaders meet privately and occasionally emerge to say comforting words, which leaves Canadians on their own to wonder, and worry.</p>

<p>The signs of a community in mourning for a young mother would not have been immediately obvious to anyone driving onto this First Nation Monday.</p>
<p>But inside the band hall, a subdued crowd of people who knew and loved 25-year-old Vanessa Bluebell sat on the floor with their food in front of them, partaking of a feast in her honour.</p>
<p>Bluebell's family members are not interested in speaking publicly about her life in the media, said her uncle, Leonard Basanapiness, who works at the reserve's small health centre.</p>
<p>A paper sign on the building's front door announces the cancellation of the First Nation's upcoming summer games, due to "pandemic."</p>
<p>Calgary newspapers have already published a story about his niece, Basanapiness said Monday.</p>
<p>"Let her rest in peace."</p>
<p>Bluebell, a mother of four who grew up at Yellow Quill and moved to Calgary about two years ago, died July 9 from the H1N1 flu. Health officials said she had no previously existing medical conditions that would have contributed to her death.</p>
<p>A friend, Stella Peeace, told Calgary reporters that Bluebell likely caught the deadly flu during a trip to Yellow Quill last month.</p>
<p>Peeace said she drove Bluebell and her children to the reserve for the June 10 funeral of a cousin who'd been killed in a car crash.</p>
<p>Peeace said Bluebell was already sick and "thought she had the flu" when she returned to Calgary on June 23. When her symptoms kept getting worse, Bluebell's husband called an ambulance on June 27.</p>
<p>Peeace said Bluebell was sent home with an inhaler from her first hospital visit, without being tested for the virus.</p>
<p>Two days later, her spouse called another ambulance. She was admitted to Calgary's Peter Lougheed Hospital June 29. Subsequent tests confirmed the flu, but she then fell into a coma and did not regain consciousness.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>NDP reign guaranteed: poll - Tories, Grits fail to trumpet issues that appeal to voters</b>
</div><div>By Bruce Owen </div>
<div>799 words</div><div>13 July 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>Premier Gary Doer's New Democratic government is still riding high in public support despite stinging criticism for its handling of photo radar in construction zones and the 1999 election expenses rebate controversy that dominated the legislature's spring sitting, a Winnipeg Free Press-Probe Research poll concluded.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted at the end of June, showed the NDP retains its position as the first choice among voters.</p>
<p>Specifically, it said nearly one-half of Manitoba voters (44 per cent) indicated they would vote for Doer's New Democrats if an election were held today.</p>
<p>In keeping with other polls, the NDP enjoys more support in Winnipeg than the Tories, but the Tories excel over the NDP in support in rural Manitoba.</p>
<p>The NDP continues to enjoy an eight-point lead over rival Hugh McFadyen's Progressive Conservatives and a 30-point advantage over Jon Gerrard's Liberals despite a noisy session that left the New Democrats somewhat battered.</p>
<p>This represents a slight decrease (-2 per cent) from the NDP's result in Probe's last quarterly survey, but it is within the statistical margin of error.</p>
<p>The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points and is accurate 19 times out of 20. It was conducted June 8-25 of 1,000 Manitoba adults.</p>
<p>"By all accounts this was a tough legislative session," Probe Research president Scott MacKay said. "These guys were just being hammered."</p>
<p>MacKay said the poll shows that the two issues picked by the opposition to attack the government found little resonance outside the halls of the legislature.</p>
<p>The use of photo radar cameras by police to ticket speeders in construction zones and the Elections Manitoba probe into the 1999 election, in which the NDP counted free union workers as expenses instead of donations in kind and ultimately agreed to repay $76,000 in public subsidies, didn't dent Doer's armour.</p>
<p>MacKay said Manitobans generally support the use of photo radar and likely find the election rebate debate too complicated or too old to pay much attention.</p>
<p>Neither will have much impact in helping the Tories and Liberals gain any momentum over the NDP, he said.</p>
<p>Premier Gary Doer said Manitobans are more concerned about the economy and the H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Weeks ago, it was the spring flood.</p>
<p>"We feel on the big issues people are concerned about, people genuinely think the government is on track," Doer said.</p>
<p>"We're not perfect. We're not pretending to be perfect. We do make mistakes," he added.</p>
<p>Doer described the photo radar debate as a "bucking horse" that was difficult to rein in.</p>
<p>A positive consequence is new police statistics that show drivers are slowing down in construction zones and fewer tickets are being issues this year from last.</p>
<p>"It definitely got more attention, at our own expense perhaps," he said. "That's the way it goes. That goes with the job."</p>
<p>Tory director of media relations Liz Peters said poll results mean little as the province is still more than two years from the next election -- and a lot can happen between now and then.</p>
<p>"As Manitobans get to know us better, we're confident we will be very competitive in the 2011 election," she said.</p>
<p>Liberal Leader Jon Gerrard, whose party's support is stuck at 14 per cent, said he detects a lot more disquiet than is evident at the polls and believes NDP support is softening.</p>
<p>"People are pleased that the economy isn't doing worse than it could but there are accumulating issues, especially in health care," Gerrard said.</p>
<p>Doer added the NDP's internal polling shows the government is tracking slightly better than the Probe poll.</p>
<p>"Our own internal stuff shows us in and around where we were at the election," he said. "But that doesn't mean to say we're one vote behind in every bloody seat."</p>
<p>He said that poll was done at the end of June and shows the position of the New Democrats halfway through their current mandate since the May 2007 election. The next election is Oct. 4, 2011.</p>
<p>The NDP occupies 36 seats in the 57-seat legislature. The Tories have 19 and Liberals have two. Last March, the NDP easily won two byelections -- Elmwood and The Pas.</p>
<p>MacKay said the NDP's popularity may slip when Doer decides to leave politics.</p>
<p>"It will be like a political earthquake," he said. "A lot of their popularity rests with him."</p>
<p>Doer's been premier since 1999 and is Canada's longest-serving current premier.</p>
<p>He has repeatedly said he's running in the next election.</p>

</p>
<p>The death of a 25-year-old Calgary mother from the H1N1 virus has left her family reeling and wondering how the otherwise-healthy young woman could have been struck down by the flu so suddenly.</p>
<p>Vanessa Bluebell died in hospital early Thursday just days after being admitted, leaving behind four sons ages 1, 3, 4 and 7.</p>
<p>“We all thought she would just pull through this,” said Alvita Kittiekaywinnie of Saskatoon, whose brother, Curtis Kittiekaywinnie, was Ms. Bluebell's common-law partner.</p>
<p>Ms. Bluebell had been visiting family in Saskatoon with her children when she developed a cough during the second week of June.</p>
<p>The family returned to Calgary about two weeks later, and Ms. Bluebell's cough continued to worsen.</p>
<p>By June 27, Mr. Kittiekaywinnie called an ambulance to their home to take her</p>
<p>to hospital, where she</p>
<p>was given inhalers and sent home.</p>
<p>Within a day of leaving the hospital, Ms. Bluebell began having seizures and her partner called an ambulance again.</p>
<p>After her death, Mr. Kittiekaywinnie told their children their mother wasn't coming home.</p>
<p>“The two middle ones still don't really understand,” their aunt said.</p>
<p>“But the oldest boy, he's pretty sad.”</p>
<p>She said the family doesn't understand why Ms. Bluebell wasn't admitted for the flu when she first arrived at the hospital.</p>
<p>“It seems like they should have taken her illness more seriously,” she said.</p>
<p>“Maybe if they had treated her that first night, she would still be here.”</p>
<p>Ms. Bluebell's family was originally from the Yellow Quill First Nation near Saskatoon, where her funeral will be held today.</p>

<div>FLU OUTBREAK</div>

<div id="hd"><b>Ottawa boosts pandemic prep with new rules for treatment; Public Health developing plans to help doctors prioritize who gets access to scarce treatment if vaccine isn't ready</b>
</div><div>GLORIA GALLOWAY </div>
<div>STAFF CP</div>
<div>976 words</div><div>13 July 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- For the first time in decades, doctors across the country will be given rules to help determine which patients get access to life-saving treatments in the event an influenza pandemic hits the country hard this fall.</p>
<p>Drafting these rules signals how seriously Canadian health authorities take the H1N1 virus, which they fear could become deadlier and more widespread during flu season.</p>
<p>Experts say there is a strong likelihood that a vaccine will be in place by November to stop an H1N1 pandemic from taking down large segments of the population.</p>
<p>But the effectiveness of preventive medicine is by no means a certainty. Production of a vaccine has already hit a snag, with manufacturers reporting a disappointingly low yield when the virus is grown in eggs, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>To be prepared in the event a pandemic does take hold, the federal and provincial governments are developing a plan which stipulates, among many other things, that guidelines be developed to assist doctors in making tough choices about the allocation of scarce treatments.</p>
<p>“There may come a point where there is definitely an overcrowding situation where triaging has to occur if you have limited resources,” Theresa Tam, director general of infection disease and emergency preparedness for the Public Health Agency of Canada, told The Globe and Mail in an interview.</p>
<p>Some of the work to develop the rules around triage has already been done, said Dr. Tam. It is primarily the job of the provinces, but the federal government is assisting by providing information.</p>
<p>“We knew that we had to pull together a multidisciplinary group” to analyze the potential situations, she said, “because you have legal issues, clinical issues, ethical issues that have to come together.”</p>
<p>With most diseases, it is the elderly and the infirm who are worst affected. But the H1N1 virus has a predilection for people in their prime. On Friday, public health officials issued a warning telling pregnant women that it is hitting them with peculiar ferocity.</p>
<p>“We may be faced with two young persons who may be competing for the same health-care resources, and those are some of the questions that we will be facilitating discussions on,” Dr. Tam said.</p>
<p>The primary fear of health officials is that a flu pandemic will follow the same course as the Spanish flu, which arrived in a mild form in the spring of 1918 and then mutated into something far more vicious when traditional flu season returned in the fall of that year.</p>
<p>In the end, an estimated 50 million people were killed worldwide, including 50,000 in Canada – or 0.6 per cent of the population. If the 1918 experience were replicated this year and 0.6 per cent of the Canadian population fell seriously ill, that would be close to 200,000 people.</p>
<p>Respiratory technicians say there are not enough members of their profession currently practising in this country to care for patients during an influenza pandemic. Nor, they say, are there enough critical-care nurses.</p>
<p>The public-health agency is looking at ways to bring health professionals out of retirement, getting students fast-tracked into the work force, and allowing credentials to be accepted across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Some doctors have also suggested that the problem of finding enough ventilators will pale in comparison to finding enough isolation rooms.</p>
<p>In fact, said Dr. Tam, isolation rooms are unlikely to be needed because hospitals could simply close off entire wards or wings and devote them to influenza patients. Under that scenario, it is the number of ventilators that has many health experts worried.</p>
<p>There is no official tally of the machines in Canada, and Dr. Tam said there is no point in counting those that are not attached to critical-care beds because a ventilator needs trained personnel to operate it. By using a number of different mathematical models, she and her staff have concluded that there are about 3,500 to 4,500 ventilators in Canada that could be used in a pandemic.</p>
<p>Some doctors say their H1N1 patients require oscillating ventilators that push air into patients' lungs in short, rapid bursts rather than the long, slow breaths afforded by the regular machines.</p>
<p>The public-health agency is purchasing 370 of the regular ventilators to add to the federal stockpile of 130 that can be distributed to the provinces as needed. Dr. Tam said the regulators will be selected with ease of transportation and operation in mind. The agency expects to spend about $10,000 per machine.</p>
<p>The Respiratory Therapy Society of Ontario questions that choice.</p>
<p>“Any true critical-care ventilator capable of managing the pulmonary insult that the H1N1 virus has produced comes at a minimal cost of approximately $40,000,” the society said in an e-mail.</p>
<p>“The devices that are around the $10,000 range are typically used for transport or management of patients who require ventilatory support, but do not suffer from any pulmonary compromise. As a result, these devices are not capable of properly oxygenating (provision of oxygen to the blood) or ventilating (removing carbon dioxide from the blood) critically ill patients.”</p>
<p>That debate is likely to continue into the fall as health officials assess the severity of the flu.</p>
<p>In the meantime, governments will continue to write the rules around triage. But Dr. Tam does not assume any guidelines developed in the coming months will eliminate the burden faced by doctors who may have to make life-and-death decisions.</p>
<p>“While we can have maybe some high-level guidance, it doesn't make the job of the people on the ground that much easier,” she said.</p>

<p>As someone who handled communications for a major airline during the SARS crisis of 2003 and also spent time dealing with other crises for a major university medical centre, I read Dr. Mark Joffe's comments regarding the H1N1 virus with great seriousness.</p>
<p>I'm afraid Joffe is right when he says that this virus may prove to be the major health challenge of the past 40 years. All too afraid.</p>
<p>Given the strength and growth H1N1 is demonstrating worldwide, no one should think health professionals are going overboard and doing too much to protect people. Let's just hope we are doing enough, and quickly enough.</p>

<p>People who are obese but otherwise healthy may be at special risk of severe complications and death from the new H1N1 swine flu virus, U.S. researchers report in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's weekly report on death and disease. They described the cases of 10 patients at a Michigan hospital who were so ill they had to be put on ventilators. Three died. Nine of the 10 were obese, seven were severely obese, including two of the three who died.</p>
