<p>China quarantined more than 130 of the 150 passengers aboard a flight that carried a Chinese man who was the mainland's first suspected case of H1N1 flu, the Xinhua news agency said today. The 30-year-old man's girlfriend, father and a taxi driver had also been quarantined, said Xinhua, which cited officials at a press conference held in the provincial capital of Chengdu, in southwestern China. The man took a <span class="companylink">Northwest Airlines</span> flight from Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota which stopped in Tokyo and landed at Beijing. He also took a flight on <span class="companylink">Sichuan Airlines</span> from Beijing to Chengdu.</p>

</p>
<p>H1N1 flu has infected 4,379 people in 29 countries, the World Health Organization said Sunday, as five more Canadians tested positive, all of them in the Prairies.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada reported three new cases in Alberta and two more in Saskatchewan, bringing the national total to 286.</p>
<p>The UN agency, meanwhile, said Mexico has reported 1,626 confirmed cases, up from 1,364 on Saturday, and repeated that 45 people have died there from the new flu strain that is a genetic mixture of swine, bird and human viruses.</p>
<p>The Mexican government has said the worst is over and eased restrictions on commercial and public activity in the country that has been at the epicentre of the outbreak.</p>
<p>The health organization's latest flu tally increased the number of confirmed infections in the United States to 2,254 from 1,639 reported on Saturday, while the number of reported deaths remained at two.</p>
<p>However, U.S. officials on Saturday said a man died from the new flu in Washington state last week, bringing the toll in the United States to three.</p>
<p>Also Sunday, China reported its first suspected case of H1N1 flu, a Chinese man in Sichuan province who had returned from studying in the United States.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old man was being treated in a hospital in provincial capital Chengdu and has been placed in quarantine, the health ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>In Japan, meanwhile, three Japanese citizens returning from Ontario became the first confirmed cases of the virus in Japan.</p>
<p>Last week, Japanese authorities quarantined a 46-year-old male teacher and two students, both 16, who had been on a high school trip to Canada. The teacher and students had stayed in Oakville, west of Toronto, from April 24 until last Thursday. They are recovering, officials said.</p>

<p>Experts Question the WHO's Eagerness to Hit the Pandemic Button</p>
<p>For those who have followed the swine flu outbreak, it has almost become a daily ritual, as routine as the morning weather forecast.</p>
<p>Each day, at roughly 11 a.m., a senior official from the World Health Organization, often speaking in a dry, matter-of-fact tone, has appeared on TV screens to update the world on the outbreak.</p>
<p>But as fears of a catastrophic pandemic wane, some medical experts are questioning the apocalyptic statements that have occasionally emerged from WHO's otherwise subdued press conferences.</p>
<p>'Sometimes some of us think WHO stands for the World Hysteria Organization,' said Dr. Richard Schabas, who was Ontario's chief medical officer of health from 1987 to 1997. 'There seems to be a culture at WHO where they've convinced themselves that a pandemic is such an imminent danger that they overreact.'</p>
<p>Perhaps the most sensational statement by WHO came on April 29, the day the UN agency raised its six-point pandemic alert to Phase 5, meaning it believes a global pandemic is 'imminent.' Calling on all countries to 'immediately activate their pandemic-preparedness plans,' WHO director-general Margaret Chan reminded the world, 'It really is all of humanity that is under threat during a pandemic.'</p>
<p>The quote, which was qualified with assertions that the world is in many ways prepared for such a threat, hit the 24-hour news cycle with all the subtlety of a neutron bomb -- triggering ominous headlines in newspapers and newscasts around the world.</p>
<p>This week, WHO officials appeared to tone down their rhetoric in the face of mounting evidence the outbreak might be milder than originally thought.</p>
<p>Chan has defended her statements, saying it's her job to be cautious.</p>
<p>'I'm not predicting the pandemic will blow up, but if I miss it and we don't prepare, I fail. I'd rather over-prepare than not prepare,' she told the Financial Times newspaper</p>

<p>Two children with mild symptoms have become the latest to test positive for the new H1N1 flu virus in Saskatchewan. That brings the total number of cases in the province to four. The latest cases surfaced in the Prince Albert area, north of Saskatoon, and the <span class="companylink">Heartland Health</span> Region, southwest of the city. Health officials weren't immediately available to comment on the ages of the children or whether they had travelled to Mexico. Earlier this week, a teenage girl in the Saskatoon area and a woman in her mid 20s became the province's first H1N1 flu cases. Both had travelled to Mexico and have recovered from mild cases of the illness.</p>

<p>Re: 'Bettman vs. Balsillie' or any of the other eight stories, an editorial or editorial cartoon regarding NHL hockey in Hamilton in the front section</p>
<p>It has been some time since we have seen a media circus such as the one we are witnessing.</p>
<p>H1N1, recession, C. difficile, Barack Obama, Osama bin Laden -- all have had their place within our local media and rightfully so. However, none have exploded onto the forefront as quickly as has this old and boring story of Hamilton landing an NHL team.</p>
<p>It has reared its ugly head once again and new websites -- such as makeitseven.ca -- as well as Hamiltonians' hopes are undoubtedly on the rise. But they will all ultimately come crashing down quicker than the TSE.</p>
<p>I admit I was one of those original hopefuls who was crushed when Ottawa was awarded a team in 1990. Yes, I wore one of those white painter's caps in support of a Hamilton franchise.</p>
<p>But let's face it -- Hamilton will never get a team. There is still a better chance of finding "weapons of mass destruction" than Hamilton landing an NHL team.</p>
<p>I know that makes me about as popular as Simon Cowell with the American Idol audience, but it just won't happen. So don't let this media frenzy con you into thinking otherwise.</p>

<p>Confirmed death toll: Global total of 53 -- 48 in Mexico; three in the United States; one in Canada and one in Costa Rica. One of those who died in the U.S. was a toddler from Mexico.</p>
<p>Confirmed cases in Canada: 286 (56 in Nova Scotia, 76 in Ontario, 79 in British Columbia, 49 in Alberta, 16 in Quebec, four in Saskatchewan, three in Prince Edward Island, two in New Brunswick and one in Manitoba).</p>
<p>Confirmed cases elsewhere: More than 4,500 in 29 countries, including at least 1,626 in Mexico and at least 2,532 in the United States.</p>
<p>Latest developments:</p>
<p>* Alberta's chief veterinarian says just under 500 hogs have been culled on the pig farm where the new swine flu virus was detected -- not because the animals were sick, but because of overcrowding on the farm.</p>
<p>* Japan reports its first four cases: a teacher and three students who had been on a high school trip to Canada.</p>
<p>* China reports its first suspected case in a Chinese man returning from studying at a U.S. university.</p>
<p>* High schools, universities, dance halls, movie theatres and bars have reopened across Mexico. Primary schools will reopen next week.</p>
<p>Misconceptions: Air travel is considered safe, provided it's not to Mexico, for healthy people. Those with flu symptoms are advised to stay home. Authorities also say there's no reason to keep healthy children home if there's no flu at school.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Free emergency kits for top civil servants nixed</b>
</div><div>Toronto Star</div>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>A plan to give free 72-hour emergency survival kits to some of Ontario's highest-paid civil servants at taxpayer expense has been quashed by Community Safety Minister Rick Bartolucci.</p>
<p>The move came after the Toronto Star obtained an internal government document on the plan, part of emergency preparedness week and "especially timely given the current H1N1 flu virus," said the memo, which also cited recent emergencies such as last summer's propane explosion in North York.</p>
<p>"We are not impressed," said Laura Blondeau, a spokesperson for Bartolucci.</p>
<p>The kits from the government agency Emergency Management Ontario were to go to deputy ministers of government departments, more than two dozen in all, who sit on the deputy ministers' council.</p>
<p>It's not unusual for deputy ministers -- the top bureaucrats in their departments who make more than their cabinet minister bosses -- to earn $200,000 or more a year. Ministers make about $160,000.</p>
<p>The free kits were part of an effort "to ensure that all senior executives of the OPS (Ontario Public Service) are better prepared at home so we can ensure our collective ability to serve Ontarians through any crisis that might occur," said the May 5 memo from deputy community safety minister John Burke.</p>
<p>That is fine, but not at taxpayer expense in a recession, said Blondeau.</p>
<p>"We don't agree with that."</p>
<p>The deputy ministers can prepare their own kits just like other Ontarians by going to the website Ontario.ca/beprepared and looking up what to buy, she added, noting the kits cost at least $75 each and contain everything from candles, a blanket, a crank-operated radio, can opener, soap, canned goods, toilet paper and more.</p>

</p>
<p>HALTON REGION</p>
<p>Three out of four communities in Halton have been touched by swine flu as the region's confirmed cases jumped to five this weekend.</p>
<p>The region announced Saturday that three more people have tested positive for H1N1 influenza A.</p>
<p>Hamilton did not report any new cases on the weekend, leaving the city's tally at one infected individual.</p>
<p>Halton's new confirmed cases include two students and a young man in his 20s.</p>
<p>All are recovering at home.</p>
<p>"There truly is community spread," said Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton's medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"It is out in the community. It isn't localized to one area or one school or anything like that."</p>
<p>One of the new cases attends the same school as a student previously confirmed to have the flu.</p>
<p>Nosal would not say whether that was Christ the King Catholic School in Georgetown or Lorne Skuce Public School in Oakville.</p>
<p>Halton, which has more than 450,000 residents, is made up of Burlington, Oakville, Milton and Halton Hills. Georgetown is in Halton Hills.</p>
<p>Nosal said four student cases are spread over three schools in two communities.</p>
<p>That means the two new cases are located in Halton Hills, Oakville or both.</p>
<p>The young adult lives in a third community, he said, meaning the man resides in Milton or Burlington.</p>
<p>Nosal said a letter would be sent home to parents at the third school with a confirmed flu case today.</p>
<p>None of Halton's five cases have a travel history of going to Mexico, nor have they been in contact with each other, Nosal said.</p>
<p>Nosal believes more swine flu cases will be confirmed in the region.</p>
<p>"I fully expect, as we speak right now, there are a number of other people who either are incubating or are ill with influenza-like illness," he said.</p>
<p>"We are awaiting ... quite a few more lab test results, and we very well may have more cases to report."</p>
<p>Canada now has 286 confirmed cases of the swine flu that has spread to nearly 30 countries.</p>
<p>The Ontario numbers only included two of the new cases from Halton.</p>

</p>
<p>In the 2006 federal election campaign, desperate Liberals unveiled a goody bag of pledges for Manitoba to stave off defeat at the hands of the surging Conservatives.</p>
<p>There was money for an expanded Red River Floodway, funding for the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, and a $125-million expansion of the Winnipeg-based Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health, home to the National Microbiology Laboratories and headquarters of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).</p>
<p>Manitoba Tories were circumspect about how they would treat these pledges. "A Stephen Harper government takes Manitoba issues very seriously," said Conservative party president Don Plett, one of Manitoba's most influential Tories. "We're not going to turn our backs on any important issue."</p>
<p>Three years later, Plett's pledge appears reasonable. All the money for the floodway was provided. And Harper not only matched the Liberals on capital funding for the human rights museum, but added annual operating grants.</p>
<p>However, the Tories have failed profoundly on the lab expansion. The plan envisioned a new laboratory wing and a lowrise office tower. Ottawa put $250 million in its last budget to upgrade federal laboratories, but could find only $24 million to expand the Winnipeg lab's loading dock.</p>
<p>To characterize that announcement as a disappointment would be a gross understatement. Many are left to wonder why the federal Conservatives would turn their backs on one of Manitoba's most important federal facilities. Theories abound.</p>
<p>One theory holds that federal Tories are simply unwilling to increase funding for science and technology in these economically trying times. In January's federal budget, funding for research and development was cut. It was a particularly bad decision, given the fact the European Union and the United States are massively increasing science funding as a key component of recession-fighting stimulus programs.</p>
<p>Another theory says that federal Tories, including Manitoba's senior cabinet minister Vic Toews, believe Manitoba has received more than its fair share of federal funding through the floodway and the human rights museum.</p>
<p>Under pressure to find money for a wide range of priorities, Toews has been inexplicably aloof about the lab expansion, and it's possible he believes it's too big a ask on the heels of the floodway and human rights museum.</p>
<p>A final, perhaps more credible theory suggests that Health Canada is blocking the lab expansion as part of a dispute over who actually controls PHAC.</p>
<p>Health Canada fought the original decision to build the lab in Winnipeg. Years later, resentment over that decision manifested in an all-out effort to stop the Liberals from locating the PHAC headquarters in Winnipeg. The Liberals believed it was better to locate Canada's top scientists and public health experts away from the stifling bureaucracy of Ottawa.</p>
<p>Nearly four years later, however, and it's quite clear that Ottawa isn't giving up without a fight. During the H1N1 flu virus scare, Dr. David Butler Jones, the chief medical officer of health, and Dr. Frank Plummer, the director of the National Microbiology Laboratories, have been anchored in Ottawa while scientific work is done in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>The optics could not be clearer. It would be infinitely more difficult to fight Winnipeg for control of PHAC if the Winnipeg laboratory were improved and expanded.</p>
<p>However, Health Canada is oblivious to the fact an expanded lab is a critical issue for some of the world's best and brightest scientists.</p>
<p>When the proposal was made to expand the Winnipeg lab, one of the main reasons was that the top scientists working there needed more space and unless they got it, they would leave.</p>
<p>Last year, quietly and without fanfare, Dr. Heinz Feldmann left the NML and the University of Manitoba for the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, a U.S. National Institutes of Health research facility in Hamilton, Montana, to continue his research into a vaccine to treat hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola. Feldmann made international headlines when he developed a vaccine prototype working out of the Winnipeg lab.</p>
<p>Now, he toils in the U.S., where he has more money and access to a much larger Level 4 laboratory. Feldmann has never spoken publicly about his decision, but the motivation seems clear.</p>
<p>Whether the decision to shelve the laboratory expansion is due to cynical regional politics, a failure to recognize the economic importance of investments in science, or a failure to curb Ottawa bureaucrats, the Harper government has dropped the ball here.</p>
<p>Expanding the NML is good for Manitoba, good for science and good for Canada's economy. Perhaps one day the folks in Ottawa will see that and get out of the way.</p>

<div>THE FLU OUTBREAK</div>

<div id="hd"><b>Pigs culled at quarantined Alberta farm; Worker who had been in Mexico in April somehow transmitted virus to hogs when changing barn vents</b>

</p>
<p>CALGARY -- The impact of the influenza A H1N1 virus has been particularly acute on the Van Ginkel family farm in central Alberta where about 500 hogs have been slaughtered and sent for rendering.</p>
<p>Arnold and Alida Van Ginkel, who left Holland in 2003 in search of a better life in Canada, sadly agreed to the cull because of concerns about animal welfare, and after discussions with federal and provincial officials. Their barns near Rocky Mountain House had become overcrowded with 3,000 pigs as their 220 sows continued to give birth to piglets, which were banned almost two weeks ago from making it to market.</p>
<p>Their farm has the misfortune of being the only in the world to have flu virus in pigs that was contracted from humans. It remains under quarantine.</p>
<p>“Two weeks ago, our dream turned into a nightmare after it was found out that our hogs were exposed to the H1N1 virus,” Mr. Van Ginkel said in a statement released over the weekend. “Right away we called in our farm vet after we saw some of our hogs were sick.”</p>
<p>The family business is tottering after about 450 animals in the herd tested positive for the virus, according to a report by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.</p>
<p>“This has been a very difficult time for our family and we will continue to work with the government to get through this,” Mr. Van Ginkel said. Local carpenter Adrian Blaak, who had returned from Mexico where he was helping build churches on April 12, was changing vents in the family's barn on April 14. That was long before the world learned about a so-called swine flu originating from Mexico.</p>
<p>Mr. Blaak, who ended up spending a week in bed after the job, somehow transmitted the virus to the hogs. He twice tested negative for the virus, something health officials said was likely because he was assessed long after the illness passed through his system. Other farm workers also tested negative. The Van Ginkels and their six children are also fine.</p>
<p>But around the world, the number of confirmed cases and deaths continues to climb.</p>
<p>There are now 4,379 confirmed human cases of the infection in 29 countries, including 49 deaths, the bulk in Mexico and the first death in Costa Rica, the World Health Organization said yesterday morning. Japan counted its first cases over the weekend including a teacher and two students who were returning from a school trip to Ontario.</p>
<p>But the overall numbers, which grew by 1,000 cases in one day, could be even higher. Later yesterday, the United States reported its third death and hundreds more confirmed cases. The Public Health Agency of Canada said this country now has 284 confirmed cases, including one death.</p>
<p>Back in Alberta, John Middel, a hog farmer who spoke to the media on the Van Ginkel family's behalf, said his friends did everything they could to stop the spread of the disease from their farm and asked for privacy.</p>
<p>During an interview with The Globe and Mail last week, Mr. Van Ginkel denied knowing anything about the infected farm, but said that the government should order a mass cull – and offer compensation to the affected farmer – to improve the image of Canada and the struggling pork industry.</p>
<p>“I think they should get rid of the herd and then you can show everybody there's not a problem,” he said.</p>
<p>Gerald Hauer, Alberta's chief provincial veterinarian, told reporters that the limited cull of healthy animals and ones that had recovered from the flu was undertaken after other measures, such as the construction of a temporary shelter, were ruled out.</p>
<p>“The rendering will kill the virus. It's 100 per cent safe, but we felt there was a need to handle perception so we're going to take those products and dispose of them as well,” he said.</p>
<p>The farmer will be compensated for his loss. The quarantine will be lifted when the virus has run its course.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Flu Q & A</p>
<p>Q – What happened to “Patient Zero,” the little boy whose picture was all over the news?</p>
<p>A – Edgar Hernandez, from the dusty town of La Gloria, had his 15 minutes of infamy, but, alas, he is not “Patient Zero.” The cute kindergartener fell sick at the end of March and he turned out to be the first person whose blood sample tested positive for swine influenza A H1N1. Activists who oppose a giant hog farm near La Gloria quickly blamed it for the swine flu, and the media beat a path to little Edgar's door.</p>
<p>But scientific papers now being published about the novel flu virus show, among other things, a confirmed case dating back to March 17 in the Veracruz region of Mexico, well before the boy fell sick. The first confirmed case in the United States was March 28 in California. The first death was on April 12 in Oaxaca, two weeks before the swine flu started making international headlines.</p>
<p>Q – Why do the media keep saying the situation is improving if the number of cases of A H1N1 continues to climb?</p>
<p>A – The numbers being published are cumulative: They include all the cases of swine flu in the world dating back to mid-March. There is also a backlog in testing. So, while the World Health Organization said yesterday that there were 4,379 cases of influenza A H1N1, you have to bear in mind that only a tiny number of those people are actually sick. Most have recovered. Even the “new” death reported in Canada was more than a week ago, and the test was done posthumously. There are many indications as well that the number of new cases is slowing, indicating the epidemic has peaked.</p>

</div><div>By Carol Sanders   </div>

</p>
<p>University of Manitoba's Max Bell Centre is bursting with brain power as 475 budding scientists from across Canada compete in the 48th annual Canada-Wide Science Fair.</p>
<p>Winnipeg hasn't hosted the national science fair -- Canada's largest extracurricular youth-science event -- since 1988.</p>
<p>On Sunday, students in grades 7 to 12 from every province and territory went to work setting up their science-fair project displays.</p>
<p>"I've never been anywhere outside of B.C.," Shakti Ramkumar, 12, said as she knelt on the floor of the Max Bell gym putting the finishing touches on her display posters. The first-time science fair participant from Surrey, B.C., has come up with a global accounting method to cap and trade each household's ecological footprint.</p>
<p>"It's a measure of our demand on the Earth's resources," said the girl, whose family immigrated to Canada from India four years ago.</p>
<p>"We're using more than the Earth can replenish."</p>
<p>Ramkumar is one of the 475 finalists from 102 regional science fairs that were held across the country in March and April. Five students from Manitoba are taking part.</p>
<p>Many of the projects address concrete problems found in our everyday lives. The students compete in a variety of categories, including life sciences, health sciences, physical sciences, biotechnology, engineering, computer science and the recently added environmental innovation category. They range from the poetic and practical to the creepy.</p>
<p>A Nova Scotia student found "a healthy alternative to road salt" by mixing ash with road salt to mitigate damage to the environment. An Ontario participant has attached a battery charger to a running shoe for a project dubbed "Power Walk".</p>
<p>Nearby, "A Model for Human Decomposition in Fresh Water and Salt Water" shows photos of immersed pork hocks in various stages of rot.</p>
<p>Nicholas Randall, from B.C., measured the strength of the probiotic benefits of different brands of yogurt at various stages leading up to their expiry dates.</p>
<p>Some of his research required the use of an autoclave -- an apparatus using superheated steam under high pressure -- which his scientist mother had to help him with.</p>
<p>The high-tech research doesn't surprise Richard Cuthbert, co-chairman of the science fair host committee.</p>
<p>"I have seen an increase in complexity," said the U of M graduate student, who's been involved in the provincial science fair for a decade.</p>
<p>"The students move quickly" to embrace new technologies and research methods, he said.</p>
<p>The standards are high, and so are the stakes. The students compete for close to $1 million in scholarships and grants. And they forge friendships with fellow science buffs from across the country -- and around the world.</p>
<p>Students from countries outside Canada also participate in a special international category for the experience, Cuthbert said.</p>
<p>"It's an opportunity for those students... to speak with researchers from Manitoba and Canada and receive feedback," he said.</p>
<p>Taiwan and Australia are taking part this year, but Mexico cancelled at the last minute because of the H1N1 flu epidemic.</p>
<p>"Mexico decided not to at the last minute... They wouldn't compete -- just in case," Cuthbert said.</p>
<p>He said two students from Mexico didn't want to take any chances of infecting hundreds participants.</p>
<p>"It's disappointing. It's a great opportunity for those students to meet students from across Canada," Cuthbert said.</p>
<p>Winners will be announced at the awards ceremony on Friday from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. at the Canad Inns Polo Park.</p>
<p>The public will be able to visit the students and their projects Saturday from 9 a.m. till noon at the Max Bell Centre.</p>

</p>
<p>Earlier this month, I was quarantined for suspected swine flu by Chinese officials in Dandong, at the Korean border.</p>
<p>It was a swift and decisive administrative act that separated me from my tour group in a remote city in China and placed me under medical observation in a local hospital. This in a place where I neither spoke nor understood the language nor the local geography, and with a non-refundable return ticket home on a plane flying in 36 hours. I was in their hands.</p>
<p>I had the misfortune of having a cold that was peaking just as I crossed an international border, exactly seven days – the incubation period for</p>
<p>A/H1N1 virus – after transiting an American airport.</p>
<p>As our train rolled across the border into the Dandong station, it seemed like an attack from Mars: Our carriage was swarmed by beings in yellow, orange, green and blue isolation suits. Outside, the train was surrounded. Inside, they split into teams methodically checking every compartment. They entered the compartment of our tour group, blocked the door and waved small plastic gun-like devices. These they pointed at our foreheads and “fired.”</p>
<p>The gun displayed a body temperature reading. Mine was high enough to cause a huge commotion. A space man, through his goggles and respirator, informed me that I must come into quarantine. Half a dozen of the space aliens escorted me to a nearby ambulance, accompanied by a Chinese woman from our tour group who volunteered to come with me as an interpreter.</p>
<p>The train was delayed in the station, and the spectacle of my removal was watched by all those aboard. Once in the ambulance, we whizzed through the streets with lights flashing and sirens screaming. One of the attendants (I couldn't tell whether male or female under the gear) spoke of a brother in Toronto.</p>
<p>When the ambulance reached the hospital there was more commotion, and we didn't enter for several hours. Meanwhile, various aliens approached regularly to take my temperature and fill out forms. We later learned the delay was caused by the apparent need to evacuate the entire hospital wing in which I was to be quarantined. While waiting, the aliens brought us an enormous quantity of KFC meals. “Don't throw the garbage around, though,” they said. “This is an ambulance and we have to keep it clean.”</p>
<p>Inside the hospital, I was placed in a basic but clean private room where I spent the night. I had a colour television and a window that opened to a view of the main street. I saw a man transporting a pile of mattresses two stories high in the most improbable way on his bicycle. The streets were busy with traffic, new cars in every make and model. Like everywhere in the new China, the skyline was punctuated with building cranes. It was the Chinese labour day weekend and through the urban smog, fireworks raked the sky.</p>
<p>A space alien delivered more KFC.</p>
<p>Next morning, I smoked and enjoyed the view. They don't have a problem with smoking in China and I felt pretty comfortable.</p>
<p>Again a being in protective gear delivered KFC. At this point, the bed was a mountain of fried chicken meals of every variety, tubs of coleslaw and bags of fries. The being told me she had a nephew in Vancouver.</p>
<p>They X-rayed me and took blood tests. The temperature checks continued. More KFC arrived.</p>
<p>About noon, a young man in gear entered the room. He removed his mask, smiled and introduced himself as a representative of the Chinese department of external affairs. “I worked at the consulate in Toronto for two years, very nice city,” he said.</p>
<p>I now had a clean bill of health. He had been in contact with his counterpart in Ottawa to keep the Canadian government informed. He apologized profusely for any inconvenience, and advised that we merely awaited final approval for my release.</p>
<p>When that came, a group of uniformed officials accompanied us, again in a lights-and-sirens ambulance parade, to the train station. Officialdom had already procured me a timely train ticket in a comfortable first-class carriage to catch my flight in Beijing. They whisked us through the station and directly onto the train.</p>
<p>Before I left, a high-ranking officer in uniform approached me and bowed with great grace and dignity. “Please,” he said, “come back to China.”</p>
<p>Throughout my stay in the country at the start of my trip, and especially at this point, I was impressed by the unfailing courtesy, politeness, helpfulness and efficiency of Chinese officials. I don't question the decision to place me under quarantine, which turned out to be a pleasant adventure with VIP treatment. I enjoyed my little hospital vacation in China.</p>
<p>Last time there was an international pandemic threat, China was criticized for failing to take decisive and timely action. This time appears to be different.</p>

</p>
<p>A highly placed Ontario source was lamenting not long ago how a lot of the fun and most of the characters have disappeared from politics. How highly placed? Let's just say he pulls rank on the deputy premier.</p>
<p>That's why Cheri DiNovo - in the largely personality-free zone that is the Ontario Legislature - stands out like, well, a colourful Tibetan dress, a bracing dose of radical rhetoric and a set of pipes worthy of a pulpit.</p>
<p>Which is not to suggest that the appeal of the NDP member for Parkdale-High Park is universal.</p>
<p>DiNovo can be - as with most inveterate disturbers of the comfortable and status quo - a pious pain in the hindquarters.</p>
<p>But say this: working from the cozy confines of the 10-member NDP caucus, taking up the cause of any underdog who comes along, happy to wear her heart on her sleeve, as outraged by the ear-splitting here-and-now of construction piledrivers outside homes in her riding as she is by the more notorious of history's horrors, DiNovo gives her constituents full value.</p>
<p>DiNovo, first elected in 2006, is a United Church minister who follows in a worthy tradition - not least in the NDP and the CCF from which it sprang - of preachers turned politician.</p>
<p>The rest of her curriculum vitae is a little unorthodox - drug-smuggling street kid to entrepreneur to wife (twice), mother (twice) to theology degree, clergy, author, radio host. And say this also: the Radical Rev, as her radio show was known, can rattle the rafters.</p>
<p>In a place where too many MPPs rise to read eye-glazing prefab bromides and avoid spontaneity as they would swine flu, DiNovo riffs off the cuff and from the heart.</p>
<p>She takes the serious personally and the personal seriously, frequently threading stories from her experience as pastor into debates.</p>
<p>This was rarely more gripping than when DiNovo recently told of counselling a survivor of the Holodomor famine in Ukraine, a woman who thought herself unforgivable because she'd eaten human flesh to survive.</p>
<p>On her feet, the 58-year-old Toronto native has both a sense of theatre and sense of occasion.</p>
<p>When 12 Holocaust survivors were recently honoured in the Legislature, DiNovo turned in her place to face and speak directly to them - rendering her words at once less easy and more meaningful. "It's fitting that I say something as a Christian. Really, it could be summed up by saying, 'mea culpa.' I am sorry; we are sorry."</p>
<p>She said sorry for the anti-Semitism that has been part of Christian theology, for anti-Semitic signs that once dotted Toronto, for the doors that were barred and the humiliations that were inflicted.</p>
<p>And in the Speaker's gallery, the visitors wept.</p>
<p>As DiNovo fights against payday loan gougers, York University fat-cats, any overlord anywhere, she knows the value of media exposure - forever tugging reporters over to meet Tibetan-Canadians, or the impoverished, or aggrieved citizens from her riding.</p>
<p>She also knows the value of a well-turned phrase. She despairs, she said during Sexual Assault Prevention Month, of a society that won't adequately fund transition houses for abused women, but would launch a royal commission if hockey players were getting hurt at the same rate.</p>
<p>DiNovo has little patience for the self-satisfied modest starts and half measures that so often seem the best government can manage. In truth, she was probably born to be in opposition. The limitations and necessary compromises of office would make her miserable.</p>
<p>It is dearly to be hoped that her recent appointment as Deputy Speaker, with its formal robes and comfy chair and demand for balance, doesn't rub her edges off.</p>

<p>It was a scourge that decimated families and shut down Windsor.</p>
<p>One family lost nine people, the Border Cities Star reported.</p>
<p>William Welcher died Christmas Eve, his five-year-old daughter, Susie, on Christmas Day. They were buried together.</p>
<p>Mrs. James Oliver died on a Tuesday and her husband on Thursday. They left their 18-month-old daughter, Iline.</p>
<p>Many of the victims were cut down in the prime of life.</p>
<p>Three hundred people fell sick in Ford City the first month. A month later, 93 people in the border cities had died. At one point, for the first time ever, there were more deaths than births.</p>
<p>Hotel Dieu Hospital ran out of room, so a home for war veterans was turned into a hospital.</p>
<p>Public meetings were banned, schools and churches closed and hundreds of homes were quarantined.</p>
<p>Sneezing and coughing in public buildings were prohibited.</p>
<p>The scourge? It was the flu.</p>
<p>Of all the dreaded diseases through history, the Spanish influenza of 1918 was Earth's worst pandemic, infecting one-third of the world's population and killing 20 million to 40 million people from the Arctic to remote Pacific islands.</p>
<p>People died, sometimes within hours, "struggling to clear their airways of a blood-tinged froth that sometimes gushed from their nose and mouth," wrote a medical student.</p>
<p>The flu, often confused with the common cold, is a deadly disease, killing about 4,000 people every year in Canada.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it's very deadly. Flu killed a million people in 1957; 700,000 in 1968.</p>
<p>The problem is we never really know what this tiny virus, which looks like a sphere with spikes, is going to do.</p>
<p>There are parallels between the Spanish flu and the current swine flu, says University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown.</p>
<p>Both could infect pigs and humans and both hit young adults.</p>
<p>But no one knows what this strain will do because flu is highly unpredictable and very deceptive.</p>
<p>That's why scientists, public health officials and governments don't underestimate it.</p>
<p>The flu is like a chameleon, always changing, and that's what makes it so dangerous.</p>
<p>It has eight genes, and when it lands in your respiratory tract, latches onto one of your cells and reprograms it to produce more virus, it makes mistakes, called mutations.</p>
<p>One mutation happens every time it replicates a full set of genes.</p>
<p>That's a lot, says Brown.</p>
<p>Although each mutation is small, they're incremental, and some enable the virus to function better, for example, attack more aggressively or adapt to hosts and replicate more easily. In the right environment, for example winter, when people are indoors and the air is dry, it becomes more virulent.</p>
<p>Flu viruses from different species -- humans, birds, pigs -- can also be thrown together in one animal, where the genes become jumbled, producing a new virus. It's called viral sex, and while most viruses don't do it well, flu does, meaning it can evolve faster and more dramatically, Brown says.</p>
<p>Most of the changes are minor, called drifts.</p>
<p>That's why a new vaccine is needed every year. But sometimes -- and no one can predict when -- a radically new virus emerges, called a shift. There is no immunity.</p>
<p>And all this happens just by chance. You can see why the director general of the World Health Organization has warned we must remain on alert.</p>
<p>So why is H1N1 killing people in Mexico, and most victims here don't even need treatment? Again, we don't know all the reasons why some flu is so lethal, says Brown. Scientists at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg have decoded the genes of H1N1 and haven't found the markers for virulence seen in previous pandemics.</p>
<p>It could be poor nutrition. It could have combined with other infections. Mexicans could simply differ genetically and be more susceptible.</p>
<p>Will there be a pandemic? Interestingly, the Ontario government has asked University of Guelph mathematician Chris Bauch to predict how the virus will spread.</p>
<p>Bauch writes a mathematical formula depicting the cases so far and comes up with projections based on different scenarios. It's like using physics to figure out how a cannonball will fly through the air, he said.</p>
<p>The key is the "R-zero," the number of people who can be infected by a single person. In a pandemic, it's two. That might not seem high, but it becomes exponential. Do the math.</p>
<p>So far, the R-zero of H1N1 is 1.5, about the same as seasonal flu. It could be the structure of the virus. Or it could just be because it's spring. The Spanish flu was mild when it began in the spring -- and devastating when it returned that fall.</p>
<p>Now we have anti-viral drugs and antibiotics to fight secondary pneumonia. But, says Brown, modern medicine has yet to be tested by a bug like the Spanish flu.</p>

</p>
<p>H1N1 flu has infected 4,379 people in 29 countries, the World Health Organization said on Sunday, as five more Canadians tested positive, all of them in the Prairies.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada reported three new cases in Alberta and two more in Saskatchewan Sunday, bringing the national total to 286.</p>
<p>That could change, said Anne Schuchat, an interim deputy director at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Whether the virus comes roaring back in a nastier form depends in part on whether its traits hold steady, mutate or mingle with the deadly H5N1 bird flu in Asia, Schuchat said.</p>
<p>The UN agency meanwhile said Mexico has reported 1,626 confirmed cases, up from 1,364 on Saturday.</p>
<p>It repeated that 45 people have died there from the new flu strain that is a genetic mixture of swine, bird and human viruses.</p>
<p>The Mexican government has said the worst is over and eased restrictions on commercial and public activity in the country that has been at the epicentre of the outbreak.</p>
<p>The health organization's latest flu tally increased the number of confirmed infections in the United States to 2,254 from 1,639 reported on Saturday, while the number of reported deaths remained at two.</p>
<p>However, U.S. officials on Saturday said a man died from the new flu in Washington state last week, bringing the toll in the United States to three.</p>
<p>Also Sunday, China reported its first suspected case of H1N1 flu, a Chinese man in Sichuan province who had returned from studying in the United States, China's Health Ministry said on Sunday. The 30-year-old man was being treated in a hospital in provincial capital Chengdu and has been placed in quarantine, the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, three Japanese citizens returning from Ontario became the first confirmed cases of the virus in Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese authorities quarantined a 46-year-old male teacher and two students, both 16-year-old youths, who had been on a high school trip to Canada. The teacher and students had stayed in Oakville, west of Toronto, from April 24 until last Thursday. The teacher was being given Tamiflu while the two students were recovering, officials said.</p>
<p>Forty-nine others who were aboard their flight on Friday from Detroit to Tokyo were also quarantined.</p>
<p>The number of cases in B.C. jumped by 19 on Saturday, followed by 15 in Ontario, four in Alberta and one in Quebec. The big jump in B.C. comes as technicians got caught up with lab work, the B.C. Centre for Disease Control said.</p>
<p>After Sunday's numbers that brings the national total to 286 infections: 79 in B.C., 76 in Ontario, 56 in Nova Scotia, 49 in Alberta, 16 in Quebec, three in P.E.I., four in Saskatchewan and two in New Brunswick, and one in Manitoba.</p>
<p>While most infections, including five in the Windsor area, are mild and haven't required hospitalization, Canada's first death related to the H1N1 virus was reported Friday: Tina L'Hirondelle, a 39-year-old woman on the northern Alberta Metis settlement of Gift Lake, who died April 28. Officials with Alberta Health and Wellness said she had checked herself into hospital in High Prairie, Alta., with asthma problems.</p>

</p>
<p>Five more Canadians -- all on the Prairies -- tested positive for swine flu yesterday, as the World Health Organization dramatically increased its census of the number of people infected by the H1N1 virus to 4,379 people in 29 countries.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada reported three new cases in Alberta and two more in Saskatchewan, bringing the national total to 286. There have been 79 relatively mild cases in B.C.</p>
<p>WHO said Mexico reported 1,626 confirmed cases yesterday, up from 1,364 on Saturday. Forty-five people have died in Mexico while suffering from the flu strain that is a genetic mixture of swine, bird and human viruses.</p>
<p>Saying the worst is over, the Mexican government eased restrictions last week on commercial and public activity.</p>
<p>WHO's latest flu tally increased the number of confirmed infections in the United States to 2,254, up from 1,639 reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Washington state man in his 30s with the flu who died last week was from Snohomish County, north of Seattle, officials said. The unidentified man suffered from unrelated heart problems. He was the third person to die in the U.S. while suffering from the flu.</p>
<p>Yesterday, China reported its first suspected case of H1N1 flu, a man in Sichuan province who had returned from studying in the U.S.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old man is being treated in a hospital in provincial capital Chengdu and has been quarantined, the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>B.C.'s 79 cases lead the country, followed by 76 in Ontario, 56 in Nova Scotia, 49 in Alberta, 16 in Quebec, three in P.E.I., four in Saskatchewan, two in New Brunswick and one in Manitoba.</p>
<p>On May 2, Alberta recorded the first instance of the strain being found in pigs, about 450 of which were infected by a worker returning from Mexico.</p>
<p>On Saturday, chief Alberta veterinarian Gerald Hauer announced that nearly 500 pigs have been killed on the same farm -- not because they had become sick, but because of overcrowding caused by a quarantine brought on by the infection.</p>

<p>Jordan</p>
<p>Pope urges Christians</p>
<p>to aid peace process</p>
<p>Pope Benedict visited the site on the Jordan River yesterday where Jesus is believed to have been baptized and urged Christians in the Middle East to play a role in seeking peace.</p>
<p>Jordan's King Abdullah and Queen Rania met the pontiff at the spot southwest of the Jordanian capital Amman and showed him around the archaeological site.</p>
<p>Today, Benedict moves on to Israel and the Palestinian territories for the most delicate part of his Mideast trip. Its main theme so far has been Christian-Muslim relations.</p>
<p>Iran</p>
<p>Jailed journalist's lawyer</p>
<p>hopeful about appeal</p>
<p>A lawyer for a jailed American journalist in Iran said yesterday he was "optimistic" an appeals court will reduce Roxana Saberi's eight-year prison sentence for allegedly spying for the U.S.</p>
<p>Abdolsamad Khorramshahi talked to reporters after Saberi's five-hour closed-door appeals hearing. He said he was allowed to defend her and expects the court will make its ruling in coming days.</p>
<p>Saberi, 32, who grew up in Fargo, N.D., was convicted last month after a closed-door hearing that her father said lasted only 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Iceland</p>
<p>New government to look</p>
<p>at EU membership</p>
<p>Iceland's new coalition government said yesterday it will ask parliament to vote on whether the recession-hit country should start membership talks with the European Union.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir said a bill authorizing talks would be introduced when Iceland's parliament resumes sitting on Friday.</p>
<p>Negotiations on forming a coalition government had earlier snagged on whether Iceland should seek to join the 27-country EU, seen by many as the country's best route out of its financial crisis.</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>Last 1970s SLA radical</p>
<p>released on parole</p>
<p>James William Kilgore, 61, the last captured member of the Symbionese Liberation Army - the 1970s-era radical group notorious for bank robberies, killings and the kidnapping of newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst - was released on parole from prison yesterday after serving a six-year sentence for the murder of a housewife during a 1975 bank robbery. Kilgore was arrested in 2002 in South Africa.</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>Former overseas student</p>
<p>feared to have H1NI flu</p>
<p>China has reported its first suspected case of H1N1 flu, a 30-year-old man in Sichuan province who had returned from studying in the United States, the health ministry said yesterday.</p>
<p>He has been placed in quarantine in a hospital.</p>
<p>H1N1 flu has infected more than 4,300 people in 29 countries, the World Health Organization said yesterday, increasing its count by almost a thousand in a day.</p>

<p>Clink. Clink. Clink. Clink.</p>
<p>That was the sound of Jeremiah Pick's deposit in a donation box on the way into K-os's show at Kool Haus Saturday night.</p>
<p>"A buck. Four quarters," the 19-year-old music student unabashedly told a hovering reporter.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was just a down payment, until he assessed the rapper's performance on this novel free-entry, pay-what-you-want "Karma Tour"?</p>
<p>"'Fraid not. I'm down to my last six bucks," Pick explained. "This is the third time I've seen K-os for free. It's beautiful. I love his music."</p>
<p>Fortunately, his were rare empty pockets. About two-thirds of the people the Star saw enter the venue in a half-hour period pulled out bills at the donation station, which also accommodated credit and debit cards.</p>
<p>Tim, a.k.a. "Karmamanager," inveigled concertgoers with a stack of CDs in each hand. Every contribution yielded Yes! It's Yours, a disc of 11 fan remixes from K-os's acclaimed new disc Yes!</p>
<p>"If someone is willing to play for me, I'm willing to pay for it," said Dunja Illic, 18, of her $20 gift, even though she admitted to downloading most of the music she listens to for free.</p>
<p>"The tour has to be paid for. And this is a deal. I don't expect to go to a concert and pay less than $30 to $40."</p>
<p>Customer service rep Tina Joelle, 25, was among those who said her post-show payment would "depend on how good it is." And then she planned to allot the deserving combination of the two $10 bills she carried to the David Suzuki Foundation, which had a table set up with volunteers collecting names and emails.</p>
<p>"I think this is a pretty interesting concept," Joelle said. "I don't know how he can afford to do it, but it gets a lot more people out."</p>
<p>Not as many as you might expect, though. With no advance tickets sold, the lineup was around the block, but everybody got in. The 2,500-capacity venue was about 65 per cent filled for the Whitby native's 75-minute set. This would have been a sold-out $35 ticket at the half-the-size Phoenix that 17-year-old Olivia Vasquez would have missed. With a $30 limit, this was a risk-free opportunity for her to check out an intriguing but unfamiliar artist.</p>
<p>Those who paid according to their appreciation of K-os's work got their money's worth, because the more familiar you were with his synthesis of hip-hop, pop and rock, the more satisfying the concert.</p>
<p>Before a plain backdrop inked with a giant YES! and a genuine colour-changing traffic light, the rapper bounded to the mic, bounced around like a boxer, then cut a workman-like swath through his four-album catalogue. Highlights included new tune "I Wish I Knew Natalie Portman" and 2004 hit "Crabbuckit," which he called "some karaoke s t."</p>
<p>Save a one-song appearance by rapper Saukrates and the Burt Bacharach and Naughty By Nature quotes, there was little fat or frivolity in the two-time Juno winner's approach. Newcomers would have been impressed as much by the singing emcee's versatility - he occasionally supplemented the fierce five-piece band on synth, harmonica and guitar - as by his clever rhymes, which included a swine flu reference.</p>

<div>Issues & Ideas</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Grading a pandemic; It's now been a fortnight since Swine Flu hit us. How have we handled it, and what have we learned?</b>
</div><div>Peter A. Singer   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>854 words</div><div>11 May 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>It's been a fortnight since global attention began fixating on flu. There have been over 4,379 cases worldwide and more than 280 in Canada. We are likely past the midpoint of this episode and it's not the "big one." We learned lessons from SARS that we applied to this flu outbreak. This time, how have we done and what have we learned?</p>
<p>I would give Canadian public health authorities an A grade. We learned from SARS that leadership matters. Dr. David Butler-Jones, Chief Public Health Officer of Canada -- a post created post-SARS -- has been a trusted, reassuring voice. He has emphasized simple, effective measures -- wash your hands, cough and sneeze into a tissue or sleeve, stay at home if you are sick. There has also been better co-operation between federal and provincial/territorial health authorities.</p>
<p>Canadian scientists sequenced the genome of the virus and showed that it was the same in Canada as in Mexico. They deserve praise for helping Mexican public health authorities test virus samples. We have anti-viral stockpiles of 55 million doses, and have started to develop a vaccine.</p>
<p>Canadian authorities could have better explained why they warned against travel to Mexico. While this seemed reasonable, it went against the advice of the World Health Organization and our own remonstrations when we were at the receiving end of a travel advisory during SARS. Also, some have argued the Canadian response was slow off the mark.</p>
<p>I would give the global response a B grade. The human flu emergency turned into a mini Mad Cow-type crisis. Calling it "swine flu" initially skewered the international pork trade, even though public health authorities emphasized that you can't catch flu from eating pork chops. In Egypt, authorities slaughtered pigs owned</p>
<p>by a poor Christian minority group, fanning religious conflict. Afghanistan's only known pig--in the Kabul zoo -- has been quarantined. The casual musings of a World Health Organization official, and the outbreak in Alberta pigs, didn't help.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization response was robust, but its pandemic scale sends the wrong signal to the public. It can reach its top level in a mild pandemic so it appears to foretell doomsday even if people around the world have only the sniffles. Meanwhile, some countries reacted to criticisms of their actions during SARS with questionable quarantines, such as with the group of healthy Quebec students quarantined in China.</p>
<p>Mexico was remarkably transparent once the epidemic was underway. There was some finger-pointing about the delay from first notification by Mexican authorities to action by the World Health Organization, but identifying a novel virus is like finding a needle in the haystack of seasonal influenza. Like Canada after SARS, Mexico will want to evaluate its response.</p>
<p>Did we cry wolf ? No. The flu virus is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Flu, a cunning adversary, can mutate to be more transmissible, lethal and drug resistant. Some have argued the media is drawing attention away from other public health priorities; in fact the flu is probably drawing attention away from Paris Hilton. It is a sad coincidence, though, that while a million people died in the 1957 and 1968 flu pandemics, the same number, mostly children under five in Africa, die each year from malaria.</p>
<p>What is next? This flu episode will probably end like some TV shows: "to be continued." We'll be tuning into the flu season just starting in the southern hemisphere and our flu season here next fall.</p>
<p>The threat of flu is constant. It's like the threat of terrorism. The virus needs to break through only once; we need to stop it every time. But this epidemic of H1N1 has left us better prepared for future pandemics.</p>
<p>In Canada, we should remain vigilant and prepared, and be ready with a vaccine in case the flu re-emerges with a vengeance in the fall, as it did in 1918 when more than 50 million died.</p>
<p>In a severe pandemic, most sickness and death will be in the developing world. Unfortunately, the globalization of disease threats is greater than the globalization of health defences. Mexico's anti-viral stockpile at the beginning of the epidemic was only one million doses for 110 million people, and there are concerns about future availability of flu vaccine in the developing world. Canada should help because we are compassionate and capable, and because, as this epidemic shows, we are all in this together in an interconnected world.</p>

<p>Meet Barack Obama, stand-up comic.</p>
<p>For a few short hours Saturday night, the U.S. president put aside concerns about a global swine flu outbreak and the stability of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal for a turn as joke teller-in-chief at the White House Correspondents Association dinner in Washington.</p>
<p>And no one was spared.</p>
<p>Playing to a crowd that ranged from reporters in rented tuxedos to celebrity A-listers such as Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise, Obama skewered former presidential rival Hillary Clinton, poked fun at beleaguered U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and inspired groans with a torture joke about a certain former vice-president.</p>
<p>He even cracked wise about his reputation for having an oversized-ego.</p>
<p>"Good evening, everybody, I would like to welcome you to the 10-day anniversary of my First 100 Days," Obama told a crowd of 2,500 at the Washington Hilton.</p>
<p>"During the second 100 days, we will design, build and open a library dedicated to my first 100 days. My next 100 days will be so successful, I will complete them in 72 days. And on the 73rd day, I will rest."</p>
<p>Quipping about his oft-criticized use of teleprompters, and his vice-president's reputation for loose lips, Obama said: "In the next hundred days, I will learn to go off prompter -- and Joe Biden will learn to stay on it."</p>
<p>It was Obama's debut performance at the biggest event on Washington's social calendar, a $200-a-ticket affair that has become known as Hollywood on the Potomac for the number of high-wattage stars it draws to the typically-staid U.S. capital.</p>
<p>With Republican George W. Bush back in Texas, however, there was a marked jump in the number of entertainment industry liberals at the event.</p>
<p>Referring to the long and frequently bitter Democratic presidential primary in 2008, Obama assured the audience that Clinton had put aside her presidential ambitions to help him solve international crises like the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"We had been rivals during the campaign, but these days we could not be closer," he said of his secretary of state. "In fact, the second she got back from Mexico, she pulled me into a hug and gave me a big kiss. Told me to get down there myself."</p>
<p>The U.S. president steered clear of jokes about the sensitive issue of water boarding terror suspects. Well, almost.</p>
<p>"Dick Cheney was supposed to be here, but he is very busy working on his memoir, tentatively titled, 'How</p>
<p>to shoot friends and interrogate people,' " he said.</p>
<p>At other times, Obama ventured into more sensitive areas with his humour.</p>
<p>Only a day after a White House aide resigned for approving a low-altitude Air Force One flyover of lower Manhattan, Obama pushed the envelope with a joke about a recent incident that terrified many New Yorkers.</p>
<p>"Sasha and Malia aren't here tonight, because they're grounded," he said. "You can't just take Air Force One on a joyride to Manhattan. I don't care whose kids you are."</p>

<p>REGINA -- Saskatchewan's Ministry of Health has confirmed two more cases of H1N1 flu, bringing the total in the province to four.</p>
<p>The two new cases were diagnosed in school-age youths in the Heartland and Prince Albert Parkland health regions. Two earlier cases involved a teenage girl from Saskatoon and a woman in her 20s in Regina, both of whom vacationed in Mexico last month.</p>
<p>The latest cases involved two boys who began showing mild symptoms of the flu in early May and were tested for the H1N1 virus. The positive test results came back on Saturday confirming they had been infected with this particular flu virus. Both boys are said to be recovering.</p>
<p>"They weren't in Mexico. So it is sort of reaffirming our view that this is another flu strain that is circulating in the community and it is behaving similar to seasonal flu in terms of its severity," a spokesperson for the ministry said.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan residents are reminded the best way to reduce the spread of influenza is to practise good habits like frequent handwashing, and coughing and sneezing into the elbow rather than hands.</p>
<p>Anyone with mild flu symptoms is asked to stay home and to contact their doctor or the HealthLine at 1-877-800-0002 if their symptoms worsen within the first 24 hours of the onset of symptoms.</p>

<p>As 28 more Canadians tested positive for swine flu yesterday, four Japanese returning from Ontario became the first confirmed cases of the virus in Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese authorities quarantined a 46-year-old male teacher and three teenage students, who had been on a school trip. The teacher and students had stayed in Oakville, west of Toronto, from April 24 until last Thursday.</p>
<p>The teacher was being given Tamiflu while the students were recovering, officials said.</p>
<p>Forty-nine others who were aboard their flight on Friday from Detroit to Tokyo were also quarantined.</p>
<p>The national total in Canada is 281 infections: 79 in B.C., 76 in Ontario, 56 in Nova Scotia, 46 in Alberta, 16 in Quebec, three in P.E.I., two each in Saskatchewan and New Brunswick, and one in Manitoba.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the World Health Organization had confirmed 3,440 cases worldwide in 29 countries, with Argentina, Australia, Japan and Panama all reporting their first confirmed cases. One death has been confirmed in Canada - in Alberta - 48 in Mexico, two in the United States and one in Costa Rica.</p>

<p>Quebec confirmed a new case of swine flu yesterday - a third student at Collège Charlemagne in Pierrefonds.</p>
<p>The total number of infected people in the province stands at 16. All cases are considered mild.</p>
<p>A Grade 3 student at Collège Charlemagne had contracted the H1N1 virus while vacationing in Mexico. Now, two of his classmates have been infected.</p>
<p>Charlemagne students were exposed before the first case had been confirmed, and health authorities continue to say the school should remain open.</p>
<p>"Based on what we know about the virus, it's not a good idea to close schools," Alain Poirier, director of Quebec's public health agency, told a news conference yesterday.</p>
<p>The virus is being transmitted in the community, so there is no guarantee that other infections will not occur, Poirier said.</p>
<p>"We are the reservoir of the virus. It's in our mouths and in our noses," he said.</p>
<p>Health authorities recommend good hygiene etiquette, such as washing hands often.</p>

<p>Re: "This Mother's Day someone will be missing" (Gazette, May 8).</p>
<p>I read Mike Boone's moving comments about his first Mother's Day without his mom. Which one of us who is motherless could not relate? I, too, remember my first Mother's Day, feeling lost while everyone I knew had their day all planned out. This day is difficult for me still.</p>
<p>Boone's candid and moving testimonial of his love for his mother made me cry.  How nice to see lovely emotions expressed in the morning paper instead of more tales of woe, financial problems and H1N1. And by the way, Mike, it is now 18 motherless Mother's Days for me, and every one of them is spent missing her, wishing she were here, and begins with me kissing the picture of her beautiful face. Now go kiss your picture of her again!</p>

<p>Canadian health authorities need to take a second look at what improvements are required before another, more virulent strain of influenza surfaces.</p>
<p>With a population of 33 million, 101 cases of H1N1 have been reported in Canada. Meanwhile, the most recent statistics show 218 cases in the United States, with a population nine times greater than Canada's.</p>
<p>One has to wonder if Canadian health authorities should have done more to limit tourist travel with Mexico considering that Mexicans are being advised to skip work and stay at home as much as possible by their own health officials.</p>

</div><div>Ben Gelinas and Jennifer Fong   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal; With files from Canwest News Service and Bill Mah</div>
<div>822 words</div><div>10 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>A hog farmer near Rocky Mountain House isn't sick, but says he's become a victim of the H1N1 virus just the same.</p>
<p>"We came to Alberta in 2003 from Holland with the dream of building a farm where we could raise our family," Arnold Van Ginkel said in a statement on Saturday.</p>
<p>From 220 sows, the family raised a herd of about 2,500 pigs, he said.</p>
<p>"Two weeks ago, our dream turned into a nightmare after it was found out that our hogs were exposed to the H1N1 virus."</p>
<p>Van Ginkel said he reported the disease immediately and fully co-operated with the government.</p>
<p>"We have quarantined our barn to make sure that the virus would not have a chance to spread to other farms or to people. Our first priority has been to protect our family, our neighbours and our industry."</p>
<p>Van Ginkel said his family, including his six children, have been tested and are safe.</p>
<p>"This has been a very difficult time for our family, and we will continue to work with the government to get through this."</p>
<p>He appealed for privacy for his family and community.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Alberta's chief veterinarian said 500 pigs in Van Ginkel's herd were killed, not because of the disease, but to prevent overcrowding at the farm where they have been quarantined since April 28.</p>
<p>"It was something that we had to do," said Gerald Hauer. "Pigs continue to grow and to be ready for market. Due to the quarantine, these animals cannot be moved off the farm as they normally would. As such, we had more animals than was ideal for the space that was available."</p>
<p>The decision was made after discussions between Van Ginkel, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and federal and provincial animal health officials.</p>
<p>The culled pigs won't enter the food chain, but will be disposed of safely, Hauer said.</p>
<p>Van Ginkel will be compensated for the lost pigs, not all of which were sick.</p>
<p>The quarantine will be lifted after veterinarians have determined the virus has run its course. It is believed the pigs caught the virus from a sick carpenter working in the barn.</p>
<p>About 450 pigs became ill. None died from the virus, according to a CFIA report.</p>
<p>No vaccination or treatment was administered to the pigs.</p>
<p>"Because influenza is caused by a virus, there are no medications that you can give to a pig to clear it of the virus," said Hauer.</p>
<p>The pork industry has been hit hard by the flu scare, said Alberta Pork chairman Herman Simons.</p>
<p>"Economically, we've been trying to get out of a hole," Simons said. "Just at the time when you start to see a little bit of light at the tunnel, and being focused forward, it seems like we're being caught by the train from the rear end."</p>
<p>Before the flu hit, hogs were worth about $135 each, Simons said, but pork prices have since dropped by about $15 to $20. "You're talking about millions a week all over North America."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, four new cases of H1N1 were confirmed in Alberta on Saturday; two women from Edmonton and a boy and girl from Calgary were suffering mild symptoms.</p>
<p>They were among 39 more Canadians who tested positive for H1N1 on Saturday, bringing the national total to 281 infections: 79 in B.C., 76 in Ontario, 56 in Nova Scotia, 46 in Alberta, 16 in Quebec, three in P.E.I., two each in Saskatchewan and New Brunswick, and one in Manitoba.</p>
<p>Three Japanese citizens returning from Ontario became the first confirmed cases of the virus in Japan.</p>
<p>Of the 46 cases reported in Alberta, 13 are from the Edmonton area, 17 are from Calgary, nine are from central Alberta and seven are from northern Alberta.</p>
<p>Alberta Health and Wellness expects more confirmed cases in Canada that have no obvious links to Mexico.</p>
<p>Of the 46 confirmed cases in Alberta, seven patients have no history of recent travel, and seven more lack a confirmed link to another country.</p>
<p>"We have more person-to-person transmission locally," Health and Wellness spokesman Howard May said Saturday. "Given that there are thousands of cases in countries all over the world, travel history to Mexico is really becoming less important in monitoring the progression."</p>
<p>Officials say it will likely be at least a week before they get a definitive answer as to whether or not the strain contributed to the death of Tina L'Hirondelle, a 39-year-old Gift Lake woman who was found to have been suffering from the illness, along with other medical issues.</p>

<p>The nanny state continues to flourish in Britain, but don't make the mistake of thinking the clowns are taking over -- because a circus clown in Liverpool has been prohibited from wearing his big, floppy shoes.</p>
<p>Valerik Kashkin was performing in the legendary English port city with the Moscow State Circus when he fell from a three-metre high wire, hurting his left foot. Kashkin went to hospital where he learned he fractured his metatarsal -- and if you don't know what that is, then obviously you weren't paying attention in biology class.</p>
<p>British health and safety advisers were not impressed with Kashkin's workplace mishap and banned him from wearing his size 18 shoes again on British soil, reports ananova.com.</p>
<p>"The shoes are an important part of my costume," said the 40-year-old bozo.</p>
<p>Said his boss, Paul Archer: "We live in a litigation world and I guess we just have to follow through these procedures. It's a real balancing act."</p>
<p>Balancing act, get it? What a clown.</p>
<p>Tears of a psycho</p>
<p>"Clowns aren't funny. In fact, they're kind of scary. I've wondered where this started and I think it goes back to the time I went to the circus, and a clown killed my dad."</p>
<p>-- Jack Handy</p>
<p>Don't scare the kids</p>
<p>Anyone who has had experience with globetrotting Britons can tell you how insufferably arrogant some of them can be. But now there is more than just anecdotal evidence to back up that assertion.</p>
<p>In a story brought our attention by sagacious reader Caroline Knowles, the A&A Economic Digest outlines some of the more bizarre complaints heard from British holidaymakers:</p>
<p>- The sand is too white;</p>
<p>- There are too many Spanish people in Spain;</p>
<p>- Too much curry is being served in Indian restaurants;</p>
<p>- It takes nine hours to fly back to the U.K. from Jamaica, while it takes only three hours for Americans to get home; and finally, from BBC Radio 4 ...</p>
<p>- Nobody told us there would be fish in the sea. The children were startled.</p>
<p>Don't cross Tinky Winky</p>
<p>Speaking of British holidaymakers, police were called to break up a drunken brawl at a holiday camp in the English coastal town of Dawlish.</p>
<p>Among the brawlers: Tinky Winky the Teletubby, Spiderman and an Oompa-Loompa from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.</p>
<p>As many as 20 inebriated vacationers were involved in the clash, and 10 of them were arrested, reports the Daily Mail. Tinky Winky, Spiderman and the Oompa-Loompa were held in jail overnight for questioning.</p>

<p>Republic over a story that comes as no surprise Irish for a day</p>
<p>A local lad in Sheffield, England, spent three days on life support after undergoing an emergency brain operation. Then he awoke, sat up in his hospital bed, and served up a "stirring rendition" of Danny Boy in a perfect Irish accent.</p>
<p>The thing is, Chris Gregory isn't Irish. In fact, he has never been to Ireland, nor does he have any Irish relatives. In fact, the born-and-bred Yorkshireman has no connection to Ireland at all.</p>
<p>The singing "sounded like a drunken Irishman," said Gregory's wife, Mary. "Chris was sitting up in bed belting out the tune with all the right words and the thick Irish accent like he'd grown up in Dublin."</p>
<p>Moreover, when he caught his first glimpse of Mary, Chris beamed from ear to ear and giggled, "It's da broid ... ."</p>
<p>According to the Yorkshire Post, the 30-year-old gardener continued to speak with a Gaelic lilt for half-an-hour before it disappeared.</p>

<p>Surely this is a sign of the apocalypse.</p>
<p>Theatre producers in Los Angeles are busily preparing to stage</p>
<p>Octo-Mom, The Musical.</p>
<p>According to Doug Camilli in the Montreal Gazette, auditions are now underway. Opening night is June 20. The producers promise a "fast-paced musical pastiche ripped from the headlines," and an "epic for our strange times."</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Subversive exercises</p>
<p>Some folks might consider the latest news coming out of Tasmania to be a tad strange, too. That's where a Baptist pastor has just punted a tai chi class from his church because the exercises "go against the Bible."</p>
<p>Look, we don't make this stuff up.</p>
<p>Seniors have been attending classes for the martial arts-based calisthenics at Wynyard Baptist Church for the better part of two years, reports the <span class="companylink">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</span>. Some say the workouts help relieve their arthritis.</p>
<p>"It's just given me mobility," said Wendy Broomhall. "My arthritis is crippling."</p>
<p>But the Rev. Viv Morse says he thought the seniors were doing simple exercises, not tai chi. Parishioners were concerned because of the martial art's links to, gasp, Buddhism.</p>
<p>"We have a right to say that is not acceptable in our church because it clashes with our Christian beliefs," said the vicar.</p>
<p>The decision, he added, is final.</p>
<p>Alert John Connor</p>
<p>In what sounds like a scene from an Isaac Asimov novel, a factory worker in Balsta, Sweden, was doing maintenance work on a defective robot when it suddenly came to life and attacked him.</p>
<p>According to the Portland Oregonian, the robot grabbed a hold of the man's head. He's lucky it didn't kill him, but the repairman did suffer four broken ribs before he managed to free himself.</p>

<p>Speaking of science fiction, last week's Telescope laundry list of capsule movie reviews so tickled perspicacious reader Ed Boulay that he crafted another:</p>
<p>- "2001: A Space Odyssey: All HAL breaks loose on the way to Jupiter."</p>
<p>Ham-fisted response</p>
<p>From Telescope's foreign desk comes news that the only pig in Afghanistan has been put in quarantine because of concerns it might infect the populace with swine flu.</p>
<p>According to London's Daily Telegraph, the pig is a curiosity in the Islamic country, where pork and other pig products are illegal because they are considered irreligious.</p>
<p>The pig is being kept at the Kabul zoo.</p>

<p>Claire Helmers boldly proclaims that "evolution is a lie."</p>
<p>Let us examine the creationist view of the swine flu pandemic. The swine flu virus is not the result of genetic evolution of previous influenza strains; rather, it has been in its current form since God created it (and everything else) 4,300 years ago. As to why it waited until now to finally start infecting pigs and humans, I am not sure; I will seek the answer from next Sunday's sermon.</p>
<p>Evolution is absolutely true as a scientific theory. It is no coincidence that a secular, scientifically educated nation like Canada was the first to crack the genetic code on this evolved strain of flu virus, while nations that still embrace creationist myths can only stand by and wait for the developed world to send them aid and vaccines. Helmers should think about that when she goes for next season's flu shot.</p>

<p>I hate pigs. I grew up on a central Alberta mixed farm where we raised grains, cattle and a large herd of those dastardly porcine beasts. I took a natural dislike to them as a young child and, growing into my chore years, would rather do two hours in the cow barn than 30 minutes in the pig barn.</p>
<p>Why? Because the little beggars are smart. And hungry. They'd be just as happy to eat their feeder's boots or overalls as the food they're being given. They're aggressive and noisy and smelly, and you can't tell one from another. They don't listen to logic and they're pretty good at knocking you over. We don't call them swine for nothing.</p>
<p>But I love pork. Ribs, hams, braised shoulders, grilled chops, barbecued loins. And bacon, yeah, bacon. In fact, I have considered it my lifelong purpose to eat as much pork as possible--it's my personal vendetta against the porky mob. One less of them, one more for me.</p>
<p>So I'm disappointed that some of my pork-eating cohorts have lessened their consumption recently due to the H1N1 flu problem. There's no reason to. Unless that pig is alive and snuffling more than usual, there's no problem. According to the World Health Organization, we can't get the flu by eating properly handled meat. And our own agencies are working diligently to exclude any ill hogs from the market.</p>
<p>So I'm calling on all Albertans to support our hog producers just like we supported the cattle ranchers in the days of BSE. It's time to bring pork back onto your fork, and I'd like to suggest a few places to get a good pig-feed.</p>
<p>Gaucho (3605 Manchester Rd. S. E., 403-454-9119): Pork loin and ribs skewered and rotisserie barbecued in the Brazilian churrasco tradition is what you'll find at Gaucho, along with other meaty treats and fine Brazilian dishes. That is, if you can find Gaucho itself, hidden among the body shops of Manchester Road.</p>
<p>Il Gallo Nero (211 17th Ave. S. E., 403-237-9077): Pizzas topped with prosciutto or pancetta; pork tenderloin crusted with pumpkin seeds and served with gnocchi in a Gorgonzola and dried-cherry sauce; ravioli stuffed with double-smoked bacon; and antipasto packed with porky goodness. They're all at Il Gallo Nero.</p>
<p>Le La (6624 Centre St. S., 403-255-5665): Vietnamese salad rolls are stuffed with grilled pork at Le La, a new restaurant along Centre Street South. That pork also shows up in soups and atop vermicelli noodle and rice dishes.</p>
<p>LeVilla (1851 Sirocco Dr. S. W., 403-217-9699): LeVilla's chef-owner Rick Chuk crusts pork chops with panko and serves them in a Madeira-double-smoked-bacon-chipotle sauce. He also loads up his Stilton salad with walnuts and more of that smokey bacon.</p>
<p>Leo Fu's (511 70th Ave. S. W., 403-255-2528): Try the ginger pork --as good as the ginger beef--at Leo Fu's. Or the shredded mooshu pork, or the sweet and sour pork, or the great grilled dumplings at this Calgary landmark of Mandarin and Szechwan cuisine.</p>
<p>The Palomino (109 7th Ave. S. W., 403-532-1911): If there's no pork, there's no barbecue. Apple-wood-smoked pulled pork and Kansas City ribs are the two big pork dishes at The Palomino, a funky Southern smokehouse downtown.</p>
<p>ParkerHouse (131 6th Ave. S. W., 403-237-9585): In the stylish new ParkerHouse, chef Andrew Keen cures his own ham and serves it with lentils and offers one of the few pork-and-beans dishes in the city.</p>
<p>Rush (207 9th Ave. S. W., 403-271-7874): Rush has joined the wealth of new places making their own charcuterie by drying house-made sausages and cold cuts. They also serve top-grade milk-fed pork from Quebec.</p>
<p>Shikiji (1608 Centre St. N., 403-520-0093): Many Japanese noodle soups are made with pork broth and are topped with grilled pork. Some of the finest, and most elegantly served, Japanese pork dishes are at Shikiji, an understated restaurant on Centre Street North.</p>
<p>Spolumbo's (1308 9th Ave. S. E., 403-264-6452): More Italian-style porcine goodness is at Spolumbo's-- all the cured meats plus a selection of lovely, pork-based Italian sausages. And why not? It was the Romans who developed the salt-curing process they called "perexsuctum,"meaning "to thoroughly dry."</p>
<p>Sura (2320 4th St. N. W., 403-569-1454): This new, family-run Korean restaurant douses pork with rich spices and pungent sauces to create bulgogi, and then serves it with an array of kimchee, pickles, and other side dishes.</p>
<p>In Alberta, we bring almost three million hogs to market each year. Given that there are many who do not eat pork for various reasons, that means there's at least one pig for each Albertan. It's time to pig out.</p>

</p>
<p>Yuck!</p>
<p>Researchers say the emotion that triggers this kind of verbal response is hard-wired in human brains to help avoid disease.</p>
<p>"The feelings we have about nasty stuff that might make us sick is disgust," says Dr. Val Curtis, one of the world's leading experts in hygiene behaviour.</p>
<p>"It turns out that we actually recognize different types of disease threats and have slightly different disgust systems within the brain that respond to those threats," says Curtis, director of the Hygiene Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</p>
<p>In short, hygiene is in our genes.</p>
<p>"It's the voices of our ancestors in our heads saying, 'Don't touch. Don't eat sh** because you'll die. And your kids will die. And you won't procreate.'"</p>
<p>But if we're born to be clean, why aren't more people doing that most basic thing - handwashing - to protect themselves and each other?</p>
<p>A gram of human feces "contains more viruses and bacteria than there are people on the planet," Curtis says. Yet only 43 per cent of moms in the United Kingdom washed their hands after changing a dirty diaper, a Hygiene Centre study found.</p>
<p>Just as dismal is a report from Ontario's auditor general noting just 28 per cent of doctors at 10 hospitals washed their hands between patients.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>"I posed the same question to a set of doctors," Curtis says. "They said, 'Well, we wash after a patient.' I said ... After a patient? Shouldn't it be before a patient?'</p>
<p>"They sort of stopped to think and said, 'Oh, yeah.'"</p>
<p>In Britain, Curtis says, evidence shows hospital workers generally do wash their hands but it's typically after contact with things that are disgusting - a bedpan or heavily soiled sheets or wound dressings.</p>
<p>Studies show there are three types of handwashing: habitual, motivated and planned.</p>
<p>Habitual handwashing is the kind we do without thinking about it, washing before dinner or after using a public toilet. Motivated handwashing is what you do after you come in contact with something you feel is disgusting.</p>
<p>Planned handwashing, which public health officials are asking people to do, is a response to education and knowledge about disease.</p>
<p>But it's not enough to teach people about germs, Curtis says.</p>
<p>"You've got to creep them out."</p>
<p>The British government launched an aggressive hygiene campaign on TV last week, showing someone walking into an elevator, sneezing, and spreading the germs around.</p>
<p>"The U.K. government is interested in using the whole idea of disgust to get the message across that nasty, filthy surfaces that people have sneezed on and dirty hands - things like that - are disgusting," Curtis says. "That's actually a very powerful way of motivating behaviour change."</p>
<p>This month, the Canadian government launched its own campaign around influenza and the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"Knowledge is the best defence and we want to keep Canadians continually informed with useful and timely information concerning influenza," Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, said in a statement.</p>
<p>When Curtis heard the results of the Star's survey - that people washed more thoroughly in clean restrooms - she was not surprised.</p>
<p>"All the qualitative interviewing we've done says people hate dirty bathrooms," she says. "In a dirty bathroom, they get out quick as they can."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Timely, scary simulation of scientific detective work -</b>
</div><div>By John Sullivan   </div>
<div>654 words</div><div>10 May 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>D7</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>As the world falls all over itself to respond to a threatened H1N1-flu pandemic, Ross Pennie's Tainted (ECW Press, 240 pages, $25) is a timely, fascinating and scary simulation of the scientific detective work involved in an outbreak investigation.</p>
<p>Zol Szabo, associate chief medical officer of health for Hamilton-Lakeshore region, knows the three-case cluster of rapid-onset Creutzfeldt-Jakob (mad cow) disease that drops in his lap one bleak November night could be both a health nightmare and a career-ender.</p>
<p>Szabo and his small team (including a comely P.I.) scramble to find the disease source that links the deaths of a rich philanthropist's wife, a car salesman and a dentist. But, as the caseload jumps to seven, the genie is soon out of the bottle and all public hell breaks loose.</p>
<p>Fearing that his young son may be infected but hampered by medical politicians, a grandstanding "star" investigator's rush to (false) judgment, and a flurry of finger-pointing, Szabo frantically sifts a whatdunit haystack of possible contaminants from Swiss chocolate to British sausages to a new botox drug.</p>
<p>Eventually there's murder too, but this resonant (if somewhat plodding) first novel stoutly eschews the potboiler epidemic of gratuitous sex, wild derring-do and cinematic hyperbole for stark realism.</p>
<p>Pennie, an infectious-disease specialist at Hamilton's McMaster University, knows of what he speaks. And he makes clear that the scariest aspect of any new plague will almost certainly be the swirl of public, media and official panic that dogs and impedes efforts to cope with it.</p>
<p>"ô "ô "ô</p>
<p>The movie scripts in novel clothing now cluttering the bestseller lists are getting a bit much. Accessorize with an overworked wiseguy amateur-sleuth motif, and it's downright irritating.</p>
<p>Blame Indiana Jones, and guys like New Jerseyite Harlen Coben, whose sports-agent adventurer, Myron Bolitar, cracks wise throughout a ninth outing in Long Lost (Dutton, 384 pages, $35), a few-reels-missing broth of mad terrorists, covert U.S. torturers, and Mossad/Interpol intrigue.</p>
<p>Hey, why not kick in SMERSH, the Man from UNCLE and Max Smart, and field a baseball team?</p>
<p>The plot, such as it is, revolves around an old flame, her dead ex's journalistic probe of a terrorist cell and evidence that their long-dead daughter is still alive. A lot of bodies, banter and (reader-included) bafflement ensues. Add your own "b" for further enlightenment.</p>
<p>And still more: think beach, blockbuster and brain cells (as in few needed to enjoy).</p>
<p>"ô "ô "ô</p>
<p>There's something about Scandinavian angst that puts all other anxieties in the shade.</p>
<p>The Redeemer, (Random House, 458 pages, $28), Jo Nesbo's latest Harry Hole mystery to receive English translation, is layered with so much Norwegian guilt, deceit, greed and revenge lust that -- well, you need more deadly sins.</p>
<p>What do you say about a book whose most sympathetic protagonist, other than headstrong and troubled Det. Hole, is the bloodless Croatian assassin intent on killing an Oslo Salvation Army officer for no discernable reason? Brilliant, for starters.</p>
<p>Dubbed the "little redeemer," the Balkan hit-man with a shape-shifting face realizes he's killed the wrong Bible-thumper at a Christmas street concert and goes after the real target -- apparently, his brother.</p>
<p>With no weapon, evidence or motive, Hole's team manages to trace a web of murder, rape and sins-of-the-saintly corruption, strand by strand.</p>
<p>Nesbo is a master of grimly fascinating, multi-layered intrigue, set in an unfamiliar but evocative city that is surgically drawn. The ending will simply blindside you, as will the redemptive power of his storytelling.</p>
<p>Bet your last kroner -- one of the year's best.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Japanese cases linked to Ontario as Canada confirms 281 infected</b>
</div><div>Vanessa Lu   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>401 words</div><div>10 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>MET</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>As the H1N1 flu virus spreads around the world, health authorities are trying to determine whether there is a link to Ontario.</p>
<p>Provincial authorities are looking at three possible cases involving a high school teacher and two teenage students who returned to Japan after taking part in a school exchange that visited Oakville, according to the CBC.</p>
<p>"We just have scant information," said ministry spokesperson David Jensen told the Star's Vanessa Lu yesterday. "It is suspected they have the virus. We're trying to determine if they have it and how they got it."</p>
<p>Several new cases of swine flu, including 19 in British Columbia, were reported yesterday in Canada bringing the nation's total to 281. In Ontario, 14 cases were confirmed yesterday, most in Greater Toronto, bringing the total to 76.</p>
<p>In Halton region, medical officer of health Dr. Bob Nosal announced three new cases, for a total of five. Two of the cases are students - including one who attends the same school where a previous case was confirmed. The possibility of a link is being investigated.</p>
<p>The third case involved a young adult in a different community.</p>
<p>"I want to emphasize that influenza is transmitted primarily in the community. It is not at all surprising that there could be a second case in a school," Nosal said, adding there is no need for school closures at this time.</p>
<p>In other developments:</p>
<p>Alberta announced its first death linked to swine flu. Doctors say the 39-year-old woman who died April 28 had not travelled to Mexico but had chronic health conditions. Some 500 hogs have been culled on a pig farm in central Alberta where the herd was found to be infected with the new swine flu virus. The entire herd of 1,700 pigs remains under quarantine.</p>
<p>The U.S. reported a Washington state man was the third person infected to die in the U.S.</p>
<p>Costa Rica reported a 53-year-old man died of swine flu yesterday, the first fatality from the epidemic outside of North America.</p>
<p>Australia reported its first case yesterday in a woman who it said was no longer infectious.</p>
<p>Norway confirmed its first two cases: a man and a woman, both 20, who had studied in Mexico.</p>

</p>
<p>The pattern is random yet also logical. Cases of H1N1 flu reflect, mostly, where recent travellers to Mexico live, but also population density - where more people live, more travel. So the very limited number of cases - so far - show some in Northern Ontario but more in population centres, including the largest number in Greater Toronto.</p>

<p>You don't have to tell Paul Nyhof how valuable the Provincial Health Contact Centre is.</p>
<p>Before becoming the centre's director, Nyhof was a satisfied customer.</p>
<p>About seven years ago, he was at home with his 18-month-old daughter, who was running a high fever late at night.</p>
<p>Nyhof called the centre's Health Links-Info Santé phone number and was put through to a nurse, who advised him how to treat the fever.</p>
<p>"That reassurance, that value -- I think my wife was away as well -- just really helped me to manage the situation in the home without having to go to the doctor or the emergency room," Nyhof recalled.</p>
<p>That simple, effective link to assistance is one of the reasons Winnipeg's Provincial Health Contact Centre is an award-winning, internationally recognized service.</p>
<p>Started in 1994 out of Misericordia Health Centre as Health Links-Info Santé, the bilingual program was the first telephone-, nurse-based triage system in Canada.</p>
<p>It began with one nurse answering calls part time from members of the community living around the centre. She gave them health information and advice, such as whether they should go to an emergency room, see a family doctor or treat their symptoms at home.</p>
<p>That first year she received 1,000 to 2,000 calls and she urged her superiors to expand the program.</p>
<p>They did -- in a big way.</p>
<p>The program became the Provincial Health Contact Centre (PHCC) in 2003, and now has 30 health and non-clinical inbound and outbound programs funded by the Manitoba government and Winnipeg Regional Health Authority.</p>
<p>The centre handled 550,000 calls from across the province last year. Totals for this year should spike because Health Links-Info Santé is the number to dial for information about the H1N1 flu virus (204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257).</p>
<p>"We've played a role in all kinds of public health issues, from SARS to menococcal (meningitis) to West Nile virus to clean beaches," Nyhof said.</p>
<p>He estimated Health Links-Info Santé was receiving 30 to 100 calls a day about the H1N1 flu virus soon after the connection began April 30.</p>
<p>"Someone might be calling about a pediatric cough unrelated to H1N1, but they're concerned about some of the media stuff that's going on around that," he said.</p>
<p>"At the start, a lot of this is just allaying fears. We had a lot of questions around the travel bans, a lot of questions around the ability to eat pork."</p>
<p>When a call comes into Health Links-Info Santé, registered nurses get information about symptoms and follow clinical protocols on their computer screens to decide what action should be taken.</p>
<p>A staff of 80 full- and part-time nurses answers calls 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Interpreters for more than 110 languages are available.</p>
<p>In 2008, the centre received a VIP award from McKesson Technology Solutions, a Fortune 500 company, for its use of information technology to achieve outstanding results in the delivery of health care to its community.</p>
<p>Some of the centre's other health-related programs include a breastfeeding hotline and a unique, award-winning heart failure program.</p>
<p>The heart program, started in 2006 with a grant and linking the centre with University of Manitoba researchers, involves people living in the community with congestive heart failure.</p>
<p>Specially trained nurses help put together individualized programs for about 200 registered clients. The nurses regularly call clients to monitor their blood pressure and weight and provide educational information. Doctors and other community resources may also be involved.</p>
<p>The program, the first of its kind in Canada, won a Delivery System Design Award at the 2007 Global Perspectives on Chronic Diseases Prevention and Management conference.</p>
<p>The centre recently obtained a grant from Canada Health Infoway and Manitoba Health to expand the program to more rural and remote regions, as well as include diabetes and work with aboriginal populations, Nyhof said.</p>
<p>In remote locations where access to a phone is difficult, the system will use video conferencing, possibly at nursing stations and clinics, he added.</p>
<p>In the big picture, the program plays an important role in taking pressure off the health-care system by reducing visits to emergency rooms and specialists, he said.</p>
<p>The centre's non-clinical programs relate to services such as Manitoba Home Care, Family Services and Housing and Employment and Income Assistance.</p>
<p>Those calls, often after-hours, include people seeking everything from food to transportation.</p>
<p>"The (PHCC) has grown from such a small program to becoming an integral part of the health system in Manitoba," Nyhof said.</p>
<p>"Now, with this move into chronic disease and some of the expansions we've had in that area, it's allowed us to proactively manage, reactively manage and really support the health-care system in times like this when we're faced with a pandemic.</p>
<p>"It's really at the forefront of health-care delivery in Manitoba."</p>
<p>The Provincial Health Contact Centre operates 30 inbound and outbound telephone programs related to health and social services.</p>
<p>The award-winning service by the numbers:</p>
<p>The centre answered 550,000 calls last year.</p>
<p>More than 186,000 calls were made to the bilingual Health Links-Info Santé program, which operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.</p>
<p>About 80 full- and part-time registered nurses answer calls at Health Links-Info Santé, which has access to interpreters for more than 110 different languages.</p>
<p>Almost 203,000 calls came in to the after-hours central intake program last year.</p>
<p>There were 760 calls made last year related to the centre's heart failure and chronic disease management program.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Bargains at sea beckon; Deep discounts sometimes come with pitfalls</b>
</div><div>Jane Engle   </div>
<div>McClatchy Tribune News Service</div>
<div>823 words</div><div>10 May 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>C7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>If you're ready to hit the high seas with the family this summer, you'll find some bargains bobbing on the waves -- and a few rocks beneath.</p>
<p>This is no time to throw away the compass.</p>
<p>Sure, you can find fares under $100 US a day, double occupancy, or even less for a third or fourth passenger sharing a cabin, as cruise lines try to tempt recession-shocked North Americans aboard.</p>
<p>Delve deeper into the math, and you hit a problem.</p>
<p>"Do you want to stay in a 180-square-foot cabin with four people?" asked Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor-in-chief of CruiseCritic.com, a consumer information website. "It's a really, really tight space."</p>
<p>Scarce inventory on last-minute discounts can wreak havoc, too. "Don't get so excited if the fare is $249 and you find out you have to book cabins in two separate parts of the ship," Spencer Brown said.</p>
<p>Fortunately, on many newer ships you'll find connecting cabins or, even better, oversized family cabins that can cost less than two regular cabins. You just have to look for them and, often, book early.</p>
<p>Doing your homework can pay off big for families, said Mike Driscoll, editor of Cruise Week, an industry newsletter.</p>
<p>Compared with a typical resort, "cruises are so much cheaper because the food is included and so are many of the activities," said Driscoll, who has taken his children, now 17 and 15, on more than 25 cruises.</p>
<p>As cruise lines head into the prime family travel season with empty berths, certain destinations are less expensive than ever.</p>
<p>"For the first time, Alaska is becoming affordable for mass-market family vacations," Driscoll said.</p>
<p>Fares for summer Alaska cruises were recently 30 per cent to 40 per cent less than last year, he added, with a few drifting under $400 US a week. One reason, he said, is that nearly every sailing had some space.</p>
<p>As much as regular fares have fallen in the last few months, children's fares may be even less: half the adult fare, or as little as $99 US in some recent promotions. Shipboard credits can pile up hundreds in savings.</p>
<p>It's difficult to figure how long these deals will last. Early discounting has filled some cabins, and Spencer Brown thinks the market may be on the upswing.</p>
<p>"If you haven't gotten a great deal by now, you'll miss out in a month or two or find the great deals are harder to come by," she said.</p>
<p>One wild card that could affect pricing, she added, was the H1N1 flu outbreak, which could depress travel demand or shift it to new destinations.</p>
<p>To keep on top of the changes, engage a travel agent who specializes in cruises, said Pauline Frommer, creator of Pauline Frommer's Travel Guides, a new series aimed at adult budget travellers.</p>
<p>When fares drop, agents can rebook you at the lower fare.</p>
<p>"No one is going to alert you unless you have an agent," Frommer said.</p>
<p>Because agents earn commissions from cruise lines, their services typically cost you nothing.</p>
<p>Agents can also help you find ships with a plethora of activities to keep kids out of mischief.</p>
<p>Once onboard, safeguard the family budget by taking several steps:</p>
<p>- Control key cards: These cards typically give you and your children access to your credit line as well as your cabin. In young hands, Spencer Brown said, they are "a loaded weapon" that can add hundreds of dollars to your bill when kids buy soft drinks, gifts and more.</p>
<p>"Kids are so naive," she said. "They don't understand that someone will have to pay for this at the end of the day."</p>
<p>Educate them. For extra insurance, keep the key card with you whenever possible, or ask the ship's purser to put dollar limits on your child's card.</p>
<p>- Buy a beverage package: Often costing less than $10 a day, this covers the purchase of non-alcoholic drinks and can save you a bundle.</p>
<p>- Beware of game arcades: "They're like casinos for kids," Spencer Brown said. One mother on Royal Caribbean's Independence of the Seas reported that her children blew $10 in about 31/2 minutes, she said. Set limits.</p>
<p>- Be your own tour guide: Shore excursions organized by cruise lines, while often worthwhile, can be pricey, Driscoll said. And bus tours can try a child's patience.</p>
<p>Instead, he suggested you plot your own shore excursions, especially in kid-friendly ports in Alaska.</p>
<p>Striking out on your own takes research, but it's family time well spent.</p>

</div><div>Jodie Sinnema and Andrew Mayeda   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>392 words</div><div>10 May 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>EDMONTON -- Canada recorded its first death associated with the swine flu last week while numbers of confirmed cases in B.C. continued to climb yesterday.</p>
<p>B.C. had 79 confirmed cases of H1N1 swine flu as of yesterday, up from 60 the day before. Across the country, the total number of confirmed cases reached 280 yesterday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the death of a Northern Alberta woman last week is Canada's first associated with swine flu, but no one knows if H1N1 killed her, officials said Friday.</p>
<p>The woman, identified by family members as a 39-year-old who checked herself into hospital in High Prairie with asthma problems, died April 28.</p>
<p>Doctors didn't suspect the flu virus. On May 5, her mother, who shared a house with her on a Northern Alberta Metis settlement, was found to have a mild form of the disease caused by the H1N1 virus. On May 7, a provincial lab confirmed the dead woman had the same virus, Alberta officials said Friday.</p>
<p>Nurses are now in the remote Northern Alberta community about 350 kilometres northwest of Edmonton to help monitor the situation. About 300 people attended the woman's wake last week, and they are being advised to contact public health officials if they start feeling sick.</p>
<p>Those with other medical problems who get sick are being treated with Tamiflu, an anti-influenza drug.</p>
<p>Neither the dead woman nor her relative diagnosed with swine flu have any history of travel to or from Mexico.</p>
<p>A typical seasonal flu makes thousands of Canadians sick and kills an average of 4,000 Canadians every year -- about 26 of them Albertans.</p>
<p>The death is making Alberta look like a flu hot spot, however. The province also recorded the first hospitalization due to swine flu -- a young girl in Edmonton whose condition is improving -- and the first instance of the new flu strain being found in pigs.</p>
<p>In all but two of the cases in Canada, the patients have recovered at home.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the WHO had confirmed 3,440 cases worldwide in 29 countries, with Argentina, Australia, Japan and Panama all reporting their first confirmed cases. Forty-five deaths have been confirmed in Mexico and two in the U.S.</p>

</p>
<p>Every week in this space, we look at some of what happened over the past seven days on Metropolitan News, The Gazette's blog about Montreal.</p>
<p>First, our Twitter-style, 140-character review of the last week in Montreal: "SUMMER'S HERE! rain. SWINE FLU PANDEMIC! not. Tremblay closes two parks just in time for summer, remembers it's election year, reopens them."</p>
<p>Among other things, the blog looked at a Los Angeles street - Beaudry Ave. - that celebrates a Montrealer. An excerpt:</p>
<p>"Reader Christopher Ray Miller, commenting on a blog item about a mysterious Montreal-related corner in St. Paul, Minn., pointed out another interesting bit of Montreal trivia. Here's what we learned.</p>
<p>"Prudent Beaudry, who was born in Ste. Anne des Plaines, north of Montreal, and was mayor of Los Angeles from 1874 to 1876, is remembered as a visionary businessman and politician in L.A. (Brother Jean-Louis Beaudry, a colourful character in his own right, was mayor of Montreal three times between 1862 and 1885.)</p>
<p>"In Los Angeles A to Z: An Encyclopedia of the City and County, Dale Pitt writes that Prudent Beaudry 'made a small fortune developing hillside lots (in) downtown (L.A.). He bought all the land on Bunker Hill for $51 in 1867 and piped water to its lots in the 1870s. During his term as mayor, he pioneered welfare institutions, established hospitals, and fostered expansion of the city's water system.'</p>
<p>"When Beaudry - who made and lost several fortunes before he died in 1893 - died, the Los Angeles Times said of him: "In his official capacity he was noted for his fearless honesty and his active advocacy of all measures looking for the benefit of the city. ... His wealth was always kept occupied in developing new enterprises, and thus was diffused among the poorer people."</p>

<p>Quebec confirmed four new cases of swine flu yesterday, including a second one at Collège Charlemagne in Pierrefonds. The number of infected people in the province now stands at 15 and all cases are considered mild.</p>
<p>Public health authorities said three of the new patients are in the Montreal area and had no history of travel.</p>
<p>Alain Poirier, director of Quebec's Public Health Department, said they caught the virus in their communities. One of them is a student at Collége Charlemagne where another previous case has been confirmed.</p>
<p>"The child has been isolated and the school has been informed," Poirier said. "There is no cause for worry, the parents have been well informed."</p>
<p>There is another student infected in the Montreal area, while the third new case is an adult. The fourth case is a high school student from Quebec City who recently traveled to New York City.</p>
<p>Poirier emphasized Quebecers should not be troubled about the recent surge of cases because the virus doesn't appear to be virulent in the province.</p>
<p>He repeated that there is no need to close Collége Charlemagne or other schools where students have been infected.</p>
<p>"Based on what we know about the virus, it's not a good idea to close schools," Poirier said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Country is ready to handle pandemic, doctors say; Canadian Medical Association says preparations much better than for 2003 SARS outbreak</b>
</div><div>SHARON KIRKEY   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>505 words</div><div>9 May 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Despite being inundated with dire warnings about a flu pandemic, Canadians should know the country is in good shape to tackle a full outbreak should it happen, the head of the Canadian Medical Association says.</p>
<p>"Canadians should be reassured that everything will be done" in the event of a worldwide influenza pandemic, including moving doctors between provinces or bringing retired health workers back into the system if needed, Dr. Robert Ouellet said.</p>
<p>"We are much more prepared than we were" during the SARS outbreak of 2003 that killed 44 Canadians, Ouellet said.</p>
<p>"There were a lot of problems with communication," he said in an interview with Canwest News Service and Global National.</p>
<p>"We didn't have (testing) kits. ... Now we have vaccines, we have kits that are prepared and we have literature and communication that are available and we have a new public health agency of Canada. So this is a big difference.</p>
<p>"I don't think there is a danger for this influenza pandemic right now."</p>
<p>A full-scale pandemic could lead to ethical questions around the duty to care, and whether health-care workers would have an unbound obligation to care for the sick and dying if it means putting their own safety at risk.</p>
<p>"Of course it's a dilemma," Ouellet said.</p>
<p>"But I think that doctors and medical providers are there to serve the patient. We could try to give them as much protection as possible so that they can stay on the job and help people."</p>
<p>Officials say that, should a pandemic arrive, it would most likely strike hardest during the usual flu season, December to March, and occur in waves.</p>
<p>Only one province - Ontario - has a formal agreement with the federal government to share information about disease outbreaks, an agreement signed during the fallout from SARS. Ouellet said all provinces and territories should have such agreements. "I don't know if it should be legally (binding), but at least from the point of view of patient safety, they should do that, they should share information with the federal government."</p>
<p>Still, the question remains: how prepared are front-line physicians to cope with a potential onslaught of patients with flu?</p>
<p>"Any thought that we'll drop everything we do and suddenly take on full-time flu management is a non-starter," said Stewart Cameron, a family physician in Halifax and an associate professor of family medicine at Dalhousie University.</p>
<p>Flu patients require special handling and special equipment to prevent the virus from spreading "to us, our staff and other patients in our waiting room," he said.</p>
<p>The solution instead is special assessment centres to handle people with flu or flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>One such clinic, staffed by nurses and volunteer physicians, was set up in Windsor, N.S., northeast of Halifax, after an outbreak of swine flu among students at a private boarding school.</p>

</p>
<p>Do you have what it takes to run a successful Ponzi scheme?</p>
<p>Now you can channel your inner Bernie Madoff through a new mobile phone game that encourages players to swindle as much money as they can before getting busted by the feds.</p>
<p>Online gaming network Cellufun plans to release "Made Off" on Monday; the game's title is a play on the recently convicted rip-off mastermind who stole billions of dollars in the largest known Ponzi scheme in history.</p>
<p>"Always wanted to rob, cheat, and steal from innocent investors? Well now's your chance!" reads the tag line to the game, which can be played on any mobile phone with a data plan, as well as on Cellufun's website, said Keith Katz, Cellufun's vice-president of marketing.</p>
<p>"If you don't laugh, you have to cry," said Keith Katz, Cellufun's vice-president of marketing. "People are interested in Ponzi schemes right now because of Madoff. It's just like how Monopoly came out after the Great Depression."</p>
<p>You can choose to be a fund manager, in which the goal is to get as many Cellufun players to invest in your fund as possible, then use the investments to pay off some investors and keep the rest of the money for yourself.</p>
<p>Or, if you're not the Madoff type, you can play as an investor, who must choose which funds to invest in and then decide when to get out before the fund gets shut down.</p>
<p>Cellufun employees act as the Feds, and can randomly shut down a fund at any time.</p>
<p>Games based on news events aren't a new phenomenon, said Scott Steinberg, the publisher of gadgets and games review site DigitalTrends.com.</p>
<p>"You see all sorts of casual games lampoon everything from pop culture to fast food to 9/11," he said. "Life comes at you fast. You need an outlet to unwind, and what better way to do that than with games?"</p>
<p>Steinberg pointed to other news-related games, such as the "Presidential Pong" game that came out during the 2000 Al Gore/George Bush recount ordeal. "Games get used as social commentary," he said. "They're there to alleviate the tension."</p>
<p>And not just from Ponzi schemes. Other recent games: "Swinefighter," and "Swine Flu: Hamdemic."</p>

<p>Bulls & Bears is a review of select market performances</p>
<p>by Canwest News business writer John Morrissy.</p>
<p>Bear - Hog futures</p>
<p>On the Chicago</p>
<p>Mercantile Exchange</p>
<p>Friday close: 68.5 cents US, up 2.93 cents US on the week</p>
<p>What do you do when you're branded, and you know you're a hog? There's no solid proof the poor porkers are the cause of swine flu, but that hasn't stopped governments from banning imports and, in at least one country, culling herds. A rasher decision couldn't have been made, cried producers, as the</p>
<p>bacon bits of the future crumbled in value.</p>
<p>Bull - <span class="companylink">Heritage Oil Limited</span></p>
<p>On the TSX</p>
<p>Friday close: $10.89,</p>
<p>up $3.39 on the week</p>
<p>Thank goodness Gary Bettman isn't in charge of the oil business. If he was, everyone would be drilling, futilely, in the deserts of Arizona. But he's not, and that's good news for Heritage Oil. The Calgary-based concern announced Wednesday that a single well drilled in Iraq had uncovered a pool containing up to four billion barrels of oil.</p>
<p>Bull - <span class="companylink">First Quantum Minerals Ltd</span>.</p>
<p>On the TSX</p>
<p>Friday close: $54.49,</p>
<p>up $6.47 on the week</p>
<p>A quick review of the TSX so far this year shows that metal miners, and particularly copper players, were the place to be. Of the exchange's 10 top performers, nine were miners, and the best was First Quantum, up 209 per cent. Which is all fine and dandy, as long as the downturn left you any money to invest.</p>
<p>Bull - <span class="companylink">Estee Lauder Companies Inc</span>.</p>
<p>On the NYSE</p>
<p>Friday close: $33.90 US,</p>
<p>up $2.77 US on the week</p>
<p>At first blush, <span class="companylink">Estee Lauder</span>'s third-quarter numbers looked like they deserved a lashing. But like most other things these days, being not as bad as expected was enough to give its shares a lift, even though the cosmetics maker warned the future may not be blemish-free. Is that enough to build a foundation on?</p>
<p>Bull - <span class="companylink">Denny's Corp</span>.</p>
<p>On the Nasdaq</p>

<p>The days were rolling along with as much regularity as possible in Tijuana, Mexico, so Darryl Brinkley headed to the ballpark for a workout every morning for the past week.</p>
<p>As far as he was concerned, it was business as usual for the Golden Baseball League expansion Potros.</p>
<p>But that business suddenly took a couple of unusual turns when the franchise suspended operations for the season because of the financial side-effects of the H1N1 influenza, and then the veteran outfielder was snagged by the Edmonton Capitals with the sixth pick in the Potros player dispersal draft Friday.</p>
<p>"My agent told me that there was a chance I could end up there. I was getting pumped up about the idea," Brinkley said when contacted in Mexico.</p>
<p>"I always liked playing in that area. But up until today, we were here practising every morning. There are still some guys walking about thinking this thing might be a go.</p>
<p>"It really hasn't been that bad," he said about the influenza virus.</p>
<p>"Nobody is wearing masks anymore ... and to be honest, they have bigger problems here than that, like the violence." The tireless 40-year-old spent two-plus seasons with the Calgary Vipers, including the 2007 campaign when he became the first player in Northern League history to bat .400 and was named Baseball America's independent leagues player of the year.</p>
<p>Undrafted by a Major League Baseball team, the journeyman had his one shot at the majors derailed because of the terrorist attacks in 2001. Brinkley went to Australia when he wasn't recalled by the Baltimore Orioles from the Triple A International League after the big league rosters expanded on Sept. 1. The Orioles later recalled him on Sept. 10 but he was stranded Down Under, so the team instead brought up Tim Raines Jr.</p>
<p>"I get asked that question a lot and there are times you get tired of it all, but when the game starts, you just want to beat that pitcher. The adrenaline kicks in. You're into the game ... I guess the fire is still there," he said. "Hopefully, I can help the team in Edmonton." Capitals manager Brent Bowers was set on securing Brinkley or passing on the remaining eight players on the draft board.</p>
<p>"Gosh, for a guy who is 40, and the way he plays the game ... glad to have him," said Bowers, who will have to release a player before the season opener on May 21 to make room for Brinkley on the roster.</p>
<p>"It will become a numbers game, but when a guy like that comes available, it has to be done." The Capitals will hold an open tryout camp today at Telus Field, then the roster players (minus Brinkley) will begin their workouts. Among them will be shortstop Max Poulin, who was signed as a free agent after spending the previous eight seasons with the Winnipeg Goldeyes.</p>
<p>"(Brinkley) is a great veteran. He's going to help this team for sure -- just with his experience," Poulin said. "He's played at a lot of different levels."</p>

<p>- One good thing about Jasper Avenue: It's hard to tell if we're in a recession or a boom. It looks pretty much the same all the time.</p>
<p>- Recently, my wife and I went to the Edmonton City Centre for an afternoon movie and some shopping. Less than five hours in the City Centre parkade cost $18. The movie was actually cheaper than the parking. That's the last dime I will ever spend downtown.</p>
<p>- I figured out a way to avoid parking tickets downtown. I took the wipers off my car.</p>
<p>- In light of the latest condo fire, I'm wondering when building officials will recognize that residences built for more than one family should have cement floors, ceilings and walls.</p>
<p>- Is it any wonder the plywood palaces that are built out here in Alberta go up like a torch?</p>
<p>- If architect Gene Dub helps design the redevelopment of the municipal airport lands, look for a plethora of pyramids.</p>
<p>- I feel faint. Is Mayor Mandel actually demonstrating leadership on the airport issue?</p>
<p>- Good on the mayor for trying to convince people we don't really need the old municipal airport. We could develop that land and help the city raise needed capital for everything.</p>
<p>- Having the LRT going to a new development on the old airport site would not be as cool as having the LRT going to a new downtown airport.</p>
<p>- It's too bad we lost the trolley buses. The sale of the airport lands could have more than made up for the costs associated with that environmentally friendly mode of transportation.</p>
<p>- For the trolley buses,</p>
<p>I'll fondly shed a tear.</p>
<p>But when those ugly overhead power wires come down,</p>
<p>I'll be smiling ear-to-ear.</p>
<p>- The only difference between Tasering someone to death and shooting them to death is the noise.</p>
<p>- I think the word you're looking for is pigpendemic.</p>
<p>- So, schools won't tell parents if the girl with a serious case of swine flu attends their school, but if something really dangerous, like teaching evolution, is going to occur, parents will be the first to know.</p>
<p>- By all means, let's ensure parental rights to keep their kids ignorant.</p>
<p>- How many people are pushing for parental rights embodied in Bill 44? A lot more than are pushing to have sex changes paid for by Alberta Health.</p>
<p>- As a medical student I studied, under the microscope, the first few cell divisions of both the fertilized fish egg and the human ovum. Surprise -- they are just about identical. Surely this tells us something about evolution.</p>
<p>- Is it so hard for you to let me believe I have fingernails, a tailbone, and muscles that move pretty much everything on my body because God put them there?</p>
<p>- Evolution is an irrefutable scientific fact? Not even diehard evolutionists make that claim anymore.</p>
<p>- If there was evolution, why are there still apes?</p>
<p>- Ontario has a population of 13 million, and 107 seats in its legislature. Alberta has 83 seats for a population of 3.5 million. Explain to me why we need four more seats rather than decreasing the number by at least 30.</p>
<p>- After the next election, the Liberals can resume shifting "green" from the West to the East, where it belongs.</p>
<p>- The only way the left-of-centre political parties will end the love fest with the Conservatives is to bury their egos, find common ground, and merge into one party to represent the majority of us.</p>
<p>- Hit-and-runs are still hit-and-runs, even if you hit someone driving</p>
<p>a scooter. I'm still alive and very angry.</p>
<p>- A pedestrian gestured for me to slow down. I was going 50 km/h in a 50 zone. She was jaywalking. Which of us was breaking the law?</p>
<p>- Someone would have to be a sociopathic bully to do what was done to those two beautiful dogs in Strathcona County.</p>
<p>- If Canada bans all goods from China, our stores will be empty.</p>
<p>- If you don't like the weather in Edmonton, look out another window.</p>

</p>
<p>A northern Alberta woman has become Canada's first fatality associated with swine flu, although health officials don't yet know if the H1N1 virus killed her.</p>
<p>The woman, identified by family members as 39-year-old Tina L'Hirondelle, died April 28 after checking herself into the High Prairie hospital with asthma problems, family members say.</p>
<p>Doctors didn't suspect the flu virus because she didn't have typical flu symptoms. They believed she died of pre-existing medical problems. But on May 5, when her mother was found to have a mild form of the swine flu, the province immediately took a closer look at the death. The two women lived together in the Gift Lake Métis Settlement, 75 kilometres northeast of High Prairie</p>
<p>On May 7, a provincial lab confirmed that L'Hirondelle had the same virus, Alberta officials said Friday. The chronology of the illness implies she gave it to her mother, who is recovering, but remains under quarantine while receiving anti-retroviral drugs.</p>
<p>The early investigation suggests neither woman had been to Mexico or had contact with other travellers.</p>
<p>"I would like to begin by offering my sincerest condolences to the family," said Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"All deaths come as a surprise. We have to acknowledge the fact, though, with every influenza season, influenza as a virus can trigger a worsening of pre-existing medical conditions."</p>
<p>Nurses are in Gift Lake and have set up a medical clinic in the hamlet's youth centre. They are monitoring about 300 people who attended L'Hirondelle's wake, community members said.</p>
<p>Anyone who would have been infected should have experienced symptoms by now, since the flu's incubation period is approximately seven days, but no hospital staff have reported illness, health officials say.</p>
<p>Kelly Cunningham, L'Hirondelle's cousin, attended her wake. At the time, no one knew L'Hirondelle had passed the flu on to her mother.</p>
<p>"I saw people go up to her (mother), hug her, kiss her on the cheek, give condolences to her," said Cunningham, who hasn't felt the need to get tested. The last time he spoke with L'Hirondelle a few months ago, she told him she had been in and out of hospital with asthma. Cunningham also believed she had diabetes.</p>
<p>"It is very hard," he said, describing his cousin as a happy, well-rounded person who liked to go out with friends to watch hockey and baseball. She also worked at the Métis Settlement office and had siblings across Alberta.</p>
<p>Cunningham's wife, Erica, said fewer than half the children at the local school attended classes Friday. Erica also saw a woman driving around with a face mask.</p>
<p>"There's the fear," Erica said. "People are taking the precautionary measures."</p>
<p>Glen L'Hirondelle, a distant relative of Tina, said he attended her wake, but doesn't have many concerns, although he was dealing with an intestinal problem he attributed to food.</p>
<p>His son and daughter are just getting over colds with dry coughs, but haven't been tested for the flu.</p>
<p>"It's more or less all talk," Glen said. "More or less, people are scaring each other."</p>
<p>Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services, said it won't be known until next week if L'Hirondelle died from the flu or from complications from her existing medical issues. A pathologist has yet to look at a sample of her lung tissue, taken after an autopsy was done.</p>
<p>Corriveau said there should be no cause for immediate concern in Alberta.</p>
<p>About 26 people die in Alberta from the flu each year. "It's something that happens usually in vulnerable people, whatever age they might be at," he said.</p>
<p>Corriveau said the H1N1 virus is behaving like any other flu virus.</p>
<p>"It's basically telling us one more time that we don't seem to be facing a novel virus that's behaving out of the normal," Corriveau said. "Our health-care system is doing all it needs to do and our public health folks, we're on the ball on this case right from the get-go."</p>
<p>Not everyone in Gift Lake agreed.</p>
<p>"This could have been handled better," said one long-term resident, who didn't want to be named. He wasn't reassured when he attended the temporary health clinic in the youth centre.</p>
<p>"I wasn't too impressed when I went in there to get information for my family," he said.</p>
<p>"As soon as I walked in, the health guys backed up against the wall and pulled up their masks. It's like they assume everyone is sick. I would have liked a verbal presentation, but they just hand us pamphlets. We want to know what's going on."</p>
<p>NDP Leader Brian Mason accused Health Minister Ron Liepert and Corriveau of "violating the No. 1 rule of epidemics" by withholding information and not telling the public more about this case, and that of a little girl from the Edmonton area who was hospitalized with the flu .</p>
<p>Their decisions "created fear and panic among the population," he said Mason suggested Corriveau "failed his first test" as chief medical officer.</p>
<p>"I hold them responsible for the public reaction, for the public not being well-informed, and more fearful than they need to be," Mason said.</p>
<p>Liepert said Alberta Health is abiding by privacy rules.</p>
<p>Up to "400 people annually in Alberta die from the flu," Liepert said from Calgary. "I'm not going to try and downplay this particular situation, but we have to put it into context."</p>
<p>In addition to L'Hirondelle's flu case, the province had eight other new swine flu cases Friday, bringing the provincial total to 42 cases. The new cases involved three children and six adults who all had mild symptoms and are recovering at home. Some had travelled to Mexico or were in contact with travellers. Others had no travel history.</p>
<p>As of Friday afternoon, 44 people had died from the flu in Mexico and two more in the United States.</p>

<p>Re: "UN loses even more credibility over flu," Barry Cooper, Opinion, May 6.</p>
<p>Barry Cooper should stick to a subject he knows something about. Instead of berating Dr. Margaret Chan and the WHO, we should be grateful that the H1N1 influenza appears not to be as virulent as once had been feared. Between 50 million and 100 million people died of flu in 1918. It was not the young or the weak elderly who comprised most of the dead, but people between the age of 20 and 40 with strong immune systems. Surely, it is better to overreact to a flu outbreak than wait for a devastating world epidemic. Remember that potentially the virus is only one mutation away from becoming lethal.</p>
<p>Try the CDC website (U. S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta). It says: "CDC continues to take aggressive action to respond to the expanding outbreak" and was updated May 6. Instead of understanding this sensible practice, Cooper chooses to trot out the same anti-UN right-wing drivel.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>He can't skate around this one; What Lafleur did was wrong and he should face the music</b>
</div><div>HENRY AUBIN   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>762 words</div><div>9 May 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>A misguided wave of support has emerged for Guy Lafleur, convicted last week of giving a court contradictory evidence - essentially, perjury. Many bloggers, newspaper-letter writers and pundits are leaping to his defence.</p>
<p>In a 2007 court case, the hockey great testified under oath that his adult son had obeyed a court-ordered curfew and was at his parents' home during a weekend away from his drug-rehab centre. The truth, however, was that Lafleur - who had promised the authorities to supervise his son - had driven him to a hotel to spend two nights with a girlfriend. The former Canadiens star later said he thought this intimacy would benefit his son.</p>
<p>Two high-profile La Presse columnists have helped stoke public indignation over the conviction. Réjean Tremblay wrote that Lafleur was a diligent "père de famille" who is now "paying for having had the courage to help his son." His colleague Lysiane Gagnon deplored the court's "odious treatment of this man whose only crime is to have done everything he could to save a child of whom many other fathers, in his place, would have washed their hands."</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>A good father not only looks out for his children. He looks also out for other children. Good parents, that is, put themselves in the shoes of other parents; they make sure their own children don't act against the interests of other children. If your child has symptoms of swine flu, you don't send him out to play with others.</p>
<p>Consider this: Lafleur's son, Mark Lafleur, was 22 at the time. The girl whom the so-called devoted father took his son to see was 16. She was a child; he was an adult.</p>
<p>If one of my daughters at 16 were dating a fellow that much older, I wouldn't like it. And I especially would not like it if the young man had Mark Lafleur's record in romance.</p>
<p>At the time of the hotel rendezvous, Mark Lafleur was assigned to the rehab centre while out on bail on various charges stemming from an earlier relationship with a 17-year-old girl. Guy Lafleur knew of these accusations. His son pled guilty the following year to 14 of them. They included six counts of assault, three of forcible confinement, two of making death threats, and one each of armed assault, mischief, and theft.</p>
<p>Not quite the boy next door, as a third La Presse columnist, Yves Boisvert, has noted.</p>
<p>What did that earlier girlfriend's parents think of the relationship? They showed up at his condo to retrieve their daughter, the father carrying a baseball bat. In court, the mother described her daughter as a "walking dead girl."</p>
<p>I have some sympathy for Mark Lafleur. He was born with Tourette's syndrome, a neurological disorder sometimes linked to aggressive behaviour. The issue in this controversy is not his conduct. It's his father's.</p>
<p>Quebec Court judge Claude Parent found Guy Lafleur guilty of misleading the court when he led it to believe his son had respected the curfew. Contrary to what Lafleur's supporters suggest, this offence is no trivial matter.</p>
<p>A lot of people don't take bail conditions seriously. They flout them. The accused people assume that no one will ever know, and too often they are right. The same is also true when judges impose conditions on people who go free after being found guilty: We hear all the time - when it's too late - of men who are under order to not get within a certain distance of their ex- wives - but do so anyway.</p>
<p>Perjury is another common problem. The courts, swamped as they are, seldom do much about it.</p>
<p>Guy Lafleur's actions showed as little respect for bail conditions and sworn testimony as they did for the welfare of the 16-year-old girl. For the court to have acquitted this celebrity would have reinforced a public perception that the law can be mocked with impunity.</p>
<p>The law provides for up to 14 years in jail for this offence.</p>
<p>I don't think Lafleur should go to prison. The sentence should exclude imprisonment yet should nonetheless be exemplary, including a meaningful amount of community service. The signal that this case sends matters.</p>

<p>Re: "European hypocrisy plumbs new depths" (Editorial, May 8).</p>
<p>Yes, it is difficult to understand the European Union's boycott of all seal products, many from Canada, and yet try to imagine all the other animals killed or injured for food purposes, for sport, for clothing accessories, or for toiletries and cosmetics in those same European countries. But rationality has very little to do with human behaviour.</p>
<p>The world's resources are directed toward fighting the H1N1 flu virus even though most scientific data indicates it is unnecessary; a country decides to kill all their swine due to that virus; persons coming from Mexico are denied access to schools even if they show no signs of flu; a borough mayor,  given free access to a hockey game by a company with which it is doing business, argues that she is just a spectator like everyone else there, while conveniently omitting that most of them have paid for their admission; a city mayor finds it normal to admit not knowing what is going within his administration; the province finds it acceptable that no conflict-of-interest rules exist for its municipalities; and, our federal politicians spend their time discussing the materials to be used in the Canadian athletes' uniforms for the Vancouver Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>It is irrational to expect that groups or individuals will always act rationally.</p>

<p>Everybody is so busy discussing swine flu that the true pandemic du jour is slipping under the radar. We're talking Starbucksitis here folks. Symptoms include 24/7 coffee breath, attempted use of the word "venti" in the real world and a cup permanently affixed to one's palm. Gripped by separation anxiety, sufferers usually make a point of toting a gigantic beverage on a long-haul flight. But where to put the awkward vessel? Try a Cup Pilot. It attaches to the tray table whether opened or closed, folds to stow in a pouch and can also grip the seat back or a suitcase. In the event of turbulence, it acts like a seatbelt for your java. However, please note that Cup Pilot accepts no responsibility should your caffeine buzz come to a crash landing.</p>

</p>
<p>Warning: Swine flu could be bad for art.</p>
<p>The potential spread of the H1N1 virus is one threat to attendance, revenues and jobs at the National Gallery of Canada this summer, and could push the federal institution into a deficit, gallery director Marc Mayer said in an e-mail to employees this week.</p>
<p>In an effort to trim costs, avoid a deficit, prevent layoffs and save exhibitions planned for this year, Mayer invited employees to take unpaid leaves or early retirement. They have a week to decide whether to stay or to go.</p>
<p>"I am writing about our financial situation and our obligation to reach the fiscal year end 2009-10 with a balanced budget," said Mayer's e-mail. "We are faced with a global economic crisis that will seriously impact visitor attendance and related revenues and donations. We are hearing daily about a potential serious health-care crisis which could have an additional impact." In the e-mail, obtained by the Citizen, employees are asked to decide their own futures by May 15. Job sharing and moving from full-time to part-time work are suggested, along with unpaid leaves and early retirement.</p>
<p>"After evaluating the impact that these voluntary measures may produce, we will be in a better position to minimize the impact of more difficult choices that may still be required," Mayer's e-mail concluded.</p>
<p>That sounds like the threat of layoffs.</p>
<p>"We are looking at every other option before that," Joanne Charette, the gallery's director of public affairs, said in an interview Friday.</p>
<p>The president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service, the union that represents gallery curators, said it was highly unusual to give staff only eight days to decide on early retirement or unpaid leave.</p>
<p>"They're desperate to reduce staff," Gary Corbett said after reading Mayer's e-mail. "This is not an indication of an employer who knows what it's doing." Corbett said the gallery's attitude to its curators is indicative of a government-wide lack of appreciation for scientists and arts-related professionals.</p>
<p>The gallery's anticipated budget for this fiscal year, according to the institution's last five-year plan, is about $61 million, of which $8 million must be used for art acquisitions. The five-year plan anticipated about $10 million to come from donations and revenues generated by the gallery. The rest would come from the federal government.</p>
<p>Charette declined to put even an approximate figure on how large a deficit the gallery is trying to prevent, at least in part because of uncertainty over how much the government will give the gallery.</p>
<p>Some measures have already been taken to trim program costs, she said, but all exhibitions previously announced will go ahead.</p>
<p>Mayer's e-mail says the amount of money the gallery spends on salaries and other expenses can simply not continue.</p>
<p>"Over the last number of weeks, we have been reviewing our financial projections and have had to reduce our anticipated spending in several areas. The senior management team has had discussions regarding our business model; we have carefully reviewed our exhibition program budget and framework; and our staffing levels across the gallery. We are not confident that we will have enough resources to fund our anticipated expenditures." The gallery goes through serious cost-cutting exercises periodically, sometimes because of the unreliability of government funding. Last year, the government reduced its financing of the gallery by five per cent, and a handful of jobs were cut.</p>
<p>The gallery's revenues are also very dependent upon the popularity of its exhibitions. A Renoir exhibition, for example, is considered a sure-fire money-maker, but, Charette noted, "this is not a Renoir year." The gallery's main show this summer, traditionally the busiest season, is From Raphael to Carracci: The Art of Papal Rome. The show deals with 16th century art by Raphael, Michelangelo and other famous artists who left their mark on Rome in that period. It opens May 29.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A second eatery pushes for patio - It's on Academy Road again</b>
</div><div>By Bartley Kives   </div>
<div>571 words</div><div>9 May 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Less than a week after city council quashed an appeal against a pizzeria patio on Academy Road, a neighbouring restaurant will appear at city hall to request permission to open its own patio.</p>
<p>J. Fox's Restaurant & Local will appear before the board of adjustment on Wednesday to seek permission to open a 24-seat patio along Academy Road one block west of where Pizzeria Gusto just won the right to open its own 30-seat patio.</p>
<p>Several dozen River Heights residents opposed the pizzeria patio on the grounds it would pave the way for more commercial development along Academy Road and create a new Corydon Village on the west side of River Heights.</p>
<p>City planners are recommending the board of adjustment approve J. Fox's patio, provided it closes at 10 p.m. every day and have no amplified music.</p>
<p>A patio operated in front of the same business when it was occupied by a previous tenant, the Academy Bar & Eatery, which has since moved to Osborne Village.</p>
<p>J. Fox's owner, Daniel Pedley, said the previous tenant never had city approval to open a patio.</p>
<p>He hopes nearby residents will allow him to demonstrate his "comfort food" restaurant is a good fit for the community, even if he isn't catering to the high-end clientele sought by Pizzeria Gusto.</p>
<p>"I'm not a flash in the pan. I want this place to be here in 25 years," said Pedley, who opened J. Fox's one year ago as Johnnie Fox's Irish Pub.</p>
<p>The same board of adjustment meeting will see another Corydon Village restaurant apply for a patio -- Fazzo, a bistro at 905 Corydon Ave. City planners are recommending the board approve this application, again provided the 30-seat patio close at 10 p.m. and have no amplified music.</p>
<p>Boot camps must pay to use parks</p>
<p>FITNESS boot camps and other businesses that operate inside city parks will soon have to ask for permission and pay for the privilege.</p>
<p>Proposed changes to the city parks bylaw will require boot camps to seek permission to operate in parks for up to four hours at a time and pay $735 per week, $1,470 per month or $3,675 for an entire May-to-October season, depending how long they operate, according to a report published late Thursday.</p>
<p>A new parks bylaw heads before city council's protection and community services committee on Monday. It also calls for the elimination of standard closing hours for about 1,000 city parks and open spaces.</p>
<p>"What that means is if there's a park that's not being used after a certain time, it could close a little earlier," said St. Vital Coun. Gord Steeves, who chairs the protection committee.</p>
<p>The new bylaw also makes it clear that it is illegal to dump garbage, snow, yard waste or construction debris inside city parks and creates minimum fines for violators.</p>
<p>City's EMO boss leaves</p>
<p>WINNIPEG'S point man on spring-flood and swine-flu preparation has left the city for a job at the University of Manitoba.</p>
<p>Randy Hull spent his last day as the city's emergency measures co-ordinator on Friday.</p>
<p>He will assume a new role handling risk management for the U of M.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Interpreting Canadian politicians' jargon is not a job for amateurs</b>
</div><div>WILLIAM CHRISTIAN   </div>
<div>654 words</div><div>9 May 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>Many of our political words derive from Latin. Legal comes from lex, legis, a law. State comes from status, a condition of stability. Liberty originates from libertas, whereas freedom, which we use almost interchangeably, derives from a German word, Freiheit.</p>
<p>As you can see, to understand politics, you need a professional with years of training and decades of experiences observing the Canadian political scene before you can begin to make any sense out of it at all. It is not something an untrained amateur should attempt, and you should certainly not allow children under the age of 16 to watch the parliamentary channel. It is best to block Newsworld if you have youngsters under five.</p>
<p>Let me attempt to explain some of the phrases you may have heard recently.</p>
<p>A few of these are difficult.</p>
<p>"My fellow Canadians." Michael Ignatieff used this term many times during his speech to the leadership convention in Vancouver. Since his speech was broadcast on Newsworld about 6 p.m. on a Saturday, his audience would have consisted mostly of hockey fans who were looking for the Canucks game and couldn't figure out the start time because of the time zone difference. Although there are some 32 million Canadians, "my fellow Canadians" is a phrase that means approximately one hundred thousand.</p>
<p>"The Liberal caucus is evenly divided about the desirability of a summer election." There are 77 Liberal MPs, so it is hard to see how they could be evenly divided, unless one of them kept changing his mind, or was undecided, irresolute, or, like a character in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, could believe more than one impossible thing at the same time.</p>
<p>Still, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Translated by a professional such as myself, the phrase means "38 and a half Liberal MPs" are stark raving mad and completely out of touch with reality. The party can't afford to run an election campaign. Its political organization isn't organized. It has only one policy (equalizing EI entitlement) and, if it had the misfortune to get elected, the best it could do is to pray that the economy fixed itself as quickly as possible. However, if prayers are going to fix the economy, we are probably better leaving the Conservatives in power, since they have more MPs from the Bible Belt.</p>
<p>"The Liberals will decide the timing of the next election." When I use the technical, political science term, in a pig's eye, you don't have to grab for hand sanitizer before you continue reading. This kind of pig has nothing to do with swine flu. This is the kind of pig as in: "I don't see any pigs flying outside my window. Therefore, I doubt that Jack Layton is going to help the Liberals bring down the government, devastate his own party, and get himself turfed out of his job."</p>
<p>The problem with moving the NDP away from its social democratic roots into the amorphous welfare liberal centre is that the Liberal party does welfare liberalism better. Now that it has a leader who is an articulate and principled centrist, the NDP runs the very serious risk of losing its centre-left supporters who want to see the Conservatives out of power. The easiest way for Layton to keep his own job is to make sure that Harper keeps his.</p>
<p>The philosopher who taught me to understand the political use of words was the 19th century thinker, Humpty Dumpty. " 'When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, 'it means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less.'"</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Let's get our health-care priorities straight</b>
</div><div>Grant Robinson   </div>
<div>622 words</div><div>9 May 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>I often wonder about the priorities we set on our health-care system. There is a tremendous amount of focus right now on the H1N1 flu. The actions we are being advised to take as individuals and the initiatives in the health care system are consuming scarce resources.</p>
<p>At the same time, Guelph General Hospital is making radical changes to increase the revenue, which is putting the existence of its pain clinic at risk.</p>
<p>Let's remember that flu happens -- but once any long-term service is removed from the system it may be gone for a long time. Let me make my case. I am receiving lots of email correspondence suggesting a number of things I should do in preparation for the flu pandemic. I should ensure that I have stocked up on food and keep gas in my car because one in three people will be so sick that the distribution systems will collapse and there will be shortages everywhere. The correspondence suggests that anybody who has been to Mexico should either be quarantined for 72 hours or receive medical clearance before they return to the office.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if every visitor to Mexico went to their family doctor or the emergency clinic on their return?</p>
<p>I find it difficult enough to get a doctor's appointment when I'm sick. Now, I'm being encouraged to see a doctor when I have no symptoms. And what can the doctors do anyway besides ask a few questions and, if there are no apparent symptoms, give me a medical clearance.</p>
<p>It doesn't make sense for us to further burden the health care system for routine issues. The media focus does seem to drive our spending.</p>
<p>I read about how I should wash my hands, sneeze into my arm and be responsible about being sick. If I'm sick I should stay home. This is an individual responsibility for our own health. This makes sense.</p>
<p>We're spending a tremendous amount of energy, time and money managing a potential pandemic flu virus which so far has had mild consequences. I have to think we are too focused on this one aspect of our health care.</p>
<p>I work with entrepreneurial and family businesses dealing with succession issues. Those situations that succeed are ones where people talk to each other, create a plan and transition roles, responsibilities and activities in a thoughtful and collaborative fashion.</p>
<p>What I'm hearing is the hospital has decided the pain clinic is too expensive. If the pain clinic needs to move then there should be a collaborative effort made to manage a transition from the hospital to another location. If the pain clinic can stay there should be a collaborative effort to fund a workable resolution. Solutions usually exist, if people take the time to find them.</p>
<p>The challenge with the pain clinic is I won't need it unless I have a lot of pain. But if I need the help I want the help locally. I certainly would like to see a continuation and growth of health care services, not a reduction of health care services in Guelph and Wellington.</p>
<p>I understand the hospital has significant funding issues. I also understand moving a pain clinic or dramatically changing its cost structure with two month's notice is not a good transitioning process.</p>
<p>Let's take some of the resources we are putting into flu preparations and find a collaborative transition plan that keeps the pain clinic in Guelph.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu victim had medical condition; Health officials monitoring 300 people who attended Alberta woman's funeral</b>
</div><div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>487 words</div><div>9 May 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>EDMONTON</p>
<p>Provincial health officials confirmed yesterday that H1N1 flu was a contributing factor in the death of a northern Alberta woman who had other chronic medical conditions.</p>
<p>It's the first death in Canada associated with the global H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau said the woman was in her 30s. He said her other medical conditions were originally blamed for her death on April 28. But health officials went back and did tests after a relative contracted a mild form of the H1N1 flu illness on May 5.</p>
<p>Those tests came back positive for the virus.</p>
<p>"There is nothing that is really different for us from a public health perspective,'' Corriveau said, adding the patient only had a mild form of the flu and it is not known exactly what role it played in her death.</p>
<p>Dr. Gerry Predy, a senior medical officer of health, said more may be known about her case after the final pathology report is finished next week.</p>
<p>The woman had no history of travel to Mexico, where the outbreak began. It appears that she gave the virus to the relative who tested positive, but there is no way to tell for sure, officials said.</p>
<p>The 300 people who attended the woman's funeral are now being monitored for any signs of the illness.</p>
<p>Officials would not release exactly where the woman lived.</p>
<p>Corriveau said the woman's age is not a concern for health officials because she had other medical conditions, putting her at increased risk of serious consequences from the flu.</p>
<p>"It's something that happens usually in vulnerable people whatever age they might be at,'' he said. "I don't think the age is much relevant here. It's really the cluster of underlying conditions that would make somebody vulnerable.''</p>
<p>Corriveau noted that every year about 4,000 Canadians die of the flu and a high percentage of them have another condition that put them at increased risk.</p>
<p>A total of 44 people have died of the flu strain in Mexico and two in the U.S.</p>
<p>There are 243 confirmed cases of the outbreak strain of H1N1 in Canada. Alberta confirmed nine new cases yesterday, including the woman who died, for a total of 42. Ontario reported six new cases yesterday, bringing the total there to 62.</p>
<p>Quebec health officials said four new cases had been confirmed in that province yesterday, bringing the total there to 15.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia confirmed three more cases, bringing the total there to 56. British Columbia confirmed six new cases for a total of 60. Prince Edward Island confirmed one new case for a total of three. Nearly all of the cases in Canada have been mild.</p>
<p>Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as the three territories, haven't officially reported any cases.</p>

<p>With all the "brains" in the World Health Organization and our illustrious media "experts," could they not predict that by naming this flu the "swine flu" that it would cause even more hardship in the economy?</p>
<p>Why was it not given the H1N1 name in the first place and avoided all the unnecessary panic over what is edible? Even now, some media refer to it as the "former swine flu" -- what good is that?</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Ontario reported six new cases of the H1N1 flu yesterday, including the first laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus in Hamilton and at the health unit in Hastings and Prince Edward counties, bringing the provincial total to 62.</p>
<p>The other new incidents of the virus were in communities that had previously reported cases -- Toronto with three and York with one.</p>
<p>All of the cases were mild, said Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"There are no hospitalizations,'' Williams said at the province's daily update on the flu.</p>
<p>"The numbers will continue to go up over the next few days as we finish off our laboratory testing.''</p>
<p>Ontario's public health officials also said they would no longer hold daily briefings on H1N1 flu unless there is a major development, and would soon stop reporting the individual number of new cases, as U.S. health officials plan to do.</p>
<p>Williams said the number of Ontario cases being sent to the lab for testing had dropped sharply from a high of up to 700 a day down to 270 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>More than 70 per cent of the tests sent to the labs come back as seasonal flu, which usually ends in April but is likely showing up more now because people with even minor symptoms are more likely to be tested because of the worries over H1N1 flu, Williams said.</p>
<p>Ontario reports an average of 9,000 cases of seasonal flu each year, and about 500 deaths.</p>
<p>Health officials also said there is no need for parents to worry about H1N1 flu being spread in schools, even though some students have been confirmed as having the virus.</p>
<p>"We haven't seen any sustained transmission within school settings,'' said Dr. Vivek Goel, chief executive of Ontario's Agency for Health Protection and Promotion.</p>
<p>"There's really not anything for parents to worry about compared to what they'd be worried about in the regular flu season.''</p>
<p>Williams said there had been no reports of any secondary spread in Ontario schools.</p>

<p>The morning after his Yankees dropped yet another game to the hated Red Sox, Nick Swisher said there was no quit in his team and vowed to get the Bostonians that night.</p>
<p>He did so using Twitter, of course, and the 62,767 people following him surely felt better because of it.</p>
<p>Then Swisher went out Tuesday and struck out twice as the Yankees lost yet again. This time there was no tweet.</p>
<p>I could have tweeted him back to find out why, but my guess is he would be as uninterested in the mundane things I would pack into 140 characters as I am with what he has to say. That is, of course, unless he calls his shot from the dugout just before going out and facing Jonathan Papelbon.</p>
<p>Among athletes, we can grant an exemption to Shaq on this one because the big guy, also known as The--Real--Shaq, is undoubtedly the most creative Twitterer around.</p>
<p>He does things such as tweet his presence at a store and promise game tickets to the first person who touches him, which is one reason why he has 906,908 followers.</p>
<p>"I perform random acts of Shaqness," he proclaims.</p>
<p>Good for him.</p>
<p>But do we really need Shaq telling us, as he did Wednesday, that he's predicting Kobe against LeBron in the NBA finals? I mean, doesn't everyone know that already?</p>
<p>And who really wants to get a tweet from him promoting his new diet product? No doubt, though, that it's a Twitter world we live in.</p>
<p>The New York Jets announced they landed Mark Sanchez via Twitter, John Calipari uses it regularly in hopes it will lead him to a recruit who will justify his $32 million US contract, and San Francisco Giants closer Brian Wilson had to quit using it after questions were raised about his tweets from a late night out.</p>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, I plead guilty to sending out a tweet the other day promoting my new book. The basic idea is sound, unfiltered information straight from the source, all in 140 characters or less.</p>
<p>That's how I learned golfer Morgan Pressel likes to shop and seems to eat an awful lot, and that CC Sabathia was glad to be home last week after returning from a road trip.</p>
<p>And where else could we get updates from Jose Canseco on his latest charade -- a mixed martial arts bout against 7-foot-2 Hong Man Choi in Tokyo.</p>
<p>"Training hard....ready to shock everyone on May 26th. Are you ready??!!" Canseco wrote.</p>
<p>The problem with most tweets is they leave us wanting more.</p>
<p>Take John Daly's recent postings. Here's a guy who must have a million sordid stories to tell, yet two of his last three posts involved him eating breakfast and then going to play golf.</p>
<p>Granted, the third was a swine flu joke that featured Kermit the Frog and a pig that apparently had Daly rolling on the floor in laughter. Apparently, bad humour can be done in 140 characters or less.</p>
<p>So can good food, which seems to be a big topic among Twittering athletes.</p>
<p>On Wednesday swimmer Dara Torres had a healthy salad and not so healthy onion rings for lunch, while former UConn centre Hasheem Thabeet was Twittering about the seafood he had the night before at Crustacean in Beverly Hills.</p>
<p>How about throwing us a real piece of red meat?</p>
<p>I can't find any evidence Yankee pitcher Joba Chamberlain is tweeting, but think of what he could say about the arrest of his mother on drug charges or Joe Giradi's decision to yank him Tuesday night in the middle of an inning after he had just struck out his eighth batter in a row.</p>
<p>Teammate Alex Rodriguez could send a tweet to his followers asking them not to believe everything they read, while managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner could post one offering half-priced tickets behind home plate to the first 1,000 lucky followers.</p>
<p>Tiger Woods never says anything to the media that might even remotely be controversial, but imagine if he were tweeting after the final round of the Masters.</p>
<p>Actually, there's not much to imagine because it would be unprintable.</p>
<p>And how about Michael Vick giving us the inside scoop from Leavenworth. He could tweet about the food and how excited he was to have Tony Dungy visit the other day until he found out that Dungy didn't coach the Indianapolis Colts anymore.</p>

<p>A young Hamiltonian is ill with swine flu.</p>
<p>Hamilton's first case of H1N1 influenza A is mild and the person is recovering at home.</p>
<p>The Hamiltonian, described only as a "younger individual," recently visited Mexico. The person is not a student or a health-care worker.</p>
<p>"This is what we expected to have happen, that Hamilton would get a case," said medical officer of health Dr. Elizabeth Richardson.</p>
<p>Public health is getting in touch with anyone who had close contact with the ill person here.</p>
<p>"We're trying to understand how infectious it is, how easily it's transmitted and how severe the disease is," said Richardson.</p>
<p>The Hamiltonian was one of six new cases in Ontario yesterday, bringing the total number of ill to 62. There are 243 people with swine flu across Canada.</p>
<p>There are no new cases in Halton, which has two students sick with H1N1. One is a teen who attends Christ the King Catholic School in Georgetown.</p>
<p>The other is an elementary grade student at Lorne Skuce Public School in Oakville.</p>
<p>For the first time, a Canadian with swine flu has died. H1N1 was a contributing factor in the death of an Alberta woman in her 30s who had other chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>Richardson said the best way to protect against H1N1 flu is to wash your hands frequently.</p>
<p>She urged anyone with symptoms to stay home unless they're severely ill. "Don't go to school, don't go to work and don't go to a health-care facility," she said.</p>
<p>The public health's flu hotline is 905-546-2424, ext. 7970 and operates from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Friday.</p>

</p>
<p>EDMONTON, CALGARY -- Two weeks ago today, Tina L'Hirondelle was having trouble breathing and drove herself to a hospital in High Prairie, a mill town in northern Alberta.</p>
<p>She never left – the 39-year-old woman, who had a history of asthma and diabetes, died on April 28.</p>
<p>However, it took until yesterday for provincial health officials to confirm publicly that her death was Canada's first linked with influenza A/H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>They might never have made the connection. However, Ms. L'Hirondelle's mother, Mabel, was confirmed with a mild case of the illness on Tuesday, which prompted authorities to track down all of her recent contacts.</p>
<p>Neither woman has a prior connection to Mexico, which is where the virus originated, and medical investigators are still trying to figure out how they caught it and whether it caused Ms. L'Hirondelle's death.</p>
<p>“There were a number of pre-existing medical conditions that actually even at the time the physicians that were taking care of her didn't even think about flu as a possibility,” André Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, told reporters.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, tests on tissues taken during an autopsy of the woman confirmed the presence of the virus.</p>
<p>There have been 47 confirmed deaths around the world connected to swine flu.</p>
<p>Ms. L'Hirondelle hailed from Gift Lake, a remote Métis settlement about 450 kilometres northwest of Edmonton. However, in recent weeks, the single woman had been living with her mother at a motel in High Prairie while they searched for an apartment, according to the motel's manager who didn't want to be identified.</p>
<p>The province has flown nurses to Gift Lake to dispense treatment to those who need it and to provide advice to the community of 1,000 about the virulent flu.</p>
<p>Ms. L'Hirondelle's mother had attended a wake and funeral for her daughter in Gift Lake earlier this week. Hundreds of people attended both services.</p>
<p>Anybody who had contact with the deceased woman and who contracted the virus would likely have symptoms by now. Officials said they know of no new cases in the region.</p>
<p>Ken Shaw, a Gift Lake resident, attended Ms. L'Hirondelle's wake on May 3. He said when word spread around the community that her mother was diagnosed this week with swine flu, there “was a little bit of panic.” However, he said health officials have addressed those concerns.</p>
<p>Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services, said officials won't know until next week at the earliest if Ms. L'Hirondelle died from the virus or from complications from her existing chronic medical issues.</p>
<p>The number of confirmed cases of influenza A/H1N1 has risen to 242 in Canada, an increase of 28 since Thursday.</p>
<p>To date, there have been 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases of the flu strain in 25 countries, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Sylvie Briand, acting director of the global influenza program at the World Health Organization, said those who are falling seriously ill or dying of the virus are predominantly previously healthy young people who deteriorated rapidly and died of pneumonia and those with chronic underlying conditions such as diabetes, tuberculosis and cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Richard Besser, acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said scientists noted about one-third of those hospitalized with severe swine flu in the United States had asthma.</p>
<p>Health officials said people shouldn't let their guard down. The pandemic threat remains high.</p>
<p>Oscar Mujica, a senior analyst with the Pan-American Health Organization, said yesterday that the Draconian measures taken by the Mexican government to close businesses and schools have dramatically curtailed the spread of swine flu.</p>
<p>According to his analysis, the measures have prevented more than 8,000 deaths and 30,000 hospitalizations.</p>

<div>WEEKEND WORKOUT / Tavia Grant dissects the latest workplace and career trends</div>
<div>Report on Business: Globe Careers</div>
<div id="hd"><b>OFFICE DESIGNS; Changed seats lately? many companies are rethinking seating arrangements after layoffs or to save on real estate costs. Rearranging an office requires time, money - not to mention the effort to convince change-averse employees to embrace a new space. But there's growing evidence that smart designs can boost creativity and productivity, and cut absenteeism.</b>

</p>
<p>THREE TRENDS</p>
<p>GOING GREEN</p>
<p>Floor-to-ceiling windows drench the rooms in sunlight. A garden on the ground floor offers a spot to decompress. Office air is pumped upward to the ceiling instead of circulating, helping to cut contagious worker sneezes (a welcome feature given current swine flu fears). A white roof reflects sunlight, keeping the office cool in the summer. Harvested rainwater keeps the building's bathrooms running in case a water main breaks.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Toronto headquarters of business software provider SAS Canada, the first commercial building in Canada to receive the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification.</p>
<p>It came with a $30-million price tag. But the investment is paying off in lower absenteeism, higher productivity and energy cost savings, says Stuart Bowden, senior vice-president of finance and operations.</p>
<p>Two years after SAS made the 2006 move, absenteeism was down 35 per cent from levels in its previous quarters, a drop Mr. Bowden attributes mainly to better air quality helping to reduce sickness and also to increased sunlight improving moods and lowering stress levels. And he has heard anecdotally from staff that they feel their productivity has increased.</p>
<p>The company's annual energy bill, meantime, is 62 per cent cheaper than that of a typical Ontario office building. More natural light and the use of energy-efficient bulbs help explain why – there's now 50 per cent more light in the building even though it's using 30 per cent less energy in lighting.</p>
<p>SAS figures its investment in going green will pay off in about three years.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>LIFESPACES</p>
<p>An airy, open-concept bistro sits at the centre of MediaCom Canada's 46,000-square-foot Toronto office space, which the communications firm had redesigned two years ago to include a “community hub.”</p>
<p>“Instead of two people meeting in someone's office, they meet in a common area, and find that there is a natural inclusion of others that just happens from being in open space,” says chief executive officer Amanda Ploughman.</p>
<p>Staff use the space in different ways throughout the day, she says: in the morning for coffee, breakfast and sharing of news, over lunch for catching up with co-workers who they might not have regular contact with, in the afternoon for a town hall, and in the evening for social events.</p>
<p>“We're a young, vibrant company and this environment helps nurture that excitement,” Ms. Ploughman says.</p>
<p>It's part of a wider trend toward what Don Crichton calls “lifespaces” – versatile, comfortable and homey public spaces.</p>
<p>“We're seeing lifespaces being mimicked in workspaces now,” says Mr. Crichton, practice leader of workplace solutions at architecture firm <span class="companylink">HOK Canada</span>, who oversaw MediaCom's revamp. “So the airport lounge, the hotel lounges, the <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, those types of spaces people are comfortable meeting in, we're finding ourselves now creating them in traditional office settings.”</p>
<p>While it's hard to quantify the direct payoff, Ms. Ploughman believes the space has helped productivity by bringing together staff from different departments and promoting the exchange of ideas.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>CLOSE QUARTERS</p>
<p>Innovation is an obsession at the world's largest search engine. The best way to innovate is through collaboration – and that means sitting at close quarters, <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>. has found.</p>
<p>Engineers, for example, are typically clustered in small “pods” of three people. All other staff have similarly close desk designs, increasing the chance they will overhear what's happening in different projects and participate, says global benefits director Sue Wuthrich. (People wear earphones if they want alone time, she adds.)</p>
<p>Open-floor plans and a casual atmosphere also promote communication. “I just had a meeting the other day in somebody's pod. We ran out of chairs, so I grabbed one of the exercise balls that are spread across the offices. Someone else sat on the floor. It's a very casual environment,” she says.</p>
<p>The informal exchanges extend to lunch. <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s Mountain View, Calif.-based headquarters offers 21 cafeterias, with free lunches served between noon and 1:30 p.m. Co-workers go to lunch together and chat with other colleagues as they stand in line.</p>
<p>The interactions don't happen by accident: <span class="companylink">Google</span> has calculated the optimal time to interact in line, without it turning awkward. It's between three and five minutes.</p>

<p>OBSTACLES</p>
<p>Cost</p>
<p>Not everyone has millions of dollars these days to spend on an office overhaul. Long-term investments may prove difficult for companies focused by necessity on short-term cash flow.</p>
<p>Privacy</p>
<p>Many companies are trying to squish people into small spaces to save on costs. They may be overdoing it: Cramped employees may not be able to manoeuvre, may be distracted by noise and feel stressed as a result.</p>
<p>Time</p>
<p>Employees are already pressed for time these days. Embarking on an office rethink necessitates many hours spent tailoring a new design – and several managers to oversee it.</p>
<p>Change</p>
<p>Many people hate it. Sure, they may eventually come to love their new digs. But any redesign should involve the people affected – and seek their input along the way, design experts say.</p>
<p>No one-size-fits-all</p>
<p>Some tech firms are introducing “non-territorial” arrangements, which have no seating plans. That loose approach might help people mingle, but can prove challenging for, say, lawyers, who need to keep files in order and cases confidential. Let staff, and the culture of the workplace, drive any changes, designers say.</p>

<p>Renowned Canadian photographer Russell Monk has a home near Mexico City and last weekend decided to take a break from building a playground for barrio children (hollywilmeth.typepad.com/montesplayground) to see for himself – on foot – how the place was coping with the great swine-flu scare.</p>
<p>He sends this report:</p>
<p>I started at the Basilica de la Guadalupe, determined to go as far south as I could walk in two days.</p>
<p>The city was in virtual shutdown mode – schools had been closed, public gatherings banned, restaurants allowed to offer takeout service only. At the basilica, a small outdoor service was under way. The priests wore masks.</p>
<p>The streets, normally more clogged than almost anywhere else, were eerily bereft of traffic. A few people wandered along the sidewalks. Most weren't wearing masks, and neither was I, although there was one in my backpack.</p>
<p>In the Zocalo, the biggest public square on the planet, a huge white, makeshift building had gone up. It looked like a temporary hospital ready for the infected hordes. In fact, it's to house an upcoming dinosaur exhibit. The square was nearly empty. A huge Mexican flag flying at half-mast fluttered limply in the breeze. Across the street, <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> was letting customers come in no more than four at a time.</p>
<p>Nearby, Plaza Garibaldi is “mariachi central,” and hundreds of itinerant musicians were lounging around, smoking and chatting. There were no clients to listen to their songs. A few wore masks, which looked incongruous alongside their flashy costumes.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, I started out early, walking through the downtown's Alameda Central, a former Aztec marketplace that has been a public park since 1592. It was deserted, save for a few people sleeping on benches and some dishevelled middle-aged men studiously reading papers and looking like down-and-out intellectuals from another era.</p>
<p>The three policemen in this photograph patrolled the park on horseback wearing traditional sombreros. I stopped and chatted for a few minutes about the flu crisis. It was a little difficult to understand their Spanish through their masks. But they were friendly and upbeat – and I could see their smiles in their eyes.</p>

<p>Re: Don't Eat Pork from Infected Animals: WHO, May 7,</p>
<p>Scientists around the world agree that pork is safe. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organization for Animal Health are clear that the H1N1 virus does not affect the safety of properly handled and cooked pork. This is the same message we give to consumers any time raw meat is involved. Good food safety practices, including proper cooking, need to be followed to prevent a range of potential food-related concerns.</p>
<p>The WHO stated yesterday that it is important to make sure that pork comes from healthy hogs. We absolutely agree. That is why Canada's system ensures only healthy hogs enter the food supply.</p>
<p>To reiterate, H1N1 is not a food safety concern.</p>

<p>New cases of the swine flu continue to be found among British Columbians, with six additional cases announced yesterday in Metro Vancouver.</p>
<p>Five of the new cases are in the Fraser Health region, one in Vancouver Coastal Health. Sixty people across the province have the strain.</p>
<p>All of those who have tested positive for the H1N1 swine flu virus in B.C. are either recovering or fully recovered. There have been no deaths in this province.</p>
<p>Decker Lake elementary, near Burns Lake, will stay closed until further notice after a few of the students there tested positive for the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Students at Beairsto elementary in Vernon will return to classes Monday after the school closed April 30 when a student tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Public Health Agency of Canada reported 28 new cases of swine flu, bringing Canada's total to 242. In addition to the new B.C. cases, one new case was confirmed in Prince Edward Island, three in Nova Scotia, four in Quebec, five in Ontario and nine in Alberta.</p>
<p>The death of a northern Alberta woman last week is Canada's first associated with swine flu, but no one knows if H1N1 killed her, officials said yesterday. The woman, who was in her 30s and had chronic health problems, died April 28. Doctors didn't suspect the flu virus, but on May 5, when one of her relatives, who lived with the woman, was found to have a mild form of the disease caused by the H1N1 virus, the province took a closer look.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, despite being inundated with dire warnings about a flu pandemic, Canadians should know the country is in good shape to tackle an outbreak should it happen, says the head of the Canadian Medical Association.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Ouellet says, "Canadians should be reassured that everything will be done" in the event of a worldwide influenza pandemic, including moving doctors between provinces or bringing retired health workers back into the system.</p>
<p>"We are much more prepared than we were" during the SARS outbreak of 2003 that killed 44 Canadians, Ouellet said.</p>
<p>"We didn't have [testing] kits. ... Now we have vaccines, we have kits that are prepared and we have literature and communication that are available and we have a new public health agency of Canada. So this is a big difference.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>When coverage goes viral</b>
</div><div>835 words</div><div>9 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>IN06</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Media coverage of swine flu or H1N1, as the World Health Organization now refers to it, went viral quicker than the flu itself.</p>
<p>As one U.S. pundit put it: "If as many people had swine flu as those that are covering it, then it would be a pandemic to reckon with."</p>
<p>Did the worldwide media overreact and sensationalize the global threat of a potentially deadly strain of flu that originated in Mexico and virtually shut down part of that country last month?</p>
<p>In covering the possible unfolding of a global pandemic, there's a fine balance to be struck in informing readers and provoking fear. With the benefit of knowing that, for now, this latest flu outbreak has been seemingly contained with a little more than 200 Canadian cases, it's now worth questioning whether the media's zeal for a prospective pandemic has been overly infectious.</p>
<p>Indisputably, this flu outbreak is a vitally important news story that matters worldwide. When the authoritative WHO raises its global alert for swine flu to its second-highest level, saying it believes pandemic is imminent - as the Star reported nearly two weeks ago - that's front-page news by anyone's definition.</p>
<p>With memories of SARS still fresh - severe acute respiratory syndrome killed 44 people in Toronto in 2003 - Toronto Star readers certainly needed to know whether any significant flu outbreak might mark the beginning of the next global epidemic that public health experts have long anticipated and worried about.</p>
<p>Throughout the last week of April, news of this flu dominated the Star, as it did media throughout North America and much of the world. According to the Project for Excellence in Journalism's (PEJ) weekly news coverage index, nearly one-third of the space and time in major U.S. media last week was focused on swine flu and the threat of a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Flu coverage was most dominant on television, filling 43 per cent of the airtime of the broadcast network news programs and half of the morning news shows' time. Bloggers and social media also caught this flu bug. According to the PEJ report, a third of the links by blogs and social media sites from April 27 to May 1 focused on swine flu.</p>
<p>The report concluded that the most distinguishing characteristic of this coverage was "the near breathtaking speed in which the media accelerated from zero to 60 miles per hour on a story that materialized out of the blue."</p>
<p>Swine flu and the possibility of pandemic so dominated the news cycle that by May 1 a backlash against "perceived press excess" began. The question then became whether the intensity of the media coverage stoked public anxiety levels. The blogosphere especially focused on whether the issue was being overblown.</p>
<p>What about the Star? Did this news organization overreact and sensationalize the threat of swine flu and possible pandemic?</p>
<p>Considering Toronto's previous close encounter with SARS, heightened interest among Star readers could be expected. This story merited strong coverage in the Star.</p>
<p>Overall, I think the Star struck the right balance in providing authoritative, essential information, advising vigilance and cautioning against overreaction. As one letter writer wrote: The Star "refrained from the pull-your-hair-out-and-run-screaming reportage."</p>
<p>I say this as a reader with a personal interest in this story. My sister, who owns property in Mexico, has recently been quite sick with a lingering upper respiratory illness. Given that she visited Mexico in March, her doctor last week had her tested for swine flu.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the test was negative. But, as I awaited this family news, I've paid close, careful attention to this global news story.</p>
<p>The Star's extensive coverage provided me with needed perspective and practical information. Several times, complex, necessary information about this flu - its symptoms, how it spreads and other essential facts - was presented in a reader-friendly Q&A format that directly answered my own questions and helped quell fear.</p>
<p>An April 28 editorial, "Prudent response over swine flu" made the case to remain calm but not complacent. Health reporter Joseph Hall's April 30 report on interviews with some of Ontario's most authoritative communicable illness experts told readers that while it was too early to gauge the seriousness of this bout of flu, good reason existed to count on "the more benign outcome."</p>
<p>Thoughtful columns by Thomas Walkom called for perspective, not panic: "Yes, there is a potentially deadly strain of swine flu spreading around the globe. No, it's not necessarily the end of the world," Walkom wrote. That column provided readers with important context about the relatively low numbers of people worldwide affected by this flu and the larger number stricken by influenza every year.</p>
<p>"Global crisis? Hogwash," read the Star's Page 1 throw to Walkom's May 2 column.</p>
<p>For now, it seems, that's the good news for all of us.</p>

<p>Alberta</p>
<p>Swine flu confirmed</p>
<p>as factor in death</p>
<p>Health officials have confirmed that swine flu contributed to the death of a northern Alberta woman - the first person in Canada to die after contracting the illness.</p>
<p>The woman, in her 30s, had other chronic health conditions that were originally blamed for her death on April 28, officials said.</p>
<p>But when an older relative developed mild flu-like symptoms and tested positive for the H1N1 virus, officials went back and looked at the case of the dead woman. Tissue samples confirmed she had a mild case of swine flu when she died.</p>

<p>Inquest told van wasn't</p>
<p>inspected often enough</p>
<p>New Brunswick's registrar of motor vehicles says a van involved in a deadly crash last year was given the proper vehicle inspection, but it didn't happen often enough.</p>
<p>Charles O'Donnell told an inquest yesterday the 15-passenger van should have been looked at every six months, rather than the once-per-year inspection it received. Seven members of the Bathurst High School boys' basketball team and their coach's wife were killed Jan. 12, 2008 when the van veered into the path of a truck.</p>

<p>Illness puts Hawking's</p>
<p>Waterloo visit on hold</p>
<p>Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking has put a summer visit to Waterloo's Perimeter Institute on hold as he recovers from illness.</p>
<p>Hawking, 67, was taken to hospital in England last month for tests after a respiratory infection. He suffers from neuromuscular dystrophy related to ALS, which has left him almost completely paralyzed. Last November, Hawking accepted a research post with the Perimeter Institute.</p>

</p>
<p>Command central for the management of swine flu in Ontario is a nondescript office building in downtown Toronto.</p>
<p>This is the Ministry of Health's Emergency Operation Centre where provincial officials are directing health-care providers across Ontario on the response to the H1N1 virus. The location of this swine flu war room is kept secret for security reasons, but the Star was allowed inside yesterday for a behind-the-scenes look.</p>
<p>About 15 people work here and are in constant contact with hundreds of health-care providers. This is the other end of the emergency hotline that practitioners call for the latest information on how to contain the bug. It is where six teleconferences are staged daily with hospitals, long-term care homes, public health units, provincial labs, federal and provincial governments, other ministries and the list goes on.</p>
<p>It is where epidemiologists funnel information about the travel of the bug and where experts from the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion send information about its behaviour. And it is where officials consider strategies in the event the outbreak, which has so far been mild, takes a turn for the worse by mutating, making people sicker or spreading faster.</p>
<p>"There are hundreds of people behind us putting in long hours and doing that work," says Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>While officials are conveying an image of orderly calm to the public, they are on high alert behind closed doors. They don't want the public to panic, but they have to remain vigilant, lest the World Health Organization declares the virus has spread to pandemic levels, moving up to level 6 from 5 on the pandemic alert scale.</p>
<p>"We have to be prepared to turn on a dime," says Phil Graham, interim director of the ministry's emergency management unit. "Emergencies can be unpredictable."</p>
<p>The day's troubleshooting starts at 8: 30 a.m. with a teleconference involving 35 representatives of health-care organizations.</p>
<p>A representative of the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions wants to know if Princess Margaret Hospital is ramping up protection of its staff after a worker there tested positive for the virus. Dr. Brian Schwartz, scientific consultant to the unit, assures the caller "current protections are more than adequate to protect the employees."</p>
<p>Maps of the province are tacked to the walls. In a corner cubicle, with the sign "Logistics" overhead, officials work the phones to ensure hospitals and other facilities have a four-week supply of medical equipment. The ministry has another four-week supply. It also has a stockpile of antiviral medication at another secret location, enough for a quarter of Ontario's population.</p>
<p>A sophisticated computer program allows officials to track the spread of the virus and pinpoint clusters. It is a big change from the 2003 SARS outbreak when cases were tracked using sticky notes.</p>
<p>"We've come a long way since SARS. This unit was created as a result of SARS," Graham explains.</p>
<p>A public inquiry into SARS revealed better communication was needed in the health sector in the event of another outbreak. The Emergency Operations Centre is the main communication link for information on swine flu. This is where incoming information is assimilated and outgoing directives are made. There is much talk of "messaging" and there are two major daily deadlines for delivering them: 3 p.m. when Williams holds a news conference and midnight when an update is emailed to some 36,000 health-care providers.</p>
<p>Yesterday, six more cases were added to Ontario's swine flu tally for a total of 62, all of them mild, including one at North Toronto Collegiate. They represent only 30 per cent of all cases that have tested positive for influenza A. The vast majority are "non-swine" strains.</p>
<p>Williams' message yesterday was that it is too early for Ontario to let its guard down.</p>
<p>"As we go forward the tendency might be to say things are cooling off, just turn the switch off. That will not occur," he says.</p>

<p>Bandit brings together</p>
<p>police union rivals</p>
<p>When outgoing police association boss Dave Wilson had his laptop, badge and wallet stolen out of his car Thursday night, arch union rival Const. Mike McCormack was among the team who recovered the goods.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, McCormack announced he would be vying for the president's job this fall, just hours after Wilson announced his resignation.</p>
<p>Wilson narrowly defeated McCormack in 2006.</p>
<p>"For me, the really interesting piece of the story is the bandit left his jacket and probation papers inside the car," Wilson said.</p>

<p>Councillor Adam Giambrone, chair of the <span class="companylink">Toronto Transit Commission</span>, has apologized after another councillor said he was worried his residents would suffer "reprisals by the TTC" because of a political feud.</p>
<p>Giambrone had sent an email to Councillor Cesar Palacio on Thursday that read:</p>
<p>"Stop messing in my ward or there will be problems. I generally ignore your actions, but I am going to start looking for ways to cause trouble for you and when I start you're not going to appreciate it."</p>
<p>Palacio complained to integrity commissioner Lorne Sossin.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Going over (and back) about to get tougher; Ontario tourism officials fear decline in visits over new passport rules</b>
</div><div>Chris Sorensen   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>663 words</div><div>9 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>T09</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Popping across the border to the United States for a weekend getaway this summer may require a little more advance planning than Canadians have been accustomed to.</p>
<p>Beginning June 1, all Canadians over 19 visiting the United States will be required to show a passport or other government-approved document with "enhanced" security if they want to drive across the border.</p>
<p>Children 18 and under will need to present a birth certificate, naturalization certificate or a passport.</p>
<p>The new rules are the latest phase of the U.S. government's Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative.</p>
<p>Another option for Ontario motorists is an enhanced security driver's licence, although it's not clear whether they will be ready in time for the June 1 deadline. The total cost of the enhanced driver's licence is $115 - $40 on top of the standard renewal fee of $75 - and is more than the $87 fee for an adult passport.</p>
<p>While the rule changes will no doubt send a flood of Canadians running to the passport office with last-minute applications, a bigger concern is the impact of the new requirements on the Canadian tourism industry.</p>
<p>That's because Americans who visit Canada will be required to present passports at the border in order to return home to the U.S.</p>
<p>The catch? Only about an estimated 30 per cent of Americans own passports.</p>
<p>"The real concern is middle America, where they jump in the car with their families and have their getaways. They don't have passports," said Patrick Gedge, chief executive of Niagara Economic Development Corp. and Tourism Niagara.</p>
<p>"Over the past few years, we've seen decreases in rubber tire traffic from the U.S. because they've perceived that they needed a passport. So we've even been hurt by the perception of it."</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the ongoing economic recession in the U.S. promises to keep more Americans from taking vacations this summer, while the recent outbreak of swine flu centred in Mexico could also put the brakes on some discretionary travel.</p>
<p>"I'm getting tired of the phrase 'Perfect Storm'," said Gedge. "Because it seems like we've been having one every year for the past few years."</p>
<p>In response, tourism officials in Ontario are hoping to offset an expected decline in U.S. tourists by convincing more Ontarians to "play in their own backyard" this summer.</p>
<p>"We know the American market is a little bit soft this year for us, so we're turning our focus a little more to Ontario travellers," said Monique Smith, the province's tourism minister, in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Smith said the province is also focusing on educating Americans about the new passport rules at land borders, the implementation of which has already been delayed twice.</p>
<p>"We've worked hard with American representatives to find an alternative to the passport ... and that will help," she said. "And our hard work paid off in delaying the requirements by a year."</p>
<p>There is also widespread concern in Canada and U.S. border states that the new measures will lead to chaos at busy border crossings as motorists show up with insufficient documentation, further threatening the flow of traffic and trade over the world's longest undefended border.</p>
<p>U.S. President Barack Obama's administration said in March that it would oppose U.S. legislation that proposed yet another year-long delay of the requirement.</p>
<p>Janet Napolitano, the new U.S. Homeland Security secretary, has said the administration feels the need for a degree of "parity" when it comes to security measures along the U.S. border with Mexico, and the border with Canada.</p>

<p>The baseball world was rocked Thursday when Los Angeles Dodgers flake Manny Ramirez was suspended for 50 games for violating MLB's drug policy. Reports indicate Ramirez tested positive for human chorionic gonadotropin, a female fertility drug. Baseball officials obviously didn't believe Ramirez when he claimed HCG was a naturally occurring substance on his planet ... What did Ramirez use to inject himself? Why, the ManRam, of course ... The Dodgers based part of their spring marketing campaign on Ramirez, which didn't impress the executive director of the USC Sports Business Institute. As David Carter told the Los Angeles Times: "You can't put all your eggs in one basket and let a guy like Ramirez hold the basket."</p>
<p>Talk-show host Regis Philbin threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the Florida Marlins played host to the Cincinnati Reds on Monday. Noted Late Show host David Letterman: "After the game, Regis tested positive for Poly-grip." . . . The Tonight Show's Jay Leno heard about a new book that will discuss some of the famous people with whom New York Yankees great Joe DiMaggio had flings. Added Leno: "The book claims that he slept with some of the most famous women of the 1950s, including Madonna."... Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Joe Nelson has a split-finger pitch he calls the "Vulcan changeup." Nelson holds the ball between his middle and ring fingers, so his right hand resembles those of Vulcans as they greet each other on Star Trek. "(The name for the pitch) was either going to be Nanu Nanu from Mork & Mindy or the Vulcan," Nelson told the St. Petersburg Times. "And Spock just seemed like a cooler character than Mork did."</p>
<p>At a media event Friday, Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross and singer Jimmy Buffett announced the NFL team's home will be known as LandShark Stadium -- named after the LandShark Lager business in which Buffett has an interest. LandShark? Does that mean all of Miami's games will be televised on Saturday night, live? ... With a beer involved, each Dolphins game will feature a "Pint, Pass and Kick" competition ... According to <span class="companylink">Yahoo! </span>Sports, quarterback Brett Favre called Minnesota Vikings head coach Brad Childress and told the coach he wants to stay retired. Quick, somebody disconnect the redial function on Favre's phone!</p>
<p>This week's wacky soccer story comes from Mexico City, where Chivas defender Hector Reynoso was banned from the Copa Libertadores tournament after he pretended to cough and spit in the face of Everton's Sebastian Penco -- as if Reynoso was threatening to spread the swine flu. The man's a pig ... Golf Digest asked folks to submit a six-word essay on why they should be able to golf at Bethpage Black right before the U.S. Open with NBA legend Michael Jordan, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and singer Justin Timberlake. The winner from among more than 73,000 entries was Larry Giebelhausen, a Phoenix police lieutenant who wrote: "I'm a cop. I'll shoot low."</p>
<p>Lisa Hillary -- a former TSN and The Score reporter who now works for <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> Sportsnet in Washington -- was doing a live hit at the end of the Washington Capitals-Pittsburgh Penguins game Monday when she started freaking out. "Oh my God, a great big rat just came by," she squealed to studio host Chick Hernandez. Replied Hernandez: "I thought Sean Avery had left the building." ... Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen was asked by MLB.com who makes better athletes, baseball players or hockey players? "You won't see any fat boys in hockey," he said. "And in hockey, you want to fight, let's go fight. You get a two-minute (sic) penalty. In baseball, you get a 10-day suspension." ... The last word this week goes to Vancouver Canucks defenceman Sami Salo, who played coy when asked if the lower-body injury he has is an ankle, knee or groin problem. Replied Salo: "That's close. Or maybe it's just a burning sensation when you pee. You never know."</p>

<p>With fears that a new flu strain could become a pandemic, Beardy's and Okemasis is one community that didn't waste time developing preparedness plans.</p>
<p>Except the First Nation didn't start planning upon the recent discovery of influenza A H1N1. The band has been fine-tuning its pandemic plan for about five years, ever since the arrival of an information package from the federal government advising communities to be ready, said band councillor Jaye Cameron.</p>
<p>"We went full tilt," recalled Cameron. "We just said, 'OK if this hits tomorrow, if this hits next month, if this hits in a year's time, whatever it may be, we want to be prepared.'"</p>
<p>Cameron said she's glad the community did the legwork long ago, with a new flu strain now cropping up in Canada and elsewhere. Although the virus -- dubbed swine flu -- has mostly caused only mild illness, the World Health Organization's decision last week to increase its six-level pandemic alert level to five moved the Beardy's and Okemasis pandemic planning committee into full swing, just in case, she said.</p>
<p>Cameron acknowledged that all the planning has unnerved some residents of the reserve northeast of Saskatoon.</p>
<p>The plan, if a full-scale pandemic were ever to be declared, includes setting up roadblocks to curtail travel on and off the First Nation. The band would also cancel all community events.</p>
<p>But Cameron said she would rather have some community members upset and asking questions now, rather than unprepared when or if a pandemic ever hits.</p>
<p>She also said people who live off-reserve in urban areas -- roughly half the band members -- would still be able to come home.</p>
<p>"They are our people and they are our responsibility," said Cameron, who noted the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations recently asked if it could share the band's plan with some other First Nations that had called.</p>
<p>However, even if the current H1N1 outbreak is officially declared a pandemic by the WHO, that speaks to how the illness is spreading and not necessarily to its severity, Saskatchewan's top doctor Dr. Moira McKinnon noted Thursday when she confirmed the province had recorded its first two positive cases.</p>
<p>"We may see an announcement of a pandemic ... but some of the actions that would be needed to curb a severe pandemic won't happen," she said.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan Health's message to residents has been to carry on as normal, while remembering infection control practices such as proper hand-washing. McKinnon said health experts continue to monitor the virus to see if it changes.</p>

<p>For those who have followed the swine-flu outbreak, it has almost become a daily ritual, as routine as the morning weather forecast.</p>
<p>Each day, at roughly 11 a.m. eastern time, a senior official from the World Health Organization, often speaking in a dry, matter-of-fact tone, has appeared on TV screens to update the world on the outbreak.</p>
<p>But as fears of a catastrophic pandemic wane, some medical experts are questioning the apocalyptic statements that have occasionally emerged from WHO's otherwise subdued press conferences.</p>
<p>"Sometimes some of us think WHO stands for the `World Hysteria Organization,"' said Dr. Richard Schabas, who was Ontario's chief medical officer of health from 1987 to 1997. "There seems to be a culture at WHO where they've convinced themselves that a pandemic is such an imminent danger that they overreact."</p>
<p>Perhaps the most sensational statement by WHO came on April 29, the day the UN agency raised its six-point pandemic alert to phase five, meaning it believes a global pandemic is "imminent." Calling on all countries to "immediately activate their pandemic preparedness plans," WHO director-general Margaret Chan reminded the world: "it really is all of humanity that is under threat during a pandemic."</p>
<p>Chan qualified her remarks by noting the world is better prepared than ever before to fight a pandemic, and the agency was still gathering data to determine the potential severity of a swine-flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, her "threat-to-humanity" quote hit the 24-hour news cycle with all the subtlety of a neutron bomb -- triggering ominous headlines in newspapers and newscasts around the world.</p>
<p>This week, WHO officials appeared to tone down their rhetoric in the face of mounting evidence the outbreak might be milder than originally thought. As of Friday, 44 deaths had been confirmed in Mexico, less than one-third the number of deaths suspected last week. Most cases elsewhere in the world have caused symptoms consistent with the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Chan has defended her statements, saying it's her job to cautious.</p>
<p>"I'm not predicting the pandemic will blow up, but if I miss it and we don't prepare, I fail. I'd rather over-prepare than not prepare," she told the Financial Times.</p>
<p>WHO was founded in 1948, three years after the creation of the United Nations. It is considered the successor to the world health organization set up under the League of Nations in 1920, in the wake of the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak, which killed as many as 50 million people worldwide.</p>
<p>WHO represents 193 member states, who send delegates to a World Health Assembly that meets each year to set the agency's direction.</p>

</p>
<p>So I'm thinking two pounds ought to do it, although that's not much of a weekend brunch. Let's throw in a third slab, and still without guilt, insofar as federal authorities now say -- insist, actually -- that bacon is perfectly safe to eat.</p>
<p>Not that I've ever made it a practice to let government tell me what and what not to digest. But I do so love my bacon. Years of public health officials wagging fingers and tsk-tsking the bacon-based diet had caused me to second-guess the staple, eventually to the point, otherwise rare, of self-restraint. Since government's recent about-face on its bacon policy -- its official okey-dokey for all tasty pork products, in fact -- I feel I owe it myself to do some serious chewing and swallowing.</p>
<p>Pork up, pig out, whole hog. Oh, yeah, baby. Game on.</p>
<p>And don't think I can't hear you above the frying pan's sizzle.</p>
<p>You're saying, OK, so now that we know who put the R-O-N in M-O-R-O-N, tell us, Ron, what does the M-O stand for?</p>
<p>I shall tell you:</p>
<p>Mo' bacon.</p>
<p>And now you're saying it's a sad day indeed when the R-O-N doesn't even read his own newspaper. Otherwise he would know the government's assurance of pork's safety was intended to halt misconceptions of the meat as a carrier of swine 'flu. Lest there be any further confusion, swine flu is now known, officially, as the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Allow me to respond in succinct point form:</p>
<p>1) I don't care. I like bacon.</p>
<p>B) What you just told me, with all due respect, is quite possibly the silliest accurate account of the actual facts I have ever read in the newspaper, even if I was the one who wrote it.</p>
<p>For starters, nobody eats "swine." At the supermarket you can purchase a pork sirloin roast and in any of your swankier French restaurants order up such rich hog-based delicacies as le chops de porc avec fromage-au-whiz. Try asking that meat manager to cut, or requesting that waiter to bring, or inviting that wealthy client and his wife over to your house to dine on, "wads of swine," and see where your clever wordplay gets you.</p>
<p>Humans eat pork, not swine, and beef, not cows. A few years ago when mad cow disease was all the whoop-dee-do, did you see any mass panic, any worldwide paranoia, of beef products?</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, you did. But not here, not in Saskatchewan. We understood there was no connection between an isolated disease of cattle herds and the hamburger on our plates. We tucked into the beef like never before, knowing that the meat was safe, sensing that cattle ranchers needed our support in their worst financial crisis ever, and, most of all, thinking: hey, cheap T-bones!</p>
<p>Besides which, mad cows were indistinguishable, emotionally, from any other cows, as illustrated by the following bovine emoticons:</p>
<p>Happy cow ]:o</p>
<p>Mad cow ]:o</p>
<p>Melancholic cow ]:o</p>
<p>Don't even get me started on my seventh point today, which is chicken pox. Oddly enough, given the cow-beef and pig-pork deals, people actually do eat chicken, the animal, way more often the end product of same, poultry. No way could you be more food-specific than to name an ailment "chicken pox," a disease that is beyond pandemic, beyond epidemic and firmly established as boolagademic.</p>
<p>Every single adult I know has suffered chicken pox, and there's not a kid under 10 who will escape the itchy-scratchies. But do you see those 5-o'clock lineups at KFC getting any shorter? No, you do not.</p>
<p>Point D, sub-point VII: avian flu. Dead birds were the untouchables during the days of avian flu. Certainly no avian species back then was more lacking in get-up and go, more dead, than the turkey during the late afternoon of the second Monday in October, and the only personal health consideration I heard was: white meat or dark?</p>
<p>Returning now to my third and final point, let us address this "H1N1" business.</p>
<p>As if. Asked to rename an illness, wouldn't officialdom seize upon the obvious opportunity here, the chance to control through the power of widespread misrepresentation one of other everyday behaviours that always seem to drive government officials nuts, besides our eating bacon?

<p>Students at St. Joseph High School and their parents will have a chance to ask questions of public health officials Monday after it was revealed a student from that school has battled swine flu.</p>
<p>A letter went home Friday to all parents and caregivers of students in both Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools and Saskatoon Public Schools saying a teen girl who is a student at St. Joe's tested positive for swine flu after vacationing in Mexico.</p>
<p>"Our decision was that parents at the school needed to know," said Bev Hanson, director of education for the Catholic school division.</p>
<p>Along with a young woman in the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region, the case is one of the first two confirmed cases of swine flu in the province. A deputy medical health officer from Saskatoon Health Region said the teen had a mild case of the illness, did not require hospitalization and stayed at home while sick. She has since recovered.</p>
<p>Although just two cases have been confirmed in Saskatchewan since the outbreak was identified, Dr. Johnmark Opondo has said it's likely more people in the community have had the virus.</p>
<p>The letter says public health officials will be at St. Joe's on Monday from 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. to answer any questions from concerned parents or students. It also reminds parents to keep sick kids at home, and to teach them to wash their hands frequently and thoroughly, stay a few metres away from people who are coughing and to sneeze and cough into their elbows.</p>
<p>Although the school division initially said it did not know the girl's identity, or which school she attended, the family has since contacted the division, Hanson said.</p>
<p>In addition to sending home letters, teachers also talked to St. Joseph students Friday about the outbreak. Students were told to be respectful and not stigmatize anyone with swine flu, Hanson said.</p>
<p>"If any students are assuming that they know (who she is), that's an assumption only," Hanson said.</p>
<p>Another memo has also gone to all division principals and caretakers requesting they do extra cleaning in schools to help stop the spread of viruses.</p>
<p>One parent of a St. Joseph student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said she's not alarmed to learn a case of swine flu appeared in a teen at her son's school.</p>
<p>"I think that it's kind of been blown out of proportion," she said. "There's lots of flus going around."</p>
<p>It was bound to happen that someone in Saskatoon had travelled to Mexico and picked up the bug, the mother said, adding there was nothing the school division could have done to prevent it.</p>
<p>Her son, a Grade 11 student, said a teacher told his class Friday, "The only way you're going to get it is if you lick a desk."</p>
<p>"I don't think anyone's really too worried, actually," he said.</p>
<p>The mother predicts some parents will react by pulling their kids out of school.</p>
<p>"I just don't think everybody needs to be panicked or scared," she said.</p>

</div><div>FRANCOIS SHALOM   </div>

</p>
<p>The June target for deciding which route a rail shuttle linking Pierre Trudeau International Airport to downtown Montreal has again been pushed back, this time to the fall, said <span class="companylink">Aéroports de Montréal</span> chairman Pierre Martin yesterday.</p>
<p>"It's better to take a few extra weeks so that we address better the needs of (future) users and of citizens," said Martin after ADM's annual meeting. "That's just common sense."</p>
<p>Martin said there never was a firm date, but that the previous general target of June mentioned last month by Joël Gauthier, CEO of the Agence métropolitaine de transport, and James Cherry, president of ADM, was a bit optimistic, he noted.</p>
<p>The engineering work and other decisions on which route to take - the CN or CP route - will not be finalized until the fall, Martin said. The process is not a stand-alone decision, but is intertwined with a planned increase and upgrade of services on commuter train lines to the West Island in general, Cherry said.</p>
<p>The airport authority also reported passenger traffic fell 5.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year in the wake of the global economic crisis. International traffic actually rose by 3.9 per cent, while domestic and transborder volumes fell 11.8 per cent and 9.1 per cent respectively.</p>
<p>Cherry added the spread of H1N1 flu from Mexico "also will surely have an impact in April and May, but nothing huge."</p>
<p>Despite the "difficult context," ADM traffic dipped only 0.1 per cent last year, while revenues rose to $362.2 million from $320.7 million in 2007.</p>
<p>Freight traffic suffered a steep drop, but Cherry noted that was due "mainly to a new method of calculating cargo that is much more reliable."</p>

</p>
<p>One-third of the world's population - 2 billion people - would be infected if the human swine flu goes pandemic, World Health Organization officials said yesterday.</p>
<p>If the virus turns more virulent or becomes established in multiple countries outside North America, "if we do move into a pandemic, then our expectation is that we will see a large number of people infected worldwide," said WHO's acting director general, Dr. Keiji Fukuda.</p>
<p>Based on past pandemics, "it would be a reasonable estimate to say perhaps a third of the world's population would get infected with this virus," he said.</p>
<p>He said it is too soon to predict how many people would get seriously ill or die.</p>
<p>"We've said over and over again we are in this period where the spread of the virus is evolving, our understanding of the clinical spectrum is evolving, more information is being collected," Fukuda said in a conference call. "I think it is very premature to make those kinds of predictions."</p>
<p>But Fukuda said there is no evidence the virus is establishing the kind of community spread in other parts of the world as it has in North America. He said WHO's pandemic alert remains at five on a scale of six.</p>
<p>WHO raised its global total yesterday to 2,099 lab-confirmed cases of swine flu, including 44 deaths - 42 in Mexico and two in the U.S. Canada's public health agency confirmed 36 new cases across the country Wednesday, bringing Canada's total number of confirmed cases to 201.</p>
<p>Quebec confirmed one new case of swine flu yesterday, bringing the total to 11. Public health authorities said the new patient contracted the infection after travelling to Mexico. All cases are considered mild and none of those infected have been hospitalized, said Alain Poirier, director of Quebec's public health department.</p>
<p>In Calgary, health officials are testing a deceased patient from northern Alberta for swine flu, sources told Canwest News last night. Results from the tests were not yet available, but if the patient did have the influenza strain, it would be the first time someone with the disease has died in Canada. Media reports suggested the patient was an elderly woman.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON</p>
<p>The United States is in the midst of a devastating recession, mired in two wars and grappling with a H1N1 flu outbreak, but conservative critics are assailing President Barack Obama on another pressing issue: his choice of burger topping.</p>
<p>Dijongate is in full force, with Fox News and a conservative blogger leading the charge against Obama for his choice of the apparently un-American mustard atop his cheeseburger during a lunch stop this week with Vice-President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>There are even accusations of a coverup. MSNBC, apparently, edited out the mustard request to help Obama keep his "man of the people'' street cred. Fox's Sean Hannity tells viewers MSNBC is trying to hide Obama's Dijon-loving ways from the public. Hannity calls the president's lunch his "fancy burger.''</p>
<p>Blogger William Jacobson, a Cornell law professor, said the network "didn't mention one arugula-like fact'' about Obama's order at Ray's Hell Burger in Arlington, Va.</p>
<p>"MSNBC edited out the audio . . . just at the moment when Obama asked for Dijon mustard."</p>
<p>Dijon doesn't fit "the image being spun by the White House and MSNBC," Jacobson wrote. "Dijon mustard on a Hell Burger had a very John Kerry-ish quality about it.''</p>
<p>Jacobson blogged about other incidents in which Obama has revealed his weakness for the spicy French condiment. It's a key ingredient in Obama's favourite tuna salad, and he had the gall to request it during his first trip on Air Force One.</p>
<p>"And the mainstream media didn't cover it,'' Jacobson wrote.</p>
<p>Comedian Bill Maher, a libertarian, recently wrote that Conservatives are behaving like "the bitter divorced guy whose country has left him."</p>
<p>They're "obsessing over it, haranguing it, blubbering one minute about how much you love it and vowing the next that if you cannot have it, nobody will," Maher wrote.</p>
<p>"But . . . your country is not coming back to you. She's found somebody new. And it's a black guy.''</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Are there roughly 200 H1N1 flu cases in Canada? Or about 1,800 cases in the United States? Or nearly 2,400 cases globally? Do the numbers really matter?</p>
<p>With the new flu virus spreading quickly through many parts of North America and beyond, firm numbers of cases have less and less relevancy to public health efforts to respond to the outbreak, experts say.</p>
<p>While good estimates of the scope of disease activity are important in the early days of an outbreak, once a bug like this new H1N1 virus is spreading in a community, putting a figure on how many people are actually sick is, well, a guessing game.</p>
<p>"This counting of cases is some kind of 'folie a deux' or maybe 'folie a trois' that happens between politicians, public health people and the media,'' influenza expert Dr. Allison McGeer says, using a French phrase that means "madness shared by two'' (or three). "In an outbreak, you need to know whether it's going up or down. You need to know where you're going. But somehow -- and I don't fully understand the source or the psychology of this -- somehow we've evolved into: You have to have numbers.''</p>
<p>Trying to keep firm counts is especially futile with influenza, which is one of those tip-of-the-iceberg diseases. Most infected people never seek a doctor's help; and most doctors, in Canada at any rate, do not test for flu.</p>
<p>So far, Canada has reported 214 cases in nine provinces. In the U.S., where authorities reported yesterday they have 1,823 confirmed and probable cases in 44 states, a move toward qualitative rather than quantitative descriptions of the scope of the outbreak is on the horizon.</p>
<p>"At some point, reporting on individual cases no longer has value from a public health perspective,'' says Dr. Richard Besser, acting head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. "But knowing where in the country we're seeing large amounts of flu activity does remain important.''</p>

<p>EDMONTON</p>
<p>Federal health officials would not confirm reports yesterday that an elderly woman in northern Alberta with the H1N1 flu had died.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq's spokesperson said it is up to Alberta officials to release information on people in their province.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Minister Ron Leipert was asked about the death yesterday afternoon and said he has no information about it.</p>
<p>The CBC said it was not clear if H1N1 flu was the cause of death or if she had underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>A total of 44 people have died of the flu strain in Mexico and two in the US.</p>
<p>In total, there are 214 confirmed cases of H1N1 in Canada.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan joined the list of places with swine flu with health officials confirming yesterday the first positive cases in the province.</p>
<p>A teenage girl in the Saskatoon Health Region and a woman in her mid-20s from the Regina area have the H1N1 virus, said Dr. Moira McKinnon, provincial chief medical health officer.</p>
<p>"Both have mild illnesses, both had vacationed in Mexico and both are well now,'' said McKinnon. "They don't pose any risk to anyone else at this stage.''</p>
<p>Neither the teen nor the woman required hospitalization.</p>
<p>The woman isolated herself, say officials with the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region. Dr. Johnmark Opondo, the deputy medical health officer in Saskatoon, says the teenage girl "was not in school while she was symptomatic.''</p>
<p>"I think if there was any exposure, it may have been very minimal or mild. However . . . we will definitely be talking with the school and the school board,'' said Opondo.</p>
<p>"But we don't believe there was a lot of exposure in the school.''</p>
<p>Opondo said a couple of the teen's family members did have flu symptoms, but "they've all recovered now so there isn't an indication for doing any more testing.''</p>
<p>The teenager is expected to return to classes next week.</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan cases bring to 214 the number of confirmed cases of H1N1 in Canada.</p>
<p>Alberta reported three more mild cases yesterday, bringing that province's total to 33.</p>
<p>Ontario confirmed seven new cases, bringing the total number of cases in the province to 56. Of those, 12 people acquired swine flu in Ontario and nine don't know where they might have caught it, said Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the cases in Canada have been mild.</p>

</p>
<p>English is not the official language of Edmonton city hall. The official language of City Hall is Bafflegab.</p>
<p>Public servants take everyday language and jumble the syntax, juggle the context, beat the hell out of the facts and then chug an ozenday eerbays. Oops, that was Pig Latin. My bad.</p>
<p>Note to the public: You can't catch the swine flu by reading Pig Latin. So carry on.</p>
<p>Where was I? Right, Bafflegab. I've studied City Hall long enough to not only understand Bafflegab, but write it as well. But you knew that.</p>
<p>At any rate, the following is a public service column. It offers translation services for Bafflegab into English, not to mention a serious blow to what was left of my credibility.</p>
<p>GORMAN. Translates roughly as: Whatwherenow?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the citizenry was left this week with a mistaken belief that the federal and provincial governments granted money to Edmonton for an LRT extension to "Gorman."</p>
<p>As if.</p>
<p>I'm skeptical about there even being a Gorman, unless we're talking a planet close to the Klingon home world.</p>
<p>Has anyone actually been to this "Gorman?" Exactly.</p>
<p>I suspect someone in the civil service Bafflegabbed the list of "shovel-ready" infrastructure projects eligible for government funding. Then they forgot to translate it into common sense when they sent the forms to the Harper and Stelmach governments.</p>
<p>It sure was funny to hear Premier Ed Stelmach and Minister Rona Ambrose say "Gorman" at the recent press conference. Gorman, here we come. Next stop, Gorrrrr-man.</p>
<p>Let's get real. Why would any sane politician invest $300 million in our LRT to Nowhere, just to extend it further to the northeast, out past the Clareview station to, uh, nowhere?</p>
<p>Council better not get lost in translation.</p>
<p>The grants better be reallocated to the proper project, the NAIT LRT line. If not, we're going to Gorman. Should be easy to get a seat on the train, though.</p>
<p>HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS. Translates roughly as: Far, far less than hundreds or thousands.</p>
<p>Coun. Tony Caterina is the David Beckham of Bafflegab. No one else can take reality and Bend It Like Tony. Some days, I almost think he's serious. Then I remember, it's just Bafflegab, where black means white, yes means no, and Caterina means to get re-elected, somehow.</p>
<p>Caterina was on CHED radio this week complaining about the "misinformation" being tossed about by people who want to close the City Centre Airport. By people, he meant Mayor Stephen Mandel.</p>
<p>So Caterina sounded all serious until he started on a bender -- bending words, that is. Caterina Bafflegabbed that closing the airport will cost this city "hundreds" of businesses and "thousands" of jobs.</p>
<p>If you didn't know any better, you might think Caterina was using some exaggerated misinformation himself. But once you understand Bafflegab, you realize Caterina wasn't saying much of anything at all.</p>
<p>CRACKDOWN. Translates roughly as: Not a crackdown.</p>
<p>A city council committee heard this week about plans for a "crackdown" on noisy motorcycles. Thus, further study will be done. The province will be consulted. The public will be educated. Front-line cops will be asked if they wouldn't mind occasionally enforcing noise laws.</p>
<p>Councillors then adjourned the discussion until the fall, when it will be much quieter downtown. And I'm thinking: Maybe I'll move to Gorman.</p>
<p>INAPPROPRIATE: Translates roughly as: Screw You, Mandel</p>
<p>OK, we're back to Caterina. On the same CHED interview he Bafflegabbed about how he thought it was inappropriate that Mandel would talk about redeveloping the City Centre Airport into something cool. Why inappropriate? Caterina said studies into the airport lands won't be released until late June.</p>
<p>Therefore, Caterina thinks Mandel jumped the gun. Caterina was surprised the mayor would speak out in favour of developing the airport until all the information is in.</p>
<p>Caterina, of course, has been arguing the other side for months. He even talked of bringing scheduled air service back to the old Muni.</p>
<p>So how is that Mandel's comments are premature and inappropriate, but Caterina's are tickety-boo?</p>
<p>At city hall, we don't even call that Bafflegab. We call it bee-ess. No translation required.</p>

<p>After a week of confusion, the provincial government will ensure that all parents are notified if the H1N1 swine flu strikes their child's school.</p>
<p>It's a welcome reversal of a muddled policy that led to parents of children at an Airdrie school being notified, while only some were told when an Edmonton schoolgirl fell seriously ill.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert was ready to announce the change Thursday in the legislature, but no opposition members asked him the question. He talked about it later on the phone.</p>
<p>The government decided "it would be consistent across the province that the regional medical office would inform the school that there was a confirmed case of influenza in the school, and that parents should be advised," Liepert said.</p>
<p>"At the end of the day, it's still up to the school board to notify, but that would be our advice, to do that."</p>
<p>Technically, school boards can use discretion unless the province declares an emergency. That isn't likely to happen, at least in this round of the flu.</p>
<p>But it's hard to imagine boards failing to follow the new provincial "advice." They'd be wide open to public outrage and even lawsuits.</p>
<p>There's still no thought of closing schools when cases turn up. Dr. Andre Corriveau, the chief medical officer of health, doesn't think it's necessary.</p>
<p>Liepert even suggests school closures might even make the flu more difficult to contain by spreading students to malls and other areas.</p>
<p>The provincial ruling on notification came after a meeting with officials from health, education and Corriveau's office.</p>
<p>"It had sort of become evident that some regional officers of health were dealing (with flu) differently than others," says Liepert. "All we're trying to do is be consistent."</p>
<p>He concedes that the flu challenge has helped the government refine its pandemic plan by ironing out such kinks.</p>
<p>"This was a real-time exercise that fortunately hasn't come anywhere near pandemic proportions," Liepert says.</p>
<p>"It was a good exercise to make sure our pandemic plan works, and it does."</p>
<p>This might still be more than an exercise. Last night there was talk, still unconfirmed and hopefully untrue, that an elderly flu patient has died in northern Alberta.</p>
<p>That would be sad, but still no cause for alarm.</p>
<p>As officials are forever reminding us, hundreds of compromised patients die of regular seasonal flu every year, with hardly a whisper of public concern.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach, who meets OPEC leaders in Vienna today, picked an eventful week to be away.</p>
<p>He learned about the flu spreading from a farmer to his herd of swine just before getting on the plane last Friday.</p>
<p>It's now confirmed that the farm is in Clearwater County around Rocky Mountain House.</p>
<p>Stelmach decided the trip couldn't be cancelled at that late moment, so off he went.</p>
<p>This week, wildfires hit Stelmach's home area of east-central Alberta.</p>
<p>The premier sent best wishes to volunteer firefighters battling the blazes, including a soldier who'd only been back from Afghanistan for six hours when he headed out to help.</p>
<p>Stelmach returns on the weekend after learning a classic leader's lesson; there's no safe time for a premier to travel. It's all a matter of luck.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>If swine flu hits will our nurses be there for us?; After SARS crisis, many thought they were overlooked, undervalued</b>

</p>
<p>Would you show up for work if it meant putting your life at risk? What about the lives of your children?</p>
<p>Fortunately, most of us face little more than stress or fatigue when we head to our jobs, but for nurses, work can sometimes bring the risk of illness, even death. Which is why, six years after SARS claimed two Ontario nurses and a doctor among its victims, nurses in that province are keeping a close eye on the H1N1 virus. For many, the emotional trauma of SARS is still a vivid memory.</p>
<p>"I didn't sleep the night before I decided to work in the SARS unit," one nurse told the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario for a post-SARS report. "I knew that one suction catheter from a SARS patient would have enough virus in it to begin an epidemic."</p>
<p>H1N1, the current virus to put the world on edge, began in Mexico earlier this year and has travelled around the world, mostly in a mild form. There are signs it is beginning to retreat before it becomes a full-blown pandemic, but it has caught the worried attention of those who worked through SARS.</p>
<p>It has also raised some troubling questions about what happens next time, including this one: What if there is a pandemic and some health-care workers don't show up?</p>
<p>Pandemic absenteeism is such a worrisome possibility, that it has been widely studied with some startling results. One U.S. survey estimated that up to 50 per cent would be unwilling to work during an influenza pandemic, citing their own and their family's health. A German survey found that up to 28 per cent of health-care workers, "may abandon work in favour of protecting themselves and family." Surveys of physicians in Singapore and Australia also found many were concerned about protecting their families' health during a pandemic.</p>
<p>The tension between responsibilities to job and family was one of the stark realities of the SARS crisis for many nurses.</p>
<p>The report, SARS Unmasked, said nurses working in SARS units experienced frustration, anger, isolation and stigma.</p>
<p>Health-care workers are, of course, trained and prepared to face hardship and risk. That commitment is particularly strong during an emergency, such as a pandemic, says Doris Grinspun, executive director of the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario.</p>
<p>But even a strong sense of responsibility might break down in times of stress if health-care workers do not feel properly protected, supported or informed.</p>
<p>Those were some of the issues raised by nurses and nursing officials during the SARS crisis. Of particular concern was that nurses were not listened to. Between the second and third waves of SARS, many nurses believe that if health officials had listened to their concerns that the illness was not gone, further deaths could have been prevented.</p>
<p>Testimony from nurses led Justice Archie Campbell, who headed the commission of inquiry into SARS, to warn that health officials have to listen to nurses' and other health-care workers' concerns if they expect them to answer the call the next time.</p>
<p>"Every day, they stepped into danger," Campbell said. "I take away (from this work) not just the pain of the families, but a sense of wonder that nurses and doctors showed such courage."</p>
<p>Nursing officials were thinking of Campbell's warnings when the H1N1 virus caught the world's attention.</p>
<p>And has it been listening?</p>
<p>Many things have improved since SARS, says Grinspun.</p>
<p>When SARS hit, only about 50 per cent of nurses in the province worked full-time, meaning many of them had two, three or even four employers. A directive during the outbreak that nurses work at only one place created a dangerous and unanticipated nursing shortage as well as hardship for nurses. Five years later, nearly 65 per cent of nurses have full-time jobs.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a plan in place to deal with a pandemic or major health emergency and health workers, including nurses, are being informed and listened to. Part of the anxiety during SARS was that nurses felt they were being kept in the dark about what was going on.</p>
<p>H1N1 might prove to be a false alarm, but it might also serve as a useful reminder about listening to nurses and work yet to be done.</p>

</div><div>Sean Myers   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>610 words</div><div>8 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>E6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>V eteran Calgary Vipers pitcher Evan Greusel says he's detected a strong buzz from players arriving for spring training this weekend.</p>
<p>To start, they began arriving sooner than expected, up to a week early.</p>
<p>"I haven't seen that before, usually they all mostly arrive the day before the medical,"said Greusel, 29. "There's a lot more competition to make the team this year and they're getting right to work."</p>
<p>Players have to report today for their medical and camp officially begins Saturday. But the coaching staff was running full workouts Wednesday and Thursday on the field and then in the Vipers' new indoor training structure when it rained.</p>
<p>"You're not going to get on the team just for showing up this year," said Greusel, who threw the first pitch at the Vipers' initial home opener in 2005. "Guys are going to have to earn it."</p>
<p>The Vipers lost in the Golden Base-ball League championship the past two years.</p>
<p>They've have signed several returning veterans, such as perennial all-stars Carlos Duncan, Nelson Castro and Jorge Mejia. Pitcher Joe Sergent, who was 3-0 in the playoffs last year, has been secured to play a full season here after spending last year shuttling between Calgary and Oregon due to his teaching responsibilities south of the border.</p>
<p>The Vipers also just signed centre-fielder Fehlandt Lentini, who played in Calgary during the 2005 season and moved on to the Winnipeg Goldeyes. He's stolen 166 bases since his first stretch with the Vipers.</p>
<p>"Fehlandt is huge acquisition," said Greusel, who also serves as</p>
<p>the team's pitching coach. "I think we've upgraded every part of the team --speed, pitching, batting. On paper, this looks like our best lineup."</p>
<p>Snakes field manager Morgan Burkhart, promoted from hitting coach when Mike Busch was fired following last season's loss to the Orange County Flyers in Game 5 of the championship, won't go past the on paper pronouncement yet.</p>
<p>"On the board, we're up there, but I've got to see everyone,"said Burkhart, a former first baseman with the Boston Red Sox and Kansas City Royals. "A big part of it is how everyone jells together and we won't know the answer to that well into the season.</p>
<p>"If everyone's healthy and in the shape we expect them to be in, we've got some firepower, definitely. On all sides of the game -- pitching, defence and hitting."</p>
<p>After coming up short in the past two league finals--the Vipers lead going into the bottom of the ninth inning in Game 5 last summer -- Burkhart said there should be no mistaking their goal this season.</p>
<p>"We're definitely shooting for a championship, we're not shooting for a good season," said Burkhart. "That's our goal from the get-go."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Vipers learned Thursday they will have to wait a year before they get a chance to play the Tijuana Potros, a GBL expansion team from Mexico.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the H1N1 flu, popularly known as Swine Flu, has led to several closures of sports facilities and an uncertainty over stadium availability just two weeks before the season begins. The Potros decided to postpone operations for a year, according to a league statement.</p>
<p>The Vipers' season starts against the Long Beach Armada at Foothills on May 21.</p>

<p>Re: "Employers must be ready for a health crisis," Howard Levitt, Opinion, May 6.</p>
<p>Howard Levitt had some good advice and some really bad advice. Suggesting sick employees not come to work: Good. Suggesting they prove they are sick by going to the doctor: Very bad. It should never be the role of the doctor or the public health-care system to be your HR department's attendance policemen. Sending your medically stable yet potentially infectious employees for a note to prove they are sick into a waiting room of vulnerable potential victims being taken care of by an overwhelmed health-care provider during a pandemic, is unethical and irresponsible.</p>
<p>Deal with your attendance problems in a more mature manner!</p>

whole waiting rooms full of sick folks, like these at a northeast
calgary clinic, to contagion.

<p>T wo billion people -- or a third of the world--will become infected if the human swine flu becomes a pandemic, the World Health Organization warned Thursday.</p>
<p>If the virus turns more virulent or becomes established in multiple countries outside North America, "if we do move into a pandemic, then our expectation is that we will see a large number of people infected worldwide,"WHO's acting director-general Dr. Keiji Fukuda said.</p>
<p>Based on past pandemics, "it would be a reasonable estimate to say perhaps a third of the world's population would get infected with this virus,"he said.</p>
<p>He said it is premature to predict how many people would get severely ill or die.</p>
<p>But, "when you look at a third of the world's population, and recognizing that we're a globe of a little over six billion people, that's a lot of people to get infected,"he said.</p>
<p>While most people get only a mild infection, the vast numbers involved in a worldwide pandemic mean that "there are still very large numbers of people who could develop pneumonia, require respirators, (and)who could die."</p>
<p>Still, Fukuda said there is no evidence the virus is establishing the kind of community spread in other parts of the world as it has in North America. He said WHO's pandemic alert remains at phase five on a scale of six.</p>
<p>"We remain at phase five. That has not changed. We continue to see human-to-human transmission, community-level transmission primarily in North America. We are not seeing it yet anywhere else."</p>
<p>On Thursday, WHO raised its global totals to 2,371 lab-confirmed cases of swine flu, including 44 deaths--42 in Mexico and two in the U. S. Twenty-four countries have reported cases of influenza A (H1N1) infection.</p>
<p>Canada's public health agency confirmed 13 new cases across the country Thursday, bringing the national total of confirmed cases to 214.</p>

</p>
<p>An Alberta hog operation that is under quarantine after pigs on the farm contracted the H1N1 virus is located in Clearwater County, municipal officials confirmed Thursday.</p>
<p>County administrators would not identify the farm --which made international headlines when pigs at the operation contracted the new flu virus that has been infecting humans--but said it's located in the large rural municipality that surrounds Rocky Mountain House.</p>
<p>"We were advised yesterday the hog operation under quarantine is in Clearwater County," said Ron Leaf, the county's municipal manager.</p>
<p>The animals were exposed to the virus after a worker on the family-run farm returned from Mexico with flu symptoms in what's believed to be the first time the influenza strain, formerly called swine flu, has been found in pigs.</p>
<p>More than a dozen countries have since banned Canadian pork and live hogs, dealing a major blow to producers.</p>
<p>Alberta Agriculture has only said the farm is in the central part of the province and would not provide further details Thursday.</p>
<p>A report on the World Organization for Animal Health's website also said the farm, which has more than 2,000 pigs, is located in Clearwater County.</p>
<p>The document said some 450 pigs were sickened after a carpenter hired by the farm owner travelled to Mexico, returned April 12 and became ill two days later.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alberta Health announced new cases of the virus in three people Thursday. The province said two male children from central Alberta with no history of travel to Mexico and a woman from Edmonton who had been in Mexico all have mild cases of the virus.</p>
<p>The Alberta government also said Thursday it will now be advising school boards to inform parents when a child at a school has a confirmed case of H1N1 influenza.</p>

<p>The H1N1 influenza virus has struck down the Tijuana Potros. The expansion franchise was to make its debut in the Golden Baseball League in two weeks' time but will instead be suspending operations for the upcoming season.</p>
<p>"It's certainly a painful and difficult exercise for the teams, and especially the Potros," league commissioner Kevin Outcalt said during a conference call on Thursday.</p>
<p>The league will move ahead with nine teams and open nights on the schedule. For the Edmonton Capitals that will mean the deletion of three home games between Aug. 21-23, although the club is looking at alternative options with the Calgary Vipers and Victoria Seals. Kid camps might be a possibility.</p>
<p>For all the remaining teams, meanwhile, it could mean the addition of another player or two. A dispersal draft will be held today for those Potros players under contract -- including Darryl Brinkley, who was named Baseball America's independent league player of the year when he was with the Calgary Vipers in 2007.</p>
<p>"The players will either be selected and assigned to a new GBL team or released so they can look for an another opportunity," Outcalt continued.</p>
<p>"These things happen so you deal with them. There are some silver linings. We run 88 games in about 100 days so this actually gives the teams an opportunity to do some creative things when the team is home -- and to do some things that benefit the community."</p>
<p>The Capitals will also have an easy adjustment in respect to their road schedule as they were to play the Scorpions in Yuma, Ariz., on the same trip that they were going to Mexico. The long-term plan is to have the Potros back for the 2010 season.</p>
<p>"The H1N1 virus health risk and the necessary government response and actions have wreaked havoc with the economy and businesses small and large throughout the country," Potros president Jose Manuel Pena said in a team statement.</p>
<p>"It is not possible to operate with this uncertainty that keeps sponsors from committing, fans from buying tickets, and the stadiums unavailable to host public events."</p>
<p>David Kaval, the GBL president and CEO, said that because the virus is so widespread, a task force has been formed to monitor any future developments, such as travel restrictions.</p>
<p>"There is still uncertainty," he said. "Obviously, it was strongest in Mexico, but we'll continue to monitor the situation in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>"The plan is for the team to be back providing everything is OK from a health perspective. We assume at that point it would be an issue in the stadium and the conditions in the market will be suitable to launch a team. Or just operate a business. Everything was just sort of shut down down there. We had to make a decision."</p>

<p>Two billion people -- or a third of the world -- will become infected if the human swine flu becomes a pandemic, the World Health Organization warned Thursday.</p>
<p>If the virus turns more virulent or becomes established in multiple countries outside North America, "if we do move into a pandemic, then our expectation is that we will see a large number of people infected worldwide," WHO's acting director-general Dr. Keiji Fukuda said.</p>

<p>On Thursday, WHO raised its global totals to 2,371 lab-confirmed cases of swine flu, including 44 deaths -- 42 in Mexico and two in the U.S. Twenty-four countries have reported cases of influenza A (H1N1) infection.</p>
<p>Canada's public health agency confirmed 13 new cases across the country Thursday, bringing the national total of confirmed cases to 214.</p>
<p>Alberta reported three new cases, bringing the province's total of confirmed H1N1 infections to 33. Two of the new cases are children from central Alberta, neither of whom had travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>Both have mild symptoms, unlike the Edmonton-area girl who was hospitalized this week after being hit more severely with the illness. Doctors say she is improving, but there was no word Thursday on when they expect her to return home.</p>
<p>Neither of the two children had a travel history to Mexico.</p>
<p>The third new case is that of a woman from the Edmonton area, who was recovering after returning from Mexico.</p>
<p>Health officials are also testing a deceased patient from northern Alberta for swine influenza, sources said on Thursday night. Results from the tests were not yet available, but if the patient did have the influenza strain, it would be the first time someone with the disease has died in Canada.</p>
<p>Media reports suggested the patient was an elderly woman.</p>
<p>A study by American government scientists released Thursday reveals some signature features of the infection.</p>
<p>An analysis of the first 642 confirmed cases of human infection with the outbreak strain of swine flu found most involved typical, garden-variety flu symptoms -- fever, cough and sore throat.</p>
<p>But about 38 per cent of cases also had vomiting or diarrhea, "neither of which is typical of seasonal influenza," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team writes in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>The age of patients ranged from three months old to 81 years; 60 per cent were 18 years of age or younger. Only five per cent were 51 or older. Twelve cases in the U.S. involved children under age one.</p>
<p>"It is likely that the number of confirmed cases underestimates the number of cases that have occurred," according to the authors.</p>
<p>But the journal's editors said that, although the first cases were identified just over a month ago, "it seems unlikely that this outbreak will lead to widespread, severe illness and deaths.</p>
<p>"However, this may be just the first wave ... "</p>
<p>Officials are nervously watching what happens as the Southern Hemisphere enters its winter season, when flu viruses typically thrive. Will the virus go to the Southern Hemisphere, and, if it does, what will happen?</p>
<p>Populations in developing countries can be more vulnerable to flu because of malnourishment, war and conditions such as HIV infections, Fukuda said.</p>
<p>When seasonal flu hits, "what has been relatively mild for populations in the developed world, in fact is quite severe in its impact in the developing world. These are very big concerns for us."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canada, U.S. and Mexico called for an immediate lifting of bans on pork imports sparked by fears over swine flu.</p>

<p>Mexican office workers were forced to sit six feet apart on Thursday and cinemas were told to allow a spare seat either side of each customer as tough new regulations to halt the spread of swine flu came into force.</p>
<p>After a five-day shutdown, in which Mexico City's 20 million residents were told to stay at home, life began to return to normal after 42 people died from the virus.</p>
<p>Cafés serving sizzling tacos reopened their swing doors and schoolchildren returned to their desks.</p>
<p>However, they had to contend with tough new rules to limit infections caused by the H1N1 virus. Restaurants could only seat one-half of their capacity and all staff, from waitresses to cashiers, were supposed to wear surgical masks, while office-based companies were urged not to hold meetings. In theatres and cinemas, not only did a spare seat have to be allowed for on each side of a customer, but also in the rows in front and behind.</p>
<p>"It's all a bit surreal," said Claudia Bernal, 39, as she was served a chili and egg breakfast by a waiter in a blue mask. "We are used to crowds and hustle and bustle. This is a like a different city."</p>
<p>The new rules brought some marked improvements. In the normally grimy subway system, staff rushed around cleaning everything from train seats to ticket machines and offering customers hand-cleaning gel.</p>
<p>However, Mercurio Cruz, manager of an Argentine-style steak house, said losing one-half of his customers would annihilate his profits.</p>
<p>"I'm just opening so I can keep paying my staff, but I won't make any money," he said. "The government has to relax these rules soon."</p>
<p>Mexico has estimated its losses from swine flu at $2.3 billion U.S.</p>
