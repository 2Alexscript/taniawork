<p>A swine flu pandemic is looming closer with the virus showing early signs of spreading outside the Americas, a WHO official said yesterday as Africa reported its first case and Australia's tally soared to nearly 500.</p>
<p>"Globally we believe that we are at Phase 5 but are getting closer to Phase 6," said Keiji Fukuda, World Health Organization assistant director-general, referring to the agency's six-level pandemic alert system.</p>
<p>Phase 5 signals that a pandemic is imminent, while the world would be in a full-fledged pandemic - marking global spread - at Phase 6.</p>
<p>"It is clear that the virus continues to spread internationally," he said.</p>
<p>"We know there are a number of countries that appear to be in transition moving from travel-related cases to established, more established, community-type spread."</p>
<p>A criteria for the WHO to move the alert to Phase 6 would be established community spread in a country outside the first region in which the disease was initially reported - in this case, outside the Americas.</p>
<p>"We still are waiting for really widespread community activity in these countries, so I think it's fair to say they are in transition and are not quite there yet," Fukuda said.</p>
<p>But, he stressed, countries like Britain, Spain, Japan, Chile and Australia are showing larger numbers of H1N1 influenza infections, "with some early spread into communities."</p>
<p>Other than geographical spread, member states have asked WHO to integrate an assessment of the disease's severity into its criteria for moving up the alert scale and declaring a pandemic.</p>
<p>Almost 19,000 cases of infections including 117 deaths have been reported to the WHO by 64 countries around the world since the virus emerged in the United States and Mexico in April.</p>
<p>The renewed warning came as an Ontario man hospitalized for other ailments became Canada's third victim of swine flu, health authorities said yesterday.</p>
<p>On Monday, Canadian health authorities reported 194 new cases of the H1N1 virus, including four in the far north, bringing the total number of people with the virus in this country to 1,530, including 57 who are hospitalized.</p>
<p>The Egyptian case, the first in Africa, involved a 12-year-old girl with joint U.S. and Egyptian nationality who was quarantined by health workers at Cairo airport on Monday after she showed symptoms of the disease.</p>

</p>
<p>Health officials are investigating possible flu outbreaks at as many as 13 Ottawa schools, which they believe could be caused by the swine flu virus.</p>
<p>Another three schools have reported unusually high numbers of absent students, prompting officials to suspect the virus may have spread there, as well.</p>
<p>Because the risks of infection are particularly high among people who gather in large groups and in confined spaces, the school-based outbreaks, even before they are confirmed, have officials predicting the strain of the H1N1 flu virus has moved into a new phase that will likely lead to faster spread and more cases being reported over the summer and into the fall.</p>
<p>"With influenza, you pretty much know you're not going to be able to contain it," said Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's chief medical officer of health. "What we're trying to do is minimize spread in the community, and blunt the epidemic long enough for people to develop immunity in a natural way, or for the global community to develop a vaccine. That's really the strategy over the next six to 12 months."</p>
<p>Given the typical flu season ends by early spring, any flu outbreak that persists into June is likely the H1N1 virus, Levy said. "We assume that it's more widespread than we're seeing."</p>

<p>NURSES handed out face masks on Tuesday as preparations for a pandemic kicked into high gear in St. Theresa Point First Nation over heightened concern a severe flu will continue to infect healthy children and adults.</p>
<p>The isolated fly-in community of 3,200 could be the first in Manitoba to be hit hard by a suspected swine flu outbreak, confirming the "worst fears" of First Nations leaders who warned impoverished aboriginal reserves are ill-equipped to deal with widespread infections.</p>
<p>Chief David McDougall confirmed Tuesday an additional five children were flown to Winnipeg Monday night, bringing the total number of St. Theresa Point residents hospitalized to 12. In the last week, two pregnant women were medevaced to intensive care along with five other children who fell ill with severe flu symptoms.</p>
<p>One woman lost her child as a result of the illness. McDougall said lab tests have confirmed a strain of influenza is circulating, but there's still no word on whether the virus is the human swine flu that's surfaced worldwide.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, many residents wore masks to protect themselves as community leaders shut the school and told workers to stay home to avoid getting sick.</p>
<p>"The infection is influenza A, but what exactly it is, it will take days of more testing before we ascertain what it is," McDougall said.</p>
<p>McDougall said the big concern is that overcrowded homes make it easy for flu viruses to spread from person to person and infect more people. Close to half of the 1,300 residents who visited the nursing station in May reported flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>That's a sharp increase from the typical 800 visits made to the nursing station in a month, McDougall said.</p>
<p>A total of 41 residents were transported to Winnipeg last month, including at least 14 who reported a respiratory illness.</p>
<p>Health officials have flown in at least two additional nurses and two doctors to deal with the emerging respiratory crisis in the remote community, located 500 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Federal health officials did not respond to a request by the Free Press for an interview, but said in an email statement they are committed to protecting the health and well-being of First Nations populations.</p>
<p>"Health Canada is working closely with the community, Manitoba Health, Burntwood Regional Health Authority, the Public Health Agency of Canada and First Nations leadership to ensure support and information on the management of influenza is available to the community," the statement said.</p>
<p>To date, 11 Manitobans have tested positive for swine flu, including two Winnipeggers who have been hospitalized.</p>
<p>One man, a <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> employee in his 30s who works in Wuskwatim, remains in serious condition.</p>
<p>"He's in a delicate situation," said <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> spokesman Glenn Schneider.</p>
<p>Manitoba Grand Chief Ron Evans said St. Theresa Point is an example of what can happen when governments fail to address the poor social conditions that can help disease spread. Evans said the lack of health-care professionals and overcrowded homes make many communities prone to devastating effects of outbreaks, noting pandemic planning in many areas is still a work in progress.</p>
<p>"It gives you a good sense of how terrible and tragic will be when a community has to deal with an epidemic," Evans said. "No one expected H1N1 to surface at this time so the communities are caught off guard."</p>

<p>The new strain of H1N1 flu has generally spared the older population and so far caused mild illness in the majority of those it does strike, says Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer.</p>
<p>"There's very rare reports of people being positive over the age of 55," said Dr. Moira McKinnon.</p>
<p>The province has had 153 confirmed cases as of June 1, with new numbers slated to be posted today. Saskatoon has recorded the most, at 105, followed by Regina at 27.</p>
<p>The average age of those with confirmed cases is about 17, McKinnon said.</p>
<p>"What we're seeing with this virus is it spreads really quickly amongst young people. Some studies are showing that there's immunity in the older age group," McKinnon said.</p>
<p>There have been "clusters" of illness in young people, she noted, which contribute to the Saskatoon Health Region's leading position when it comes to flu numbers.</p>
<p>Quebec has also noted large clusters in the school age population, which gradually taper off, she said.</p>
<p>"It's a mild illness, so not sufficient to disrupt school programs if you can then isolate the child from the school."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health stopped its regular media flu briefings several weeks ago as it became clear that the new strain was not causing severe or even moderate illness in most cases.</p>
<p>But the provincial government continues to update H1N1 flu numbers on its website a few times a week in keeping with the practice of the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>"We're trying to make sure we're in harmony with the rest of Canada in the way that we do it so the results nationally can be interpreted easier."</p>
<p>Surveillance of the flu will continue through the summer, McKinnon said.</p>
<p>"The idea is to move over the next two to three weeks to what is called community surveillance," she said.</p>
<p>That will include looking at clusters of influenza-like illness that occur in institutions or come forward in emergency rooms, as well as regular testing by physicians that check patients as part of a flu watch system. Health regions are also making note of any severe cases of respiratory illness.</p>

<p>An Ontario man who died in hospital over the weekend had tested positive for the H1N1 flu virus, a spokesman with the Ontario Ministry of Health said yesterday. The adult male was the third person with swine flu to die in Canada. Spokesman Andrew Morrison said the man had underlying medical conditions.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Chalk up another species for the wily flu virus.</p>
<p>Humans, horses, dogs, whales, seals, birds, cats, ferrets and even raccoons are known to be susceptible to the tiny eight-gene viruses. Researchers in Tennessee have now added giant anteaters to that list.</p>
<p>"Who would have thunk it?'' senior author Dr. Melissa Kennedy said with a laugh. "We were pretty amazed.''</p>
<p>The February 2007 outbreak, involving 11 adult giant anteaters at Tennessee's Nashville zoo, is reported in an article that will be published in the July issue of the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. All the anteaters survived.</p>
<p>"Mainly it's an indication of how much we don't know, and the promiscuity of flu in terms of being able to change hosts and infect and adapt to new situations,'' says Dr. Jeffrey Hall, who last November added raccoons to the lengthening list of flu's hosts.</p>
<p>According to the article, the animals suffered a familiar litany of symptoms -- "severe'' nasal discharge, congestion, loss of appetite and lethargy.</p>
<p>Kennedy's team applied bits of the nasal secretions to a variety of different cell cultures, hoping something would grow.</p>
<p>To their surprise, two of three samples produced influenza A viruses of the H1N1 subtype -- the human type, not the new swine flu virus.</p>
<p>Sequencing of the genetic blueprints of four of the eight genes of the viruses showed they were virtually identical to the human H1N1 viruses circulating in Tennessee at the time.</p>
<p>Because it had been an unusually cold winter, the animals had been housed indoors when the outbreak happened.</p>
<p>They had no contact with other animals, and limited contact with people.</p>
<p>Though the theory hasn't been proven, the investigation into the source of the sickness points to their main caregiver, who was working with an undiagnosed respiratory illness.</p>
<p>It's not clear whether all the animals caught the flu from the zoo worker, or if some of the spread was anteater to anteater.</p>
<p>On the surface of it, it seems unlikely the anteater findings would have any implications for human health.</p>
<p>But Hall and others wonder if undiscovered pools of influenza viruses among species less studied than birds and pigs -- assumed to be the major players in the evolution of new flu viruses -- might contribute to the rise of new genetic variations that could work their way into humans.</p>
<p>"Is there an anteater flu out there that we don't know about?''</p>

</p>
<p>When news of a possible swine flu pandemic began to trickle out of Mexico in April, landlords and property managers across Canada congratulated themselves on their foresight.</p>
<p>Canada's major office buildings and retail and industrial malls are likely the best-prepared commercial structures in the world to face a global pandemic, says the Building Owners and Managers Association of Canada. It is all thanks to steps taken three years ago when BOMA Toronto kick-started a process that resulted in a comprehensive “pandemic guide for building owners and managers.”</p>
<p>Published in April, 2007, it sets out what building owners and property managers should do to keep their buildings operating and avoid legal liability if a pandemic strikes. Included was a 50-page workbook that is, in essence, a template for steps to be followed.</p>
<p>The workbook covers everything from communicating preparedness plans to tenants, to ensuring staff do not spread disease, to how to maintain key staff roles and systems as more and more people fall ill.</p>
<p>“To the best of our knowledge, Canada has the only pandemic preparedness plan for commercial properties in the world,” says Randall Rothbart, a BOMA Toronto director and a partner in law firm Solomon Rothbart Goodman LLP, whose contribution to the plan was writing the legal implications.</p>
<p>“Our rationale was that, if a pandemic strikes, then we must be ready to contain its spread while maintaining business operations within our members' buildings,” he says. “When it looked like H1N1 might turn into a pandemic, we were ready.”</p>
<p>Whether landlords could face lawsuits if they failed to do their best to help contain a pandemic or if tenants faced business losses because entire buildings had to be shut down is a grey area, he adds.</p>
<p>“However, now that there are guidelines in place, there may be an argument that landlords who fail to follow them may be liable for damages,” he says.</p>
<p>This enlightened approach to the dangers posed by pandemics was the brainchild of Cheryl Gray, senior vice-president of real estate services at Bentall LP in Toronto. Bentall manages 77 million square feet of commercial space across Canada and in the state of Washington, including 200 King St. W. in Toronto and the Bentall Centre in Vancouver.</p>
<p>“The idea came to me in 2003, shortly after the SARS epidemic struck Toronto,” she says. “I could easily see the impact other diseases could have on building operations right across Canada if a real pandemic struck.”</p>
<p>In early 2006, Ms. Gray began talking with other property managers such as Redcliff Realty Group, <span class="companylink">GWL Realty Advisors</span>, <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Oxford Properties Group Inc</span>. Together, they agreed to strike a committee under the umbrella of BOMA to create a comprehensive pandemic preparedness plan.</p>
<p>“We took as a template work done by the Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters association,” she says. “It was not to be a business continuity plan but one to ensure availability of labour and service at our buildings. There was lots of angst about pandemics then and an almost impending sense of doom.”</p>
<p>The final plan was not a document destined to sit on a bookshelf and be dusted off should the need arise. Almost immediately after its release, major landlords such as Bentall and Redcliff began taking steps to prepare for what they saw as the eventuality of a pandemic.</p>
<p>“We started about 18 months ago by doing three key things,” says Jonathan Fleischer, executive vice-president at Redcliff, which manages 26 million square feet of commercial, retail and industrial space, including major office towers such as 320 Bay St., 1 Yonge St., 65 Queen St. W. and 40 University Ave. in Toronto.</p>
<p>“The first thing was to send a letter to all tenants to inform them what Redcliff was doing to prepare for a pandemic and suggesting things they might do as well,” Mr. Fleischer says.</p>
<p>The second was to install hand-sanitizing stations in all lobbies, outside all washrooms and in service areas used by subcontractors, such as cleaners, security staff and delivery people. The third was to install posters in key areas advising of the threat of communicable diseases and the need to wash hands regularly as an effective preventive measure.</p>
<p>Redcliff, like other major property managers, also issued key staff with emergency kits that included rubber gloves, face masks and hand sanitizers. It even went so far as to stock buildings with emergency food supplies with a shelf life of up to five years.</p>
<p>Property managers then turned to ensuring there would be enough trained staff to maintain buildings. “That includes cross-training our own staff to ensure there are enough people available to maintain building systems, and reaching out to our service providers to ensure they have preparedness plans,” Mr. Fleischer says.</p>
<p>“We made use of all the lessons learned from events like 9/11, Y2K and the great power blackout earlier in the decade.”</p>
<p>When news of a possible swine flu pandemic began to appear, most major landlords activated the plan's first steps toward meeting the challenge, Ms. Gray says. At Bentall, that meant forming a five-person crisis management committee, which met daily by conference call.</p>
<p>“We identified staff who had recently been to Mexico and reminded them of the dangers and warning signs, and then regularly informed tenants and our building owners of both the progress of the disease and the measures we were taking should it begin to affect our operations,” she adds.</p>
<p>The wisdom of being prepared aside, most property managers understand a severe pandemic may still wreak havoc on operations.</p>
<p>“We have told tenants that, in case of a pandemic, we will try to maintain operations but there may indeed be some disruptions,” Mr. Fleischer says. “They should also make their own plans. We will not, for example, provide screening of visitors to our buildings. We will restrict deliveries to tenants and, in case of a severe event, we may have to close a building down.”</p>
<p>BOMA has tried to think of everything that landlords and owners can do to contain a pandemic and maintain operations, Mr. Rothbart says, but acknowledges that a pandemic could still throw a curve ball.</p>
<p>“A pandemic would be a moving target,” Mr. Fleischer says. “We can't say for sure how we will respond until an event occurs.”</p>

</p>
<p>If The Great Recession Of 2008/09 Had A Face, It would be that of the beleaguered auto industry, which was hit harder than any other industry when the economy swooned in the middle of last year. Actually, let's rephrase that and put it in the perspective of the Financial Post 500: The auto industry would be the face of the recession if more of its members had shown up at all for our annual ranking of Canada's largest companies by revenue.</p>
<p>As it stands, several major players in this sector -- all Canadian subsidiaries of publicly traded parent firms, and therefore not required to report financial data independently -- declined to participate in this year's ranking. The most notable absentee? General Motors Canada, which was for decades the nearly unchallenged king of the FP500, until surrendering its No. 1 position to Royal Bank of Canada in 2007. Also missing in action is Chrysler Canada. It ranked No. 16 last year, with revenue of more than $20 billion. When asked to share financial data this year, the company replied with a polite "thanks, but no thanks." Even Toyota Motor Manufacturing Inc., which runs the Japanese carmaker's plants in the southern Ontario towns of Cambridge and Woodstock, took a pass.</p>
<p>None of this should come as a surprise, though. The media is choked daily with bad news about the whole sector, from bailouts and</p>
<p>painful restructurings to layoffs and sales declines of historic proportions. Why share more gloomy information if you don't have to? After all, it's not like companies in the automotive sector are the only ones suffering this year, no matter how much attention they receive. A close look at our FP500 data confirms that.</p>
<p>At first, the top-line number on revenue increases suggests that the companies listed here skirted recession-induced disasters, with total revenue rising to almost $1.6 trillion, up marginally from $1.5 trillion the year before. But remember, the economy was flying close to the sun in the first half of 2008 -- before the big drivers of commodity and oil prices began to implode alongside the grounding of the financial sector's performance, brought on by the credit crunch. For this reason, a more telling statistic comes from comparing year-over-year</p>
<p>profit declines, which averaged 33.2% for FP500 companies. A grim figure, indeed. Worse still, this result was just a leading indicator in a sharp recession that had driven unemployment levels to 8%, the worst level in seven years, by our March 31 cut-off date for data collection. By that time, the loonie, which had soared far beyond par -- peaking above US$1.05 on strong commodities and record-setting oil prices that peaked near US$150 in July -- had dwindled to 85 cents U. S. Consumer confidence levels plumbed fresh lows.</p>
<p>Bleak as the overall results for fiscal 2008 appear to be, you'll still encounter the occasional bright spot in the data that's presented on the pages following this article. Some can be found in the capsule profiles of the FP500's top overall performers and highest climbers that accompany this article. But their stories aren't the only ones worth noting. Take, for instance, the performance of Suncor Energy Inc. (No.</p>
<p>7, up 13 spots from the year before), the leader on our ranking for largest revenue gain. It posted a 69.5% increase, for total revenue of $29.1 billion. True, most energy companies posted substantial gains this year, thanks to oil prices that were on a rampage until the middle of summer. (In fact, only one company in the FP500's top five revenue gainers -- Power Corp. of Canada -- was from outside the sector.) Interestingly, though, Suncor only credits part of its success to prices. It says one of the most significant drivers behind its performance was the implementation of, and improvements to, trading strategies for crude oil and natural gas.</p>
<p>Further positive news can be found with a quick look at the top profit gainers in this year's ranking. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan (No. 41) rode the highest, posting a profit gain of $2.5 billion and a total profit of $3.7 billion, as demand surged for its namesake product, a</p>
<p>key component in fertilizers. Energy companies Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (No. 21), EnCana Corp. (No. 5) and Talisman Energy Inc. (No. 38) also recorded profit gains in the billions of dollars, again largely thanks to oil prices. And even as the economy soured in the latter half of 2008, there were still a few winners to be found. Among them, Goldcorp. Inc. (No. 129), which enjoyed a record year for production and a 218% increase in profit, to $1.6 billion, as investors stampeded to the safety of gold when global stock markets began to collapse.</p>
<p>Overall though, it's difficult to escape the pall that hangs over this year's FP500. Though winners still outnumber losers by a strong margin, some of the revenue falls are steep. The worst belongs to Longueuil, Que.-based pharmacy retailer Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. (No. 149), which saw its income fall $10 billion, to $2.3 billion. The reason? Jean Coutu's decision in fiscal 2007 to sell its 1,500 U. S. Eckerd and Brooks drugstores, which had been weighing heavily on the company's performance.</p>
<p>Now out of the U. S. -- except for a 32% stake in Rite Aid Corp., the company that bought the Eckerd and Brooks chains -- Jean Coutu has taken a steep loss in revenue. But it is also rebuilding, rolling out expansion plans in Quebec, its traditional stronghold where sales have continued to grow. Meanwhile, on the biggest profit decline side, CIBC (No. 29), posted the biggest fall in 2008, watching $3.3 billion in net earnings the year before crumble to a $2.1-billion loss, largely due to writedowns earlier in the year related to the U. S. mortgage crisis.</p>
<p>Thankfully for CIBC -- and more importantly, the North American economy in general -- the worst of the recession may finally be behind us. It will be a while before economists and analysts can definitely state that we're past the bottom. But tentative green shoots started to emerge as this edition of the FP500 went to press. The S&P/TSX Composite Index, for example, was sniffing cautiously at the air above 10,000 in May, a display of optimism brought on by a slowing of the pace of economic bad news. The gains were tentative and highly susceptible to individual shocks. But at least there appeared to be a growing consensus that the lows below 8,000 in early March likely won't be tested again.</p>
<p>That's not a certainty, however. General economic conditions remains weak, and as the surprise outbreak of the swine flu outbreak in May demonstrated, depressing forces can come from almost any corner, no matter how unexpected, and knock a recovery off its feet. But if current indicators prove reliable, confidence in the economy will return, and recovery may be in the foreseeable future. All we can say for certain at this point, however, is that there will be better days ahead. Let's hope they arrive in time to be reflected in next year's FP500. Editor's Note: In the FP500 charts that follow this article, you'll notice that some companies are ranked at more than 500 for their position in last year's issue. The reason comes from how we compile our ranking. Eight hundred companies are surveyed each year and are ranked on a master list from which we draw the top 500. Prior rankings above 500 represent a company's position on the master list. We've published a companion ranking to the FP500, called The Next 300, on our website. In combination with the FP500, it shows our data universe. Read the Next 300 at financialpost.com/magazine.---------</p>
<p>2 NEW FLYER INDUSTRIES INC.</p>
<p>2008 RANK: 280 2007 RANK: 482 INCREASE: 202</p>
<p>ACCOLADES AND STRONG financial results made 2008 a banner year for Winnipeg, Man.-based New Flyer Industry Inc., the leading supplier of heavy-duty transit buses in the U. S. and Canada. Revenue climbed in 2008, reaching a record $1 billion. CFO Glenn Asham attributes the company's success to its strong order backlog and its customers, which are mostly municipal governments with relatively stable funding.</p>
<p>New Flyer also racked up lots of praise in 2008. It was named one of the Top 100 Employers in Canada and won EDC's Canadian Innovation Award for Global Business of the Year. In March of 2009, U. S. Vice-President Joe Biden called New Flyer "a model for other businesses."</p>
<p>Moving forward, Asham is optimistic about New Flyer's future. "With stimulus funds available in both the U. S. and Canada," he says, "demand for New Flyer's products is anticipated to remain very strong." -- Anna Miller</p>
<p>3 PETROBANK ENERGY AND RESOURCES LTD.</p>
<p>2008 RANK: 313 2007 RANK: N. A. INCREASE: 188</p>
<p>PETROBANK ENERGY and Resources Ltd.'s bustling activities in the Bakken light oil resource play boosted it into third place on the FP500 Highest Climbers list. The Calgarybased company drilled 185 wells in the Bakken in 2008, hitting oil every time. "We were the single largest driller in the Bakken last year," says Gregg Smith, chief operating officer of Petrobank's Canadian operations. "We didn't do that by acquiring companies -we did it predominantly by drilling up our Bakken lands."</p>
<p>Petrobank's Latin American business unit, Petrominerales Ltd. -a subsidiary in which it owns a 76.9% stake -also added to the company's fortunes. "Columbia was huge for us in 2008," Smith says. Petrobank increased its average production there to 10,967 barrels of oil per day, up 130% from its 2007 results. And the subsidiary is already posting strong 2009 numbers -Petrominerales's average production between January and May hit 25,252 barrels of oil per day. -C. T.</p>
<p>4 BAYTEX ENERGY TRUST</p>
<p>2008 RANK: 282 2007 RANK: 469 INCREASE: 187</p>
<p>NOT ALL BARRELS of oil are created equal. The difference in price increases for light oil and heavy oil, which is denser and more expensive to refine, is precisely what made Calgary-based heavy-oil producer Baytex Energy Trust the fourth-highest climber on the FP500 this year.</p>
<p>Light oil prices climbed 32% in 2008, while heavy oil prices shot up 55%, to US$84 per barrel from US$54. As a result Baytex Energy Trust, which produced about 23,530 barrels per day of heavy oil and 6,654 million cubic feet per day of natural gas in west central Saskatchewan and Alberta, hit $1 billion in revenue in 2008, up from $608.6 million in 2007.</p>
<p>"With their significant leverage to heavy oil at 60% of production, and heavy oil prices showing the greatest year-over-year gain in commodities in the oil and gas sector, Baytex benefi ted," says Mark Bridges, an oil and gas analyst at CIBC World Markets. --C. T.</p>
<p>5 CHEMTRADE LOGISTICS INCOME FUND</p>
<p>2008 RANK: 248 2007 RANK: 434 INCREASE: 186</p>
<p>THE MARKET FOR sulphuric acid never smelled sweeter to Chemtrade Logistics Income Fund than in 2008. Sales at the diversified chemical manufacturer and distributor more than doubled to almost $1.2 billion, as prices soared for sulphuric acid on increased demand from booming agricultural and base metals markets and a slowdown in sulphur supply due to reduced production at oil refineries in the U. S. "Chemtrade's management had their finger on the pulse of the market," says BMO Capital Markets analyst Bert Powell. "That enabled them to capitalize on the pricing opportunity."</p>
<p>With the market for sulphuric acid now oversupplied, Chemtrade may be hard pressed to match or even come close to last year's sales success. But that likely won't cause trouble for unit-holders. Even if revenues fall, Chemtrade is still expected to generate enough positive cash flow to support their double-digit quarterly distribution. --David Pett</p>

<p>TOP 5 HIGHEST CLIMBERS</p>
<p>CRESCENT POINT ENERGY TRUST</p>
<p>2008 RANK: 260 2007 RANK: 493 INCREASE: 233</p>
<p>SURE, HEALTHY OIL prices for most of 2008 made it a cake walk for energy outfits to post better revenue numbers than companies toiling in other sectors. But Crescent Point Energy Trust, which claimed the top spot this year on the FP500 Highest Climbers list, was helped by two earlier moves to solidify its position in Saskatchewan's Bakken, the largest conventional light oilfield in western Canada. In 2007, the company bought the Bakken oil companies Mission Oil & Gas Inc. and Innova Exploration Ltd. The benefit of those additional 10,000 or so barrels per day boosted revenue to $1.1 billion in 2008, a 171.1% increase from 2007.</p>
<p>The company now controls about two-thirds of the buzz-worthy Bakken, with 80% of its holdings sitting on the sweetest spots, says Scott Saxberg, Crescent Point's chief executive. "What sets us apart is the fact that we own a significant portion of the Bakken light oil play," he says. "We'll continue to acquire and grow."</p>
<p>Crescent Point also doubled its overall spending, a move that helped it increase production through drilling by 13%. The fact that the company has few natural gas assets also helped, as it was minimally impacted by the ugly prices that plagued the sector last year.</p>
<p>As for 2009, the company has already made good on its word to continue to expand its territory in Saskatchewan and the Bakken. Crescent Point, along with partner TriStar Oil & Gas Ltd., acquired Talisman Energy Inc.'s assets in Saskatchewan and Montana for $720 million. The deal, scheduled to close in early June, adds production and undeveloped acreage to Crescent Point's portfolio, and prompted the company to jack up its 2009 average daily production guidance to 40,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 38,250. Last month, Crescent Point also picked off privately held Wild River Resources Ltd. and Gibraltar Exploration Ltd., adding 2,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day and more undeveloped land to its portfolio.</p>
<p>"Our strategy isn't going to change," Saxberg says. "It has always been based on developing and exploiting our main assets, which now include our significant land positions in Saskatchewan and our focus in the Bakken." -- Carrie Tait</p>

<p>2 POWER CORP. OF CANADA</p>
<p>2008 REVENUE $37.1 BILLION REVENUE CHANGE: 26.2% 2007 RANK: 5</p>
<p>POWER CORP. OF CANADA moved up the FP500 in 2008, landing extremely close to the top slot. The financial-services holding firm grew revenue by more than 26% year over year, led by the acquisition of a block of annuity businesses in February by U. K. subsidiary Canada Life International Re Ltd. that provided an additional, steady stream of insurance income. "That's Power Corp.'s mantra," says Craig Fehr, analyst at Edward Jones & Co. "They look for businesses that have long-term growth profiles and can provide stable returns." As a result, Power, which is controlled by Montreal's Desmarais family, actually raised its dividend -- a rarity in 2008.</p>
<p>What lies ahead? Edward Johnson, Power's senior vice-president, is cautious about predictions, but says the company aims to continue prudently managing its stakes in its main holdings, insurer Great-West Lifeco and mutual-fund manager IGM Financial, while staying alert for more acquisitions. --Jamie Sturgeon</p>

<p>MANULIFE FINANCIAL CORP. fell from the second slot on the FP500 this year -replaced by rival financial services group Power Corp. of Canada -as revenue slid amid one of the most testing years in the company's history. The insurer was adversely affected by a 2004 decision to suspend the industry practice of hedging investments that were made to back up guaranteed payouts to customers. The decision turned against the company when markets crashed midway through last year, and helped push Manulife's stock price to a low of around $9 in March 2009, from $39 in October 2008, although it has since rebounded and was trading at around $22 in mid May.</p>
<p>Manulife hopes for a calmer year for the rest of 2009, with new CEO Donald Guloien at the helm. The company veteran aims to strengthen Manulife's reserves and one day extend the global group's footprint far beyond Canada, to India, Korea and Europe. -E. C.</p>
<p>4 GEORGE WESTON LTD.</p>
<p>2008 REVENUE $32.09 BILLION REVENUE CHANGE: 4% 2007 RANK: 3</p>
<p>AFTER 127 YEARS in business, George Weston Ltd. still knows how to ring up the sales. Its 4% revenue gain in 2008 (calculated using restated 2007 revenue figures) was attributed to pricing increases across key product categories at its two main subsidiaries, Weston Foods and Loblaw Cos. Ltd., that offset falling volumes. Weston was also aided by $281 million from the sale of Neilson Dairy in December. "Weston has proven an ability to deliver over time," says Michael Smedley, chief portfolio manager at Morgan, Meighan and Associates.</p>
<p>Turning the same sales trick in 2009 may prove more diffi-cult with the loss of Neilson and the company's U. S. fresh bakery business, which was sold to Mexico's Grupo Bimbo in December for a net gain of US$2.5 billion. But with cash to spend on revenue-generating acquisitions and sales at Loblaw already up 3% in the first quarter, Weston appears well positioned to keep its cash register filled. --David Pett</p>
<p>5 ENCANA CORP.</p>
<p>2008 REVENUE $32.08 BILLION REVENUE CHANGE: 39.3% 2007 RANK: 13</p>
<p>HIGHER OIL AND GAS prices helped a lot, but were only part of the reason that oil and gas giant EnCana Corp. reported a 39% increase in revenue last year. EnCana saw the future before it became obvious to competitors earlier this decade, when it repositioned itself to become a leader in the development of natural gas from shales in North America. That translated into an 8% increase in natural-gas production in 2008 over the previous year, to 3.8 billion cubic feet per day. The icing on the cake was a big windfall from hedging contracts.</p>
<p>With its market value swelling, EnCana announced plans last year to split itself into two distinct companies -- a pure natural-gas producer and a pure oilsands producer. But those plans were put on ice due to the credit crunch. Meanwhile, the company is being careful with overall spending this year amid a severe drop in natural-gas prices and weak demand for the fuel due to the recession. --Claudia Cattaneo</p>

<p>TOP 5 OVERALL LEADERS</p>
<p>ROYAL BANK OF CANADA</p>
<p>2008 REVENUE $37.57 BILLION REVENUE CHANGE: (9.1%) 2007 RANK: 1</p>
<p>LIKE A LARGE sea-faring vessel, the country's largest company cannot turn on a dime. So when the financial tsunami of 2008 struck, the Royal Bank of Canada had little choice but to batten down the hatches and try to ride out the storm.</p>
<p>Now, with the skies beginning to clear, RBC appears to have weathered the storm better than many. Sure, the bank suffered nearly $3 billion in writedowns and volatile markets negatively impacted its share price. But RBC managed to pull in relatively steady revenues despite watching its net income drop by about $1 billion, and as a result, the company retained its slot at the top of the FP500, a position it has held since 2006.</p>
<p>The healthy takings at RBC's Canadian retail bank branches were a big factor in sustaining revenue flow, and helped offset bruising losses at other units: The capital-markets unit, for example, was responsible for more than $2 billion in writeoffs and saw income drop by $1 billion. Activity also slumped at the wealth-management unit as market uncertainty drove customers away. RBC's international banking operation also fell into a loss as exposure to the U. S. construction sector wiped out profits at its American branch network.</p>
<p>A choice now confronts Gord Nixon, who as chief executive must decide whether to set a course for safer waters, navigating away from a reliance on lucrative-but-risky trading operations, or stick to the high seas of international finance. The early indications are that Nixon won't be making any major changes, and will continue to draw about 25% of RBC's income from capital-markets activity and 75% from more traditional retail banking.</p>
<p>The one development that could radically alter that course would be a mutiny by shareholders. If investors do not restore the valuation premium once enjoyed by the country's biggest bank, and its shares start to trade at a discount to its rivals, Nixon might reconsider. But at present, this doesn't appear very likely, and Nixon looks set to stay the course. -- Eoin Callan</p>

</p>
<p>IN TIMES OF TURMOIL, executives tend to go into survival mode. Amid efforts to reduce costs, innovation and expansion budgets often suffer the deepest cuts. This has always been wrong-headed, but may be particularly so today, when for many industries, reinvention is a necessity, not an option. The recession has pulled the curtain back to reveal pervasive problems affecting many Canadian industries, such as the mass media, which is having difficulty competing in the digital era, and the automotive sector, which hasn't modernized its business model or kept pace with shifting environmental attitudes.</p>
<p>But not everyone is playing defence: Some companies are focusing on innovation. Auto-parts manufacturer Linamar Corp., for example, is reinventing itself by expanding into the manufacturing of wind turbine parts and solar-powered lawn mowers. As CEO Linda Hasenfratz told the Financial Post in April, "As long as you're keeping your diversification within a spectrum that you have expertise in, then you're still doing something that you're good at."</p>
<p>In fact, downturns are ideal times to invest in the future. According to a recent study reported in Businessweek, companies that spent 10% more on innovation during the last recession grew at twice their industry average in the five years after. Here we take a look at seven Canadian companies that are making gutsy investments today -- and possibly shaping the futures of their industries.</p>
<p>Company: Zenn Motor Co.</p>
<p>Headquarters: Toronto</p>
<p>Key Innovation: Developing electric auto technology</p>
<p>THE CAR INDUSTRY'S collapse has distracted the big automakers from the race for the commercially viable green automobile -- giving little guys like Zenn Motor Co. a chance to jump ahead. A manufacturer of short-range, low-speed electric cars, Zenn has sold only 500 vehicles to date, mainly in the U. S. and in the only Canadian provinces that allow such vehicles on the roads, Quebec and B. C. But that's not the ultimate plan. Zenn has an exclusive partnership with EEStor, a Texas company that aims to produce electric batteries with 10 times the power of existing ones at a lower cost. The technology, says Zenn CEO Ian Clifford, "replaces petroleum. It has that capacity." If the prototypes prove commercially viable, Clifford envisions Zenn shifting away from building vehicles and becoming the electric-powertrain supplier to the world's major car brands.</p>
<p>Company: Medicago Inc. Headquarters: Quebec City Key Innovation: Using tobacco plants to make vaccines</p>
<p>TOBACCO COMPANIES HAVE often sought more healthful applications for the carcinogenic plant in which they've invested so much. So what could be better than using tobacco to produce medicine that could save the world</p>
<p>from a pandemic? Enter Medicago, a biotech company that is testing a method for cultivating a key protein for influenza vaccines -- expected to become a $45-billion global market by 2015 -- using tobacco leaves. Not only</p>
<p>is using tobacco cheaper than traditional methods, but faster, a critical factor in preventing an outbreak from turning into a pandemic. While other materials, such as eggs, take months to generate the key protein, tobacco does it</p>
<p>in four weeks. Last year, Medicago snared a $16-million investment from Philip Morris International to move its R&D into fast gear. Medicago plans to start human clinical trials on its avian flu vaccine later this year. If that product</p>
<p>proves successful, the company intends to apply its technology to the production of vaccines for everything from malaria to HIV. In the meantime, the company is already doing research that could lead to a vaccine for the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Company: Maxtech Manufacturing Inc. Headquarters: Waterloo, Ont. Key Innovation: Retooling an auto plant to make products for the oil industry</p>
<p>AS ONTARIO'S AUTO-PARTS industry shrinks, manufacturers like Maxtech are seeking healthier sectors for their expertise and technology -- such as, in Maxtech's case, Alberta's oil patch. Like its peers, Maxtech has had a rough few years -- its workforce is down to about 300 from</p>
<p>500, and revenue has dropped by half, to $50 million -- as high commodity prices, a soaring loonie and now dwindling demand for its brake rotors and other parts cut into its business. In response, the company is leading an ambitious push into the oilsands. Maxtech has teamed up with</p>
<p>Syncrude Canada Ltd. to use its patented laser technology to build giant screens that will help dump-truck operators sift sand from rock during oil extraction. The prototype for the machine that will create the screens (above) is currently being developed at the University of Waterloo. Meanwhile, Maxtech is spearheading a proposal to the Ontario government asking for funds to help auto-parts suppliers move into new business niches.</p>
<p>Company: Ledcor Group of Cos. Headquarters: Vancouver Key Innovation: Leader in green-building movement</p>
<p>LONG BEFORE ENVIRONMENTALLY friendly buildings became a trend and market force, the construction giant Ledcor Group of Cos. spotted an opportunity. In 1997 -- four years before the international LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) designation came to Canada -- it erected a building for Revenue Canada that exceeded energy-conservation requirements by 30%. The employee-owned firm has since invested in getting staffers LEED-certified and has been involved in eight sustainable projects, including the tallest building in Vancouver, Shangri-La (above), and the only LEED Platinum building in Canada, the Gulf Islands National Parks Reserve Operations Centre in Sidney, B. C. Now, as the construction sector sags along with the economy, Ledcor is pitching its green-building expertise to institutional and corporate clients that increasingly covet the eco-friendly image. "This game is not very old," Murray MacKinnon, who leads the company's green-building practice, told a conference of contractors recently. "But your biggest clients are now asking for it."</p>
<p>Company: Internet Broadcast Corp.</p>
<p>Headquarters: Montreal</p>
<p>Key Innovation: Syndicating news and video from around the world</p>
<p>THE FIVE-YEAR-OLD start-up Internet Broadcast Corp. has come up with a way it believes will help revitalize dead-tree media brands by making their news websites more dynamic, culturally diverse and, most importantly, profitable. Known mainly under its MediaScrape brand, the company aggregates news clips from broadcasters around the world, including the BBC, Reuters and CBC, and translates them for news websites. Editors can adapt the video to their markets by generating news summaries and multi-language subtitles on the fly. Last summer, Mediascrape became the first Canadian partner of Google's AdSense for Video, which allows website operators to insert ads into video footage as it airs. Putting these tools into newspapers' hands can help them compete with sites like YouTube, says Internet Broadcast Corp. CEO Tyler Cavell. The VC community seems to agree: Last year, Mediascrape was named the most promising Canadian start-up by Red Herring, the bible of the tech investment community.</p>
<p>Company: Enmax Corp.</p>
<p>Headquarters: Calgary</p>
<p>Key Innovation: Turning households into energy generators</p>
<p>AS THE BACKLASH against greenhouse-gas emissions gains momentum, Calgary-area electricity distributor Enmax is trying to tap into the growing environmental consciousness -- and save costs by reducing demand on its transmission infrastructure -- by allowing consumers to generate their own power. In a pilot program, Enmax employees (including CEO Gary Holden) are testing a series of "micro-generation" technologies that the company hopes to offer as rental options to homeowners. These include small wind generators (mainly for rural areas), solar-heated hot-water tanks and a system that lowers energy consumption by producing both heat and electricity from natural gas. Exmax will also offer homeowners smart meters that allow them to track and moderate their power use throughout the day. The utility, which already runs the largest wind farm in western Canada and a facility in downtown Calgary that delivers "waste heat" from its electricity plants to nearby buildings, sees distributed micro-generation as a giving it a competitive edge in a deregulated electricity market where consumers can choose their provider.</p>
<p>Company: Cineplex Entertainment LP</p>
<p>Headquarters: Toronto</p>
<p>Key Innovation: Transforming movie theatres into entertainment complexes</p>
<p>CINEPLEX'S SILVERCITY Oakville complex is the buzzing, twinkling, sprawling future of movie theatres. So, at least, believe many of Hollywood's top dons. The traditional movie-house model has long been in decline across the continent as cinemas compete with a growing number of entertainment options, sending exhibitors in search of new ways to fill their spaces in off-peak hours. Cineplex has led the way by opening its screens to simulcast sporting events and opera performances. Its 45,000-square-foot indoor playground in suburban Toronto, which opened in December 2007, is the next evolutionary step, catering to all ages and tastes with everything from bowling to fine dining. Last year, Cineplex CEO Ellis Jacob received the top honour at the industry's annual trade show in Las Vegas for "changing the face of exhibition in North America." But he's hardly done with the facial reconstruction: Cineplex is opening three complexes based on its Oakville model and plans to install 3D systems in 175 theatres across the country, one of the biggest bets on the technology in North America. broadened its mandate, incorporating bowling concerts, sporting events and rock shows</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Second swine flu victim dies in hospital; Not known if H1N1 virus a factor in death of man who had been fighting congestive heart failure</b>
</div><div>Theresa Boyle   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>497 words</div><div>2 June 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT02</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>A second Torontonian with swine flu has died.</p>
<p>A 60-year-old Toronto man who had the H1N1 flu virus and suffered from congestive heart failure died on Sunday.</p>
<p>The man had been hospitalized for about three weeks at Toronto Western Hospital where staff recently had begun removing him from life support.</p>
<p>It is not known whether the virus was a factor in the man's death, said Andrew Morrison, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>"We understand that the person had a number of underlying medical conditions. We do not know how the flu contributed to the person's death," he said.</p>
<p>Ten days ago, a 44-year-old Scarborough man with the virus died. The man also had diabetes and significant heart disease and an autopsy failed to show whether the virus was a factor in his death.</p>
<p>The man had been treated for a cough in the days prior to his death and was only tested and confirmed to have had the virus following his death.</p>
<p>There have now been three deaths in Canada of individuals with the H1N1 virus. A 39-year-old northern Alberta woman who had the virus and also suffered from diabetes and asthma, died on April 28. A post-mortem failed to show whether the virus played a role in her death.</p>
<p>To date, there have been 715 confirmed cases of the virus in Ontario, most of them in Greater Toronto and most of them mild. As of Sunday, there were six Ontarians with the virus in hospital; four suffer from other medical problems and two do not, according to Morrison.</p>
<p>Meantime, a trustee with the Toronto District School Board is angry Toronto Public Health is no longer informing the board every time a student tests positive for the virus and that letters are no longer issued to parents of children at a school when a student there is confirmed to have the bug.</p>
<p>"It's not really a matter of whether this strain is more worrisome than the regular flu - that's for the experts to decide - it's how it's perceived by parents," trustee Josh Matlow said yesterday.</p>
<p>"The fear of the unknown is what I don't want my community left with. It involves their kids."</p>
<p>Rishma Govani, a spokeswoman with Toronto Public Health, explained that no special measures are required when there is a case of the virus at a school or daycare.</p>
<p>"The virus is circulating in the community and whether or not there is a confirmed case, your action shouldn't be different ... Just continue to practise good hygiene," she said.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus causes illness very much like regular seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>Most people infected with the new virus have recovered without the need for medical care.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Fritsch searches for game in more ways than one</b>
</div><div>Gord Holder   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>926 words</div><div>1 June 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>It has been, in his own words, "a weird year" for Brad Fritsch.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old professional golfer from Manotick again has non-exempt or conditional status on the U.S.-based Nationwide Tour, and his ranking on that list is actually a handful of spots higher than it was last year, when he finished 74th on the money list with nearly $94,000.</p>
<p>However, an assortment of developments limited Fritsch to just two of the first nine tournaments of 2009, and he missed the cut in those events in Panama and South Carolina.</p>
<p>That left him with a lot of time to practise. Too much, maybe.</p>
<p>"You can sit out on the range and pound balls all day, but the range doesn't look like a golf course, where you have to hit it around a corner or in the hole," Fritsch said from his home just outside Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>
<p>This past week's Rex Hospital Open took place at Fritsch's home course, TPC Wakefield Plantation, and he received a sponsor's exemption that allowed him to skip the "go low or go home" Monday qualifier.</p>
<p>He went 1-for-4 on Mondays earlier in the season, playing his way into an April tournament at Athens, Georgia, but his wife, Megan, went into labour two days later. Fritsch scrambled home in time for the birth of their first child, Hannah.</p>
<p>In that respect, forced time off from competitive golf has been good, allowing Fritsch to adapt to fatherhood. Little Hannah is quite healthy, he reports, and shares his personality: "She's real quiet, and she likes to sleep."</p>
<p>There won't be much time for Fritsch to sleep when he's on the course, that's for sure.</p>
<p>As a regular at TPC Wakefield, he knew the course better than anyone else on the Nationwide Tour, so he counted on having a good week, and it turned out to be something of a split decision: He made the cut, but a final-round 73 left him with a four-round total of 276 and a tie for 30th, which was enough to earn $3,150 U.S., but was not enough to qualify him directly for this coming week's Melwood Prince George's County Open.</p>
<p>So today he's in another Monday qualifier, hoping to make enough birdies to earn a spot in the tournament at Mitchellville, Maryland. If not, the backup plan involves flying Tuesday from Baltimore to Seattle -- attention, Canadian airline customers, that one-way ticket cost him $100 U.S. -- and a ferry ride to Victoria, where the Canadian Tour's Times-Colonist Open starts on Thursday. Fritsch played for his first six years as a pro on the Canadian circuit and has since maintained membership with it.</p>
<p>After Victoria, he may head back to Tennessee, for the next available Nationwide tournament. As of last week, he was sixth or seventh alternate for the Knoxville Open, so there was a decent chance he'd make it into that field.</p>
<p>If that was to happen, it would represent a change in the situation that has caused Fritsch's relatively idle schedule.</p>
<p>The United States economy being what it has been, there have been just 10 Nationwide events so far this season, which means those golfers with full status have been less likely to take weeks off, leaving fewer openings for non-exempt players.</p>
<p>In addition, some of those first 10 tournaments conflicted with significant PGA Tour events, leading lower-ranked or non-exempt players from that circuit to exercise their option to drop into Nationwide fields and again bumping Fritsch and those like him.</p>
<p>Now there are just three tournaments left before the tour reshuffles its conditional-??player rankings based on earnings. That was why it was imperative for Fritsch to play well at Raleigh even if he had been hoping to treat it "like a game with the boys."</p>
<p>At least he should be able to look forward to increased opportunities in the next few months. The swine flu outbreak caused Nationwide Tour officials to postpone the Mexico Open until Labour Day weekend, which means there are no off-weeks between July 23 and the end of the season in late October.</p>
<p>Fritsch hopes that will induce some regulars to take time off, thus creating chances for him to restore his feel for competition and to erase what he described as mechanical, practice-?oriented thoughts that crept into his mind during the rounds he was playing.</p>
<p>During the <span class="companylink">BMW</span> Charity Pro-Am in South Carolina, he said, he hit the ball as well as he could for 48 holes, but failure to convert on the greens (97 putts) translated into failure to make the cut after the third round.</p>
<p>At home in Raleigh, he had a total of 116 putts, an average of 29 per round, which ranked 15th. That kind of improved feel on the greens during competition was what he had been seeking.</p>
<p>"I need to exercise every opportunity for every event that I get in," Fritsch said, "make sure that I'm prepared, that I'm never going to an event wishing that I had prepared better."</p>

</p>
<p>The start of the 2009 Canadian Tour has been a bit of a rocky road.</p>
<p>Seven events were scheduled but three in Mexico were postponed because of the H1N1 or swine flu. Those events -- San Luis Potosi Open, Yucatan Country Club Classic and the Iberostar Riviera Maya Open -- will likely be played in late September or early October when the Tour finalizes the dates.</p>
<p>The four events played have been totally dominated by golfers from Argentina. Rafael Gomez won the inaugural tournament on Nov. 24 at Santiago, Chile. In early December, Fabian Gomez captured the Argentine Masters in Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>Then it became the Mauricio Molina show with back-to-back victories in Costa Rica and at Mazatlan, Mexico. Molina is the Order of Merit leader (top money) with $40,570.69. He is followed by the Gomezes -- Rafael with $26,396.87 and Fabian at $22,545.75.</p>
<p>Molina will be bringing his game to the Uplands Golf Club for the $200,000 Times Colonist Open which begins on Thursday.</p>
<p>Daniel Im from Fullerton, Calif., is fourth on the Order of Merit ($16,314.17) and he will be back at Uplands trying to defend his title which he won in an extra-hole playoff against James Lepp from Abbotsford.</p>
<p>The top Canadian on the Order of Merit is Stuart Anderson, who now makes his home in Victoria. Anderson has won $15,412.45.</p>
<p>After the stop in Victoria -- the first Canadian tournament on the Tour -- the players will head to the $150,000 City of Surrey Invitational at the Hazelmere Country Club on June 11.</p>
<p>The Canadian portion of the schedule will wrap up with the Canadian Tour Championship on Aug. 31 at the St. Catharines Golf and Country Club. For those wanting or needing (to retain their cards) to play a little more golf, they can then head back to Mexico for the three postponed events.</p>

</p>
<p>Victoria's Jim Rutledge knows how to bring out a crowd.</p>
<p>At last year's Times Colonist Open, home-town favourite Rutledge had a huge following for each of his four rounds at Uplands Golf Club.</p>
<p>It also didn't hurt that Rutledge was in the hunt for his seventh Canadian Tour title until the 72nd and final hole on Sunday. Rutledge had a bogey on the hole that dropped him into third place, instead of a three-way tie for the lead with Daniel Im of Fullerton, Calif., and James Lepp from Abbotsford. Im captured the championship with a bogey on the first playoff hole. Rutledge will reach into his golf bag again on Thursday and try to find the right combination to win the Open crown. Many of the young players at Uplands will be trying to emulate Rutledge's march up the golf ladder. Two years ago, Rutledge had a taste of what life is like at the top when he earned a spot on the PGA Tour after finishing in the Top 25 of the Nationwide Tour. He has also spent many seasons on the Asian Tour.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to have Jim [Rutledge] coming back again this year,'' said Don Billsborough, head professional at Uplands. "He is such a great person and a fun player to watch.''</p>
<p>Established in 1984, the TC Open is the longest-running event on the Canadian Tour. The Open begins today at 7:30 a.m. with pro qualifying. That will be followed by the Pepsi Pro-Am qualifying at 2:30 p.m.</p>
<p>There is a Pro-Am tomorrow before a practice round on Wednesday. Then more than 150 pros will start shooting for a piece of the $200,000 pot on Thursday. The starting tee times for the opening two rounds are 7:30 a.m. After the cut is determined on Friday, the remaining players (the top 60 and ties) will be back on the course on Saturday and Sunday. The leaders will tee off each of those days at 1 p.m.</p>
<p>Before each of the players start their rounds on Thursday, they will be given a ribbon to honour the passing of Denis Racine, last year's TC Open tournament director.</p>
<p>There have been four events on the Tour so far this season and Uplands will be the first Canadian stop. In total, there will be 15 events and another three in Mexico were postponed because of the swine flu.</p>

<p>The Boy Scouts' motto "be prepared" is a sensible guide for small business owners to follow at all times. However, it is especially the case when planning for disasters of various types, including a possible flu pandemic.</p>
<p>There is of course no fool-proof protection against all disasters: Life is full of surprises and unless one goes off to live in a cave, stuff happens as the saying goes. Even then, as our early ancestors knew so well, one could encounter rock slides, hungry bears and the possibility of freezing to death if the fire went out.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is plenty that can be done to safeguard a business against events, such as the H1N1 strain of influenza, originally called Swine Flu. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business prepared a few suggestions we've been working to convey to small business owners on a broad basis. Here are some of the steps we feel can and should be taken: - Having the owner incapacitated and out of commission for an extended period can be as devastating as having the business burn to the ground. To prepare for this, have a written plan, discuss it with senior staff and file it in a safe place. The goal is to have your business operate as normally as possible without you. - Designate someone to take over your responsibilities such as managing staff and meeting with clients until you return. - The plan should include giving Power of Attorney to a trusted person who can make legal and financial decisions in your absence. - Make certain there is disability and business overhead insurance and review it every year. - Identify which elements of the business are essential to the maintenance of operations. Estimate the potential impact of personnel, supply and distribution disruptions resulting from a pandemic. Establish an emergency communications plan. - Hold drills to practice the plan as it's the best way to know if what is in place actually works. Also, it teaches employees what to do in case of an emergency. - Forecast and allow for employee absences due to illness, family member illness, community containment and quarantine measures, school and business closures and public transportation closures. Improve employee access to insurance and social services. Establish ways, if possible, to limit face-to-face contact between employees in the workplace. - Develop leave, return-to-work and travel policies unique to a pandemic. Staffing shifts and using technology can limit person-to-person spread of disease in the workplace. - Provide sanitizers, antibacterial soaps, tissues and waste receptacles. Double check that ventilation systems are running properly. Establish the availability of medical consultation. If you rent office or retail space try to get the landlord gear up cleaning procedures for the premises. If you are the landlord, you should attend to the matter yourself. - Provide updated, accurate materials covering basic pandemic flu facts and response strategies. Encourage good hygiene and coughing/sneezing etiquette. Provide home-care information to staff and family members. - Make firm arrangements with banks concerning lines of credit, etc. Exchange best practices with other businesses and understand the community's capabilities. - The many media outlets, especially the Internet provide a wealth of information that is constantly being updated. Advances in technology, have made it possible for employees to do their jobs away from the office -- an option that should be used to advantage when necessary.</p>
<p>Hopefully there will never be a crisis to trigger the implementation of these suggestions. Nevertheless, being prepared can't hurt. - Dan Kelly is senior vice-president of legislative affairs for the Canadian Federation of Independent business. He will take over writing this column from Garth Whyte, who has left CFIB. Kelly is based in Ottawa and has years of experience lobbying on behalf of CFIB's 105,000 members at the federal, provincial and municipal levels.</p>

</div><div>Debra Yeo   </div>

<div>848 words</div><div>1 June 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>E01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Slumdog Who?</p>
<p>It was all about the vampires at last night's MTV Movie Awards.</p>
<p>Twilight and Slumdog Millionaire went into the contest with a leading six nominations each, but Slumdog, which won eight Academy Award earlier this year, including Best Film, wasn't getting any love in LaLa Land this time around.</p>
<p>It was almost a clean sweep for Twilight, the popular movie about a romance between a teen vampire and a human girl based on the bestselling books by Stephenie Meyer.</p>
<p>Twilight took the Best Movie prize, as well as Best Male Breakthrough Performance, for heartthrob star Robert Pattinson; Best Female Performance for his leading lady, Kristen Stewart; Best Kiss for Pattinson and Stewart; and Best Fight Scene for Pattinson's dust-up with Cam Gigandet.</p>
<p>Its only miss was the Best Song From a Movie prize, which went to Miley Cyrus and "The Climb" from Hannah Montana: The Movie.</p>
<p>Other Best Movie contenders at the ceremony at the Gibson Amphitheatre in Universal City, Calif., were The Dark Knight, Iron Man and High School Musical 3: Senior Year.</p>
<p>The Dark Knight garnered the Best Villain trophy for Heath Ledger's Joker character, but the award wasn't presented on the air.</p>
<p>One of last night's show highlights was the airing of a trailer from Twilight sequel New Moon, with fans getting a look at Taylor Lautner transforming into a giant werewolf, as well as clips of Pattinson and Stewart.</p>
<p>But the most memorable moment belonged to a British comedian portraying a gay Austrian fashion reporter and one very angry American rapper.</p>
<p>Sacha Baron Cohen, in character as his alter ego Bruno, presented the award for Best Male Performance, which went to Zac Efron for his turn in High School Musical 3.</p>
<p>Cohen read his presentation suspended by wires, dressed in a pair of wings and a white bodysuit that left his butt cheeks exposed. After apparently crashing into an obstacle overhead, he came in for a landing right on top of rapper Eminem, with his legs around the rapper's neck and his rear end in his face.</p>
<p>The rapper had earlier performed a medley of songs from his comeback album, Relapse.</p>
<p>An extremely angry Eminem could be heard shouting, "Are you serious? Are you f -in' serious?" after Cohen's comedown. His bodyguards removed Cohen from his lap, and Eminem and the entire entourage walked out.</p>
<p>It wasn't the first time Eminem was the butt (no pun intended) of a joke at an MTV awards show. In 2002, sparks flew when the rapper was interviewed by Triumph the Insult Comic Dog at the MTV Video Music Awards.</p>
<p>But tastelessness wasn't confined to Cohen's antics.</p>
<p>The show also featured an opening montage by host Andy Samberg that had him inserted into various movies, including the outhouse scene from Slumdog Millionaire and the seduction scene from The Reader. It ended with Samberg climbing into a limo nude with singer Justin Timberlake, his co-star in the infamous "D - in a Box" video, and then climbing out of the car over top of a squeamish-looking Timberlake.</p>
<p>The presentation of the Best WTF Moment award - to Amy Poehler for her "peeing in a sink" scene in Baby Mama - featured a long string of bleeped-out swear words from Heroes star Hayden Panettiere.</p>
<p>And the presentation of the MTV Generation Award to Ben Stiller had him being mocked by Zac Efron, Kiefer Sutherland and Triumph the Insult Dog.</p>
<p>"Your name alone conjures up so many images, director, actor, writer, Jew and, of course, primate," said Triumph, adding that the MTV producers were "running out of both comedians and people who look like apes."</p>
<p>there wouldn't be a swine flu if we treated the pigs better Jim Carrey</p>

<div>Moose</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Ah, just grin and Bear it - It was a great Game 1 and Moose can bounce back</b>
</div><div>By Gary Lawless   </div>
<div>777 words</div><div>31 May 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Pour 13 years of non-final elixir, mix 15,003 parts of Canadian hockey fan, add one cup sweat of Moose plus chocolate Bear shavings and shake for three hours. The result: A froth of summer hockey capable of washing down a winter so devilish even the Swine Flu couldn't make Mexico look undesirable.</p>
<p>In the end the finish was a little bitter as the homeside Manitoba Moose blew a two-goal third period lead and fell 5-4 to the Hershey Bears in Game 1 of the Calder Cup Final.</p>
<p>It's the dizzying highs and lows of hockey played on the fringe of summer, however, that make it uncomparable and Moose fans were given a ride to remember despite an ending to forget.</p>
<p>All those long February nights of trudging downtown to watch hockey seemed worth it on this Saturday night as the Moose and Bears paid off this Game 1 record setting crowd with a dazzling display capped by Hershey's Alexandre Giroux scoring a power play goal at 13:33 of overtime to pop Manitoba's balloon.</p>
<p>Giroux's overtime winner was his third of the night and 12th of the post-season as the AHL's regular season leading scorer continues to baffle goalies.</p>
<p>For the Moose it's been 13 years of waiting to get on this stage and for Winnipeggers it's been more than twice that long at 30 years since a local group of hockey pros fought for a championship and all that bubbled up into a piece of theatre drenched in drama. Moose coach Scott Arniel saw his club take a 3-1 lead into the third frame before coughing up three straight goals to trail 4-3 in the late going. A power-play goal from Max Fortunus with just over a minute to go forced overtime but Arniel said the writing was on the wall for a while in this match.</p>
<p>"We had four turnovers in the first period and 15 in the second period. That's where our troubles started," said Arniel. "Our pain was self-inflicted. We had a number of guys that didn't bring their A-game. We have to be better."</p>
<p>The Bears have now reversed home-ice advantage and following Tuesday's Game 2 at the MTS Centre, will have three games in a row in their own building should they need that many.</p>
<p>"The first two games, when you're on the road you want to at least get one win," said Bears coach Bob Woods.</p>
<p>"But they'll be desperate on Tuesday and we'll have to match their level of intensity. This is going to be a long series. We did our job in this game but there's lots to go."</p>
<p>Manitoba hit the first paydirt of the series as crafty Mark Cullen, quietly one of the best of the Moose so far in these playoffs, buried his fourth goal off a backdoor pass from centre Jason Krog on a first period 5-on-3 power play.</p>
<p>The lead was short-lived as the Moose quickly realized the Bears duo of Giroux and Keith Aucoin will bite if given the chance.</p>
<p>The duo broke down the ice short-handed and after some confusion in the Manitoba zone, Giroux scooped up the puck and rifled it behind Moose goalie Cory Schneider for a 1-1 score with the period not quite half over.</p>
<p>Having not played each other all regular season the two clubs have a little to find out about one another and Moose dragster Michael Grabner opened Hershey eyes with a doozy to make it 2-1 at 13:18 of the first. Rookie Cody Hodgson found the puck in front of the Manitoba bench and zipped a pass to Grabner and the Austrian assasin took it in full flight before skirting a Hershey defender and roofing a backhand over goalie Michal Neuvirth.</p>
<p>Grabner added a second before the second was over for a 3-1 Moose edge and the home club seemed firmly in control.</p>
<p>The Bears made their push getting a pair of goals from Oscar Osala and another from Griouix to put the visitors in front.</p>
<p>"We knew they were going to come. I don't know why we didn't push back," said Moose winger Jason Jaffray.</p>
<p>"We watched the film, they trailed in a lot of their games against Providence (Bruins) and always came back."</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>The region has two more confirmed cases of the H1N1 flu virus, bringing the total to four, the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health board reported yesterday. The latest victims are an eight-year-old girl from Guelph and a Dufferin County man, 27.</p>
<p>The virus "causes a similar illness to the seasonal influenza that we experience every winter," local medical officer of health Dr. Nicola Mercer, said in a release. There are now 626 known cases in Ontario, The Canadian Press reported yesterday afternoon. Six of these people are in hospital. The World Health Organization yesterday put the global figure at more than 15,500 incidents, including 99 deaths. Almost 13,000 of those cases are in the U.S. and Mexico.</p>

</p>
<p>A family member recently had occasion to witness first-hand the workings of the local cancer centre in Kitchener, with positive results, thankfully. We found the centre to be staffed by a very competent, caring, compassionate group of professionals.</p>
<p>What was of most concern to us every time we were in was how busy the facility appeared. We were told by a friendly volunteer that every day the centre is open, it deals with 10 to 12 new cases of cancer of some form or other. That means 50 to 60 new cases every week. How many cases of H1N1 flu have there been in the area?</p>
<p>Our family, for one, is very thankful that we have such a wonderful facility in our midst. How nice it would be to think that some day soon it will not be nearly as busy as it is now.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Can your firm handle a disaster?; Most companies lack contingency plans, say experts</b>
</div><div>Derek Sankey   </div>
<div>For The Calgary Herald</div>
<div>745 words</div><div>30 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>It's human nature. It is only when some type of disaster or emergency occurs that people look at how prepared they are to endure it and respond to it. Many times, that's too late.</p>
<p>The same appears to hold true for corporations, which have had all kinds of challenges thrown at them this year, the latest of which was the need for pandemic planning as a result of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"When there is a disaster, then people start realizing," says Bob Klay, president of Klay Information Management Consulting Ltd.</p>
<p>But when companies are cutting costs or downsizing, preparing for any disaster--whether it's a pandemic, a natural disaster or any other disruption to business --tends to fall way down the list of priorities.</p>
<p>Craig Wilson, a strategic communications consultant for Avaya Canada, says too often corporations focus on only the technology aspect of contingency planning.</p>
<p>"A lot of companies are focused (on) business continuity from an IT perspective," he says, adding natural disasters and other emergencies are overlooked.</p>
<p>"Its financial impact can be much more huge, but unfortunately people are much more familiar with server failures and so see those as much more pressing," he says.</p>
<p>With the recent concern about a potential pandemic, Klay says many employers just sent out e-mails with links to places such as the World Health Organization. It's a start, but lacks much of a plan.</p>
<p>"The problem is that if you're an employee . . . it doesn't address the effect," says Klay.</p>
<p>"Most continuity plans lack depth," he says. "They do scenario-based planning based on having no access to the building. That's certainly a very good start, but . . . I believe the biggest key in all planning is the awareness, the maintenance and ongoing communication about it."</p>
<p>The communication can't be a monologue. There is nothing more important than having a two-way line of communication open involving direct feedback from employees.</p>
<p>It's also not about fearmongering, he insists.</p>
<p>"What we need to do is get rid of arrogance," he says. When business leaders dismiss science and the reality it's not a matter of if, but when, then there are bound to be negative consequences.</p>
<p>"You really have to look at your essential services, critical processes and functions and how well your people are supported, trained and how they can sustain a blow," says Klay.</p>
<p>By giving employees this kind of training and a thorough understanding of a company's comprehensive contingency plan, they are more likely to respond rationally instead of out of panic.</p>
<p>Wilson was speaking at a recent conference and he asked the crowd of about 50 business leaders if they had a practised pandemic response plan. Less than a quarter put up their hand.</p>
<p>Aside from cutbacks, Wilson says another major barrier to developing a sound disaster plan is the very nature of how companies operate.</p>
<p>"In a very short term-focused market economy, this stuff doesn't seem to give you the wide return on investment," he says.</p>
<p>Wilson argues, however, that implementing many of the programs and backup plans that should be part of any good disaster plan actually do have payoffs.</p>
<p>"This brings together legal, HR, compensation, your communications team, what you say to shareholders as much as what you say to customers and employees," says Wilson. "It is really a very broad-based . . . strategy to put together."</p>
<p>He refers to it as enterprise resilience and says it goes far beyond paying insurance premiums.</p>
<p>"Being enterprise resilient isn't just an insurance policy," he says. "It's a method of becoming very nimble and certainly that's what you have to be these days if you're going to survive and grow," says Wilson.</p>
<p>It should not be approached merely as risk mitigation, but rather as steps you can take to ensure your business is more sustainable and able to respond quickly and effectively to whatever is thrown your way.</p>
<p>Wilson and Klay doubt there would be much tolerance for a company that simply closes down shop until whatever event passes. "You cannot just abolish the company," says Klay.</p>

</p>
<p>Burlington's first case of H1N1 influenza is in an elementary school close to Oakville where most of the cases in Halton Region are concentrated.</p>
<p>The school, St. Patrick Catholic school in east Burlington, issued a letter from the Halton health department to parents Thursday informing them of the confirmed case and also that the student has already recovered.</p>
<p>Of Halton's 70 cases as of yesterday, 54 are students in 20 elementary or high school schools.</p>
<p>Three of the students were hospitalized but none remain in hospital, having recovered or become well enough to recover at home.</p>
<p>Four of the cases were just confirmed yesterday and none are seriously ill, according to Halton Medical Officer Bob Nosal.</p>
<p>Nosal said it is appears the human swine flu is affecting primarily children and teens because they have had no exposure to any similar virus.</p>
<p>"It is felt that people born before 1957 may have been exposed to a similar type of virus and may have developed some immunity."</p>
<p>Also, the fact students are in close contact and interacting daily means they are catching H1N1 just as they do seasonal influenza, he said.</p>
<p>Heightened awareness of the virus may be causing more parents to take their children to the doctor and getting them tested.</p>
<p>Over 300 samples from across Ontario are being sent daily to the provincial lab for testing, Nosal said.</p>
<p>Nosal expects more cases in Halton as the virus continues to spread. With yesterday's Burlington case, the region now has cases in each its four municipalities.</p>
<p>None of the affected people in Halton had travelled outside the country, nor were they in contact with anyone who travelled, making it difficult to trace where and how it first appeared in Halton.</p>
<p>Nosal said it may be that the first cases may have had contact with someone they didn't know had been out of the country, or who didn't know they carried the virus because their symptoms were mild.</p>
<p>The predominant Oakville cases could be related to that community's proximity to Toronto, which has about half of the province's 626 cases so far.</p>
<p>Hamilton's cases remains at five.</p>
<p>Nosal said usual influenzas die down with warmer weather, but with H1N1 being so novel, "we really don't know if it'll be seasonal."</p>

</p>
<p>Saskatchewan's H1N1 flu numbers climbed into three-digit territory on Friday.</p>
<p>The Health Ministry said 123 cases have been confirmed in the province during the past several weeks, up from 91 last Monday.</p>
<p>Health officials say the new flu strain has caused only mild illness in most of the Canadian cases. But the medical community is keeping an eye on the flu strain to see if it changes during flu season into something that causes more serious illness.</p>
<p>The Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region has seen 25 confirmed cases and the Saskatoon Health Region has recorded 86.</p>
<p>Proper hand-washing and respiratory etiquette -- such as coughing into the crook of your elbow -- are touted as flu prevention measures. Symptoms reflect those of any seasonal flu, such as fever, cough and body aches.</p>

<p>Health officials around the world battled Friday to stop the spread of swine flu with schools in Europe closed, as global infections passed the 15,000-mark and more countries announced first cases.</p>
<p>And China reported its first case of domestic infection.</p>

<p>Companies are starting preliminary work on a vaccine for the new H1N1 flu and should begin clinical trials in the coming months, but the new vaccine would not be ready for widespread use until October, U.S. health officials said Thursday. Although new to humans, they said, the H1N1 strain appears to be behaving very much like a seasonal H1N1 flu in striking more children and young people. So far, there have been 8,585 probable and confirmed U.S. cases of the new H1N1 strain, commonly called swine flu, with 12 deaths and 507 hospitalizations, Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Researchers hope to study how Olympics affect public health; Project is one of several potential Games-related studies</b>

<div>480 words</div><div>29 May 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Public health researchers are hoping the 2010 Olympics will give them valuable insight into the effect a mega-event like the Vancouver Games can have on a population.</p>
<p>They're not wishing for a disaster, but they are looking at how events such as the Olympics can dramatically affect public health, whether it's a communicable disease like the H1N1 flu, the pressure on a hospital system of a mass-casualty accident, or the prolonged effects of traffic-related air pollution.</p>
<p>Until now, researchers for the most part haven't developed ideas about how to use the Vancouver Games to scientifically explore those effects.</p>
<p>Today, however, more than 90 institution-based scientists hope to map out at least half a dozen research projects they want to conduct around the 2010 Games.</p>
<p>The potential projects will be discussed in a symposium organized by the B.C. Environmental and Occupational Health Research Network.</p>
<p>Tim Takaro, a health sciences researcher at Simon Fraser University and workshop coordinator, said the network will award half a dozen seed grants of about $10,000 each for a variety of Olympic-related projects.</p>
<p>Health research around the Olympics isn't a new concept, and some major events, such as the 1996 Atlanta and 2008 Beijing Summer Games are still being studied.</p>
<p>New findings will be presented at the conference on air pollution studies in Beijing and reduced respiratory problems during the Atlanta Games as a result of traffic restrictions.</p>
<p>With several hundred thousand visitors expected to be in Vancouver, the Olympics provides a rare study opportunity, Takaro said.</p>
<p>"There's an opportunity to look at the social phenomenon, the infections/disease phenomenon, flu, air pollution and the effects of travel, as well as the effects of restricting travel," he said.</p>
<p>"All of those things are natural experiments that pertain to public health because they relate to exposures."</p>
<p>Most of the research will involve studies conducted before, during and after the Games, he said. Some, such as an examination of air quality, could take upwards of a year after the Games to be completed.</p>
<p>Ultimately the findings will all be given to universities, governments and the International Olympic Committee.</p>
<p>"I would hope what will come from this is to help cities plan traffic-free zones, for example, or plan better where to site schools, businesses and residences," Takaro said.</p>
<p>"I am hoping it contributes to the province's ability to track infectious disease, to prepare for the next pandemic, or to plan for surge capacity in hospital emergency rooms."</p>
<p>The network was set up in 2005 with a large grant from the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research.</p>

<p>The number of cases of the new H1N1 flu virus in Ottawa has hit 21, according to public-health officials. If, as expected, the new cases are confirmed by the province today, the latest figures would bring the total number of reported cases in Ontario to 500. Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's medical officer of health, said public-health officials are tracking the outbreak by monitoring rates of absenteeism in schools, nursing homes and other institutions. "We have had some reports of potential clusters that we are following up," Levy said.</p>

<p>If you ask a random group of 100 recent airline passengers, I am sure the majority of them can share one horrific story or other. Cancelled flights. Lost luggage. Sitting on the tarmac for hours. We've all heard them.</p>
<p>Bill C-310-- which was the subject of criticism in the Post's recent Flight Rights series -- was introduced to Parliament in February, passed its first vote by 139 to 131 and earlier this month was accepted for further study by the transportation committee. It includes clear measures on compensation for overbooked flights and cancellations. It is only fair that the airlines either stop overbooking or start compensating people when they could miss a cruise ship connection, wedding or funeral because the airline tells them, at the last minute, that they cannot have a seat that they already paid for.</p>
<p>Bill C-310 is fair for airlines and passengers. Recently, airlines cancelled flights to Mexico and refused to refund tickets. Under Bill C-310, airlines would have to refund the money but would not have to pay extra compensation because the cause of the cancelation, H1N1 ("swine flu"), is considered an extraordinary circumstance beyond the airlines' control.</p>
<p>No compensation is payable for flight delays beyond meal vouchers after two hours and hotels for overnight stays. However, the bill enables passengers to get a full refund if the delay exceeds five hours. This is a significant improvement.</p>
<p>Since 2005, all Air Canada passengers traveling in Europe have been eligible for $500, $800 or $1,200 compensation (depending on the length of the flight) for overbooked or cancelled flights. Why does Air Canada refuse to give the same passenger coverage in Canada?</p>
<p>Bill C-310 provides compensation for tarmac delays over one hour. Even the Canadian Airline Council agrees that passengers should not be held prisoner on planes or warehoused on tarmacs beyond 90 minutes. But they don't want to pay any compensation.</p>
<p>Bill C-310 allows passengers to disembark after one hour, only if it is safe to do so. The bill also highlights concerns over late and misplaced luggage, and all-inclusive pricing by airline companies in their advertising. It is important for customers to see the airlines' full cost for a ticket, clearly including taxes and all other surcharges.</p>
<p>The bill of rights will ensure that passengers are kept informed of flight changes, whether they are delays or cancellations. The new rules will be posted in the airport and airlines will be required to inform passengers of their rights and the process for filing for compensation.</p>
<p>These changes are not meant to punish the airlines. If they follow the rules, they will not have to pay one dime to travellers.</p>
<p>Canada already has some customer service regulations, but they are hidden in legal jargon that is nearly impossible to understand. Bill C-310 will make it clear to average people how to get any compensation they deserve.</p>
<p>Customers must be treated better than cargo. This bill will ensure that they are. - Jim Maloway is the New Democratic Party of Canada's Member of Parliament for Elmwood-Transcona, Manitoba.</p>

</p>
<p>The Toronto District School Board early yesterday postponed a decision on reprimanding trustee Josh Matlow, pictured, amid signs of a split on the board. Trustees Sheila Ward and Irene Atkinson brought forward a motion, claiming that Mr. Matlow's public criticism of the board's handling of a suspected case of swine flu at a local school "fanned the flames of fear and panic." The motion accuses Mr. Matlow of damaging the board's reputation and called upon him to "cease and desist his destructive behaviour." "This is not about muzzling trustees," said Ms. Ward, trustee for Toronto Centre-Rosedale. Trustee Stephnie Payne countered: "This is ridiculous. This gang mentality around this boardroom has to stop." In the end, with the meeting gone past midnight, the board put the matter off until its next meeting in June.</p>

<p>GLOBAL AIR TRAVEL GRADUALLY PICKING UP SPEED</p>
<p>The global slide in air travel slowed for the first time in seven months in April as declines in European and North America markets eased.</p>
<p>Passenger traffic fell 3.1 per cent from a year earlier, compared with an 11-per-cent drop in March, the International Air Transport Association said today. The decline was 2.7 per cent in Europe, down from 11.7 per cent, and 4.2 per cent in North America, versus 13.4 per cent a month earlier.</p>
<p>"We have not yet seen any signs that recovery is imminent. We are not out of the woods yet."said Giovanni Bisignani, chief executive officer of Montreal- and Geneva-based IATA, in a statement.</p>
<p>With airlines cutting capacity by only 2.5 per cent, the average load factor, a measure of seat occupancy, slipped to 74.4 per cent from 75.4 per cent a year earlier. That was still an improvement on the March figure of 72.1 per cent, according to IATA, which represents 230 airlines responsible for 93 per cent of scheduled international air traffic.</p>
<p>April figures were boosted at least 2 per cent by leisure travel related to the Easter holiday, which fell in March in 2008, IATA said.</p>
<p>The global outbreak of swine flu came in the last week of the month and had little impact on April figures, spokesman Tony Concil said.</p>
<p>Airlines have seen no improvement in revenue as yields -- a measure of average fares -- continue to fall, Bisignani said. Preliminary data for May also suggests a renewed "double-digit decline" in traffic, at least for European airlines, he said.</p>
<p>Asia-Pacific carriers continued to see the most significant deterioration, with an 8.6-per-cent drop in traffic, while Middle Eastern demand rose 11 per cent, IATA said.</p>
<p>OPEC CUT NOT NEEDED</p>
<p>VIENNA - Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said OPEC doesn't need to cut production further because demand is starting to recover.</p>
<p>Naimi, who sets policy in the world's largest oil exporter, expects prices to rise to $75 US this year as Asian crude imports begin rising again.</p>
<p>Oil has gained 41 per cent this year in New York, reaching a six-month high above $63 US Wednesday, on optimism the global economy will soon revive, boosting fuel demand.</p>
<p>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets Thursday to decide whether to alter output quotas.</p>
<p>POULTRY SALES UP IN 2008</p>
<p>OTTAWA - The value of all poultry products sold in Canada increased 13.1 per cent in 2008 from the previous year, for a value of $3.2 billion, Statistics Canada said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sales of poultry meat, including turkey, made up the lion's share of the total, at $2.4 billion, a 15-per-cent increase over 2007.</p>
<p>Egg sales increased 7.9 per cent to $823 million.</p>
<p>Canadian poultry farms produced 1.2 million metric tonnes of poultry meat in 2008 -- 85 per cent of which was chicken -- and 579.9 million dozen eggs.</p>
<p>DRILLER SEES SLOW SUMMER</p>
<p>TORONTO - <span class="companylink">Precision Drilling Trust</span>, Canada's largest oil-well driller, is bracing for a continuation of a slump caused by low commodity prices.</p>
<p>"It looks like a lousy summer for drilling," chief executive Kevin Neveu said at a conference in Toronto.</p>
<p>"The only difference between this downturn and other downturns is customers are running through their contracts."</p>
<p>Precision has about 18 rigs that are idle and fully paid for under contracts, Neveu said.</p>
<p>The Calgary-based company has 26 rigs drilling in Canada and about 100 running in North America.</p>
<p>Precision has been able to keep rigs operating profitably because the company negotiated the prices on many contracts at 2008 rates, he said.</p>
<p>TIMMINCO LOSES CUSTOMER</p>
<p>VANCOUVER - <span class="companylink">Timminco Ltd</span>. and an unnamed customer for solar-grade silicon have agreed to end a supply agreement, Timminco said on Wednesday, blaming difficult economic conditions.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, announced in December 2007, Timminco was scheduled to ship approximately 4,400 tonnes of silicon to the customer over a five-year period.</p>
<p>Toronto-based Timminco said it will issue 3.62 million shares, equal to about three per cent of shares outstanding, to settle the customer's deposit of $5.6 million.</p>
<p>ZENN POSTS WIDER LOSS</p>
<p>VANCOUVER - Electric carmaker Zenn Motor Co. posted a slightly wider second-quarter net loss as the downturn in the automotive sector hurt its revenue.</p>
<p>For the quarter ended March 31, Toronto-based Zenn reported a net loss of $2 million, compared with a loss of $1.8 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Gross revenue fell 47 per cent to $391,227.</p>
<p>"Revenue in the quarter reflects the general malaise of the auto industry," said chief executive Ian Clifford.</p>
<p>TECK IN TALKS TO SELL ASSETS</p>
<p>BEIJING - <span class="companylink">Teck Resources Ltd</span>., Canada's biggest base-metals company, is in talks to sell coking-coal assets to Chinese companies to help reduce debt.</p>
<p>"We are going through a process" of talks with Chinese companies, including steelmakers, to buy as much as a 20-per-cent stake in its coking coal business, chief executive Donald Lindsay said in Beijing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>When asked, he declined to name the companies.</p>
<p>STAPLES PROFIT BEATS ESTIMATES</p>
<p>NEW YORK - Top office products retailer <span class="companylink">Staples Inc</span>. reported slightly higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday, bolstered by its Corporate Express unit.</p>
<p>Staples, which bought Corporate Express in July, said it still expected to save up to $300 million US in costs from the acquisition of its Dutch rival.</p>
<p>Net earnings fell to $147 million US, or 20 cents a share, in the first quarter that ended May 2 from $212.2 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier, while sales rose 19 per cent to $5.82 billion.</p>
<p>GLOBE UNIONS OK COST CUTS</p>
<p>NEW YORK - Two Boston Globe unions approved contracts that would save its publisher about $7.2 million US annually and bring the money-losing newspaper closer to preventing its shutdown.</p>
<p>A "slim" majority of the 92 active members of the Boston Newspaper Printing Pressmen's Union No. 3 voted in favour of the contract, which includes pay cuts and other concessions, said union president Martin Callaghan.</p>
<p>He declined to give specifics of the contract, which will save parent <span class="companylink">New York Times Co</span>. about $2.2 million US.</p>
<p>Teamsters Local 1 approved a contract for about 250 members with $5 million in cost cuts.</p>
<p>DOREL BRACED FOR PINCH</p>
<p>MONTREAL - <span class="companylink">Dorel Industries</span> assured shareholders attending Wednesday's annual meeting in Montreal that the company expects to feel the pinch, but still fare reasonably well during the current economic crisis.</p>
<p>"Our price points fit the times," said company president Martin Schwartz.</p>
<p>Many of Dorel's juvenile products, bicycles and furniture products fall into the mid-price range that appeals to consumers and retailers, he said.</p>
<p>As a result, the company is picking up more retail customers who are looking for a stable supplier with a long history.</p>
<p>U.S. HOME SALES UP IN APRIL</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - Sales of existing homes in the United States rose 2.9 per cent in April, according to an industry survey on Wednesday that supported views that nation's three-year housing recession was nearing the bottom.</p>
<p>The National Association of Realtors said sales climbed to an annual rate of 4.68 million from a 4.55-million pace in March.</p>
<p>That number was just slightly higher than market expectations for a 4.66 million-unit pace.</p>
<p>During the month, single-family home sales rose 2.5 per cent to an annual rate of 4.18 million, while condos jumped 6.4 per cent to a 500,000 annual pace.</p>
<p>Home sales were up in three of the four regions.</p>

<p>A cruise ship carrying more than 2,000 passengers sailed back to Mexico's Caribbean coast on Wednesday, the tourism ministry said, as the country's swine flu death toll rose to 89.</p>
<p>Mexico's Tourism Minister Rodolfo Elizondo welcomed the ship from the Royal Caribbean company at Cozumel island a month after the H1N1 outbreak caused cruise liners, airlines and tour companies to stay away from the country.</p>

<p>Wolverine wolf whistle</p>
<p>Hugh Jackman's nine-year-old son is using his dad's Wolverine pedigree to woo the girls.</p>
<p>Jackman says his son Oscar, spotting a group of teenage girls one day, turned to him and said, "Hey dad, 2 o'clock, hot chicks."</p>
<p>The Australian actor, chosen People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive for 2008, says the conversation made him squirm. But Jackman says his son marched right up to the girls and declared "Hey, you know that my dad's Wolverine?"</p>
<p>Jackman spoke to reporters Tuesday while in Mexico City to promote X-Men Origins: Wolverine. The film's Mexican première was delayed because of the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>No Relapse for Eminem</p>
<p>Eminem's new album, Relapse, has sold more copies in its first week of release than any other album this year.</p>
<p>Nielsen SoundScan says the Detroit rapper's first album in nearly five years sold 608,000 copies.</p>
<p>Relapse is Eminem's fifth straight No. 1 album. His last disc, 2004's Encore, sold 711,000 in its first week -- though that was across only four days. It went on to sell 5.1 million copies.</p>
<p>Last week's chart topper, Green Day's 21st Century Breakdown, slid to No. 2, adding 166,000 copies sold to the 215,000 copies the band sold in its initial, abbreviated three-day sales week.</p>
<p>Kate and A-Rod burning up the phone lines</p>
<p>Kate Hudson is making "sexy late-night phone calls" to Alex (A-Rod) Rodriguez.</p>
<p>The Bride Wars actress and the New York Yankees baseball star -- who were recently spotted kissing at New York's Mustang Grill restaurant -- are spicing up their fledgling relationship with steamy phone sessions.</p>
<p>New York Daily News newspaper reports: "Although Hudson is currently filming in Oklahoma, she and A-Rod keep their new love alive with sexy late-night phone calls." Alex, 33, and his estranged wife, Cynthia -- with whom he raises two daughters -- split last year after she claimed he had "an affair of the heart" with Hung Up singer Madonna.</p>
<p>Kate, 30 -- who raises son Ryder, 5, with her ex-husband Chris Robinson -- was recently linked to her on/off ex-boyfriend Owen Wilson.</p>
<p>However, friends of Kate and Alex insist they are smitten with each other.</p>
<p>One pal said: "When she hits Yankee Stadium, she sits in A-Rod's private seats. They're giddy when they're together."</p>
<p>Perry makes a convert of her Gym Class Hero</p>
<p>Katy Perry's boyfriend is dating her because she has big breasts.</p>
<p>The Waking Up In Vegas singer is convinced her impressive assets won over Gym Class Heroes frontman Travis McCoy.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old star said: "I'm probably going to get in trouble for saying this, but Travis said he was never a boob guy -- he was always a butt guy -- until he met me." Katy admits she only recently realized the effect her womanly figure has on men.</p>
<p>"I didn't know how to use my curves growing up."</p>
<p>Pals advice to Aniston: ditch Pitt's number</p>
<p>Jennifer Aniston is being urged to cut Brad Pitt out of her life.</p>
<p>Her friends are worried Aniston will never get over her ex-husband if she doesn't distance herself from him.</p>
<p>A source said: "It's not that Courteney Cox and co. dislike Brad -- quite the opposite. They're all fond of him because he's a pleasant guy to be around.</p>
<p>"But that's the very reason why he can't be in Jennifer's life -- Courteney has told her repeatedly to ditch Brad's number. But it's never going to be that simple -- he was her one big love."</p>
<p>Madonna tells Britney take your kids on tour,</p>
<p>Britney Spears has been taking parenting advice from Madonna.</p>
<p>The Toxic singer has revealed she consulted her idol -- who raises three children -- when deciding whether or not to take her young sons, Sean Preston, 3, and Jayden James, 2, on tour with her. A source said: "Madonna told her, 'Keep them close when you're on the road. I have always taken my kids on the road with me. It's a life they learn to accept, as long as they're with their mom. You want to look back on those years and know they are with you. They'll look back on these years too and they'll be very glad to have those memories."</p>
<p>Britney is accompanied on her Britney Spears Presents the Circus tour by her sons and ex-husband Kevin Federline, who has primary custody of the children.</p>
<p>Brolin gets a taste of New Orleans women</p>
<p>Josh Brolin has reportedly been spotted "kissing" and "nibbling" a woman in New Orleans.</p>
<p>According to In Touch Weekly magazine, the married 41-year-old actor was seen getting close to a local woman in the Royal Street Inn on May 21, during a break from filming his new movie Jonah Hex.</p>
<p>Brolin -- whose wife is actress Diane Lane -- was seen talking to several women, a source said. "He was hugging them and seemed to enjoy all of the female attention he received for hours."</p>
<p>A woman identified as Melissa Green left with Brolin and was taken to a "private location."</p>
<p>They were spotted leaving the site at 7:23 the following morning.</p>
<p>Plain Jane Mariah more relaxed</p>
<p>Mariah Carey's nose "ate away" her face in her new movie.</p>
<p>The Hero singer had to don prosthetic features for her role as a dowdy social worker in Precious but suffered an intense allergic reaction to the materials used to create it.</p>
<p>"We tried to do a prosthetic nose but it started to make me break out so we had to rip it off," she said. "After that I was all red and swollen. I have such sensitive skin that it started to eat away all my face. It was like, 'I won't be doing this'.</p>
<p>"But it did have an effect on my look in the film, unglamorous, not pretty at all."</p>
<p>Carey, 40, recently revealed she struggled so much with the unglamorous role she landed herself in trouble with the film's director after he caught her trying to put on makeup.</p>
<p>"It was tough. I am so used to the music world which is so different with the cameras, the lighting, the angles and this and that," said Carey.</p>
<p>However, Carey soon got used to shunning her usual beauty regime and says the movie has left her more relaxed about her looks.</p>
<p>Nickelback leads MMV pack</p>
<p>Nickelback and R&B singer Danny Fernandes are the leading nominees for next month's MuchMusic Video Awards with five nods each.</p>

<p>The Jonas Brothers will perform and host the June 21 show, known for its street-party atmosphere outside MuchMusic headquarters on Toronto's Queen Street West.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga, who received two nominations, is the only other performer announced so far.</p>
<p>Fernandes and Nickelback will battle it out for video of the year, along with k-os, Marianas Trench and the Stills, who received two nominations.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>When Toronto 2015 chairman David Peterson delivers the Pan Am Games bid book today in Mexico City, it means the race for the 42-nation showcase is getting serious.</p>
<p>"We're all friends in the competition but we're prepared to work harder than anyone to win," the former Ontario premier said as he set off to deliver the six-pound bid book to Mario Vazquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports Organization, or PASO.</p>
<p>The document was originally due in late April but the outbreak of H1N1 influenza in Mexico put off delivery. The scare touched tragically close to Rana, whose grandchild was one of the first victims.</p>
<p>Miguel Tejada Vazquez, not yet two, was the youngest child of Vazquez Rana's daughter, Miriam. He was with family on a trip to Texas and died in a Houston hospital April 27.</p>
<p>The bid group already sent condolences, but Peterson will offer them in person today.</p>
<p>He said yesterday bid staff are guarding against complacency and pressing the bid at every opportunity.</p>
<p>"I'll get on a plane and go anywhere if it's just to talk to one person. Heck, our people are on planes half the time."</p>
<p>The next big opportunity to meet several of the voting delegates is in July at the Caribbean Games in Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
<p>On the domestic front, Toronto 2015 is involved in the June 11 Festival of Excellence at the University of Toronto. It will feature Olympic star Usain Bolt and other world-class sprinters and hurdlers.</p>
<p>Peterson said he expected evaluation teams to visit sometime in August. They will look at the sites for Hamilton's stadium and velodrome to see if they are feasible.</p>
<p>The last big opportunity to woo delegates is in early October when the International Olympic Committee meets in Copenhagen, Denmark, to vote on the 2016 Summer Games site.</p>
<p>Then the PASO annual congress is in Guadalajara, Mexico -- the 2011 Games host -- the first week of November, with the 2015 vote punctuating events.</p>
<p>There are 42 countries in PASO, but 52 votes. That's because countries that have held Games, such as Canada, get two votes.</p>

<p>A Halton student hospitalized with a severe case of H1N1 influenza is improving, as the number of cases in the region continues to rise.</p>
<p>Two new cases, one in a new school, were reported yesterday, bringing the total in Halton to 62. Ontario has 495 confirmed cases. Hamilton reported one new case yesterday, bringing its total to five -- all with mild symptoms.</p>
<p>In Halton, 48 of the 62 cases are students from 18 schools, 15 in Oakville. Three of the students were hospitalized but only the one remains in hospital, said Halton Medical Officer of Health Dr. Bob Nosal. In Ontario, six people are hospitalized so far.</p>
<p>Ontario's acting Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams said the jump of 143 new cases since Monday in the province is partly due to increased capacity for lab tests and the processing of a backlog of tests on the weekend.</p>

</p>
<p>BILLY JOEL AND ELTON JOHN</p>
<p>at the Air Canada Centre</p>
<p>in Toronto on Tuesday</p>
<p>On stage there were two vintage grands – and their pianos were there too. Billy Joel and Elton John are the human jukeboxes of the Face 2 Face tour, a four-handed package that has enjoyed unparalleled success since its first shows back in 1994. Unless Little Richard hits the road with Jesus and Nat King Cole, the piano-pairing box-office records of Joel & John will be hard to beat. But of the model-marrying New Yorker and the Canadian-marrying British knight, who wins between them? At the end of a stunning, 31/2-hour hit parade (that returns to ACC on Saturday), who's still standing?</p>
<p>Head to Head</p>
<p>An introductory four-song set had two famous, squat men sitting at their long, black instruments, some eight feet apart. The two didn't actually look at each other, lest their eyes meet as they traded unmanly lines about “how wonderful life is while you're in the world” and “I want you just the way you are.” Four songs are done duet-style; John's enthusiastic baritone was a bit frayed on Joel's My Life; Billy's tenor was warmed up already on Elton's Your Song.</p>
<p>John, 62, was lavishly attired in a long, gaudy coat; his contemporary blond toupée has aged well. Bald Joel, 60, dressed as if on Toronto's Bay Street, which he fairly was. The Englishman won the opening set – he had us at the rumbling descending notes of Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me, a sweeping, grandiose ballad that Joel's repertoire had no answer for.</p>
<p>BY THE NUMBERS</p>
<p>• A beer-line poll revealed that six of the 18,000 fans came for both the main attractions, that four came for John, and that only one made the trip to see Joel. “He's lucky he's here with Elton,” one woman cracked.</p>
<p>• A busy merchandise vendor said he was selling slightly more Rocket Man CDs than copies of The Stranger. One of his T-shirts reads “Billy + Elton = Heaven,” but a ticket stub argues that Joel plus John adds up to $277.50 (including two bucks for charity).</p>
<p>• Songs and sets are split almost evenly: 17 John numbers, 16 Joel tunes, and two rockers from Paul McCartney – Birthday and Back in the U.S.S.R, done during an encore.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN FANTASTIC</p>
<p>John's music is more ambitious than his counterpart's. Funeral for a Friend/ Love Lies Bleeding is an epic, progressive piece that, when released in 1973, should have warned people of the man's theatre-score ambitions. John boogied and woogied on the high-octane Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting. Burn Down the Mission had a soulful, southern-rock feel, while Madman Across the Water, from 1971, sprawled like Stevie Winwood's Traffic. The affecting Tiny Dancer wonderfully rhymed “ballerina” with “you must have seen-a,” the soaring ballad Rocket Man blew the roof off, and Crocodile Rock had socks a-hoppin'. If T-shirts were boasts, John's would read “I'm a tough act to follow, and if you don't believe me, just ask Billy Joel.”</p>
<p>HE'S NO STRANGER</p>
<p>Reacting to John's robust set, Joel opened his own with muscular versions of Angry Young Man and Movin' Out (Anthony's Song). Where John was not much for banter, Joel was gregarious, mentioning the duo's 2003 ACC concert (cancelled because of the SARS outbreak), and joking that he was now bringing the swine flu. Unlike John's material, songs like the working-class Allentown tell stories. John's playing was bluesy; Joel's Zanzibar was Steely Dan-jazzy. She's Always a Woman to Me had an audience in Joel's sway.</p>
<p>THE PIANO MEN</p>
<p>Going into the encore set, the two pop icons were even enough. Joel added high harmony on John's Candle in the Wind ode. The madman from across the water stole the shout-along rocker You May Be Right, but the telling blow came at the concert's finale: John sang the line “it's me they've been comin' to see” on Piano Man, Joel smiling as it happened on his own signature song. He had played piano, guitar and rack harmonica, and now he had graciously added second fiddle to his list.</p>
<p>Billy Joel and Elton John play ACC again on Saturday; Ottawa, June 1; Montreal, June 3; and Buffalo, July 24.</p>

<p>The 62-year-old driver of the Pontiac was pronounced dead at the scene. The 49-year-old driver of the other car was sent to hospital with serious injuries.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Health yesterday revealed 143 new cases of the H1N1 flu virus in Ontario, a jump from 352 to 495 cases. Of the new cases, 139 have been reported by public health units in Greater Toronto.</p>
<p>Officials say the jump in numbers is due to more monitoring, testing and clearing of a backlog of cases.</p>

<p>Africentric school</p>
<p>gets full-time principal</p>
<p>Toronto District School Board trustees have agreed to appoint Thando Hyman-Aman as full-time principal to the Africentric alternative school opening this fall.</p>
<p>Trustees agreed last night to give the school its own principal, rather than have it share one with the school in which it will be located, Sheppard Public School on Sheppard Ave. at Keele St.</p>
<p>Hyman-Aman is currently principal of General Brock Public School in Scarborough and is co-chair of the board's African Heritage Educators' Network. About 70 students have enrolled in the school.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Agony, ecstacy; A world war ends, another begins: 1918 Spanish flu</b>
</div><div>Chris Thompson   </div>
<div>The Windsor Star</div>
<div>2159 words</div><div>28 May 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>B3 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>It was Nov. 11, 1918, Armistice Day, and Windsorites were dancing in the streets to celebrate the official end of The Great War.</p>
<p>Four years of bloodshed and global gloom were lifting, but inside Hotel-Dieu Hospital were dozens of people suffering from a terrible affliction that was bumped from the front pages by the conflict in Europe that would later become known as the First World War.</p>
<p>The Spanish flu had its grip on Windsor.</p>
<p>Many of those suffering should have by rights been celebrating in the streets with their friends. Many with influenza were young, vibrant and healthy, not the stereotypical very young or very old who typically suffer worst from the condition.</p>
<p>"The noise of the celebration was somewhat hard on the patients in the city," read the account in The Border Cities Star.</p>
<p>"Nurses and physicians resorted to put batting in the ears of the sick to prevent as much as possible the spirit of excitement affecting them."</p>
<p>The paper that day trumpeted the fact that only seven new cases had been reported that morning.</p>
<p>Over the previous two days, 35 new cases had been confirmed.</p>
<p>On perhaps the worst day of the outbreak, Oct. 26, a total of 93 new cases were reported.</p>
<p>Windsor had been waiting for the flu to make its way to extreme Southwestern Ontario, and leading up to its arrival The Border Cities Star carried stories about cases in Quebec, then eastern Ontario, and on Oct. 6 the paper reported that an ear, nose and throat doctor had quickly succumbed to the disease in Brantford.</p>
<p>On Oct. 12 the paper identified the city's first victim of Spanish influenza, Miss Irene Graham, 19, a store clerk who had moved to the city from neighbouring Sandwich two days prior.</p>
<p>"The Dreaded Spanish influenza, and his equally hated brother, pneumonia, claimed a Windsor victim Friday afternoon," the paper announced.</p>
<p>Over the coming weeks hundreds of people would come down with Spanish flu in Windsor, and more than 100 would die.</p>
<p>The victims were named, and ranged from the average shop worker to a 40-year-old priest and head of the philosophy department at Assumption College. Even the mayor of the day, Charles R. Tuson, came down with the flu and had to take several days off during the height of the crisis.</p>
<p>Widely believed to have been transported to North America by soldiers returning home from the war, The Star tried to prepare people for the arrival of the "sneezing disease."</p>
<p>"Spanish influenza, that dreaded sneezing disease that sneaked into this continent from Europe and, as the censor would have us say, "landed at an Atlantic port", is getting nearer every day to the Border Cities, and has now broken out at the United States naval station at adjoining the Ford Eagle plant, which has been quarantined," The Star reported on Sept. 23, 1918.</p>
<p>The flu is generally believed to have begun in China in early 1918 and made its way to western Europe by late spring, where it raced through the battlefields where soldiers spent their days and nights in damp, rat-infested trenches.</p>
<p>The flu came to North America on ships bringing back wounded soldiers, and it spread across the continent as the men travelled home on the railways of the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>There was even speculation in some quarters that the flu was in fact the result of a biological weapon developed by the German kaiser.</p>
<p>Windsor's medical officer of health, Dr. G.R. Cruickshank, did his best to prepare the public for the coming onset of the flu.</p>
<p>"Any one who goes into a crowded street car and coughs is worse than the German kaiser; any child that goes to school with a cold is worse than any German atrocity," Cruickshank told the Border Cities Chamber of Commerce days before the flu arrived.</p>
<p>The pages of The Border Cities Star began to feature advertisements for various flu remedies and water purification systems from companies hoping to capitalize on public hysteria.</p>
<p>With the flu striking during the height of prohibition, Cruickshank decided against a temporary relaxation on the sale of liquor being advocated by Ottawa. This despite the fact that Hiram Walker was offering free brandy to medicate patients.</p>
<p>After the initial death, The Star reported daily on the terrible toll the flu was taking.</p>
<p>The flu struck entire families, often both parents, frequently leaving behind orphans.</p>
<p>Windsor's death rate doubled for the month of October, from 32 in October 1917 to 63 in October 1918.</p>
<p>On Oct. 17 The Star reported that Hotel-Dieu was caring for 32 cases of the flu. Two of the patients were themselves doctors.</p>
<p>The severity of the flu varied in patients and could range from relatively mild symptoms like fever and chills, to pneumonia in the more severe cases with some patients spitting up blood. The worst patients would also turn blue or purple due to the lack of oxygen in the blood.</p>
<p>The following day The Star reported on the death of Mrs. Alfred Lauzon, 28, of Drouillard Road in Ford City. She had been ill for six days.</p>
<p>A new volunteer nursing organization, The Sisters of Service, had been created by the province and the Windsor chapter was hard at work.</p>
<p>They sought volunteers and tried to educate people "to assist in nursing the patients in case the disease spreads to such an extent that the nurses in the city will not be able to cope with the situation," The Star reported.</p>
<p>With the growing incidence of cases and the ability for the disease to progress rapidly, Mayor Tuson finally decided on Oct. 19 to order a ban on large gatherings of people.</p>
<p>"After 12 o'clock tonight, all schools, churches, theatres, dance halls, and all places of meeting will gather shall be closed until further notice," the mayor's proclamation read.</p>
<p>As the number of afflicted grew, Hotel-Dieu became extremely overcrowded and on Oct. 21 plans were made to turn the Sandwich Street clubhouse of the Great War Veterans' Association, the predecessor of the Royal Canadian Legion, into a hospital.</p>
<p>Appeals also went out for volunteers to assist in cleaning the homes of those afflicted.</p>
<p>"The majority of homes where volunteers were needed were among poor people who are unable to pay for a trained nurse and who have the usual heritage of a poor man, a large family of small children," The Star reported.</p>
<p>On Oct. 31 Mayor Tuson lifted the ban on public gatherings, but made it illegal to sneeze or cough in public and banned spitting on city streets.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks The Border Cities Star reported several times that the epidemic was on the wane, only to see another wave of illness appear.</p>
<p>On Nov. 19 the paper reported five deaths from the flu over the previous 24 hours.</p>
<p>One of them, James Craig, 30, of Monmouth Road, was a Walkerville police motorcycle officer. He left behind a wife and two small children.</p>
<p>Nine members of the extended Chick family succumbed to the disease.</p>
<p>After a lull the disease returned with strength and on Dec. 5 two rooms of Cameron Avenue school were closed because of widespread infection among children.</p>
<p>The flu also wreaked havoc on several workplaces, including the Great Lakes Dredging Company and the Windsor office of <span class="companylink">Bell Canada</span>.</p>
<p>On Dec. 6 Pte. Alphonse Sylvestre, a 19-year-old soldier on furlough to attend his brother's wedding, died at the home of his parents.</p>
<p>On Dec. 12 The Star reported that since early October 93 people had died in Windsor, according to the city clerk's office.</p>
<p>By Dec. 16 when the Great War Veterans Association home was ready to serve as a hospital there were 94 patients at Hotel-Dieu Hospital.</p>
<p>"The hospital is greatly overcrowded," said a nurse identified only as Mrs. Grant.</p>
<p>"Nine persons are in a room 15 feet square. Five of them are adults and the other four are children. All have influenza. Another room with room for two beds has six patients while another room large enough for two patients has twice that number."</p>
<p>The hospital was forced to appeal for volunteer nurses.</p>
<p>"If people only knew how bad conditions are, I am sure more women would volunteer," said nurse A.D. Bowlby.</p>
<p>Four of 26 volunteer nurses contracted the flu.</p>
<p>On Jan. 15 The Star reported that for the first time in 17 years, and perhaps the first time in Windsor's history, deaths outnumbered births in a quarter.</p>
<p>"During the last three months there have been 212 deaths and 195 births," the paper reported.</p>
<p>"Spanish influenza is blamed for the great increase in deaths. During the same three months of 1917 there were 103 deaths and 135 births."</p>
<p>By Jan. 30 the Medical Officer of Health reported the situation was rapidly improving and that there had been no new cases reported in Windsor in the past few days. The outbreak finally appears to be on the wane.</p>
<p>At the time what is now Windsor was made up of several smaller independent municipalities such as Sandwich, Walkerville, Ford City and Riverside. Each had its own medical officer of health so determining an exact count of flu deaths from the time is difficult because there was no regional health authority as there is now.</p>
<p>In the border cities, it is believed 126 people died in six weeks from early October through Nov. 23. Many more died after that date into 1919.</p>
<p>Although many in the medical community at the time criticized the local response, Windsor's current medical officer of health, Dr. Allen Heimann, of the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit, said it is difficult to pass judgment on people in a vastly different era.</p>
<p>"They weren't able, in 1918, to characterize viruses at all," said Heimann.</p>
<p>"They knew there were things smaller than a bacteria but how to deal with viruses, they didn't understand."</p>
<p>Heimann said the current flu scare illustrates how much things have changed in the world.</p>
<p>"People were in Mexico and back in Canada before this new strain of virus was even identified," said Heimann.</p>
<p>"You've got instantaneous communications now but also the increased availability of air travel."</p>
<p>The 1918 flu pandemic was one of the major factors that prompted the province to create regional health bodies. The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit was created in 1928.</p>
<p>Maher El-Masri, an associate professor at the faculty of nursing at the University of Windsor who specializes in infectious diseases and their transmission, said the current level of publicity about the H1N1 virus is because of the uncertainty about what it might do.</p>
<p>"In one way you want the public to be prepared, but on the other hand, you look at our experience with SARS, and what would have happened if it wasn't contained?" said El-Masri.</p>
<p>"You don't want to scare the public, but at the same time you have to be vigilant because imagine if the swine flu was the same strain as the 1918 flu and we didn't react."</p>
<p>El-Masri said many lessons were learned from the 1918 flu such as the importance of public education about precautions to take and the necessity to curb large gatherings of people in places such as theatres.</p>
<p>Windsor's mortality rate of 106 per 100,000 population in 1918 was less than a third that of London's rate of 326 per 100,000.</p>
<p>Other Canadian cities had more elevated mortality rates: 327 in Toronto, 489 in Montreal, 644 in Kingston, and 744 in Winnipeg. More densely populated American cities suffered even greater losses. The mortality rate is 721 in Pittsburgh and 819 in Philadelphia. The City of Brotherly Love sees 13,000 die.</p>
<p>Overall 50,000 Canadians die of influenza in the winter of 1918-19. Around the globe the flu claims an estimated 20 million lives, with estimates ranging as high as 50 million.</p>
<p>El-Masri said the jury is still out on what will happen with the current new flu strain.</p>
<p>"Every time you have a new influenza virus there is always the fear of a mutation into something more scary," said El-Masri.</p>
<p>"We're not out of the woods yet. The public need not panic but to do the right thing. Be careful, be vigilant, but don't overreact."</p>

</div><div>John Down   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>864 words</div><div>27 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>F4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>There was a fair amount of moaning and groaning Tuesday over the number of shots players left on Carnmoney Golf Club, but along came Wes Heffernan and vacuumed them up.</p>
<p>The only man to win the Alberta Open since 2006 took dead aim at a historic fourth straight title with a pace-setting round of nine-under-par 63 in the first round of the 54-hole affair. The 32-year-old veteran Canadian Tour member takes a four-shot lead over Ryan Vallely of Medicine Hat's Desert Blume into today's 18 holes when the 120-man field will be trimmed to the low 48 and ties for Thursday's finale.</p>
<p>Sitting at 68 were Calgary's Todd Halpen, Ryan Yip and James Love, while Barret Jarosch of Edmonton and Kris Wasylowich of Lethbridge had 69s as 31 players broke or matched par 72 on the 6,900-yard layout.</p>
<p>The leaders are all Canadian Tour players, who were shedding some rust after being chased out of Mexico two weeks ago because of the H1N1 flu. The 10 tour swingers not only had the top seven spots, but the other three were tied for 11th in the chase for a $20,425 purse.</p>
<p>Leftie Kevin Temple of Country Hills led the amateur side with a 70, one shot up on Grande Prairie's Alan Stewart and Calgary's Senan Foley. Temple won the 2007 Alberta Mid-Amateur while Foley is reigning Mid-Am champion.</p>
<p>Heffernan, who failed to land one of six qualifying spots for the British Open on Monday at Dallas, was up at 4:45 a. m. Tuesday to catch a flight to Calgary for a 2:10 p. m. tee-off. He wasn't too tired to carry his own bag or match the course record he shot in the second round of the 2007 Open.</p>
<p>A chip-in for eagle from the fringe at the par 5, ninth had him out in six-under 30 and then it was just a matter of dealing with a stiff wind the rest of the way.</p>
<p>"I was pretty tired,"confessed the former Alberta Amateur champion. "But I went home, rested for an hour, came out, hit balls and started feeling better. I got off to a good start, hit a 2-iron about six inches on No. 6 and kind of got rolling from there. Birdied the seventh and banged one in off the pin at nine for eagle and kind of had memories of two years ago when I went through five-under."</p>
<p>His only mistake came at the par 5, 14th when he caught the water hazard with his tee shot and made bogey but was quickly back on track, almost chipping in again at the 18th for what would have been a second eagle.</p>
<p>"I'm pretty comfortable on this course," he smiled. "Next to my home course, it's probably the one I've played the most in Calgary."</p>
<p>Vallely, one of the 10 Canadian Tour players, was forced to qualify and, while he hasn't played much competitively of late, quickly found the groove with a birdie-birdie start.</p>
<p>"After that, I was just freewheeling," said the 26-year-old, fourth-year pro. "I just went out to have fun because I haven't had a chance to play many tournaments so I didn't set my expectations too high.</p>
<p>"But it felt good. Awesome."</p>
<p>On a sometimes windy, sometimes calm, sometimes sunny and sometimes cloudy day, there were more than enough madcap misadventures. While tour rookie Halpen had few complaints outside of a few "harsh lipouts" in a solid round, other top players could only lament over stray shots that cost them dearly.</p>
<p>Veteran Canadian Tour member Stuart Anderson of Strathmore had it five-under through 12, bogeyed the difficult par 3, 13th and then waded into a triple bogey at the par 5, 14th when he elected to play from a water hazard. That led to a mud-soiled pair of pants and shirt and a 71.</p>
<p>Michael Mezei of Lethbridge hit tee shots into three different water hazards, suffered a three-putt from 12 feet and a four-putt from 10 feet en route to a 71.Love had it five-under after 14, but hit his approach into the water at 16.Wasylowich, who won the Open in 2005, couldn't get it rolling despite playing the par 5s five-under, including eagle s at ninth and 12th holes.</p>
<p>"I threw a good round away for sure," said Love, who didn't play the Canadian Tour's opener in Mexico before they were chased out of the country by the H1N1 flu. "I was in position to be five or six under for sure, but I haven't played in a month so I wouldn't have been surprised if I was five-over after 14, but it was five-under so that was good."</p>
<p>Tee times start today at 7 a. m.</p>

<p>Re: "The why behind the WHO," Kevin Brooker, Opinion, May 25.</p>
<p>It wasn't enough for Barry Cooper to display his ignorance, now we have to add Kevin Brooker. In 1918, at least 50 million people died of flu; not the aged or weak but the fittest. Thank goodness swine flu didn't turn out to be so lethal, but we didn't know that at the start of the outbreak. Should we have waited to find out if this flu was a killer?The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta, Health Canada, and the FDA in the U. S. took this virus seriously, but then again your experts evidently know better.</p>

<p>The Canadian Tour has returned to familiar territory for its annual spring qualifying school this week.</p>
<p>Morningstar Golf Course played host to the event for six straight years from 1992 through 1997. Some familiar names earned their Canadian Tour privileges at the Parksville layout, including Mike Weir, who tied for sixth in 1993 when now PGA Tour regular Scott McCarron was the medallist.</p>
<p>Other Morningstar grads include Notah Begay, Tim Herron, Jason Bohn, Ken Duke and Robert Damron.</p>
<p>Fifty-three players teed it up in Tuesday's first round. British Columbians in the field include David Cao of Vancouver, Stu Dunaway of Mission, Justin Hyun of Vancouver, Mark Kitts of Delta, Greg Machtaler of Summerland, Greg McAuley of Cloverdale, Roger Sloan of Merritt and Todd Ziniuk of Blind Bay. Sloan was tied for seventh after firing a two-under 70 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The top six players following Friday's final round will gain exempt status for the rest of the Canadian Tour, while the following top six and ties will receive conditional status. The Canadian Tour, which had to postpone three of its Mexican events because of swine flu concerns, resumes next week in Victoria for the $200,000 Times-Colonist Open at Uplands Golf Club.</p>
<p>Abbotsford's James Lepp, who hasn't played a Canadian Tour event since late last summer, has entered the Victoria event. Lepp lost in a playoff at last year's Times-Colonist Open to American Daniel Im.</p>
<p>RAY OF HOPE: Another player making his return next week in Victoria is Abbotsford's Ray Stewart, who is over the worst of some serious shoulder problems that have kept him sidelined for the better part of the last 18 months.</p>
<p>Stewart warmed up last week in Ontario with his son Brett, who is playing for University of the Fraser Valley at this week's Canadian University-College Championships in Hamilton.</p>
<p>"We played Weston the day we flew in, then we played The National, then we played St. George's, Glen Abbey, Hamilton, Toronto Golf Club and Heron Point," Stewart said. "It was a pretty cool trip."</p>
<p>CHIP SHOTS: Abbotsford's Nick Taylor opened with a one-under 70 in the first round of the NCAA nationals Tuesday in Toledo, Ohio. That left Taylor, a University of Washington junior, just one shot out of the lead ... The UBC men's team shares the lead with Laval after the first round of the Canadian University-College Championship. The UBC women have sole possession of the lead.

<p>The World Health Organization said on Tuesday that nearly 13,000 people have been confirmed infected with the new H1N1 flu strain but the number of countries affected is stable at 46. In its latest tally, which tends to lag national reports but is considered more secure, the United Nations agency said labs have confirmed 12,954 infections with the newly discovered strain that has killed 92 people.</p>

</p>
<p>The city has spent nearly $300,000 in three weeks battling the swine flu.</p>
<p>At its peak, the H1N1 virus kept 20 per cent of Hamilton public health's staff busy.</p>
<p>Though the effort won't affect the department's budget, it has made it a challenge to deliver all of the usual public health programs, said medical officer of health Dr. Elizabeth Richardson.</p>
<p>"It's the opportunity cost."</p>
<p>The department had to cancel several clinics and information sessions, such as school group presentations and a helmet-fitting event. A session to train nurses in dealing with clients with postpartum depression was also cancelled.</p>
<p>In addition, routine inspections of businesses such as restaurants and spas were delayed, though complaints were still handled.</p>
<p>The department's plan to implement an internal healthy food and beverage policy was also put off.</p>
<p>To date, Hamilton has had four confirmed cases of H1N1. There is another probable case and one person under investigation. Ontario has confirmed 352 cases, while the latest national tally is 921.</p>
<p>Hamilton's cost of dealing with the pandemic has dropped significantly from two weeks ago, when the city spent nearly $125,000 in staff costs and materials in one week. Last week it was $55,000.</p>
<p>Richardson expects the costs will remain at the lower level through the summer. But, she noted, no one knows if the flu will come back in force in the fall or if it will change.</p>
<p>"Those are the questions that we don't have answers for," she told councillors yesterday at a board of health meeting. "We're preparing for the worst-case scenario."</p>
<p>This week, public health is reviewing its response to date and asking all staff for feedback.</p>
<p>Halton yesterday reported four new students and two new schools with H1N1 influenza, bringing its total cases to 60. Forty-seven of the 60 cases are students at 17 elementary and high schools, 14 of them concentrated in Oakville.</p>
<p>A Halton high school student with a severe case was still in hospital yesterday.</p>
<p>Halton associate medical officer of health Dr. Monir Taha said the health department is in contact with provincial authorities to review its decision not to close schools at this time.</p>
<p>Niagara Region's health department confirmed its first case of H1N1, in a high school student who is recovering at home.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Expansive, expensive Pan Am bid faces challenges</b>
</div><div>Dave Perkins   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>715 words</div><div>27 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>S03</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Real racing for the 2015 Pan American Games starts tomorrow in Mexico City when David Peterson hands in Toronto's bid book, a stylish and entertaining blend of fact and fancy.</p>
<p>It says Toronto on the cover, even though much of it is about Southern Ontario, from whitewater paddling in Minden to rowing in St. Catharines, canoeing in Welland, boxing in Oshawa and volleyball and (for some reason) track and field in Hamilton.</p>
<p>Originally, the book was to have been turned over to the Pan American Sports Organization a month ago, but tragedy struck. The young grandson of PASO head Mario Vazquez Rana was taken by the swine flu virus and, understandably, PASO business was suspended.</p>
<p>Premier Dalton McGuinty gets his copy officially today, which is fitting since it's Ontario on the hook for the inevitable cost overruns.</p>
<p>As always, it's an impressive document; Toronto never looks better than it does in these things - and there have been a few. Considering the project's $1.4 billion (at least) price tag, and lack of finality on plans at this point, it should look good.</p>
<p>If the Ontario bid ranks ahead of Bogota, Colombia, and Lima, Peru, at this point, that doesn't necessarily mean it will stay there. Toronto is playing a dangerous game right now and we could go from first place to third place faster than the Blue Jays just did.</p>
<p>For starters, does everyone know Toronto also is bidding on the 2015 World Police and Fire Games? For two years, the city has been working quietly on obtaining this 60-sport, 10-day fiesta for more than 10,000 athletes. Technically it isn't a competing event, in that it is not ticketed and doesn't require the massive security and so on. That said, it will compete for sponsorship dollars, media coverage and volunteers (and the Pan Ams will need 25,000 of those). Plus, even bidding for them hands a crowbar to Lima and Bogota and invites them to swing away.</p>
<p>In reality, Toronto is one of six bidding cities and this seems to be mostly a courtesy bid, holding space for a future try at an event that is more of a tourism boost (these cops and firefighters pay their own way and don't need a village built for them.) The head of the police games organization is from Fairfax County, Va., which just happens to be bidding, along with Sydney; Winnipeg; Pretoria, South Africa; and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, according to the organization's website. Still, bidding at the same time looks dumb, to say nothing of the waste of money.</p>
<p>More of a problem for Toronto's Pan Am bid might be the plan's vastness. The equestrian events in Caledon, mountain biking near Barrie, field hockey in Brampton and shooting in Ajax make sense. But the two major summer games endeavours are track and field and swimming and swimming has been slated for a new facility at the University of Toronto's Scarborough campus, with track at a planned new football stadium in Hamilton. Those are 100 kilometres apart and mean long travel times from the athletes' village, to be built at the old Ataratiri site.</p>
<p>Why does Hamilton want a football stadium with a large running track around the field? One of the beauties of Ivor Wynne Stadium is its compact nature; fans are right on top of the field. Why lose that in a new place?</p>
<p>That's a local concern, obviously, one that can be rectified later. For the next six months, the focus is on PASO voters and how to impress them. They will be wooed this summer at the Caribbean games in Trinidad and Tobago in July, then at the IOC congress in Copenhagen in November, a month before the PASO vote in Guadalajara, Mexico, in November.</p>
<p>We're nowhere near the homestretch yet, but the time to win it - or lose it - starts now.</p>

<p>The Toronto public school board has its hands full with a looming deficit, pool closings and school safety. So why is it wasting time at tonight's meeting by trying to muzzle one of its outspoken trustees?</p>
<p>On the agenda is a motion to censure trustee Josh Matlow for comments he made in the heat of the swine flu scare.</p>
<p>The motion demands that Matlow "cease and desist his destructive behaviour and put him on notice that any further actions and/or statements will result in the board seeking whatever sanctions are made available to it."</p>
<p>In comments to a Star reporter earlier this month, Matlow said parents should have been informed about the possibility of swine flu at Vaughan Road Academy. It later turned out to be a false alarm, and Matlow corrected himself.</p>
<p>But fellow trustee Sheila Ward has lashed out at Matlow for scaremongering: "He had a responsibility to keep his mouth shut until he had taken steps to get all the facts," she told the Toronto Sun.</p>
<p>At the height of the scare, a great many things were said in good faith about swine flu, which later turned out to be untrue. So it's hard to imagine why Matlow's comments are being singled out.</p>
<p>Rather than wasting time debating decorum and muzzling a fellow trustee, Ward should do as Matlow did and speak her mind.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Saving Wiggles' bacon; Piglet rescued on 401 after falling off truck won't become pork</b>
</div><div>Susan Sampson   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>475 words</div><div>27 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT03</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Wiggles got a lucky break.</p>
<p>The piglet broke her leg, likely after falling off a livestock truck on Highway 401. But she was rescued and will end up at a good home instead of an abattoir.</p>
<p>Good Samaritan Brian Bowes was on his way to work in Cambridge on Monday morning when he saw the piglet lying by the side of the road, "shivering like crazy." There was an accident up ahead, Bowes says, so he was doing about 40 to 60 km/h in the fast lane, westbound on Highway 401 near Mavis Rd.</p>
<p>Other drivers slowed down to gawk, but no one stopped. He did. He pulled over, bundled the piglet into his car and turned around. Forty-five minutes later, he was downtown, handing her over to the Toronto Humane Society on River St.</p>
<p>"I'm a regular animal lover," says Bowes, adding that he handled the piglet despite the swine flu scare.</p>
<p>Bowes didn't see a livestock truck, but there's no question in his mind that the piglet had fallen off one. "She was really, really beat up - lots of cuts, scrapes and gashes," says Bowes, a 31-year-old computer network engineer who lives in Toronto.At the animal shelter, vets gave the dehydrated piglet water through a syringe, and she wiggled her backside - hence the name Wiggles. The cuts and bruises on her feet, head and backside were treated.</p>
<p>But her leg is broken at the knee and the bone will have to be pinned. Wiggles is set to have surgery this week.</p>
<p>"She's doing better," says Ian McConachie, senior communicator at the Toronto Humane Society. Yesterday, he saw her up and moving around in her cage, and eating on her own.</p>
<p>McConachie says a farm pig hasn't been brought to the animal shelter for about 30 years.</p>
<p>It's been about 15 years - when potbellied pigs were popular - since staff tended any pig, he adds.</p>
<p>The society is not looking for the farm Wiggles came from or the truck she fell from.</p>
<p>"The tragedy is that this pig probably won't even be missed," McConachie says. "It's just a commodity."</p>
<p>After surgery, the now 2- to 3-month-old Wiggles will recuperate at the shelter for six to 12 weeks. But this little piggy, who now weighs about 5.5 kilos, is not going to market. She's moving to a petting zoo, animal sanctuary or hobby farm, McConachie says.</p>
<p>"She's not going back into the factory farm chain and becoming food. She's been through enough."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine-flu death shocks family; 'Very healthy' Scarborough man, 44, was diabetic, but relatives say his condition was under control</b>
</div><div>Theresa Boyle   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>726 words</div><div>27 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Friends and family of a Scarborough man who was confirmed to have swine flu after his sudden death Saturday are in shock, saying the 44-year-old father of two was healthy except for diabetes and a recent cough.</p>
<p>"He was very healthy. That's why we are surprised," a family friend, who gave his name only as Mohan, said yesterday.</p>
<p>Ravinjan Paramsothy died at his Scarborough apartment at about 1: 30 a.m. Saturday. It is not known if the virus even contributed to his death. An autopsy has been conducted and results are pending.</p>
<p>Paramsothy sought treatment for a persistent cough earlier in the week from a family doctor who gave him medication, Mohan said.</p>
<p>He took time off work but returned to his job Friday after feeling better. But by the end of the workday, he was again feeling ill, according to a source. He returned home and his condition seemed to improve by the time he went to bed.</p>
<p>But just before 1: 30 a.m. "he started coughing and couldn't stop and that was it," the source said.</p>
<p>A family member called 911, but paramedics were unable to resuscitate him.</p>
<p>It wasn't until after he had died that he was tested for and confirmed to have the H1N1 flu virus, contrary to earlier reports that indicated he had been swabbed for the virus prior to his death.</p>
<p>Yesterday, stunned relatives and friends gathered at the family's apartment in the Markham Rd.-Eglinton Ave. E. area.</p>
<p>"His diabetes wasn't a big deal. Sometimes his blood sugars went up or down, but he was on medication," Mohan said, adding that Paramsothy appeared to be managing the condition.</p>
<p>He leaves his wife, a 10-year-old son and a 7-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>A framed photo of Paramsothy was placed in a corner of the apartment with a candle and two bouquets of flowers.</p>
<p>Paramsothy is listed on the Internet as working for Travelencia, a company that provides consumer benefit programs around the world.</p>
<p>It is not known where Paramsothy contracted the virus.</p>
<p>Visitation took place last night at the Ogden Funeral Home on Sheppard Ave. E. Paramsothy is to be buried today.</p>
<p>Anne Marie Aikins, a spokeswoman for Toronto Public Health, is prohibited from speaking about the case because of patient confidentiality. But she said people with chronic medical conditions can have a tougher time handling influenza. These include people with diabetes, cardiovascular-pulmonary conditions, renal conditions, those on immunosuppressant drugs and pregnant women.</p>
<p>"When they get influenza of any type, there is a higher risk of it becoming a more serious illness. The serious illness can then cause complications," Aikins explained. One complication could be pneumonia.</p>
<p>Paramsothy is the second Canadian with the H1N1 virus to have died. A 39-year-old woman from Alberta, who had a history of asthma and diabetes, died on April 28. An autopsy failed to show whether the virus was a factor in her death.</p>
<p>Diabetes is known as a "silent killer" and it is possible for those who have it to also have undiagnosed problems such as hardening of the arteries and poor blood circulation.</p>
<p>The latest information from the province shows that 371 Ontarians have tested positive for the H1N1 virus, up from 352 the day before. Most of those infected are from the Greater Toronto area.</p>
<p>While most cases have so far been mild, there are now five people in Toronto hospitals whose conditions are more serious. They include three youngsters at the Hospital for Sick Children, a 60-year-old man with congestive heart failure in Toronto Western Hospital whose condition is deteriorating and another adult.</p>
<p>Symptoms of the virus are similar to seasonal influenza and include headache, chills and coughing.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the H1N1 outbreak is expected to become more severe. Health officials are concerned about a second wave of the virus in the fall and about the possibility of it mutating.</p>
<p>The WHO is calling for the H1N1 strain to be watched closely in the southern hemisphere where winter is beginning. A vaccine is expected in late June or early July.</p>

<div>Five Things You Should Know About: Josh Matlow</div>
<div>Toronto</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Fellow trustees don't like his style</b>
</div><div>Chelsea Murray   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>620 words</div><div>27 May 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>Toronto</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Toronto's most media-savvy school trustee, Josh Matlow, faces a censure vote tonight at a Toronto District School Board meeting for comments he made to the media about the board's reaction to a suspected case of swine flu at a Toronto high school. The Post's Chelsea Murray offers five things you should know about Mr. Matlow and tonight's vote:</p>
<p>1 Fellow TDSB trustees don't like Mr. Matlow's style. Board member Sheila Ward, who put forward the censure motion, insists she's not the only one annoyed by his behaviour, she's just fed up. "He doesn't get along with anyone on the board," said Ms. Ward, who represents Toronto Centre-Rosedale. "I'm not different except that I have no patience for it." Ms. Ward and Mr. Matlow have butted heads before over Toronto's first Africentric school. She was for it; he was against it.</p>
<p>2 Board members don't like Mr. Matlow because he is infamously outspoken, issuing regular press releases and appearing often in the media. Instead of bringing complaints to TDSB chairman John Campbell, he often voices complaints to reporters. Mr. Campbell said he "firmly believes" every elected trustee is "free to speak their mind" publicly, but sometimes it's better to be discreet. "What probably would have been better to happen is if he'd [Mr. Matlow] have spoken to me and brought his complaint forward to me," he said, "or he could have spoken to the director of education right off the bat."</p>
<p>3 Tonight's vote is about his statements criticizing the board's reaction to a suspected swine flu case at Vaughan Road Collegiate. He disagreed with the decision to keep the high school open after a student showed symptoms similar to those of the H1N1 virus. Mr. Campbell maintains the board contacted Toronto Public Health the first day the student showed signs of the flu, then disinfected the school and made the possible case public the next day. Public Health officials say they spoke with the TDSB and gave no instructions to close the school. Mr. Matlow insists parents should have been informed about the case earlier and doesn't believe anyone on the board spoke with Public Health. "I know that to be true, they didn't," he said. "I spoke directly to the board staff members who were working on it and I've also followed up with Toronto Public Health subsequently. I would never say anything that I wasn't informed about."</p>
<p>4 Mr. Matlow said the censure motion is childish. He acknowledges his colleagues have the right to disagree with his actions, but wishes they could all "act like grown-ups" and discuss the issue without putting him on trial with only three minutes to defend himself. "I think it would be appropriate to have the trustees come together and have a discussion and give me an opportunity to explain what occurred that night," he said, adding, "This a political game that is inappropriate and I don't think the public has any appetite for it."</p>
<p>5 If the board censures Mr. Matlow, it would also serve as a warning. If he undermines the TDSB in the future, real action might be taken against him, the chairman warns. "If it's passed and it is resounding yes," explained Mr. Campbell, "it may give him cause to pause before going public with concerns or criticisms of the school board."</p>

<p>The worldwide death toll for swine flu was creeping to triple digits on Monday with new deaths in North America, while a clutch of new cases emerged in Europe, Asia and Latin America. According to the latest United Nations' World Health Organization tally, 12,515 people have been infected with H1N1 across 46 countries, including 91 deaths. The figure represents a rise of 493 cases on the previous WHO total and included five new deaths in Mexico, the epicentre of the outbreak, but did not include the newest three Mexico deaths, one more fatality in Canada and two more deaths in the U.S., bringing the global toll to 97.</p>

<p>A 44-year-old Toronto man with swine flu and "a chronic pre-existing medical condition" has died, Ontario's acting chief medical officer of health confirmed Monday. Dr. David Williams said the man died Saturday. "On May 24th laboratory testing confirmed a positive test for H1N1 in this [person]," Williams said in a news release. "It is not clear what role the H1N1 virus played in the fatality, which is now under investigation by the Office of the Chief Coroner."</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Shannon Boxx, Megan Rapinoe, Lindsay Tarpley, and Lauren Cheney scored to lead the U.S. women's soccer team to a 4-0 victory over Canada in a friendly yesterday, spoiling the home debut of new Canadian head coach Carolina Morace.</p>
<p>The world No. 1-ranked Americans, who signed on to play this game earlier this month after Japan pulled out, and were making their first foray north of the border in eight years, caught the 11th-ranked Canadians on their heels with an early goal. The night was virtually all-U.S. the rest of the way at BMO Field.</p>
<p>Boxx scored in the second minute, running onto a pass, taking two steps and firing a shot from just outside the 18-yard-box past goalkeeper Karina LeBlanc and into the left corner.</p>
<p>Rapinoe gave the Americans a two-goal lead in injury time before the break, hitting a shot from just inside the 18-yard-box that tucked into the lower right corner of the net.</p>
<p>Tarpley's goal came in the 77th minute from a scramble in front of the net off a corner kick, and the U.S. would score three minutes later, Cheney connecting on a cross from Heather O'Reilly and heading it backwards into the net.</p>
<p>The result spoiled Canadian star striker Christine Sinclair's bid for her 100th career goal. American veteran Abby Wambach was also gunning for goal No. 100.</p>
<p>Morace was hired to lead the Canadian team in February, succeeding longtime coach Even Pellerud. The former Italian team star had recorded two wins, a loss and a tie at the helm of the Canadian squad before yesterday, but a victory against the U.S. would have been a lofty achievement for a team whose overall record against the U.S. dropped to 3-38-4.</p>
<p>The Americans controlled the play for much of the night with their speed and crisp passes, and neither U.S. 'keeper -- both Hope Solo and Nicole Barnhart saw action -- had to make a difficult save. Canada's shots either sailed wide or over the net, and the only one on net, by Sinclair in the first half, went straight to Solo's hands eliciting a groan from the crowd of 10,255.</p>
<p>The last time these two teams had met before yesterday was on a rain-soaked pitch at the 2008 Beijing Olympics when the Americans dispatched Canada 2-1 in overtime in the quarter-finals in a dramatic game that saw a 99-minute lightning delay.</p>

<p>DIVERSIFICATION isn't always a good thing, as Manitoba's farm industry can attest.</p>
<p>While Canada was cruising to a 63.2 per cent increase in realized net farm income last year, Manitoba was stumbling towards a 30.7 per cent decline, Statistics Canada reported Monday.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for the disparity is that the farm industry is more diversified here than in many provinces, according to Keystone Agricultural Producers president Ian Wishart.</p>
<p>For example, Manitoba isn't as reliant as some other provinces upon grains, oilseeds and supply-managed commodities such as dairy, poultry and eggs, Wishart said. Instead, a greater percentage of Manitoba farmers grow pulse crops or raise hogs.</p>
<p>Most of the time, that's a good thing. But in years when grains, oilseeds and supply-managed commodities do especially well, which was the case last year, Manitoba doesn't benefit as much as those other provinces, he said.</p>
<p>"We kind of got left out in this particular case."</p>
<p>StatsCan said Manitoba saw its realized net farm income fall to $232 million last year from $335 million in 2007. Nationwide, meanwhile, realized net farm income jumped to $3.3 billion from $2 billion.</p>
<p>StatsCan defines realized net farm income as the difference between a farmer's cash receipts and operating expenses minus depreciation, plus income in kind.</p>
<p>It notes realized net farm income can vary greatly from farm to farm due to a variety of factors, including the type of commodities produced on the farm, market prices for those commodities, weather conditions and economies of scale.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada said soaring operating expenses played a role in Manitoba's weaker performance last year.</p>
<p>It was one of four provinces -- Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia were the others -- to post a decline in realized net farm income. StatsCan said that in all four instances, increases in operating costs for inputs like fertilizer, machinery fuel and animal feed outpaced the increases in farm cash receipts from the sale of crops and livestock.</p>
<p>In Manitoba, farm cash receipts rose 8.7 per cent to $4.7 billion, but operating expenses were up 12.6 per cent to $4 billion.</p>
<p>The biggest contributor to the jump in operating expenses was a whopping 41.4 per cent hike in the cost of fertilizer. Other key contributors were a 26.4 per cent jump in the cost of machinery fuel and a 13.3 per cent rise in feed costs.</p>
<p>Wishart said that for some unknown reason, fertilizer prices are unusually high in Manitoba.</p>
<p>He said a study two years ago for KAP found prices here were more than 60 per cent higher than in neighbouring North Dakota. And it's the wholesalers/distributors, not the retailers, that seem to be behind the discrepancy, he said.</p>
<p>He said he heard of a number of cases this past winter where some larger farm operators drove to Minneapolis, Minn., to buy their fertilizer rather than buy it in Manitoba. They claimed they saved $20,000 to $30,000 by doing so.</p>
<p>Because Manitoba has more hog farms and more cow-calf operations, it's also particularly hard-hit by higher feed prices, Wishart said.</p>
<p>He said it's too early to predict how Manitoba farmers will fare this year.</p>
<p>On the positive side, fertilizer, fuel and feed prices are all down substantially from a year ago. But on the downside, spring flooding has delayed seeding in a number of areas of the province, including the Red River Valley, the Interlake, and the area west of Lake Manitoba.</p>
<p>Wishart said the H1N1 flu crisis has driven down hog prices, which has hurt a lot of Manitoba producers.</p>
<p>"There are going to be some regions of the province... where it's definitely going to be another poor year (for farmers)."</p>
<p>murray.mcneill@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Province's producers fall behind</p>
<p>There were some big discrepancies last year in terms of changes in income and expenses for Canadian and Manitoba farmers. Here is how the numbers stacked up:</p>
<p>Category Manitoba Canada</p>
<p>Total cash receipts $4.7 billion $45.9 billion</p>
<p>% change +8.7 +14.1</p>
<p>Total operating expenses $4 billion $37.5 billion</p>
<p>% change +12.6 +11.1</p>
<p>Realized net income $232 million $3.3 billion</p>
<p>% change -30.7 +63.2</p>
<p>Here is a further breakdown of the Manitoba numbers:</p>
<p>Farm cash receipts</p>
<p>Hogs: Down 13.5 per cent to $803 million from $694 million in 2007</p>
<p>Cattle and calves: Up 3.3 per cent to $520 million from $503 million.</p>
<p>Crops: Up 23.8 per cent to $2.7 billion from $2.2 billion.</p>
<p>Operating expenses</p>
<p>Fertilizer: up 41.4 per cent to $731 million from $517 million</p>
<p>Machinery fuel: up 26.4 per cent to $329 million from $260 million</p>
<p>Feeds: Up 13.3 per cent to $565 million from $499 million.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>School board to vote on censuring trustee; Motion calls for John Matlow to ‘cease his destructive behaviour' after he publicly criticized the TDSB</b>
</div><div>TENILLE BONOGUORE   </div>
<div>594 words</div><div>26 May 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>It's easy to dub Josh Matlow the renegade of the Toronto District School Board.</p>
<p>The North Toronto trustee is not afraid to criticize the school board using his polished website, active Twitter feed and regular media alerts.</p>
<p>But what Mr. Matlow sees as his civic duty now has some fellow trustees in knots of anger.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, in a showdown worthy of any schoolyard, the board is expected to vote on officially censuring Mr. Matlow for questioning the board's handling of a suspected swine-flu case at Vaughan Road Academy earlier this month.</p>
<p>The board has never sought to censure one of its own. In a strongly worded motion, trustee Sheila Ward accuses Mr. Matlow of impugning the board and its staff, abusing his position, and bringing the TDSB into disrepute.</p>
<p>The motion calls for the board to ask “Matlow to cease and desist his destructive behaviour and put him on notice that any further actions and/or statements will result in the board seeking whatever sanctions are made available to it.”</p>
<p>TDSB chairman John Campbell paused to search for a more tactful approach when describing the censure vote.</p>
<p>“This is really more a statement of displeasure with the behaviour of a trustee, if it's passed,” Mr. Campbell said. “It's saying, ‘You know what, be a little bit more careful next time you speak out.' ”</p>
<p>For Mr. Matlow, the motion is a relatively futile exercise fuelled by a long-simmering dispute over the role of trustees.</p>
<p>In his mind, a trustee represents a community to the board. Others, however, see trustees as the voice of a united board: Dissent should be aired before a vote, and swallowed after a decision is made.</p>
<p>That doesn't sit well with Mr. Matlow, who was the director of environmental group Earthroots and ran for the Ontario Liberal Party in a 2002 by-election before joining the TDSB the following year.</p>
<p>He sees the public arena as the place such disputes should be settled. If Ms. Ward took issue with his comments, she should have called him on it, he said.</p>
<p>Instead, Mr. Matlow said she refuses to take his calls. “She actually wrote, saying that she doesn't see any point to talk to me,” Mr. Matlow said. Ms. Ward did not return The Globe's request for comment yesterday.</p>
<p>For Mr. Campbell – who will preside over tomorrow's meeting, and therefore votes only if there's a tie – the entire issue is a distraction from much more important matters.</p>
<p>“We have a deficit in excess of $24-million that we need to deal with,” Mr. Campbell said. “… If the board goes under supervision, this doesn't really mean much of anything. My focus right now is on seeing that we have a balanced budget.”</p>
<p>If the board does censure Mr. Matlow, the other trustees should not expect to see a great change in his behaviour.</p>
<p>The son of Mr. Justice Ted Matlow – whose “obsessive” opposition to a development project in his neighbourhood was deemed serious misconduct by the Canadian Judicial Council last year – says a decision to censure him publicly will send a message with which “I will respectfully disagree.”</p>
<p>“If there's something we're doing well, I support it. If there's something we need to do better on, I challenge them. I really believe that's my role,” Mr. Matlow said.</p>

<p>‘It's so hard to be good!” quips John Altschuler, the co-creator and executive producer, along with Mike Judge and Dave Krinsky, of ABC's new animated series The Goode Family, which debuts tomorrow on ABC and CITY-TV. The trio's previous collaboration was the long-running but recently cancelled King of the Hill.</p>
<p>The Goode premise? A post-hippie, eco-conscious vegan family, the Goodes, shower in rain water, recycle and hang up their wet paper towels on little clotheslines.</p>
<p>Curve balls include a vegan dog, who is so meat-crazed he eats local pets, and an adopted African child named Ubuntu, who is South African and white (to the Goodes' initial horror).</p>
<p>There is also a teenage daughter named Bliss who is cynical about being a freak, a caustic racist grandfather and any number of local antagonists who find it hilarious that the Goodes ask themselves things like WWAGD – that is, What Would Al Gore Do?</p>
<p>Released segments of the show promise the following recurring joke as well: The Goode family will, say, barbecue a piece of tofu while the grandfather and dog wrestle for a squirrel carcass, as the neighbours look on, shaking their heads and flipping their burgers.</p>
<p>This first TV prime-time strike against the eco-movement has the following ominously voiced introduction: “In a world of overpopulation, melting icebergs and rain forest destruction, can one family make a difference?”</p>
<p>The gravity of the question dissolves as the effeminate and spindly (of course) Mr. Goode (voiced by Judge, also the voice of King of the Hill's Hank) enters with a bag of “elephant dung,” procured from the circus for composting.</p>
<p>Another leaked bit shows the grandfather with a bag labelled SOUL FOOD, saying “They sure make good coloured greens.” “It's collard greens!” his son shrieks, and the grandfather then says black people are “collard people.”</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, this sort of argument, if infinitely more sophisticated in its context and performance, ran through All in the Family, when Meathead, the vexing liberal, would, for example, say “snigger,” and Archie, the dyed-in-the-wool bigot, would say, “I'm surprised at you. The term is snegro.”</p>
<p>At that time, America was recovering from a crippling, unpopular war and had a president many people despised (the show would last longer than both the Vietnam War and Richard Nixon's presidency), which feels familiar enough.</p>
<p>Yet Archie Bunker's views were not designed to be common sense in the rough. The show displayed balance between the extremes of right- and left thinking. Archie's son-in-law and foil Mike Stivic (Rob Reiner) was too radical, indolent and heartless, but his rage against Bunker represented the prevailing ideas of all believers in civil liberty.</p>
<p>And what do we have now – a cartoon maker cashing in on his Beavis and Butt-head/Hank Hill voice, as The Simpsons' Matt Groening did with the execrable Futurama and as Family Guy's Seth MacFarlane did with the sickening American Dad.</p>
<p>And he and his colleagues are not just cashing in, but offering us weak satire and much worse. What is hilarious, precisely, about the ecological crisis and overpopulation? Or adoption, or Africa, or the phrase “coloured people”?</p>
<p>I watched one vegan writer for The Guardian, Leo Hickman, twist himself into a pretzel, calling the obviously not funny show quite good and having a good laugh at “the politically incorrect” grandfather and himself: “If you can't laugh at yourself,” he stated, “you're going to find life awfully hard.”</p>
<p>What is he afraid of? I should think life would be harder if one were not prepared to stand up for one's beliefs and throw Chinese fighting stars at anyone still laughing. I observed the American left screaming like caged and taunted jackals since George W. Bush's first term, and fail to understand such abrupt about-faces as The Goode Family.</p>
<p>I thought everyone liked Gore and that Michael Moore cried harder than me during the American Idol finale when Mr. Natural was elected.</p>
<p>I thought bad fat men like Rush Limbaugh went after eco-geeks.</p>
<p>I thought one of the reasons Bush was hated was for his flinty-eyed view of all things soft and tree-huggy; for his Philly-cheese-steak savoir faire and cowboy world view.</p>
<p>While Hank Hill's simple Texas ways and ideas are not dissimilar to the point of view that would find a Goode family ridiculous, King of the Hill was a textured, character-driven show, not a series of infantile jokes based on the same premise.</p>
<p>When we still had Bush to kick around, no one bothered to talk about that old, inherently absurd term “political correctness.” And the president was reviled for his weak stance on ecology! Is America looking a bit too democratic, like a breeding ground for what virtually everyone now calls “dirty hippies”?</p>
<p>There is a house around the corner from where I live filled with a hybrid version of a 1960s commune and the Goode family. They decorate the porch in lavender and pink protest signs; collect buggies and other hauling devices; write PEACE on their dreamcatchers and announce, through a sign, that they Support War Resisters (praying, one assumes, daily, that conscription will soon exist and they might shelter a real draft dodger and paint his face with flowers).</p>
<p>I understand that these people are funny; I never want to join them when they play folk music on their porch. But I do not disagree with them for wanting to sing, as Jim Morrison did, embarrassingly and righteously: “What have we done to our Earth? What have we done to our fair sister?”</p>
<p>Are Americans becoming afraid of losing their right to be a greedy, consumer-demented swine flu upon the rest of the world?</p>
<p>The Goode Family in and of itself is just an inept TV show. But it signifies a popular discontent with actual goodness – without the dramatic flair of a villain like, say, Queen Doris of the Sixth Dimension, who in Richard Elfman's psycho-camp classic The Forbidden Zone inquires, “Why does it feel so good to be so bad?”</p>
<p>There are certain trees that I hug. That was hard to say. I love and fear for the world.</p>

</p>
<p>A 44-year-old Scarborough man with chronic health problems who died suddenly Saturday had swine flu, but results of the test done when he was ill didn't come back until a day after he died.</p>
<p>He is the second person in Canada known to have died with H1N1, and the first in the GTA, but in both cases it's not known if swine flu was a contributing factor.</p>
<p>Public health officials are probing the Scarborough man's death and awaiting autopsy results.</p>
<p>"They had a swab done previously and it came back positive. Right now, we don't know if that had anything to do with the person's death or contributed in any extent. We'll have to wait for the coroner's office to investigate that," Ontario's acting chief medical officer, Dr. David Williams, yesterday told a teleconference. He added, "I think it would be premature to assume H1N1 itself was the cause."</p>
<p>Williams said the individual, who had a "chronic, pre-existing medical condition," had been tested for the virus after suffering from flu-like symptoms. "We are trying to clarify when the nasal swab took place and was the person ill at the time and how ill. We just don't have that at the moment. We're still trying to do that back data filling," he told reporters.</p>
<p>Primary care practitioners can request that tests for the virus be fast-tracked, a protocol that is advised when a patient is suffering from underlying health problems. It's not known whether such a request was made in this case.</p>
<p>Paramedics were called to the man's home on Saturday but were unable to resuscitate him.</p>
<p>Williams described the case as "atypical." The man's family called 911 on Saturday after his illness suddenly worsened.</p>
<p>"Rather than going to emerg and getting admitted and having the condition over a period of time, we understand that the event happened fairly quickly. That's all we know," he said.</p>
<p>Because of patient confidentiality, public health officials are prohibited from revealing many personal details about the man, including exactly what other health problems he had been suffering.</p>
<p>In April, a 39-year-old northern Alberta woman with H1N1 and a chronic, pre-existing medical condition, died April 28. A post-mortem failed to show whether the virus played a role in her death.</p>
<p>Ontario has had 352 cases of the virus, 58 of which were confirmed over the weekend. More than 11,000 people in 46 countries have contracted the virus and more than 90 people have died.</p>

</p>
<p>Among the blessings of this Information Age is the wealth of available weather forecasts.</p>
<p>With at least five different services -- Environment Canada, the Weather Network, Accuweather, WeatherBug and Weather Underground -- offering forecasts for Saskatoon, almost always there is some variation.</p>
<p>I look at them all on the web every morning and then go with the most optimistic forecast. If Environment Canada, for example, predicts scattered showers with a high of 20 and the Weather Network predicts a high of 22 with no chance of rain, I'll go with the Weather Network. I'll mix and match, too, taking the best from each of the available forecasts. On a typical day, I might go with Accuweather's chance of rain, the Weather Network's forecast high and the Weather Underground's prediction for wind velocity. Basically, I'm a weather slut. Promise me just a little more sunshine than the other guy and I'm yours.</p>
<p>Of course, good old Environment Canada still is the most authoritative of weather forecasters, if not always the most optimistic. Publicly owned as it is, Environment Canada is also the most accountable. If you don't like the forecast, you can complain to your MP and count on a sunny weekend.</p>
<p>Competing weather services get raw information from Environment Canada, but they all use weather satellites, proprietary forecasting software, wheels of chance, dartboards, oracle bones and a network of seniors whose arthritic joints ache before a storm. By selectively compiling and massaging data from all these sources, weather forecasters achieve an accuracy rate that would get them fired from any other job.</p>
<p>Some of the private weather services offer more than just weather. <span class="companylink">The Weather Channel</span>, for instance, predicts the severity of weather-related aches and pains. Monday's ache-and-pain index was low, for example, but try telling that to Gramps.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">The Weather Channel</span> also provides a daily biting bug report. As I write this, activity level among black flies and no-see-ums around Saskatoon reportedly is high, while mosquito activity is rated as medium. That's three more excellent reasons not to go camping.</p>
<p>For those of us with hay fever or asthma, the <span class="companylink">Weather Channel</span> also offers an airborne pollen and mould spore index. Pollen concentrations have been rated as "low" all week, while the spore index is "moderate." If you're looking for an excuse not to do something, just say you'd love to but you can't go out with the mould spore index as high as it is.</p>
<p>Then there is the cold and flu index. Too bad it's not kept up at this time of year, when the risk of cold and flu is deemed to be minimal. While public health authorities around the world were sounding the alarm over a worldwide swine flu pandemic, the <span class="companylink">Weather Channel</span> did not even feel the need to activate its flu index. It turns out the <span class="companylink">Weather Channel</span> was right. Public health authorities might want to check the flu index next time before they lean on the panic button.</p>
<p>Of all the various services offered by all the forecasters, my favourite is Environment Canada's animated weather radar. Here, on maps of various scales, you can track approaching storms, colour coded by intensity. If seething blobs of dark green and purple are moving towards the city, you still have time to go to Plan B on that backyard wedding.</p>
<p>Weather radar helps me decide every morning whether to take the car or ride my motorcycle to work. If there's a big rainstorm heading this way, I'd rather stay dry and take the car. Then I leave it with the windows rolled down.</p>
<p>Speaking of weather, there was a day last week with frost in the morning and a UV index in the afternoon rated as "high." In other words, on the same day, within just a few hours, we could freeze and then burn. How airborne mould spores can survive these extremes is for the forecasters to explain.</p>

<p>Re: "Straight talk about life--evasions about death,"Naomi Lakritz, Opinion, May 20, and "Legalized euthanasia leads to no choice, ever," Licia Corbella, Opinion, May 16.</p>
<p>Surely, it is more than coincidence that the rise in society's acceptance of abortion and euthanasia follows decades of teaching evolution in schools as indisputable fact and the promotion of this view by the media. If we are just the result of a series of random mutations from some universal common ancestor, which itself was the result of an accidental combination of molecules in some primordial pond scum, then human life has no more inherent value than a cockroach or H1N1 virus, since these are simply the result of a different series of random, accidental mutations from the same common ancestor.</p>
<p>Consequently, there is no more significance to terminating diseased, deformed or merely inconvenient human life than culling BSE-infected cows or slaughtering surplus pigs that are inconveniently overcrowding a barn. However, it is a different matter if we are created by God in His image. Then we are not just the cockroach's cousins but we are special and valued, whether we have just been conceived, born with a cleft palate or have developed dementia in old age. In an age that seems to shun absolutes, Naomi Lakritz and Licia Corbella are absolutely right.</p>

<p>Swine flu may get the headlines, but white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that shows as a powdery pattern on the face, wings and legs of bats, is moving far more swiftly across the United States. Bat colonies have been decimated in at least seven states: New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. At least half a million bats have died, depriving the country --particularly in the spring and summer months--of a natural pesticide. Bats consume huge quantities of insects, as much as their own body weight during a night aloft. The U. S. Forest Service estimates that the die-off from white-nose syndrome means that at least 1.1 million kilograms of bugs will go uneaten.</p>
<p>The effects of the disease, though, go beyond an itchy evening in the garden. Without bats, farmers may have to use more insecticide, raising environmental worries and pushing up grocery prices. And white-nose syndrome could threaten already endangered species, such as Indiana bats, tiny creatures with pink noses that flutter from the Northeast to the mid-Atlantic, and the big-eared bat, the official state bat of Virginia.</p>
<p>The disease appears to have originated in New York state, in caves and mines in the Adirondack Mountains. Now it is turning up farther south, in Virginia and West Virginia. It may be carried on the boots and gear of humans who poke about in caves. Scientists, however, suspect that it is transmitted bat to bat. The disease disorients bats, disturbing their sleep and causing them to fly when they normally don't, during hibernation. Unable to find insects, they weaken and die.</p>
<p>The federal Fish and Wildlife Service has advised closing caves to explorers in 20 states, from the Midwest to New England. This directive, enforced with fines and jail, will soon be extended to 13 southern states. After all, as one Virginia scientist points out, "If it gets into caves more to our south, in places like Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia and Alabama, we're going to be talking (deaths) in the millions."</p>

</p>
<p>Well, we'll think about it.</p>
<p>That was more or less the response last week of the World Health Organization's director general, Margaret Chan, after being asked by various UN member countries to reconsider WHO's current protocol for assessing and publicizing disease pandemics.</p>
<p>Specifically, health officials from Britain, China and Japan (though they weren't joined by Canada, according to my reading) are imploring WHO to revise its current six-phase warning system to reflect the lethality of a given disease rather than merely how transmissible it has become.</p>
<p>This accords with any common-sense analysis of what we've seen over the past month.</p>
<p>Why, for example, would WHO continue to deem us to be at Phase 5 of the swine flu menace when the large majority of confirmed cases turn out to be mild?</p>
<p>The short answer, it appears, is that the scale was never designed to factor in severity. And despite a sort of gee-whiz acknowledgment by Chan and company that it might be a valid idea, my guess is that they are unlikely to change their way of doing business.</p>
<p>The reason: when you sow fear, you reap power.</p>
<p>That's the only possible reason I can come up with to understand why world health officials have acted in such a precipitous, dare I say, irresponsible fashion.</p>
<p>When it comes to generating a disproportionate degree of panic, one can always blame excessive media hype, but at some point the behaviour of leading health officials has to be examined.</p>
<p>Now, I understand erring on the side of caution. WHO's job is, at one level, predicting worst-case scenarios in order that individual states can achieve emergency preparedness. But it was the incredible haste of the development of this scare that leads me to think that WHO has made worst-case pronouncements their overriding focus.</p>
<p>I vacationed in Mexico from April 19 to 26. Before I left, there had been no mention of swine flu. While suntanning I did read a small article about flu in a Mexican newspaper, but thought little of it. It was only after emerging from Canada Border Services Agency that we learned of a full-fledged panic afoot, and that quarantining people such as ourselves -- informally, at least--was already being mooted.</p>
<p>My immediate thought was not "How can viruses move this quickly?" It was, "How speedy and efficient has science become?" I was asked to believe that, in the matter of just a few days in a medically underserviced country, a novel virus had been identified, its mortality and contagiousness were confirmed, and it was heading our way.</p>
<p>This in itself defies what I know about science. Previously unseen diagnoses ought to take time. Painstaking experiments must be replicated, over and over again. Or so I thought.</p>
<p>Suddenly, however, this new virus was being identified in laboratories around the world. How? And then, a pig in Alberta came down with this specific flu. Huh? We don't go around and test humans for diseases they might have, so how did that pig get checked?</p>
<p>Was all of this for real, or just "erring on the side of caution?" Like the questionable merit of donning surgical masks, is it just something we do to show we care?</p>
<p>I do know this: as with SARS and avian flu before it, swine flu has greatly increased the profile of the World Health Organization and its associates. They now have added motive to demand even more resources, more labs, more workers. More power.</p>
<p>And they march hand in hand with gigantic pharmaceutical companies, who are "helping us become pandemic-ready."</p>
<p>Most disturbing is the public's reaction: meek compliance. It is astonishing how conditioned we appear to be to believe that a rogue microbe might emerge to imperil the entire planet, even kill us all, just like the Andromeda Strain.</p>
<p>But in the length of human history this has never happened, and it is extremely unlikely to occur now. I, for one, plan to govern myself accordingly.</p>

</p>
<p>Conspiracy alert.</p>
<p>On the banks of the mighty Sturgeon, mysterious forces have gathered from around the world to demonstrate a subversive proposition. To wit (in every sense of that word): imagination is the secret weapon that trumps things like TV clickers, video games, your personal age odometer, neatness, common sense, dull routine, general solemnity, winter, etc. etc.</p>
<p>In the entertainment vortex around the Arden Theatre, starting Tuesday, the 28th annual edition of the International Children's Festival kicks up its heels for five days. And imagination, ageless and borderless, gets untethered on a variety of stages, in tents, school halls, a curling club, in the great outdoors, for 85 mainstage and 120 site performances. Be warned, glum people and control freaks: Public smiling and laughing will almost certainly be involved. Words are optional.</p>
<p>Nine mainstage offerings from five countries, assembled by festival director Nancy Abrahamson and programmer Troy Funk for this year's $1.2-million festivities, arrive on the Canadian kids fest circuit from Brazil, Peru, the Republic of the Congo, the U.S. and across this country. There were 10 mainstage offerings until last week, when festival organzers cancelled the visit of Mexico's Marionetas de la Esquina because of perceptions about the H1N1 flu. The group was going to present Emilio and the Enchanted Cow.</p>
<p>The 65-plus artists of the festival don't have much time for the usual boundaries between theatre, music, dance, storytelling, magic, puppetry. Some of them, like Peru's Teatro Hugo & Ines (Short Stories) and Gaia Teatro (The Worlds of Fingerman), create eloquent characters using their own thumbs or elbows. Some, like the 25-year-old Brasilia-based Circo Teatro Udi Grudi, have no respect for the usual division between objets d'art and trash either, or art and science.</p>
<p>The three insurrectionist clown/acrobats of Udi Grudi's O Cano make musical instruments from junk -- a length of discarded drainpipe, a straw, broken tiles -- while juggling stuff on fire or hanging upside down. When clowns rule, the dos and don'ts tend to get broken, and things have a tendency to mutate.</p>
<p>Luciano Porto explains that one of his fellow Udi Grudi founding fathers (and castmates), Marcio Vieira, is a graduate engineer, an expert in physics and acoustics. "He's been researching weird instruments, and building his own, for 20 years," says Porto, who hasn't exactly taken his university degree in communication literally.</p>
<p>Or maybe he has: he left Brazil thereafter to study mime, circus and clowning at Europe's elite schools -- the Desmond Jones School of Mime and Physical Theatre, Fool Time, and L'Ecole Philippe Gaulier. Actually, communication seems to be an Udi Grudi specialty. "We used to paint our faces onstage, invite kids up to make a big mess, have a big party.</p>
<p>"Then came a character who was strict, and said 'This can't happen here; I'll call the police!' So we mobilized the kids. And they told him, 'It's our right to be here,' " he said.</p>
<p>"We did a magic trick and turned the character into a clown. This is how we started doing circus," says Porto. He and his pals, equally learned in the theory of clowning and circus, bought a big top, and toured the satellites of Brasilia with a show that married traditional Brazil circus skills and gags to the "new" Euro-type circus esthetic.</p>
<p>"It's all about ways to get audience complicity," he says. "The main lesson is the pleasure the audience feels seeing you," directly related to "the pleasure you feel being onstage."</p>
<p>O Cano, which premiered a decade ago in Brasilia, has "very few words," says Porto. The ones it does have are invariably in the local language, and Udi Grudi has toured, so far, to 15 countries. None of them has been Canada, till now. China was a challenge, he concedes. "We learned some words at the consulate. Then when we got to Hong Kong, we discovered we'd learned Mandarin, not Cantonese. It was a sad moment."</p>
<p>"We can communicate with all sorts of people -- poor people in the countryside of Brazil, people in the big cities of the world. Magical."</p>
<p>That would be exactly the word for the ingenious Teatro Hugo & Ines, based in Lima, Peru, which brought its exquisite piece of propless anatomical puppetry, Short Stories, to the kids fest in 2007. That show, with its gallery of diminutive characters created from the fingers, hands, elbows and knees of Hugo Suarez and Ines Pasic, is back -- which gives new meaning to the term "hand luggage." Along with Short Stories comes The Worlds of Fingerman, a whimsical, wordless creation adventure by Pasic and Gabriela Bermudez, which traces the journey of our everyfingerman through air, water and fire, to earth. Says Pasic, on the phone from Lima in her lyrical mixture of English and French, "It's about the spiritual originals of humanity; it's about light, freedom, hope, the microcosm of the finger, the macrocosm of the body, metaphorically. Life, and our reason to stay here on Earth."</p>
<p>"It's very happy for me, for my spirit," says Bermudez of the six-year-old show. Now there's a mantra for a kids festival.</p>

<p>KIDS' STUFF</p>
<p>- The 28th annual International Children's Festival runs through Saturday in St. Albert, in the Arden Theatre and surrounding venues.</p>
<p>- In addition to the nine mainstage shows, there are 20 "site activities" at scheduled times (tickets: $2) scattered throughout the festival. Among the performers: award-winning Inuit storyteller Michael Kusugak, and Lucio Gelmini, the charismatic chairman of the Grant MacEwan College chemistry department. He's a natural for theatre since he blows things up. Educational motifs run the gamut from the obvious to the hidden: Rooney and Punyi's Educational Theatre Productions hosts an "alternative energy show"; The Silly People from Waterloo teach kids how to spin plates and juggle.</p>
<p>- He's still off to see the wizard: Since the Citadel's The Wizard of Oz has been held over, the astoundingly versatile John Ullyatt, currently the Tin Man, is unavailable to be The Human Fountain in St. Albert. His replacement? Jesse Gervais, fresh from Theatre Network's Buddy.</p>
<p>- If a tree stops and speaks to you, do not swear off dairy or junk food. Talk back. He's Walking Tree Man, a stilt-enhanced Californian in a 100-pound costume, who plants himself in various locations on the festival site.</p>
<p>- To replace the Mexican show Emilio and the Enchanted Cow, Canada's ingenious musician/inventor Al Simmons does additional shows in the Arden Theatre.</p>
<p>Tickets: Arden box office (780-459-1542 or <span class="companylink">Ticketmaster</span> (780-451-8000). Of the 28,300 available tickets, programmer Troy Funk reports, 20,170 had already changed hands as of Thursday, about 71 per cent of house capacity. Plenty were still available for Friday night and Saturday shows.</p>

<p>The return to government of India's Congress Party with added authority last week was a remarkable victory for an unusual political partnership.</p>
<p>Manmohan Singh, the 76-year-old Oxford-educated economist, will continue as prime minister with a mandate to re-energize the economic reform program he began in 1991.</p>
<p>But Singh keeps his post because he has been chosen by Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow of murdered former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, who against all expectations, including her own, has become the dominant force in Indian politics and leader of the Congress Party.</p>
<p>Singh is her front man and expert in policy and administration while Gandhi excels at the behind-the-scenes political bartering and bargaining that are the life blood of democracies everywhere, but especially in India.</p>
<p>Some eyebrows were raised when she picked Singh to be prime minister after the 2004 election when the campaign she led put the Congress Party in a position to gather a coalition able to command a majority in parliament.</p>
<p>As finance minister in the early 1990s, Singh had begun the process of dismantling the Soviet-style command economy favoured by successive Indian governments in the decades after independence from Britain in 1947.</p>
<p>And as well as presenting the acceptable face of market capitalism, Singh has a reputation for absolute honesty in a political culture that swims in a sea of graft. And he is personally modest and unassuming in a milieu that thrives on charisma and glamour. Some concluded Gandhi picked Singh because he represented no threat to the Gandhi-Nehru family dynasty she controls and which has dominated the Congress Party and provided India with three prime ministers since independence.</p>
<p>But it was a wonder, owing much to Gandhi's backroom skills, that Singh's government survived the last five years.</p>
<p>The Congress-led coalition depended for its survival on several regional communist parties, which raised bitter opposition to some of his economic reform plans, including the privatizing of pension funds and the encouragement of foreign investment.</p>
<p>The communists became totally apoplectic and finally withdrew their support from the Congress Party over Singh's deal with George W. Bush to have the United States recognize India as a nuclear power and mentor New Delhi into the good graces of the international nuclear regulation fraternity.</p>
<p>The expectation among most observers and analysts was that this month-long election, which began in mid-April and involved over 740 million voters, would produce yet another weak coalition dominated, as they have been for 20 years, by regional and caste-based parties making demands far beyond their stature. So it was a surprise when Congress won 261 seats in the 543-seat lower house of parliament and was easily able to put together a solid majority of 322 seats.</p>
<p>Most credit for that must go to Sonia Gandhi. She produced the strategy for confronting the power of the small regional parties and returning Congress to its position as the natural party of power it lost after 1991 when her husband Rajiv was killed by a Tamil suicide bomber.</p>
<p>She insisted on using government revenues bloated by the boom years since 2003, when the Indian economy has grown at nine per cent a year and more, on schemes aimed at the rural poor, who number at least 300 million among the country's 1.1 billion people.</p>
<p>Mountains of rupees have been directed at social, health and education spending as well as public works projects in the countryside, food subsidies and expensive loan repayment waivers for farmers.</p>
<p>If Singh was appalled by this assault on market economy orthodoxy, he kept it to himself.</p>
<p>But the electoral result was to sideline the small socialist and communist parties, and to give Singh a strong hand to drive his own agenda in the new parliament.</p>
<p>India's markets certainly believe that Singh will plough ahead with free-market reforms and restructuring that had to be shelved during the last five years of communist party influence.</p>
<p>Last Monday India's bellwether Sensex index rocketed up 2,000 points and twice tripped "circuit breakers" designed to curb excessive market movement. The first trip came 40 seconds after the market opened and the second 20 seconds after the floor was re-opened after a two-hour cooling off period.</p>
<p>But how long Singh will be around to take advantage of his victory is another question. He had heart surgery earlier this year and may not want or be able to finish his five-year term.</p>
<p>And there is a third person in this political partnership. Rahul Gandhi, 38, is Sonia's son and not only won election to parliament this time, but is credited with much of the organizational reform that toned the Congress party for the campaign.</p>
<p>Sonia Gandhi has always insisted Rahul must earn his political legitimacy. Many observers say that in two years time, when he is 40 and the same age as when his father, Rajiv, became prime minister, Rahul will have earned his stripes.</p>

<p>DAILY EXERCISE PROVIDES CARDIO BOOST FOR PRETEENS</p>
<p>A new German study shows daily exercise provides cardiovascular benefits even during the preteen years.</p>
<p>Researchers studied about 200 schoolchildren, who averaged 11 years of age. They found the kids lowered their blood pressure, improved their levels of HDL or "good" cholesterol and triglycerides.</p>
<p>Kids were also less likely to be obese if they regularly participated in a supervised exercise program that included at least 15 minutes of endurance training.</p>
<p>The children in the study will be followed for the next two decades to evaluate whether daily exercise during their youth affects their health in later years.</p>
<p>DRUG COMBO BEST FOR BRONCHIOLITIS IN BABIES</p>
<p>Results of a study at Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario suggests doctors should use a combination of drugs to treat infants with bronchiolitis.</p>
<p>The study involved some 800 babies seen in the emergency department.</p>
<p>They were randomly assigned to treatment with epinephrine alone, dexamethasone alone, a combination of both drugs, or a placebo.</p>
<p>After seven days, just 17 per cent of infants who received the combo treatment had been hospitalized.</p>
<p>That compared with 24 per cent of those in the epinephrine group and 26 per cent of those both in the dexamethasone group and the placebo group.</p>
<p>Bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory infection in babies under one year, affecting more than one in 10 each year.</p>
<p>PRE-1957 BOOMERS MAY HAVE SWINE FLU IMMUNITY</p>
<p>Baby boomers -- those born before 1957 -- might have some immunity against the swine flu.</p>
<p>Dr. Daniel Jernigan, an epidemiologist with the influenza division of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, says it's because those individuals may have been exposed earlier to a similar strain.</p>
<p>Jernigan says that could help explain why most of the cases of swine flu infection in Canada and the U.S. appear to be targeting children and young adults, and why hospitalizations and complications are most common among younger people as well.</p>
<p>He says the farther back you go in time, the more likely you are to have been exposed to H1N1 viruses before 1957.</p>
<p>However, he says the study found that while there was evidence of antibodies in some older adults, not everyone over 60 had antibodies that reacted to the new virus.</p>
<p>SLEEP APNEA MAY GO UNNOTICED IN THE OBESE</p>
<p>A common sleep disorder may be a latent danger for obese individuals with type two diabetes because it often goes undiagnosed.</p>
<p>A study at the Center for Obesity Research at Temple University in Philadelphia found that nearly 87 per cent of obese patients with type two diabetes had sleep apnea, but had never been diagnosed.</p>
<p>Sleep apnea is a condition that causes a person to have breathing difficulties while sleeping, and can lead to an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.</p>
<p>Gary Foster, leader author of the study, says doctors need to be aware that obese patients with type two diabetes are at very high risk for sleep apnea, even if no symptoms are present.</p>
<p>The study is published in the journal Diabetes Care.</p>
<p>VIVE THE FRENCH!</p>
<p>The French certainly know how to live: A study says they sleep more than anyone in the world's developed countries, and eat more, too.</p>
<p>The report, which surveyed 18 countries, shows the French sleep nine hours on average -- an hour longer than the Japanese, who work and commute more than the leisure-loving French.</p>
<p>And the French spend twice as much time eating as Canadians, Americans and Mexicans do.</p>
<p>The report also shows that Italian women have 80 minutes a day less leisure time than Italian men</p>

<p>As a Manitoban living in Bucerias, Nayarit, Mexico, a small town near Puerto Vallarta, I am writing to let all Manitobans who love to come to this area know that the H1N1 virus has not changed all of the things that bring tourists here each year. We have not had any cases of flu here and what we have seen is a very responsible approach to preventing a widespread epidemic. The states of Nayarit and Jalisco have responded with school closures, cancellations of fiestas and restaurant and night club closures. They also have personnel available to clean all shopping carts in stores and provide wipes for shoppers.</p>
<p>Information handouts for flu prevention are everywhere and masks are worn by anyone working with the public. Unfortunately the impact here is that with the cancellation of tours, flights and cruises, the decline in tourists only adds to the economic problem that has already been felt due to the global economic crisis. The result is that people who make their living in the tourist industry have almost no work. Hotel chains are closed and everyone who works at these huge all-inclusive resorts is impacted.</p>
<p>Yes, it is not high season, but tourists do visit year-round. There is no unemployment insurance here and many families will not have an income to sustain themselves until the tourists return. I want to encourage all Manitobans who love Mexico to return next winter and enjoy the beautiful lifestyle that Mexico has to offer. It has long been a good friend to you and it desperately needs your help. The H1N1 virus is an unfortunate reality that we have to face no matter where we live. So when you are making your travel plans for next winter choose Mexico for all of the reasons that you have loved it before.</p>

</p>
<p>Baseball is back in Montreal. Steroid-free, too! Beer, on the other hand, is not verboten, but it could cloud your judgment.</p>
<p>Two Montrealers, François Doré and Dwight Baird, have come up with a new board game, Xtra Innings, which should captivate everyone from baseball-starved Little Leaguers to grizzled armchair managers.</p>
<p>No dice, no trivia questions and no luck involved here. No umpires or spinning wheels, either. (Spitters, on the other hand, may come as an unintended offshoot of a participant's enthusiasm.) It's all about strategy.</p>
<p>The game features cards with every - and I mean every - offensive and defensive play imaginable in baseball. The pitcher, for example, has an array of nifty options at his/her disposal. As does the batter. Both try to outwit one another. Not unlike what transpires on the diamond.</p>
<p>A nine-inning game can be played in two hours. Then again, some extra-inning bouts can go on for many hours. This is where the amber stuff could come in handy. The game can be played by two or four players, but it is recommended rookies play with a partner.</p>
<p>Baird is no stranger to baseball. An artist - a natural realist, to be precise - by trade, he is still in mourning over the loss of his beloved Expos. He even stopped painting his exquisite baseball canvases because of his hurt. His current artistic focus is Cuba: He has created a series of jarring paintings of the country and its inhabitants, which he plans to exhibit in the fall.</p>
<p>"There was a huge hole in my life when the Expos left," says Baird, holding court in his St. Henri home/studio. "But I never gave up on the game." Three years back, Baird was approached by his ball-hockey buddy Doré with a plan for a baseball board game. Doré required Baird's insight into baseball to bring it to the next level. And Xtra Innings came to life.</p>
<p>"We're kids with dreams of making it to the big leagues," cracks Doré, not exactly a kid at 49. Nor is 52-year-old Baird.</p>
<p>Doré is, however, a games creator, looking to knock it out of the park with the next Monopoly or Trivial Pursuit. "I'm also an actor without a career, a film technician almost without a career and a painter - of houses, not canvases like Dwight," deadpans Doré, in reference to slow times on the local film scene.</p>
<p>But Doré is a keen competitor, be it in the ball-hockey arena or with his board game. He challenges me to a two-inning bout.</p>
<p>It is intense from the get-go. I throw him a nasty slider - in card format, that is - and he lines one foul. I throw everything I've got in my arsenal: outside fastballs, slow curves, inside fastballs and changeups. He hangs in tough. He eventually scores a run, but I strike him out to end the top of the inning.</p>
<p>I don't fare at all well at the plate when I come up to bat in the bottom half of the inning. But neither does Doré at the top of the second. I mow his batters down with a dazzling display of slow curves and changeups.</p>
<p>The floodgates open a little at the bottom of the second. Don't want to brag or anything, but, with two out, I muscle a triple down the third-base line. Then follow with a home run. I win 2-1. The crowd goes wild. Okay, just Baird. But it is a thrill. Though I must credit Baird for tipping me off to some devious strategies.</p>
<p>"No question, pitching wins games," notes Baird, a native of Huntington who played ball growing up. "I think we might have to throw in a rosin bag for the deluxe version of the game we're developing." Baseball Canada has already given the game - which also includes a Little League edition - its seal of approval. The potential distributors to whom Baird and Doré have presented their game are impressed. The game is currently on sale at Toronto's Rogers Centre and through www.xtra[http://www.xtra] inningsgame.com, and at $29.95 is - well - a steal.</p>
<p>"With the current recession, we didn't pick the easiest time to come out with a board game," Baird says. "But we remain hopeful that the game will explode in the U.S." They've already spent $75,000 in developing the game and promoting it at trade fairs around the continent.</p>
<p>"Best part of all about this game is that there are never any rainouts," Baird muses.</p>
<p>And no worries about chunks of the Big O tumbling on your tender cranium, either.</p>
<p>Perhaps not the best segue from a board game in which the workout is mostly mental, but can't resist this New Rule from Bill Maher: "Your hamburger can't be bigger than your ass. One sign your portions may be too large: if one of the health risks is a back injury!" And on the subject of piggishness, we pass along this helpful message: If you receive an email from the Department of Health telling you not to eat tinned pork because of swine flu, ignore it. ... It's spam.</p>

<p>Four schools in Edmonton have been dealing with the after-effects of H1N1 flu, with more than a dozen students diagnosed in both school systems.</p>
<p>The Edmonton Catholic School district sent a letter home to parents of about 430 students at Ecole Grandin School on Friday to inform them that one student was diagnosed with swine flu late last week.</p>
<p>"This weekend, staff of the district are going into the school to do a thorough clean," district spokeswoman Lori Nagy said Saturday. "There will be special attention paid to the washrooms, taps, doorknobs, keyboards in the library where the computers are, and also a thorough clean of the floors."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Edmonton Public School district has already been through the process, with 12 students affected at three schools.</p>
<p>The public school students contracted the virus at different times, spokesman Cory Sinclair said Saturday, and some have already recovered. Sinclair declined to identify the schools involved, but did say letters from Alberta Health Services were sent to parents to inform them of the illnesses when the cases were confirmed.</p>
<p>Five new cases of swine flu, all mild, confirmed on Friday bring the provincial total to 94.</p>

<p>KUWAIT / Eighteen U.S. soldiers have been confirmed as the first cases in Kuwait with H1N1 flu, the undersecretary of the ministry of health said on Sunday.</p>
<p>"They are 18 U.S. soldiers that were confirmed with the virus upon their arrival from their country to the military base," Ibrahim al-Abdulhadi told Reuters. A Kuwaiti official later said the soldiers were in transit and had left Kuwait. The 18 soldiers were the first confirmed cases in the Gulf. Kuwait is a logistics base for the U.S. army.</p>

</p>
<p>You'd think that there would be no better judges of an NHL player's talent than his peers.</p>
<p>But then you see that his peers don't think all that much of Sidney Crosby and there's no end of questions and speculation.</p>
<p>Don't they respect him? Don't they like him? Is he overrated? Over-hyped?</p>
<p>Crosby is once again in the process - it never ends really - of establishing himself as not only one of the best of this era but of any. The Penguins captain went into last night's game in Carolina leading all playoff scorers with 13 goals and may well be headed to a Stanley Cup final rematch with the Detroit Red Wings.</p>
<p>Yet a Sports Illustrated survey of 324 NHL players that asked who the best player in hockey is ranked Sid the Kid well down the list, in a tie for eighth place with only 1.9 per cent of the vote.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the runaway leader was Alex Ovechkin of the Capitals, with 51 per cent of the players naming him as the best of the best, well ahead of Red Wings defenceman Nicklas Lindstrom at 11 per cent.</p>
<p>Crosby teammate Evgeni Malkin and Detroit's Pavel Datsyuk were both at 7 per cent, followed by Detroit's Henrik Zetterberg and Calgary's Jarome Iginla tied at 5 per cent.</p>
<p>In total, 13 players received more than one vote and only one of those was a goaltender - Martin Brodeur. Players were not allowed to vote for teammates, yet notably three of the top six were Red Wings.</p>
<p>The poll was taken just before the playoffs, and if it were to be taken today perhaps Crosby would receive more support.</p>
<p>Maybe he still has something to prove.</p>
<p>AND, FURTHERMORE: Now 59, Mike Keenan has coached with eight different NHL franchises. In firing him, Flames GM Darryl Sutter said Keenan's greatest successes came in the 1980s. "I think a lot of coaches from that time (the '80s), the game has sort of moved past them." Dinosaurs, in other words? No one over 40 need apply for the vacancy? ... The manufacturers of FieldTurf use their installation at BMO Field as one of their stronger selling points but Toronto FC coaches and players clearly prefer to get off the artificial surface and on to real grass whenever possible. It is what it is, though, and whining about it does no good. If used properly, might it not actually amount to a real home-field advantage? ... The Blue Jays' average home attendance of 22,142 ranks No.22 out of 30 and their overall (home and away) attendance, going into yesterday, of 22,930 is No.29, ahead of only Oakland. ... Jays fever was sort of like the swine flu - not as severe as first feared. ... ESPN's Peter Gammons on the homer-friendly new Yankee Stadium: "We know that this was not a very well-planned ballpark. Any player that's played there will tell you that it's become one of the biggest jokes in baseball." ... A woman at a Mets home game at Citi Park in Flushing the other day somehow dropped a gold tooth in a toilet and when she went fishing for it (really!) got her arm caught in the plumbing. In ballpark parlance that would be known as going deep. ... It is not easy fitting the cream of America's golfers into standard-sized outfits. Says Fred Couples, captain of the U.S. Presidents Cup team: "Anthony Kim wears his pants down by his ankles, and Kenny Perry wears them up to his chest."</p>

</div><div>Times Colonis</div>
<div>1264 words</div><div>24 May 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>Victoria again has its own version of Bull Durham, the endearing and enduring classic tale of life in minor-professional baseball. Welcome to the world of the Victoria Seals of the Golden Baseball League.</p>
<p>The minor-pro level is a long-standing tradition in the North American sporting landscape and it's one with which Victorians are becoming well acquainted through hockey and baseball and possibly soccer in the future.</p>
<p>The alphabet soup -- ECHL, USL, GBL -- is sometimes bewildering, but it's a growing trend in Victoria sport. The latest minor professional team in town -- the Seals of the GBL -- opened play this weekend in Edmonton against the Capitals, continuing Monday in Calgary against the Vipers before arriving for the home opener Friday night at Royal Athletic Park against the Long Beach Armada.</p>
<p>But why do owners take the risk of precarious balance sheets -- minor-pro sports franchises straddle a fine financial line and seem to fold or move towns with the drop of a ball or puck? Why do coaches and players put up with the minuscule pay scales (an average monthly $1,300 US in the GBL) and the endless drone of travel?</p>
<p>Some players are chasing the dream of climbing up the minor-pro ladder to the big leagues; others couldn't imagine doing anything else. For many in this sporting life, the rest of us who toil in blue- or white-collar "square" jobs are, to borrow a phrase from Harry Potter, muggles.</p>
<p>"You wake up in the morning being able to do this [be at the ball park]. What better job can anybody have?" says Darrell Evans, head coach and field manager of the Seals.</p>
<p>It's a sentiment that cuts across all sports at the minor-pro level. During the ECHL playoff series this spring between the Idaho Steelheads and Victoria Salmon Kings, veteran minor-pro hockey player Darrell Hay of the Steelheads mused that he couldn't imagine wearing a suit and tie and going to work in an office. This is not for big-league pay, he noted. But still, he gets up each morning and his job is to play hockey. How great is that? No wonder he said he wants to keep it going for as long as he can.</p>
<p>And who wouldn't? In a sense, it's extended childhood play.</p>
<p>Sure, the money can be minimal and the day-to-day playing and travel is a grind, but players coming out of college and junior line up for the chance to chase this dream and live this lifestyle. There is never any trouble finding willing bodies. In fact, Evans says roster cut-down day is the toughest of the season.</p>
<p>Minor-pro in any sport is a vagabond existence, to be sure. It can be Victoria one season, Yuma, Baton Rouge or Peoria the next. But every time you walk through that dressing room door, whether it's in Victoria or Biloxi, you are instantly among 20-plus friends and comrades.</p>
<p>"Every year, you bring together people from everywhere and, after two days, they are ready to fight for each other and back each other up to the hilt," Evans says.</p>
<p>As a World Series champion and 400-plus career home-run hitter in the majors, Evans knows the relative luxury of life in the big leagues. The GBL is a long way from that, but he wouldn't be anywhere else, thank you very much.</p>
<p>"You get so close to these players over the course of a season," says Evans, who has extensive coaching experience in the minor pros. "And the players get close to each other. They become brothers. That's because they understand each other so well because they are all here and in this for the same reason. They are on a mission with their careers -- to play in Double-A or Triple-A or even the majors. But mostly, they just want to continue to play baseball."</p>
<p>It's what they do. It's who they are.</p>
<p>While that may help explain the players, what explains ownership at this level?</p>
<p>The baseball Seals are co-owned by the father-and-son combo of Russ and Darren Parker. It's a highly respected family that also owns the Regina Pats of the junior Western Hockey League. The Parker family has extensive previous minor-pro experience as the owners of the old Calgary Cannons of the Triple-A baseball Pacific Coast League and defunct Kansas City Blades of the International Hockey League.</p>
<p>"Local sports are one of the things people around any city always talk about; and our family has always been a part of that in whatever community we were in," says Darren Parker, who also serves as president of the Seals.</p>
<p>"Once that becomes a part of your life, it always stays with you. You know what these players are going through and you really feel for them and root for them in their quest to stay in the game and move up the pro ladder."</p>
<p>The romance of the dream is one thing, the business of minor-pro sport is quite another.</p>
<p>"The standard break-even point for this level of pro ball is between 1,200 to 1,500 fans per game. That would keep us afloat," Parker says.</p>
<p>"Obviously, we would like to see a full house every night. But we're shooting for 2,000-plus fans every night. I think that's a reasonable number. This is an entertainment option, and it's not an expensive one. More so than hockey, people come to the ballpark for the experience of it. Going is a family-and-friends togetherness thing. The ballpark was my babysitter and playground when I was a kid."</p>
<p>The GBL is among seven independent minor-pro baseball leagues in North America. Teams are not affiliated with major-league clubs but are another avenue of player development. The Golden league was established six years ago and lists 86 alumni who have had their contracts purchased by major-league teams, with those players placed on respective Triple-A, Double-A or Single-A teams. Current Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Scott Richmond played for Edmonton of the GBL last season.</p>
<p>The Seals are among the three GBL expansion franchises that were awarded for 2009, along with the Tucson Toros of Arizona, who play at Hi Corbett Field, the spring training stadium of the Colorado Rockies, and the Tijuana Potros. The Tijuana franchise, however, was forced to bow out of league play after the H1N1 swine flu situation in Mexico. That leaves the GBL with nine teams for this season. And enough dreams on offer to keep players, owners, and hopefully, fans, coming back for more.</p>

<p>As the world collectively continues to dither over the H1N1 flu virus, savvy movie fans might pose the query: Where's Dustin Hoffman when you need him?</p>
<p>Back in 1995, when a re-emerging deadly virus wipes out an entire fictitious village in Zaire in 24 hours, Col. Sam Daniels (Hoffman), of the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases, rides to the rescue.</p>
<p>The result is the scary suspense flick Outbreak, opportunely scheduled for prime time on Wednesday, 8 p.m. AMC.</p>
<p>The fictional plot in this outing is infinitely more sinister and deadly than in real life. In this tale, a monkey carrying the virus is smuggled aboard a freighter headed for a California coastal town and soon townsfolk begin to die.</p>
<p>Col. Daniels, scrambling to find an antidote, calls for help from a team of experts, not to mention acting heavyweights -- his disease-control researcher ex (Rene Russo) and her colleague (Kevin Spacey), a general (Donald Sutherland) who wants to blow up the town, wiping residents and the virus off the map just as they did 30 years ago when the virus first emerged, and the army's surgeon general (Morgan Freeman).</p>
<p>Movie guru Roger Ebert called it "one of the great scare stories of our time."</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Heartland in a stew over new beef bill; Small producers fear change gives power to the big players</b>
</div><div>Darcy Henton   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal</div>

</p>
<p>There's trouble brewing in the Tory heartland as an obscure law governing the funding of agricultural commissions has put rural Conservative MLAs in a quandary and prompted traditional party supporters to question the government.</p>
<p>Affected agriculture groups fear the Marketing of Agricultural Products Amendment Act threatens their survival. They say it will divide farmers and ranchers and hinder the work they do to market and research beef, hogs, lamb and potatoes.</p>
<p>The bill, which will enable farmers to demand the return of the mandatory fees that fund the commissions that work on their behalf, would take effect in the 2010-11 fiscal year.</p>
<p>Critics say it transfers power from democratic agriculture organizations to big producers.</p>
<p>"It amazes me that they want to do this," said Alberta Beef Producers chairman Rick Burton. "I am disappointed as a cattle producer, as a taxpayer, and as a long-time supporter of Conservative politics in Alberta."</p>
<p>Burton said the government is punishing his organization for opposing aspects of its Alberta Livestock and Meat Strategy which require farmers to verify the age of their cattle.</p>
<p>"If the government can do this to this association, where is the freedom of speech? And what does this say about the way government fulfils its mandate?</p>
<p>"That's why it should concern the taxpayer in the city. It's me today, but it's him next."</p>
<p>Conservative MLA Doug Griffiths, who introduced the bill, said it doesn't have anything to do with payback. The government is simply stepping in to resolve a dispute the beef producers have not been able to resolve on their own, he said.</p>
<p>A previous plebiscite 15 years ago ended up with a 51-49 split in favour of the status quo, he said.</p>
<p>Griffiths, parliamentary secretary to Agriculture Minister George Groeneveld, said larger producers have questioned why they have the same voting power as smaller producers when they have much more at stake.</p>
<p>"Maybe the focus should be on the people who are actually driving the industry, not just on people with one cow."</p>
<p>Griffiths said nine other Alberta commissions have refundable fees and they manage to keep revenues to do the job.</p>
<p>But Rod Scarlett, executive director of Wild Rose Agricultural Producers, said that in the cattle and hog industry, large producers who contribute a lot to the commissions could dramatically affect commission budgets by exercising their new right to recoup their money.</p>
<p>"They could basically hold these commissions to ransom," he said.</p>
<p>Farmer Ernie Israelson, 63, said feedlots that sell 100,000 head of cattle annually stand to recoup $300,000 or channel it to other organizations that will promote their causes.</p>
<p>"Suddenly, the dollars are voting instead of producers," Israelson said.</p>
<p>He fears the Alberta beef producers and the Canadian Cattle Commission could lose 30 to 40 per cent of their revenue if some of the big feedlots ask for the return of the service fees.</p>
<p>That's money that goes to promote the product and help the industry get through crises, he said.</p>
<p>Groeneveld told the legislature it's not up to government to tell business owners what business association they must support with their own money. He rejected the idea of letting the organizations decide the matter themselves.</p>
<p>"No matter the outcome, everyone loses in a plebiscite because it will only further divide a group that's already faced with the difficulty of trying to work together," he said.</p>
<p>Driving a wedge</p>
<p>The bill is driving a wedge through the heart of the agricultural community that has staunchly supported the Conservatives for decades. Many farmers can't understand why the government is pushing a bill they believe can only hurt their industries.</p>
<p>"If our commission goes under, there's nobody to help the farmers out," said lamb producer Larry Fesyk. "Everybody is on their own. It's a free-for-all."</p>
<p>Some rural Conservative MLAs have serious concerns about the effect of the bill on the organizations in their ridings.</p>
<p>Little Bow MLA Barry McFarland, one of several government MLAs to express concerns about the bill in the legislature, said he doesn't know what to tell his constituents when they ask him how he will vote. He worries the bill could hurt his riding's potato industry.</p>
<p>"I know that it won't curry a lot of favour, but as a representative for a constituency that probably has, along with my colleague south of us, in excess of 80 per cent of the potatoes grown in Alberta, I find it very difficult to support the bill as it is," he told the legislature.</p>
<p>Edzo Kok, executive director of the Potato Growers of Alberta, said his 120 members are pushing the government to reconsider.</p>
<p>"We tell them it's a beef issue. We don't want to be collateral damage here."</p>
<p>Alberta Pork executive director Paul Hodgman, whose industry has been hit by concerns over swine flu, said the bill shocked his 450 members.</p>
<p>"It's going to cause some big pressures on this organization on how it wrestles with cash flow. It will be difficult to plan and do things for the long term."</p>
<p>The NDP said the bill overrides the rights of the producer organizations.</p>
<p>"The government will, by regulation, give itself the authority in cabinet to overrule the democratic decisions of these producer associations," NDP MLA Rachel Notley said.</p>
<p>Liberal Kevin Taft said the issue pits a handful of powerful beef producers against the majority of small producers. He has suggested in the legislature there's a link between the bill and the big feedlot operators who supported Premier Ed Stelmach's leadership bid.</p>
<p>"They are big players and they stand to gain significantly from this," he said.</p>
<p>But Stelmach has denied a connection.</p>
<p>"This has got nothing to do with who contributed either to my campaign or to individual campaigns of any member of this house," he said.</p>
<p>Beef Industry Alliance chairman Russ Pickett, whose coalition of beef producers lobbied for the bill, said its members are a cross-section of farmers, ranchers and feedlot operators who haven't been happy with their industry representation.</p>
<p>"It should be run more like a business where shares are involved," he said. "Really, for us, it comes down to choice and accountability."</p>
<p>While there may be animosity over the bill for a while, in the long-term it will strengthen the industry, he said.</p>

<p>The son of a New York City assistant principal who died of swine flu pitched a no-hitter while wearing a cap bearing his father's initials. Jordan Wiener, the son of Mitchell Wiener, struck out 14 batters in a 10-0 win on Thursday, the day after his father was buried. The 18-year-old said he felt his father giving him the power to win.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Cruise agents optimistic despite recession</b>
</div><div>Anne Vipond and William Kelly   </div>
<div>Special to The Sun</div>
<div>585 words</div><div>23 May 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>G6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The recession may have got a few people down, but don't tell the 1,000 plus travel agents who recently gathered at the annual Cruise 3Sixty show in Fort Lauderdale. This is the largest annual cruise industry event in North America and next year the show will be held in Vancouver.</p>
<p>These unsinkable cruise agents are gushing with optimism, a majority of them saying they expect business to moderately increase over the balance of the year.</p>
<p>Their optimism seems to bearing fruit as cruise sales this spring have picked up smartly, a result of the many deals being offered by the lines.</p>
<p>Adam Goldstein, president of <span class="companylink">Royal Caribbean International</span>, said one of the biggest challenges in these times is to overcome the guilt people may have about taking a cruise during times of restraint. "But people need vacations to recharge and it is the great value of a cruise that experienced travellers recognize," he said.</p>
<p>Terry Dale, CEO of the Cruise Line Industry Association, predicts a record 13.5 million people will take a cruise in 2009.</p>
<p>There is good pricing right now with all of the cruise lines, be it a first-time cruise on Carnival or a premium cruise experience on Celebrity.</p>
<p>The luxury brands, however, may have the best deals as John Bleuler of <span class="companylink">Expedia</span> Cruise Ship Centers in North Vancouver points out. "The real secret for value now is the 5- and 6-star cruise lines. There are some exceptional opportunities for cruisers to try lines such as Crystal, <span class="companylink">Silversea</span>, and Windstar, just to name a few. Pricing has never been better."</p>
<p>The cruise industry had to scramble after the H1N1 flu temporarily shut down Mexican ports in late April. However the good news this week is that most lines will be returning to Mexico by the middle of June after the U.S. downgraded its travel advisory to a precaution. One interesting result of the shifting of itineraries and ships was Royal Caribbean moving the 138,000-ton Mariner of the Seas to the Pacific Northwest with a stop in Victoria. This itinerary has proved to be such a hit, the company is considering making the change permanent.</p>
<p>Good deals should be available to cruisers for the balance of this year and perhaps beyond as 36 new ships will be launched between now and 2012, including some of the largest ships ever built. In December the $1.2-billion US Oasis of the Seas, a 220,000-ton behemoth lodging 5,400 passengers, will be launched and is so large some of the Caribbean ports are being reconfigured to accommodate its size. Carnival's biggest ship ever, the 130,000-ton Carnival Dream (carrying 3,650 passengers), also comes out in December. Norwegian Epic, a 4,200-passenger megaship, will be launched in July 2010.</p>
<p>Some excellent deals to Alaska include Princess with line cruises to Whittier (Anchorage) starting at about $500 to $600 CDN a person. Holland America has also has some cabins starting at about the same price for roundtrip cruises on the Statendam in September. Celebrity has deals out of Seward starting at about $600 a person for an inside cabin. These are great for local cruisers as they originate in Vancouver.</p>
<p>For those interested in the Mediterranean, Holland America also has a 16-day cruise from Rome to Fort Lauderdale for $86 CDN a day per person.</p>

<p>The Summer Institute of Film & Television (SIFT) kicks off its 29th season Tuesday amid troubling signs in the industry and lower than expected attendance for its series of workshops.</p>
<p>"Registration is lighter than in previous years," said Max Berdowski, executive director of the Canadian Screen Training Centre, which runs SIFT and brings in some of Canada's top industry personnel to teach workshops in acting, directing, screenwriting, producing and new media.</p>
<p>"We're chalking it up to the general climate of the economy and the swine flu (fallout)," said Berdowski, adding one participant from Brazil cancelled due to a fear of catching the flu when flying abroad.</p>
<p>"If you look at attendance at Hot Docs (the documentary film festival) in Toronto, the Banff Festival, Cannes Film Festival, everything is down considerably. People are cutting back on travel and hunkering down a little bit and just waiting for things to improve."</p>
<p>He said the downturn in the film and television industry should be temporary and he expects production to rebound next year, as well as registration at next year's workshops.</p>
<p>This year, SIFT is honouring Linda Schuyler, co-creator and executive producer of the Degrassi TV franchise, which has become one of Canada's most successful and iconic television series. She will receive the Anthony Minghella Memorial Award in a presentation Wednesday night at Library and Archives Canada. Director Minghella (The English Patient), who died in March 2008, was a past participant in the summer institute.</p>
<p>Other workshop leaders this year include actress Megan Follows (Anne of Green Gables), screenwriter Donald Martin (Céline), David Storey, executive producer of Corner Gas and videojournalist Sasa Petricic (CBC's The National). In addition to workshops, there will be panel discussions and film screenings at Heritage College in Gatineau.</p>
<p>The workshops are mostly for industry personnel but newcomers to the industry also participate.</p>
<p>"The interest in terms of people looking to get into film and television continues to be strong," said Berdowski.</p>
<p>"It's viewed as an attractive area to get involved in. Yes, there are challenges in terms of production and broadcasting and all those things that people are reading about. If the climate becomes more upbeat economically I think people will still be looking to be trained and try and enter the industry."</p>
<p>A few workshops are full but others still have room. For more information and a schedule of events, visit www.cstc.ca[http://www.cstc.ca] or call 789-4720.</p>

<p>The United Arab Emirates has quarantined an airline passenger believed to be Canadian who is suspected of having swine flu, the health ministry said. Health officials suspected the passenger was showing symptoms of being infected with the virus, after which he was isolated. The passenger's nationality was not given. English-language daily Gulf News cited an unnamed official as saying a Canadian doctor of Pakistani origin had presented himself to a hospital in Abu Dhabi after suffering suspected symptoms of swine flu.</p>

<p>As a young professional golfer, Michael Gligic is finding out that when you don't really need them they're easy to get, and when you desperately need them they're hard to find. And no, we're not talking birdies, but sponsors.</p>
<p>"The guys out on the PGA Tour, who don't really need it, have sponsors coming to them," said Gligic. "And the up-and-comers who need the money, can't get the sponsors."</p>
<p>The Burlington resident, 19, who is in his first year on the Canadian Professional Golf Tour, figures his costs to play the Tour this year will be in the $24,000-$30,000 range, depending on whether he decides to play any events in Asia.</p>
<p>To help defray the costs, he will host a fundraising tournament on Saturday, May 30, at Lionhead Golf and Country Club in Brampton. The cost is $185 per player. You can go to his website www.michaelgligic.com[http://www.michaelgligic.com] for more information on the tournament or to enter.</p>
<p>June can't come soon enough for Gligic. He's counting the days until the Canadian Tour restarts the first week of June in Victoria.</p>
<p>Gligic had planned to be well into his first season on the Canadian Tour by now, but swine flu put a stop to that.</p>
<p>He played in the Corona Mazatlan Mexican PGA Championships, but the Canadian Tour pulled the plug on the rest of the Mexican swing for safety reasons when the swine flu outbreak caused a worldwide panic.</p>
<p>Since then he's been back in Burlington trying to keep his game sharp for when the Canadian Tour resumes. His team won the Hidden Lake Pro-am at his home course. He topped it up a couple of times on the Great Lakes Tour. He shot 72 and finished 10th at Firerock near London, and then this past week fired a three-under-par 69 at Silver Lakes to finish in a tie for second, one back of winner Andrew Jensen. That was worth $850.</p>
<p>He also played in a U.S. Open qualifying event yesterday at Crag Burn Golf Club in East Aurora, New York, outside Buffalo.</p>
<p>"I've been playing pretty well and I'm looking forward to getting back out there," he said.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Whole-in-one: A three-under-par 69 at Granite Ridge gave Reggie Millage, of the Clublink Academy, a win in the second event of the Golden horseshoe Tour. Ron Kenesky, of Hidden Lake, was a shot back; and David Banks, of Within Range, Alf Callowhill, of the Clublink Academy, and Jim Kenesky, of Lowville, tied for third with71s.</p>
<p>* Aces in the area include Ron Sinclair on the 145-yard second hole at Old Knollwood.</p>
<p>* Soroptimists International of Stoney Creek/Niagara hold their first fundraising golf tournament Saturday June 13 at Southbrook. The cost is $115, and includes cart, lunch and dinner. Register at www.ecsoroptimist.org[http://www.ecsoroptimist.org].</p>

<p>Air race over Detroit River returns to Windsor</p>
<p>WINDSOR The sport of air racing returns to Windsor on June 13 and 14, when pilots will twist and turn their aircraft through a low-altitude course on the Detroit River.</p>
<p>The city is one of six locations in the 2009 Red Bull Air Race series -- the others are Abu Dhabi; San Diego, Calif.; Budapest, Hungary; Porto, Portugal; and Barcelona, Spain.</p>
<p>Aerobatic pilots fly at up to 370 km/h through a course marked by 20-metre-high air-filled pylons.</p>
<p>Windsor Mayor Eddie Francis said the air race attracted about 750,000 spectators on both sides of the Detroit River last year. Officials said the race helped pump millions of dollars into the city's economy.</p>
<p>The first Red Bull air race was staged in Austria in 2003. For tickets, go to redbullairrace.com.</p>
<p>Mexican deals abound</p>
<p>NEW YORK Canada has downgraded warnings about travel to Mexico but deals still abound to get tourists to come back.</p>
<p>A group of resorts in Mexico is so sure you won't get swine flu there that they're offering three free trips if you do.</p>
<p>The participating properties are Zoetry Wellness & Spa Resorts, Secrets and Dreams Resorts & Spas, Azul Hotels by Karisma, El Dorado Spa Resorts & Hotels by Karisma, and Real Resorts.</p>
<p>The resorts are in Cancun, Riviera Maya and Playa del Carmen.</p>
<p>George Hobica, founder of AirfareWatchdog.com, says U.S. flights to Mexico are also on sale because of the swine flu scare.</p>
<p>"Airlines are bending over backward for those making decisions at the last minute, as well as for those wishing to travel. They're doing this for obvious reasons -- fill up those seats."</p>
<p>But travellers from Canada eyeing some Mexican resorts may have to wait. According to their websites, Air Canada had not planned to resume flights to points other than Mexico City until June 1, while WestJet didn't expect to resume flights to most parts of Mexico until June 20.</p>
<p>The Canadian government says travel to Mexico -- the epicentre of the swine subtype of H1N1 -- is no longer a risk to Canadians since the virus has been spreading through Canada for some time.</p>
<p>The Canada Border Services Agency will continue to visually check travellers for signs of illness. But the Public Health Agency of Canada will cease some Mexico-specific measures such as distributing health alert notices to passengers on direct flights to Mexico, and having quarantine officers meet every direct flight entering Canada from Mexico.</p>

<p>Hamilton has its first case of swine flu involving a person who didn't travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>The city's other three cases had all visited that country.</p>
<p>The latest case, reported yesterday, is in a student who caught H1N1 while attending school in another community.</p>
<p>"We're seeing local spread in several places across the province and it would be surprising if we didn't have some here," said Dr. Chris Mackie, associate medical officer of health. "This is expected and it's part of the process of influenza moving through communities."</p>
<p>Halton had one more case in a student yesterday bringing its total to 43 people ill. Of those, 33 are students attending eight different schools, mostly in Oakville.</p>
<p>H1N1 is spreading in the region and its cases have, until now, been different from those in Hamilton because none of those infected had recently travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>At least 300 people have now become ill with H1N1 in Ontario. Two have been hospitalized.</p>
<p>The best protection against swine flu is frequent handwashing.</p>

</p>
<p>Whether it's a fundraiser or a news and opinion website, success can depend on the star power you trot out.</p>
<p>Arianna Huffington, founder of the Huffington Post, is practically as much of a celebrity as the A-listers she corrals for her liberal news and opinion site, such as Bill Maher or Alec Baldwin.</p>
<p>The same goes for Tina Brown, the former New Yorker and Vanity Fair editor and current publisher of the Daily Beast, a similarly popular site where you can find posts by Meghan McCain, daughter of John McCain, on why she loves guns, to Sir Elton John on bands the Rocket Man is listening to these days.</p>
<p>Jeff Anders and Ali Rahnema may not have the glossy appeal of Ms. Huffington or Ms. Brown, but they have attracted a who's who of policy wonks and pundits to contribute to The Mark, their new Toronto-based site.</p>
<p>Launched earlier this month, it offers aggregated news stories and original commentary dedicated, as the site explains, to analyzing the news of the day and shedding “light on the dusty old question of what it means to be Canadian.”</p>
<p>The DNA of the site's design is taken from its distant American cousins, but the content is decidedly domestic. The Mark lists a few Toronto luminaries, including businessman and philanthropist Alan Broadbent and Luminato chief executive officer Janice Price.</p>
<p>Eearlier this week, it featured a post on the current economic crisis by Environics Research founder Michael Adams and another, by communications specialist Sylvain Raymond, on the re-branding of the swine flu.</p>
<p>“What we are going to try to do is give a platform to hyper-credible people who are completely unknown to the average Canadian,” said Mr. Anders. “We want this to be the cross-section of ideas across every industry and every field of activity in the country.”</p>
<p>The name of the site is meant to reflect the “aspirational nature of this product,” he added. “ ‘Make your mark' is what we say to our contributors. Have your ideas be on the mark.”</p>
<p>They won't make any marks on cheques, however. Contributors are not paid – which is not unusual for sites of these kinds.</p>
<p>Mr. Anders said that while he and Mr. Rahnema are currently finalizing deals with investors, “Right now we're funded by friends and family.”</p>
<p>The Mark has the potential to be a unique hub of ideas but could also stumble on the well-worn path of Toronto-centric publications that claim a national agenda but wind up representing the mindset of a few Annex thinkers. “Only one-third of our contributor base lives in Toronto, and at least half of those were born outside it,” said Mr. Anders, whose site will also feature blogs from Calgary-based venture capitalist Arlene Dickinson and former Vancouver mayor Michael Harcourt.</p>
<p>Mr. Anders and Mr. Rahnema met one another through a mutual friend about a year and a half ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Anders, now 33, a former strategy consultant for executives of Fortune 500 companies, had returned to Canada after completing a masters degree at Harvard.</p>
<p>Mr. Rahnema, now 40, a former vice-president of strategy and marketing at The Globe and Mail, found himself back in Canada after an overseas stint spent working as the corporate development director at the Irish Times Group.</p>
<p>The duo hired senior editor Jordan Himelfarb, formerly of the Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph, to replace the original editor, Joshua Knelman, who left to write a book.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Anders and Mr. Rahnema clicked over the idea of creating a forum where a broad range of professionals could share their ideas.</p>
<p>While the majority of the site's more than 300 contributors are academics, Mr. Anders says there are only two criteria for selecting writers for their portal, which took around a year to gestate.</p>
<p>“You have to be credible in your professional field, and therefore your bio needs to convey instantly that you have a subject-matter expertise to espouse an opinion on a subject. And the second one is, you have to have a direct link to Canada,” he said.</p>
<p>Whether or not pieces such as these will attract a large readership – The Mark hopes to draw one million readers each month – and stand out in a sea of other similar sites remains to be seen.</p>
<p>“Could it attract a lot of attention? Yeah, it might,” said Paul Benedetti, co-ordinator of the graduate journalism program at the University of Western Ontario.</p>
<p>“If they want to stake out territory, I think they have a big challenge, and that challenge is, why should I bother with your site? Why should I bother reading you? I'm oversaturated with information, I'm overloaded with stuff to read every day. What are you offering me that is distinctive?”</p>
<p>As well, The Mark may need to offer a better mix of high and low culture, a sensibility that is the hallmark of Ms. Brown's storied career. There are no posts on the site about sexy starlets and their dating habits or crash dieting – a welcome relief to readers who inhabit the high climes of thought.</p>
<p>But the absence of pop culture also might have a Slim-Fast effect on the site's page-view numbers.</p>
<p>“Without it, you can come off maybe perhaps a bit too academic or perhaps just a bit too earnest,” added Mr. Benedetti.</p>
<p>Rana Sarkar, president of the Canada-India Business Council, recently agreed to become a contributor to The Mark.</p>
<p>“I think just by doing it, you are a force for good in some fashion,” he said. “You've got to launch and learn.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Prague hits right notes -</b>
</div><div>Ask Journeys / Ron Pradinuk   </div>
<div>881 words</div><div>23 May 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>E3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>After last week's column regarding my success in getting a reader's refund on an online booking, only after going to the president's office, I had a number of comments that I should have named the property involved. I struggled with that decision as I was writing the column, but the excuse given to me was that the website had not been updated, and the refund would not have been a problem if it had been.</p>
<p>Did I accept this? No, but I was not willing to call the company liars. I also felt it may have been an isolated issue and not a widespread brand practice. I do recognize that a brand is only as strong as the weakest link.</p>
<p>For those who feel I should have named the property, you may very well be right, but I still stick with the decision I made not to do so.</p>
<p>QUESTION: We are thinking about visiting Prague this summer as an extension to a European trip we have booked. Have you been there and what can you advise?</p>
<p>ANSWER: It is near the top of my personal travel bucket list because friends and family who have been there rave about it. What I find interesting is the positive reviews are similar from both young and old. Not only does it get the good reviews but www.tripadvisor.com[http://www.tripadvisor.com] recently put it at the top of the list for the best bargain for cities in Europe.</p>
<p>It has been referred to as the Paris of the East because of its cosmopolitan nature, its historic sites, and its history in fighting for freedom under the oppression of the old Soviet regime. In fact, music was one of the means it chose to express its free thinking spirit.</p>
<p>In 1958, the Reduta Jazz Club hit a very sour note with the Soviets, who felt it represented a symbol of Western subversive culture. Because of its legendary place in heralding a break from Soviet dominance, it is now the host of an International Jazz Festival and anyone who is anyone in Czech jazz circles has performed there.</p>
<p>Tourists wander through the cobblestone streets of the main square, stopping long enough to enjoy a coffee or ice cream as they contemplate which of the 80 museums to visit. Travel back over a thousand years to Prague Castle founded in the 9th Century, or St. George's Basilica which was built in 920. Take a river cruise or a walking tour.</p>
<p>Of all the old Iron Curtain cities, Prague may have one of the most developed professional tour package offerings available for visitors.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Now that Canada has lifted its travel advisory to Mexico, will we see flights start to resume to that destination quickly?</p>
<p>ANSWER: A number of tour operators cancelled flights until the end of June. I don't think they will likely resume flights before then but they will try to restart their schedules as soon as possible.</p>
<p>While some people may still be holding off booking their winter vacations to Mexico, I think this will ease as we get back into the normal booking season in a couple of months. It is interesting to note that there are now more cases of the H1N1 virus in the United States than in Mexico. As I said in an earlier column, most countries of the world are experiencing some challenges with this virus.</p>
<p>No one should ever take health threats lightly but if you look at health issues over the past number of years, it is clear some perspective is needed.</p>
<p>A few years ago there were concerns about malaria in Punta Cana. That region suffered a tourism drop for some time and has not only fully recovered, but it has seen an increasing number of all-inclusive properties opening since then and thriving today. Only two years ago the chicken flu hurt Asian tourism. The region recovered nicely until the effects of the economic recession hit harder than the so called flu epidemic.</p>
<p>For Mexico, this too shall pass.</p>
<p>QUESTION: What is a Staycation?</p>
<p>ANSWER: It is a word that travel agents hate and the people at Travel Manitoba love.</p>
<p>Any time there has been widespread economic troubles, tourism becomes somewhat of a casualty. People, who still want to holiday, but in a more budget-conscious fashion, hold on to their wallets and select destinations close at hand.</p>
<p>This has happened through most recessions but only recently did some scribe give it a name that stuck. Canadians, for example, may choose to see their own country and put off a European junket. They may camp in their own province rather than travel to the east or west coast. There are a number of variations but they all relate to staying closer to home to holiday, and for the most part it is related to the economic climate, personal or global, individuals find themselves in.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Prepare for illness Flu virus shows that employers, employees need to learn rights, responsibilities -</b>
</div><div>Barbara Bowes / Working World   </div>
<div>1040 words</div><div>23 May 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>G1</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>44It certainly got me thinking about the flu virus and the rapidity with which both the illness and personal fear spread across the world. Every day we were confronted with television pictures of travellers with face masks being quarantined and airport personnel wearing protective masks. We saw shots of little piglets scrambling in their pens as if trying to run away from this deadly flu virus. As the various news outlets carried their daily updates for all to hear, the fear continued to grow</p>
<p>In many cases, the fear didn't even make sense or even have any scientific backing. For instance, fear grew so quickly that various countries banned pork imports and numerous people all over the world refused to eat it. So, it doesn't take much to see that fear can not only ruin someone's travel plans, but it can literally affect global trade and food consumption.</p>
<p>Yet, the issue of new and different strains of illness will continue to become more commonplace as world travel increases. This led me to wonder about businesses and employers and how they might be preparing for such challenges. How are organizations handling this fast spreading disease? Can an employer ban a suspect employee from attending work? On the other hand, can an employee implement a self-imposed quarantine, yet continue to get paid? What about fellow employees who are fearful of being exposed to the flu virus?</p>
<p>First and foremost, employers need to play a key role in protecting their employee's health and safety as well as their business interests by having a business continuity strategy. They need to recognize absenteeism, changes in customer demands and perhaps interrupted supplies and deliveries will occur.</p>
<p>To get started on their planning, employers need to begin by classifying the risk of exposure for employees and minimizing risk as much as possible. Next, be sure that you are aware of all federal and provincial health department guidelines and plans. Review your sick leave policies to ensure they do not penalize sick employees. Be aware that employee fear will also create concerns about pay, sick leave, family care leave and access to short-term disability.</p>
<p>Review your organization chart to identify essential positions and ensure that people are cross trained so that necessary operations can be maintained. At the same time, provide training for employees coupled with timely communication so they can fully understand what is going on and what the organization is doing to protect their health and safety. Help employees deal with the stress that will surely be lurking in the shadows. Contact your insurance carrier to determine the what and how of your benefit plan application during an illness scare such as the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>As a result of the earlier SARS experience, Manitoba Blue Cross for instance was able to quickly review its pandemic strategy and put measures in place to protect its own employees. Next, it strategized on how to deal with the potential of significantly increased claims and quickly developed a new claims assessment questionnaire. All claimants applying for STD coverage now have to respond to a questionnaire regarding H1N1 flu contact and/or quarantine.</p>
<p>With respect to making a claim, Marlene Thorarinson, manager of claims and benefit services for Manitoba Blue Cross, said that short-term disability claims for self-imposed and enforced quarantines will be considered by Blue Cross if accompanied by the appropriate supporting medical information.</p>
<p>Recognizing that some employers, as a precaution, might also impose a quarantine on an employee, even if there are no symptoms, Manitoba Blue Cross could also consider these claims on an "extra-contractual" basis. However, since payment of claims affects an organization's claim experience, it is best for the employer to discuss these implications with their insurance carrier or adviser. Finally, Manitoba Blue Cross made a number of arrangements to provide special advice to its clients on how to deal with fast spreading viruses.</p>
<p>However, another question remains: What if an employee refuses to cancel their trip, travels to Mexico or some other travel alert country and becomes ill? In other words, these individuals deliberately put themselves in harm's way. Will an insurance company pay benefits?</p>
<p>Thorarinson suggested that while being somewhat foolish, an employee who makes a claim after travelling and becoming ill, will indeed still be paid. The only time a person would be refused would be if an individual travels to a country where a formal war has been declared.</p>
<p>Insurance companies such as Manitoba blue Cross also have other protective measures for clients. For instance, travel insurance claims will be paid if a tour to a vacation destination has been cancelled due to health-related travel advisories. As well, this applies to anyone travelling within Canada who might get ill and must return home.</p>
<p>Travel counsellors as well attempt to accommodate their clients. Philip Houde, owner of River East Travel & Cruise Centre and chairman of the Manitoba/Nunavut Region of the Association of Canadian Travel Agencies, sent ongoing emails to all clients with updates on the flu. In addition, with the current H1N1 flu virus scare, Houde made special arrangements to bring his clients safely home from Mexico. In this type of situation, Houde suggests that all travellers stay in touch with their travel professional to confirm what their options for cancellation or early return might be and confirmed the best protection is true travel insurance.</p>
<p>This is the second time in the last few years that an unknown and/or new, rapidly spreading virus strain has caused significant public fear and anxiety. There is no doubt it will happen again. Next time, we need to be ready to deal with both the health issue and the resulting fear. We just can't allow fear to control our life.</p>

<p>Re: "Canada lifts limits on travel to Mexico,"May 19.</p>
<p>The hype over H1N1 flu leading to Mexico travel limitations was described as an overreaction and a big deal for nothing by newlyweds whose wedding plans suffered. When the world's health is in question, the instilling of travel restrictions, whether deemed necessary or not (in retrospect), should be applauded. These measures were put in place for the safety and health of all Canadians, so that people adamant on going to Mexico to get married didn't spend their honeymoons kissing toilets and making puke instead of love. I think the extra hassle and inconvenience of not being able to go to Mexico for 2.5 weeks was worth taking the precaution of spreading a virus with global pandemic potential. The displacement of a wedding seems more like the big deal over nothing in the midst of a worldwide health threat. Cheers to your new life together!</p>

<p>Mexico City Thursday fully lifted all swine flu restrictions imposed on the sprawling metropolis. "We can calm down now," Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard told a news conference, just weeks after the city was virtually shut down. Mexico City was at the epicentre of the outbreak of (A) H1N1 flu which has now spread to 41 countries, infecting more than 11,000 people and leading to 85 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The capital's website dropped its five-level alert to the lowest level green on Thursday, signaling that schools, businesses and transport could function as normal, without extra health precautions. The virus has killed 78 in Mexico and infected 3,930 people, according to latest health ministry figures Thursday. Even though the virus has now spread far overseas, WHO officials have so far resisted calling the outbreak a pandemic, remaining at level five which warns of an "imminent pandemic."</p>

<p>Influenza in decline across Canada: study</p>
<p>Flu is declining in Canada despite the arrival of H1N1, according to a Hamilton study.</p>
<p>Influenza peaked in February and has been decreasing every week since then, conclude researchers at St. Joseph's Healthcare who have been tracking flu-like illness across Canada since October.</p>
<p>The arrival of swine flu in Canada at the end of April so far hasn't caused any spikes in self-reported illness, according to the researchers who worked with Harris/Decima to conduct weekly telephone surveys of 1,000 Canadian households.</p>
<p>The researchers, led by infectious disease specialist Dr. Marek Smieja, asked about flu-like symptoms in the past two weeks such as fever, cough, headache, sore muscles, runny nose or sore throat.</p>
<p>Ontario had the lowest rate of self-reported illness in Canada in the last two weeks with 9 per cent showing flu symptoms. That is down significantly from nearly 30 per cent in February.</p>
<p>The national average for the past two weeks was 12.4 per cent. The highest rates were in the prairie and Atlantic provinces and in homes with small children.</p>
<p>The study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</p>
<p>Ontario has 272 confirmed cases of H1N1 or swine flu, 34 of them in Halton and three in Hamilton.</p>
<p>Man on probation charged in drug chase</p>
<p>A 45-year-old is facing a number of charges after stealing another man's prescription as he was leaving a drugstore yesterday.</p>
<p>The man accosted his 54-year-old victim outside the pharmacy at King and Ashley streets, stole the prescription and fled on foot. Later in the day, he was found at Jackson Square selling the drug OxyContin, a pain medication with oxycodone, an opioid drug like morphine, codeine, heroin and methadone.</p>
<p>He ran when police tried to arrest him, but was apprehended after leading pursuing police through several stores.</p>
<p>He was found in possession of the prescription bottle and some money.</p>
<p>The man, who is well-known to police, was arrested and charged with robbery, escaping custody, possession of proceeds of a crime, possession of a controlled substance and possession for the purpose of trafficking. He is also charged with two counts of breaching probation.</p>
