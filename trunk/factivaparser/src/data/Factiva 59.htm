<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Public health officials have confirmed a third case of the H1N1 flu in Waterloo Region. It was one of 36 new cases announced in Ontario yesterday, bringing the provincial total to 155. The latest local case occurred in an older adult who has fully recovered and did not require hospitalization. All of Ontario's cases have been mild.</p>

<p>Halton has seven new cases of swine flu that are being blamed primarily on students going to school sick.</p>
<p>The region now has at least 18 people mildly ill with H1N1 flu and 14 of those are elementary and secondary school students, mostly from Oakville.</p>
<p>"When we follow up with a lot of the students, we certainly get a history that at least for part of the illness many of them were at school," said medical officer of health Dr. Bob Nosal.</p>
<p>"Obviously when they are at school, they are likely to expose other kids and that's how you get the ongoing spread."</p>
<p>He says it's a hard time of year -- with exams and special events such as proms fast approaching -- to keep students home for the seven to 10 days required.</p>
<p>"You're three weeks away from final exams ... and for someone looking for good marks, I can appreciate the issues and the concerns," he said.</p>
<p>But stay home anyway.</p>
<p>"If you're sick with fever and cough, don't go to school," he said. "That is so important."</p>
<p>Hamilton has only had two mild cases of swine flu so far.</p>
<p>The province reported 36 more people ill yesterday including the seven in Halton, bringing the total to 155 -- all mild cases.</p>
<p>Four Oakville schools have now had students diagnosed with swine flu. Those include Lorne Skuce public elementary, T.A. Blakelock high school and St. Luke Catholic elementary. Letters went out to parents at the fourth unidentified school yesterday.</p>
<p>At least two students got sick with H1N1 at Christ The King high school in Georgetown.</p>
<p>Nosal said there could be far more than 18 people ill with swine flu in Halton. Close friends and family of confirmed cases aren't even being tested.</p>
<p>The region is also waiting for results from a number of suspected cases because the province's central public health laboratory is about a week behind.</p>

<p>Two years of talks between McMaster University and the public school board over a major new downtown development are expected to come to a head early next week when the board responds to a formal offer from the university to buy its Education Centre property at Main and Bay streets.</p>
<p>McMaster put its offer for 100 Main St. W. on the table late last week, said Jessica Brennan, chair of the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board. The board is now reviewing it before issuing a formal response, which she said would be ready by Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p>The possibility of a three-way partnership to build a major complex for a McMaster commun-ity health clinic, a new administ- rative home for the school board and a headquarters for the city's public health department hangs in the balance, with the board and the university continuing to talk this week.</p>
<p>"I remain optimistic, always," Brennan said. "McMaster is a stellar organization in this community."</p>
<p>Mac wants to buy the property, build its medical training centre and lease space to the board and to the city's public health department. The partnership would create a new multi-use complex that would become a critical new hub downtown.</p>
<p>Brennan declined to discuss details of the offer, citing policy of keeping property negotiations confidential. She said the board can accept or reject it without having to hold a full board meeting, and that no such meeting is scheduled before the response. The board's answer will come just as the university nears its own drop-dead date on negotiations for the board property -- by far its preferred site -- and moves on to other options, if necessary.</p>
<p>McMaster needs to get shovels in the ground by the end of this year so it can open its medical facility by 2011 and meet its training commitments to the province.</p>
<p>"We have said we've really got to get going," said McMaster vice-president and dean of health sciences John Kelton.</p>
<p>He declined to name a deadline, but said he and the university's chair of family medicine, David Price, hope to have a definitive direction by this year's medical school convocation, which is next Friday.</p>
<p>If McMaster can't reach a deal with the school board, Kelton said there are two other viable downtown sites next on the list. If those don't work out, he said the university could build at the McMaster Innovation Park on Longwood Road, though that fallback site would lack the central location the university had been seeking, primarily for reasons of accessibility.</p>
<p>Building downtown is a goal shared by philanthropist David Braley, who in 2007 designated $10 million of his $50-million donation to Mac to go toward a clinic downtown.</p>
<p>Kelton said that setting up house near the city's public health department makes sense on many levels. The potential for a swine flu pandemic has made those possible benefits even clearer, he said, given that McMaster has top experts in infectious diseases and the public health department is responsible for infection control.</p>
<p>Hamilton's downtown development director Ron Marini said the city's policies call for attracting and keeping public-sector tenants downtown, so the partnership also makes sense from an economic perspective -- as long as the city department stays somewhere downtown, as he is confident it will.</p>

<p>The Rev. Charles Cooper is pacing deliberately.</p>
<p>"I'm in dialysis, I go three times a week," he preaches, his cadenced voice rising gradually. "But that doesn't stop me from serving God!"</p>
<p>Here, in the lobby of Dr. Gleem Car Wash and Lube Center, there are no pews, no choir and no ushers.</p>
<p>There are, however, about 20 folding chairs arranged in a</p>
<p>circle. Listeners -- mostly staff -- hold coffee mugs in one hand and search for Bible verses with the other. And everyone seats themselves.</p>
<p>"We're having church here," Cooper continues, dressed in jeans and a red T-shirt emblazoned with the Gleem logo. "The Spirit is where the Lord is."</p>
<p>For the past four years, employees have held Bible study at its northwest location on Friday mornings. There are four locations throughout Houston.</p>
<p>The idea was born after weekly staff meetings began ending in fights and finger-pointing, said manager Herb Alcarez.</p>
<p>Alcarez and fellow manager Kevin Jenkins -- whose father founded the business in 1967 -- decided to offer Bible study at the meetings. The managers approached Cooper, a regular customer and pastor at New Hope Missionary Baptist Church, to help. Pastor Alex Morrison, of Houston Christway Ministries, also helps lead the Bible study.</p>
<p>"I used to think 'I got these car washes. God, I'll call you when I need you,' " Jenkins said, about the decision to express faith more openly. "Now it is 'God, this is your car wash, show me what to do.' "</p>
<p>Though the Bible study is open to everyone, mostly employees attend. Members of the group of about 20 attend different churches.</p>
<p>On a recent Friday, prayers are requested for family members: Pastor Cooper says his daughter is like "the prodigal son." Another participant asks for prayer about participating in a funeral.</p>
<p>The subjects are as varied as the recession (no one's job is in jeopardy, thanks to God), the swine flu (God will protect employees) and the kinds of customers the group sees (you can't take your Rolex watch to heaven).</p>
<p>"I'm grateful for my job, to be able to put food on the table for my family," says Christino Jose Aguilar. "That's the best feeling in the world."</p>
<p>The 7 a.m. Bible study is not the only clue that this is a faith-based business.</p>
<p>"Christian radio station KSBJ wafts from the speakers as workers wax and towel dry vehicles. The cashier's counter has free Bibles and handouts with Scriptures. Behind the desk lies a wooden plaque of the Ten Commandments. It's a "church disguised as a car wash," Jenkins likes to say.</p>
<p>For Jenkins, that "disguise" could make all the difference.</p>
<p>"Someone might come in here, they might have just lost their job," he said of their opportunity to minister to anyone who comes in. "We need to say a kind word."</p>

<p>The H1N1 viral attack causes me to reflect on the delivery of health care.</p>
<p>When I was a GP in the 1950s (house calls and all) I went through two flu epidemics. Most cases were handled at home and many times I learned a patient had been affected after the fact.</p>
<p>I think this was because they knew their family doctor was available to them 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>The excellence of the epidemiologists in getting a handle on this outbreak shouldn't be underestimated but the question arises: How is the service to be delivered to the individual patient?</p>
<p>It was better then and both the medical profession and the patient are the losers.</p>

<p>Don't you guys get it, especially, since the World Health Organization has asked everyone to refrain from using the name swine flu? Show some respect for the Canadian farmers.</p>

<p>Five new cases of swine flu have been confirmed in the Saskatoon Health Region, bringing the total number of Saskatchewan cases to 17.</p>
<p>"Up to this point it has not presented any severe illness," said Dr. Johnmark Opondo, deputy medical health officer for the region.</p>
<p>The new cases have been found in people ranging in age from nine to 51 and are scattered throughout the health region, with no strong connections to one another.</p>
<p>"It's hard to say that there were two cases in one family," Opondo said. "We know that in some of the situations . . . there were other members of the family with some mild respiratory symptoms."</p>
<p>When some of these confirmed people were ill, other members of their family also experienced respiratory symptoms, though they were so mild they were not tested.</p>
<p>All of the people with recent cases had not travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>Because the behaviour of the virus is comparable to seasonal flu, with very few people experiencing severe symptoms, surveillance efforts may be shifted.</p>
<p>"The surveillance parameters are really under discussion," Opondo said. Efforts may return to more routine surveillance, with a focus on serious cases. In the first few weeks, the recommendation was to test everybody who had symptoms and a "suggestive history." Now those with mild illness will likely not be tested.</p>
<p>While samples were initially sent to Winnipeg for testing, the Saskatchewan Disease Control Lab is now able to handle specimens. Of the 17 positive cases in Saskatchewan, one was found at the Winnipeg lab.</p>
<p>The rest were identified in the Regina Public Health lab, which had tested 649 samples as of Thursday.</p>
<p>Some of the regions are sending more samples than others, with the Regina Qu'Appelle Regional Health Authority sending the most. Only one positive case was found in the region, and it had a connection to Mexico.</p>
<p>"People's interest is piqued," said Greg Horsman, medical director of the Saskatchewan disease control lab.</p>
<p>Of the 54 samples tested Wednesday, four were positive for influenza A, one for the A3 seasonal strain, two for the H1 seasonal strain and one for the H1N1 influenza swine flu.</p>

</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>

</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq is travelling to Switzerland this weekend to attend the World Health Organization's annual assembly where the outbreak of human swine flu, which has spread to 33 nations, is expected to dominate discussions.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq is heading a delegation of Canadian health officials and while in Geneva for the World Health Assembly she plans to meet with WHO director-general Margaret Chan, as well as her U.S. and Mexican counterparts. She will also participate in a panel discussion on the H1N1 virus that originated in Mexico and has hit the United States the hardest with more than 4,000 confirmed infections.</p>
<p>Among the topics that will be reviewed during the WHO meetings is whether to direct manufacturers to begin production of a vaccine against the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"It's an international joint decision," Aglukkaq said Thursday after appearing before the House of Commons health committee. "I'll be meeting with (the WHO) this weekend."</p>
<p>Expert scientists convened by WHO had their own discussion Thursday about whether mass production of a vaccine should be undertaken. Acting assistant director-general Keiji Fukuda said in a briefing for reporters that "no big decisions " had been made and that more meetings are needed.</p>
<p>If the UN agency does recommend that manufacturers proceed with a vaccine for the virus, it would disrupt the production of seasonal influenza vaccines which is why, according to Fukuda, the decision requires careful consideration.</p>
<p>The seasonal flu causes three to five million cases of severe illness a year and according to WHO, kills between 250,000 and 500,000. In Canada, it is estimated that between 4,000 and 8,000 people can die of influenza and its related complications yearly.</p>
<p>The recent outbreak of H1N1 in humans has so far killed 65 people worldwide and infected 6,497 people, WHO reported Thursday.</p>
<p>But that figure did not include the jump in cases in the United States that was reported Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. rose by 946 and now stands at 4,298.</p>
<p>Only West Virginia, Mississippi, Wyoming and Alaska have escaped the spread of the virus but CDC officials said they believe the flu strain will eventually be reported in every state.</p>
<p>Sixty new cases of swine flu were confirmed by Canadian health officials Thursday, bringing the country's total to 449.</p>
<p>The bulk of the new cases -- 36 of them -- are in Ontario, 12 are in Quebec, with the rest coming from Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alberta health officials said Thursday an autopsy on a northern Alberta woman who died after catching H1N1 was unable to determine whether the virus played a role in her death.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old woman from Gift Lake Metis Settlement died in hospital in April after catching the virus from unknown sources. She also had asthma and diabetes.</p>
<p>"The report, which I received late today, does not clarify what role the H1N1 virus may or may not have played in her death," Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, said in a release Thursday.</p>
<p>The federal government's pandemic preparedness plan includes producing a vaccine domestically if needed. Once a decision is made to manufacture a vaccine for this specific strain it would take about six months to develop and test it.</p>
<p>During her appearance before the Commons health committee Thursday, the health minister said funding for such a vaccine is covered by the $1-billion pandemic plan that was developed in 2006. The government also has an $80-million contingency fund for pandemic response that it can draw on if needed.</p>
<p>"I want to reassure this committee that the health and safety of Canadians is our top priority and should we require additional funding in the case of H1N1 ... we will do that. I think Canadians would expect us to do that," said Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer David Butler-Jones told the committee that it's still too soon to know if more funding will be needed to respond to the outbreak.</p>
<p>"At this point we don't know for sure that it will be a pandemic and we don't know for sure even then if it's going to be severe or mild," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu hotline outsourcing draws ire</b>
</div><div>Tom Blackwell   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>502 words</div><div>15 May 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>For weeks now, thousands of New York residents have been calling a state health department hotline to get advice on the swine flu. They likely are unaware that the operators doling out information at the other end are 1,200 kilometres away in Newfoundland, part of an outsourcing contract that has raised the ire of the state employees' beleaguered union.</p>
<p>The hotline job was awarded to Telelink, a Canadian company based in St. John's, partly because of its ability to get the swine-flu service up and running in a matter of hours. It has already fielded 50,000 flu calls.</p>
<p>For the Civil Service Employees Association, however, the outside contract was a red flag after New York's governor threatened to axe 9,000 government jobs to help balance his budget. The work should have been given to some of those workers, said Steve Madarasz, a spokesman for the association, based in Albany, N. Y.</p>
<p>"When the swine flu epidemic came up, they simply did a knee jerk and went to an outside contractor," he said. "If, in fact, we're at a stage where every dollar has to be watched ... was it wise to contract with an outside firm?"</p>
<p>Mr. Madarasz stressed that the union's objections had nothing to do with the fact the contract went to a Canadian company specifically, noting that his association has advocated the state cut costs by purchasing prescription drugs for its employees from here.</p>
<p>The controversy, though, is the latest fallout from the growing trend toward overseas outsourcing of call centre services, as North American utilities, electronics manufacturers and others route customer calls to contractors in locations as far flung as India.</p>
<p>Both the state and the St. John's company itself suggest that the firm was ideally equipped to handle such a short-term job, responding to a fast-developing health issue. Operators are offering up basic information on flu symptoms, preventive measures and other issues according to scripts provided by the state, for a cost of about $50,000. "It's about mobilizing things very easily," said Cindy Roma, Telelink's CEO.</p>
<p>"For any organization to put something up quickly, put together hundreds of lines with lots of people and software ... is very difficult if it's not your business." She also noted that in the competitive call-centre industry, such contracts "float back and forth" across the U. S.-Canada border all the time.</p>
<p>The state turned to Telelink after hiring it earlier to handle a hotline for residents concerned about an outbreak of Hepatitis A in western New York, said Claire Pospisil, a spokeswoman for the health department. Ms. Pospisil said she has heard no complaints about the swineflu line, which is available 24 hours a day and can handle up to 1,500 calls an hour.</p>
<p>"It's been excellent," she said. "They've been able to handle all sorts of different callers."</p>

<p>A student at Vanier College has been confirmed with a case of the H1NI influenza virus. The student is at home recuperating and has not been on the St. Laurent campus since last Friday.</p>
<p>Montreal health officials have assured the college administration that the case is benign and similar to seasonal flu, but is still stressing the importance of having all students and staff take precautions in order to minimize the risk of contracting the flu or spreading it to others.</p>
<p>Hand-washing stations have been installed in 33 locations throughout the college and everyone is encouraged to use them.</p>
<p>The college administration has also asked that anyone experiencing fever and a cough should stay home and contact INFO SANTÉ at 811 for instructions.</p>
<p>Posters have been put up in washrooms with instructions on precautions to take to avoid contracting or spreading the flu.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Asian flu patients' link to Canada hits travel from Japan and China</b>

<div>Vancouver Sun</div>

</p>
<p>(From the Vancouver Sun, May 16, 2009) A May 14 Vancouver Sun article said Japanese delegates backed out of a Hydrogen & Fuel Cells Canada international conference in Vancouver at the end of June due to concerns about the H1N1 virus. Hydrogen & Fuel Cells Canada says that while some Japanese companies have changed their plans, others are still confirmed to attend. ***** </p>
<p>Several cases of H1N1 flu in travellers to Tokyo have put Canada at the top of the national news in Japan and set off a rash of cancellations of travel to B.C.</p>
<p>Those who deal with business to and from China are also on guard, as Beijing on Wednesday focused on its second confirmed case of H1N1 flu in a university student who had flown to Beijing from Toronto via Vancouver.</p>
<p>B.C. announced nine new cases of the H1N1 swine flu virus on Wednesday, bringing the total to 92. There have been no deaths due to the virus in B.C. and everyone who has tested positive has fully recovered or is recovering, health officials say.</p>
<p>While many delegations from China have called off their North American travel plans, some B.C.-based entrepreneurs and executives going the other way are concerned about what might happen if they get caught in Beijing's intense efforts -- rooted in memories of its bungled response to the SARS outbreak five years ago -- to clamp down on any hint of H1N1.</p>
<p>"If even one person on a flight has swine flu or even just cold symptoms when it arrives in Shanghai or Beijing airport, everyone [on the flight] could be quarantined for days, so it's a concern if you are planning to go for a week," said Julia Jiang, a senior consultant at Vancouver-based Canada Swan International Travel, which specializes in trips to China. "The uncertainty of this has people asking a lot of questions. They are booking, but hesitating to have tickets issued."</p>
<p>In Japan, most major trading companies have issued warnings not only on travel to Canada but also within Canada. They're advising against trips between Tokyo and Vancouver, but also Vancouver and Toronto.</p>
<p>There are about 70 to 80 of these companies with offices in Vancouver, according to Hiroyuki Matsuoka, general manager of the Japan External Trade Organization.</p>
<p>He is still expecting a group of small Japanese businesses to show up at EAT! Vancouver, a consumer food and beverage event at B.C. Place next week. But Japanese delegates who were to attend an international fuel-cell conference at the Vancouver Convention Centre at the beginning of June have backed out.</p>
<p>"Generally speaking, executives with larger companies are not traveling here. But the smaller ones have more flexibility with their plans," Matsuoka said.</p>
<p>At Vancouver-based Nippon Travel Agency, head of marketing and planning Midori Adachi is seeing more than 100 cancellations a day of package tours booked by independent travellers. "They can hold their decisions up until 30 days prior [to the trip]; that's when a cancellation charge is applied. So we don't have 50 to 90 per cent of people cancelling, not yet, but we are starting to see it grow each day. They are cancelling June tours now. [Soon], they will cancel July trips."</p>
<p>As for trips booked by students and so-called incentive tours given as perks to high-performing executives, those have been cancelled outright further into the calendar. "We have lots of cancellations, into the summer, even to September," Adachi said. "They have to make a decision three to four months ahead. Some incentive trips are even reviewing itineraries into next year and changing destinations, going to Southeast Asia instead.</p>
<p>"I feel like people are concerned not only of the virus itself, but also of their own reputation -- because if something were to happen, they would have to explain why they chose to go abroad at this time. There is a stigma about going to Canada.</p>
<p>"We are so unlucky. The first case [in Japan], just a suspected one, was a lady from B.C. It was never confirmed, but that put the name of Canada at the top of Japanese news. Then, the first real case was a student from Canada -- so two bad images. Japanese-Canadians here are getting phone calls from their families. 'Don't come here! How are you? Are you wearing masks all day?' There is panic," Adachi said, adding that he hopes, with an important Japanese election looming, "people's [attention] will change to that."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, during the SARS outbreak, "it was Hong Kong, China and Canada. Every time they announced it in Japan, they would show a map of the world with Canada and China in red, so both whole countries were danger zones as far as the Japanese were concerned. This time, it's very similar," said Gordon Kadota, a Vancouver-based businessman who has for years advised the B.C. government on how to build tourism from Japan.</p>
<p>This week, Kadota is entertaining an alumni group from his alma mater in Japan. The plan was to visit Seattle for a Mariners baseball game, but "two participants who work with Mitsui Cargo have received orders from [their] head office not to travel anywhere here" so they will have to stay behind.</p>

</p>
<p>Look, we have known each other for quite a while now, so I don't think there's any point beating around the bush, if you catch my metaphorical drift.</p>
<p>I KNOW you have read the story.</p>
<p>And you KNOW that I KNOW that you have read the story.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm pretty sure that everyone you know and everyone I know has read the story and knows that you and I know that they know that we know they have read the story, too.</p>
<p>I could go on, but I think you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Don't give me that innocent look. You know what I'm talking about. What I am talking about is THE story, the one that appeared on Page 2 of Tuesday's paper, directly under my insightful column about the dangers posed by serious earwax buildup.</p>
<p>It ran under the following headline: "City couple discovers rodent in stir-fry."</p>
<p>As serious, concerned, compassionate newspaper readers, I am confident your informed reaction to this news item was the same as mine, namely: "Ha ha ha!"</p>
<p>But it is also possible, assuming you were eating breakfast at the time, that your reaction was deeper, possibly along the lines of: "BLUUUUUUUUUURRRRGGHHHH!!!"</p>
<p>This story states that a Winnipeg couple went for lunch at a shopping mall food court over the weekend and, while poking through their chicken mushroom stir-fry, made a shocking discovery -- a pair of winning lottery tickets.</p>
<p>Just kidding. The couple claim they found what appeared to be two baby rodents in their stir-fry, despite the fact that they were not listed on the menu. The restaurant has since been given the all-clear, but the couple had not turned over the "rodent samples" because -- and you are going to be very surprised by this development -- they wanted to speak to a lawyer first.</p>
<p>Now I know what you are thinking. You are thinking: "Doug, is it possible you are overreacting to a single possible case of possible stir-fried rodents in an effort to capitalize on the huge buzz being generated by this alleged incident?"</p>
<p>Well, let me just take a moment here to assure you that you are, in fact, completely correct.</p>
<p>Since being posted on our website, the stir-fried rodents story has been viewed by tens of thousands of concerned readers. It got about FIVE TIMES as many hits as any other story. In fact, it cracked the Top Ten most-viewed stories this year.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised. This issue has been of great concern to newspaper readers throughout history, as we see from the words of this famous nursery rhyme:</p>
<p>Stir-fried mice, stir-fried mice</p>
<p>See how they wok, see how they wok</p>
<p>They all wokked into some food court rice</p>
<p>We put them on Page 2 in half a trice</p>
<p>Did you ever read such a story in your life</p>
<p>As stir-fried mice, stir-fried mice</p>
<p>Clearly, the popularity of this story makes an important statement about the state of our society. Unfortunately, I haven't got a clue what that statement is.</p>
<p>What I do know is the message to journalists such as myself is clear: Forget thoughtful, informative items on swine flu, the recession, international terrorism and the NHL playoffs. What modern journalists need to do to satisfy readers is, whenever possible, work the words "STIR-FRIED RODENTS" into stories, preferably using big block letters.</p>
<p>So that's what I planned to do today. By way of research, I Googled the words "stir-fried rodents" and got something like 12,000 hits, including recipes I cannot share in a family newspaper.</p>
<p>What I can share are a couple of other alarming stories we need to fret about, such as the fellow in Italy who, apparently on the very same day as the stir-fried rodents incident, bit into a sandwich in a hospital cafeteria and discovered... a forgotten painting by Michelangelo.</p>
<p>Again, I'm kidding. When Giuseppe Ferri bit into his "cheese and tomato sandwich" he found a secret ingredient -- a dead lizard. "I looked down and saw a lizard tail sticking out of the side of the sandwich," he is quoted as saying.</p>
<p>In our next alarming incident, according to the Albany Times, a New York man regretted changing his side order from chips to vegetables after finding a snake's head in his, gasp, broccoli.</p>
<p>"I could see these black, rotted eye sockets on top," the diner is quoted as saying, "I told my girlfriend, 'I think this is a head.' "</p>
<p>So, clearly we are dealing with a worldwide epidemic. For now, I recommend we steer clear of ANY food that even remotely resembles a rodent or a reptile.</p>
<p>Personally, I would start with broccoli.</p>

</p>
<p>TWO new cases of H1N1 flu have been confirmed in Manitoba, raising the total reported so far to four, the province said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Both individuals had mild symptoms and were not hospitalized," public health officials said in a news bulletin.</p>
<p>It provided no additional information about the individuals.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a Winnipeg woman, in her 50s, became the province's second confirmed case. The woman, who has a pre-existing medical condition, was being treated in hospital. She had not travelled to Mexico and there is no evidence she had been in contact with someone who had travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>"The H1N1 flu virus has been present in Manitoba for at least two weeks and more cases of H1N1 flu are expected to occur," the province said in its bulletin Wednesday. "As with any influenza type, most cases are expected to be mild and result in a full recovery although some cases are expected to be severe."</p>
<p>The government said routine precautionary measures, such as covering a cough or sneeze and washing your hands often, and generally leading a healthy lifestyle can prevent the spread of the illness or reduce its effects.</p>

<p>When Ernest Schmid rolled out of bed Wednesday morning, he was struck by a bolt of inspiration. He ran to the nearest T-shirt shop and had a custom shirt made just for the day.</p>
<p>Sitting on the grass outside the McDougall Centre a few hours later, he's proudly wearing his new shirt that reads "Oink! Oink! Until My Last Breath I love my Alberta Swine," and chomping down on a tasty bun filled with pulled pork.</p>
<p>Poetic it's not. But Schmid's impromptu slogan, he says, represents his passion for our province's fifth-largest agri-food export.</p>
<p>"I love pork and I think what's happened is a shame," says the 67-year-old retired salesman. "My wife and I thought we'd come down and show our support by doing something a little different."</p>
<p>Doing something different is what the folks at Alberta Pork have embraced. In an event coined "Porkapalooza" by some observers, they have brought enough free pork on a bun to feed 2,000 people over the lunch hour. After the 1,500 free meals ran out at their Edmonton event the day before, they hedged their bets and brought along enough to feed an extra 500 hungry mouths.</p>
<p>By 11 a. m., it's clear the event is a hit, as people line up in the hundreds; by 11:45 a. m., more than 1,500 have already saddled up to the troughs for a free early lunch.</p>
<p>Looking over the scene, Ben Woolley can't help but smile.</p>
<p>"I think this is a great way to show everyone that people haven't lost confidence in pork as a safe food product," says the Acme pork producer and vice-chairman of the Alberta Pork Producers Alliance. "What better way to make that point than by having thousands turn out for a pork lunch?"</p>
<p>Sure, it's a bit of a manipulative tactic--anyone who knows anything about Calgarians is well aware we aren't daunted by long lineups whenever there's a free meal, especially one involving the tantalizing aromas of cooked meat. But desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>
<p>This year, as the good lady on our $20 bills once quipped, has been an "annus horribilus" for the Canadian pork industry. After three bad years due first to a high Canadian dollar, and then the recession, it was recently dealt a near-death blow thanks to the swine flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Although the name of the virus was changed to H1N1 influenza not long after the outbreak in April, the damage was done: widespread misconceptions about the origins of the virus had spread from individual consumers to entire countries. Earlier this month, China, along with a handful of other countries, banned Alberta pork exports--which are valued at about $400 million in the export market alone--after the Canadian Food Inspection Agency quarantined 2,200 hogs on a central Alberta farm when a farm worker who'd just returned from Mexico exposed the herd to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>No matter that the World Health Organization is telling them the virus isn't transmitted by eating pork in this textbook case of hysteria winning out over fact; the pork industry is in big trouble, and people like Woolley aren't afraid to admit it.</p>
<p>"We've suffered through 30 months of low market prices, and then this had to happen," says Woolley, an expat Brit who's been in the pork producing business all of his adult life. "People are literally losing their farms because of bad information."</p>
<p>But he's determined to stay optimistic.</p>
<p>"I think we're doing a good job at getting the word out that pork is safe to eat," he says, smiling at the hoards of people, from all walks of life, partaking in the free lunch. "I'm confident that we'll start to see a turnaround in the next while."</p>
<p>While it's clear that many here braving the chilly May morning are just out for a freebie, many of the participants openly declare that they're also making a public statement by their presence --voting with their appetites.</p>
<p>"I went out this weekend and made sure I bought some pork at the grocery store," says 28-yearold Jennifer Bruoker, who, along with fellow employees at the downtown bank where she works, is one of the first people in line.</p>
<p>"I don't usually have lunch at 11 a. m., but I wanted to show my support. It's ridiculous that the industry has been hit so hard by something that's not even true."</p>
<p>Even those latecomers arriving at the usual noon lunch hour aren't disappointed: at the last minute, caterers on the scene come up with more buns, with the final tally of free meals at over 3,000.</p>
<p>But for those who missed it, says Roy Kruse, director of consumer services for Alberta Pork, who has been handing out free pork cookbooks all morning, it's definitely not too late to show your support for this beleaguered industry.</p>
<p>"There's plenty of pork in the grocery stores, just in time for barbecue season."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>This season's Stanley Cup playoffs have been wild 'n' crazy; Game 7s usually a treat, although Wednesday's game was disappointing</b>
</div><div>John MacKinnon   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>1027 words</div><div>14 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>It was George Orwell who dismissed international sport as "war minus the shooting."</p>
<p>Which proves ol' Georgie was no hockey fan because the second round of the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs has been a wild, crazy shooting gallery -- pucks coming from everywhere, among many other wonderful things.</p>
<p>The shots have come at warp speed, from all angles, capping off brilliant passing plays, solo sorties, odd-man rushes, backhands and forehands.</p>
<p>All by himself, Russian star Alexander Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals had rifled 87 pucks at opposing goalies in 13 playoff games entering play Wednesday. And 12 of those came in the same extraordinary game in which he and rival Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins rang up matching hat tricks back on May 4.</p>
<p>Things unravelled for Ovechkin and the Capitals in Game 7 on Wednesday night, but that can't invalidate the series as a whole, which was a classic.</p>
<p>The defending champion Detroit Red Wings have been letting pucks fly at Anaheim Ducks goalie Jonas Hiller at a rate well north of 40 shots a game. In Game 2 of that Western Conference series, the Wings fired 62 shots at Hiller in a 4-3, triple-overtime Detroit loss.</p>
<p>It has been a spectacular second round of the NHL playoffs and it comes at a splendid time for many, rest assured. If sport is religion and religion, as Marx noted, is "the opiate of the masses," well, some of us sure could use a consciousness-altering fix these days.</p>
<p>We're getting almost a maximum dose, too, with three of four series going the seven-game distance, and with the star players, especially Ovechkin and Crosby, but including Eric Staal, Patrice Bergeron, Tim Thomas, Phil Kessel, Scott Niedermayer, Johan Franzen, delivering thrilling performances nightly.</p>
<p>For me, surrendering my evenings to the second round of the Stanley Cup has been a necessary escape from all manner of ennui within the world of hockey and without.</p>
<p>Tuesday night, I shouldered my way up Jasper Avenue through a</p>
<p>truly demoralizing mid-May blizzard. It was a welcome balm to watch the Boston Bruins send their Eastern Conference semifinal to a seventh game against the Carolina Hurricanes, who held a 3-1 series lead an eyeblink ago.</p>
<p>Viewing Anaheim's 2-1 victory over Detroit a little later sure helped flush stray thoughts of former prime minister Brian Mulroney explaining, with a straight face, why his 20-year-old exercises in "cuttin' up the cash" with Karl-Heinz Schreiber involved no tedious paperwork.</p>
<p>Not to mention swine flu, global economic recession and U.S. President Barack Obama ramping up the war effort in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>You know, the small stuff.</p>
<p>The games were even compelling enough to clear the screen, at least temporarily, of the machinations of Jim Balsillie, the buccaneer billionaire who is using a U.S. bankruptcy court, as well as the court of Canadian public opinion, to try to snatch an NHL franchise from the Sun Belt and move it to southern Ontario -- speaking of war without the shooting.</p>
<p>For me, the nightly on-ice spectacle has been so riveting that even the sorry season windup of the Edmonton Oilers seems a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>It's also true that watching the gifted young Chicago Blackhawks dance to victory past deficits of two or more goals with regularity puts that 9-2 shellacking of the Oilers back on Dec. 16 in truly sobering perspective. No wonder that this season more than one million fans (22,578 on average) took in the Blackhawks act, an act that not so long ago was deservedly playing to a half-empty house.</p>
<p>As the hockey world learns just how good Patrick Kane, Jonathan Toews, Duncan Keith, et al can be, now and going forward, their collective talent level seems several orbits above that of the Oilers. Frightening, that ... if you're an Oilers fan.</p>
<p>But then, the Oilers are among a six-pack of Canadian-based teams who all must retool, some considerably, to get back to the league's elite eight, let alone the final four, let alone actually win the Cup for the first time since the Canadiens last brought it north of the 49th parallel in 1993.</p>
<p>Precisely how the Oilers, in particular, propose to bridge the massive gap between themselves and the Blackhawks, Ducks, Red Wings, Penguins, Bruins, Capitals, et al is an important question, and a vexing one, for Edmonton general manager Steve Tambellini and his staff.</p>
<p>It's just not my question. Mine is: Who's playing Game 7 tonight?</p>
<p>That would be Boston vs. Carolina, and Detroit vs. Anaheim, the past two Stanley Cup winners.</p>
<p>The last time the previous two Cup champions met in a seventh game was in 1991, when the defending champion Oilers -- hey, does that phrase ring a bell? -- knocked off the '89 champion Calgary Flames. In overtime, no less.</p>
<p>By the way, chances are good that one of tonight's Game 7 offerings will go into extra time, too.</p>
<p>Of 126 Game 7s in NHL history, 30 have gone to overtime.</p>
<p>Going forward, there will be plenty of time to puzzle over the plight of the retrograde Oilers; address the NHL's persistent romancing of needless on-ice violence; sort out how to fix money-losing franchises in Phoenix, Atlanta and Tampa Bay, for starters; not to mention assemble a Team Canada that can cope with Ovechkin, Evgeni Malkin, Pavel Datsyuk, Alexander Radulov, and company at the 2010 Olympics.</p>
<p>But right now it's time to be in the moment and the moment is a pair of Game 7s.</p>
<p>As the Stanley Cup second round has rolled, it does not get much better.</p>

<p>Organizers of the International Children's Festival have cancelled a show based out of Mexico City in response to global concerns about the spread of the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>"After taking into account reports and recommendations from the World Health Organization and our local health authorities as well, we decided to err on the side of caution and just postpone the show," festival director Nancy Abrahamson said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Marionetas de la Esquina, which performs the show Emilio and the Enchanted Cow, will be replaced with additional shows by Canadian children's performer Al Simmons. The cancelled show has been rebooked for the 2011 festival.</p>
<p>"While it's unfortunate children will have to wait until 2011 to see Emilio and the Enchanted Cow, we're thrilled to have the opportunity to extend Al Simmons' run at this year's festival. Al is a festival favourite who has earned a reputation as one of Canada's most beloved and inventive children's performers," Abrahamson said.</p>
<p>People holding pre-paid tickets for Emilio and the Enchanted Cow will be contacted and told of the cancellation.</p>
<p>They can opt instead to buy tickets to Simmons's show.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the province reported eight new cases of the H1N1 flu Wednesday, bringing the provincial total to 61 cases.</p>
<p>All of the new patients -- four adults and four children from across Alberta -- have mild symptoms, and their travel histories have yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Alberta has had only two serious cases of the flu in Canada. A 39-year-old woman from the Gift Lake Métis Settlement died in hospital after catching the virus from unknown sources.</p>
<p>The investigation continues to determine if the flu caused her death, the only one in Canada since the outbreak began, and what part the woman's asthma and diabetes may have played.</p>
<p>A girl is still recovering in an Edmonton-area hospital, but is still not well enough to be discharged.</p>
<p>There have been a total of 358 cases of the flu in Canada.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Scientist arrested at border with stolen Ebola vials; 'The only thing he could have done with it is make an Ebola vaccine'</b>
</div><div>Canwest News Service</div>

</p>
<p>A Canadian scientist was stopped at the U.S. border last week after authorities found 22 vials used in Ebola research from Canada's National Microbiology Lab in his possession, officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The incident has sparked serious questions about security protocols at the Winnipeg lab that contains some of the world's most deadliest pathogens.</p>
<p>Konan Michel Yao, 42, was apprehended by U.S. officials as he attempted to enter the United States at the Pembina, N.D., border crossing from Manitoba on May 5.</p>
<p>Yao faces U.S. criminal charges for smuggling and is currently in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Ser-vice.</p>
<p>Yao was carrying unidentified biological materials in vials wrapped in aluminum foil inside a glove, wrapped in a plastic bag in the trunk of his car, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol spokesman Mike Milne told the Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Plummer, scientific director general of the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, said the vials did not contain any infectious pathogens.</p>
<p>"At no time was the health of citizens of Canada or the U.S. at risk, as the seized materials are known to be non-infectious," he said.</p>
<p>FBI special agent E.K. Wilson said federal officials were initially called in to investigate whether the man smuggled the vials for bio-terrorism.</p>
<p>Documents allege the researcher said he knew he needed special clearance to transport the materials into the U.S., but did not have a permit.</p>
<p>Plummer said Yao was working at the agency's special pathogens laboratory on an Ebola vaccine project when his research term ended.</p>
<p>"There was a small amount of genetic material from the Ebola virus in the material that he took off with, but it posed no risk of infection and no risk to the health of the public," he said.</p>
<p>"It's basically genetic material, some of which had an Ebola gene in it. It's just a gene. It's not infectious. The only thing he could have done with it was make an Ebola vaccine."</p>
<p>Yao never had access to Level 3 and 4 pathogens, such as the swine flu virus, HIV and Ebola virus, Plummer said. He had Level 2 clearance and "only worked with non-infectious materials."</p>
<p>Yao said in an affidavit obtained by Reuters that he took the vials when he left the lab at the end of his contract on Jan. 21, to help him get a head start on his research at his new job at a U.S. disease research lab.</p>
<p>Canada's public health agency did not know the vials were missing until it was contacted by the RCMP, which had been alerted by U.S. border services, Plummer said.</p>
<p>The matter has also been referred to the Winnipeg Police Service.</p>

<p>Long before the swine flu emerged as a public health threat, a B.C.-based scientist was working toward an antiviral weapon to combat both swine and avian flu.</p>
<p>Steven Jones, associate director of the Genome Sciences Centre and a professor at both Simon Fraser University and the University of B.C., began working two years ago with a team of researchers to identify molecular compounds that could destroy the deadly strains of influenza.</p>
<p>After examining hundreds of thousands of molecular compounds, Jones and two teams of researchers here and in Hong Kong identified a single molecular compound that could, eventually, be developed into an antiviral drug that would serve as an alternative to Tamiflu and Relenza. Tamiflu has been effective in treating the flu viruses, but resistance to the drug is developing.</p>
<p>"Essentially, we need more arrows in our quiver," Jones said Tuesday in a phone interview.</p>
<p>"We need to learn more about the things that will stop these viruses from replicating."</p>
<p>Using 200 computers that worked non-stop for a week processing hundreds of thousands pieces of data, Jones and his team at the B.C. Cancer Agency's Genome Sciences Centre came up with 20 molecular compounds that could theoretically interfere with the protein structures of the influenza virus.</p>
<p>Those compounds were sent to a team of researchers at the University of Hong Kong's Cytokine Biology Group, where further testing showed only one of the 20 was potentially effective.</p>
<p>"One of them worked. One of them did actually stop the replication of the virus," Jones said.</p>
<p>The discovery needs far more development before it becomes an applicable antiviral drug, including testing on animals and humans.</p>
<p>"There are lots of hurdles that this molecule would have to pass before becoming a drug," Jones said.</p>
<p>"It would be a long process . . . in the realm of five years or more. It's not going to be a drug tomorrow."</p>
<p>But Jones noted that scientists in B.C. and around the world are working constantly to find weapons against influenza viruses.</p>
<p>"The bottom line is that there is activity and these things are happening," he said.</p>
<p>"We need to be working on these things all the time, not just when there is an outbreak."</p>

<p>One week after Ottawa reported its first confirmed case of the Mexican swine flu, the total number of cases in the city has risen to seven. According to Ottawa Public Health, the latest cases have followed the pattern of the vast majority discovered in Ontario involving patients with mild symptoms who did not need to be hospitalized. "We continue to anticipate that additional cases of novel H1N1 Influenza A virus will be confirmed in the city," said Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's chief medical officer. The latest Ottawa cases bring the provincial total to 119.</p>

<p>Last week, I popped into a drug store to buy shampoo and toothpaste.</p>
<p>All through the store, there were tables with stocks of hand sanitizer, and signs out imploring all customers coming into the store to disinfect their hands. The air was filled with the smell of fake watermelon, fake grapefruit, fake cucumber, and all the other esters that are supposed to cover up that acrid hand sanitizer smell.</p>
<p>As I paid for my purchases, the clerk tried to sell me hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>"We're almost sold out," she whispered conspiratorially. "These are our last three bottles. Buy it while you still can."</p>
<p>A couple days later, I stopped by a Mexican-style take-out restaurant to pick up a burrito for lunch. On the counter was a sign, assuring customers that even though the restaurant had a Mexican name, its food was safe and flu-free.</p>
<p>I'll admit, my first temptation is to make fun of all the people who've succumbed to swine flu fever. But really, that's a little unfair. It's hard to blame people for being nervous when the media, the marketers, the politicians and even the World Health Organization have spent the last two weeks whipping up fears about H1N1 as a global pandemic.</p>
<p>The wonder is that more people weren't more spooked.</p>
<p>Alberta officials have been taking a lot of political heat for their handling of the H1N1 outbreak in that province. They've been chastised for not being more forthcoming with information about victims, for not notifying parents whose children attend school with kids who've become ill, for not closing schools, for not telling the press immediately when a northern Alberta woman with chronic respiratory problems died after catching the flu.</p>
<p>But I'm not sure that criticism is warranted.</p>
<p>So far, H1N1 has shown itself no more virulent, deadly, or contagious than the seasonal flu bugs we see most winters.</p>
<p>Imagine the chaos, if we closed an elementary school every time some kid showed up with influenza or Norovirus. Imagine the fear, if every parent were notified in writing of every classmate's sniffle.</p>
<p>Despite the international media hype, we are not facing some latter-day Andromeda Strain, or even a repeat of the deadly SARS outbreak. Even if this influenza were more serious, we'd still need to be making decisions on the basis of the best scientific and medical advice -- not for political reasons.</p>
<p>Swine flu, or H1N1, or whatever we want to call it, is frightening people mostly because it's new. And because we've all been told for years now that one day, some big bad flu pandemic, akin to the great Spanish Influenza, was going to hit and kill millions. Unfortunately for those trying to sell hand sanitizer, and newspapers, this ain't no Spanish flu.</p>
<p>That's not to say that H1N1 isn't worth monitoring, as a new and exotic influenza mutation. It has spread broadly and quickly, infecting people (and pigs) who've never been to Mexico, and making a very few extremely ill indeed.</p>
<p>But in some ways, it is the virus's relative mildness that has let it spread so far and wide.</p>
<p>If it made people sicker, they'd stay in bed, instead of boarding planes or going to work.</p>
<p>A truly ghastly virus like Ebola, for example, doesn't spread quickly or far, because it kills its victims so swiftly. The common cold, on the other hand, spreads like crazy, because we shrug it off, and go out and sneeze on people. Luckily for us, and unluckily for those in the fear-fanning business, this Mexican bug has far more in common with the latter than the former.</p>
<p>We could look at the last couple of weeks as a useful drill for health-care workers, to practice their epidemic protocols.</p>
<p>Someday, there probably will be a truly deadly flu mutation, one that will indeed call for us to go into lockdown mode.</p>
<p>But when it comes, will people be so bored, so fatigued by false alarms, that they miss the warning signs of the big one when it really comes?</p>
<p>Just as bacterial infections can evolve to be antibiotic-resistant, might we evolve socially, to be resistant to recognizing real risk when it arrives?</p>
<p>So here's my cheery prescription. Instead of feeding on fear, why not feed on pork? If you're not Jewish, Muslim, vegetarian or otherwise pork-averse, this would be an excellent time to show your support for pig farmers, large and small, who've been victimized by irrational international import bans, and decreased local demand.</p>
<p>I feel particularly sorry for Alberta farmer Arnold Van Ginkel, who played by the rules and reported his sick pigs, instead of taking the "shoot, shovel and shut up" approach -- and who is now paying a heavy price for his probity.</p>

<p>Hamilton hospitals are detecting swine flu five times faster than other hospitals, with a test created by a local doctor.</p>
<p>The rapid test -- only being used in Hamilton -- gets results in six to 24 hours, compared with waiting up to five days for the public health laboratory to confirm H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"They're extremely fast," said Dr. Chris Mackie, associate medical officer of health, about the hospitals' regional laboratory.</p>
<p>"Excellent, excellent turnaround times in that lab."</p>
<p>The test was created on the fly in three days by Dr. Jim Mahony so local hospitals would know right away what drugs to give patients with influenza symptoms and whether they need isolation rooms and other precautions such as special masks for staff.</p>
<p>"It's unbelievably fast," said Dr. Mark Crowther, acting chief of laboratory medicine for St. Joseph's Healthcare and <span class="companylink">Hamilton Health Sciences</span>.</p>
<p>"We're able to very quickly ascertain whether the person has this or not."</p>
<p>That's crucial for local hospitals, which are short of beds and cash.</p>
<p>"With anybody who has a serious respiratory illness, we take special precautions ... and we have a limited capacity to do that," said Crowther.</p>
<p>"If you have a patient who is in isolation for five days waiting for a test, it clogs up beds."</p>
<p>Hamilton and Halton had no new cases of swine flu yesterday. The numbers continued to rise in Ontario with six more ill, bringing the province's total to 119 cases -- all mild -- including two in Hamilton and 11 in Halton.</p>
<p>The province's central public health laboratory in Toronto is handling all tests for H1N1, causing backlogs because of the large volume of work that needs to be done.</p>
<p>Faced with waits of up to five days, Hamilton's hospitals started using Mahony's test at the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>The Hamilton virologist is well known as the inventor of another rapid test approved this year in Canada and the United States and used around the world -- but not in Hamilton -- called the xTag Respiratory Viral Panel.</p>
<p>That test detects 20 respiratory viruses, from the common cold to SARS to avian flu, in six hours.</p>
<p>Its maker, <span class="companylink">Luminex Corporation</span>, announced this month it's also effective at detecting swine flu.</p>
<p>Mahony revised the test to focus solely on influenza using samples of H1N1 sent to him from the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It quickly determines whether a patient has influenza, and if so, what type. Those results are later confirmed by the public health laboratory.</p>
<p>Hamilton's hospitals don't normally use Mahony's test because it costs two to three times more than conventional methods.</p>
<p>But they're making an exception for the revised influenza test.</p>
<p>"We have absolutely no idea how we're going to pay for it," said Crowther. "The situation is sufficiently important that we worry about that afterwards."</p>

</p>
<p>BEIJING -- China confirmed its second case of H1N1 yesterday - a 19-year-old Chinese national who was attending university in Canada and arrived in Beijing Friday on board Air Canada Flight AC029.</p>
<p>The flight originated from Toronto, but Chinese officials believe the student boarded the plane during a stopover in Vancouver.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health identified the student only by his surname of Lu and said he had been in quarantine since Monday.</p>
<p>Authorities are trying to track down any passengers from the flight which departed from Toronto last Thursday and were seated in rows 32 to 38.</p>
<p>This morning, China's largest cellphone service provider, China Mobile, issued an emergency text message to its countless millions of users to immediately inform authorities if they knew of anyone who had been aboard the flight.</p>
<p>Lu apparently began experiencing a fever Sunday accompanied by symptoms of sore throat and headache, it said.</p>
<p>However, he then boarded a train Monday bound for Jinan, the capital of Shandong province.</p>
<p>The student reported to the Jinan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on the train, and was subsequently sent to hospital for isolation and treatment.</p>
<p>Tests done Tuesday showed he was a "suspected positive" for the H1N1 virus, which had previously been labelled as swine flu. The case was confirmed after further tests.</p>
<p>No information had been released about where in Canada he had been living or which school he had attended.</p>

<p>Toronto's Pan Am bid officials are still waiting to submit their final proposal to host the 2015 games - as the bidding process has been delayed by the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico.</p>
<p>The bid book, which outlines specific plans for the games including venues, transportation and housing details, was supposed to be hand-delivered to Mario Vazquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports Organization, in late April.</p>
<p>But bid chair David Peterson and Michael Chambers, Canadian Olympic Committee president and CEO, cancelled their trip to Mexico City when the April 30 bid deadline was put off, and Mexico suspended public events and ordered residents to stay home to contain the flu virus.</p>
<p>It turns out Vazquez Rana's toddler grandson - who was visiting Texas with family - became the first H1N1 fatality in the U.S. when he died in a Houston hospital on April 27.</p>
<p>Miguel Tejada Vazquez, who was not quite 2, was the youngest child of Vazquez Rana's daughter, Miriam.</p>
<p>Vazquez Rana is a wealthy businessman who owns a media empire in Mexico. A member of the International Olympic Committee, he has headed the Pan Am organization for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>"It's very sad. It's a small, small world," said Chambers.</p>
<p>Peterson said no date has been set for them to make a formal presentation to Vazquez Rana, but the bid book is ready. It will also go to Premier Dalton McGuinty and Prime Minister Stephen Harper.</p>
<p>Toronto's bid involves cities from across the Golden Horseshoe. Toronto is up against Bogota, Colombia, and Lima, Peru.</p>
<p>The 42-member Pan American Sports Organization will probably pick a winner in November.</p>

<p>At Monday's 111th annual Island Farms Victoria Day Parade there will be fewer American bands due to the economic downturn. Last year 120,000 people turned out to see the big parade featuring 32 bands from south of the border.</p>
<p>This year, there will be only 19 bands from the U.S., but the parade will still be almost three hours long due to increased participation by local entrants. Beginning at 9 a.m. bands will march down Douglas Street in a showcase of local pride that includes massive floats, clowns and community groups.</p>
<p>This year, Polish-Canadian and Swedish-Canadian organizations join other inter-cultural groups including participants from the Chinese-Canadian and South Korean communities. A group from Victoria's sister city, Morioka, Japan, was a last minute cancellation because of the swine flu epidemic.</p>
<p>"There will be a lot of very good Canadian floats in this year's parade," said Ron Butlin, who has organized the big event for the past 17 years.</p>
<p>"I really admire the Americans who are coming despite the economic downturn. One family put up $10,000 to help pay for the accommodation and food for one Washington state high school band."</p>

<p>Health officials have confirmed a swine flu case on board a cruise ship that will dock in Victoria tomorrow.</p>
<p>Two crew members, a man and a woman, on board the Royal Caribbean Lines cruise ship Serenade of the Seas developed flu-like symptoms said Cynthia Martinez, spokeswoman for the cruise line.</p>
<p>The ship had stopped at two Mexican ports before the U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued a travel warning in connection in the H1N1 virus, also known as the swine flu.</p>
<p>The woman tested positive, said Tim Church, spokesman for the Washington state public health laboratory, which administered the test because she became ill while the ship was sailing through Washington waters.</p>
<p>The man had become sick earlier while the ship was passing through California waters. Both are recovering.</p>
<p>"It was a pretty low-key situation in Washington," Church said, adding there has been 250 confirmed swine flu cases and one death where swine flu was a contributing factor.</p>
<p>Dr. Murray Fyfe, medical health officer for the Vancouver Island Health Authority, said that even if the woman was in contact with other crew and passengers while contagious, the risk to residents would be low as the outside incubation period for swine flu is seven days.</p>
<p>"I can't see this being a big risk for people in Victoria at all," he said.</p>

</p>
<p>Rain, rain go away.</p>
<p>Once again, thousands of cruise ship passengers visiting Victoria huddled under hoods and umbrellas thanks to wet weather yesterday. Many lined up on Government Street to ride tour buses while others packed into souvenir shops.</p>
<p>Local businesses have been looking forward to Wednesdays since the two largest cruise ships ever to visit Ogden Point announced they were detouring to Victoria. Royal Caribbean's Mariner of the Seas and the Carnival Splendor have booked moorage for several Wednesdays, from noon to 10 p.m., rather than visiting Mexico, as earlier planned, because of swine flu worries.</p>
<p>Steady rain greeted passengers on May 6, the first stop by these large ships, which can each carry close to 3,000 passengers. Some stores and attractions were busy with shoppers, but others were quiet.</p>
<p>Buskers were out yesterday with violins, drums and guitars on Government Street to take advantage of the extra numbers. Some businesses are staying open later and bringing in extra staff.</p>
<p>Starting this week, the downtown Bay Centre is extending its Wednesday hours from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. to serve cruise ship passengers.</p>
<p>Joan and Tony Esse, of Walnut, Calif., didn't mind the cloudy skies. "It's great," Joan Esse said, adding that it was too hot at home. She had checked the forecast before booking the cruise so she knew what to expect.</p>
<p>The couple took advantage of a "good price" on fares after the Mariner of the Seas was rerouted, she said. Fellow passengers are fine with the weather, she said. "We knew we weren't going to Mexico."</p>
<p>Standing under a Government Street store awning, a smiling Tony Esse said, "It is beautiful. We love walking in the rain."</p>
<p>On a brighter note, Environment Canada's forecast for early next week shows sunny skies on Tuesday with high temperatures of about 20 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Even before the two big ships announced they were coming to Victoria, the number of planned cruise ship visits set a record this year. A total of 235 visits are now expected at Ogden Point.</p>
<p>Cruise ship stops are estimated to pump millions of dollars in direct and indirect spending into the local economy.</p>
<p>At Stormtech Performance Apparel on Government Street, general manager Bob Cherney said it was a "decent day, but not a stellar day."</p>
<p>Sales for this month are running ahead of the same month in 2008, he said, attributing the improved numbers to ship passengers. "If that's an indication of what lies ahead for the summer, we'll be pretty happy campers."</p>
<p>However, Cherney is finding that the redirected cruises present "a different demographic, so we are seeing different results than we anticipated."</p>
<p>Passengers who took advantage of attractive low fares are less inclined to shop, he said.</p>

</div><div>Jeff Bell   </div>

</p>
<p>The swine flu appears to be making its mark on the Sooke school district's bottom line.</p>
<p>Concerns from abroad about the virus have been curtailing participation in Sooke's international-student programs this summer. The summer offerings bring in about $50,000 each year.</p>
<p>"The international program is having some cancellations because of H1N1," said assistant superintendent Ron Warder. "A number of small groups have pulled back or are thinking of pulling back."</p>
<p>The effects of the H1N1 influenza strain were part of the discussions this week when Sooke trustees put the finishing touches on a $73,608,052 budget document for 2009-10. Warder said the big concern is whether or not the flu will have an effect on programs next year.</p>
<p>"We depend on about a quarter of a million dollars net revenue from international-student programs."</p>
<p>Warder said flu issues have settled down since Hans Helgesen Elementary School was closed for a few days earlier this month over the possibility that some of its students had the H1N1 virus. Tests for the virus were negative.</p>
<p>Another budget item attracting attention is busing. The cost of riding the bus has gone up and some of the smaller routes have been cut to pare expenses.</p>
<p>"The combination of route changes and increased revenues is $150,000," Warder said. The annual cost per student for busing has gone from $60 to $120, or the equivalent of $12 per month. A discount applies when more than two children from one family take the bus. Warder said the district charged $120 per year in 2002, after provincial funding for the service was frozen.</p>
<p>"We were making money at that time, so we reduced the fees to $60. Now we've had to put it back up to $120, because we're in a deficit with increased costs."</p>
<p>Even with the increases, the district is still short $210,000 in the transportation budget. About 2,400 students have been riding the buses this year.</p>
<p>Stephanie Longstaff of the Sooke Parents Education Advisory Council, who has three children regularly taking the bus, said consistent policies about where the buses go and who they pick up are her group's main transportation issues.</p>
<p>"SPEAC's big issue with busing is the inconsistencies.</p>
<p>"We had a lot of people come forward and say they didn't mind paying the fees as long as they were going to get decent bus service."</p>
<p>Saanich trustees also raised bus fees in their 2009-10 budget, increasing them $8 to $20 a month.</p>

<p>Following is the viewpoint of the writer, who works for Beyond Factory Farming, a national advocacy group for socially responsible livestock production in Canada.</p>
<p>Pigs are taking the rap for the global outbreak of swine flu, but the pandemic never was their fault. Influenza is a social disease and the pandemic is a social phenomenon. We're now in the thick of it, and public health agencies around the world are working to minimize suffering and limit deaths.</p>
<p>By taking the time to understand the social factors of influenza, we will be better equipped to prevent recurrences.</p>
<p>Swine flu is merely the latest symptom of a chronic economic disease that's characterized by corporate control of food production, exploitation of workers and animals, financial speculation and aggressive global trading.</p>
<p>In Mexico, as in Canada and the United States, hog production underwent massive structural change over the last 25 years, based on policies designed to ramp up production, shift it to vertically integrated corporations and sell our product to other countries cheaper than they can produce it themselves. Communities once self-reliant in food production now depend on imports. Globalization remodelled agriculture into agribusiness, and food became merely another global commodity.</p>
<p>In the past, most North American hogs were raised on family farms dispersed throughout the countryside. Hogs were butchered on farms, at local abattoirs or regional packing plants. Supply and demand were pretty much in balance, and there was little for export.</p>
<p>U.S.-based <span class="companylink">Murphy Farms</span> (bought out by Smithfield during the 1990s) was the first company to start raising hogs indoors, using an assembly line approach. The company grew and continued to increase market share quickly. Soon other companies were emulating Murphy, and factory hog farming took off. This production model arrived in Quebec around 1994 and spread to the rest of Canada as federal and provincial policies and regulations were amended to encourage expansion.</p>
<p>Where once a large hog farm boasted 100 sows, 5,000-sow operations that produce tens of thousands of hogs per year soon became the norm. Smaller outfits went bankrupt.</p>
<p>A few small, diversified farms continue to raise smaller numbers of hogs for local markets, but most pork consumed in Canada today comes from factory farms. Canada produces far more pork than we can eat, so roughly half our production is exported.</p>
<p>NAFTA triggered the same restructuring process in Mexico when farmers there were forced to compete with cheap imports from the U.S. Some farms grew bigger and more industrialized, while many went out of business. Over time, there as here, the minimum size of a commercial hog barn grew. Mexico began to pursue an export pork agenda and companies such as Smithfield Food moved in to take advantage of the country's low wages -- reducing costs while centralizing production in fewer, larger facilities.</p>
<p>Without the backing of Canadian, American and Mexican policymakers and the trade agreements they signed, the environment in which this swine flu pandemic evolved would never have existed. The unnecessary deaths caused by this disease are one more cost of the export-oriented cheap food regime that has gripped North America and other parts of the world.</p>
<p>If Canadians are serious about preventing the next, perhaps more deadly pandemic, we must adopt food policies that respect the health of workers, the integrity of animals, the skills and knowledge of small farmers and the meaning of food culture in our lives. We need to create an environment where a pandemic cannot take hold.</p>
<p>Livestock production must be moved out of factory farms, where crowded, stressful conditions for workers and animals create myriad opportunities for viruses and other pathogens to evolve into new and potentially dangerous diseases. Quantities produced by our agricultural sector should reflect domestic consumption levels.</p>
<p>Instead of competing in the cost-cutting race to the bottom of export markets, we should allow other countries to produce the pork they need and offer their farmers the opportunity to earn a decent livelihood.</p>
<p>A major portion of agriculture safety net payments in Canada are propping up the hog industry. It's better use of public funds to invest in an agriculture system that takes care of the land, people and animals and promotes health.</p>

<p>Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister Bob Bjornerud is encouraging residents to pack a few more ham sandwiches for lunch or throw a pork roast on the barbecue.</p>
<p>"I think it doesn't hurt to reassure the public that there's no link between influenza and hogs right now and that pork is safe to eat," said Bjornerud, as he did his part Wednesday to boost an industry that took a hit when the H1N1 influenza strain earned the name "swine flu."</p>
<p>Bjornerud visited with pork producers and industry representatives at the legislature and issued a press release reaffirming pork is safe.</p>
<p>"As happened when BSE hit the cattle industry, the (beef) consumption actually in Canada went up by consumers. I think that's what we're trying to do here today, reassure the public (pork) is safe and hopefully that they and go buy pork in all the stores," Bjornerud told reporters.</p>
<p>The flu strain, a mixture of swine, human and avian viruses, is now formally referred to by world health experts as the H1N1 flu. A dozen people in Saskatchewan are confirmed to have had mild bouts with the virus, according to health officials.</p>
<p>A swine herd in Alberta was found to have H1N1 flu last week. A worker had returned to the farm after being in Mexico, the epicentre of the outbreak. However, health experts have stressed eating properly prepared pork poses no flu risk to people.</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan government is not planning any further financial assistance for hog producers, noting money from an aid program announced earlier this year is still being dispersed.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Scientist faces smuggling charges; Man found with 22 vials used in Ebola research</b>
</div><div>Philip Ling   </div>
<div>National Post</div>

</p>
<p>A Canadian scientist was stopped at the U. S. border last week after authorities found 22 vials used in Ebola research from Canada's National Microbiology Lab in his possession, officials said yesterday.</p>
<p>The incident has sparked controversy and serious questions about security protocols at the Winnipeg lab that contains some of the world's most deadliest pathogens.</p>
<p>Konan Michel Yao, 42, was apprehended by U. S. officials as he attempted to enter the United States at the Pembina, N. D., border crossing from Manitoba on May 5.</p>
<p>Mr. Yao faces U. S. criminal charges for smuggling and is currently in the custody of the U. S. Marshals service.</p>
<p>Mr. Yao was carrying unidentified biological materials in vials wrapped in aluminum foil inside a glove, wrapped in a plastic bag in the trunk of his car, U. S. Customs and Border Patrol spokesman Mike Milne told the Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Plummer, scientific director general of the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, said the vials did not contain any infectious pathogens.</p>
<p>"At no time was the health of citizens of Canada or the U. S. at risk, as the seized materials are known to be non-infectious," he said.</p>
<p>FBI special agent E. K. Wilson said federal officials were initially called in to investigate whether the man smuggled the vials for bio-terrorism.</p>
<p>Documents allege the researcher said he knew he needed special clearance to transport the materials into the United States, but did not have a permit.</p>
<p>Mr. Plummer said Mr. Yao was working at the agency's special pathogens laboratory on an Ebola vaccine project when his research term ended in January.</p>
<p>"There was a small amount of genetic material from the Ebola virus in the material that he took off with, but it posed no risk of infection and no risk to the health of the public," he said.</p>
<p>"It's basically genetic material, some of which had an Ebola gene in it. It's just a gene. It's not infectious. The only thing he could've done with it was make an Ebola vaccine."</p>
<p>Mr. Yao never had access to Level 3 and 4 pathogens, such as the swine flu virus, HIV and Ebola virus, Mr. Plummer said. He had access to a Level 2 laboratory and "only worked with non-infectious materials."</p>
<p>Mr. Yao said in an affidavit obtained by Reuters that he took the vials with him when he left the lab at the end of his contract on Jan. 21, to help him get a head start on his research at his new job at a U. S. disease research lab.</p>
<p>Canada's public health agency did not know the vials were missing until it was contacted by the RCMP, which had been alerted by U. S. border services, Mr. Plummer said.</p>
<p>The agency does not search employees or former employees when they leave, Mr. Plummer said, adding that he "is satisfied" that no one else in the lab was aware of Mr. Yao's actions.</p>

<p>Eight more Quebecers have caught the H1N1 flu virus, raising the total to 25 in the province, public health authorities said yesterday.</p>
<p>Five individuals got sick after being in contact with family members or friends who had returned from Mexico with the swine flu virus.</p>
<p>Three other people, however, have fallen ill without having travelled to Mexico or having been in contact with someone who did. This suggests the virus is circulating, said Alain Poirier, Quebec's director of public health. All cases to date have been mild.</p>
<p>Six of the newly infected patients live in the Montreal region, while the two others are in Quebec City. All have been told to stay home until they no longer have symptoms.</p>
<p>Poirier said the flu will no longer be tracked on a case-by-case basis. Instead, authorities will follow trends in terms of the virus's geographical spread, its virulence and its genetic modifications.</p>
<p>One newly infected patient is a student at Purcell Academy in Pierrefonds. The school remains open, though all students and staff have been asked to follow protocols outlined by public health officials.</p>

<p>According to the Chinese calendar, 2009 is the year of the ox.</p>
<p>But North Americans might be mistaken for thinking it's actually the year of the pig, and not because of the H1N1 flu; the four-legged pink animal is a more appropriate mascot, given how many companies and sectors have wiggled up to governments to ask for aid in this year alone.</p>
<p>The list is almost endless, ranging from the brazen -- the U. S. porn industry when represented by Larry Flynt who was at least half-joking -- to the reckless -- major players in the U. S. financial sector -- to the predictable -- the automotive sector, which has sought taxpayer money in both good times and bad. As to the automotive industry, it's worth recalling the public dollars already sent to auto companies even before the financial meltdown. Their time at the public trough is not a recent phenomenon.</p>
<p>Between 2004 and 2008 alone, more than $750 million was sent to Canada's automotive sector from the federal and Ontario governments in the form of grants or "repayable" contributions.. Chrysler received $123 million; Toyota received $125 million; General Motors took home $200 million, while Ford garnered $280 million. Now in a recession, two of the Detroit three have asked for and received billions from both the U.S. and Canadian governments. Thus, Chrysler and General Motors serve as useful but expensive case studies in the folly of government intervention.</p>
<p>Dennis DesRosiers, an auto industry consultant who tracks the numbers, points out that automobile sales in March in Canada were down by 15 per cent from the same month in 2008. The March figures understate the magnitude of the decline. In the first quarter of 2009, automobile sales in Canada were down to 284,000 from 364,000 in the same quarter last year; that's almost a 22 per cent decline.</p>
<p>Which auto companies have suffered the most in sales declines in Canada and the U.S.? The former Big Three. Total North American automobile sales reached 20.3 million in 2000, declining to just over 16.1 million last year. Forecasts for 2009 are for 12.7 million unit sales with a slight recovery next year, hitting 19.6 million in 2013.</p>
<p>What's interesting is that the Detroit/Ontario Three are losing market share faster than the general decline. This is evident from looking at the share of union-produced vehicles.</p>
<p>Desrosiers' calculations reveal that in 1995, 79 per cent of all new vehicle sales came from a factory with either the United Auto Workers (the U. S. automotive union) present or the Canadian Autoworkers Union (CAW) on the factory floor.</p>

</div><div>By Bruce Owen   </div>
<div>616 words</div><div>13 May 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>A Winnipeg woman is Manitoba's second confirmed case of the H1N1 flu virus, health officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The woman, in her 50s and with a pre-existing medical condition, is being treated in hospital, Dr. Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief provincial public health officer, said.</p>
<p>She had not travelled to Mexico and there is no evidence she had been in contact with someone who had travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>Kettner said details about the woman, like her location and contacts she may have had, won't be released as there is nothing about her case that changes how people should manage their routines. "People shouldn't be afraid," he said, adding it's virtually impossible to eliminate exposure to the virus.</p>
<p>Kettner said the best defence against the virus is regular handwashing and maintaining good health.</p>
<p>Manitoba's first H1N1 flu case, reported more than a week ago, involved a young girl from Brandon. She did not require hospital care.</p>
<p>Health officials also said that, with the H1N1 flu virus present in Manitoba, more cases of H1N1 are expected to occur. Most are expected to be mild. Those with weakened immune systems and the very young or elderly are at risk of more severe illness.</p>
<p>Kettner said health officials are also watching to see if the virus finds its way into isolated First Nations communities where it could spread quickly. Many reserves have cramped living conditions and a high number of residents have chronic illnesses.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada said as of Tuesday a total of 358 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 flu have been reported in Canada.</p>
<p>As of Monday, half the cases involved people 22 or younger. The youngest is one and the oldest is 66. About half a dozen people have been hospitalized and one death has been reported.</p>
<p>Confirmation of the second swine flu case in the province comes as scientists at Winnipeg's microbiology lab scramble to develop a vaccine in time for the fall flu season.</p>
<p>Health officials in Mexico say the virus is sputtering out but disease experts say the pandemic scare is far from over. Influenza viruses can mutate rapidly and scientists have no idea whether the current strain will resurface or morph into a deadlier virus.</p>
<p>Meantime, the World Health Organization and leading influenza research groups are investigating unpublished claims that the new swine flu virus may have evolved in a lab, not in nature.</p>
<p>The agency was informed of the pending publication over the weekend by the author, a retired Australian plant virologist named Adrian Gibbs.</p>
<p>Gibbs, who studies the evolution of viruses, said the genes of the novel H1N1 look like they evolved at a faster rate than would have been expected if the virus had just emerged from pigs.</p>
<p>That raises the spectre of human error resulting in the accidental release of the virus, Gibbs suggested Tuesday.</p>

<p>Signs to watch</p>
<p>If you have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, aches and tiredness, you are most contagious for the first week and could spread the disease for up to approximately a week once your symptoms start to appear. You should:</p>
<p>Stay home from school or work and limit contact with others to reduce the chance of spreading the virus.</p>
<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth; cough or sneeze into your elbow or sleeve or use a tissue. Wash your hands frequently.</p>

</div><div>Carla   </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>615 words</div><div>13 May 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>(From Times Colonist, May 14, 2009) Stores in the Bay Centre in downtown Victoria are extending their hours until 9 p.m. on Wednesdays, instead of closing at 6 p.m., to serve cruise ship passengers. A story on page C1 yesterday gave an incorrect closing time.***** </p>
<p>Shops in the Bay Centre downtown are staying open extra-late on Wednesdays to serve passengers from two huge cruise ships.</p>
<p>Last week, pouring rain greeted passengers arriving on the biggest cruise ships ever to pull into Ogden Point.</p>
<p>While some souvenir shops and attractions were busy, other stores were virtually empty as umbrella-toting passengers trudged along Government Street.</p>
<p>The Bay Centre, with 90 stores, will stay open until 9 a.m. Wednesdays, instead of 6 p.m.</p>
<p>"With up to 6,114 tourists and crew members from these two cruise ships visiting the downtown core, we're confident the additional three hours on Wednesday evenings will make a difference for ship visitors, retailers and local shoppers," said Darlene Hollstein, Bay Centre general manager.</p>
<p>The Mariner of the Seas and the Carnival Splendor, each with capacity for more than 3,000 passengers, plus crew, have been rerouted to a Pacific Northwest cruise.</p>
<p>The ships had originally been scheduled to sail to ports in Mexico but were detoured because of swine-flu fears.</p>
<p>They will be visiting Victoria on Wednesdays at noon for several weeks. Today marks their second visit to Victoria.</p>
<p>Cloudy skies are in the forecast from Environment Canada, with a 60 per cent chance of rain beginning in the evening, and a high temperature of 13 C.</p>
<p>Some Bay Centre stores reported sales increases of 10 to 33 per cent last Wednesday, Hollstein said yesterday.</p>
<p>"It was a substantial day in that respect." However, local residents stayed away because of the rain.</p>
<p>Wet weather helped at least one retail segment. "Outerwear stores did quite well," she said.</p>
<p>The weather last week kept some passengers on the ships, and led many of those who disembarked to take bus tours, returning to the city core in the late afternoon, she said.</p>
<p>They told store staff they had planned to have dinner and then shop, but were disappointed to find stores closed.</p>
<p>The Bay Centre's late opening will be monitored for a few weeks to see if the number of shoppers is sufficient to justify the move, she said.</p>
<p>Restaurants and gift stores tend to do well when cruise ships are in town.</p>

<p>Pork producers battered by public concerns over swine flu served about 1,500 pork sandwiches Tuesday afternoon at the legislature.</p>
<p>"What this does is it shows not only Canadian customers, but world customers, we have confidence in our product and so should they," hog broker Bill Mullen said.</p>
<p>"We're a resilient bunch."</p>
<p>Some countries closed their doors to Alberta pork after the H1N1 flu virus was found in hogs at the west-central farm of Arnold Van Ginkel.</p>
<p>Alberta Pork organized the lunchtime rally. As hundreds of provincial government employees and politicians lined up Tuesday for free sandwiches, Premier Ed Stelmach offered his support to the industry.</p>
<p>"You do play a very, very vital role in the economy of the province."</p>
<p>Health officials have assured the public people can't get the flu from pork, but producers have still watched their prices decline.</p>
<p>Mullen, who works for West-ern Hog Exchange, said the de-cline in exports and revenues has an impact on an industry mostly run by families.</p>

<p>With the flu on just about everyone's mind these days, how does a company ensure that its employees stay healthy?</p>
<p>Burnaby-based hygiene services provider Sani-Service has released its own "Top 8 Swine Flu Protection Tips For B.C. Business Owners" that's focused on ensuring the sanitization of thousands of commercial facilities across the Lower Mainland including restrooms at restaurants, department stores and office buildings. The business has seen a 35-per-cent rise in demand for its products and services since the H1N1 flu virus was detected in Mexico last month.</p>
<p>At the top of its list? Simple cleanliness.</p>
<p>"You've got to promote frequent hand washing and you've got to tell your sick employees to stay home," Sani-Service's B.C. franchise owner Elliot Laskin said in an interview. "And you've got to apply germicide to contact surfaces.</p>
<p>"The number one complaint in a restaurant is cleanliness in the washroom. When customers see a dirty washroom, they think the kitchen's not clean and they don't go back."</p>
<p>B.C.'s Sani-Service (www.sani-service.com[http://www.sani-service.com]), a franchise of the U.S.-based company Swisher Hygiene, started operations with one employee in Metro Vancouver in 1995. In its first full year of business, the company had 200 clients.</p>
<p>Since then, it's expanded and now has 65 full-time employees and 3,000 clients, including <span class="companylink">Costco</span>, <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>, London Drugs, Lordco and Canadian Tire.</p>
<p>"We do commercial businesses, restaurants, anybody with washrooms in their facilities," said Laskin, who added that they've been flooded with calls since swine flu first hit.</p>
<p>"People are concerned. The education's getting better, but our phones are ringing a lot. It's good for business, but it's also a good chance to educate people.</p>
<p>"Right now, our sales are up over 30 per cent compared to what we had last year because of the swine virus."</p>
<p>Laskin said his company sanitizes restrooms on a weekly basis for clients and provides sanitizers, soaps, paper products, auto-flush toilets and sinks. "We provide them and rent them to the client. And we maintain them."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the swine flu strain that has sickened people in 30 countries is more contagious than regular seasonal flu, the World Health Organization said Monday.</p>
<p>In seasonal flu, each person who comes in contact with someone who's sick has a five- per-cent to 15-per-cent probability of illness, according to the WHO's website. With swine flu, the probability increases to between 22 per cent to 33 per cent, WHO said.</p>
<p>Dr. Bonnie Henry of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control recently told employers in a packed ballroom that the swine flu is a matter of concern for everyone in the province.</p>
<p>She repeated the importance of encouraging people to stay at home if they are exhibiting flu symptoms, saying today's society has a "presenteeism problem" that translates into sick people feeling obliged to go into the office.</p>
<p>"The other really, really important thing is handwashing. It's very, very simple.</p>
<p>"Wash your hands at least five times a day and you greatly reduce your chances of transmission," she said.</p>
<p>bmorton@vancouversun.com</p>
<p>SANI-SERVICE'S TOP 8 SWINE FLU PROTECTION TIPS FOR B.C. BUSINESS OWNERS</p>
<p>- Promote frequent hand-washing: Business owners are urged to remind their employees to wash their hands frequently using soap and warm water, especially after coughing or sneezing.</p>
<p>- Encourage hygienic behavior in the workplace: Employees should be instructed to cover up when coughing or sneezing to avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth, and to use single-use tissues for wiping their noses. Office garbage bins should be emptied daily. Employees should be discouraged from sharing cups, dishes or cutlery.</p>
<p>- Ask sick employees to stay home: Employees should be encouraged to stay home if experiencing cold or flu symptoms. Discourage sick employees from "toughing it out" at work. It can prevent an entire workforce from falling ill.</p>
<p>- Make hand sanitizer available: Since workers aren't always near a sink to wash their hands, making hand sanitizers available, whether in a wall-mounted unit or in pocket-size bottles, can significantly help reduce the spread of germs.</p>
<p>- Apply germicide to contact surfaces: Properly treating contact surfaces like desktops, countertops and keyboards with germicide can prevent germs from contaminating surfaces across a facility.</p>
<p>- Keep restroom touch points clean: In-house and janitorial services often fail to provide a complete cleaning and sanitation on touch points such as bathroom door handles, flushing levers and towel dispensers. The use of a hospital-grade germicide on such areas can minimize the presence of pathogens on key touch points.</p>
<p>- Consider a Sanitizing Power Wash: A sanitizing power wash may help reduce cross-contamination in restrooms, kitchens and shower areas. By addressing virtually all surface areas -- including floors, walls, partitions, vents, ceilings, knobs and latches -- frequently overlooked areas can be properly sanitized.</p>
<p>- Let customers know what is being done to protect them: Informing customers of the value being placed on proper hygiene and the steps being taken to protect them, can go a long way towards reassuring them about a business's concern for health.</p>

<p>I'm tired of the World Health Organization and other health authorities being blamed for the panic over swine flu.</p>
<p>They never advised travel restrictions, they never advised bans on eating pork, they never said swine flu was a killer.</p>
<p>What they did say was that it was an unknown flu variant and that emergency action needed to be taken to find out if it was dangerous or not.</p>
<p>Let's be clear: The emergency was not that this flu was known to be deadly, but that it was an unknown. Finding out how dangerous it was, before it spread too widely, was critical. It would be irresponsible to determine the deadliness of a disease by waiting to see how many people it kills.</p>
<p>It was the media who chose to report as if the flu would kill millions. It was the media who decided that every single new case should be front page news. Three people with the flu in Ohio is not news.</p>
<p>The media could have done a better job of informing people. They could have said what a "pandemic" actually is. They could have explained why WHO took the actions it did.</p>
<p>Of course, governments didn't help either. I can't comprehend why the head of U.S. homeland security announced a health emergency. Other countries banned pork imports. Of course, once the public starts to panic, governments feel obliged to react.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the vast majority of these cases will be nothing, but we can't afford to be wrong. We can't have a health authorities second-guessing their medical decisions because the media insists on playing Chicken Little.</p>

<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says destroying Alberta hogs stricken with swine flu is not likely in the cards, but it will take at least three to four weeks to decide what to do with the herd on a farm near Rocky Mountain House.</p>
<p>"We're doing what we're doing primarily based on the need to have a better understanding of the public health significance of this and to clearly understand whatever animal health issues there might be around it as well," said Dr. Jim Clark, a veterinarian and national manager of the CFIA's disease control centre.</p>
<p>"What we know right now is it would appear this influenza A virus doesn't appear to be significantly different than any other influenza A virus in the swine population, but we have to wait for the research to be done on that."</p>
<p>Hog farmer Arnold Van Ginkel reiterated his argument at a meeting with the CFIA Tuesday that the agency should dispose of his 2,200 pigs because it would be in the best interests of his family and the pork industry, even though the animals are safe to eat.</p>
<p>His lawyer, Keith Wilson, said Van Ginkel argued he won't be able to sell the herd because of the stigma attached to it. He said that if the agency doesn't want to cull the herd, Van Ginkel would like it to take the hogs off his hands for research, provided he receives adequate compensation to start over again.</p>
<p>Van Ginkel, who came to Canada from Holland six years ago, expressed frustration Monday that no one will make a decision and the fate of his farm hangs in the balance.</p>
<p>Wilson said his client, CFIA officials and Alberta Agriculture officials agreed to meet again next week to try and find a solution. Van Ginkel is worried about the delay. "I think he was pleased about the meeting, but very anxious about the future for him and his family and the industry."</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach said the province is working with other provincial governments and Ottawa to develop a plan for dealing with the situation.</p>

<p>A student at Grant MacEwan College's downtown campus has been diagnosed with the H1N1 flu virus, prompting school officials to e-mail all staff and students about the case.</p>
<p>"MacEwan continues to remind students, faculty and staff to follow recommended procedures such as handwashing, covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing, checking with your doctor if you have any flu-like symptoms and staying at home if you are ill," the e-mail said.</p>
<p>The school has added sanitizers to various locations at all four campuses and is disinfecting surfaces more frequently.</p>
<p>Global News reported the case is one of those previously announced.</p>
<p>The bulk of the college's classes are done until fall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alberta reported one new case of the H1N1 virus as of Tuesday morning, that of a central Alberta girl whose travel history has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>She joins 52 other Albertans who have been sick from the flu, most with mild illness. But one woman from the Gift Lake Métis Settlement died after contracting the virus, although investigators don't yet know if the flu caused her death.</p>

</div><div>Peter A. Victor   </div>
<div>Citizen Special</div>
<div>1292 words</div><div>13 May 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>There's nothing like a good crisis to make us rethink old ideas. The Depression of the 1930s led</p>
<p>to the rejection of the prevailing idea that unemployment would right itself if only people would work for lower wages. Governments could do very little to help.</p>
<p>These ideas were overthrown by experience and by the invention of modern macro economics by British economist, John Maynard Keynes. By the end of the Second World War, most western governments had adopted Keynesian economic policies designed to ensure that total expenditures were sufficient to maintain full employment.</p>
<p>Keynesian economists soon discovered that full employment today meant a bigger economy tomorrow because some of the investment expenditures required to keep unemployment down -- on infrastructure, buildings and equipment -- also expanded the productive capacity of the economy. So does an expanding population and labour force. Initially, governments pursued economic growth to meet the more pressing concern of maintaining full employment, but this soon changed. In the 1950s, economic growth became the No. 1 economic policy objective of governments and all others, such as productivity, innovation, free trade, competitiveness, immigration, even education, became a means to that end.</p>
<p>Until a year or so ago all seemed to be going reasonably well. Then came the breakdown in the financial sector followed quickly by a recession that, through globalization, spread farther and faster than swine flu. Now governments are congratulating themselves for acting together to stimulate spending to get their economies back on course, much as Keynes might have recommended.</p>
<p>But times have changed since his day. World population has increased almost three times, world economic output has increased 10 times and with this massive expansion of the human presence on earth, we are confronting limits to the availability of cheap energy, to fresh water, and to the capacity of the atmosphere to absorb increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. At the same time we are destroying the habitat of numerous species of flora and fauna and the security of our own food supplies is threatened.</p>
<p>It is time to rethink the old idea that the solution to all our problems lies in the incessant expansion of the economy. Rich countries like Canada should explore alternatives, especially if poorer countries are to benefit from economic growth for a while in a world increasingly constrained by biophysical limits.</p>
<p>Some deny or simply ignore these limits and argue that economic growth in rich countries is necessary to stimulate growth in poorer ones. Others say that with "green" growth we can expand economic output as we reduce the demands we place on nature through more efficient production, better designed products, fewer goods and more services, compact urban forms, and organic agriculture.</p>
<p>While these measures may well help in a transition they are an unlikely prescription for the long term. What is required is a radical rethinking of our economies and their relation to the natural world.</p>
<p>Although no 21st-century Keynes has emerged to prepare the intellectual ground for such a change in thinking, we do have a body of knowledge built up over many decades and now thriving under the name of "ecological economics."</p>
<p>Ecological economists understand economies to be subsystems of the earth ecosystem, sustained by a flow of materials and energy from and back to the larger system in which they are embedded. It is understandable that when these flows were small relative to the earth they could be ignored, as they have been in much of mainstream economics. Economists are not alone in treating the economy as a self-contained, free standing system largely independent of its environmental setting. It is a widely held view that environmental protection is just one among multiple competing interests to be traded off against the economy.</p>
<p>And anyway, this mainstream perspective teaches that if resource and environmental constraints are encountered, scarcities will be signalled by increases in prices that will induce a variety of beneficial changes in behaviour and technology. Should this system of scarcity-price-response fail then economists can estimate "shadow" prices which can be imposed directly through taxes or used indirectly through policies based on cost-benefit analysis to fix the problem.</p>
<p>To ecological economists, this is an inadequate response to the myriad problems of resource depletion, environmental contamination and habitat destruction confronting humanity in the 21st century. They question the pursuit of endless economic growth and contemplate a very different kind of future.</p>
<p>In my own work, I have examined whether and under what conditions a country like Canada could have full employment, no poverty, much reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and maintain fiscal balance, without relying on economic growth. Using a comparatively simple model of the Canadian economy I have explored scenarios in which these objectives are met. The ingredients for success include a shorter work year to reduce unemployment yet retain the advantages of technological progress, a carbon price to discourage greenhouse gas emissions, and more generous anti-poverty programs.</p>
<p>In such an economy, success would not be judged by the rate of economic growth but by more meaningful measures of personal and community well-being. We would adjust to strict limits on our use of materials, energy, land and waste, guided by prices that provide more accurate information about real rather than contrived scarcities. We would enjoy more services and fewer but more durable and repairable products, and we would value use over status when deciding what to buy.</p>
<p>Rampant consumerism would be history, advertising would be more informative and less persuasive, and new technologies would be better screened to avoid problems to be fixed later, if at all. Infrastructure, buildings and equipment would be more efficient in their use of energy and we would think and act more locally and less globally. With more free time at our disposal we would educate ourselves and our children for life not just work.</p>
<p>Is all this simply wishful thinking of a sort that flourishes in troubled times? I think not. The undercurrent of discontent with modern life is rich with ideas for a better future, one that is not dependent on economic growth.</p>
<p>For example, in March of this year the U.K.'s Sustainable Development Commission delivered its report "Prosperity Without Growth?" to the British government endorsing and amplifying many of the ideas expressed here. The Centre for the Advancement of a Steady State Economy based in the United States has obtained more than 3,000 signatures on its position statement designed to help change the goal of the economy from growth to sustainability.</p>
<p>At the local level, Transition Towns have spread in less than four years from Britain to many countries including Canada, to raise awareness of sustainable living and to build local resilience in response to the combined threats of peak oil and climate change. Even mainstream economists are moving with the tide.</p>
<p>Nobel Laureate economist Robert Solow said last year: "It is possible that the U.S. and Europe will find that ... either continued growth will be too destructive to the environment and they are too dependent on scarce natural resources, or that they would rather use increasing productivity in the form of leisure." Let's add Canada to the list and go from there.</p>

<p>The two drugs used to treat influenza should be used carefully and only when needed for the chronically ill, pregnant women and other vulnerable patients, global health officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The new H1N1 flu appears to be a little more contagious and a little more severe than seasonal influenza, but only patients who need them the most should get the drugs, in part to keep the drugs working well in case the swine flu becomes more dangerous, said Dr. Nikki Shindo of the World Health Organization. "We will recommend to consider the use of antivirals for high-risk groups or the group of people at increased risk, depending on the availability," Shindo said. The new virus has been confirmed in 5,251 patients in 30 countries, WHO said. Canada confirmed an additional 28 cases Tuesday, bringing the total to 358, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. The United States has the most, with 3,009 confirmed cases in 45 states and three deaths. Mexico has 58 confirmed deaths and Canada and Costa Rica have each confirmed one death from the infection.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Three more cases of the H1N1 flu virus were confirmed in Ontario yesterday, but the Guelph count remains at just one case.</p>
<p>"We seem to be over the fast and furious," said Jan Craig, manager of communications for Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health. "We have no new cases to report in our area."</p>
<p>There was another new case reported yesterday in Waterloo Region, bringing its caseload to two. In Ontario, there are now 113 cases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the World Health Organization and leading influenza research groups are investigating unpublished claims that the new H1N1 swine flu virus may have evolved in a laboratory, not in nature.</p>
<p>The Geneva-based agency was informed of the pending publication over the weekend by the author, a retired Australian virologist named Adrian Gibbs.</p>
<p>It scrambled to draw in researchers from leading human and animal influenza laboratories around the world in a bid to determine if the claim has merit -- and if it does, whether that changes the advice WHO gives member countries on the threat posed by the new H1N1 swine flu virus.</p>
<p>The WHO's leading flu scientist said the consultation is still ongoing and a conclusion hasn't been reached, but the weight of evidence so far suggests the theory isn't correct.</p>
<p>"I think the preliminary analysis certainly suggest there are other explanations and that the explanation suggested by the author is not the best one," Dr. Keiji Fukuda, acting assistant director general for health security and environment, said in an interview from Geneva.</p>
<p>Fukuda said at least one WHO collaborating centre for influenza, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, has done an extensive analysis of available genetic sequence data for swine influenza viruses. That work does not support the claim made by Gibbs, he said.</p>
<p>Researchers at Cambridge University who specialize in the evolution of influenza viruses also challenge the hypothesis, Fukuda said. "They also feel that there are alternate explanations for this."</p>
<p>Bloomberg News reported yesterday that Gibbs plans to publish online a scientific report saying the never-before-seen virus may have evolved in eggs.</p>
<p>Eggs are used in laboratories and in vaccine manufacturing to grow up quantities of influenza viruses.</p>
<p>If the virus had spent time evolving in eggs, it would suggest it was not solely the creation of nature but may have been accidentally or deliberately engineered in a lab.</p>
<p>If that were the case, it would of course raise questions about how something constructed in a lab ended up circulating in humans in at least 30 countries around the globe.</p>
<p>"If there was evidence that it was an egg-derived isolate, then that means it's been handled in a laboratory. And if it's been handled in a laboratory, then there are different possibilities that you have to think of," Fukuda said.</p>
<p>"Was this developed in part as a vaccine virus? Was this developed as some sort of research project? And in those instances, was it released on purpose? Was it an accidental release? What would be the circumstances?"</p>
<p>Gibbs apparently claims that the virus bears the hallmarks of having undergone "accelerated evolution" such as what happens when flu viruses try to adapt to growth in eggs.</p>
<p>Italian influenza researcher Dr. Ilaria Capua said there is too little known about swine influenza virus evolution to make the claim.</p>

<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>A student who has completely recovered is Waterloo Region's second confirmed case of the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The case is one of a total of 113 that have been confirmed in Ontario -- three new cases, including the local one, were announced yesterday. All but two of the province's cases have been mild, including the ones in Waterloo Region. Two individuals did require hospital care elsewhere, but have since gone home. The region's first case was announced Monday. That person, a young adult, has also recovered. There's no link between the two local cases. Personal information, including age, gender and city of residence, is not being released by health officials.</p>
<p>However, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, the region's associate medical officer of health, described the second flu victim as "an older adolescent" who had a mild illness that did not require hospitalization.</p>
<p>"There are no special measures being asked of the schools," Wang said. The student remained at home until completely recovered. Wang added local schools have not reported greater than normal absentee rates.</p>
<p>The student fell ill about a week ago, but got better fairly quickly. The person had recently travelled to the southern United States, where many cases of the H1N1 flu have surfaced.</p>

<p>She sneezed.</p>
<p>All manner of grossness formed in tiny little droplets that flew from her nose, landing all over my face. Not one or two droplets, either. A virtual downpour of liquid snot.</p>
<p>For real.</p>
<p>And then, just as I finished wiping from my cheeks and forehead the many, many diseases I imagined lived inside every one of those droplets, she did it again.</p>
<p>Come. On.</p>
<p>I definitely just got the swine flu, I thought. If I'm lucky, I'll have the swine flu. Who knows what kind of weird diseases live in dogs, especially canines who've been passed from one shelter to another? I mean, the SPCA is a wonderful place and all, but that's a whole lot of doggies living in pretty close contact to one another.</p>
<p>She had now flipped onto her back, paws in the air, begging for a tummy rub. I looked down at her.</p>
<p>Dog, first you give me the swine flu and now you want to be rewarded?</p>
<p>She just smiled, tongue hanging out, and tapped me on the arm with her paw. My dog hit the jackpot in pushovers.</p>
<p>Still, it got me thinking, as germs often do, about all the many many illnesses she just snotted all over me. It's a fun little game I play -- the Hypochondria Sweepstakes. It seems to me that in the grand scheme of illnesses, swine flu wouldn't be so bad. There are worse things, right? I mean, the name sucks. That's probably the worst thing about swine flu. Well, that, and the fact that it killed a bunch of people. But for the most-part it's fairly treatable, only a handful of people actually have it around here and if you do get it, you kind of become an instant celebrity.</p>
<p>Seems to me, the worst part about swine flu is that you would always be linked with swine. Not some cute, pink little piglet, not a fluffy kitten, not even a shnotty puppy. Swine. Big, old, dirty dirty pigs rolling around in their own crap, swine.</p>
<p>But whatever. Until this whole swine flu thing came up, it had been a fairly quiet news season and nothing gets people more excited than a possible pandemic. I'm not certain why, mind you. Not when the whole freaking world seems to be suffering from the same cold and/or stomach virus. Oh yeah, and then there's that pesky cancer thing. Do any of those count as pandemics?</p>
<p>So I was sitting here contemplating the many possible diseases I might have acquired, when my neighbour who lives in the condo beneath mine lit up a smoke. I know this because in order to keep his own condo free from the foul stench of cigarettes, as well as avoid afflicting his loved ones with his second-hand smoke, he opens his screen door, hangs out and over the railing with his arm way up. That way, the offending trail of smoke is as far away as possible from his own home and flows directly into my screen door, completely saturating my home with the smell.</p>
<p>He smokes a lot. We both work from home. One entire wall of our condos is windows which means that it gets hot in here, winter or summer. During the summer months, I can turn on the air conditioning, but not yet. It won't get switched on for another month.</p>
<p>Which means that I can either roast in a stifling condo or I can open the screen door and inhale his cigarette. Once, in the fall, I asked him, as a neighbourly gesture, to please not hold his cigarette up to my unit. I didn't ask him not to smoke. I didn't ask him to shut his screen door. It was basically the equivalent of saying, "please don't blow your smoke in my face."</p>
<p>He feels he has that right. To blow smoke in my face. It's his home and he can do whatever he likes in it. He told me this yesterday when I asked him again. If he had the music turned way up and I had asked him to turn it down, he would've had to comply if it were after 9 p.m. because there are city bylaws against noise pollution. We have condo rules against making too much noise, disrupting another owner's enjoyment of their home.</p>
<p>But nothing for smoking. No bylaws, no rules. Too much noise, yes. Cancer, no.</p>
<p>And smokers, well, they're pretty defensive about their smoking. Music would be one thing, smoking quite another. He doesn't want to have to go downstairs every time he wants a cigarette, he told me. And certainly he won't smoke in his own home. That would be gross. And he doesn't care about mine.</p>
<p>So I officially have no rights here. Tell me why, again? Oh, but the city has implemented a plan for swine flu, right?</p>

<p>Hamilton and Halton health officials have reported no new cases of swine flu since Monday, but say people should not assume the virus spread is slowing.</p>
<p>"It's just the one day," warned Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton Region's medical officer of health. "You need to look at two or three days in a row to make any conclusions."</p>
<p>Ontario had only three new cases yesterday.</p>
<p>Halton's health department is still awaiting the results of a number of tests on swabs taken from people who had the onset of flu symptoms last week, Nosal said.</p>
<p>"I'm hopeful with the warmer weather coming, that within the next week or two, we should see a dramatic drop."</p>
<p>Hamilton medical officer of health Dr. Elizabeth Richardson said flu viruses usually don't spread much in warmer weather but researchers are still finding out what the H1N1 swine flu virus means for people.</p>
<p>"It's really too early to tell," she said.</p>
<p>Most of Halton's 11 confirmed cases are students in Oakville. Five cases are from Lorne Skuce public elementary and two are from T.A. Blakelock high school. The Catholic board has one case at St. Luke's elementary and one in Georgetown at Christ the King high school in north Halton.</p>
<p>All cases have been mild, according to public health officials. None have recently travelled abroad.</p>
<p>Halton's public school board brought in extra cleaning staff to wipe surfaces at Blakelock on the weekend, said board spokesperson Marnie Denton. It did the same at Lorne Skuce after the first case last week, she said.</p>
<p>Blakelock is one of three Oakville high schools that hosted 30 Japanese students and six teachers who are now quarantined in Japan since their return last Thursday. Reports from Japan say four have confirmed cases of H1N1 swine flu -- and are Japan's first cases.</p>
<p>The group is from Neyagawa, Oakville's twin city in Japan. Members stayed with host families and were in Canada from April 24 until Thursday. They also travelled to several cities, including Ottawa and Niagara Falls, Denton said.</p>

<p>French soccer will hold its traditional season curtain-raiser in Montreal next summer, marking the first time the game has been played outside of France.</p>
<p>"It's time for French football to conquer new markets," Frederic Thiriez, president of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), said on the league website.</p>
<p>"As we've managed to double the revenue for our TV rights in foreign countries in a year, the idea of playing the Champions Trophy abroad was obvious.</p>
<p>"Montreal is the ideal entrance into North America.</p>
<p>"We're happy to be able to share this initial experiment with our Canadian friends."</p>
<p>Second division Guingamp, which won the French Cup by beating Rennes last weekend, will play the league champion in Montreal on July 26, 2010.</p>
<p>No details have been finalized at this point as to where the game will be played.</p>

<p>The swine-flu scare has sent customer demand soaring for a Burnaby-based team of germ-busters and virus vanquishers.</p>
<p>Sani-Service B.C. has seen a 35-per-cent jump in overall requests for products and services since the end of last month after the H1N1 struck, company general manager Becki Hubley said yesterday.</p>
<p>"In the past, for our germicidal service alone, we might have added five to six new customers a day," Hubley said. "We're now at about 10 new customers."</p>
<p>Sani-Service, which employs 65 people, has hired three new route technicians in the last few weeks to keep up with demand, Hubley said.</p>
<p>At the heart of Sani-Service's offerings is a weekly hygiene service that sees technicians whup pathogens by disinfecting and applying germicide in companies' bathrooms.</p>
<p>The germicide, which protects for at least seven days, is effective against the H1N1 strain and other bugs and viruses, Hubley said.</p>
<p>Interest has also risen for products such as touch-free faucets, towel dispensers and automatic flush units, she said.</p>
<p>Heightened public awareness of hygiene in the wake of swine flu means demand should not slow significantly once the H1N1 crisis is past, Hubley said</p>
<p>Restaurants are Sani-Service's largest single sectoral customer, accounting for about a third of its corporate clients.</p>
<p>"Most restaurants, at least the nicer ones, know that their customers think the state of the washroom is reflective of the state of the kitchen, so hygiene is important to them," Hubley said.</p>
<p>Sani-Service B.C., which serves businesses across the Lower Mainland, is the largest franchise of North Carolina-based Swisher Hygiene, she said.</p>

</p>
<p>GENEVA -- The World Health Organization is investigating an Australian researcher's claim that the H1N1 flu virus circling the globe may have been created as a result of human error.</p>
<p>Adrian Gibbs, 75, who collaborated on research that led to the development of the Tamiflu drug, said yesterday that he intends to publish a report suggesting the new strain may have accidentally evolved in eggs that scientists use to grow viruses and drugmakers use to make vaccines.</p>
<p>Gibbs said he came to his conclusion as part of an effort to trace the virus's origins by analyzing its genetic blueprint.</p>
<p>The WHO received the study last weekend and is reviewing it, said Keiji Fukuda, the agency's assistant director-general of health security and environment.</p>
<p>Gibbs, who has studied germ evolution for 40 years, is one of the first scientists to analyze the genetic makeup of the virus that was identified three weeks ago in Mexico and threatens to touch off the first flu pandemic since 1968.</p>
<p>A virus that resulted from lab experimentation or vaccine production may indicate a greater need for security, Fukuda said.</p>
<p>"The sooner we get to grips with where it has come from, the safer things might become," Gibbs said in a telephone interview from Canberra. "It could be a mistake" that occurred at a vaccine-production facility or the virus could have jumped from a pig to another mammal or a bird before reaching humans, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the global number of flu cases yesterday soared to 5,251, world health authorities said as the virus spread to three more countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America.</p>
<p>The worst-affected country outside the Americas, Spain, also reported two new confirmed cases, taking its total to 100.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's health chief argued that quarantine was no longer workable.</p>
<p>"As local transmission becomes sustained and significant, isolation and quarantine is no longer appropriate or practicable," said York Chow.</p>
<p>The highest number of cases are in the U.S. with more than 3,002, including three deaths. Mexico was second with 2,059 cases, including 58 deaths.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight new cases were confirmed across Canada yesterday, bringing the total to 358.</p>
<p>The new cases mean the virus is present in nine provinces and one territory.</p>
<p>There has only been one death that has been possibly linked to the flu.</p>
<p>Quebec reported the highest number of new cases, with nine. Nova Scotia had seven, B.C. had four, Ontario had three, Saskatchewan had two and Alberta, Manitoba and Yukon each reported one case.</p>

</p>
<p>Twenty-eight new cases of swine flu were confirmed across the country Tuesday, bringing the national total of cases to 358, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>The new cases mean the virus is present in nine provinces and one territory.</p>
<p>There has only been one death that has been possibly linked to the influenza strain after an Alberta woman, who died last month, tested positive for a mild form of the disease.</p>
<p>Tina L'Hirondella, 39, from the northern Alberta Metis settlement of Gift Lake died April 28.</p>
<p>Officials with Alberta Health and Wellness said she had originally checked herself into hospital in High Prairie, Alta., with asthma problems.</p>
<p>Quebec reported the highest number of new cases Tuesday, with nine; Nova Scotia had seven, British Columbia had four, Ontario had three, Saskatchewan had two and Alberta, Manitoba and Yukon each reporting one case.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization urged people to remain on alert Tuesday because the H1N1 virus could possibly mutate into a more virulent form and spark an influenza pandemic that could be expected to circle the globe up to three times.</p>
<p>The impact of a pandemic would vary, as a virus that causes only mild illness in countries with strong health systems can become "devastating" in those with weak health systems, shortages of drugs and poorly equipped hospitals, the United Nations agency said.</p>
<p>The agency's pandemic alert level remained at 5 Tuesday, its second-highest level on a scale of 1 to 6. This means that the virus shows no signs of sustained person-to-person spread outside North America.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the organization said 5,251 people have been infected in 30 countries, which includes 61 deaths. Hardest hit were Mexico with 2,059 cases, including 56 deaths, and the United States with 2,600 cases including three deaths.</p>
<p>On Monday, Toronto's University Health Network said four of its employees had tested positive for the H1N1 flu virus, including one who has had contact with patients.</p>

<p>The number of swine flu cases in Saskatchewan has risen by two.</p>
<p>According to the Saskatchewan Health website, one new case has been confirmed in the Prince Albert Parkland Health Region, and another in the <span class="companylink">Heartland Health</span> Region.</p>
<p>This brings the total number of cases confirmed in Saskatchewan to 12. No more information about the latest cases is immediately available.</p>
<p>The new cases come a day after the Ministry of Health reported six more mild cases -- in two males and four females -- all of which are in the Saskatoon Health Region.</p>
<p>According to the health region, none of those six cases were among people who had been to Mexico. "The virus is definitely present in our community and is being transmitted within our local context," said Dr. Johnmark Opondo, deputy medical health officer.</p>
<p>There has been one middle-aged person affected. The rest were teenagers or young adults.</p>
<p>A Saskatoon high school student who vacationed in Mexico with her family was one of the first two people in Saskatchewan to test positive for swine flu. She has recovered from mild symptoms and did not require hospitalization. Health region officials met with parents and students at St. Joseph High School to answer questions Monday.</p>
<p>Two cases were also confirmed on the weekend in the Prince Albert Parkland and Heartland health regions.</p>
<p>From now on, the Saskatoon Health Region will not let school boards know if they have students with the virus unless there is a "cluster" of two or more cases in one place, Opondo said. So far, the cases have been "scattered," he said.</p>
<p>The way the virus is behaving is very similar to seasonal influenza, said Opondo. People are encouraged to practise frequent hand-washing and proper cough etiquette, and to isolate themselves if they experience symptoms.</p>
<p>The number of swine flu cases across the nation rose to 358 by Tuesday. Toronto's University Health Network (UHN) said four of its employees have now tested positive for the H1N1 flu virus, including one who has had contact with patients. UHN would not reveal which of the network's three hospitals the individuals work at due to privacy reasons, said spokesperson Gillian Howard.</p>

<p>In a letter sent to the École Dollard des Ormeaux school community on Friday, the Commission scolaire Marguerite Bourgeoys said people should continue with their regular activities if they aren't experiencing any symptoms.</p>
<p>But it recommended that students and staff with flu-like symptoms should stay at home.</p>
<p>The boy caught the flu in Canada and was recovering at home, the school board said. Board spokesperson Brigitte Léonard said she did not know the boy's age or his grade level.</p>
<p>Janitors undertook a big clean-up of the school over the weekend, Léonard said. "Everything was cleaned, down to the doorknobs and toys."</p>
<p>Health officials went to the school yesterday to field questions. In all, 103 out of 503 students were absent, the school board said.</p>
<p>Quebec's Education Department sent a bulletin to school boards, CEGEPs and universities last week about the H1N1 virus. It noted that provincial public health officials recommend students and staff with flu-like symptoms not go to school for up to seven days after the onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>Last week, Collège Charlemagne in Pierrefonds said three students had the flu.</p>
<p>A fourth case of H1N1 was confirmed at the private school yesterday, bringing the total number of infections in Quebec to 17.</p>
<p>Dr. Alain Poirier, Quebec's national director of public health, said yesterday the virus, which appears to be of "low severity," now is "all over the place."</p>
<p>Poirier said as the weather gets warmer, the normal flu season is ending, but he cautioned that the new flu virus could still mutate and return in the fall, so public health officials must remain vigilant.</p>
<p>Poirier said basic precautions, such as hand washing and protecting oneself from those who are infected, are ways to deal with the disease.</p>
<p>"This is not rocket science," he said.</p>
<p>People with flu symptoms should stay home from school or work, he added.</p>
<p>The new case is an employee of Collège Charlemagne who was suspected of having the disease last Friday.</p>

<p>Britain's financial markets regulator said "business as usual" will continue even though one of its employees is being tested for H1N1 flu and another 10 employees are being quarantined for a week.</p>
<p>"We have contingency plans in place and the FSA is able to fully function,"Kirsty Clay, a spokeswoman for the Financial Services Authority in London, said Monday. "It's business as usual."</p>
<p>The FSA said that a staff member was being tested for swine flu, or H1N1, after returning from the U. S. on May 5. Other employees that came into contact with him have also been sent home for seven days, Clay said.The FSA is also asking staff who have returned from the U. S. and Mexico to stay at home for a similar period, she said.</p>
<p>Swine flu has sickened at least 4,379 people in 29 countries, including 49 who died, according to figures from the World Health Organization. The U. K. has 47 confirmed cases, according to the WHO.</p>
<p>It's unclear when the test results of the employee will come back. While Clay declined to comment on whether the staff member had any contact with financial companies that are regulated by the FSA on May 5, she said that the FSA had contacted anyone who needed to take extra precautions.</p>
<p>The FSA said May 1 it would contact the most important financial services companies in the U. K. to ensure they have emergency plans in place.</p>

</p>
<p>- Will the eternal struggle between dogs and vacuum cleaners ever be resolved peacefully?</p>
<p>- I'm glad the city is cracking down on jaywalkers. This has clearly been identified as the No. 1 concern for Edmontonians.</p>
<p>- If you don't want to pay $18 to park downtown, take public transit. That's what they do in Toronto, Vancouver, Rome and Paris. Threatening to boycott downtown puts redevelopment at risk.</p>
<p>- My last leisure trip downtown was in 1985 when two prominent 101st Street merchants I had previously patronized each refused to make change for my bus fare unless I made an on-the-spot purchase.</p>
<p>- I used to report potholes to the city. Now I depend on the holes in our road to slow down the speeders.</p>
<p>- Edmonton's downtown Greyhound terminal is an embarrassment. It is rundown, full of street people and smells like an overflowing toilet. I was nervous about leaving a family member there to catch a bus to Calgary.</p>
<p>- We may as well leave all that sand on the sidewalks. Before we know it, the city will be sanding them again for next winter.</p>
<p>- If you want to carry a knife in public, bring your wood carving with you.</p>
<p>- There's a sign on Rice Howard Way that reads the city has designated it as a pilot area for keeping the city free of litter. Apparently, the pilot hasn't been to the airport yet.</p>
<p>- A quick poll: All you readers who have used the City Centre Airport over the last three years raise your hand. That's what I thought.</p>
<p>- If the City Centre Airport is closed, move the Edmonton Indy to the QEII Highway. There is already plenty of racing there.</p>
<p>- The City Centre Airport and the trolley buses have a lot in common: both were discredited through abuse and neglect.</p>
<p>- Why do people think trolley buses are non-polluting? Have they never driven past the huge coal-fired power generating stations that strip the land bare and warm the waters?</p>
<p>- Let's call Epcor's electrical power spinoff Epron.</p>
<p>- Hey, did you see the photo of the Swiss hikers in the Alps in the new Travel Alberta magazine this weekend?</p>
<p>- How could George Orwell write his seminal literary masterpiece 1984 in 1949, when Stelmach's Conservatives did not introduce bills 44 or 46 until 2009?</p>
<p>- I respect your belief that God made you the way you are. But please, let our children learn the facts, not beliefs.</p>
<p>- Of course we Albertans don't believe in evolution. In 1971, God created the Alberta Progressive Conservative party in all its pristine perfection. Denying its divine right will set off thunderbolts all over the place.</p>
<p>- If parents want a say in all teaching, can teachers have a say in parenting?</p>
<p>- Looks like that evolution thing missed a few too many Albertans.</p>
<p>- The price for attending an average high school grad at the Shaw Conference Centre these days is about $200 a pair. That's insane.</p>
<p>- A no-zero policy for our students? Why bother sending them to school in the first place? Think of the cost savings.</p>
<p>- If magpies bother you, stop feeding them. Secure your garbage, bring in pet food dishes from the yard and make sure your birdhouses have entry holes smaller than the head of a magpie. When there is no food, they leave.</p>
<p>- With Pontiac disappearing, where will Smokey and the Bandit and Kitt get their car parts?</p>
<p>- While the rest of us try to thread our way around your oversized SUV as you park in front of the supermarket doors, we wonder what you think that sign with the red slash across the letter P means.</p>
<p>- So, 129 people get the swine flu and everybody wants to wear a mask. A million people have AIDS and no one wants to wear a condom.</p>
<p>- While the WHO organization is tracking deaths from the H1N1 flu virus, could they also track deaths from the regular flu as well?</p>
<p>- I feel a bit sluggish today. I hope it's not the snail flu.</p>

<p>Health - The city is putting aside up to $1.5 million in case the H1N1 flu spreads throughout the city.</p>
<p>City council approved the potential spending Monday after hearing that costs for emergency equipment, other supplies and overtime could total more than $1 million.</p>
<p>Mayor Dave Bronconnier said the city has spent less than $500,000 so far to deal with the swine flu outbreak, but doesn't expect to spend more unless things get worse.</p>
<p>Monday's approval was only precautionary, he said.</p>
<p>"It does come with a cost, but the higher cost is not being prepared."</p>

<p>Alberta's pork industry will serve up 1,500 pulled pork sandwiches on the south grounds of the legislature Tuesday as part of a rally to support the embattled industry.</p>
<p>Two rallies -- one slated for Edmonton today and one in Calgary on Wednesday -- come as the pork industry tries to maintain consumer confidence in its products as the world deals with H1N1 flu, which was originally called "swine flu" by health officials.</p>
<p>China closed its doors to Alberta pork earlier this month, after it was reported that some pigs on a farm near Rocky Mountain House contracted H1N1.</p>
<p>"The pork lunch rallies are about showing support for our industry and demonstrating to consumers that they can be confident in the safety of Canadian pork," Roy Krause, Alberta Pork director of consumer services, said in a news release.</p>
<p>"We welcome people in Edmonton and Calgary to attend and enjoy lunch."</p>
<p>The pork sandwiches will be served from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the legislature. Industry officials said the premier and Alberta's minister of agriculture will speak at 11 a.m.</p>
<p>Alberta Pork officials also are asking Canadians to help by having an extra meal of pork each week.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Farmer's nightmare; Fate of his 2,200 pigs in bureaucratic limbo after some catch the flu</b>
</div><div>Darcy Henton, with files by Trish Audette   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>1313 words</div><div>12 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Arnold Van Ginkel says his flu-stricken hog farm and his livelihood hang in limbo while the government dithers over what to do with his 2,200 pigs.</p>
<p>For the 37-year-old Dutch immigrant, the solution is simple: destroy all the animals and compensate him for his loss.</p>
<p>"I think they should depopulate the herd as soon as possible and give me compensation for the animals, give me compensation for the loss of income and everybody can go back to normal life," Van Ginkel told The Journal in an interview Monday.</p>
<p>He and his wife, Alida, say they are frustrated with the way the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has handled the case.</p>
<p>The CFIA has quarantined his quarter-section of land, but appears reluctant to dispose of the animals, which are reproducing at a rate of more than 100 per week.</p>
<p>The Van Ginkels, who came to Canada from Holland in 2003 to settle on a mountain-view property north of Rocky Mountain House, say they have followed the rules and done everything they should have to protect human safety.</p>
<p>"I hope I am not punished because I have been honest and walked the route I should walk," said Van Ginkel, the father of six children, aged 11 months to 11 years.</p>
<p>The cull of about 500 market-ready hogs last Saturday will only buy another three weeks before his barns are again bursting at the seams, he said. He has no room to keep the 120-kilogram market-ready hogs and can't sell them.</p>
<p>Van Ginkel said the CFIA is testing the animals every three weeks, but the test results really don't make any difference because no one will buy his hogs now.</p>
<p>"Even if CFIA satisfies itself the disease is no longer in the herd, who will buy these animals? The answer is: no one."</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is transferable between pigs and humans.</p>
<p>Scientists believe a sick carpenter, who had recently returned from Mexico, may have spread the sickness to the animals when he was working in Van Ginkel's barn April 14.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later, Van Ginkel called a veterinarian when his pigs began coughing and showing symptoms of illness. He said the vet notified the CFIA, and officials appeared on his farm to take blood tests later the same day. But he said agency officials have been nearly invisible in the two weeks since.</p>
<p>"I phone them. I leave a message and they don't phone me back," he said.</p>
<p>Van Ginkel said he finally got so frustrated with the lack of response that he hired a lawyer who has arranged for a meeting today with CFIA and Alberta Agriculture officials.</p>
<p>CFIA officials couldn't be reached for comment Monday.</p>
<p>"If there's any risk to the public or the food system, we have to err on the side of caution," said Van Ginkel's lawyer, Keith Wilson. "The right thing to do is cull all the animals and remove any uncertainty."</p>
<p>They estimated it will cost about $500,000 to compensate Van Ginkel for the loss of his animals and loss of income for the next year while he starts over from scratch, Wilson said.</p>
<p>"If they want to take some of the animals and move them to a research facility, fine, but leaving him in this limbo-land and creating the lingering doubts around the world is nonsensical," he says.</p>
<p>Van Ginkel said disposing of the animals is best for him, the Alberta pork industry and Canada's reputation around the world as a food-producing nation.</p>
<p>He said he will be ruined financially if he isn't compensated for his hogs and for the loss of income while he rebuilds his herd.</p>
<p>"If they cull the herd and there's no compensation ... we'll definitely not make it," he said.</p>
<p>Alberta Agriculture Minister George Groene-veld has said the province did not support a cull because it wasn't necessary since the virus can't be spread by eating cooked pork. He suggested destroying the animals when they did not have to be destroyed would send a wrong message to the world that there is something wrong with Alberta pork.</p>
<p>Groeneveld said Monday the province is discussing the "best end-result" with Van Ginkel.</p>
<p>"I think we've been in pretty close touch with him and his family," Groeneveld said. "I can understand his frustrations, but we've been in the game here from Day 1."</p>
<p>At this stage, the decision to slaughter some or all of the herd is a provincial one, he said.</p>
<p>"It's not a food safety issue now," he said. "It's the overcrowding of the hogs and the inability for him to move them off the farm."</p>
<p>Asked whether he thinks the whole herd should have been destroyed from the start, Groeneveld said: "Hindsight is pretty easy on this one."</p>
<p>Some countries have banned Canadian pork since the outbreak, and the Philippines has agreed to continue importing Canadian pork as long as it is not from Alberta.</p>
<p>Paul Hodgman, Alberta Pork Producers executive director, said while science says the meat is safe, there's now a stigma attached to the animals in Van Ginkel's herd and Canada needs to restore the pork industry's reputation.</p>
<p>"I think this is special case," he said.</p>
<p>"We have to remove all doubt from anybody's mind about this particular product. Even though it flies in the face of science, we have to get business back to normal here as quickly as possible."</p>
<p>He said Van Ginkel's farm would be considered a relatively small hog operation compared to many of the association's 450 producers.</p>
<p>Stuart McKie, an Alberta Pork Producers policy analyst, has been assisting the family through the crisis, even watching over the children and fixing the washing machine.</p>
<p>"They are a wonderful family who just want normality back to their farm," he said. "They are just frustrated and confused. They did what they thought was the right thing to do and fail to understand why common sense hasn't prevailed."</p>

<p>- Infections have been reported in 30 countries. The United States has 2,532. Mexico, the disease epicentre, has 2,059 cases of the swine flu.</p>
<p>- The world total of deaths related to swine flu is 56 in Mexico, three in the United States, and one each in Canada and Costa Rica.</p>
<p>- The only Canadian to die so far was a woman from the Gift Lake Métis Settlement in northern Alberta who had checked herself into the High Prairie hospital because of asthma. Health Investigators don't believe she had any connection to Mexico.</p>
<p>- A young girl from the Edmonton area was hospitalized, but is recovering.</p>

<p>As Canada's public health agency confirmed 46 new cases across the country Monday, Toronto's University Health Network said four of its employees have tested positive for the H1N1 flu virus, including one who has had contact with patients.</p>
<p>In a staff memo Monday, UHN president and CEO Dr. Bob Bell said, "in the cases we've found people have been mildly ill and are all expected to return to health very quickly."</p>
<p>Bell said the hospital's health and safety and infection prevention and control departments "have done everything that they can" to limit the exposure of staff members and patients to any form of respiratory illness.</p>

<div>898 words</div><div>12 May 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>D4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>It used to be that you sized a bike by standing over the frame and making sure there were a few inches of clearance between you and the bike's top tube. Today, bike fitting is big business. It's also considered a necessity for riders who want comfort and performance from their bike.</p>
<p>How do you know if your bike fits? For most people, pain is the first sign that something is wrong. Sore knees, elbows, hands, neck and back as well as genitals that go numb in the saddle are all symptoms that your bike doesn't fit your body.</p>
<p>For most cyclists, pain doesn't set in until mileage increases. Jaunts around the neighbourhood rarely elicit the same kind of discomfort as do rides that keep a cyclist in the saddle for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>Many cyclists seek relief from a doctor or physiotherapist, only to be referred to a bike fit specialist who uses a tape measure, bike wrench and plumb line to make the pain go away. These specialists not only rejig your bike to fit your frame, they analyze your cycling posture and offer suggestions on how to improve peddling efficiency.</p>
<p>One of the best bike fitters in Montreal is Pierre Poulet, owner of Robert Cycle in LaSalle. He fits up to 800 cyclists a year, many of which are referred by local osteopaths, physiotherapists, chiropractors and physicians. The cyclists range from weekend warriors to the cycling elite, including cyclists with a special need, like a prosthesis.</p>
<p>"I do my best to fit everyone's body mass between two wheels," Poulet said.</p>
<p>It doesn't take much of a mismatch between cyclist and bike to cause discomfort. Legs that are long when compared to the length of the torso or vice versa are common reasons for a poor fit. So are long or short arms, lack of flexibility or stiffness in the neck, torso and hamstrings and chronic postural problems like disk pain.</p>
<p>Poulet watches cyclists peddle on a cycle trainer in his workshop while evaluating their posture and technique. Then he starts measuring and only then does he begin the fit.</p>
<p>A good fitter alters the bike's components relative to the cyclist's physical measurements and cycling style. Saddle height and position (fore and aft) are adjusted, handlebar height is altered and the crank (the component to which the pedals are attached) is sometimes replaced. The fitter tweaks the bike's parts millimetre by millimetre until bike and rider are in perfect harmony.</p>
<p>Some parts of the fit, like the saddle, are personal. Unlike several years ago when bike fitters spent a lot of time tilting the seat just so in order to relieve pressure on the genitalia, today's gender-specific cut-aways keep everyone's private parts more comfortable. This allows the cyclist to sit comfortably and the fitter time to focus his efforts on other parts of the bike.</p>
<p>The benefits of these adjustments are usually felt immediately. Cycling comfort improves and pain disappears. But there's another benefit: Improved position on a bike boosts cycling efficiency and performance.</p>
<p>Poulet, who also sells bikes, says a good fit is made easier by choosing the right bike. Selecting the optimum frame size and configuration (longer or shorter top tube) can significantly reduce the need to do a lot of extra work to perfect the fit.</p>
<p>His experience as a fitter has led him to carry only three models of bikes. Most people find the right fit on his top two models. For those who don't - hard to fit cyclists like short women and tall men - a custom-made bike, the third and most expensive option, might be the best choice.</p>
<p>As for triathletes who tend to ride in different positions during training and racing, Poulet does a combo fit that consists of an extra saddle, seat post and clip-on bar.</p>
<p>At this time of year Poulet is a busy guy, fitting twice as many bikes as he sells. A comprehensive fit takes about 90 minutes and costs $150. Most of the time cyclists leave happy and stay that way. A few, however, come back for still more minor adjustments. Fitting a bike isn't always about the perfect set of measurements. Comfort is very personal and can often be evaluated only after time spent on the bike in road conditions.</p>
<p>Not every cyclist needs to make an appointment with a bike fitter. But for those who can't get comfortable on their bike, a solution may be a trip to your local bike store for a personalized fit done by a seasoned professional.</p>

</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>A young adult who became mildly ill is the first confirmed case of the H1N1 flu virus in Waterloo Region.</p>
<p>Local health officials announced the case yesterday. It is one of 110 in Ontario, all of them mild, after 34 new cases were confirmed, including one in nearby Wellington County.</p>
<p>Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, associate medical officer of health for the region, wouldn't give out the person's age, gender or city of residence.</p>
<p>She said the person appears to have contracted the virus from a friend who had recently returned from Mexico. Wang said the person came down with typical flu symptoms 10 days ago, stayed home from work or school, and has now recovered.</p>
<p>"They started getting better and better once they stayed at home," she said.</p>
<p>The case came to light after the person went to their doctor and was tested.</p>
<p>Workplaces, schools and individuals aren't urged to take any special precautions beyond the usual advice during flu season. That includes covering your mouth and nose when sneezing, handwashing and staying home if symptoms appear.</p>
<p>In Wellington County, a 20-year-old man returned from Mexico feeling sick. He was confirmed to have the H1N1 flu on the weekend.</p>
<p>Wang said it's likely other people in this region already have H1N1 and expects there to be more confirmed cases as it spreads.</p>
<p>The local response to the virus will be determined by the number and severity of cases as health officials monitor the situation.</p>
<p>"Right now our recommendations are simply increased vigilance and making sure people continue to be prudent with the handwashing and all that, especially staying at home if they are ill," Wang said.</p>

<p>Symptoms of the H1N1 virus (human swine flu) are similar to seasonal influenza (flu), including headache, chills and cough followed by fever, loss of appetite, muscle aches and fatigue, runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes and throat irritation. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may occur in adults as well as in children. In more severe cases, or in people with chronic conditions, complications such as pneumonia may develop.</p>
<p>People returning from Mexico who have symptoms of respiratory illness should contact their health care provider or call Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>The first case of H1N1 flu in Wellington County was confirmed yesterday by Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health.</p>
<p>"We have our first lab-confirmed case and it's a mild case, in that the patient didn't require hospitalization," said Janice Walters, manager of infectious disease.</p>
<p>Walters said a 20-year-old male returned from Mexico in early May and went to see his doctor after feeling unwell for days.</p>
<p>The doctor sent a sample to the Central Public Health Laboratory in Toronto early last week and over the weekend the test came back positive.</p>
<p>"That's typical," Walters said of the time lag.</p>
<p>"The Toronto lab is quite burdened right now."</p>
<p>And no wonder. Yesterday Ontario's chief medical officer of health announced 34 new cases have been confirmed in Ontario, including the one case here and one in Waterloo Region, bringing the total of confirmed cases in Ontario to 110.</p>
<p>But that's no reason to panic, Walters said.</p>
<p>"We're concerned with this strain of influenza because it has the potential for small drifts or big shifts," Walters said. "Scientists have identified the components from swine and avian influenza."</p>
<p>Walters said, "But this strain is following a typical pattern -- it spreads quickly but most people are recovering. It's not that different from the season strain of influenza we see every year."</p>
<p>Walters said the Wellington man is on the mend and is not being quarantined. She said local public health is awaiting results of a few more tests of people in the area.</p>
<p>Our best defence is good hygiene, said Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Acting Chief Medical Officer of Health.</p>
<p>"Ontarians should continue to protect themselves and those around them by washing hands frequently, coughing or sneezing into your sleeve, and staying at home if you're sick," he stated in a release.</p>
<p>Walters said doctors and hospitals have been instructed to observe their patients for symptoms and report any suspected cases to public health.</p>
<p>"Especially if there's a link to travel, people who aren't feeling well should stay isolated," she said.</p>

</p>
<p>Despite some confirmed local cases of swine flu, a.k.a. H1N1 2009, public concern over the illness hasn't reached panic mode -- at least if snap polls serve as a guide.</p>
<p>One of The Spec's online surveys last week suggested that around 70 per cent of respondents had not changed their habits in response to the outbreak.</p>
<p>I'll admit I wasn't one of them.</p>
<p>Over the last little while I found myself carrying around a little vial of hand sanitizer, and foregoing shaking hands in favour of greeting people from a distance with the Star Trek "Vulcan salute."</p>
<p>Thankfully, Hamilton's public health department came out with useful recommendations on how to guard against influenza.</p>
<p>Included among those suggestions were getting the proper amount of sleep, exercise and eating nutritious food. Dr. Chris Mackie, Hamilton's associate medical officer of health, noted that a nutritious diet "improves immunity and makes people less susceptible to illness." That's good advice at any time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for many Hamiltonians, a nutritious diet isn't always an option.</p>
<p>Dr. Mackie noted there has been some suggestion that one of the reasons the H1N1 flu may have resulted in higher mortality rates in Mexico is because of the depth of poverty in that country. Past pandemics have tended to hit developing countries the hardest.</p>
<p>Clear links exist between poverty and health. A recent report received by the city's board of health noted that "High income ... does not guarantee good health; but low income almost inevitably ensures poor health and significant health inequity in Canada."</p>
<p>According to Canada's food guide, fruits and vegetables should make up half of our daily diet, and yet for a significant chunk of our population, greens are not a part of the diet -- not because they don't want them, but because they can't afford them.</p>
<p>There are several challenges. Besides being expensive at grocery stores (prices for vegetables jumped 26 per cent, and 19 per cent for fruit in just the last year), fresh produce isn't usually available at food banks.</p>
<p>If fruits or vegetables get donated, they are usually nearing the end of their shelf life.</p>
<p>There are some great local initiatives trying to change that.</p>
<p>Joanne Santucci, the intrepid executive director of Hamilton Foodshare, has been working with farmers, social enterprises and corporations to try to provide the 16,000 people (6,000 children) in our city who visit a food bank every month with more nutritious food.</p>
<p>One of the success stories has included partnering with a program called Farm Share Canada, started by Llew Smith of E.D. Smith Farms, to distribute fresh cherries and other fruits to local food banks in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>"Cherries were literally picked off the tree, and our emergency food distribution centre was able to get them across the city to front-line programs within 12 hours of receiving them," noted Santucci.</p>
<p>Santucci's long-term dream is to have a truck for a travelling farmers' market to "go right into our hardest-hit neighbourhoods and bring fresh fruits and vegetables to the seniors and families in Hamilton" who are "struggling and who would not otherwise have access to these nutritious items."</p>
<p>The Ontario Association of Food Banks recently came out with a proposal to create a tax credit for food producers and processors who donate fruits and vegetables. Their briefing paper to the Ontario government noted "millions of pounds of fresh, nutritious food is disposed of or plowed back into farmer's fields in Ontario."</p>
<p>If there were incentives to get that produce to where it could be used, it would not only help feed families who are struggling, but also help ensure a healthier diet -- which leads to lower health care costs for us all.</p>
<p>The Campaign for Adequate Welfare & Disability Benefits and community partners will be sponsoring a public forum on Poverty and Health a week Thursday, May 21, at 1:30 at First Pilgrim United Church, 200 Main St. E., in Hamilton. The public is welcome to attend.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Halton source of flu in Japan?; Returning students quarantined</b>
</div><div>Carmela Fragomeni   </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>639 words</div><div>12 May 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A04</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.   </div>
</p>
<p>With six new swine flu cases in Halton -- five of them students -- and questions from Japan about exchange students who became that country's first cases after returning from Oakville, local school authorities and health officials are scrambling to get information out quickly.</p>
<p>All six Halton residents newly confirmed with the flu are recovering at home while the Japanese students and their teachers are in quarantine in Japan after being checked at the airport when they arrived home Thursday.</p>
<p>Halton has 11 H1N1 flu cases now. All cases are mild and none had travelled recently. That is evidence the virus is spreading within the community and makes handwashing and staying home if ill all the more important, said Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton's medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Of the 11 cases, nine are students from four different schools. The other two are adults, one in their 20s and the most recent in their 40s, Nosal said.</p>
<p>One student attends Christ the King high school in Georgetown and another St. Luke's Catholic elementary school in Oakville.</p>
<p>In Hamilton, the health department reported a new confirmed case yesterday, bringing the city's total to two. Both are adult males, one in his 20s and another in his 30s. Both recently travelled to Mexico, said Dr. Chris Mackie, associate medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Ontario has confirmed 34 new cases of swine flu since Saturday, bringing the total number of cases in the province to 110. There are 330 cases across Canada.</p>
<p>Nosal and Mackie expect more cases, but say if the swine flu strain is similar to other strains, the number of cases should drop when warmer weather arrives.</p>
<p>"Hopefully, we'll be over this very quickly," said Nosal.</p>
<p>Mackie said the virus doesn't spread as easily when people are outdoors, instead of in close contact inside. "It would be very unusual to get an epidemic at this time of the year," he said.</p>
<p>Health officials in Halton, however, are as busy as they were during the West Nile virus spread and SARS outbreak several years ago, Nosal said.</p>
<p>Japanese journalists are among those besieging Halton officials for information. The quarantined 30 students and six teachers is a huge news story in Japan because they are the first cases of H1N1 flu in that country.</p>
<p>Reporter teams from two Japanese television stations were in Oakville over the weekend and at the Halton Catholic school board yesterday for a news briefing. They also interviewed students at St. Ignatius of Loyola high school where 10 of the Japanese students and two teachers were billeted by Loyola students and their families.</p>
<p>Board officials say there are no flu cases at Loyola or at Mother Teresa, an Oakville elementary school visited by some of the exchange group. They have sent letters home to parents at both schools and will be sending letters to parents at St. Luke's today, said board spokesperson Chris Jewel.</p>
<p>The Japanese students were part of a regular cultural and educational exchange between schools in Oakville and Neyagawa, Japan, which have been twinned cities for a number of years. Two Halton public high schools also billeted some of the exchange students.</p>
<p>Although Halton Catholic board Superintendent John Langill said officials here have not received reports of confirmed swine flu cases among the Japanese students, reports from Japan say there were four confirmed cases as of yesterday.</p>
<p>The students and their teachers were in Oakville for two weeks from April 24 until Thursday. Langill said the group visited various tourist locales including Niagara Falls and socialized with their host students and their friends, but he doesn't know where they could have come in contact with the virus.</p>

<p>Re: Outside review suggests Canada Post drop door-to-door mail delivery (May 5). Anyone who actually read the entire report would immediately realize that it says no to deregulation but threatens rural post offices.</p>
<p>I invite Free Press readers to look at the report and try to find a single recommendation to take away door-to-door delivery or go after current labour costs. Readers will find that there is none.</p>
<p>What the report does suggest is that there are a number of alternatives that Canada Post can pursue to address issues associated with a potential gradual decline in mail volumes. The alternatives include raising postal rates (currently among the lowest in the world), introducing new technology, leveraging its assets to add new sources of revenue, cutting back on rural services and reviewing the mode of delivery taking into account both the costs and environmental impact of moving from door-to-door delivery to centralized locations.</p>
<p>It should be noted that delivery to the home is the most environmentally friendly mode of delivery, especially in rural areas.</p>

<p>For some time I have been trying to persuade our federal NDP party to offer voters a chance to elect a federal government that would truly level the education playing field by fully financing educational pursuits at both universities and technical colleges (as they have done in Ireland). Not only is it and old socialist's dream, it makes common sense.</p>
<p>Taxpayers already finance an overwhelming percentage of higher learning cost, whether it be Sid's 75 per cent or my 80-plus per cent is of little consequence.</p>
<p>I would add one caveat: the graduating students be required to sign a contractual commitment to remain in Canada for five years or they would be obligated to pay back to society the costs of their higher learning on a pro-rated basis.</p>

<p>Paving at a pace</p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me how inept we are at road repair and construction. Why is it that it takes over a full summer to repave a small section of Ness Avenue, for example, when in other parts of the country with similar weather conditions they can pave miles of road in less than a month.</p>
<p>I witnessed a recycling asphalt paving machine that grinds up existing asphalt, mixes it with new asphalt and relays a new surface all in one application. It travels at one mile per hour and does the whole job.</p>
<p>Calculating that to Winnipeg streets, one would think we could do the whole city in a summer!</p>

<p>Pig farms the issue</p>
<p>Re: Baseless fear of pigs, by Andrew Dickson (May 4). Whoa! Hold on a minute, Mr. Dickson. Doesn't your suggestion that swine flu is somehow not connected to intensive livestock operations (ILOs) also involve, as you put it, an "incredible" leap in logic?</p>
<p>The fact is that scientists have long warned that hog ILOs provide an ideal setting for swine flu virus mutation and interspecies transmission, notwithstanding so-called bio-security protocols.</p>
<p>Indeed, late last week scientists studying the current swine flu virus at the Center for Computational Biology at Columbia University reported evidence that it is a variant of a known virus that evolved in a North Carolina factory farm.</p>
<p>While their results have received little attention in the Canadian media, they do reinforce the factory farm-swine flu virus linkage emphasized in the Mexican press. In April, Mexico City's La Journada identified the Smithfield Foods' Carroll Ranches ILO complex, producing 950,000 hogs annually, as the "cause" of the flu outbreak in Perote.</p>
<p>None of this taints an entire species. It does, however, point to the need to objectively investigate the fundamental health issues ingredient in the "modern" industrial form of pork production.</p>

<p>W-FIVE responds</p>
<p>I am writing in response to Robert Marshall's W-FIVE's faint defence fails (May 3). There were points that were stated incorrectly and some issues that require clarification.</p>
<p>Marshall states that Pavel Kulisek was "hanging around with Gustavo Rivera Martinez" and "a third man, Marcos Hernandez." What he omitted was that Kulisek did not know their real names. He believed that his two "friends" were Carlos Herrera and Eduardo. A check of the court documents would have shown that not only did Pavel state this was the case, but that Hernandez admitted in a sworn examination that he and Rivera did not use their real names around Pavel and he did not know who they were.</p>
<p>There was an important fact omitted in the discussion of Mexican justice where "40 per cent of the people in custody are awaiting trail." There is a profound difference between waiting times in Canada and in Mexico. According to Statistics Canada, the average wait in Canada is one to seven days. In Mexico the wait is around two years.</p>
<p>The portrayal of Tamara Taraciuk as "a human rights lawyer who chatted about the poor state of Mexican justice" seems to question her ability to speak from a position of authority on this issue. During the research for this program, we heard the same stories again and again about how dysfunctional that system is. Taraciuk was chosen because her writing on these issues was the most recent.</p>
<p>Finally, Marshall suggested that there should have been a "forensic accountant to shine a cold light on the books." There was. The Mexican prosecutor (for some unknown reason) chose not to do this, so the defence had one completed by an independent auditor and offered the results to the prosecutor. The forensic audit showed that all of the Kulisek's money "for their house and vacation" could be traced to loans and mortgages and savings from Canadian banks.</p>
<p>The broadcast clearly showed that once again a miscarriage of justice has taken place involving a Canadian citizen in Mexico and our government seems unable or unwilling to do much about it.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pulling for pork producers - China's ban hurting Neepawa plant</b>

<p>CHINA'S ban on pork shipments from Alberta over an outbreak of swine flu is having repercussions for a Manitoba pork company.</p>
<p>Claude Vielfaure, a partner in <span class="companylink">Hytek Ltd</span>., which operates a pork-processing plant at Neepawa, said the Chinese government is even balking at taking pork that passes through the western province on the way to the Port of Vancouver.</p>
<p>"It's an extremely strange position," Vielfaure said.</p>
<p>Hytek ships pork weekly by truck to Vancouver, where the sealed containers are put on ships bound for China and Japan. The company became aware of China's objections to using Alberta as a transportation route late last week, Vielfaure said.</p>
<p>"Our meat sales guys, as of end of last week, were obviously trying to find alternatives to be able to get our pork there," he said at a pork barbecue co-hosted by the province and the Manitoba Pork Council on the grounds of the legislature Monday to show support for the industry.</p>
<p>Vielfaure said Hytek is checking the legality of sending trucks into the U.S. and crossing back into Canada in B.C.</p>
<p>Canadian and U.S. hog producers have seen some international markets close and prices plummet since the outbreak of H1N1 flu, also referred to as swine flu. China is one of a few important customers to restrict imports of pork from Canada. It banned shipments from Alberta after pigs at a farm there came down with the flu after an employee returned from a trip to Mexico.</p>
<p>Hytek Inc., headquartered in LaBroquerie, is Canada's largest hog producer, producing 1.4 million pigs annually in Canada and the U.S. In addition to pork shipments, the company has also shipped swine breeding stock to China.</p>
<p>On Monday, Premier Gary Doer donned an apron and stood beside pork council president Karl Kynoch to serve pork on a bun to a crowd that included cabinet ministers, MLAs, farmers and civil servants, including Joel Kettner, the chief provincial public health officer.</p>

<p>Toronto -- The National Gallery of Canada is facing possible layoffs, predicting attendance and revenue shortfalls for 2009-2010, an Ottawa paper reported. New director Marc Mayer asked staff to consider early retirement, job sharing and unpaid leave, citing swine flu as a threat to attendance. The Gallery budget is approximately $60-million, $50-million of which comes from the federal government. J.B.</p>

<p>What happens to a pig when it gets swine flu?</p>
<p>It coughs, it sneezes, it gets a runny nose and (perhaps fittingly) it is stricken with conjunctivitis, better known to any parent who has picked up a kid from summer camp as "pink eye."</p>
<p>More colourfully, the animal develops "plum-coloured" lung lesions that in a pathological examination are large enough to be seen with the naked eye, according to a study of piglets conducted at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.</p>
<p>Though some of the 22-day-old swine showed no symptoms until four days after they were infected, all of the piglets eventually came down with the illness.</p>
<p>However, none of them died - an outcome that arguably helps explain the recent proliferation of dubious online jokes recommending the liberal application of "oinkment."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vigilance urged as more hospital workers get swine flu</b>

</p>
<p>Staff at the University Health Network are being urged to be extra vigilant about infection control after three more employees tested positive for swine flu.</p>
<p>Health network spokesperson Gillian Howard confirmed last night that there are now four workers who have tested positive for the H1N1 virus, including one case reported last week. One of the employees has had patient contact.</p>
<p>Three of the infected staffers work at Princess Margaret Hospital, which specializes in cancer care. Howard would not reveal at which campus the fourth staffer works. The health network also comprises Toronto General Hospital and Toronto Western Hospital.</p>
<p>A bulletin to staff was to be posted on the UHN's website last night, asking staff to take care not to spread any bugs.</p>
<p>"I am asking all members of the PMH team and all patients at PMH to be extra vigilant with regard to flu symptoms," UHN president Robert Bell states in an advance copy of the bulletin obtained by the Star.</p>
<p>Two infected Princess Margaret employees caught the bug from a colleague, whose case was made public last week. That employee, plus one of the newly infected employees, is believed to have caught the virus in the community, Howard said.</p>
<p>A total of 110 Ontarians have tested positive for H1N1. All cases have been mild, with symptoms no worse than the seasonal flu. No one has required hospitalization.</p>
<p>Howard said she is not aware that any patient has contracted the virus from staff, but she said there is a concern this might happen.</p>
<p>She said UHN patients with cancer or awaiting or having undergone transplants might be more at risk from the flu.</p>
<p>"Our patients are always vulnerable ... I would say that our patients who are immune-compromised are already very alert to the fact they need to be careful," she said.</p>
<p>"The risk is always there that any patient may contract flu while at our hospitals or out in the community. This is a community-acquired disease," she said.</p>
<p>Howard emphasized patients and visitors should not be afraid to come to UHN.</p>
<p>"This flu could be caught anywhere," she said.</p>
<p>Howard said many employees are being tested for H1N1.</p>
<p>"I would say that we are swabbing many, many more people than we have ever swabbed before. That's because anybody who is presenting with these symptoms is getting swabbed," she explained, adding those being tested could include people merely suffering from allergies or non-swine strains of the flu.</p>
<p>There have now been about 4,800 confirmed cases of H1N1 in 30 countries. There have been 61 deaths. Canada has reported a total of 330 cases.</p>

</p>
<p>As Canada's public health agency confirmed 46 new cases across the country yesterday, Toronto's University Health Network said four of its employees have now tested positive for the H1N1 flu virus, including one who has had contact with patients.</p>
<p>UHN would not reveal which of the network's three hospitals the individuals work at due to privacy reasons, said spokeswoman Gillian Howard.</p>
<p>In a staff memo yesterday, UHN president and CEO Dr. Bob Bell said, "in the cases we've found . . . people have been mildly ill and are all expected to return to health very quickly."</p>
<p>Bell said the hospital's health and safety and infection prevention and control departments "have done everything that they can" to limit the exposure of staff members and patients.</p>
<p>"I see no evidence that we have any cause for concern beyond our day-to-day approach of taking standard infection control precautions with unknown respiratory illness," he said.</p>
<p>One of the infected staff members works at Princess Margaret Hospital in downtown Toronto, according to a staff memo on May 5, when the first case of swine flu was confirmed in a hospital employee.</p>
<p>"This individual was not providing patient care and is now recuperating at home," Bell said.</p>
<p>There are now a total of 110 H1N1 cases in Ontario, all considered mild.</p>
<p>The number of cases in the province jumped by 34 yesterday, followed by six in Saskatchewan, four in Alberta, and one each in Quebec and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Yesterday's numbers bring the national total to 330 infections, 79 of them in B.C.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization's acting assistant director-general, Keiji Fukuda, said yesterday it was too early to say whether the situation would stabilize or whether the virus would develop into a pandemic.</p>
<p>"We remain at Phase 5," Fukuda said, referring to the agency's second-highest pandemic alert level.</p>
<p>"It is still a confusing situation."</p>
<p>Also yesterday, Mexican authorities raised the death toll to 56 from 48.</p>
<p>A study by Mexico's National Institute of Genomic Medicine released yesterday may explain why fatalities from the H1N1 flu virus to date have occurred almost exclusively in Mexico.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Dr. Gerardo Jimenez-Sanchez said: "Knowledge of genomic variability in the Mexican [Mestizo] population can allow the identification of genetic variations that confer susceptibility to common diseases, including infections such as the flu."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, three Japanese citizens returning from Ontario became the first confirmed cases of the virus in Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese authorities quarantined a male teacher, 46, and two students, both 16, who had been on a high school trip to Oakville, Ont.</p>

</p>
<p>The new H1N1 virus shows no signs of sustained person-to-person spread outside of North America where the infection first emerged, a top World Health Organization official said Monday.</p>
<p>Keiji Fukuda, acting assistant director-general, also told a news briefing it was too early to say whether the situation would stabilize or whether the virus would develop into a pandemic.</p>
<p>"We remain at Phase 5," Fukuda said, referring to the agency's second-highest pandemic alert level. "It is still a confusing situation."</p>
<p>The United Nations organization also confirmed Monday at least 4,694 cases of the new strain of swine flu, while Mexican authorities raised the death toll to 56 from 48.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canada's public health agency confirmed 46 new cases across the country Monday.</p>
<p>The number of cases in Ontario jumped by 34 on Monday, followed by six in Saskatchewan, four in Alberta, and one each in Quebec and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Monday's numbers bring the national total to 330 infections: 110 in Ontario, 79 in B.C., 57 in Nova Scotia, 52 in Alberta, 16 in Quebec, 10 in Saskatchewan, three in P.E.I., two in New Brunswick and one in Manitoba.</p>
<p>A study by Mexico's National Institute of Genomic Medicine released Monday may explain why fatalities from the H1N1 flu virus to date have occurred almost exclusively in Mexico.</p>
<p>Researchers discovered that the genetic composition of the Mexican Mestizo populations are substantially different from the three other known human genetic subgroups -- Caucasians of European descent, the Chinese and Japanese of Asia and Yoruba from Africa.</p>
<p>"It is not possible today to say genetic variation is responsible for the unique H1N1 Influenza A mortality rate in Mexico," said lead researcher Dr. Gerardo Jimenez-Sanchez. "However, knowledge of genomic variability in the Mexican population can allow the identification of genetic variations that confer susceptibility to common diseases, including infections such as the flu."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, three Japanese citizens returning from Ontario became the first confirmed cases of the virus in Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese authorities quarantined a male teacher, 46, and two students, both 16, who had been on a high school trip to Canada. The teacher and students had stayed in Oakville, west of Toronto, from April 24 until last Thursday. The teacher was given Tamiflu while the two students were recovering, officials said.</p>
<p>Forty-nine others who were aboard their flight on Friday from Detroit to Tokyo were also quarantined.</p>
<p>While most infections are mild and haven't required hospitalization, Canada's first death related to the H1N1 virus was reported Friday: Tina L'Hirondelle, 39, from the northern Alberta Metis settlement of Gift Lake died April 28. Officials with Alberta Health and Wellness said she had checked herself into hospital in High Prairie, Alta., with asthma.</p>
<p>While a typical seasonal flu makes thousands of Canadians sick and kills an average of 4,000 Canadians every year, the death is making Alberta look like a flu hot spot.</p>

<p>RONALDO PLAN B</p>
<p>Manchester United is already making contingency plans should Cristiano Ronaldo decamp for Real Madrid this summer. The Guardian newspaper reported last week that United has put in an offer for French international Franck Ribery that would break the world-record transfer fee. Sources in Germany told the newspaper Bayern Munich has received an offer believed to be worth $108 million for the midfielder. United's offer comfortably shatters the record $76 million Real Madrid paid for Zinedine Zidane in 2001. The offer for Ribery is contingent on Ronaldo leaving for Real, as has been frequently rumoured. You can be sure Real will have to pay even more than the Ribery transfer fee to land the Portuguese international. Ribery has said he would leave Bayern if the team fails to qualify for the Champions League. Bayern is locked in a four-team dogfight atop the Bundesliga. The top two teams make the Champions League.</p>
<p>OH, SHUT UP</p>
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo, who has made no secret of his desire to play in Spain one day, now says he no longer dreams of playing for Real Madrid.</p>
<p>"I'm no longer thinking of Madrid. That dream is dead," Ronaldo told The People newspaper. "The only thing I dream about now is Manchester United and winning the Champions League again in Rome." Meanwhile, Ramon Calderon, a former Real Madrid president, hinted recently that a deal to bring Ronaldo to Madrid was in place. This long-running saga just won't go away.</p>
<p>DESCHAMPS SET Former French international captain Didier Deschamps is set to take over as Marseille coach. He will take over from Eric Gerets, who announced he would step down at the end of this season, even though he guided Marseille into title contention. "After Eric Gerets, Marseille could only set their sights on a top coach," the club announced on its website. "The choice of Didier Deschamps, whose playing and coaching career speak for him, was a natural one." Deschamps coached Monaco to the 2004 Champions League final and helped Juventus win promotion back to Serie A in Italy in the 2006-07 season.</p>
<p>DEAD MAN WALKING</p>
<p>Juventus coach Claudio Ranieri surely will be looking for a new job after this season. Juve has dropped out of contention in Serie A after a series of pedestrian performances and a seven-game winless streak heading into the weekend. Jean-Claude Blanc, the Turin club's general manager, says Ranieri is still in charge, at least for the season's final games, "and then we'll see." Blanc summoned Ranieri for crisis talks last week and said no job is safe. "The figures in a club are tied to the results on the field," Blanc said. "Today's message is we are all in the same boat." VAN BASTEN OUT Marco Van Basten, a great striker for Holland, has been less successful as a coach. He resigned last week as bench boss at Ajax Amsterdam after the biggest Dutch club failed to qualify for the Champions League. The resignation came despite the backing of Ajax general director Rik Van den Boog, who called the season "an ugly knock on the head," but said Van Basten's job was safe. The coach said he was resigning because the team's objectives had not been met and he didn't foresee any improvement next season.</p>
<p>FLU-RIDDEN</p>
<p>Mexican teams have withdrawn from the Libertadores Cup tournament after Latin American teams refused to play then because of fears of H1N1 flu. The cup matches teams from South America and Mexico. Teams from Uruguay and Brazil refused to travel to Mexico last week for games against San Luis and Guadalajara. Mind you, the Mexicans haven't exactly been paragons of virtue. Last week in Chile, an angry Guadalajara player spat and blew his nose at an opponent, then told him he had the flu. He was suspended from the tournament a few days later. Mexican players complained that opposing players taunted them about the flu during the game.</p>

</div><div>Canwest News Service; AFP</div>
<div>660 words</div><div>11 May 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>H1N1 flu has infected 4,379 people in 29 countries, the World Health Organization said yesterday, as five more Canadians tested positive, all of them in the Prairies.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada reported three new cases in Alberta and two more in Saskatchewan yesterday, bringing the national total to 286.</p>
<p>The UN agency meanwhile said Mexico has reported 1,626 confirmed cases, up from 1,364 on Saturday, and repeated that 45 people have died there from the new flu strain that is a genetic mixture of swine, bird and human viruses.</p>
<p>The Mexican government has said the worst is over and eased restrictions on commercial and public activity in the country that has been at the epicentre of the outbreak.</p>
<p>The health organization's latest flu tally increased the number of confirmed infections in the United States to 2,254 from 1,639 reported on Saturday, while the number of reported deaths remained at two.</p>
<p>However, U.S. officials on Saturday said a man died from the new flu in Washington state last week, bringing the toll in the United States to three.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, China reported its first suspected case of H1N1 flu, a Chinese man in Sichuan province who had returned from studying in the United States, China's Health Ministry said.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old man was being treated in a hospital in provincial capital Chengdu and has been placed in quarantine, the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, three Japanese citizens returning from Ontario became the first confirmed cases of the virus in Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese authorities quarantined a 46-year-old male teacher and two students, both 16-year-old youths, who had been on a high school trip to Canada.</p>
<p>The teacher and students had stayed in Oakville, west of Toronto, from April 24 until last Thursday. The teacher was being given Tamiflu, while the two students were recovering, officials said.</p>
<p>Forty-nine others who were aboard their flight on Friday from Detroit to Tokyo were also quarantined.</p>
<p>The number of cases in B.C. jumped by 19 on Saturday, followed by 15 in Ontario, four in Alberta and one in Quebec.</p>
<p>The big jump in B.C. comes as technicians got caught up with lab work, the B.C. Centre for Disease Control said.</p>
<p>After yesterday's numbers, that brings the national total to 286 infections: 79 in B.C., 76 in Ontario, 56 in Nova Scotia, 49 in Alberta, 16 in Quebec, three in P.E.I., four in Saskatchewan and two in New Brunswick, and one in Manitoba.</p>
<p>While most infections are mild and haven't required hospitalization, Canada's first death related to the H1N1 virus was reported Friday: Tina L'Hirondelle, a 39-year-old woman on the northern Alberta Métis settlement of Gift Lake, who died April 28. Officials with Alberta Health and Wellness said she had checked herself into hospital in High Prairie, Alta., with asthma problems.</p>
<p>Gift Lake is about 400 kilometres north of Edmonton.</p>
<p>Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services, said it won't be known until next week if the woman died from the flu or from complications from her existing medical problems. She did not have a history of travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>As the strain continues to circulate, an increasing number of confirmed H1N1 infections in Canada will have no obvious links to</p>
<p>Mexico, said a spokesman for Alberta Health and Wellness on Saturday.</p>
<p>For instance, of the 46 cases in Alberta, seven patients have no history of recent travel, and seven more lack a confirmed link to another country.</p>
<p>While a typical seasonal flu makes thousands of Canadians sick and kills an average of 4,000 Canadians every year, the death is making Alberta look like a flu hot spot.</p>

<p>H1N1 flu has infected 4,379 people in 29 countries, the World Health Organization said on Sunday, as five more Canadians tested positive, all in the Prairies.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada reported three new cases in Alberta and two more in Saskatchewan on Sunday, bringing the national total to 286.</p>
<p>The UN agency meanwhile said Mexico has reported 1,626 confirmed cases, up from 1,364 on Saturday, and repeated that 45 people have died there from the new flu strain that is a genetic mixture of swine, bird and human viruses.</p>
<p>The Mexican government has said the worst is over and eased restrictions on commercial and public activity in the country that has been at the epicentre of the outbreak.</p>
<p>The health organization's latest flu tally increased the number of confirmed infections in the United States to 2,254 from 1,639 reported on Saturday. U. S. officials said a man died from the new flu in Washington state last week, bringing the death toll in the U. S. to three.</p>
<p>Also Sunday, China reported its first suspected case of H1N1 flu, a Chinese man in Sichuan province who had returned from studying in the United States, China's Health Ministry said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old man was being treated in a hospital.</p>

</p>
<p>M eet Barack Obama, standup comic.</p>
<p>For a few short hours Saturday night, the U. S. president put aside concerns about a global swine flu outbreak and the stability of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal for a turn as joke teller-in-chief at the White House Correspondents'Association dinner in Washington.</p>
<p>And no one was spared.</p>
<p>Playing to a crowd that ranged from reporters in rented tuxedos to celebrity A-listers such as Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise, Obama skewered former presidential rival Hillary Clinton, poked fun at beleaguered U. S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and inspired groans with a torture joke about a certain former vice-president.</p>
<p>He even cracked wise about his reputation for having an oversized ego. "Good evening, everybody, I would like to welcome you to the 10-day anniversary of my First 100 Days," Obama told a crowd of 2,500 at the Washington Hilton.</p>
<p>"During the second 100 days, we will design, build and open a library dedicated to my first 100 days. My next 100 days will be so successful, I will complete them in 72 days. And on the 73rd day, I will rest."</p>
<p>Quipping about his oft-criticized use of Teleprompters, and his vice-president's reputation for loose lips, Obama said: "In the next hundred days, I will learn to go off prompter --and Joe Biden will learn to stay on it."</p>
<p>It was Obama's debut performance at the biggest event on Washington's social calendar, a $200-a-ticket affair that has become known as Hollywood on the Potomac for the number of high-wattage stars it draws.</p>
<p>With Republican George W. Bush back in Texas, however, there was a marked jump in the number of entertainment industry liberals at the event.</p>
<p>Spielberg huddled with George Lucas. Cruise and his wife, Katie Holmes, mingled near fellow power couples Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore, and Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick. The guest list also included actor Owen Wilson, model Tyra Banks, designer Donatella Versace, TV journalist Barbara Walters and rocker Bon Jovi.</p>
<p>Canadian content came in the former of Austin Powers' star Michael Myers, who was seated near the head table with Meet the Press host David Gregory.</p>
<p>Federal Industry Minister Tony Clement -- less political star than stargazer--made the trip from Ottawa to catch Obama's act.</p>
<p>"I must confess I really did not want to be here tonight,"Obama said, opening his speech, "but I knew I had to come.That's one more problem that I inherited from George W. Bush."</p>
<p>Referring to the long and frequently bitter Democratic presidential primary in 2008, Obama assured the audience that Hillary Clinton had put aside her presidential ambitions to help him solve international crises like the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"We had been rivals during the campaign, but these days we could not be closer,"he said of his secretary of state. "In fact, the second she got back from Mexico, she pulled me into a hug and gave me a big kiss. Told me to get down there myself."</p>
<p>Obama steered clear of jokes about the sensitive issue of waterboarding terror suspects. Well, almost.</p>
<p>"Dick Cheney was supposed to be here, but he is very busy working on his memoir, tentatively titled, 'How to shoot friends and interrogate people,' " he said.</p>
<p>Obama said one of his biggest goals for his second 100 days in office was to house-train the first family's new dog, Bo.</p>
<p>"The last thing Tim Geithner needs is someone else treating him like a fire hydrant," he said, referring to his treasury secretary, who has been cast as incompetent by some in the media for his handling of the U. S. financial crisis.</p>
<p>The night's paid entertainment came from comedian Wanda Sykes, who poked only gentle fun at Obama while taking her biggest shots at conservative politicians.</p>
<p>Noting how African-Americans were proud to finally have the nation's first black president, Sykes said: "That's unless you screw up. And then it's going to be--what's up with the half-white guy."</p>
<p>She jibed Michelle Obama for breaking protocol and putting her arm around Queen Elizabeth last month in London, saying the first lady treated the monarch "like she just slid into home plate--way to go, Queen!"</p>
<p>Sykes' biggest target was radio talk-show</p>
<p>comedian Wanda Sykes roasts republican politicians at the annual White house correspondents' association dinner.</p>

<p>actress natalie Portman added to the glam factor at Saturday's media gala in Washington.</p>
<p>host Rush Limbaugh, who said after Obama's election that he hoped the president would fail.</p>
<p>"I think Rush Limbaugh was the 20th hijacker, but he was just so strung out on OxyContin, he missed his flight,"Sykes said, referring to the radio host's former addiction to painkillers.</p>
<p>Sykes' performance -- tough on Republicans, easy on Obama --is likely to stir controversy among U. S. conservatives, who are still smarting over comedian Stephen Colbert's withering critique of Bush at the 2006 event.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Alberta touts holidays at home; Drop in foreign visitors behind $5.6M pitch</b>
</div><div>Tamara Gignac   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>777 words</div><div>11 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>A s far as recessionary buzzwords go, it's hard to beat the word "staycation."</p>
<p>The phrase--a catchy way to describe a holiday spent close to home -- is popular with Cindy Ady. As the minister responsible for the province's $5-billion tourism industry, it might even be her favourite word.</p>
<p>Ady has a message for penny-pinching Albertans leery of spending their earnings on a costly overseas trip or fearful about the H1N1 flu: take a trip close to home instead.</p>
<p>It's never been a better time to visit the badlands, take the kids to a historical site or spend a romantic weekend in Lake Louise.</p>
<p>"We're hoping people will choose to visit parts of the province they haven't explored before," Ady said.</p>
<p>"It's always easy to sell a good product and we have it."</p>
<p>The government hopes its $5.6-million "Stay" campaign --now in its second year-- will offset a worrisome decline in U. S. travel, which began to slow in 2008 amid record-high fuel prices and has continued to languish as Americans and other international visitors forgo holiday plans amid a slumping economy.</p>
<p>The number of visitors to Jasper National Park, for example, fell almost 10 per cent in January, according to Parks Canada statistics.</p>
<p>Hotels across the province are also feeling the pinch, with occupancy rates for the first two months of the year down 5.8 per cent over the same period in 2008.</p>
<p>"Everybody's bracing for a difficult summer," said Dave Kaiser, president of the Alberta Hotel and Lodging Association.</p>
<p>Kaiser said the industry is responding with aggressive marketing strategies, new leisure-oriented packages and deals designed to appeal to Alberta consumers. "We know that some of the international tour numbers are down, so we have to be creative," he said.</p>
<p>The Calgary Stampede--Alberta's single biggest tourist attraction--is spending$2 million in federal funding on advertising this year to potential visitors in regions spokesman Doug Fraser dubs "rubber tire" zones.</p>
<p>"We're trying to promote the stay-cation."</p>
<p>It's a concept that appears to be catching on.</p>
<p>The Royal Tyrrell Museum says it is seeing signs that price-conscious people are interested in exploring attractions in their own backyard.</p>
<p>Attendance at the dinosaur-centric museum jumped by more than 1,100 people over Easter weekend this year relative to 2008.</p>
<p>"From a recession point of view, we're in a strong position because we're still only $30 for a family of four. It's cheaper than a movie and you can spend the whole day here," said museum spokeswoman Leanna Mohen.</p>
<p>Tour operators in Alberta's mountain parks are optimistic the province's Stay campaign will bring traffic during its busiest season of the year.</p>
<p>It's been a "challenging and difficult" year, admits Banff-Lake Louise Tourism CEO Julie Canning.</p>
<p>She said businesses are hopeful it will be a prosperous summer, but it's difficult to predict how the season will unfold because travellers are increasingly booking at the last minute.</p>
<p>"We feel very positive, but it's still early," said Canning.</p>
<p>Nadine Fletcher can relate.</p>
<p>Sheistheco-owner of Great Divide Nature Interpretation, a small business that offers guided walks and hikes in the Banff area to a mostly American clientele. Until recently, she was nervous about the approaching season.</p>
<p>She revamped her website over the winter and is relieved to see bookings start to trickle in. "Until mid-April, I would have said it's a panic situation but we're starting to receive a lot more inquiries," said Fletcher.</p>
<p>Alberta's tourism industry has other reasons for optimism.</p>
<p>In February, the number of U. S. travellers entering the province by air rose by 1.4 per cent--a positive sign when you compare it to a national decline of more than 10 per cent.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the federal government pledged to freeze entry fees into national parks and historic sites to ensure they remain affordable.</p>
<p>Not only has Dutch airline KLM recently launched service into Calgary, but early figures from a new provincial online camping reservation system suggest about 23 per cent of traffic to the site is international.</p>
<p>And beginning today, Calgary plays host to Rendez-vous Canada, an annual three-day event that typically results in $350 million in deals from major foreign tourism buyers interested in sending travellers to Canada.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Alberta mask maker gears up; PriMED's Chinese plant can't match flu demand</b>
</div><div>David Finlayson   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>571 words</div><div>11 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>M edical-supplies manufacturer priMED is turning away desperate requests for masks because its Chinese plant can't keep up with the demand sparked by the H1N1 flu crisis.</p>
<p>The Edmonton company's facility at Liyang, two hours west of Shanghai, is running 24 hours a day supplying the extra orders from its regular customers, chairman Chris Thompson said last week.</p>
<p>"We're getting lots of calls from RCMP detachments and school districts, but we can't supply them because of existing contracts and customers. It's really unfortunate because you can hear the desperation in their voices."</p>
<p>With demand up 50 per cent, the biggest problem for priMED is getting more raw material for the almost half a million masks a day the plant pumps out, Thompson said.</p>
<p>CEO David Welsh left for China Wednesday to try to secure more of the polypropylene-based material from suppliers--especially the critical middle layer of three used in the masks.</p>
<p>Many of the masks available are simple one-piece with ear loops, while priMED's have three layers that filter bacteria and particles yet allow comfortable breathing.</p>
<p>"The real magic is in the middle layer," Thompson said. "It filters out particles continuously but you can still breathe, and it's that material that's harder to get."</p>
<p>While business dealings in China have improved in recent years, it's still quite unpredictable, said Thompson, who lived there for several years before starting the company in 1995.</p>
<p>You can be promised 15 metric tonnes of product, only to be told later you've been bumped. And the government can step in and take away supply at any time.</p>
<p>Ideally, priMED would open its own raw materials plant, but it's too costly right now, he said.</p>
<p>Welsh will spend at least two weeks doing the rounds and schmoozing with suppliers, while Thompson assures regular customers it won't raise prices.</p>
<p>In fact, priMED makes less money during issues such as SARS, Avian Flu and H1N1, because input and overtime costs go up, he said.</p>
<p>"We're loath to raise our prices because it looks like we're taking advantage of the situation. We do get some back in volume, but the unit profit decreases."</p>
<p>Thompson is also urging customers not play on people's fears and hoard supplies to make extra profit. During the SARS crisis 10-cent masks were selling for $5 at Vancouver International Airport, he said.</p>
<p>It's such a big issue the federal government should look at how supplies can be co-ordinated nationally, and perhaps with the U. S., Thompson said.</p>
<p>The company has just begun a plant expansion that will double the number of employees to 1,000. They were planning it long before the current flu outbreak because business is so good, he said.</p>
<p>It has annual sales of about $30 million from masks, medical exam gloves, caps, hospital gowns and other supplies.</p>

<p>Nineteen more cases of influenza caused by the H1N1 virus were confirmed Saturday, said Roy Wadea of the BC Centre for Disease Control. This brings to 79 the total number of confirmed cases in B.C.</p>
<p>The recent spike is not a cause for alarm, according to the BC Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>"It's part of the pattern we expected to unfold," said Wadea. "Fortunately the persons coming down with this are experiencing only seasonal flu symptoms."</p>
<p>Although one patient with influenza caused by the H1N1 virus was hospitalized for observation overnight, none of the cases thus far in B.C. have been severe.</p>
<p>Wadea said health authorities have been following clusters as they occur in B.C. The mild nature of the illness means it may no longer be necessary to test everyone with flu symptoms.</p>
<p>"If you are in a school cluster, for example, and know that several kids have come down with it ... it might not be necessary to test every single person that has symptoms, just isolate them and take care of them."</p>
<p>Wadea said B.C. labs are still getting hundreds of samples a day to test. If the pattern of the virus were to change, or a more severe case were to appear, health authorities would recommend testing any mild flu that appeared.</p>
<p>The good news, said Wadea, is that "the public health system is working, and the surveillance systems are working, and doing what they are meant to do."</p>
<p>Wadea said the public and health authorities must "continue to be mindful of this for several months as we head into the fall season."</p>
<p>Health authorities will be watching as the fall influenza season hits, monitoring to see if the virus comes back, and if it does, whether it will be more or less virulent.</p>
<p>"The few people in the United States that have died all seemed to have had underlying conditions." Wadea said. "We do want to remind public health and the public that those with underlying conditions should take extra precautions."</p>

<p>Re: "Laughing in the face of swine flu" (The Gazette, May 5).</p>
<p>I'm certainly not opposed to infusing some humour into even somewhat dire situations, so long as the seriousness of the issue is not completely negated by ridicule. But, as a supplier to healthcare and cleaning professionals, I believe it's important to note the difference between being a "germaphobe" and doing our part in the fight against influenza pandemics.</p>
<p>Health authorities agree that proper and regular hand-washing or use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is the single most effective way to avoid spreading influenza. By doing so, you are protecting yourself and others.</p>
<p>The "hysterical" process of using a paper towel to turn off the faucet and open the washroom door is the preferred technique to avoid picking up the same germs you just washed away. Singing Happy Birthday aloud twice while washing your hands, is, however, not necessary. O Canada will work just as well, and you won't be criticized by any patriotic journalists, though you might frustrate anyone still sitting in the stalls.</p>

<p>HOG FUTURES</p>
<p>What do you do when you're branded, and you know you're a hog? There's no solid proof the poor porkers are the cause of swine flu but that hasn't stopped governments from banning imports and, in at least one country, culling herds. A rasher decision couldn't have been made, cried producers, as the bacon bits of the future crumbled in value.</p>
<p>Friday close: 68.5 cents US, up 2.93 cents US for the week (Chicago Mercantile Exchange)</p>
<p>HERITAGE OIL LIMITED</p>
<p>Thank goodness Gary Bettman isn't in charge of the oil business. If he was, everyone would be drilling, futilely, in the deserts of Arizona. But he's not, and that's good news for Heritage Oil. The Calgary-based</p>
<p>concern announced Wednesday that a single well drilled in Iraq had uncovered a pool containing up to four billion barrels of oil.</p>
<p>Friday close: $10.89, up $3.39 for the week (TSX.)</p>
<p><span class="companylink">FIRST QUANTUM MINERALS LTD</span>.</p>
<p>A quick review of the TSX so far this year shows that metal miners, and particularly copper players, were the place to be. Of the exchange's 10 top performers, nine were miners, and the best was First Quantum, up 209 per cent. Which is all fine and dandy, as long as the downturn left you any money to invest.</p>
<p>Friday close: $54.49, up $6.47 for the week (TSX.)</p>
<p><span class="companylink">ESTEE LAUDER COMPANIES INC</span>.</p>
<p>At first blush, <span class="companylink">Estée Lauder</span>'s third-quarter numbers looked like they deserved a lashing. But like most other things these days, being not as bad as expected was enough to give its shares a lift, even though the cosmetics maker warned the future may not be blemish-free. Is that enough to build a foundation on?</p>
<p>Friday close: $33.90 US, up $2.77 US for the week (NYSE.)</p>
<p>DENNY'S CORP.</p>
<p>One Grand Slam breakfast at Denny's is enough to feed a family of four. That's old news for hard-boiled investors though, who sold off shares in the restaurant chain after its earnings were flat as a pancake. With all these other green shoots popping up, why waffle?</p>
<p>Friday close: $2.52 US, down 24 cents US for the week (Nasdaq.)</p>

<p>Re: "Flu could infect two billion: WHO; Two children from Central Alberta who didn't travel to Mexico among province's three new cases," The Journal, May 8.</p>
<p>By hyping the H1N1 flu outbreak, I wonder if the World Health Organization (WHO) is spreading unnecessary fear. This virus has proven no more deadly then normal flu strains; yet the WHO continues to preach doom and gloom. It also has used comparisons with the deadly Spanish flu which killed millions.</p>
<p>Now, the WHO warns about the dangers of eating meat from pigs infected with the H1N1 virus. Surely such meat would not enter the food system in the first place.</p>
<p>The WHO should get back to its mandate of providing timely and accurate information, and stop fearmongering.</p>

<p>Swine flu, or H1N1, is a global sickness, but as of May 1, only 257 cases had been reported worldwide.</p>
<p>AIDS claims one life each minute in Africa. A piece of ice the size of New York, which broke off the ice shelf in Antarctica on Tuesday, has the potential to affect the global climate. Yet everyone is so caught up in worrying about swine flu they are not paying attention to the things that are really a problem.</p>
<p>Everything around us is affecting us, but we let one thing scare us. Our teacher says, "The fear of the swine flu is more contagious than the sickness. We do, however, feel bad for those who lost loved ones; these deaths do not outweigh those by pneumonia or cancer."</p>
<p>People are always using things to take away age, and they think of age and death as their enemy. Life is precious, and it comes with attachments.</p>

<p>Why do your writers keep referring to the H1N1 flu as the "swine flu?"</p>
<p>This is causing much harm to our pork industry, and I would think that responsible journalists would support Canadian industries. The media have done more harm than good with their reporting of this flu.</p>

<p>How horribly unfair! The world takes exception to our sick swine, our diseased cattle, our poison oilsands, our faulty forestry practices and dismal environmental performance. Surely the world must be wrong.</p>
<p>We can rest assured because our provincial government tells us that the world is confused, protectionist, misinformed and guilty of knee-jerk reactions, and the provincial government is forever right.</p>

<p>Re: "Chinese officials get smoke quota to help economy," The Journal, May 5.</p>
<p>Included in China's precautionary measures against H1N1 flu virus pandemic, was a ban on the import of Canadian pork after it was determined that a herd of pigs in central Alberta had become infected with the virus. Presumably, China was concerned for public health.</p>
<p>Consequently, it was mind-boggling to read that the Chinese have been ordered to smoke nearly a quarter of a million packs of cigarettes to boost the local economy during the global financial crisis. Officials who fail to meet their targets or are caught smoking the wrong brand will be fined.</p>
<p>This takes protectionism and hypocrisy to a whole new level.</p>
