</p>
<p>How exactly did Ed Stelmach cause the swine flu outbreak? He didn't, of course, but to many in the oilpatch, Alberta's premier is the primary cause of everything wrong in the world. This is unfair because the collapse in energy prices and capital markets is global.</p>
<p>But it's not unfair to observe the huge void between the captains of Alberta's most important industry and the Tory party since Stelmach became leader. Who speaks for the oilpatch in the legislature? What MLA is standing up and demanding help for the tens of thousands of unemployed oil workers and the economic carnage many smaller companies are experiencing? No MLA is even asking, let alone answering. This conspicuous silence is of enormous benefit to the Wildrose Alliance Party.</p>
<p>The Conservatives started this mess with the 2007 royalty review followed by the New Royalty Framework. Lease agreements upon which hundreds of billions of investment dollars were based were abrogated without compensation, destroying Alberta's credibility and reputation. Damage done, the royalty reduction and drilling credit Band-Aids that followed made the "simplified" royalty system excruciatingly complex. There is an undeniable anti-Calgary bias among senior Tories from northern Alberta.</p>
<p>The Liberals under new leader David Swann have been busy making friendly with the oil industry. But forgotten is the pressure predecessor Kevin Taft put on Ralph Klein's government to collect more royalties when oil prices were rising. The party is clever enough to detect and hopefully exploit oilpatch alienation. But Swann's mission is to make Alberta greener. How he will make this politically attractive to the industry is unclear.</p>
<p>When NDP Leader Brian Mason does say anything about the oil industry, it's usually about how Albertans are getting screwed compared to Norway or Alaska. Mason and the NDP inhabit a socialist utopia where everyone deserves a government-funded education and free health. But the party remains a fringe movement because it's unable to explain how to have wealth to redistribute without industrial activity.</p>
<p>And Wildrose Alliance? Party Leader Paul Hinman lost the party's only seat in last year's election, so it has no voice in the legislature. Regardless, it's Wildrose Alliance that is getting the oil industry's attention. An event at Calgary's Petroleum Club last month attracted more than 200 executives, and managers then raised thousands when hard hats were passed around the room. Combined with Hinman's announcement that he will step down at the June convention to allow the best possible leader to step forward, pundits have writ-ten more about Wildrose Alliance in the past month than the past year.</p>
<p>Supporting a political party with no elected members, some strange policies and an organization still under construction is hardly instant gratification. But for 18 months industry leaders have been trying to persuade the Tories to change direction on energy policy. Traditional lobbying has been futile. Meetings with ministers and backbenchers about how the government is mismanaging the oil and gas business all end the same way. Tories listen politely. Some even acknowledge there's a problem, but nobody publicly dares challenge big Ed.</p>
<p>So out of necessity, Alberta's oil industry is taking a hard look at a different approach--a new political party. To his credit, Hinman was the only MLA who declared Stelmach's royalty review a mistake from the day it was announced.</p>
<p>Alberta's budget deficit is so enormous that future royalty reductions could be impossible. Therefore, more oil people are concluding that none of the three parties in the legislature offer solutions. Wildrose Alliance is the only answer.</p>
<p>Across Canada every major industry--automotive, agriculture, forestry, fishery, manufacturing--has at least one vocal advocate in government. During tough times somebody says something. Absolute indifference is forcing the battered oil industry to create a completely new voice.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Survivor watched patients dying</b>
</div><div>Philip Sherwell Moises Bonilla   </div>
<div>The Telegraph</div>
<div>834 words</div><div>3 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>For Moises Bonilla, watching the life of a feverish fellow patient slip away was the most depressing point of his five days in the quarantine ward.</p>
<p>Tubes had been inserted into the victim's throat in a futile effort to help her breathe and, as her body was wheeled away, he feared he too might never leave the hospital alive.</p>
<p>The jobless Mexican maintenance worker has an unprecedented</p>
<p>insight into the flu epidemic that has swept the globe, with confirmed cases in 15 countries and a warning of a possible pandemic from the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Struck down with the presumed H1N1 flu virus as the outbreak erupted in Mexico, Bonilla is the first adult survivor to describe the ordeal.</p>
<p>"When you watch someone die in front of you and you don't know if the same thing might await you, it's a shocking experience,"he told The Telegraph from his flat in the Mexico City borough of Iztapalapa.</p>
<p>He was released last week after treatment for flu-induced pneumonia in a local hospital where the outbreak was so bad a doctor and nurse ended up as patients.</p>
<p>Although he has not heard the test results, he is being treated with oseltamivir, the generic name for the Tamiflu antivirals that have been deployed against the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Bonilla started to feel ill April 22 with a headache, running nose and sore throat.</p>
<p>"By the next day, I felt so bad that I thought my lungs were going to burst and my throat was closing up," he said.</p>
<p>That evening, he was watching the television news when the first reports emerged that a new mutant flu virus had been identified in Mexico. Bonilla rushed to hospital and was put into the emergency ward.</p>
<p>As other victims arrived, they were placed in seclusion and, on the second day, he saw the 39-year-old woman lose her fight for life.</p>
<p>Bonilla was treated at first with antibiotics, but improved dramatically when he was given oseltamivir.Cut off from the outside world, he had no idea he was at the centre of a</p>
<p>when you watch some-body die and . . . the same thing might await you, it's a shocking experience</p>
<p>flu outbreak that was making news worldwide.</p>
<p>But his wife, Blanca Estella Arcos, knew the danger her husband faced.She spent those five days at the hospital.</p>
<p>"Everyone was talking about this killer flu and an epidemic, so it was a terrifying and very anxious time to have my husband in there at death's door," she said, wiping away tears.</p>
<p>Bonilla is recuperating in the apartment where he lives with his wife, his daughters, aged 21 and 17, and granddaughters of three years and six months. To his relief, none have shown any flu symptoms, although his grandchildren are staying with relatives as a precaution.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old is a healthy, strong man--the classic pro-file for victims of the flu which, like the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, has been affecting people in the prime of life.</p>
<p>He has no doubt what brought him close to death. "I'm sure it was swine flu (H1N1). And if anybody has any doubt about how serious that is, I can tell you it's very real, awful and very dangerous."</p>
<p>Yet, some Mexicans have reacted angrily to being identified with the virus, feeling it will stain their name and make them pariahs. Such is the case with the family of Gerardo Leyva, a 39-year old craftsman from the village of Xonocatlan. He fell sick in the second week of last month and died from influenza-induced pneumonia April 20, when Mexicans had still heard nothing about swine flu.</p>
<p>But after news of the mutant virus made international head-lines three days later, his family was horrified to discover Leyva was on the government list of presumed victims.</p>
<p>Soon television crews and re-porters from across the world were driving down their dusty street asking about their connection to a global outbreak.</p>
<p>"It was so ugly. First we had gone through this tragedy in the family," said his niece, Yazmin Cortes. "Then they were saying he was spreading this disease."</p>
<p>But the truth about Leyva's death will almost certainly never be known.He was buried before Mexico had identified that the H1N1 virus was seeping through its streets.</p>
<p>Jose Cordova, the health secretary, said the corpses of such victims were being left to rest as they offered few medical clues. "There is no use exhuming corpses of people that have died in this way, because they will be contaminated with bacteria. In fact, for the tests to be useful they have to be taken in the first days of the illness."</p>
<p>By Saturday, the lab in Mexico had certified a definite 16 H1N1 deaths and 397 people ill with the virus, but staff had many more samples to test.</p>

<p>With nothing more than his bare hands, trash collector Felipe Reyes sifts through household waste in the back of a garbage truck, including kitchen scraps and soiled toilet paper, six days a week.</p>
<p>He searches for valuables and recyclables that can be resold. And he hardly ever falls ill, Reyes boasts.</p>
<p>But he recently started wearing a mask to avoid catching H1N1 flu, which he considers far more dangerous than anything lurking in the tons of trash his truck hauls off to an overflowing landfill run by the Mafia.</p>
<p>"We have more defences against what's in here than the flu,"he said after removing his mask to puff on a cigarette.</p>
<p>"The flu rather scares me." The flu outbreak has forced</p>
<p>authorities in this city of 20 million to cancel classes, limit restaurants to offering just takeout service, and urge all non-essential businesses to stay closed until Wednesday.</p>

</p>
<p>A central Alberta hog farm is under quarantine after pigs caught the same swine flu strain that's sickened hundreds of people worldwide -- news that some hog producers fear will add yet another shock to the already troubled pork industry in this province.</p>
<p>The pigs were exposed to the virus after a worker in the family-run farm recently returned from Mexico with flu symptoms, in what's believed to be the first time the new H1N1 influenza A strain has been found in pigs, provincial and federal authorities announced Saturday.</p>
<p>Officials stressed the outbreak in the herd of 2,200 has been contained, and assured the public that the country's food supply is safe and that there is no risk of contracting the illness by eating pork.</p>
<p>"It is important to remember there is no evidence the virus can be transmitted through eating pork,"said provincial Agriculture Minister George Groeneveld in a news conference Saturday.</p>
<p>"There is no risk to our food supply."</p>
<p>In Ottawa, federal officials said more than 200 infected pigs are recovering and no other farms in the area are showing signs of the outbreak.</p>
<p>"The chance these pigs could transfer the virus to a person is remote. Nevertheless, we are following an appropriately measured approach,"Dr. Brian Evans, executive vice-president of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Canada's chief veterinary officer, told reporters.</p>
<p>Flu Update</p>
<p>DEVELOPMENTS - Seven more cases reported in Alberta on Saturday, including one new case in Calgary.</p>
<p>Virus hits 18 countries with Costa Rica, Italy and Ireland reporting cases Saturday. - The United States confirms 160 cases in 21 states. - World Health Organization expected to raise pandemic alert to highest level.</p>
<p>The news came as Alberta Health confirmed seven new human cases of the virus Saturday: one in Calgary, four in Edmonton and two in north-ern Alberta, all reporting mild symptoms. The total number of Canadians infected with the virus rose to 85 on Saturday, including 17 new cases in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>In Alberta, pork producers grimly greeted reports the virus had spread to pigs, but they emphasized their product is safe and urged the public not to turn away from pork.</p>
<p>News of the H1N1 virus found in pigs in central Alberta is yet another "shock" for an industry that has been decimated in recent years, said Jurgen Preugschas, who owns a hog operation in Mayerthorpe and is president of the Canadian Pork Council.</p>
<p>He said a slumping American dollar, combined with soaring feed prices last year, high labour and energy costs, and low pork prices, have made for a tough three years.</p>
<p>"It's been devastated," Preugschas said of the Alberta pork industry.</p>
<p>"It's been devastated by many different shocks and this is just the latest in a series of shocks," he said of H1N1. "Our producers actually can't handle much more of this."</p>
<p>Authorities are releasing few details about the family-run farm, including specifics on its location.</p>
<p>According to chief provincial veterinarian Dr. Gerald Hauer, the worker returned from Mexico on April 12.Two days later, the man was back working in the barn.</p>
<p>On April 28,officials were notified the central Alberta herd wasshowingflu-likesymptoms. The farm was immediately quarantined and samples were sent to the National Centre for Foreign Diseases for analysis, said Hauer.</p>
<p>Those results came back positive for the new H1N1 strain, Hauer said.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said human viruses can be spread to pigs, which would be expected to occur with a new human virus. But if the virus is passed back from pigs to humans, that could lead to the swapping of genes and yet another unique flu virus.</p>
<p>Tests are ongoing to confirm the diagnosis by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, the agency leading the investigation.</p>
<p>"This is obviously a difficult situation for the producer and the workers in this particular operation,"Groeneveld said.</p>
<p>One producer hopes the H1N1 discovery will have only a small impact on the industry. But Glenn van Dijken still worries fear, and not fact, will affect consumer choices.</p>
<p>"It always concerns us be-cause even though we know we can't transmit the virus by eating pork, the people, they run into a fear factor and without justification they'll back away from certain products," said van Dijken, who is chairman of the board of directors of the Western Hog Exchange.</p>
<p>The dean of veterinary medicine at the University of Calgary said the news is significant, but noted the risk of humans contracting the virus back from pigs is low in Canada because swine are raised in biosecure units and don't tend to live near people.</p>
<p>"Compared to the risk of catching it from another individual . . . it's just not highly significant," Alastair Cribb said.</p>
<p>The president of the Alberta Pork Congress said news of an H1N1 infection at an Alberta farm is "definitely a big hit."</p>
<p>Pork producers had already been battling misconceptions even before news came the virus had been found in a central Alberta pork farm.</p>
<p>"The big concern for the industry is the perception that is out there that people are getting sick from eating pork," said Jason Lenz, who also operates a pork farm at Bentley. "That's not the case at all, it's never been the case. For our industry and the product we're selling, that is not a good perception to have."</p>
<p>According to Hauer, the infected farm is a "normal commercial hog operation." The herd had a history of other respiratory tract infections, he said, symptoms that aren't "uncommon" on Alberta farms.</p>
<p>Biosecurity measures were in place on the farm, Hauer said. The farm is under quarantine to prevent the spread of the virus and no other hog herds in the area have shown signs of the flu, he said.</p>
<p>On April 24, authorities is-sued bulletins to pork producers asking them to take several biosecurity precautions against the flu, including reporting sick animals and avoiding unnecessary visitors to barns, particularly those who recently travelled to affected areas.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time strains of swine influenza have affected pigs in the province, Hauer said, although this particular strain is new. "To our knowledge, this is the first time it's been found in pigs," he said.</p>
<p>Hauer couldn't say exactly how many pigs on the farm have contracted the illness, but said the influenza spreads similar to the way it does in human populations.</p>
<p>"Most of the pigs will get infected in a short period of time, then it will pass quickly as well."</p>
<p>Hauer couldn't say how many people would have come in contact with the herd, but estimated the numbers would be low, considering the size of the operation.</p>
<p>Federal Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz also emphasized that Canadian pork is safe.</p>
<p>"Canada is committed to full transparency and is sharing the most current scientific information with the international community," Ritz said in a statement.</p>
<p>"We will continue to work with our trading partners to ensure that trade decisions are based on sound science."</p>
<p>He said he's spoken to his American counterparts to make them aware of the situation, and has been assured that Canadian hog producers will continue to have access to the U. S. market.</p>
<p>Groeneveld said he'll be watching the next few days how the export market reacts to the news.</p>
<p>He said a border closure would be "unwarranted."</p>
<p>"Food safety is not an issue in this case, so hopefully we'll deal with science here and not emotional issues."</p>
<p>Alberta's chief medical officer, Dr. Andre Corriveau, said the news shouldn't raise alarms about the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>"We're already watching what's going on, diagnosing people, and going about our business."</p>
<p>On Saturday, the World Health Organization said it has not seen a sustained spread of the swine flu virus outside North America, but that a pandemic was still imminent.</p>

<p>Boom! Madden's back?</p>
<p>Just when we thought he was finally gone for good, Brett Favre has asked for and received his release from the New York Jets. This has led to speculation that the veteran quarterback will wind up in Minnesota with the Vikings. In a related story, John Madden said he was just joking and isn't really retiring.</p>
<p>Summer fun</p>
<p>Three things Sean Avery and John Tortorella are planning to do together this summer:</p>
<p>3. Drop water balloons from a balcony; 2. Sword fight with hockey sticks; 1. Swap stories with reporters about former girlfriends.</p>
<p>Melt down</p>
<p>From Bill Littlejohn: "A New York City-sized chunk of ice has collapsed off of Antarctica. Meanwhile, a San Jose-sized chunk of ice has collapsed in California.''</p>
<p>Rock of ages</p>
<p>From Derek Wilken: "Chris Chelios is a finalist for the Bill Masterton trophy, which is ironic since his first trophy was the Mastodon Cup.''</p>
<p>Name calling</p>
<p>Jeff Funnekotter, on American National Hockey League commentators having trouble pronouncing Washington Capitals goalie Simeon Varlamov's name: "They're lucky Bruce Cockburn isn't strapping on the pads any time soon.''</p>
<p>Sleeping around</p>
<p>In his new book, Darryl Strawberry says he has slept with more than 1,000 women and fewer than 5,000. Nice round numbers. Just so we don't think badly of him, Strawberry said he never, ever, ever slept with more than three women at a time. I'm thinking, well, at least that is commendable.</p>
<p>Leafs fly</p>
<p>It would be remiss to not wish Toronto Maple Leafs fans a happy anniversary. It will be five years on Monday since the Buds participated in a playoff game. How time flies when you are watching mediocre hockey.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine Flu -- a Q & A on the basics</b>
</div><div>Robert S. Boyd   </div>
<div>McClatchy Newspapers</div>
<div>1077 words</div><div>3 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>E6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Here are some questions and answers about the science of swine flu -- the H1N1 virus that's sweeping the world:</p>
<p>Q: What exactly is a virus?</p>
<p>A: It's a tiny packet of only eight genes wrapped in a cloak of proteins, much smaller than a bacterium. Unlike bacteria, a virus is only half alive. It can't eat or reproduce on its own, but must take over the genetic machinery of a living cell. Most viruses are harmless; some are useful, but others, such as the flu virus, can be deadly.</p>
<p>Q: What makes this swine flu virus special?</p>
<p>A: It's a novel combination of bird, pig and human viral genes never before found in North America or elsewhere, so people have no immunity to it. It's a descendant of the H1N1 virus that killed tens of millions of people worldwide in the pandemic of 1918-1919, mixed in with recent strains of swine and bird flu viruses. The 1918 virus originated in birds and then jumped to humans. This year's virus apparently jumped from a pig to a five-year-old boy in Veracruz, Mexico, who passed it on to other humans.</p>
<p>Q: What does H1N1 stand for?</p>
<p>A: It's the initials of two sugar proteins (their scientific names are hemagglutinin and neuramidinase) that sit on the surface of the virus and do its dirty work. There are 16 types of the Rating 1protein, numbered H1 through H16, and 9 types of the- protein, numbered N1 through N9. That makes 144 possible combinations of the virus, a constantly changing challenge for prevention or treatment. A new combination, H2N2, caused a brief swine flu epidemic in 1957. An H3N2 strain was the source of another epidemic in 1968. The bird flu virus that began in Southeast Asia a decade ago and has spread throughout the Old World is an H5N1 combination.</p>
<p>Q: How does the Rating 1protein work?</p>
<p>A: The Rating 1protein looks like a little spike that fits into a notch, called a receptor, on the outside of an animal or human cell and lets the virus enter. Once inside, the virus hijacks the DNA in the cell's nucleus and uses it to make copies of itself.</p>
<p>Q: What does the- protein do?</p>
<p>A: After infection, it opens a passage in the cell wall and releases the new baby viruses, which can now invade other cells. Without the- protein, infection would be limited to the first cell, rarely enough to cause disease.</p>
<p>Q: How do medicines such as Tamiflu and Relenza work?</p>
<p>A: They block the action of the- protein so the virus can't spread. They're not vaccines to prevent an infection, but drugs to limit its impact. They should be taken as soon as possible since the virus reproduces most rapidly between 24 and 72 hours after illness begins.</p>
<p>Q: How does a new virus develop?</p>
<p>A: When the genes that govern the Rating 1and- proteins reproduce, random changes -- mutations -- can occur in their DNA. The changes gradually accumulate, ultimately producing a virus that may be more lethal or may penetrate a target cell more easily. Another possibility is gene-swapping. This can happen when a cell is infected by viruses from different creatures, say a chicken and a pig. The cell becomes a "mixing bowl," whipping up a new virus containing some chicken genes and some pig genes. In the new strain of H1N1 virus, pieces of human, bird and pig genes are all scrambled up.</p>
<p>Q: How does this H1N1 virus differ from the H1N1 that caused the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918-1919?</p>
<p>A: That virus developed various changes over the years, so it's similar but not identical to its ancestor -- like a grandson who resembles but also differs from his grandfather. So far, H1N1 is not as virulent as the previous strain, but that could change. The earlier pandemic began mildly in 1918, but returned in a devastating second wave six months later. Experts fear that could happen again. Hence they are rushing to develop a vaccine by this fall.</p>
<p>Q: How does H1N1 virus jump from animals to humans?</p>
<p>A: Usually the Rating 1protein on a pig or bird virus doesn't fit easily into the receptor of a human cell. So a person exposed to such a virus is unlikely to get infected. However, random changes may occur in the genes that control the shape of the Rating 1protein and allow the virus to pass through the cell wall. This gives rise to a new strain of H1N1 that's adapted to humans. Now the virus can pass from person to person, as is happening now. Contact with infected pigs or birds no longer is necessary.</p>
<p>Q: How does one person catch H1N1 from others?</p>
<p>A: The virus can be transmitted through the air -- by a cough or a sneeze -- or by a handshake or by touching an infected surface, such as a doorknob. The virus can live for up to two hours outside a cell. It can't be passed by eating pork.</p>
<p>Q: Why does this disease seem to be more deadly in Mexico than in the U.S. or other countries?</p>
<p>A: That may be an illusion. The first U.S. death has now occurred in Texas and more fatalities are expected. It's possible that many cases of mild disease in Mexico went undetected, making the mortality rate appear to be higher there than it does here. It's also possible that the virus strain in the U.S. differs slightly from the one in Mexico, making it less virulent.</p>
<p>Q: Why does H1N1 seem to attack healthy young adults more than sick and elderly people, who are most affected by the ordinary seasonal flu?</p>
<p>A: Young adults have a healthy immune system that launches a massive counterattack of antibodies against the flu virus. Unfortunately, the counter-attack can cause an overwhelming inflammation that damages other organs, such as the lungs. Elderly people with weaker immune systems are less likely to suffer from such harmful inflammation. Older people who were exposed to earlier flu epidemics might also have some residual immunity in their systems.</p>

</p>
<p>The coalition government in Kenya is faltering and a group of women in the African nation have proposed an innovative solution. Here it is:</p>
<p>Unless relations between the warring coalition partners improve, there will be no, er, relations at home.</p>
<p>The Women's Development Organization, a coalition of a different kind, is behind the nookie ban, and the wives of Kenya's president and prime minister are being recruited to sign on with it. That's because President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga have been testy towards each other lately, creating the sort of problems that can paralyze a government.</p>
<p>And if the Kenya's political leaders think they can do an end run of sorts around their spouses, they can forget it, reports the BBC. Kenya's prostitutes are being paid to join the week-long ban.</p>
<p>Patricia Nyaundi, executive director of the Federation of Women Lawyers, one of the no-sex campaign organizers, said she hopes it will force the squabbling sides to kiss and make up.</p>
<p>"Great decisions are made during pillow talk," she said.</p>
<p>Not tonight, dear</p>
<p>"Aussie Lizard Rolls Over to Avoid Sex"</p>
<p>-- Headline on the website for the <span class="companylink">Australian Broadcasting</span></p>
<p>Corporation over a story that might sound familiar in some households</p>
<p>Search no more</p>
<p>Never mind all those spam e-mails you receive. If you really want to increase the size of your, um, manhood, here's a way that really works.</p>
<p>A team of researchers from the University of Turin arranged for volunteers to attach weights from 1.3 to 2.6 pounds to their penises for six hours a day over a six-month period.</p>
<p>According to the British Journal of Urology, the researchers discovered penile size in the volunteers increased an average of about one inch.</p>
<p>As always, Telescope cautions that you should only attempt to duplicate these results at home with the, er, proper supervision.</p>
<p>Not amused</p>
<p>"Queen Elizabeth 'Blissfully Unaware' Of Couple Having Sex At Windsor Castle's Garden"</p>
<p>-- Headline at the All Headline News website over a story that explores different meanings for the word "blissfully"</p>
<p>Calendar sequel</p>
<p>Women who have posed naked for an artist or photographer have claimed it can be an empowering experience. Among their numbers are the original Calendar Girls, the 11 ladies from the Rylstone Women's Institute in northern England who took off their clothes for a fundraising calendar back in 1999.</p>
<p>Well, the older and more self-confident the woman, the more empowering the experience must be because 10 years later, six of the Calendar Girls are preparing to repeat the experience.</p>
<p>According to Agence France-Presse, the women from the W.I. will be stripping for another calendar to be released for 2010.</p>
<p>The group had posed for the original saucy but discreet calendar in the modest hope of raising enough money to buy a chesterfield for a hospital waiting room. Instead, they raised $3.5 million Cdn. Their story also inspired a movie starring Helen Mirren and Julie Walters, as well as a stage version that has just opened in London's West End.</p>
<p>Helpful hint</p>
<p>"According to a new survey, women say they feel more comfortable undressing in front of men than they do undressing in front of other women. They say that women are too judgmental where, of course, men are just grateful."</p>
<p>-- Jay Leno</p>
<p>Really gone fishin'</p>
<p>Well, if you're getting tired of reading about sex, there is always fishing.</p>
<p>A fisherman who was stranded on an ice floe on Wisconsin's Lake Winnebago and floating half-a-kilometre from shore refused to be rescued, reports the Bloomington-Normal Daily Pantagraph. He shouted to rescue workers that he wanted to stay awhile because the fish were biting.</p>
<p>'I can fly!'</p>
<p>In other weather-related news, a six-pound Chihuahua was picked up by a gust of wind and swept from sight, reports the Detroit News.</p>
<p>The 110-kilometre per hour gust blew Tinker Bell more than a kilometre before she was recovered by her owners, Dorothy and Lavern Utley of Rochester, Mich.</p>
<p>The little dog was located with the help of a pet psychic, said the Utleys. Tinker Bell, "just went wild," when she saw her owners.</p>
<p>All in the family</p>
<p>The endings aren't always so happy. In Derry township, Pa.,</p>
<p>Brian Shean was killed by a falling tree after he pushed his father out of its path.</p>
<p>Now, reports the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Shean's wife is suing her father-in-law for wrongful death -- even though the mishap happened in her mother's yard. Jennifer Shean says she is launching the suit in the interests of her four-year-old son.</p>
<p>In-store promotion?</p>
<p>A <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> employee in Great Falls, Mont., stole eight laptops and seven iPods from the store where he worked, then posted them for sale on an employee bulletin board, reports the Great Falls Tribune. An arrest quickly followed.</p>
<p>Divine intervention</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the world of commerce comes news of a new online video game that depicts such religious notables as Jesus Christ and the Prophet Muhammad fighting each other.</p>
<p>According to the Arizona Republic, the game's players can enlist not only Jesus or Muhammad to battle their online opponents, but Buddha, God or the Hindu deity Ganesh as well.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Saudi-based Organization of the Islamic Conference called the game "incendiary in its content" and called for it to be taken off the Internet.</p>
<p>Well, that explains it</p>
<p>"The swine flu epidemic has reached the United States. This new mutated strand of influenza starts as a normal flu, then turns people into pigs. ... The new swine flu can be spread by coughing, sneezing, or being bit by another werepig."</p>

<p>Re: "More flu cases no cause for alarm: Liepert; 'Live life normally,' urges health minister, as calls to public information line double," The Journal, May 1.</p>
<p>I was so appalled by the decisions that Health Minister Ron Liepert has been making that I Googled him to find out his educational background. Apparently, he has a high school diploma and has taken a few courses in broadcasting.</p>
<p>This man is making decisions that affect the health of all Albertans.</p>
<p>Now, he says that Albertans should live life "normally" and that school boards were premature in cancelling student trips because of an illness that is well on its way to becoming an epidemic.</p>
<p>As a registered nurse with 91/2 years of post-secondary education (a nursing diploma, a BScN degree, and work on a master's degree), I am very uncomfortable with Liepert making decisions about health-care services that affect me, considering his minimal education level, and lack of experience in the health-care field. I think other Albertans should be just as concerned.</p>
<p>As for cancelling field trips, I disagree with him.</p>
<p>The contagion period for the H1N1 virus starts at least four days before symptoms begin to appear. I would not want my child going into crowded airports, and destinations that may well have far more cases of H1N1 than we are currently aware of.</p>

</p>
<p>For one of the best-educated, tolerant and ethnically diverse jurisdictions on this continent, official Alberta has had a strange, retrograde couple of weeks recently. It's been a bit as if the province has been channelling the sensitivities of a century ago.</p>
<p>The most recent low point, of course, was last week's bizarrely tone-deaf use of the word "monkeys" by Liberal MLA Dave Taylor in a legislature heckle about the Tory caucus -- a caucus that admirably reflects Alberta's 21st-century diversity, and as a result has several members who might understandably take great personal exception to being called such a name.</p>
<p>How, one wonders, could anyone in this day and age be successful at winning votes, and yet be missing the mental software that would instinctively warn him off the use of a word with such historically hurtful, racist connotations. And yet, even the Tories have recently proved themselves capable of phase-shifting back into the past -- albeit somewhat more benignly -- with that controversial promotional video that would suggest to an outsider that all Albertans' ethnic background must be Norse.</p>
<p>Here's a couple of ideas that might keep our politicians out of trouble. First, why not try to take a closer look at the real Alberta of today before presuming to speak for all of us. All it would probably take is an occasional five minutes imagining (or even asking!) how that couple just down the street might view a matter.</p>
<p>And secondly -- and yes, we know this is a crazy suggestion for members of legislatures and parliaments -- the best way to avoid getting into trouble when calling your opponents names might be to not call them names.</p>
<p>GUERGIS HARDLY A HOUSEHOLDER NAME</p>
<p>"Politicians!" people sometimes exclaim. "What would we do without them?" And -- albeit without the irony, it seems that's exactly what folks in Ottawa have been wondering worriedly about the residents of Edmonton Strathcona -- well, at least as far as getting along without Conservative politicians is concerned.</p>
<p>The good people of the southside riding have been deprived of Tory bumf since October, having received the New Democratic variety since electing Linda Duncan in the last election. And so Helena Guergis (as it happens, wife of the riding's former MP Rahim Jaffer) has been sending out mailings to residents to keep them in the right-thinking loop.</p>
<p>Now, there are two ways to view this.</p>
<p>One, the traditional approach, is to view it as an outrageous political use of public money -- effectively forcing taxpayers to subsidize the beginning of the Tories' next local campaign, which is widely rumoured to involve Jaffer bidding to win his seat back.</p>
<p>But in fairness, Guergis's outreach to her husband's former constituents can be viewed in a more positive light. In the first place, they are getting mail from an actual cabinet minister, which is more than most Edmontonians who elected a Conservative can say. Guergis is minister of state for the status of women. And in the second place, it's distinctly possible that many Edmontonians would rather hear from the Ontario cottage-country MP occasionally than from their own champion.</p>
<p>What, to pick one at random, would the people of Edmonton East say if given a choice of correspondent in a Reform Party-style bid for direction: "Guergis or Goldring? -- Please check one."</p>
<p>BRITAIN READIES BLOW FOR BIG BROTHER</p>
<p>For over six decades, British Tories have attempted to label the Labour</p>
<p>Party as the temple of Big Brother, the incubator of the nanny state. Often, those charges have been largely groundless beyond the essential disagreements of those arguing for more or less government.</p>
<p>But Gordon Brown's shaky Labour administration has lately given opposition leader David Cameron and the Conservatives (and the equally</p>
<p>angry Liberal Democrats) some real Orwellian-style material to work with.</p>
<p>Anticipated new legislation would compel telecom companies, Internet service providers and the like to store every single communication and search made by customers for possible government scrutiny, part of a new £2 billion program. That includes logging for a time even the social networking sites such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or Twitter.</p>
<p>A previous, quite seriously entertained proposal would have established an even worse central "super database" controlled by the state, but it was dropped following howls of protest. Still, when a blogger such as Henry Porter from the (left-of-centre) Guardian quotes the (arch-rival, right-wing) Telegraph, you get a sense of how civil libertarians of all stripes are gathering together to fight the reworked intrusion designed to replace it.</p>
<p>"Your moves are monitored by your bus tickets. There are CCTV cameras on every building and computer chips on the rubbish bins and they can tell a lot by studying your rubbish. Security has got absurd."</p>
<p>Only in Britain, you say? Pity. For them.</p>
<p>SWINE FLU SPREADS LINGUISTIC VIRUS</p>
<p>Perhaps it was inevitable, given the over-the-top hysteria in some corners of the world about imported pork somehow raising the threat of swine flu. Still, it's seems a shame that amid all the legitimate and perhaps overblown worries about human health, there's still time to worry about the bad public relations for pigs, and to give priority to renaming the infection. For one thing, if the name hadn't become an issue, Stephen Harper would never have blundered on his unfortunate solution ... "Mexican flu"! You can just imagine the Mexicans being understanding about Harper's priorities when it comes to protecting reputations.</p>
<p>The fact is, it is "swine" flu because the particular variant of the virus is similar to one known to infect pigs, "H1N1 flu" doesn't exactly trip off the tongue, and plain old "flu" doesn't sound special enough to have pandemic alerts about. Besides, it's only a name.</p>

</p>
<p>A 2,200-head pig herd in central Alberta has been infected with swine flu, and while provincial officials say the illness poses little risk to humans, it could hurt the pork industry.</p>
<p>"Border closures are certainly unwarranted, but there have been some because we have H1N1(influenza) in Canada," George Groeneveld, Alberta's agriculture minister, said Saturday.</p>
<p>"We'll see what transpires. (Federal Agriculture Minister Gerry) Ritz has talked to some of our American counterparts and they have no problems, at this point, with the export of our pork." There's no evidence the flu virus can be transmitted by eating pork, Groeneveld told a news conference.</p>
<p>"Pork is safe to eat. There's no risk to our food supply," he said. "We hope we'll deal with science and not emotions here." The information came out as officials confirmed the first four cases of swine flu in Edmonton along with three other new Alberta cases.</p>
<p>Two women, one man and a girl in Edmonton were infected and are recovering at home, bringing total numbers to 15 in Alberta and 85 across the country.</p>
<p>The pigs were exposed to the virus by a worker who had flu symptoms after returning from Mexico on April 12. Two weeks later, the pigs also started to show symptoms, including sneezing, coughing and fatigue.</p>
<p>The illness was reported to agriculture officials and the farm was quarantined last Tuesday.</p>
<p>This is the first time this particular flu virus has been transmitted from humans to pigs.</p>
<p>Although this flu is typically associated with pigs, it's not believed the current strain originated with the animals.</p>
<p>Public health officials said the development has no consequences for humans.</p>
<p>"From a human health perspective, it's just an anecdote. We were already dealing with this issue in our population," said Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency, which is leading the investigation into the pig herd infection, said 220 pigs at the unidentified farm were infected.</p>
<p>The pigs and the farm worker are recovering and there have been no other suspected cases of the virus in pigs.</p>
<p>It's not uncommon for influenza strains to pass through pig populations, said Alberta's chief provincial veterinarian, Dr. Gerald Hauer.</p>
<p>Typically, the ailment goes away on its own within a week.</p>
<p>"From the pork producers' point of view, this is just run-of-the-mill flu. You prefer not to have it, you weather the storm," he said. "But it's not a huge, big deal." What makes this strain unusual is the potential implication for human health, Hauer said.</p>
<p>Officials want to prevent any chance the virus could pass from pigs back to humans.</p>
<p>Alberta pork producers were warned April 24 to be extra vigilant about restricting access to pigs by people who have returned from Mexico and to report any signs of problems to veterinarians and agriculture officials.</p>
<p>Thorough hand-washing with soap and water is one of the best ways to prevent infection, but that hasn't stopped Edmonton residents from taking their own precautions.</p>
<p>Jasbir Bhui, a pharmacist with a <span class="companylink">Medicine Shoppe</span> in Mill Woods, said he's had people coming into his store since Tuesday looking to buy surgical masks.</p>
<p>"We usually only carry one or two of them, and those went away pretty fast," Bhui said. He said he has more on back order.</p>
<p>If customers insist they need a mask, Bhui suggests trying <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>. However, the masks aren't necessary, he said.</p>
<p>"I think people are overreacting, and I tell them that. It is a flu and I tell people that with every flu there are a certain amount of cases that go on across the world. Even with the normal flu there are about 4,000 people in Canada who die each year," he said.</p>
<p>"Yes, there's a risk, but it's not a major risk. There may be a pandemic and in a month I'll turn out to be wrong, but that's my personal opinion." With files from Laura Drake and Canwest News Service azabjek@thejournal.canwest.com</p>

<p>As the intense public curiosity about swine flu makes plain, it's easy to become fascinated to the point of obsession with new diseases. Michel Kazatchkine knows that feeling well. As an immunologist in Paris in 1983, he treated patients returning from Africa with unexplained symptoms. By 1985, he had opened an AIDS clinic.</p>
<p>"For a physician, a new disease, it's a very strange feeling. Of course it comes as a threat, and then you want to understand. There's nothing that is more frustrating for a physician than not understanding, because not understanding means not helping. The first years, the '80s, were years of total frustration, of death."</p>
<p>These days, he has new frustrations. He is now the executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. Today, he's frustrated because the Global Fund is facing a funding shortfall of more than $4 billion.</p>
<p>He's also frustrated because so many people -- including Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Pope Benedict XVI -- continue to ignore the evidence about how AIDS is spread and how it can be prevented.</p>
<p>Kazatchkine made his first official visit to Canada in April. He met with Canada's international co-operation minister, Bev Oda, who used the occasion to make a saccharine statement about Canada's contributions to the Global Fund. "I am proud that this government continues to be a worldwide leader in the effort to combat widespread and deadly diseases," the minister said.</p>
<p>Canada was, as Oda said, "instrumental" in the creation of the Global Fund in 2002. The fund is one of the most effective tools ever created for combatting infectious disease. It's evidence-based: projects that will work get funded, and projects that won't, don't.</p>
<p>Canada likes supporting the advancement of medical science in noble causes. Except when it doesn't.</p>
<p>Oda didn't mention that a few days before their meeting, Kazatchkine made international headlines when he called for the decriminalization of drug use, and said governments should encourage harm-reduction strategies for intravenous-drug users.</p>
<p>"A repressive way of dealing with drug users is a way of facilitating the spread of the (AIDS) epidemic," Kazatchkine told The Observer. Then he said the same thing to an international conference in Bangkok. And then he came to Canada.</p>
<p>I doubt anyone knows the AIDS epidemic more intimately than Kazatchkine, who has spent the last quarter-century fighting it. If he says drug laws are facilitating the spread of AIDS, we should listen to him. (He emphasizes that he's talking about decriminalizing use, not trafficking.) If he says harm-reduction works, we should listen to him.</p>
<p>So what did this Canadian government, which is so proud of its connection to the Global Fund, do right after Kazatchkine's visit? It sent its lawyers to Vancouver to fight to shut down the safe-injection site there.</p>
<p>"I've heard about the controversies that I must say I wouldn't have expected to occur in a country like yours," Kazatchkine told me. "I find it very frustrating and disappointing that, after so many years, the area of HIV prevention where the most compelling evidence on efficacy is, is still a matter of debate and resistance."</p>
<p>He is similarly baffled by the recent statements by Pope Benedict XVI, criticizing the distribution of condoms in Africa. "I think it's an absolute scandal to say such things, and particularly scandalous to have those declarations while he was flying to Africa, and to Cameroon, which is a country I know well. It is a country with a generalized epidemic, and I cannot understand that any type of ideological thinking should prevail over reducing harm and having public health, the health of the people, as the number one priority."</p>
<p>It's heartbreaking to watch political and religious leaders squander the opportunities provided by 25 years of hard work on the AIDS front. There has never been a better chance to halt the spread of HIV than right now. After the difficult years of the 1980s, solutions began to appear in the mid-1990s. Drugs were available, and an international consensus developed about the need for widescale treatment and prevention. But then, for several years, the effort stalled again.</p>
<p>It has only been in the last few years, since the creation of the Global Fund and other creative initiatives, that there's been real reason for hope and even excitement. More than four million people in the developing world are now receiving antiretroviral treatment, two million of them through programs supported by the Global Fund. The life expectancy of an HIV-positive person has skyrocketed, making it likely that a 20-year-old Canadian on antiretroviral treatment will live into his or her 60s. Unless that HIV-positive person is an intravenous-drug user, which reduces the life expectancy of a person on antiretroviral treatment by about 12 years. And as Kazatchkine points out, drug users might not start antiretrovirals in the first place, because they're hiding from the system.</p>
<p>Canada's government cannot in good conscience continue to congratulate itself on fighting AIDS, so long as it refuses to hold a frank conversation about its drug laws.</p>

</p>
<p>cover story</p>
<p>From newscasts and talk shows to chats around the water cooler, the latest deadly flu has made a lot of people frightened. Should they be?</p>
<p>Philip Alcabes, an epidemiologist and associate professor of public health at Hunter College in New York, insists not. As Alcabes argues in Dread, his just published history of epidemics, such fears are often grossly exaggerated.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Star, Alcabes discussed the current situation, its antecedents, and the hidden agendas that are often at play. This is an edited version of that conversation.</p>
<p>Is there anything unexpected in how the current flu has spread or how the authorities have reacted?</p>
<p>This is very mild. If this were a mid-winter flu outbreak, we wouldn't even notice it.</p>
<p>It came out of season, and much was made of two small facts. One was that the virus in question seemed to be a recombinant of swine and avian viruses as well as human flu viruses. I don't find that very remarkable but some people did, and maybe scary, like something's jumped on us from pigs.</p>
<p>The other fact was that so many of the deaths in Mexico were among young adults. The ingredients were all there for us to get extremely worried very fast.</p>
<p>The current swine flu, or I guess we have to call it H1N1 flu, is a public-health problem. It deserves the attention it's getting from public-health authorities. But I also think the response has been greatly exaggerated, the response on the part of some people.</p>
<p>One of your core arguments is that standard public-health measures, such as isolating the afflicted and preventing people from gathering in large groups, have done a pretty good job at containing outbreaks since the Spanish Flu in 1918. Is this the best we should ever expect to do?</p>
<p>I suspect that one day we'll do even better. We need to think more holistically about the links between humans, animals, climate, the environment. I think public health will start to do that and get even better at understanding flu, and we will control it better.</p>
<p>But we're pretty good right now. SARS is actually a great example. I know it was scary in Toronto, but it was a great example of the success of standard public-health measures. It moved around the world very quickly at first, but each of the outbreaks was contained rather expeditiously. Even in Toronto, I think there were only two or maybe three chains of transmission and then the outbreak was shut down.</p>
<p>Still, 44 people died in Greater Toronto.</p>
<p>That was sad. It would have been great if it didn't happen at all, but it's a real tribute to the success of public-containment measures. I think we're seeing that with this flu outbreak. The public-health authorities in the U.S. and Canada have done a really good job of being fact-based, cautious, circumspect and clear in their communications with the public about what's known and what's not known and what needs to be done.</p>
<p>You note in the book that we still don't know exactly why plague disappeared. Yet we still tend to think that any disease can be wiped out if we throw enough science at it.</p>
<p>It's a great point. We actually don't know why some of the great disease disasters of all time began or why they ended. We don't know why the Black Death started when it did, and we don't know why it ended when it did. Having had a sort of three-century run, plague just deserted the scene.</p>
<p>Technically, an epidemic occurs when there are more cases of a disease in a certain place at a certain time than would otherwise be expected. But in public discourse, we use that term for everything from the Black Death to restless leg syndrome. Do we need to come up with a clearer, widely accepted definition?</p>
<p>The definition you gave is the one I require my students to know. But there's not going to be a single definition that will always work, because the epidemic isn't just facts, the incidence of the disease or mortality rate, or how fast it's spreading.</p>
<p>The epidemic is a story. We tell ourselves what's going on in a way that's loaded with our fears, hopes and expectations. Roughly 40,000 people die in vehicle accidents (in the U.S.) every year, and we don't talk about that as an epidemic.</p>
<p>Sociologists say we're especially bad at dealing with risks that have a low probability of occurring but a high magnitude of harm if they do occur. Doesn't that mean we'll always be prone to hysteria?</p>
<p>Maybe so. It's true that we respond to risk in ways that are freighted with our anxieties and fears.</p>
<p>Whether or not we can corral our fears, we can restrain ourselves from responding in ways that vilify certain groups of people or blame epidemics on certain people's behaviours.</p>
<p>In the past, people talked about epidemics as if sickness is God's punishment for moral failing. So Black Death gets blamed on the Jews, polio on Italians and cholera on the Irish. At first, AIDS was even called the "gay plague." There's always a political or moral agenda at work.</p>
<p>I think we do it because of fear. We have worries about the way we live our lives, about the way we've made our society. Sometimes disease events seem to validate those worries.</p>
<p>That accounted for a lot of what happened when AIDS came. People thought that the sexual revolution was a kind of moral or spiritual disaster for society, or thought we were too accepting of homosexuality. (Evangelist) Pat Buchanan (said) the sexual revolution has come to devour its children.</p>
<p>Writer Susan Sontag talked about AIDS being "the disease most fraught with meaning," one she hoped would eventually become "just a disease." Are we there yet?</p>
<p>Certainly with AIDS we're not there yet, and it seems like we don't always want to be. We don't want everything to just be ordinary. With AIDS, it's a really complicated question because the impetus to maintain the extraordinariness of AIDS is to keep the funding going. If you're in the AIDS industry, you want to continue to get funding for treatment and prevention.</p>
<p>I don't want to vilify those researchers. We require that scientists justify their research on the basis of some imagined future. They're necessarily drawn into making claims about what might happen in the future in order to keep the funding flowing.</p>
<p>But epidemics, or fear of them, have been used as a tool to make important social reforms, such as alleviating poverty or improving sanitation and water quality. Have there been any similar benefits recently?</p>
<p>I think we still do that, and it's a good thing. During the last year or so, when the health authorities had been talking about pandemic preparedness, I think they used inflammatory rhetoric to get people worked up. But, at the same time, public-health programs were being built up, and that was good. I wish we could just fortify the public-health programs without the rhetoric.</p>
<p>You're very cynical about the health-care industry, how it pushes diet and exercise programs to tackle the "epidemic" of "obesity," even though the Body Mass Index doesn't measure fitness. But surely some collateral good comes of that?</p>
<p>I think there is. Clearly, obesity is bad for some people, (but) we exaggerate the harm in order to send messages, and those messages are infused with our anxieties about modern life. Most people who have a BMI high enough to be called obese are not harmed by it. Some are, and the health-care system is challenged by that.</p>
<p>But what I find remarkable is that, in the zeal of the health-care industry to promote this campaign against obesity, there's almost no discussion of the suffering of the people who are actually fat.</p>

</p>
<p>Every Sunday, Rev. Lisa Enns-Bogoya shakes dozens, even hundreds, of hands as she talks to her parishioners leaving the morning worship service.</p>
<p>But in the face of a pandemic, the minister at Bethel Mennonite Church is wondering whether she can continue that friendly, pastoral gesture.</p>
<p>"I don't know if we would just stop that kind of practice until the crisis is over or look for some other alternative that does allow for that personal connection," she says, adding she is open to suggestions on what sort of greeting could replace a handshake.</p>
<p>That is the sort of question churches and other faith groups need to be considering in light of the spread of H1N1 flu or another widespread health emergency, says Janet Plenert of Mennonite Church Canada. The Winnipeg-based denomination has developed a website at www.churchpandemicresources.ca[http://www.churchpandemicresources.ca]. to help congregations and individuals prepare and respond to a pandemic.</p>
<p>"It's the very essence of being the church. We are trying to be God's presence in our communities," Plenert says of why Christians would respond to help others in an emergency. "We believe God would love compassionately and selflessly and reach out to those in need. And that means we need to think about the resources that would be helpful."</p>
<p>Health-care professionals have repeatedly said the best defence against the H1N1 flu is handwashing, coughing or sneezing into a tissue or sleeve, and staying home when sick. Plenert says congregations might consider taking small common-sense measures like eliminating shaking hands with the minister and passing of the peace (where congregants shake hands during a set time in the service) if the pandemic escalates to the highest level.</p>
<p>Enns-Bogoya says her church has already installed hand-sanitizer dispensers in two locations and is considering what else they could do to deal with the current situation.</p>
<p>"What structures are we going to have to change and what new structures do we have to develop? We have no doubt we are going to be looked to for help in whatever form," she says, adding the Stafford Street church's tentative emergency plan includes reaching out to people in the neighbourhood and offering assistance to the 160 seniors living in an adjacent apartment building.</p>
<p>Over at Shaarey Zedek Synagogue, emergency plans are being implemented to deal with the implications of an H1N1 flu outbreak, and a group of physicians has organized a panel discussion for Saturday, May 9, on the duties of citizens and health-care professionals during a pandemic. Jews are obligated to make their own infections known to other people, and also to manage the fears of those around the ill person, explains Rabbi Lawrence Pinsker.</p>
<p>"You have to take your neighbour's needs as seriously as your own," he says, referring to laws set out in the Torah.</p>
<p>Beyond looking after themselves, Plenert says developing a plan prepares faith groups to ask if and how they are prepared to respond if widespread quarantines are put into place and many people are confined to their homes. She wonders if Christians would be prepared to risk their lives in the service of others.</p>
<p>"Can we ask health-care professionals to work in hospitals if we aren't prepared to do this as Christians?," asks Plenert, who oversees mission work for Mennonite Church Canada.</p>
<p>"While we will take our guidance from health-care professionals and government officials, there may be a place where the church has to choose compassion over self-care."</p>
<p>Church groups and other non-governmental organizations are already essential players in responding to emergencies, says Don Timmerman, director of disaster services for the Salvation Army's Manitoba and Northwestern Ontario region.</p>
<p>"We have an agreement with the province and the city in times of emergency we will provide feeding and clothing and emotional and spiritual care," he says of the Salvation Army's current role, which recently involved making thousands of sandwiches for volunteer sandbaggers during the 2009 Red River flood.</p>
<p>Partners in Disaster, a co-operative of church groups and other agencies, are scheduled to meet with Manitoba Health officials Monday to discuss their involvement in dealing with a pandemic, says Timmerman. In addition to the Salvation Army, Partners in Disaster includes representatives from Mennonite Disaster Service, the Red Cross, St. John's Ambulance and the Christian Reformed World Relief.</p>
<p>Plenert suggests churches, denominational offices and other faith-based organizations develop emergency plans outlining how to keep a church running in times of health emergencies or natural disasters, and how church members could respond to needs in their community. That might include organizing communication networks, developing lists of volunteer drivers who could bring meals or deliver medications to seniors isolated in their homes, or even opening up a church building as an emergency kitchen or drop-in centre to the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>"What we have is information and advance thinking," she says of the website developed by emergency workers, health-care professionals and church administrators. The website was designed to be useful to people across the faith traditions, and faith groups are welcome to link to it from their own websites.</p>
<p>To heal and protect</p>
<p>Join Rabbi Lawrence Pinsker, Dr. Bonnie Cham and the physicians study group at Shaarey Zedek Synagogue for a discussion on Jewish insight into ethical behaviour during a pandemic, 9 a.m., Saturday, May 9, 561 Wellington Cres. Admission is free. Call 975-3481 to register for the lunch.</p>
<p>brenda@suderman.com</p>
<p>Pandemic</p>
<p>preparedness for congregations</p>
<p>Appoint a working group that includes the pastor or priest, a member of the worship committee, a health-care professional, custodian, a member of the finance committee and a communication or website person. This group would review resources, information and act as the contact people in case of emergency.</p>
<p>Make an emergency plan. This could include modifications to the regular business of the congregation, how to educate and train the congregation on emergency issues, lists of internal contacts and external resources to help in times of crisis.</p>
<p>Ask some questions. Some things to consider are: How would a major emergency affect the congregation, who are the vulnerable congregants, who are our neighbours, who will serve as backup to leaders and custodian if they are sick, and will we close our doors until the pandemic is over?</p>
<p>Talk to the congregation. Larger theological issues such as putting people in harm's way to care for others in need could be discussed as part of emergency planning.</p>
<p>Consider installing hand-sanitizing stations, putting up posters emphasizing the importance of handwashing and establishing regular cleaning routines of common areas before and after worship.</p>

<p>Cover: It's about time. Poor, sad, ticking-biological-clock-having Jen is finally taking matters in to her own hands and picking out a cute baby boy for photo ops, public play dates and something to talk about besides her failed love life when being interviewed. She already has a name picked out. It's Brad & Johnny Are Stupid and I Hate Them. A bit clunky, perhaps, but the little tyke will get used to it soon enough.</p>
<p>This week in poetic alliteration: While Jen is adopting, Star keeps insisting Sainted Angie is pregnant because someone saw a bump through her "frock's flowing fabric."</p>
<p>This week in theatre: Katie is taking dancing lessons so she can score a role in a Broadway musical. She has her little heart set on a part in Guys and Dolls Who Almost Look and Behave Like Real People.</p>
<p>Cover: So, this guy is married to a controlling harridan and they have a gazillion children (hint: it's not Brad and Angelina) and they also have a TV show and now he's stepping out for a bit of young. While his wife was away selling some sure-to- be-riveting book about their lives, he was observed WITHOUT HIS WEDDING RING. It's all so very, very scandalous and I really have no idea who these people are. But shame on him. Spit. Spit. Spit.</p>
<p>This week in ribs: Lindsay's life is out of control, but she has drugs to keep her thin so all is not lost.</p>
<p>This week in Miss California: Despite denials from Butterface Phelps, sources say he is indeed dating the gay-hating Carrie Prejean, who apparently is a "mean, vicious nightmare" to be around. Many happy returns to them both.</p>
<p>Cover: Some experts who aren't treating Oprah estimate that if she doesn't lose some weight she could die sooner rather than later. So, sorry, there's no story here. But I must say I'm very much in awe of the clever placement of "Deadly Swine Flu" just above the main story. Like, OMG! What if Oprah had Swine Flu? It would totally be one of her favourite things and everyone would want it.</p>
<p>This week in generous offers: Tommy has invited Katie's freshly- widowed sister and her children to move in with them. Katie's sister was, "well, yes, that sounds, erm ... really totally creepy, so I think I'm just going, erm, take my kids, change my identity, dye my hair and run to somewhere that's not your house. But thanks anyway."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>SARS epidemic forced Ontario to better prepare for crises</b>
</div><div>Tanya Talaga   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>850 words</div><div>3 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Within hours of the official opening of the Sheela Basrur Centre - the public health education centre named in honour of the late doctor who led Ontario's fight against SARS - the conference room where the party had been held was hastily cleared out and turned into an emergency operations command centre.</p>
<p>It was April 23. A new swine flu was emerging in Mexico, and Ontario was one of the first jurisdictions to recognize it and activate the provincial pandemic response.</p>
<p>It has been said Ontario learned the painful lessons of SARS well. The outbreak in 2003 left Toronto stunned: thousands of people were quarantined in their homes, 44 died, and the World Health Organization warned travellers everywhere to stay away from the city.</p>
<p>Six years later, as yet again the spectre of pandemic loomed, local officials are far better prepared.</p>
<p>"This is a multi-tasking room, just like Sheela was," says Dr. Vivek Goel, CEO of the Ontario Agency of Health Protection and Promotion, home to the Basrur Centre. "We did the presentation at 1 p.m. ... at 3 p.m. we were moving the furniture and setting up."</p>
<p>Back when SARS hit, the province was an underfunded public health wasteland. There was no overarching plan if a global infectious disease were to suddenly appear, no public health agency, and one microbiologist running a lab meant to test samples for millions of people.</p>
<p>"It was a disaster," recalls Dr. Don Low, microbiologist-in-chief at Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>This time around, Ontario experts feel ready. Goel heads Ontario's new public health agency on University Ave., which provides a similar function to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Established in 2007, the agency also runs a beefed-up provincial laboratory system led by Low. In all, the lab and agency employ 707.</p>
<p>And Ontario now has a 500-page pandemic plan with details on everything from who gets antiviral medication to how communities should set up flu centres if emergency rooms are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The planning is not overkill; it is necessary, says Low. No one knows exactly how H1N1 influenza A (as swine flu is now officially called) will develop in coming months.</p>
<p>What has been seen so far in Canada, where there are at least 85 confirmed cases, is a comparatively mild illness. None of the 14 adults diagnosed in Ontario, all recent visitors to Mexico, has needed hospitalization. All are recovering and there are still no signs of person-to-person spread of the virus.</p>
<p>In fact, the swine flu shows no signs of being as strong as the regular seasonal flu that kills 4,000 Canadians a year.</p>
<p>As the traditional winter flu season ends, this never-before-seen virus could disappear from the northern hemisphere until fall. But it could mutate over the summer and return stronger later in the year, triggering a true pandemic.</p>
<p>"It is critical we are where we are," says Low. "This isn't SARS. What was SARS - 375 cases? Big deal." (According to WHO, there were 251 SARS cases and 44 deaths in Canada.) "You can imagine if we are talking 200,000 people. ... There is no time not to be prepared."</p>
<p>SARS was the defining event that showed public health could no longer operate on a shoestring, says Low. Yes, Ontario dealt with many other public health problems before SARS - the Walkerton water crisis in 2000 and West Nile virus in 2001 - but none pointed out the lack of provincial capacity so woefully as did the SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>"The problem we were facing was not only a lack of leadership and organization, it was a lack of people," says Low. There was a lack of structure and no single person clearly in charge to make decisions.</p>
<p>"You need someone to take charge, to step back. That is what you are able to see with Vivek Goel."</p>
<p>Goel, a public health physician from the University of Toronto, is the new face at the daily provincial news conferences on swine flu.</p>
<p>His agency, which operates apart from the government, has recruited top scientists and physicians from around the world.</p>
<p>"Ontario has invested in the people to improve the response," he says. "We are definitely much more prepared."</p>
<p>In fact, when word of the new virus emerged nearly two weeks ago, Ontario, along with B.C., was the "only jurisdiction in the world that put out an alert," says Goel. The CDC in the U.S. didn't put out a press release until two days later.</p>
<p>Low's labs, too, are well staffed, employing nearly 600 people.</p>
<p>"We have recruited, just on the lab side, professionally, nine individuals, all of them, medical microbiologist, clinical PhD people, basic scientists, a mix of individuals," he says. The labs can now test hundreds of samples a day. "It is amazing to watch."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Alberta pigs quarantined after virus detected; Farmhand who travelled to Mexico apparently passed swine flu on to animals he was handling</b>
</div><div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>396 words</div><div>3 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A07</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Pigs at an Alberta farm caught the same swine flu strain that has sickened hundreds of humans around the world, federal officials said yesterday.</p>
<p>A farmhand who travelled to Mexico and fell ill upon his return apparently infected the pigs with the H1N1 influenza virus, said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>"So far, basically what we're seeing in the pig is the same strain as we see in the humans," Butler-Jones said. "The concern is that if it's circulating in a pig herd, that any other humans that come onto the farm might be exposed and be at risk."</p>
<p>This is the first time this swine flu virus has been found in pigs.</p>
<p>The farmworker returned to Canada from Mexico on April 12 and had contact with the pigs two days later. About 220 pigs in the herd of 2,200 began showing signs of the flu on April 24, said the country's top veterinary officer, Dr. Brian Evans of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.</p>
<p>All the pigs are recovering or have recovered. The farmworker has also recovered.</p>
<p>One other farmworker subsequently fell ill. It's not yet known if that person caught the swine flu.</p>
<p>Bulletins were sent to Alberta pork producers on April 24 warning them of the possible danger that swine flu could present to their herds, said Gerald Hauer, the province's chief provincial veterinarian. But by that time, the farmhand was already back on the job.</p>
<p>The farmer notified provincial officials that an unspecified number of his animals were showing flu symptoms on April 28. The barn was quarantined later that day and remains under quarantine. No other area hog barn has been affected.</p>
<p>Alberta Agriculture Minister George Groeneveld said the outbreak shouldn't affect Alberta's export markets.</p>
<p>"Border closures are certainly unwarranted," he said. "We'll see what transpires. (The Americans) at this point have no problems with the export of our pork."</p>
<p>Alberta farmers raise about 1.6 million hogs, exporting 600,000.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has insisted there is no evidence that pigs are passing the virus to humans or that eating pork products poses an infection risk.</p>

<p>MANITOBA still does not have a confirmed case of the H1N1 flu, despite an increase in the number of cases elsewhere in the country.</p>
<p>In a press release Saturday, the Office of the Chief Provincial Public Health Officer said there have been no confirmed cases of the H1N1 flu, also known as swine flu.</p>
<p>Manitobans are still being urged to stay home from work or school if they develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, aches and tiredness.</p>
<p>The office also advises Manitobans to cough and sneeze into their elbows, sleeves or tissues, and to wash their hands often with soap and water.</p>
<p>There have been no cases of the virus found in Manitoba hogs.</p>
<p>Dr. Wayne Lees, chief provincial veterinary officer, said hog operations adhere to strict bio-security protocols to isolate pigs from human diseases.</p>
<p>These protocols were breached at the Alberta operation where flu was found in pigs, Lees said, adding it's unlikely a repeat could occur in Manitoba.</p>
<p>The message has gone out to operators across the province to prevent a similar security breach from happening on a Manitoba farm, he said.</p>
<p>"We can never say never," Lees said. "No system is 100 per cent perfect. Bio-security is put in place by people and people are fallible."</p>
<p>There have been no reports of the flu virus being transmitted through properly handled and cooked pork and pork products, provincial officials said. To kill bacteria and viruses, pork should always be well-cooked to an internal temperature of 71 C, until the meat juices are clear and there is no visible pinkness.</p>

</p>
<p>Like many of you, I have been watching the developments of the H1N1 flu bug, a new strain of influenza that is among us.</p>
<p>The so-called swine flu is a bug that is only one-third piggish. Unlike our porkbelly friends, this virus sprouted wings, true to its avian nature.</p>
<p>Now it is walking, talking and riding the bus, spreading from person to person in public and private places in our communities -- that's its human profile. And in that, it is much like the typical flu viruses that plague us each flu season. Unlike those viruses, though, it appeared to look unusually deadly, especially among young adult Mexicans who were otherwise healthy, not your typical flu fatality.</p>
<p>And the world reacted accordingly. What I see, however, mostly is that there is uneven response in various countries as to the best way to contain the spread of the virus. Some countries banned pork imports despite the fact meat won't transmit the virus. Others advised against travel to Canada, at the first sign there were any cases here. A number of countries are using thermal imaging at airports, something Canada, where the virus has made landfall, thought better of.</p>
<p>Canada, one of the first countries to see cases pop up, gained good experience out of its deadly dance with SARS in the spring of 2003 and is putting that to use, judging by the advice from public health officials here, in its response to H1N1 now. It is impressive to see how the provinces and the federal government's public health agency are co-ordinating their information to the masses and everyone seems to be on the same page as to precautions.</p>
<p>I hear that donning a certified face mask for public use is inadvisable. Masks are temperamental things, they tend to slide around, if not fitted to your face properly, and not all masks are created equal -- something a visit to your local hardware aisle will reveal. You gotta get one that can catch and block the super tiny virus or you are simply steaming your spectacles for no good return. And then if you play with it, or fix it below your nose, well, why put one on? But this is all about weighing risks. I get sneezed on regularly on the bus to and from work. Dirty looks and harsh words are feeble defences against rogue body fluids. So I asked Joel Kettner, Manitoba chief medical officer of health: why not?</p>
<p>Dr. Kettner said there are three things that are considered before deciding how best to contain this bug in the public sphere -- how sick does it make people, does it travel from person to person and is it spread through "droplets" --ie. people sneezing and coughing on each other, or hands picking up the virus from door handles and other public surfaces. Like all flu bugs, H1N1 moves from person to person and it can be picked up from droplets.</p>
<p>But it is not "severe," in fact it is mild, certainly in all countries outside of Mexico. "It's not making people very sick," Dr. Kettner said. And it doesn't last very long.</p>
<p>Ergo, no need to tell people to mask up before stepping onto a bus, as it sits.</p>
<p>Then why did the global health network, through the World Health Organization, spring into pandemic preparedness and why is the alert sitting one step below the top "pandemic" level?</p>
<p>Well, seems for all our experience with epidemics (and pandemics, as there have been others since the 1918/19 Spanish flu) the criteria for detecting and reacting to a potential pandemic is still rough. Dr. Kettner said everyone figured severity would go hand in hand with a novel virus, and early reports of high fatality out of Mexico (that authorities are now rethinking in light of the better information) suggested as much.</p>
<p>It hasn't, at least not yet.</p>
<p>Swine flu has sent public health experts back to the WHO drawing board, rewriting the criteria for pandemic alerts. This scare -- which may amount to another useful dry run for the biggie -- will hone pandemic planning.</p>
<p>As for those countries I see over-reacting with stringent screening at airports, travel warnings and irrational bans, Dr. Kettner reminds us that political decisions are not always directly connected to the science of epidemiology. Fear can bugger up the best laid plans of really smart public health officials. You're not going to suppressing the very human instinct to overreact if people can't have confidence in "official" advice.</p>
<p>A little inconsistency makes it real tough for the guy on the bus to know who to trust.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON -- Kenny Barnes Jr. was behind the counter of his Afro-chic boutique on U Street in Washington in 2001 when a 17-year-old boy he knew as "Dee" Hill walked in. Hill, who had been helping Barnes with some odd jobs, sweeping up the store, that sort of thing, sat down and chatted for a quarter-hour or so.</p>
<p>Then he pulled out a gun and shot Kenny Barnes Jr. in the face.</p>
<p>The killer ran away, but there were witnesses and -- without snitching to the police, without violating the neighbourhood code of silence that is punished in its breach by death -- it soon became known around U Street that it was Dee Hill who killed Kenny Barnes, Jr.</p>
<p>The victim left a wife, four children and the broken heart of Kenny Barnes Sr., a big man, 63, with glaucoma and breathing problems, who slumps on his couch in a lime-green shirt and says to me, "I love President Obama, I think he's a brilliant, brilliant guy, but if you listen to him, he's not even talking about this issue, not even addressing it at all."</p>
<p>It was the senior Barnes who tracked down Dee Hill -- who had walked out of group home after group home, who was high on PCP when he pulled the trigger, who had killed two other people -- and got him locked away for 105 years.</p>
<p>This is, by presidential proclamation, National Crime Victims' Rights Week. "We honour crime victims by pledging to fight crime wherever it exists," Obama said the other day. But then he needed to return to the wars and the economy and the automakers and the virus that was stoking a national furnace of rational and irrational fear.</p>
<p>"I'd like to meet with Obama," Kenny Barnes went on, "and tell him that he's talking about the swine flu, but that hasn't killed anybody. This crime epidemic kills people every day. These kids are terrorists; they're terrorizing our neighbourhoods. You don't have to be an Arab to be a terrorist."</p>
<p>"Did you think that having a black man in the White House would make black men stop shooting each other?" I ask.</p>
<p>"No," he replies. "I think maybe there's some sense of pride, but stop shooting? No. You looked at my girlfriend? I'll kill you. You stepped on my shoes? I'll kill you. You walked in my neighbourhood? For that, I'll kill you.</p>
<p>"In America today, we have some of the most violent young people in the history of this country. In this city, 99.5 per cent of the killings are black on black. When a white man gets killed in the District of Columbia, it's like the wrath of God comes down. These kids know that. If you're white, you'll get robbed, but they won't kill you."</p>
<p>With the remainder of his voice that severe asthma has left him, Barnes remembers how he was coming home from graduate courses in clinical psychology when his sister called to tell him his child had been shot. The son was dead before the father reached the hospital, he tells me, and in my head I hear the old Mississippi bluesman Son House and Death Letter, perhaps the saddest song ever sung:</p>
<p>"When I got there, she was layin' on the coolin' board...</p>
<p>"I didn't know I loved her till they laid her down."</p>
<p>In his grief, Kenny Barnes Sr. founded an organization called ROOT: Reaching Out to Others Together. Last week, he received the National Service Award from the U.S. Congress for his tireless efforts to find a real-world, lasting solution to this grievous American plague. But still the black men keep dying in the Washington alleys that the tourists never see.</p>
<p>"Do you think you've ever saved a life?" I ask the father.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah," he says. "Beginning with Dee Hill. If I hadn't intervened and got him sent to jail, you know damn well he would have been killed on the streets."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Grim memories of deadly pandemic; warning: 99-year-old survivor of 1918 Spanish flu tells public to heed precautions</b>
</div><div>Robert Remington   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service; Calgary Herald</div>
<div>588 words</div><div>3 May 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>

<p>Funeral homes hired extra drivers to collect corpses. Carpenters built caskets as fast as they could. In the town of High River, Alta., an auto-repair shop was turned into a mortuary. In Edmonton, 54 bodies awaiting burial were stored in livery stable.</p>
<p>For eight-year-old Marion Taylor, it was a confusing and frightening time.</p>
<p>"I remember every detail. My brother was in a coma for 10 days. He had to be force-fed with his eyes closed," said Taylor, 99. "When I got sick, I laid in the bed with my head hanging over, dripping blood from my nose.</p>
<p>"My father came home and said, 'A whole family went today.' I wondered, 'Went where?' What did that mean? I was a kid. I found out later."</p>
<p>Taylor is a survivor of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that killed between 30,000 and 50,000 Canadians, a toll that makes the current swine flu outbreak seem insignificant.</p>
<p>Still, Taylor warns people to heed precautions of health officials. She said she fears the events of 1918, seared into her memory, could happen again. "People are so careless today," said the retired nurse at her Calgary home.</p>
<p>"Most people today say, 'Oh, I'm not going to get it.' People my age who remember it are mostly all gone. The people who came after us don't realize what can happen."</p>
<p>Taylor was living in the small Saskatchewan town of Wolseley, 100 kilometres east of Regina, when the flu hit. She recalls her classmates dying. "That was very hard for children," she said. "What do you tell them?"</p>
<p>The 1918-20 pandemic is "generally regarded as the most deadly disease event in human history," according to the World Health Organization. In its first year, the flu killed more than 40 million people -- five times the number of military deaths during the five years of the First World War.</p>
<p>Estimates of the pandemic's final death toll vary widely from 50 to 100 million deaths, or between 2.5 and five per cent of the world's population, according to WHO. Nearly 30 per cent of the world's population fell ill.</p>
<p>Another pandemic in 1957, caused by a milder virus, left two million dead globally.</p>
<p>The relatively low figures of the current outbreak of H1N1 are not being taken lightly by health officials, who are working on a vaccine -- said to be six months away -- in hopes of preventing a repeat of past pandemics.</p>
<p>According to mathematical modelling done in 2006 by the Public Health Agency of Canada, a new strain such as H1N1 could kill 10,000 to 58,000 Canadians in six to eight weeks. It could leave 4.5 million to 10.6 million too sick to work, devastating the economy.</p>
<p>To prevent the spread of the flu in 1918, Alberta's board of health ordered every person to wear a gauze mask outdoors.</p>
<p>Taylor remembers people wearing masks moistened with eucalyptus, which was thought to help prevent the spread of the flu.</p>
<p>"The whole country smelled of eucalyptus. I'm not sure if it did much good. It was horrible," she said. "Whole families went. That was quite common. Terrible."</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- The Toronto Stock Exchange headed into the weekend on a positive note, thanks to rising oil and metals prices, but Friday's gains weren't quite enough to keep Canada's main exchange from recording its first weekly loss in nearly two months.</p>
<p>The S&P/TSX composite index jumped 172.13 points, or 1.85 per cent, to 9,496.96 Friday as gainers outpaced losers by more than three-to-one, and nine of 10 industry groups ended in the black.</p>
<p>Friday's gains helped pare losses suffered during the week that stemmed from the global outbreak of swine flu.</p>
<p>But the benchmark still finished down 0.55 per cent from the previous Friday's close of 9,549.48.</p>
<p>The TSX venture exchange was also higher Friday, jumping 1.19 points, or 0.12 per cent, to 1,010.17, and the Canadian dollar closed at 84.32 cents US, up 50 basis points.</p>
<p>In the U.S., all three major indexes overcame early losses and closed the week more than one per cent higher. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average added 44.29 points, or 0.54 per cent, to 8,212.41. The S&P 500 advanced 4.71 points, or 0.54 per cent, to 877.52, and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 1.9 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 1,719.20.</p>
<p>The materials group was also higher as base metals such as copper rose on the renewed economic sentiment. Gold, meanwhile, fell $3 to $888.20 US an ounce.</p>

<p>If one good thing comes out of this swine flu outbreak, it'll be that people will quit coughing and sneezing into their hands.</p>
<p>I can't believe I'm going to say this, but here goes: Listen to Premier Gordon Campbell.</p>
<p>At a press conference Friday, Campbell even demonstrated -- sans spit and mucus, of course -- the proper technique for sanitary sneezing and careful coughing. You do it into your sleeve, even if it's the sleeve of a nicely tailored grey suit.</p>
<p>Finally, someone in a position of influence is speaking out on this under-appreciated method of disease control.</p>
<p>Anywhere you go in public, you see it all the time: someone blasting a snotty sneeze or hacking deep coughs into their cupped hands. Then they grab the handle of the door to your workplace, or they grab hold of a shopping cart at your grocery store, or they grab the strap on your bus.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization, in a 2007 training brief on preventing influenza pandemics, identifies proper sneeze and cough techniques as a "key measure," noting that if you sneeze or cough into your hands, instead of into your sleeve or a tissue, you should wash your hands immediately using soap.</p>
<p>Using your sleeve, or the crook of your arm if you're in a short-sleeved shirt, or a tissue if you're quick on the draw, helps keep viruses and other germs off public surfaces, minimizing our chances of getting everything from swine flu to a common cold.</p>
<p>As for the swine flu, it's too early to tell whether the average British Columbian has anything to fear. On Friday, provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall predicted that the virus will fade away in B.C. soon, then come back in the fall to produce a "bad flu season."</p>
<p>The WHO has raised an international alarm, which makes sense as a precaution, but it must be remembered that the WHO raises money by raising alarms. The organization's director-general, Dr. Margaret Chan, this week urged all countries to "immediately activate their pandemic-preparedness plans," and in the same statement noted that she had "reached out" to donor countries for "mobilization of resources."</p>
<p>One thing you don't need to worry about is that you'll be left in the dark on this issue. The media loves this story. Some 30 journalists attended Friday's press conference at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver. If the sky starts to fall, you can believe we'll be giving you the blow-by-blow and cough-by-cough.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it makes sense to follow the recommendations of our public health officials, who say that if our kids are sick we should keep them home, and that we should stay off work if we fall ill.</p>
<p>And quit sneezing and coughing into your hands.</p>
<p>Mexico has responded to its outbreak by imposing a five-day holiday across the country to limit transmission within the population.</p>
<p>Not a bad idea for Canada, simply as a precautionary measure. If perchance we're all going to die, it would be nice to have a little time off first.</p>

<div>Special to the Province</div>
<div>1299 words</div><div>3 May 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>In my capacity as an ER physician, I recently came face-to-face, or more accurately mask-to-mask, with my first case of swine flu. My patient was admirably calm, but I still saw a glint of something in her eyes: Fear of the unknown. The whole scenario was painfully reminiscent of our last big infectious threat.</p>
<p>Remember SARS?</p>
<p>In spring 2003, I attended the first city-wide SARS taskforce meeting. The virus had been named only days before and we knew very little about it, except that it was breaking all the usual rules and killing health-care workers in Asia. My gut reaction at the time could be summarized as: "We are all going to die!"</p>
<p>I remember when Dr. Patty Daly, Vancouver's chief medical health officer, calmly reassured everyone at the meeting that we were not facing Armageddon. She explained that SARS did not possess the contagiousness or natural reservoirs (i.e. host animals aside from humans) to sustain itself. She preached a measured response.</p>
<p>I left the meeting still convinced we were all doomed, but time proved Daly right. Aside from the tragic situation in Toronto and a few other limited clusters, on a worldwide scale SARS turned out to be a tempest in a teapot. But it served a critically important purpose as a global dress rehearsal to help prepare us for the next pandemic influenza.</p>
<p>Now we are facing the swine flu, or H1N1 influenza, and the World Health Organization has raised its level of alarm to five out of six in terms of the threat of the virus evolving into the next pandemic.</p>
<p>In my novel Pandemic I envisioned how the world would react to a new threat. I imagined and characterized a worst-case scenario with rampant deaths, widespread panic and governmental collapse.</p>
<p>But the reality is that pandemics come and pandemics go, and no two are the same. History has taught us that, every 30 or 40 years, we can expect a new strain of influenza to evolve so different from previous viruses that it causes "antigenic shift" -- in other words, the virus looks so unfamiliar to our immune systems that we have no natural immunity.</p>
<p>The reason we do not all get sick every flu season is that, to our immune systems, this year's flu virus looks enough like previous ones to give us partial immunity. Only a small percentage of people exposed to the annual flu virus, roughly 10 to 15 per cent, develop symptoms. This is not true of a pandemic, where the infectivity of the virus is much higher.</p>
<p>The great pandemic of 1918-19, a.k.a. the Spanish flu, was the worst medical calamity in recorded time and among the most devastating natural disasters ever. A billion people became infected. Fifty to 100 million died. Most of those victims were young and previously healthy. We have not seen anything even close to it since, though the world has faced two more pandemics since the Spanish flu disappeared.</p>
<p>In the Asian flu of 1956, an estimated one to four million people died; a global death toll not much higher than that of the average flu season. The last pandemic, the Hong Kong flu of 1968, was even milder.</p>
<p>The burning question is not whether the swine flu will become a pandemic, rather how many will develop severe illness or die. That is how pandemics leave their mark.</p>
<p>So far in Canada, no one has become critically ill from swine flu. The deaths have been primarily limited to Mexico, where most of the victims, disturbingly, have been young and healthy, but the overall fatality rate appears to have plateaued. While it is true that influenza viruses behave unpredictably, there is no evidence yet that the swine flu is going to be anywhere near as devastating as the Spanish flu was.</p>
<p>As a physician, I like to think I am measured in my response to</p>
<p>the swine flu, but as a parent, I</p>
<p>do feel a tad antsy.</p>
<p>The good news is there are steps we can take to minimize the risks of catching or (just as importantly) spreading swine flu. Avoiding travel to any places known to have outbreaks of swine flu would be a good start.</p>
<p>But by far the best protective measure is to perform frequent and thorough hand-washing with soap and water or alcohol-based cleansers. Statistically, you are far more likely to catch the flu through hand contact than by being coughed or sneezed upon.</p>
<p>Staying away from hospitals, if possible, is always a good idea, but there are not enough cases to warrant keeping kids home from school or avoiding public places. Nor do you need to go outside gowned-up like a cast member of CSI in mask and biohazard gear. If you choose to wear a mask on a flight or in a hospital, it will lower, but not eliminate, the risk of contracting swine flu.</p>
<p>If you have recently visited Mexico and you develop flu-like symptoms -- fever, fatigue, muscle aches, headache and cough -- you should not go to the ER unless you feel very unwell. Otherwise, phone your family doctor or local clinic before visiting unannounced.</p>
<p>If you have mild flu-like illness (as has been the case for every infected person in Canada so far), you only require the usual supportive treatment such as fluids, acetaminophen or ibuprofen.</p>
<p>The B.C. Centre for Disease Control has stockpiled thousands of doses of the antiviral agent Tamiflu -- which has proven effective in treating severe cases of the swine flu -- but people with mild illness or even typical flu symptoms do not require antiviral medication.</p>
<p>If you are unlucky enough to be infected with the swine flu, you do not need to be isolated 20 metres underground in a kryptonite-encased bunker. You simply have to stay home from work or school for one week following the onset of symptoms and wear a mask to protect those who live with you.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, use your common sense and you should be fine. Be responsible. Cough into your sleeve, not your hand. Do not sneeze on people. And above all, wash your hands!</p>
<p>We do not know whether the swine flu will or will not reach pandemic proportion. But even if it does, the world will not end.</p>
<p>Remember F.D.R.'s words: "There is nothing to fear but fear itself."</p>
<p>Well . . . that and the Spanish flu.</p>
<p>Kalla has written four bestsellers since Pandemic: Rage Therapy, Resistance, Blood Lies and, most recently, Cold Plague. His latest book, Of Flesh and Blood, will be available early in 2010.

</p>
<p>More than 200 pigs on a central Alberta farm have been infected with the swine flu, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said yesterday -- while the total number of Canadians infected with the virus rose to 85.</p>
<p>Federal officials believe the animals contracted the virus from a Canadian worker who returned from Mexico on April 12 and arrived on the farm two days later, showing flu symptoms shortly thereafter, said Brian Evans, Canada's chief veterinary officer, at news conference.</p>
<p>Both the worker and the approximately 220 infected pigs are recovering, but the animals have been quarantined to prevent possible transfer to humans, said Evans.</p>
<p>"The chance that these pigs could transfer the virus to a person is remote. Nevertheless, we're following an appropriately measured approach," Evans said, stressing there is "no food-safety concern related to this finding. Consumption of pork is not considered a route of transmission to humans."</p>
<p>The transfer of a flu virus from humans to pigs is not unheard of, he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of confirmed human cases of swine flu in Canada jumped to 85 yesterday, with most of them coming from Nova Scotia, where 17 new cases were reported. Seven more were from B.C., another seven were from Alberta, plus two in Ontario, and one in Quebec.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia's chief public health officer said that of the new cases, six have no connection with a private boarding school that recently sent a music class to Mexico. In all cases in the province prior to yesterday, all had a link to King's-Edgehill School in Windsor, N.S.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Strang said provincial health officials have been on alert for the swine flu to spread outside of the school.</p>
<p>The good news is that all the patients are experiencing mild symptoms.</p>
<p>"None of these people have been hospitalized. We're not hearing reports of anything other than the mild flu symptoms," he said at a news conference. "Outside of Mexico, in Canada, the swine flu is a mild disease."</p>
<p>In total, there are 31 cases of swine flu in Nova Scotia.</p>

</p>
<p>Global May Day rallies attended by hundreds of thousands of people angered or worried by recession turned ugly in several affected countries yesterday.</p>
<p>The worst violence was seen in Turkey and across a series of European cities, with Cuba's traditional red-letter day focused on ending decades of a U.S. trade embargo and Zimbabwe's prime minister pleading for patience while awaiting international donor investment in that country's shattered economy.</p>
<p>In Germany, on course for its biggest slump since the Second World War, Berlin police made 49 arrests as young demonstrators hurled missiles and set fire to cars and bins.</p>
<p>About 150 far-right extremists were also taken into custody after skinheads attacked a trade union rally in the western German city of Dortmund, as well as police.</p>
<p>Late yesterday, Berlin police also clashed with extremists at a protest organized by a far-left group, resulting in a number of injuries, according to police.</p>
<p>Almost half a million people had earlier assembled peacefully across Germany, unions said.</p>
<p>In Turkey, security forces fired tear gas and water cannons in Istanbul and Ankara, with dozens of police and protesters hurt and more than 100 youths jailed. Protesters smashed the windows of banks and stores.</p>
<p>Violence was also reported in Greece and the Austrian city of Linz, as Chancellor and Social Democrat leader Werner Faymann told up to 100,000 supporters in Vienna that he will oppose proposals by employers to impose a wage freeze.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, there were more than 80 arrests in Zurich, police said, after protesters threw stones, bottles and firebombs at police, who responded with tear gas and water cannon.</p>
<p>Police in Mexico City also clashed with about 200 protesters trying to march on the federal government's palace - despite a suspension of traditional May Day rallies by the government and unions amid a five-day lockdown triggered by the potentially deadly H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, rallies were mostly peaceful, with organizers promising to highlight public anger over millions of job losses.</p>
<p>The leaders of France's eight main unions - presenting a united front for the first time since the Second World War - linked arms to lead a rally in Paris. The CGT union said 1.2 million took part in 300 marches nationwide, although the police said only 465,000 had turned out.</p>
<p>The Spanish government expects nearly one in five workers to be out of a job next year, the worst unemployment rate in Europe, and tens of thousands turned out across Spain.</p>
<p>Leaders of the main unions in Italy held their rally at the town of L'Aquila in a show of solidarity after the devastating earthquake there last month which killed nearly 300.</p>

</p>
<p>Every month, I get $100 from the federal government, or I should say my wife gets a cheque for that amount. It's a small price to pay for Ottawa to compensate me for the costs of raising a four-year-old.</p>
<p>Last month, a flyer was included with my cheque for something called Emergency Preparedness Week, which starts Monday. For the note, the least I could do was read the little blurb from Public Safety Canada.</p>
<p>"Is your family prepared?" read the ominous warning from the government.</p>
<p>Apparently, in addition to all the other costs associated with raising two children, I have to be ready for an emergency that could last up to 72 hours. Something tells me my $100 cheque from the government is about to disappear.</p>
<p>The "72-hour campaign" is now in its third year and perhaps the issue has never been more timely with fear of swine flu now sweeping the world.</p>
<p>"We have gone through as a country a series of natural disasters events -- the flood in Manitoba, the ice storm that caused power outages in Ontario. Those events together helped underline the need for better readiness and better preparedness," said Peter Van Loan, Minister of Public Safety, in an interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Van Loan said the question has come up about whether swine flu is just the latest example of people needing to be prepared.</p>
<p>"It's similar in that one has to worry about broad interests of public safety and public involvement and readiness," said Mr. Van Loan.</p>
<p>If you end up with a full-scale public health disaster, where people have to stay home, [emergency kits] might have some utility. But you'll probably need something longer than 72 hours." For the most part, he said, there a normalization in any emergency situation after the first three days.</p>
<p>When it comes to preparedness, the real debate is whether you want to go beyond 72 hours. There are three steps in the 72-hour plan. The first analyzing the risks in your area, which include everything from earthquakes to hazardous spills.</p>
<p>The second step is to make a plan.</p>
<p>This includes such things as figuring out who could pick up your children if you can't, setting up a meeting place for family to reunite or knowing where your electric box or gas valve is located. The third step the kit.</p>
<p>How much the kit costs ultimately comes down to what you want spend to keep yourself safe for short period of time in an emergency: Do you need to provide for you and your family for three days or 30 days? And what can you not live without? "We know of a person in the city of Toronto who has a $150,000 generator in their backyard. If the city goes down, they can live off the grid. That's the extreme," said Stan Krawitz, of Real Facilities Inc., which advises corporate clients on how to deal with disasters.</p>
<p>"There are lots of differences in what you can spend," said Elinor Fidley, owner of Angel Safety Products, in Fort Langley, B.C. She said food and water for three days is 21.95 a person, according to the Canadian Coast Guard. That includes a 3,600-calorie food bar and 12 half-cup packages of water. "A basic disaster kit is $120 with some basic safety items," said Ms. Fidley, adding that it doesn't include food and water.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A madman among us; How to keep a clear head during the flu crisis</b>
</div><div>Jim Poling Sr.   </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>1178 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>WR02</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.   </div>
</p>
<p>The flu is like the village madman. He is always with us, prowling the shadows, disrupting lives, and annually killing relatively small numbers of people. Once every few decades, he mutates and goes completely berserk, running screaming into the streets and killing large numbers of people before retreating to the shadows.</p>
<p>He rampaged as the Spanish Flu, killing probably 50 million people worldwide in 1918-19. He returned four decades later in 1957-58 as the Asian Flu and killer of two million people. His most recent devastating appearance was in 1968-69 when he took one million lives worldwide as the Hong Kong Flu. Now, another four decades later, he is back as the A(H1N1) Swine Flu and we hold our collective breath waiting to see how savage he will be this time.</p>
<p>We can't get rid of this madman. So we must accept his constant dangerous presence, because only acceptance can create the caution and constant vigilance we must have to protect ourselves properly. If we do not fully accept the reality of killer flu among us, we fall into the dangerous panic-relaxation-panic-relaxation cycle that works against preparation, the critical element in protection.</p>
<p>The most prominent medical experts can't say how serious the current outbreak will be. Even if it burns itself out quickly, it is only a matter of time before another outbreak with pandemic potential is upon us.</p>
<p>Toronto's respiratory outbreak in 2003 (SARS) showed how lack of communication leads to misinformation, confusion and needless panic. Often in times of crisis, Canadians tend to let their governments do their thinking for them. Our health is too important to leave to the politicians and bureaucrats. Individual citizens must inform themselves to better judge the decisions and actions of their governments in life and death matters.</p>
<p>That means gathering your own facts about the flu crisis and analysing them intelligently before reaching your own conclusions. Fortunately, there never has been better access for individual fact gathering. Any individual with computer access to the Internet can quickly gather mountains of news and information about influenza.</p>
<p>Blogs, social networking sites and various forms of citizen reporting can provide useful information, but have the potential for distributing incomplete facts, and information lacking context or perspective. For instance, there is information going around the Internet that no one should be concerned right now because the flu is present only during the winter months. In fact, the flu is present year round, but is more prominent in winter in northern countries because people gather indoors more often.</p>
<p>During the current outbreak, the heaviest burden of providing accurate and useful information will fall on governments and the traditional news media. Governments failed miserably in communicating information during SARS, and the traditional media, although it did some good individual reporting, did not excel in SARS coverage.</p>
<p>Governments in Ontario hopefully are still feeling the sting of Spring of Fear, the 2006 report of the late Mr. Justice Archie Campbell, which documented government inadequacies during SARS. There already is evidence that government performance in this outbreak will be much better because of Justice Campbell's work.</p>
<p>The traditional news media, in a state of decline throughout the world, have an opportunity in the next pandemic to prove to the public that they are important sources of must-have information. To do this they must dedicate themselves to scrupulously transparent reporting that is properly weighted with honest perspective and context. This is no easy task considering today's financial pressures on the media, smaller news holes and slots, and the traditional demands to report news on the fly.</p>
<p>Editors will need to raise standards of accuracy, build better fact checking systems and find ways to convince the public they do not sensationalize to improve revenues. In fact, there isn't much blatant sensationalism in the best of the mainstream media, but the public believes there is. There is, however, unintentional sensationalism created by haste and thoughtless mental slips.</p>
<p>An example: One morning this week the prestigious ABC-TV news operation advertised that it would have an evening report on how the Swine Flu is "criss-crossing" the United States. That morning there were fewer than 60 cases in the U.S., all in small clusters, so the thoughtless reference to "criss-crossing" only added to the potential for hysteria among millions of viewers.</p>
<p>News promos, shouting headlines, newscast voices raised a notch to convey urgency, photos and video selected more for impact than for information: All are drops that can become a bucketful of hysteria.</p>
<p>No one is immune to the high anxiety created by the reporting of climbing Swine Flu numbers. During the past week, many of us have felt our chests tighten at the thought of a killer flu running amok among our families and friends. When I feel like that, here's the advice I give myself, advice based on my experience researching and writing about flu:</p>
<p>* Prepare yourself with factual information collected from sources you trust.</p>
<p>* Put what you learn in context: for instance, hundreds of thousands die globally each year of everyday flu.</p>
<p>* Follow the simple hygiene advice of health officials: Thoroughly washing hands, avoiding unnecessary contact with others, following sneezing and coughing protocols, and keeping respiratory mucous tracts moist to protect them. Dry air compromises the body's defence systems.</p>
<p>* Don't put social graces ahead of infection control. Don't hug, kiss, shake hands or mingle close when you suspect flu or colds are about.</p>
<p>* Be thoughtful when you communicate with others about the flu crisis. This is serious stuff and many people are hypersensitive to it. Toss-off talk done without thought creates anxiety.</p>
<p>* Remember our strengths in any modern flu crisis: Powerful antiviral drugs and much better disease surveillance. Also, remember the tens of thousands of dedicated health-care workers out there working hard for you.</p>
<p>Some years back I was treated for a life-threatening condition by a brilliant, well grounded doctor who worked hard to have me understand the reality of my situation while keeping it in perspective.</p>
<p>"Worry a little," he used to tell me. "But when you have all the best information, there is no need to worry a lot."</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has said a flu pandemic is overdue and is the most serious known health threat facing our world. That should be enough to make us all worry a little.</p>
<p>But if we prepare well and stay well informed, we won't let a little constructive worry become destructive panic.</p>

<p>China is to send a plane to Mexico to bring back some of its citizens, state media said today, after a man tested positive for swine flu in Hong Kong in the first confirmed case in Asia.</p>
<p>The plane was to pick up Chinese citizens who had been due to head back to Shanghai on Sunday on an AeroMexico flight, but had been left stranded after China suspended flights from the flu-hit country, Xinhua said.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization's stated determination to quickly develop a vaccine in response to the Influenza A(H1N1) outbreak is a wise precaution. Far better that the WHO risk criticism for being overcautious in the event that the flu peters out, than that the feared pandemic gets a foothold, and large numbers of people die, because authorities hesitated to act. Questions are already being asked about bureaucratic delays that possibly hindered the early response to the outbreak. The pattern must not be repeated with a vaccine.</p>
<p>On April 16, Mexico reported the emergence of “alarming occurrences of flu and atypical pneumonia” to the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), a regional body of the WHO. It was not until April 24 that the WHO reacted, announcing it was very concerned about the potential for a pandemic. While PAHO officials say Mexico's alert was automatically reported to its parent body, Mexico's chief epidemiologist, Dr. Miguel Angel Lezana, disputes the contention, suggesting it took days for the WHO to be notified by PAHO. Yesterday, PAHO officials argued that, while the WHO had indeed been promptly notified, there had been a delay in alerting other countries. The responsibility for the delay was due to the failure of Mexico to give its permission, a PAHO spokesman said.</p>
<p>This is the sort of bureaucratic nonsense that cannot be tolerated when the stakes are so high. If H1N1 emerges as the pandemic strain that health officials have long feared and warned against, then that eight-day delay may prove to have been very costly indeed. Human lives should not be sacrificed because of incomplete paperwork. Dr. Lezana is correct to call for an investigation of the PAHO and WHO handling of first news of the outbreak, and the role of Mexico in the delay must also be examined. It is outrageous to think that a multinational health organization, once alerted to a disturbing outbreak of flu and pneumonia, would wait idly by because a Mexican official had allegedly failed to fill out a permission form. The WHO must do better in its response to emerging threats in the future, and in the meantime pursue a vaccine with urgency.</p>

</p>
<p>Canadian stocks headed into the weekend on a positive note, thanks to rising oil and metals prices, but Friday's gains weren't quite enough to keep Canada's main exchange from recording its first weekly loss in nearly two months.</p>
<p>The S&P/TSX composite index jumped 172.13 points or 1.85% to 9496.96 yesterday as gainers outpaced losers by more than three-to-one and nine of 10 industry groups ended in the black.</p>
<p>Yesterday's gains helped pare losses suffered during the week that stemmed from the global outbreak of swine flu.</p>
<p>But the benchmark still finished down 0.55% from the previous Friday's close 9549.48. The TSX venture exchange was also higher yesterday, jumping 1.19 points, or 0.1%, to 1010.17, and the Canadian dollar closed at US$0.8432, up 50 basis points.</p>
<p>In the United States, all three major indices overcame early losses and closed the week more than 1% higher. Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average added 44.29 points or 0.54% to 8212.41. The S&P 500 advanced 4.71 points or 0.54% to 877.52 and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 1.90 points or 0.11% to 1719.20.</p>
<p>"It is truly impressive how investors managed to shake off the initial jitters over swine flu at the start of the week, pushing most major markets higher yet again on the week on growing signs that the worst is over for the global downturn and the fact that Mexico is reporting fewer new cases of the flu," said Doug Porter, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p>Commodity prices got a boost yesterday from a new survey that showed in April U.S. consumers felt more confident about the U.S. economy and from new data showing a slowing contraction in the U.S. manufacturing sector. In Toronto, energy stocks were 3.74% higher as oil rose US$2.08 to US$53.20 and <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>. was upgraded to Goldman Sach Group Inc.'s "conviction buy" buy list. Suncor was up nearly 8% to $32.37.</p>
<p>The materials group was also higher as base metals such as copper rose on the renewed economic sentiment. Gold, meanwhile, fell US$3 to US$888.20.</p>
<p>Other stocks making noise yesterday included <span class="companylink">Research in Motion Ltd</span>., and <span class="companylink">Cott Corp</span>. The BlackBerry maker climbed more than 4% after <span class="companylink">UBS</span> analyst Jeffrey Fan upgraded his rating on the company from "neutral" to "buy" and increased his price target from US$85 to US$90. Cott climbed more than 70% yesterday after the generic soft drink maker beat estimates, reporting first-quarter profit of $0.28 a share, compared with its year-earlier loss of $0.30 a share.</p>

<p>Montreal's two blockbuster summer festivals - as well the city's hotel-trade association - intend to follow the lead of health authorities in the event swine flu becomes a bigger issue locally, organizers said yesterday.</p>
<p>The 30th Festival International de Jazz de Montréal, which runs from June 30 to July 12 and has a $29.4-million budget at stake, would "absolutely follow the federal government rules and those of the World Health Organization," spokesperson Marie-ève Boisvert said.</p>
<p>In the event of a flare-up of the H1N1 flu here, health authorities would be expected to severely restrict crowds and public gatherings to reduce transmission.</p>
<p>An outdoor jazzfest crowd can easily top a tightly packed 100,000 people, Boisvert said.</p>
<p>At Just For Laughs, where the 27th edition runs July 16-26, organizers will "observe the situation and evaluate it as it develops," spokesperson Meredith Sharpe said.</p>
<p>Montreal-area hotels have also adopted a similar watch-and-wait stance.</p>
<p>The Hotel Association of Greater Montreal has provided all available information to each of its 76 members, said William Brown, executive vice-president of the trade group.</p>
<p>The "general economy right now is of a great concern to us," Brown said - although "not more so than swine flu, because swine flu could become tomorrow the No. 1 concern."</p>
<p>The city's hotel trade relies heavily on conventions, particularly city-wide conventions, Brown said.</p>
<p>"Some of these are booked years in advance."</p>
<p>The figures for those types of conventions are very encouraging for 2009, he said.</p>
<p>One casualty of the flu situation is a promotional trip to Mexico City that jazzfest president Alain Simard had planned May 18-22, along with singer Coral Egan and her band.</p>
<p>That's been postponed, Boisvert said, either for several weeks or until next year - depending on developments.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>How deadly is H1N1? (and other questions); How to tell swine flu from ordinary flu</b>
</div><div>AARON DERFEL   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>761 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>PART 1 OF 2</p>
<p>With one case of swine flu confirmed in Montreal, local infectious-disease experts predict it's only a matter of time before the city's hospitals see many more infected patients.</p>
<p>However, experts say that the latest evidence suggests that the influenza A H1N1 strain is spreading more slowly than initially feared. What's more, there have been no deaths to date in Canada from the swine flu.</p>
<p>Yet despite the relatively low number of cases in Canada thus far - 51 - doctors and hospitals are being bombarded with questions from anxious Montrealers. The following is a primer on the swine flu.</p>
<p>Is this a new strain?</p>
<p>Yes, and therefore, people have not built up a natural immunity to it. It's highly unusual in its composition: one part North American swine flu virus, one part North American avian influenza, one part human influenza and one part swine flu virus commonly found in Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms of swine flu?</p>
<p>Generally, the symptoms are similar to regular human flu: a fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, chills and fatigue. But swine flu can also cause diarrhea and vomiting. In extreme cases, the U.S. Centres for Disease Control warn, swine flu can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure and death.</p>
<p>How deadly is this strain?</p>
<p>The short answer is: Nobody really knows.</p>
<p>"But the fact that there are very large clusters of unusual respiratory deaths in Mexico in young people is cause for concern," said Brian Ward, a microbiologist and infectious-diseases physician at the McGill University Health Centre.</p>
<p>In a typical flu season, one in 1,000 infected people will die from the disease. That's a kill rate of one-tenth of one per cent. In Canada, 10 to 15 per cent of the population falls sick each year with the flu, or at least 3.3 million people. Of that number, 2,000 to 4,000 mostly elderly and frail Canadians die from it.</p>
<p>In a pandemic, the flu mortality rate is at least a half per cent. In Canada, that would translate into about 16,500 deaths.</p>
<p>During the 1918-19 Spanish flu epidemic - considered the worst of all time - about 40 million people worldwide died. No one knows for certain what the mortality rate was, but many experts place it at between one and two per cent.</p>
<p>In Canada, a flu mortality rate of two per cent would translate into at least 66,000 deaths - about 30 times worse than the average flu season.</p>
<p>In Mexico, where the swine flu originated, the World Health Organization has definitively linked the virus to seven deaths. But there are also reports that more than 150 Mexicans have died from flu-like respiratory infections.</p>
<p>Although the data on deaths are accurate, no one knows how many Mexicans have been infected with swine flu. Initial news reports of more than 2,400 people infected are probably a huge under-estimate, experts say.</p>
<p>Thus, it would be a big mistake to divide 150 deaths by 2,400 infections and arrive at a mortality rate of six per cent.</p>
<p>What have troubled WHO officials, however, are two dramatic developments: the newness of the virus and the fact that many young, otherwise healthy individuals have died.</p>
<p>"This resembles what went on in the 1918 pandemic - young people (in their 20s and 30s) dying," said Mark Miller, chief of infection control at the Jewish General Hospital.</p>
<p>However, Miller cautioned that there might be complicating factors in the Mexican deaths: pre-existing lung illness in some individuals, malnourishment, slum-like conditions and a lack of health resources.</p>
<p>If someone catches the swine flu and recovers, would he or she be immune from the virus?</p>
<p>Yes, they would develop antibodies against the disease.</p>
<p>However, once a vaccine is developed to fight swine flu - and that could take a few months - it would still be advisable to get a shot, Ward said. That's because the virus could mutate into a more lethal strain in the coming months.</p>
<p>The 1918-19 pandemic occurred in three waves, and the second wave, five months after the first, was by far the deadliest.</p>
<p>Should pregnant women be vaccinated?</p>
<p>Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to the flu, and would be given priority for vaccination in the event of a pandemic, Ward said.</p>
<p>Part 2 of the swine flu primer appears tomorrow.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health experts caution against swine flu hysteria; Many unknowns in spread of disease. This is a public health problem, not a return of the 1918 Spanish flu, some critics argue</b>
</div><div>SHARON KIRKEY   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>815 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Cancelled school trips, passengers in Heathrow en route to Canada in face masks, Catholic priests in Edmonton recommending worshippers stop shaking hands in peace and just nod their heads instead.</p>
<p>As human swine flu reached 11 countries yesterday, critics feared "swine flu hysteria" may spread faster than the virus itself.</p>
<p>We're going down a road with no road map, some say, with nothing to tell people how scared they should be. Given the lack of hard evidence, blind panic and total calm can both make sense.</p>
<p>Among the big unknowns: Will swine flu stay in the human population to become another seasonal flu strain? Will it die out entirely? Is the virus genetically stable as it moves from human to human? Or is it evolving, changing its properties to become more lethal?</p>
<p>We might be better off consulting the phases of the moon for insights, says University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown.</p>
<p>But "the current trend both inside and outside of Mexico is reassuring," Brown said. "We aren't seeing explosive spread with cases of pneumonia."</p>
<p>New Brunswick confirmed its first case of swine flu yesterday which, along with new cases in B.C., Alberta and Nova Scotia, raised Canada's total to 51 since the first cases in Canada were reported on April 26.</p>
<p>By contrast, 1,092 Canadians tested positive for seasonal influenza during just a one-week period, from March 1 to March 7.</p>
<p>Nearly half (47 per cent) of Canadians are concerned they, or someone in their family, might contract swine flu, according to an Ipsos Reid poll for Canwest News Service and Global National. Fifteen per cent of 1,001 adults surveyed from April 29 to April 30 said they were "very much" concerned.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a <span class="companylink">United Airlines</span> flight from Germany to Washington was diverted to Boston because a female passenger complained of flu symptoms. Egypt has ordered a nationwide pig slaughter. U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden said Thursday he wouldn't travel anywhere in a confined space because of swine flu.</p>
<p>"All the talk of pandemics just gets people worked up, when what we're looking at here is a public health problem," said Philip Alcabes, author of Dread: How Fear and Fantasy Have Fueled Epidemics from the Black Death to the Avian Flu. People are getting sick, Alcabes said, "but it's not a crisis."</p>
<p>Horror fantasies about the flu are always about the possibility of a repeat of 1918 Spanish flu, he says. Images of horse-drawn carriages carrying corpses and of people dropping dead in the street have become somehow iconic in our thinking about flu, he says.</p>
<p>"And I think that's a shame. Because there's a lot of influenza, it's a public health problem every year in North America."</p>
<p>It makes a lot of people sick, and it kills a lot of people, he says. "But only once in history has there been a terrible (flu) disaster, and that was 1918."</p>
<p>But the world was a different place. "We didn't have the science we have now," said Alcabes, associate professor of urban public health at Hunter College of the City University of New York. "We didn't have the public apparatus we have now."</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has dropped the name "swine flu" for influenza A (H1N1) over worries the name was causing people to avoid pork. Swine flu hasn't been shown to be transmissible to people through eating properly handled and prepared pork products.</p>
<p>Changing the name is "all politics," said Tim Blackmore, a professor in media studies at the University of Western Ontario.</p>
<p>"It doesn't serve us well at all for people to be using the world 'pandemic,' to be raising rates of warnings."</p>
<p>The World Health Organization raised its alert level on Wednesday to Phase 5 on a six-phase scale. "Six is what, the bubonic plague?" Blackmore said.</p>
<p>At the Toronto General and Toronto Western hospitals, triage nurses in emergency rooms are wearing masks and any patient who fails a "febrile respiratory survey" is put into isolation and tested.</p>
<p>"If this dies down in the next couple of weeks, that would be wonderful," said Anil Chopra, chief of emergency medicine program at University Health Network.</p>
<p>"But we don't want to look back and say, we weren't prepared, we didn't take the right precautions and then learn we unnecessarily allowed this virus to spread."</p>

<p>The number of confirmed cases of swine flu in Canada has topped 50. Public health officials are busy preparing for the worst, and ordinary people are worried.</p>
<p>Yet no one has died yet in Canada - all known cases of the H1Ni flu have been mild - and some critical voices are cautioning that swine flu hysteria is spreading faster than the illness.</p>
<p>So, how much anxiety is realistically warranted?</p>
<p>We speak to some North American experts.</p>
<p>Gazette medical reporter Aaron Derfel has also prepared a two-part primer that explains some of the background of swine flu and answers some of the most common questions - for example, how deadly is this disease? And what should you be looking for?</p>

<p>Treat Lafleur Like Anyone Else</p>
<p>Guy Lafleur, convicted of obstructing justice, should be given the standard penalty for his offence, neither more nor less.</p>
<p>The hockey great gave contradictory evidence at a 2007 bail hearing for his drug-troubled son Mark Lafleur. It was a parent's mistake, and not one anybody wants to see punished fiercely. Such an offence can bring up to 14 years in jail, but sentences like that should be reserved for really serious cases.</p>
<p>On the other hand Lafleur's status as a Montreal icon should bring him no advantage in sentencing. He did wrong, and the law must apply impartially to all. The Crown has, reasonably, asked for no jail time, but an absolute discharge would not be appropriate, either.</p>
<p>Keep Prized Medals in Canada</p>
<p>Only 94 Canadians have ever won the Victoria Cross, perhaps the world's most prestigious medal of valour. Now one of these treasured icons could leave the country. The VC awarded to Robert Shankland of Winnipeg for his courage at Passchendaele may bring $300,000 at a Toronto auction this month.</p>
<p>The government should find the money to keep this VC in Canada. Then-veterans'-affairs minister Albina Guarnieri got this right in 2004, when another Canadian VC was on sale: "Every Victoria Cross that was earned by Canadians should stay in Canada."</p>
<p>Another Victory for Gurkhas</p>
<p>In Britain this week MPs of all parties came together, some Labour members spurning their leaders, to vote against new limits on Gurkha ex-servicemen's right to move to Britain. The vote was non-binding but Gordon Brown's government can hardly ignore it.</p>
<p>For almost 200 years these men from Nepal have fought for Britain, repeatedly re-earning their reputation for loyalty, courage, and exemplary soldiering, most recently in Afghanistan. Brown's move was intended to save money but a Parliamentary committee called it "unnecessarily restrictive, morally wrong, and offensive." It should be reversed.</p>
<p>Fair Play for Pigs</p>
<p>In Egypt, and a few other places, panicky governments are killing pigs, in a brainless attempt to stop the so-called "swine flu." But pigs and pork do not spread this flu. What will happen when those governments figure out that the disease is really spread by ... humans?</p>

</div><div>Michelle Lang; With Files From Jason Markusoff And Jamie
Komarnicki   </div>
<div>For the Calgary Herald And Canwest News Service;</div>
<div>805 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>As Alberta announced two more mild cases of swine flu -- including one in a Calgary woman who had travelled in Tennessee--the province's top doctor asked Albertans on Friday not to clog the health system with unnecessary tests for the virus.</p>
<p>Alberta Health said the new cases of the flu, which medical officials are now calling H1N1,were in two Calgarians: a young woman who had been in Mexico and a middle-aged woman who had been in Tennessee.</p>
<p>The case is the first time an Albertan with the virus contracted the disease outside of Mexico. Both women are recovering at home.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer, said it appears some employers in the province have been sending staff who are returning from Mexico for testing before they come back to work.</p>
<p>He said tests are only necessary for those who have been in Mexico and have symptoms of the flu, adding most of these cases turn out to be other ailments, like the common cold.</p>
<p>"We're appealing to people be reasonable, not to clog our health system unnecessarily with these kinds of demands," said Corriveau, adding companies and individuals with questions should go to Alberta Health's website.</p>
<p>Friday's cases bring the total number of infections from the virus to eight in Alberta--seven in Calgary and one in a boy from northern Alberta. In Canada, the total number of confirmed cases of H1N1 grew to 51,with New Brunswick confirming its first case.</p>
<p>All the cases in this country have been mild and Canada's chief public health officer expressed optimism the outbreak might turn out to be relatively mild.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones said he hopes the flu will die down over the summer, buying time to develop a vaccine.</p>
<p>This would ensure "whatever we face in the fall, whether it's mild or severe, we're in a better position to deal with it," he said.</p>
<p>Globally, 15 countries have now reported cases of swine flu, with China, France, Denmark and South Korea confirming cases Friday and early today.</p>
<p>The cases come as the World Health Organization said Friday re-searchers had cleared the first step toward a H1N1 vaccine, and drug manufacturers would likely agree to enter production if the outbreak doesn't abate soon.</p>
<p>Although the number of confirmed cases continued to increase across the world, WHO gave no indication it would raise its pandemic-alert level, which is currently five on a six-point scale.</p>
<p>Mexico, meanwhile, cut its estimated death toll from the virus to up to 101, from 176.</p>
<p>In Tennessee, health department officials were not informed that a Calgary woman had a mild bout of the flu after travelling there.</p>
<p>There have been no confirmed H1N1 cases among Tennesseans, although three private school students in the Nashville and Memphis areas have "probable" cases.</p>
<p>Alberta health officials would not say where in Tennessee the Calgary woman had travelled. Nor did they apparently let state authorities know about her case.</p>
<p>"To the best of our knowledge, there is no record of receiving information on this case," said Andrea Turner, spokeswoman for the Tennessee Department of Health.</p>
<p>Alberta Health representatives said the province is responsible for alerting the Public Health Agency of Canada, which would then talk with U. S. officials.</p>
<p>In Alberta, Corriveau has said the risk from the outbreak is very low. Still, concerns have led to a surge in calls to a provincial medical helpline, HealthLink. Earlier this week, Corriveau said Alberta Health Services was establishing a separate phone line to take questions. On Friday, he said a final decision hasn't been made on whether to move ahead with the new line.</p>
<p>The City of Calgary has also implemented its infectious disease management plan to co-ordinate how various departments deal with the virus.</p>
<p>Members, including police, fire, paramedic and transportation representatives, have been meeting regularly this week, said Tom Sampson, acting director of Calgary's Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>Sampson stressed that the city's risk is minimal, but said the emergency team is poised to ensure essential services are provided if the situation escalates.</p>
<p>"The City of Calgary has a strong record of effective emergency preparedness response. In this situation, we're ready," Sampson said.</p>

officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, said Friday there are several
encouraging signs to suggest the H1N1 flu outbreak may not be a
catastrophic pandemic. "What gives me short-term optimism is that
we're at the end of what would be normally flu season,"he said.

<p>I manage to live a fairly normal life anyway, but all numbering and measuring systems escape me. I don't understand nautical miles or the weather. Celsius and Fahrenheit mean nothing to me. I judge these things entirely by the tone of voice that is used when someone says them.</p>
<p>If someone says to me, “It's minus 27,” but they say it in a really happy voice, I walk outside in a tank top. And if someone were to say to me proudly, “I live in a 200-square-foot apartment!” I'd assume that he must have full-time staff.</p>
<p>The heights, weights, numbers of teeth and years of birth of my children – facts I'm apparently expected to know – are not known, not by me, much of the time anyway. After all, is this motherhood or baseball?</p>
<p>At one point, I was called in for a very serious meeting at my child's school to discuss his progress in kindergarten. The teacher was there. The principal too.</p>
<p>My child was weird, they told me (although I think they used another word), but he was good. So good that it was impossible, 14 weeks into school, to ignore the situation. He was really good.</p>
<p>As far as his vocabulary and comprehension skills were concerned, my child was blowing every other student out of the water, the teacher said (using somewhat less hierarchical language). “And he reads a lot, even somewhat critically,” they added.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know,” I said proudly. “Pretty damn cool, isn't it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. ‘Cool,' ” they said.</p>
<p>“It'd be remarkable,” the teacher told me earnestly, “even if he weren't so very young.”</p>
<p>And then she pointed to my child, who was outside in the playground, making lines in the sand. She was probably bringing up the weird again.</p>
<p>I briefly waved to him. I was tidying up my makeup case and nervously crossing and uncrossing my legs, as I do in tense situations. I still get edgy in a principal's office. I'm concerned lest they search my locker.</p>
<p>“That level of literacy in a child who's by far the youngest in the class …” she continued.</p>
<p>“I'm pretty sure Jack's younger,” I volunteered.</p>
<p>She shook her head. “No, he's not.”</p>
<p>We almost argued. And then she fetched my child's file and it turned out that when I had registered my darling first-born at the school, I had written down the date of his birth incorrectly. I had it wrong by one year – which I think is pretty good, since I was likely guesstimating. And yet, strangely, even after we had sorted out this mistake, the teacher and the principal seemed noticeably more and not less concerned about my apparent lack of vision for my child's education.</p>
<p>When, in the course of our discussion, I mentioned that I had left school after Grade 9, their tone became outright alarmed.</p>
<p>I realized that although we had now established that my child wasn't quite as precocious as they had thought, their concern was now not so much that the child was extremely gifted as that his mother was a moron.</p>
<p>They looked over at me (still organizing my makeup case) and understandably concluded that the situation they had on their hands was much like the scenario in that Jody Foster movie – the one where the genius child is being raised by a cocktail waitress. I guess in the end they decided that I was one of those goodhearted cocktail waitresses because they let me keep him.</p>
<p>It's this same child, now older, who's been keeping me abreast of swine-flu news all week. I know that he knows me pretty well: He came into my office early in the week and said dramatically, “The threat level's been raised to 4!”</p>
<p>I just said, “I'm on to you. Say it as crazy-crazy as you like. Four's not a big number. You're going to school.”</p>
<p>I checked a website. Level 4 is wash your hands and don't kiss strangers.</p>
<p>“Call me when I'm ordered to get a full manicure-pedicure, not when it's just officially not New Year's Eve,” I added.</p>
<p>But then we reached level 5. And I scrolled down the World Health Organization page and saw that the scale goes only to level 6. Sorry: Level 6!!!!</p>
<p>Even I know that nothing stops at 6. It's so unalarmist, it's alarming. I'm assuming there are four more levels no one's telling us about.</p>

</p>
<p>Toronto 1918 - a city of a half-million people, but the streets seem empty, the result of 70,000 young Torontonians having enlisted in World War I. Suddenly and without warning, an enemy deadlier than any German weapon appears in one of many military camps across town.</p>
<p>The Spanish flu reached Toronto on Sept. 29, 1918. Within a month, half the population was infected by this highly infectious pathogen. Once the fever, diarrhea and other symptoms had dissipated, more than 1,750 Torontonians were dead. Across Canada, some 50,000 people died from that flu, many of them between 20 and 40 years old. One way the flu strain killed was by triggering an extreme reaction in the immune system. Around the world the death toll is estimated to have reached upwards of 40 million, compared to roughly 10 million victims of the Great War.</p>
<p>For years the World Health Organization has warned that the world is overdue for the next great pandemic. Recent fears that avian flu might kill millions have been replaced in recent weeks by fears of swine flu. But it still isn't clear whether this flu is the one we've been warned about.</p>
<p>Few people alive today remember the last great pandemic that gripped the globe in 1918-1919.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Star asked readers to share family stories about that pandemic. The responses told of lines of horse-drawn hearses on the Danforth and volunteers digging mass graves in Prospect Cemetery.</p>
<p>Christine Featherstone recounted a story told by her grandfather, Dr. Charles Clark, an ear nose and throat specialist in Toronto in 1918.</p>
<p>"He arrived at a patient's home late in the evening, his last call of the day. No one answered the front door, but it was open, so he went in. He found two children dead in the living room, then went upstairs and found the mother dead in the bedroom with her baby dead in the bassinette beside her."</p>
<p>The flu worked its way into the trenches of Western Europe in early 1918, but its severity wasn't recognized until troops began transporting it back to their homelands.</p>
<p>When it appeared in Toronto on Sept. 29, few paid it much notice. Ten days later a Toronto schoolgirl died at Toronto General Hospital. Some speculated she was Toronto's first civilian flu victim. Two days later Dr. Charles Hastings, Toronto's medical officer of health, asked the press to "tell the people to keep as fit as possible, to avoid anything which might give them colds, and not to worry any more about it." By Oct. 3, the Military Base Hospital on Gerrard St. E. had 500 cases of the flu.</p>
<p>By Oct. 8, nearly 260 teachers and 10,000 students were reported absent from school.</p>
<p>Hotels began doubling as emergency hospitals, and the Star began calling for local schools to be closed.</p>
<p>By Oct. 9, undertakers couldn't keep up with the death toll. Cemeteries were ordered to stay open for Sunday burials, and on Oct. 19, the city ordered theatres, movie halls and other public areas closed.</p>
<p>Only medical personnel were ordered to wear masks. Still, the Star reported that women on the streets were wearing veils over their faces.</p>
<p>By Oct. 26, thousands of railway operators across the country were ill, exacerbating a coal shortage.</p>
<p>Even after the last flu deaths were recorded in early November, normalcy took its time to return to the city. Children were left without parents, parents were left without children, and thousands were left to grieve even as news broke that peace had been declared in Europe.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu HQ in name only - Winnipeg scientists summoned to the real head office in Ottawa</b>
</div><div>By Mia Rabson   </div>
<div>1320 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>55111But some eyebrows have been raised at the presence of the agency's senior officials in Ottawa every day. How much political interference is going into the scientific decisions being made about this flu?</p>
<p>"There is an argument that in a time of national crisis, you don't want those decisions being made too close to the political arm," said Reg Alcock, the former Liberal cabinet minister from Manitoba who was involved in the decision to locate the PHAC headquarters in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>"That's a reason for having it outside the capital."</p>
<p>The National Microbiology Laboratory and research into the newly renamed influenza A/H1N1 virus are in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>But all week, chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones worked in Ottawa, from Health Canada's main headquarters at Tunney's Pasture.</p>
<p>In fact, even when there is no crisis, Butler-Jones spends most of his time in Ottawa.</p>
<p>With him this week was Dr. Frank Plummer, scientific director of the National Microbiology Lab, the Public Health Agency's centrepiece and the reason the government decided to headquarter the agency in Winnipeg in the first place.</p>
<p>So while research into the virus's origins and a vaccine is underway on Winnipeg's Arlington Street, the chief scientist and the chief decision-maker are 2,200 kilometres east.</p>
<p>Alcock says that is a direct result of Health Canada officials being unable to accept that any other place can function as well, if not better, as offices in Ottawa.</p>
<p>"Can you provide the mass public health operation in a crisis from Winnipeg as well as you can from Ottawa?" he asked. "Of course."</p>
<p>In fact, a lab at a distance from Ottawa may be an improvement, Alcock said, because the scientists are less likely to bend to government pressure to respond in a certain way.</p>
<p>Winnipeg NDP MP Pat Martin said beckoning Butler-Jones and Plummer to the capital makes no sense.</p>
<p>"If you're based in Winnipeg and your work is there, why are they here?" Martin asked. "There's a good reason why there is supposed to be distance between Health Canada, the government and the Public Health Agency. They should be arm's length."</p>
<p>A spokesman from the Public Health Agency refused a request to speak with Plummer or Butler-Jones about their absence from Winnipeg or the impact it has on their work.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq's spokesman said she would look into the Free Press request but didn't reply after that.</p>
<p>Alcock said Butler-Jones and Plummer working from Ottawa in times of crisis was an inevitable outcome of splitting the Public Health Agency's offices between Ottawa and Winnipeg. Alcock says that bugged him at the time and it still bugs him today.</p>
<p>The need for a national public health agency became apparent in 2003, when SARS killed 44 people in Toronto and Health Canada did not appear capable of properly responding to the mysterious respiratory illness.</p>
<p>But there was a lot of political bellyaching and gnashing of teeth about where to locate the agency.</p>
<p>Vancouver wanted it and Ottawa didn't want to let go of the public health offices it already had.</p>
<p>Manitoba politicians, health professionals and business leaders lobbied hard to have the federal agency in Winnipeg, citing the National Microbiology Lab here which made the city a natural choice.</p>
<p>It is the only Level 4 lab in Canada, and it has been central to all the major public health issues facing Canada, from the West Nile virus to avian flu, SARS and now swine flu.</p>
<p>The Liberal government ultimately chose Winnipeg and the Conservatives supported the decision when they took over in 2006, introducing and passing the legislation that created the agency.</p>
<p>Though Winnipeg seemed content to get the headquarters, the reality always was that the agency would have two heads -- the scientific side would be in Winnipeg, but the rest would be in Ottawa.</p>
<p>And it shows.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones was to be based in Winnipeg. In reality, he is not, but a lot of taxpayer money is spent to make it appear he is.</p>
<p>He expensed $186,596.02 on travel between March 2008 and March 2009. The vast majority of those trips were to Ottawa, where he rents an apartment for about $900 a month.</p>
<p>His travels meant he spent little more than one day in four in Winnipeg, the city where he is supposed to be based. In some months, he spent just hours on the ground in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>He spent more than one day in every three in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett, who was the public health minister when the agency was created, is fine with that. She said this week the former Liberal government's vision of the agency is being carried out exactly as planned.</p>
<p>"The command centre was meant to be in Winnipeg, but the (operations) centre was always meant to be in Ottawa," Bennett said.</p>
<p>She said the command centre in Winnipeg is where Plummer speaks to scientists around the world and across Canada, as well as monitors scientific developments.</p>
<p>Bennett could not explain why Plummer is in Ottawa this week, suggesting he may have gone back to Winnipeg Thursday. But he had not.</p>
<p>She said having the decision-makers in Ottawa is necessary because of the overlap with other departments such as transportation, border security and defence.</p>
<p>"Bringing those bodies together is hugely important," she said.</p>
<p>Alcock countered that with today's technology, there is no reason for everyone to be around a boardroom table in the same place.</p>
<p>"(The Winnipeg lab building) takes teleconferencing to a whole new level," Alcock said.</p>
<p>A $3-million communications centre was built at the lab in Winnipeg for situations like the current flu crisis.</p>
<p>Manitoba Premier Gary Doer, who spent months lobbying for the agency, said the country had no nationally co-ordinated public health plan before the agency was established. Doer's vision of the agency was that it would become the Canadian version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</p>
<p>"Canada worked in separate silos of information and in provinces, rather than a command-and-control operation with considerable collaboration on detecting disease, potential treatments and ultimately a cure," he said.</p>
<p>But now he says the public is getting all the information.</p>
<p>Still, Doer believes more of the PHAC structure should be centred in Manitoba.</p>
<p>"My view is the more of command and control in Winnipeg, the better," he said. "It's still not exactly the same as Atlanta."</p>
<p>The American briefings on the flu outbreak include both politicians in Washington and CDC officials in Atlanta, both in their own domain -- science coming from the lab, politics coming from Washington.</p>
<p>Judy Wasylycia-Leis, the NDP health critic and MP for Winnipeg North, is not concerned about where Butler-Jones or Plummer works.</p>
<p>"It's still running out of Winnipeg," she said. "It doesn't matter where they are. It's still the lab doing the job on the ground. The key decisions are being made independent of the minister."</p>
<p>She said having Butler-Jones and Plummer in Ottawa with Aglukkaq for the briefings gives the public a measure of confidence that the government's decisions are being made according to science.</p>
<p>Wasylycia-Leis said that in the 12 years she has been an MP, many of them as her party's health critic, she has never once received a call from the health minister to update a critical situation -- until now. Aglukkaq called her on the weekend. Wasylycia-Leis thinks the improved parliamentary communications result from having an agency tasked solely with handling this crisis.</p>
<p>"The public health agency is demonstrating its mettle," she said. "We haven't had a real test yet."</p>

</p>
<p>Dr. Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief medical officer</p>
<p>CLAIM TO FAME:</p>
<p>Kettner is the public health boss and the point man for potentially life-and-death decisions should a pandemic flu hit Manitoba.</p>
<p>LATE START:</p>
<p>Kettner grew up in the North End and, as a boy, was more interested in live theatre than hospital emergency rooms.</p>
<p>His early theatre training landed him small parts on local stages, including Rainbow Stage and two productions at Manitoba Theatre Centre. His father, a university physicist, urged him to consider medicine.</p>
<p>"For a variety of reasons, I reached a conclusion it would be smarter to get a profession and try acting later than to start off acting and change my mind," Kettner said. "So I got a day job first, and someday, (I'd) see if I had talent."</p>
<p>At the University of Manitoba, he studied general arts and sciences before entering medical school. He went on to work in the St. Boniface Hospital emergency room for two years and later continued his training in London, England, where he obtained his masters degree in epidemiology.</p>
<p>By then, Kettner had morphed from a long-haired "hippie" med student to a highly educated specialist with a keen interest in community health. He came back to Winnipeg and studied community medicine under Dr. Brian Postl. Kettner started work as a medical officer of health in 1990 in places like Thompson, The Pas and Selkirk.</p>
<p>Kettner assumed the top public health job in the province in 1999.</p>
<p>LONG HOURS:</p>
<p>Aside from leading the provincial health system, he fills occasional emergency room shifts at Grace Hospital and admits his days sometime start as early as 4 a.m.</p>
<p>Kettner has daily hour-long teleconferences about H1N1 flu with national and provincial health leaders and is inundated with a barrage of email updates, phone calls and requests. "I've been getting between four and six hours of sleep a night," he said.</p>
<p>Still, the flu threat didn't keep Kettner from enjoying a night off this week to take in a Leonard Cohen concert.</p>
<p>TOUGH DECISIONS:</p>
<p>When Kettner's email alerted him to a mysterious viral outbreak in Mexico two weeks ago, he didn't think the illness would develop into a worldwide health scare.</p>
<p>He is in the spotlight, but the chief medical officer relies on a team of public health doctors and experts to make decisions.</p>
<p>"I just happen to be the alpha wolf right now," he said. "It can be very scary, especially when you think of the significance and impacts of the decision."</p>

</p>
<p>As of April 29, 160 people might have died of H1N1 flu -- eight confirmed. Globally.</p>
<p>The current flu responds well to available anti-viral agents. The media would have us avoid public places, scrub 1,000 times a day with various concoctions (all available from your nearest pharmacy at a price), wear surgical masks should we dare to venture outside, but above all, be very afraid and stay glued to the TV for yet more fear mongering. Fear sells newspapers and advertising time on TV. For the hawkers of print and video advertising, fear is good.</p>
<p>You are far more likely to die from a number of other causes which you aren't currently losing sleep over. Why get stressed about this one? And, should the flu "epidemic" prove as deadly as the 1918 flu, panic is still the worst response -- to any situation.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The world could do more to fight H1N1 flu</b>
</div><div>Gwynne Dyer   </div>
<div>767 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>At the time of writing, almost a week after we all learned that a lethal new strain of influenza had appeared in Mexico, every single death attributed to N1H1 has been Mexican, and all but one of those deaths happened in Mexico itself. (The one exception was a Mexican toddler visiting Texas with his family.)</p>
<p>Our elders and betters assure us that a travel ban would not help. The World Health Organization's assistant director-general, Keiji Fukuda, tells us that trying to contain the virus by enforcing travel restrictions "is not a feasible option." Besides, he says, "the virus has already spread to several other countries." Texas Gov. Rick Perry says that closing the U.S. border with Mexico, crossed by tens of thousands each day, would be "a little premature."</p>
<p>Am I alone in experiencing a desire to strangle these people? To begin with, Rick, you either close the U.S. border now, or you don't bother. Closing it a week from now would be completely pointless. If human-to-human transmission of the virus has not already taken root in the United States, it will certainly have done so once another few hundred thousand people have crossed the border.</p>
<p>It may be too late to stop the spread of the virus by banning non-emergency travel to and from Mexico, but nobody knows that for sure. The virus has already appeared in a dozen other countries, but at this point almost all the victims are still people who were recently in Mexico. If the flow of further people from Mexico dwindled rapidly as the remaining tourists and business travellers came home, there would still be a chance of containing the virus.</p>
<p>If this flu really is like the Spanish influenza virus that killed tens of millions of healthy young adults in 1918-19, then we should be doing everything possible to hold it at bay. And even if the virus is bound to get out of Mexico in the end, it's worth winning some time before it does.</p>
<p>It is spring across the northern hemisphere, where most of the world's people live, and flu typically goes into retreat in the spring and summer. Even if it comes back in the northern autumn -- and pandemic flu often comes in several waves some months apart, becoming more virulent in the later waves -- by then we might have a vaccine ready. The process of designing and mass-producing the vaccine takes four to six months, which is exactly what immediate and severe restrictions on travel to Mexico now might win us.</p>
<p>So why do government bureaucrats everywhere, together with the international civil servants of the World Health Organization, assure us in massed chorus that travel bans are futile? Because they work for governments whose economies could be severely damaged by those bans.</p>
<p>Governments do accept a certain responsibility for protecting the lives of their citizens, but even in the developed world, where resources are not scarce, they interpret that responsibility quite differently. Britain and France have stockpiled antiviral medicines like Tamiflu for 50 per cent of their citizens (and Britain is now going to over 80 per cent). Japan, Australia and New Zealand are all over 40 per cent, but the United States only has 25 per cent cover and Canada a mere 17 per cent.</p>
<p>The biggest difference, however, is between the vague, general responsibility that governments feel for the lives of their citizens and the acute, real-time responsibility they feel for the health of their economies. They are inundated daily by demands from commercial and industrial organizations to keep the borders open and commerce flowing. They are not inundated by demands by powerful citizen organizations to impose travel bans and save lives.</p>
<p>So they yield to the greater pressure, as governments generally do. At the extreme, they conspire to hide the disease altogether, as China did with SARS and Mexico may have done for some time with N1H1. And they lie routinely about the usefulness of stopping travel from infected countries, because to do so would gum up international commerce and damage economies.</p>
<p>The less reflective ones may not even realize any more that they are lying, because within WHO and the various national governments it has become an article of faith that you can't contain pandemics once they move beyond the first few villages. But that is quite obviously nonsense. Nonsense that could kill your kids.</p>

<p>Re: SARS Lessons Help With Swine Flu, Ontario Says -- April 28</p>
<p>I am not sure if I can believe what I read: Ontario has learned from the experiences with SARS in 2003. Has it? Let me mention three little examples.</p>
<p>On family doctors: I moved to Canada on temporary work permit in July 2008. I called many medical clinics to get registered. The majority hung up the phone even before giving me a chance to talk about my approach.</p>
<p>On dentists: I tried to get an appointment at a recommended dentist clinic. I got offered an appointment two months later (it was an emergency) because I hadn't been to that clinic before.</p>
<p>On hospital emergency rooms: My colleague went to a hospital in the area for an emergency case with one of his kids. He spent seven hours waiting in the middle of the night before being served.</p>
<p>I am trying to draw a picture in my head of what will happen when thousands of people try to get health care in a pandemic flu situation. If the system is not able to help the people in a normal situation, how can it work in an emergency that affects wide parts of the population?</p>
<p>Impossible. I'd rather buy a plane ticket and fly my family back to Europe in such a case. I'll still be served faster than here.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>The federal government expanded its flu-prevention campaign to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Twitter and YouTube as the number of confirmed cases continued to climb yesterday.</p>
<p>Officials announced a new "citizen-readiness campaign'' as the number of confirmed Canadian cases of the flu strain known as H1N1 jumped to 51.</p>
<p>A total of 20 new cases were reported, including six each in Nova Scotia and B.C., four in Ontario, two in Alberta, and one each in Quebec and New Brunswick.</p>
<p>But in the midst of that Canadian officials were sounding hopeful.</p>
<p>The country's chief public health officer said there were several reasons for optimism -- namely the upcoming summer, and the extremely mild nature of the cases in Canada.</p>
<p>He cautioned that the virus could mutate into a more severe form, as it did in the 1918 pandemic, but that every patient in Canada is making a full recovery so far.</p>
<p>"What gives me short-term optimism is that we are at the end of what would normally be flu season,'' said David Butler-Jones, the chief public health officer.</p>
<p>"So the chances are that this will die down over the summer, assuming that it follows the normal pattern for influenzas, and that we will be in a position to develop a vaccine in the summer . . .</p>
<p>"The second piece of optimism is the cases so far in Canada and the U.S. have been more typical of seasonal -- and mild seasonal flu, not even a severe seasonal flu.''</p>
<p>At the same time the government announced an expanded prevention campaign, which will target mainstream media and social networking sites and emphasize the importance of handwashing, covering sneezes and staying home when sick.</p>
<p>He reminded people to visit www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca] for more information.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper said he's confident that Canadians, while taking the necessary precautions and eyeing developments with a sense of concern, are not getting carried away.</p>
<p>"My sense is the public is, like ourselves, concerned, but I don't sense a panic,'' he said in Edgeley, Sask.</p>
<p>"I sense the public is listening very carefully to various advisories and warnings they are getting and responding appropriately and that's what we encourage.''</p>
<p>Harper was asked about the World Health Organization's decision Thursday to begin referring to the virus by its formal name rather than the more colloquial "swine flu.''</p>
<p>"This is obviously a medical condition so it makes sense to refer to it that way and I gather that's a standard that the World Health Organization is now trying to encourage,'' Harper said.</p>
<p>"The health risks here are to humans; that's the concern . . . It is not the health of the hog industry in any way that is at stake here, so we will encourage that terminology.''</p>
<p>B.C.'s four new cases involved one youngster, one teenager and two adults -- all in the province's Lower Mainland, all mild and all involving people who were either recently in Mexico or in contact with people who were, said Premier Gordon Campbell.</p>
<p>While neither the status nor the number of cases in Canada should be considered cause for alarm, the level of worry surrounding a virus that's fuelling fears of a global pandemic is perfectly justified, Campbell told a news conference.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, we may see some deaths. We have deaths from flu every year. It's important for us to recognize that,'' he said.</p>
<p>Much the same warning came from health officials in Nova Scotia, which is where Canada's first cases of H1N1 came to light last weekend, all of them from a private school where a group of students had recently returned from a school trip to Mexico.</p>
<p>All the new cases are students from the King's Edgehill private school in Windsor, N.S., said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief public health officer.</p>

</p>
<p>Mexico took its status as an international pariah in stride yesterday as the widening spread of H1N1 flu prompted airlines to cancel flights, Catholic priests in Canada to consider touch-free Sunday mass and Mexican officials to trade barbs of blame with the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Hong Kong -- stung badly by the SARS outbreak of 2003 -- reported its first case of H1N1, a Mexican visitor who was in hospital in stable condition, before scrubbing clean the hotel where he'd been staying and quarantining 300 guests and staff.</p>
<p>Chasing the number of confirmed cases worldwide had, by late yesterday, turned into a mug's game. Mexico was no longer including "suspected'' cases in its ongoing tally of infections and deaths, choosing instead to stick to confirmed cases: 343 at last count, including 15 deaths.</p>
<p>The American caseload was up to 149, with a Mexican toddler who died in hospital in the U.S. earlier in the week as the only confirmed fatality beyond Mexico's borders.</p>
<p>There were 13 cases each in Spain and Britain; four each in Germany and New Zealand; two in Israel and France and one each in Switzerland, Austria, China, Denmark and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Indeed, the very name of the virus has become a matter for debate.</p>
<p>WHO officials dropped the term "swine flu'' -- a nickname that angered pork producers and led to a drop in pork sales -- in favour of its scientific name: "H1N1 influenza A.''</p>
<p>The Catholic Archdiocese of Edmonton said it was asking parishes to suspend the use of the common cup to distribute consecrated wine and to encourage parishioners to receive communion in their hands, rather than on the tongue.</p>
<p>And a <span class="companylink">United Airlines</span> flight from Germany was diverted to Boston, on the advice of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after a 53-year-old passenger complained of flu-like symptoms. it was unclear whether she was infected with H1N1.</p>
<p>In Mexico, health officials and the WHO pointed the finger of blame at each other over how long it took last month for forces in both countries to mobilize against the threat of a possible pandemic.</p>
<p>Mexico's chief epidemiologist, Dr. Miguel Angel Lezana, said his centre alerted the Pan American Health Organization, a regional arm of WHO, on April 16 about an unusually late rash of flu and pneumonia cases in Mexico.</p>
<p>He said PAHO took at least 48 hours to notify WHO headquarters, when normally that notification occurs immediately. On April 24 -- the day Canadian and U.S. labs first identified the Mexican cases as swine flu -- WHO announced it was worried the outbreak could become a pandemic.</p>
<p>A PAHO spokesperson, however, said that when Mexico first confirmed an outbreak of acute respiratory infections in the state of Veracruz on April 12, WHO headquarters was notified automatically.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama said it was not clear H1N1 flu was any worse than "ordinary flus.''</p>

<p>InCanada, tourism is suffering its worst downturn since the 2003 SARS outbreak--part of a global trend as people hunker down in the face of economic uncertainty. Add to that the swine flu scare, and we're not going on as many trips. And those we do take are shorter and closer to come. But despite the doom, gloom and shelved plans, there are deals to be had, as travel companies try to lure people back.</p>
<p>Onehotel-- the Westin St. John in the U. S. Virgin Islands--is offering a Layoff Guarantee: Get laid off at least 15 days before you travel, and you can postpone your trip for up to a year.</p>
<p>Last week, Air Canada opened 250,000 extra seats to Aeroplan users ( www.aeroplan.com);BritRail[http://www.aeroplan.com);BritRail] offered one extra day of travel free to BritRail Pass buyers ( www.britrail.com);and[http://www.britrail.com);and] New York City's tourism bureau announced a series of special offers to tourists ( nycgo.com/realdeal).Here's a look at a few other sites to help you take advantage of deals. - <span class="companylink">Farecast</span> ( http://farecast.live.com/),is[http://farecast.live.com/),is] a <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> site that analyzes trends to predict airfare prices. The site's analysis of hotels in the U. S. also has good news. Premium hotels in San Diego, Tampa, New York City, Denver, Chicago and San Francisco, for example, have deeply discounted rates in May and June, with prices on average 27 per cent below 2008 pricing for the same period. <span class="companylink">Farecast</span> is a good starting point for flight and hotel shopping. It searches prices on travel sites and airline sites, then suggests whether prices are likely to fall or rise in the coming days. For hotels, the site tells you whether a hotel's current rate is a deal by comparing it to past prices.</p>
<p>-You may have heard of "staycations" (vacations close to home) and "naycations" (not vacationing at all). Now, a travel site has come up with a new term: "Yaycations," as in, "Yay, now I can actually afford a vacation!"</p>
<p>TravelMuse, a useful travel-planning site, has launched a Yay-cations Calculator. It will help you figure out how much you can save per year by cutting your spending on non-essentials (lattes, restaurant lunches, gadgets, etc.). Check it out at travelmuse.com(look for the Yaycation button). - iStopOver ( www.istopover.com)is[http://www.istopover.com)is] a new Toronto-based site that links travellers looking to save money with people renting out rooms in their homes, or with entire apartments for rent. One thing that keeps some from using such services is uncertainty about the people they're dealing with. To overcome that hurdle, iStopOver uses social-media sites <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and LinkedIn. Before a transaction is completed, the two parties can ask to be allowed to view all or part of the info on the other persons' <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or LinkedIn page. The site, launched last month, currently focuses on Toronto, New York, San Francisco and Boston. - Hotelicopter ( hotelicopter.com)is a new search engine that lets you compare pricing at more than 30 travel sites with one search.</p>

<p>Re: "Too little, too late," Editorial, April 28.</p>
<p>As the Herald's editorial rightly points out, public health must always come ahead of public relations. With swine flu spreading around the globe, it is our shared responsibility to fight this epidemic. SARS is a vivid reminder of how covering up critical epidemic information can lead to deadly consequences. For Taiwan, the situation was more dire. Taiwan was kept out of the loop because it is not a member of the World Health Organization. As a result, the SARS death toll in Taiwan reached 73. Taiwan has applied to participate in the WHO since 1997, only to see the health body block its efforts every year.</p>
<p>Taiwan made a small step forward on April 28 when it received an invitation from WHO secretary general Margaret Chan to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly meeting in May as an observer. It will be a good chance for Taiwan to share its expertise in health care and exchange information with other countries, in the hope that a SARS tragedy will not happen again.</p>

<p>The leader of Edmonton's Catholic Church is asking parishes to temporarily stop using shared communion cups and worshippers to cease shaking hands to protect people from the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"The steps being recommended are precautionary and practical," said Edmonton's Roman Catholic Archbishop Richard Smith in a media statement. "I believe these steps are an appropriate response to the current alert level."</p>
<p>While the guidelines remain optional, Catholic priests are being asked to stop using a common cup during communion, from which parishioners typically sip before the rim is wiped with a cloth.</p>
<p>People are also being asked to receive the communion wafer in their hands rather than directly on the tongue, and to not shake each other's hands during mass, but in-stead bow or nod their heads in greeting. Churches are also being asked to consider having hand sanitizers available.</p>
<p>Anglican churches are taking a slightly different approach, keeping the common communion goblet but asking people not to dip their bread or wafer into the wine, as is sometimes the custom.</p>
<p>Edmonton Anglican Bishop Jane Alexander said studies show that sharing a freshly wiped cup is more sanitary than dipping bread, since people's fingertips sometimes touch the wine surface. Churches are being asked to not use clay cups and to use fresh wiping cloths for every service.</p>
<p>"If you're not feeling well, it's OK to stay home," Alexander said. "We're looking at extra vigilance."</p>

<p>As the number of flu cases in Canada climbed to 51 on Friday--including two new cases in Alberta --the country's chief public health officer expressed optimism the outbreak might turn out to be relatively mild. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization said researchers have cleared the first step toward a vaccine for H1N1.</p>

<p>With its potential to thwart the biggest money-making season for everything from concert tours and blockbuster movies, to theatre productions and festivals, the swine flu looms large over the entertainment industry's summer prospects.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has issued a level-five pandemic alert for the swine flu--one stage below a full-blown pandemic, when a disease is considered common among the general population. If that happens, it could spell trouble for the entertainment business.</p>
<p>"I think a pandemic would have an immediate and profound impact on these industries," said Michael Mulvey, a marketing and social-trends expert at the Telfer School of Management at the University of Ottawa. "I think a considerable segment of people would avoid going to concerts and movie theatres, because most entertainment consumables are elective expenditures.</p>
<p>"You could watch a movie at home, for instance. You don't even have to go to your local Blockbuster store anymore to rent; you can download movies,"Mulvey added. "Home is a sanctuary, a place people fall back to in times of crisis and unease. It happened during the SARS crisis and after 9/11, too, when people avoided public spaces."</p>
<p>The major U. S. movie studios, gearing up for the lucrative summer box-office season, continue to monitor the swine-flu situation in Mexico and the rest of the world. In one week, Paramount's Star Trek is scheduled to open globally, and Warner Brothers' Terminator Salvation is set to hit theatres May 20. Meanwhile, 20th Century Fox has already postponed the Wednesday premiere of X-Men Origins: Wolverine in Mexico City, and delayed the theatrical opening scheduled for Friday, just as the Mexican government asked residents to stay at home, closing schools and the country's movie theatre chains. The Mexican release of Star Trek has also been delayed, while <span class="companylink">Sony</span> has reportedly pushed back two of the country's opening dates: the Da Vinci Code sequel Angels&Demons from May 15 to June 12, and Terminator Salvation from June 5 to July 31.</p>
<p>"We have been closely monitoring the situation in Mexico all week," <span class="companylink">Sony</span> spokesperson Steve Elzer told E! News.</p>
<p>If the measures taken in Mexico City to curb public gatherings are expanded elsewhere, it could be problematic for film-release schedules.</p>
<p>"From the movie studios' perspective, it would be a big deal to shift release dates, because the blockbusters are synchronized worldwide and run on a really tight schedule,"Mulvey said.</p>
<p>In the case of concert promoters, he said he hopes they're well-insured, noting the large cost involved in tours. "But to some extent, they have to accept responsibility for their patrons; it's a human right,"Mulvey added. "And they don't want to put their customers at risk, because they want them to be there for the future."</p>
<p>One movie box-office expert said it's too early to predict the consequences of a swine-flu scare.</p>
<p>"Certainly, something like this isn't positive for the industry in general--or any business in general that requires people to go outside the home," said Paul Dergarabedian of Media by Numbers, the box-office tracking company.</p>
<p>Dergarabedian says people are being cautious and washing their hands more, but added, "I think when Star Trek or Wolverine opens, I'd be really surprised if the hard-core fans, or even just the audience that would flock to a movie like that, would suddenly not want to go because of that. I just don't see that happening. Just try to keep Wolverine fans or Star Trek fans away from the movie theatre."</p>
<p>The flu has already had an effect on at least one North American concert. According to Delaware-Online.com, a show by rappers Young Jeezy and Drake at the University of Delaware was called off after at least 10 students on the school's campus were suspected to be carrying the virus.</p>
<p>And what might happen to fans who've already bought tickets?</p>
<p>"For people who've already doled out money for upcoming events, such as the Bob Dylan and Fleetwood Mac concerts, you have to decide: Should you stay or should you go? Are you in the infection's target group?How contagious is it?" Mulvey said.</p>
<p>"People learn to manage risk. There was a lot of hyper-sensationalism with West Nile Virus, but it didn't stop people from camping and boating. They just get smarter and more proactive to protect themselves."</p>

swine flu.

<p>- I guess shame is one of the things a ShamWoW can't pick up.</p>
<p>- It was ridiculous for the Catholic school board to order its students home from Los Angeles because of the swine flu. If California students had been ordered home from Edmonton because of the SARS outbreak in Toronto, people here would be outraged.</p>
<p>- The media sure can hype everything regarding swine flu. There is no hype for the 36,000 people who actually die from the "regular" flu in the U.S. every year.</p>
<p>- Health Minister Ron Liepert says, "No cause for alarm" -- as if anyone would believe anything he says.</p>
<p>- I wonder if Liepert would still think cancelling field trips was premature if someone from his family became sick.</p>
<p>- Only a knucklehead would make the decisions Liepert makes. I cannot understand why our spineless premier goes along with them.</p>
<p>- The chiropractic benefit was only $200 a year, doled out at $14 per visit, so slightly more than once a month. For someone like myself who had to go twice a week for almost a year, it's hardly worth complaining about losing the benefit. You don't know how much you need a chiropractor until you need one.</p>
<p>- It is an excellent idea to create a provincial savings bond. This is a great opportunity to invest in our own province.</p>
<p>- I love living in a province where the most pressing headlines are mismatched photos and leaked memos that are eventually recanted.</p>
<p>- If Ralph Klein was in charge of the Somalia pirate issue, it would be solved with his shoot, shove (overboard) and shut-up policy.</p>
<p>- I did not vote Conservative and I don't apologize for it. And I promise I won't vote Conservative next time, either.</p>
<p>- I support the Harper government's plan to appeal the court order to repatriate Omar Khadr. It's a no-brainer to uphold the principle of the nation being run by an elected government accountable to voters instead of by a cabal of non-elected activist judges.</p>

<p>- Now that they can't call our homes to bug us, the solicitors coming to our door seem to be increasing.</p>
<p>- The free-flow lane where Terwillegar Drive meets the northbound Whitemud is one kilometre long. Why would anyone stop dead right at the start of that lane and try to force their way over?</p>

</div><div>Paula Simons   </div>

<div>2890 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>It's about 2:15 on a cold and sleety Sunday afternoon in April, and at the Northeast Health Centre's emergency department, some two dozen people -- about half of them patients; the rest, worried friends and relatives -- are sitting in the waiting room.</p>
<p>This isn't a full service hospital. It's more of a super-duper public health clinic and primary care centre. There are no operating theatres here, no ward beds for admitted patients. But the Centre (near Manning Drive and 50th Street) does have a full-fledged emergency department, the only one in the city's northeast quadrant.</p>
<p>Sunday afternoons and evenings, when medicentres and doctors' offices are closed, it's busy here.</p>
<p>But for the attractive blonde woman -- young, but a little heavy-set, who's just come up to the triage desk -- there's no waiting. She complains of trouble breathing, a feeling of heaviness in her chest. Suddenly, she's whisked straight through. Suspected heart attack.</p>
<p>"Welcome to my world," says Dr. Raj Sherman, M.D. -- and MLA. "We're in the life-and-death business here. This is where we translate political mumbo-jumbo into real language." Weekdays, Sherman is the rookie Conservative member for Edmonton-Meadowlark, and parliamentary assistant to Health and Wellness Minister Ron Liepert. Sundays, he's still pulling shifts as an emergency doctor, working both at the Northeast Health Centre and at the Royal Alexandra Hospital.</p>
<p>For the next nine hours, Sherman will be diagnosing and treating bad backs and broken limbs, sore throats and ear aches, infections and drug addictions, suspected heart attacks and possible brain tumours.</p>
<p>In most shifts, he sees between 20 and 25 patients.</p>
<p>"In the emergency department, we handle the illnesses of society. Homelessness. Addiction. Mental illness. Poverty. Violence. At the end of the day, the world's problems go to the emergency department." Patients become impatient For most of us, a trip to emergency is like a foretaste of Dante's Inferno. There is nothing more stressful than rushing to the hospital -- whether you're there for yourself or a family member -- and then waiting and waiting and waiting for uncomfortable, anxious hours just to get to see a doctor. When we're sick or injured, when someone we love is in pain or distress, we want care fast.</p>
<p>But in the emergency department, there are strict rules and hierarchies. If you're dying -- or if you might be dying -- you go first. If you're not in imminent danger, you may have to wait -- no matter how great your pain, your illness, or your fear. Everyone gets graded on a scale of one to six. Ones and twos go to the head of the queue. Everyone else marks time.</p>
<p>Lynn Chorley is a veteran registered nurse and the manager of this emergency department. She knows the waiting can be frustrating. But right now, she's got only two doctors on duty -- a third will come on in a couple of hours, to cope with the evening rush. Even though she has emergency beds sitting empty, her team is moving people along as fast as they can.</p>
<p>"It's so subjective," she says. "You're sitting in the waiting room, but you don't know what's wrong with anyone else and you don't know how we make our decisions." It's 2:45 and Sherman is looking after Mr. G, a good-humoured 40-year-old fellow from Newfoundland, who's come in with a nasty leg infection. Sherman prescribes intravenous antibiotics. Mr. G, who installs light fixtures, then asks about his nasty neck pain. Sherman examines him, asks questions, determines that this is a muscle problem and prescribes ice packs, heat, ibuprofen and massage.</p>
<p>Mr. G tells me he lives near the Northeast Health Centre. This emergency department is where he comes for pretty much all his medical care.</p>
<p>"I like this hospital. They have very polite doctors and it's easy to get to see someone." Sherman, meanwhile, pops into the next room to meet Mr. Y, a handsome man in his 20s with a bodybuilder's toned physique. Mr. Y has come in complaining of severe abdominal pain, bad heartburn, chronic constipation, dark stools and sudden weight loss. He drinks six litres of water a day and smokes two packs of cigarettes a day. And both his parents are diabetic.</p>
<p>"We've got to check a whole lot of things on you," the doctor says. He does a thorough exam, then orders a battery of tests to check for diabetes and blood loss, and tells Mr. Y to expect a long wait. The results will take awhile.</p>
<p>Next up is Mrs. J, a middle-aged woman with pains in her chest and arm, a wheezy cough, night sweats, difficulty breathing. She works at the Alberta legislature -- but she doesn't recognize Sherman in his green hospital scrubs.</p>
<p>"I smoke a pack a day," she tells him. "I've smoked all my life." Sherman's particularly concerned when Mrs. J tells him her mother had a heart attack in her 50s.</p>
<p>"Your EEC looks good, but there's a chance you could have had a small heart attack," he says. He orders a series of blood tests to tell for sure. One will be done immediately, the other at 9 p.m. That means Mrs. J, like Mr. Y, will be taking up a bed for hours -- which means a longer wait for the people still outside.</p>
<p>But Sherman sees no option.</p>
<p>"It's better to deal with patients like this while they're still sitting up and smiling," he says. "She's just a heart attack waiting to happen." Online records a 'godsend' Sherman then heads to the computer to check Mr. Y's medical records: his previous blood test results, his previous diagnoses. All his hospital visits and lab tests are accessible online.</p>
<p>Sherman can hardly wait until records from doctors' offices are added to the system. He knows critics have raised security concerns about the privacy of patient health records, but remains convinced that access to detailed health records saves endless time and makes accurate diagnoses far more likely.</p>
<p>"For us, it's an absolute godsend." It's about 3:30, and Sherman's next patient is a well-tanned blonde who's just returned from Cabo San Lucas with flu symptoms. This is the first case of suspected swine flu that Sherman has dealt with, and Chorley stops him to go over the proper infection protocol.</p>
<p>"Have you got your mask? Has it been fit-tested?" she asks.</p>
<p>Like a sheepish kid, Sherman pulls a grey and crumpled mask from the bottom of his bag. Chorley rolls her eyes and gets him a clean new one, then checks the fit to make sure it's on properly. He puts on a gown and gloves, then heads to the bed, where the woman is waiting behind a curtain. She tells him she's got a bad sore throat and sinus headache, that's she's short of breath, that she's been coughing up blood-tinged green phlegm, that she's had chills, though not a high fever.</p>
<p>She's sick. But is it swine flu? Sherman orders a chest X-ray, then makes a few frustrating attempts to get through to the national flu centre in Winnipeg for more information. He calls repeatedly, but he can't get through on the line.</p>
<p>The technician who's trained to do the nasal phyrangeal swab to test for swine flu isn't on shift.</p>
<p>Sherman and Chorley debate the need to call her in.</p>
<p>"I can do it myself," says Sherman. She looks at him dubiously.</p>
<p>"Have you ever done one before?" They call in the tech.</p>
<p>What are you worried about?' That's Sherman's magic question, one he poses to almost every patient. It's effective. Most patients stop merely listing symptoms and start talking about what frightened them enough to brave the ER.</p>
<p>By 5 p.m., there's been a complete turnover. All the patients who were in the waiting area at 2 p.m. have now been seen. Most waited three or four hours. But the room has filled right up again. "Now it's just bonkers," says Sherman.</p>
<p>He sees a flurry of patients in the next few hours. No car crashes, no major traumas. No patients are in acute crisis. But few of them have relationships with family doctors. This emergency department seems to be their only point of access to the health-care system, and weekends are when they come in for care.</p>
<p>The biggest reason local emergency rooms are so full, he says, is that people have nowhere else to turn.</p>
<p>"We don't have enough family doctors. That means people don't get primary health care, and they end up here. The emphasis needs to be on primary care, in the community. The emergency departments in the U.K. are empty. You know why? A massive investment in community care." Doctors aren't the whole answer, he says. The health-care system also has to make better use of nurses, nurse-practitioners, nutritionists, occupational therapists, pharmacists and other professionals.</p>
<p>"We need more doctors, we need more nurses, we need more front-line staff, and we've got to use them all more efficiently. We need people to do bedside work, we need people who are going to see a lot of patients, because there are a lot of patients to be seen," he says. "Too many times, we have the wrong patient in the wrong place with the wrong health-care worker." Another problem he sees is with the way we use hospital beds. Patients get stalled in the emergency room because acute-care beds are so full, there's no place to put newly admitted patients. Yet up until last month, says Sherman, the Edmonton region's hospitals didn't discharge patients on weekends, even if they were well enough to go home. In fact, he says, hospitals were really only discharging four-and-a-half days a week. When Stephen Duckett took over as CEO of Alberta Health Services, he says, that quickly changed.</p>
<p>"It's not an access problem; it's an exit problem. People who could go home, should go home," he says. "When Duckett got here he asked, 'Are you guys discharging seven days a week? Let's look at that as issue No. 1.' " Next up, diagnosing Mr. Y, the young fellow with the belly pain. His tests are back, and they show no indication of diabetes or blood loss. Sherman asks a few more questions. It turns out that Mr. Y, who works in construction, is on heavy daily doses of narcotics to deal with tight back muscles -- he's taking both OxyContin and Percocet, and sometimes Tylenol with codeine. The drugs, Sherman tells him, explain his constipation as well as some of his other symptoms. But stopping suddenly, he says, will actually cause severe bone pain. He advises Mr. Y to taper off gradually, to go to AADAC for help with his addiction. His firm tone seems persuasive -- but he hasn't got time tonight to get to the heart of Mr. K's problem.</p>
<p>It's 6:00 p.m., and the next problem is a simpler one to fix. Fatima, aged eight, holds her sore arm stiffly by her side. She and her little sister were wrestling on the bed when Fatima fell off. Fatima's dad, an immigrant from Somalia, doesn't speak a lot of English, so Sherman, the son of immigrant parents himself, talks to the bright third-grader. He takes her to a computer screen, so she can see her own X-ray.</p>
<p>"This is your ulna, and this is your radius," he shows her. "You know what? I think you broke your elbow!" He sends the girl off to get a half-cast and a sling, and tells her father to return to the centre's day clinic for followup.</p>
<p>At 6:15, Sherman finally gets the test results back for the attractive young blonde with the heavy chest and breathing troubles. Her heart is fine, but she has severe pneumonia. Still, Sherman doesn't send her home. "I'm not in a rush to send her anywhere. We may have to admit her to hospital. If I send her home now, she may be back in two hours." No time to even eat It's 6:30. Sherman takes a minute to pop his dinner -- penne and steamed vegetables -- into the microwave. He then promptly forgets to eat it -- heading off instead to examine a woman with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or MSRA, the so-called superbug, who's suffering post-op complications from an infected abscess incision. Then he checks the test results for the suspected swine-flu patient, determines she's got a basic sinus infection, and sends her home with antibiotics.</p>
<p>It isn't easy, he admits, trying to defend government policy and funding decisions to his medical colleagues, trying to explain the needs of the system to his fellow politicians.</p>
<p>"I'm pig in the middle." At 7:30, Sherman finally eats his lukewarm penne, while catching up on backlogged medical charts.</p>
<p>"This is my break. Dinner and charting," he grins.</p>
<p>His inability to keep up with his paperwork is a standing joke with his colleagues.</p>
<p>"As a rule, we don't talk politics here," he says. "And they still breathe down my neck if I get behind." As if on cue, Chorley comes up behind him. "We do need to step it up a bit," she says. "We're absolutely full at the moment, and we've got 11 more in the waiting room." "See?" says the junior health minister. "Around here, she's still my boss." So at 7:35, he grabs a handful of patient charts and heads off again.</p>
<p>Four-year-old Carlos has been waiting four hours for someone to treat his tummy ache; Carlos and his family are refugees from Colombia. There, his father was a doctor. Here, he is struggling to learn enough English to pass the exams that he needs to get a medical licence. Sherman respectfully listens to the father's diagnosis of the little boy's infection, examines the child, concurs and writes a prescription. He takes a moment to talk to the father about his education options, then stops by the department toy cupboard. Carlos leaves, all smiles, with a small plastic cellphone, and two sheets of stickers.</p>
<p>By 8 p.m., Sherman's in the ophthalmology room. His patient, a pipefitter, has a red and swollen eye.</p>
<p>"You've got something in there," says Sherman, looking through a magnifying viewer. He quickly freezes the eye with drops, then becomes uncharacteristically silent, focused intently on removing a tiny fleck of metal from the cornea with a needle. The patient, who sat calmly while Sherman cleaned his eyeball, only becomes antsy when the doctor tells him to come back in a few days for a followup. He works from 4:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., he says. He has no time.</p>
<p>It's a constant refrain among these patients, many of whom are working long, hard hours. No one has time to see a doctor. The emergency room sees the fallout.</p>
<p>"People are very stoic. They're Albertans," say Sherman. "Albertans suck it up until the end of the week. They wait until Friday or Saturday evening, and by then they're really sick. Maybe if they came right away they might just need a $28 antibiotic, but instead, they end up in hospital with a serious infection." By 9:15 p.m., Sherman has seen about 20 people. He'll see a few more this shift, but now he's also got to make some decisions. The blonde pneumonia patient eventually goes home. Mrs. J, the lady from the legislature, goes home too, with a nitroglycerin spray and lots of advice on recognizing the symptoms of a heart attack. He calls the emergency departments at the Royal Alex and the University of Alberta hospitals, but both are extremely quiet, with only two or three people waiting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are still 16 sick and worried patients in the Northeast waiting room. "Most of the people here need to be seen," says Sherman. "Maybe they don't all need to be seen in a hospital, but they need to be seen by someone." But if an emergency department is hell for those who wait, it's obvious that for the parliamentary secretary for health and wellness, spending time here, in the thick of things, is an emotional necessity. "In politics, things are glacial," he says. "Here, we actually get things done." psimons@thejournal.canwest.com twitter.com/Paulatics</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu curtails communion customs; Catholic, Anglican archbishops urge changes to prevent transmission</b>
</div><div>Jodie Sinnema   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>806 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>The leader of Edmonton's Catholic church is asking parishioners to temporarily stop sharing communion cups and shaking hands, to protect people from swine flu.</p>
<p>The Anglican bishop issued similar guidelines Friday, the same day Alberta recorded its first case of the H1N1 virus not contracted in Mexico, by a middle-aged Calgary woman who travelled to Tennessee.</p>
<p>One other new case was diagnosed in a young woman in Calgary who recently returned from a trip to Mexico. Both had mild symptoms and are recovering at home, similar to the previous six cases in Alberta.</p>
<p>Expect to see more cases of people catching swine flu from others in the province, and fewer cases linked to travel to Mexico or elsewhere, said Dr. Andre Corriveau, medical officer of health for Alberta.</p>
<p>Churches are doing their part to prevent transmission.</p>
<p>"The steps being recommended are precautionary and practical," Edmonton Catholic Archbishop Richard Smith said in a statement. "I believe these steps are an appropriate response to the current alert level." While the guidelines remain optional, Catholic priests are being asked to stop using common cups during communion, from which parishioners typically sip before the rim is wiped with a cloth.</p>
<p>People are also being asked to receive the communion wafer in their hand rather than directly on their tongue, and to not shake hands, but bow or nod in greeting. Churches should also consider having hand sanitizers available.</p>
<p>Anglican churches are taking a slightly different approach, keeping the common communion goblet, but asking people not to dip their bread or wafer into the wine, as is sometimes the custom.</p>
<p>Edmonton Anglican Bishop Jane Alexander said studies show that sharing a freshly wiped cup is more sanitary than dipping bread, since people's fingertips sometimes touch the wine's surface. Churches are being asked not to use clay cups, and to use fresh wiping cloths for every service.</p>
<p>"If you're not feeling well, it's OK to stay home," Alexander said. "We're looking at extra vigilance." Corriveau said the churchly advice makes sense.</p>
<p>"Whether you're going to a church service or a party with your friends, if you have a flu-like illness, you shouldn't be sharing cups and you should be using etiquette," he said.</p>
<p>He asked for calm from businesses who are sending employees, whether sick or not, to get tests if they had travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>"We're appealing for people to be reasonable, to not clog our health-care system unnecessarily with these kinds of demands," Corriveau said, noting that even family members of the eight people with the flu aren't getting antivirals such as Tamiflu to ward off the illness.</p>
<p>Giving out too much preventive medication can actually spark drug resistance and flu mutation.</p>
<p>"If people are symptomatic and taking appropriate precautions, there is no problem with the fact that people have travelled to Mexico." Corriveau said this flu strain is quite mild and benign compared to other strains. He didn't offer any opinion on the decisions by Edmonton Catholic and public school boards to ban air travel and international trips.</p>
<p>But Craig Sobat, whose son was set to fly to England with his Grade 9 Westminster Junior High class on May 16, said the decision was rash and ill-informed.</p>
<p>"I'm mostly concerned for the kids, because they've worked very hard at this," Sobat said.</p>
<p>He said each family is also losing more than $3,000. Altogether, the trip cost more than $60,000 to send 24 students and three teachers on a Shakespearean trip to Stratford, Sobat said.</p>
<p>"We have no chance of getting our money back, either from the travel agency or the school board." He wants the Edmonton Public School Board to reverse its decision before trustees meet to discuss the issue at a regularly scheduled board meeting on May 12.</p>
<p>"I think the superintendent of schools has made a big mistake here," Sobat said. "You can catch the flu anytime of the year, anywhere in the world." Board spokeswoman Jane Farrell said the decision to ban travel was difficult, but involved advice from experts, including two nurses in occupational health and safety who have expertise in pandemic planning.</p>
<p>"It's about the safety of the students," Farrell said. "It had nothing to do with liability." She said the decision was made because a group of four high school students and three teachers were heading to Mexico today to help build a family home. The group cancelled their own trip before the superintendent expanded it.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Scientists face critical decision on producing swine-flu vaccine: start now, or wait and see; Developing a new vaccine now could interfere with work on seasonal-flu antivirals</b>
</div><div>Mohammed Adam   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>676 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>With the World Health Organization saying that containing the outbreak of swine flu is no longer possible, global public health officials face a dilemma as they turn their attention to the production of a new vaccine against a potential pandemic.</p>
<p>The seasonal flu vaccine is normally ready for final approval in August, and distributed shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>The typical flu season lasts from November to April.</p>
<p>But with the new H1N1 flu spreading quickly, scientists at WHO and around the world, must decide whether work should begin on a new seasonal-flu vaccine now or whether they should wait and see if a pandemic really hits.</p>
<p>Beginning the process of producing a new vaccine now could interfere with the work now under way on seasonal flu, which kills tens of thousands worldwide.</p>
<p>Margaret Chan, the director general of the WHO, alerted manufacturers this week to the potential need for a pandemic vaccine, but she said there was no reason now to stop the production of seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Dr. Allan Ronald, scientific adviser to the International Centre for Infectious Diseases in Winnipeg, said scientists have been so focused on dealing with the outbreak, no one has had time to think through all the scenarios of how a new flu vaccine should be developed.</p>
<p>He noted that no flu epidemic in North America has lasted beyond May and it is likely this current outbreak will wane and then return during the next flu season.</p>
<p>That will give scientists time to develop a new vaccine.</p>
<p>"It is always a gamble trying to figure out what we need to protect people from and coming up with the right vaccine. My sense would be that the effort would likely be to include the new strain in whatever is thought to be circulating that will be around next October-November and just combine it all."</p>
<p>Canada has a contract with pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> to produce two million doses of new vaccine a week, at the company's Ste-Foy, Que., plant.</p>
<p>The plan is to produce enough vaccine for all Canadians.</p>
<p>Until the vaccine is available -- something that could take up to six months -- Canada will use its stock of 50 million doses of antivirals as the first line of defence if the first wave of a pandemic strikes.</p>
<p>About 90 per cent of the stock is Tamiflu, with Relenza making up the rest. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of Tamiflu, for instance, but Canadian officials remain confident it will work.</p>
<p>Even so, antivirals arrest the progress of the new flu virus in the body only if administered in the 48 hours after symptoms appear.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> said earlier this week that it was in touch with the WHO, Canada and governments across the globe to determine their needs.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada says no work has begun on a vaccine because not enough is known about the makeup of the H1N1 strain to give scientists sufficient ammunition to begin work on a vaccine.</p>
<p>Scientists at the National Microbiology Laboratory, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO are busily working to solve the puzzle. The CDC said earlier this week that it had built up a "seed stock" of the virus that could lead to the production of a vaccine.</p>
<p>Once available, the new vaccine will come in batches, and initially, would have to be rationed.</p>
<p>Doctors, nurses, ambulance workers, pharmacists, laboratory technicians and other health workers would get the first shots to prepare them to deal with the sick.</p>
<p>Other emergency responders, such as police and firefighters, would be next in line before the vaccine is administered to the rest of the population.</p>

</p>
<p>AT A GLANCE</p>
<p>World: Several encouraging signs were reported Friday, though scientists warn flu viruses are unpredictable and measures to prevent its spread must continue unabated:</p>
<p>- Worldwide, experts reported a drop in the rate of new cases being reported. The number of new suspected cases in Mexico had dropped to a third of the rate of a few days ago, before widespread banning of public gathering and school closures.</p>
<p>- Experts at the U.S. Centres for Disease Control had three pieces of encouraging news. They said Mexico's outbreak may not be as severe as it looked at first, because many mild cases were not immediately noticed -- and that means the real death rate is much lower than feared. They also said the new virus lacks traits that made the 1918 flu pandemic so deadly, including missing a key protein. And they said initial analysis suggests developing a vaccine to include in regular seasonal flu shots this fall should be a routine matter.</p>
<p>A senior World Health Organization official said the world health agency is in negotiations with a "few dozen" manufacturers worldwide to arrange production of a vaccine, although she cautioned it could take four to six months for the first doses to be produced. Researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other research centres worldwide, including Canada, are currently "tweaking" the virus so samples can be turned into a vaccine, a process that should conclude in mid- to late May.</p>
<p>- Mexican scientists studying the virus report its ability to spread from person to person is "fairly low" and no more infectious than normal seasonal flu, giving them hope that they can better contain its spread.</p>
<p>DEVELOPMENTS</p>
<p>Mexico: Mexican public hospitals that treat roughly half the country admitted just 46 patients with severe flu symptoms on Thursday, down from 212 patients on April 20. Much of Mexico shut down until next Wednesday to help battle the outbreak, and the government threatened stiff fines for non-essential businesses that ignored the closure order. Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said the confirmed toll now stood at 15 dead and 328 people infected, as lab tests came through from hundreds of backlogged cases. The suspected death toll, 176, remained unchanged from Thursday. All the confirmed deaths were in, or close to, Mexico City.</p>
<p>Canada: The number of cases of human swine flu in Canada climbed to 51, with 17 new cases. Federal authorities unveiled a flu prevention information campaign including advertising, handouts for travellers and a 1-800 number where Canadians can get advice. 1--800-454-8302 is available seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern. A national website is also available: www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca]. The Catholic Archdiocese of Edmonton is asking its parishes to temporarily stop using shared communion cups and is encouraging worshippers to nod their heads instead of shaking hands during Mass in order to protect people from the swine flu.</p>
<p>- An Ipsos Reid poll suggests most Canadians are staying calm. Fewer than half of those surveyed, 47 per cent, said they are "somewhat" or "very much"concerned, while 81 per cent said they had confidence in the government response.</p>
<p>U.S.: The U.S. crossed the 150 mark Friday morning, as new cases were reported in Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee, bringing the total to 151. About 400 schools have now been closed nationwide, 300 of them in Texas and 62 in Alabama. The two states have also cancelled high school athletic events for the time being.</p>
<p>China: Hong Kong reported a confirmed case in a traveller returning from Mexico.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>2010 Games officials watching flu closely, but see no cause for alarm; Strain could sweep across Canada over 12 to 18 months, government document states</b>

</p>
<p>Canada's national pandemic plan suggests the Vancouver 2010 Olympics could be side-swiped by the looming global flu epidemic.</p>
<p>If swine flu, which is slowly infecting people in many countries, is declared a pandemic strain -- and the World Health Organization believes that to be "imminent" -- it would sweep across this country in waves of illness over 12 to 18 months, according to The Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan for the Health Sector, the massive government document intended to guide the nation through such an emergency.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Games are set for Feb. 12 to Feb. 28. The Vancouver Organizing Committee was silent Friday when asked about the potential situation. But Dr. Patricia Daly, chief medical officer of health for the Vancouver Coastal Health Agency, was quick to note that the last flu pandemic, in 1968, coincided with the Summer Olympics in Mexico City.</p>
<p>"We don't think this is going to have an impact on the Games, but of course, we're monitoring the situation," she said. "If a pandemic is declared, the Olympics is months away, we would anticipate we would have a vaccine available before the Olympics occur," and that staff, who are to receive regular flu shots anyway, also would get a pandemic shot.</p>
<p>What's more, even if a pandemic is declared, the virus could be mild, no worse than the annual flu bug,</p>
<p>"Why would we cancel public events?" Daly said. "We don't do that during a regular flu season."</p>
<p>Influenza viruses are notoriously unpredictable and the authors of the government plan stress their assumptions, based on a pandemic of moderate severity, should not be interpreted as predictions for the next pandemic, but rather a reflection of current opinion regarding a reasonable scenario to guide planning activities.</p>
<p>"The impact of the next influenza pandemic is difficult to predict. It depends on how virulent the virus is, how rapidly it spreads from population to population, and the effectiveness of prevention and response efforts," says the paper.</p>
<p>It assumes the first pandemic wave will sweep across the country in one to two months, affecting multiple locations simultaneously. The first peak of illness could occur within two to four months after the virus arrives and the first peak in deaths is expected about a month later.</p>
<p>There are expected to be two or more waves of illness, each expected to last six to eight weeks. Subsequent waves could wash over the country in relatively quick succession,</p>
<p>Even if a full-blown pandemic does arrive, Mexican H1N1 could fizzle after a relatively short, mild run or blaze around the globe.</p>
<p>No one knows.</p>

<p>Premier Gordon Campbell joined public health officials in asking for calm and vigilance Friday as the number of confirmed cases of the H1N1 swine flu in B.C. rose to 15, including that of a student at Killarney secondary.</p>
<p>All the cases have been mild, and while Campbell noted that there are likely to be more cases -- and possibly deaths -- he reminded the public that deaths are normal in any flu season.</p>
<p>"It is important to be vigilant, but not fearful," he said.</p>
<p>Pupils at an elementary school near Burns Lake were dismissed early Friday after the region's medical health officer became concerned about the high number of absent students reporting flu symptoms.</p>
<p>But Killarney secondary is not closing its doors, despite the fact that one of its students has tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Killarney principal Jill Phillipchuk said in an interview that the boy caught the virus from a relative who recently travelled to Mexico. The student has been voluntarily staying home from school.</p>
<p>In a letter sent home to school parents Friday afternoon, John Carsley, medical health officer for the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, said anyone exposed to the student would have become sick by Thursday.</p>
<p>"The student is recovering well at home. We feel the risk to others at school is very low," Carsley wrote. "There is no need to close the school at this time."</p>
<p>None of the students at the school near Burns Lake -- Decker Lake elementary -- has tested positive for the virus, but swabs have been sent for testing. Ernie Mannering, a representative of the school district, said the school will likely be open on Monday.</p>
<p>"The health authority is pretty confident it's regular flu, but they are testing as a precautionary measure," Mannering said.</p>
<p>An elementary school in Vernon closed Thursday after a student there tested positive for the virus. It will be closed for at least a week as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>Of the four new cases of H1N1 announced Friday, three are secondary cases, meaning those who fell ill had not travelled to Mexico, but were infected by someone who had.</p>
<p>Only one person with the virus has been hospitalized, and that was for one night. Everyone with the virus is either fully recovered or recovering well.</p>
<p>Campbell and B.C.'s health officials continue to urge people to stay home if they have a fever or cough, and to dial 811 -- HealthLink BC -- if they want advice from a health services professional. "There's no need to rush to an emergency room," Campbell said.</p>
<p>For those who feel the need to see a doctor, the advice is to call ahead so preparations can be made by the doctor's office to minimize infection to other people.</p>

<p>Some experts have speculated that the current swine-flu outbreak might have originated with animal waste in a factory farm. Its H1N1 type virus is nearly identical to that of the Spanish flu, which killed more than 50 million people in 1918-19.</p>
<p>We can all help prevent the development and spread of these killer diseases by replacing animal products in our diet with healthful vegetables, fresh fruits, and whole grains. These foods don't carry deadly microbes (unless contaminated by animal waste), are touted by every major health advocacy organization, and were the recommended fare in the Garden of Eden.</p>

<p>International. Vienna top quality city, Ottawa 19th in world</p>
<p>Vienna has beaten Zurich to be crowned the place in the world with the best quality of living in an annual survey in which European cities dominated the top 10. The Swiss city of Zurich came third and Vancouver and Auckland, New Zealand shared fourth, according to management consultancy Mercer, which carried out the 215-city survey. Toronto finished 15th and Ottawa 19th while Honolulu was top U.S. city at 29th. Washington finished 44th and New York 49th.</p>
<p>Australia. Politician standing tall after bone-stretching</p>
<p>An Australian politician has written a book -- God Made Me Small, Surgery Made Me Tall -- in which she admits to having bone-stretching surgery eight years ago to become taller. A happy Hajnal Ban, who increased her height to 162 cm from 154 cm, said she had the means to be taller and took it. "This is no different to having breast augmentation or nose procedures," she said.</p>
<p>Congo. Traffickers foiled in bid to smuggle baby gorilla</p>
<p>Congo officials have saved a rare baby gorilla from traffickers at an airport. The animal had been hidden under clothes in the bottom of a bag, wildlife officials say. The two-year-old female was rescued in the eastern Congolese town of Goma following a three-month undercover investigation. Suffering from overheating and dehydration, it is being cared for by local veterinarians. One suspected trafficker has been arrested.</p>
<p>Russia. Car thieves beware, leopard in trunk</p>
<p>The owner of a rare species of leopard says thieves who stole his car in St. Petersburg are in for a surprise. There is a baby leopard in the truck. "My driver and I were in the process of settling the leopard in the trunk of my Mercedes ... when three masked assailants attacked us. They managed to get away with the car," said Mikhail Barakin who is offering more than $90,000 U.S. for the return of his Asian Leopard Cat. Barakin says he is more worried about the $350,000 U.S. cat than his Mercedes sport-utility vehicle. "If someone returns the animal, I won't press charges (over the car)," he says.</p>
<p>China. Michelle Obama lifts Chinese shoemaker</p>
<p>A Chinese shoe manufacturer is thrilled that U.S. first lady Michelle Obama is being widely hailed as a style icon for the 21st century. Reoblan Footwear Co Ltd is working overtime to churn out the high-heeled Bandolino Berry, which Obama has been photographed wearing this year. Reoblan has received a three-month order of 200,000 pairs from its U.S. partner and outs it down to the seal of approval given by the trend-setting wife of U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>United States. TV pushes away loneliness: study</p>
<p>Watching television might not make you happy, but for some viewers it beats being alone. U.S. researchers have found that watching TV can drive away feelings of loneliness and rejection. One study shows people feel less lonely when watching favourite TV shows. Another revealed viewers whose "belongingness needs were aroused" wrote longer essays about their favoured TV programs.</p>
<p>Movie duo expecting twins via surrogate</p>
<p>Sex and the City actress Sarah Jessica Parker and her husband Matthew Broderick are expecting twin girls via a surrogate mother. Parker, 44, and Broderick, 47, "are happily anticipating the birth of their twin daughters later this summer with the generous help of a surrogate. The entire family is overjoyed," a statement from the couple said. They have a six-year-old son, James.</p>
<p>Mexico. How Mexican company may benefit from virus</p>
<p>A rising number of phone calls from Mexicans concerned about the swine flu that has killed about 150 people in the country could be good news for leading telecommunications provider <span class="companylink">Telefonos de Mexico</span>. "I am crossing my fingers. It could be a positive impact for Telmex," chief financial officer Adolfo Cerezo says. The spreading virus is prompting jittery citizens to check on family and friends in the country and abroad.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A flu by any other name; What's the difference between 'H1N1' and 'swine?' Hog sales and risk perception</b>
</div><div>Dan Gardner   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>451 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>The Obama administration wants people to drop "swine flu." They prefer "H1N1 flu."</p>
<p>It would be easy to ridicule this, not least because its origins are so classically Washingtonian. "Swine flu" connects pigs with disease. That's not good if you're in the business of selling pork. So pork producers mobilized an army of lobbyists.</p>
<p>Hence, "H1N1 flu."</p>
<p>And yet, I think the administration is right to push for a name-change, although for an entirely different reason.</p>
<p>As I discuss in my book Risk, heaps of research demonstrates that language influences risk perception.</p>
<p>In particular, two studies found that calling Mad Cow Disease "Mad Cow Disease" instead of the proper name -- "bovine spongiform encephalopathy" or BSE -- significantly elevated people's perceptions of the threat. That's because BSE is cold and abstract. It doesn't create nasty images. It doesn't make emotional connections. And it sounds very science-y -- which encourages people to think more analytically about the risk.</p>
<p>But "mad cow disease"? The term was invented by an editor at the Daily Telegraph who later explained he was frustrated people weren't paying attention to the BSE story. He wanted to elevate concern. Mission accomplished.</p>
<p>"Mad cow disease" conjures nasty images of diseased and dying cows. It's ugly and visceral. It stirs feeling -- bad feeling. Emotion is a major driver of our intuitive sense of risk perception, and thus "mad cow disease" boosted people's intuitive sense of the threat.</p>
<p>Now, go back to "swine flu." It also conjures nasty images of dirty, diseased and dying animals. It has emotional content. It stirs feelings in those who hear it. (Remember that emotions are not only overt feelings like anger or love. Emotions can also be very subtle. We can even experience them unconsciously.) And so it's safe to assume that it, like "mad cow disease," elevates the intuitive perception of the risk.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, that sort of temperature-raising can be helpful. But here, it's not. We're all paying attention. We're all taking it seriously. Here, the danger is over-reaction, not under-reaction. Changing the name of the flu to something coldly scientific would help lower the emotional temperature -- and thus encourage people to think a little more rationally about the risk.</p>
<p>For the record, I have received no payment from pork producers. Though they are welcome to send a cheque, should they be so inclined.</p>
<p>- Dan Gardner ponders the latest news, the human mind and really cool German words on his blog, Katzenjammer.</p>

<p>Gerardo Castillo, a Mexican restaurateur whose establishment in the capital is now only allowed to sell takeout food, looked ruefully across the sea of empty tables Friday.</p>
<p>The fallout was hitting him hard, he said, but he still supported the drastic measures his government was taking to contain the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"The most important thing is that people avoid this infection. In times like these, we have to stand shoulder to shoulder," he said.</p>
<p>Mexico's struggling economy, already the victim of recession and drug wars, has been ordered into a five-day shutdown.</p>
<p>President Felipe Calderon has instructed all offices, restaurants, shops, schools and "non-essential" industries to close, and asked Mexicans to stay home. It's an attempt to flush the flu virus out of the country's system.</p>
<p>Like many Mexicans who fear that the "cure" may be more painful than the virus, Hernan Zuniga, a taxi driver in Mexico City, was angry that the shutdown had reduced his business by about two-thirds.</p>
<p>"This is a real overreaction. The politicians can make these decisions to shut everything down, but they are not the ones who will go hungry with no money," he said.</p>
<p>More than a thousand kilometres away on the coast, thousands of American and European tourists continued to pack the beaches and bars of Cancun, Mexico's biggest resort, without a surgical mask in sight.</p>
<p>Hotel staff were reassuring guests yesterday that -- whatever the rest of the country was doing -- it was business as usual.</p>
<p>Mexico, a land of variety, as it says in the guide books, is certainly proving so in its response to swine flu.</p>
<p>In Cancun -- where a number of the flu's foreign victims, including a Scottish couple, were staying while in Mexico -- hotel occupancy has reportedly fallen by 36 per cent; but those who come are not fazed by health concerns.</p>
<p>At the Oasis Cancun, the hotel where a group of New York high school students were staying just days before coming down with the virus, the party is still in full swing.</p>
<p>A young American woman showed little interest in the risk as she slugged down a cocktail at the bar.</p>
<p>She was breaking all the Mexican government's warnings about not gathering in crowded places, avoiding physical contact and regular handwashing, and she clearly didn't even know it.</p>
<p>Away from the resorts where the locals are doing their level best not to alarm the gringos, there have been widespread signs of a worried population. Mexican hospitals report being inundated by thousands of people concerned they may have the virus.</p>
<p>In the capital, the vigilance of people's precautions has varied considerably from region to region.</p>
<p>In the fashionable middle-class Condesa, almost everyone has been carefully sporting their blue paper surgical face masks.</p>
<p>"I basically stay in my house almost all the time. I don't want to see any of my friends in case they infect me or my son or daughter," said Alejandra Peralta, 37, a single mother who works for the government.</p>
<p>"A friend yesterday said he was going to pop by. I told him that I didn't want him in my home spreading his germs."</p>
<p>But in many working-class barrios, teenagers and young men massed carelessly on the street, laughing, chatting and kicking footballs around.</p>
<p>"I'm not scared of the flu. If it gets me, then it gets me," said Hector Quiros, 27.</p>
<p>Bizarre conspiracy theories -- blaming the U.S., drug cartels or the government -- are circulating to explain why the virus has hit Mexico so much harder than anywhere else.</p>
<p>The country's poor health care system and rudimentary scientific testing facilities have been blamed for delaying for crucial weeks identification of the virus as a new, mutant strain.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old woman who was the first to die spent the last eight days of her life going from clinic to clinic to find out what was wrong with her, but doctors were baffled.</p>
<p>Misinformation is still rife. Hotel management in resorts such as Cancun claim -- misleadingly, given the evidence from abroad -- that the virus hasn't affected their regions, but at the same time some have been issuing masks to kitchen staff.</p>
<p>Hotel staff have clearly been under orders to play down the crisis, ignoring searching questions with a smile. At the Dreams Cancun resort, an Irish honeymooner asked a concierge about the bag of surgical masks on his desk.</p>
<p>The hotel worker mumbled that they were for staff and quickly moved them out of sight, the tourist said.</p>
<p>The hotels are not alone. According to some European holidayers, travel company representatives were dismissing fears over the virus as "hype" earlier this week.</p>
<p>Among hundreds of tourists who lined up on Wednesday for a special flight home, there were angry accusations that travel companies had downplayed the health risks.</p>
<p>"The woman from our tour operator told us, 'Don't take calls from relatives and don't watch the telly'," Briton Denise McCabe said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'No screening' at Pearson after arriving from Mexico, Ottawa woman reports</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>601 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>An Ottawa woman who returned from Mexico this week is raising concerns about what she views as lax passenger screening for the swine flu at Canada's busiest airport.</p>
<p>Coming off a flight from Cancun Thursday night, Leeanne Charlebois said she expected customs officials at Toronto's Pearson International Airport to grill her about any symptoms that could be associated with the swine flu. To her surprise, no one did.</p>
<p>"They were all sitting in their booths with masks and blue gloves on," Charlebois said of the border officials she encountered. "Never asked us where we had been. Never asked us about our health."</p>
<p>Given what she had been led to believe was heightened surveillance at airports, Charlebois said she found it odd that no official inquired about whether she had been in contact with anyone in Mexico who had flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>About the only precautionary measure she encountered was from Mexican authorities, who issued a survey asking passengers to indicate if they had any flu symptoms, said Charlebois.</p>
<p>"My daughter picked me up at the airport and she asked me, 'How did the screening go?' I said, 'There was no screening'," said Charlebois.</p>
<p>"I feel there should at least have been somebody at Canada customs saying, 'How long have you been gone? What area were you at?' You know, tracking us."</p>
<p>According to federal officials, quarantine officers are regularly stationed at the airport to handle anyone who is exhibiting serious symptoms of illness, but no additional screening measures have been implemented since the outbreak.</p>
<p>"Quarantine officers assess ill travellers and work to ensure sick travellers receive the advice and care they need, so that we can protect the public from risk of infection," Josée Bellemare, a spokeswoman for Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, said in a statement.</p>
<p>"In addition, all border officials are trained in how to recognize ill travellers and they are currently screening passengers arriving on direct flights from Mexico."</p>
<p>Charlebois also expressed concern about an apparent lack of information about the swine flu at the Toronto and Ottawa airports. "There were no signs posted anywhere that I could see. They could at least give us some sort of brochure or something."</p>
<p>But Bellemare said information bulletins are being handed out to passengers travelling from Mexico and in-flight announcements are being made.</p>
<p>"Public health messages advising travellers about how to protect themselves are being shown on screens throughout airport terminals across Canada."</p>
<p>More than one million Canadians visit Mexico each year, mostly in the winter, with an estimated 19,000 travelling between the two countries during an average week in April. In recent days, however, major carriers such as Air Canada and WestJet have suspended flights to four key Mexican tourist destinations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ottawa's chief medical officer of health said there are still no confirmed cases of the swine flu in the city, which means health officials have no immediate plans to take additional precautions beyond steps already taken.</p>
<p>Such steps include consulting with their counterparts across the province, mobilizing emergency planners from area hospitals and other health-care providers and ensuring Ottawa residents who travelled to Mexico and came back with flu symptoms are being monitored, said Dr. Isra Levy.</p>
<p>"The main issue of concern that would bring about a change would be if there's true illness in the community and if it spread rapidly," said Levy. "None of those things seem to be an immediate and present risk right now."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Wave of illness could wash over 2010 Games; 1968 pandemic coincided with Mexico Olympics</b>
</div><div>Ian MacLeod   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>912 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Canada's national pandemic plan suggests the Vancouver 2010 Olympics could be sideswiped by the looming global flu epidemic.</p>
<p>If the swine flu that is slowly infecting the world is declared a pandemic strain -- the World Health Organization believes that is "imminent" -- it would sweep across this country in waves of illness over 12 to 18 months, according to The Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan for the Health Sector, the massive government document intended to guide the nation through such an emergency.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Games are set for Feb. 12-28. The Vancouver Organizing Committee was silent Friday when asked about the potential situation. But Dr. Patricia Daly, chief medical officer for Vancouver's health authority, was quick to note that the last flu pandemic, in 1968, coincided with the summer Olympics -- in Mexico City.</p>
<p>"We don't think this is going to have an impact on the Games, but of course we're monitoring the situation," she said in an interview.</p>
<p>"If a pandemic is declared, the Olympics is months away, we would anticipate we would have a vaccine available before the Olympics occur," and that staff, who are to receive regular flu shots anyway, would also get a pandemic shot.</p>
<p>What's more, even if a pandemic is declared, the virus could be mild, no worse than the annual flu bug so, "why would we cancel public events? We don't do that during a regular flu season."</p>
<p>Influenza viruses are unpredictable and the authors of the government plan stress that their assumptions, based on a pandemic of moderate severity, should not be interpreted as predictions for the next pandemic, but rather a reflection of current opinion regarding a reasonable scenario to guide planning activities.</p>
<p>"The impact of the next influenza pandemic is difficult to predict; it depends on how virulent the virus is, how rapidly it spreads from population to population, and the effectiveness of prevention and response efforts," says the paper. It assumes the first pandemic wave will sweep across the country in one to two months affecting multiple locations simultaneously. The first peak of illness could occur within two to four months after the virus arrives and the first peak in deaths is expected about a month later.</p>
<p>There are expected to be two or more waves of illness, expected to last six to eight weeks. Subsequent waves could wash over the country in relatively quick succession, leaving little time for health-care services to recover.</p>
<p>Mexico's government raised its confirmed toll Friday to 15 dead and 328 people infected as it began a five-day shutdown to halt the flu's spread, while more countries confirmed cases on their soil, including 51 in Canada, 15 of those in British Columbia.</p>
<p>Even in a full-blown pandemic, Mexican H1N1 could fizzle after a short, mild run or blaze around the globe killing millions. No one knows. So far, however, it appears to be no more deadly than the flu bugs that strike the Northern Hemisphere every fall and winter, killing upwards of 1,500, mostly older, Canadians.</p>
<p>The estimate on the 12-to-18-month duration of a pandemic is based on analysis of past pandemics including the Spanish flu H1N1 virus of 1918.</p>
<p>All modern pandemics are measured against that catastrophe. Like the swine flu, it targeted people between the ages of 20 and 40, and not the very young and old who typically fall ill to the annual flu bug. As spring turned to summer, the flu waned, but came roaring back that fall.</p>
<p>In September, the Spanish H1N1 virus arrived at 18 Gloucester St. in downtown Ottawa, the home of Jules E. Lemieux, an ailing 72-year-old federal public servant. After a week confined to bed, Lemieux died on Sept. 27, the first recorded local death of the Spanish flu pandemic.</p>
<p>The virus claimed 440 victims in Ottawa that October. Almost 60 per cent were 18 to 35 years old. Some woke in the morning feeling sick and were dead by nightfall. More than 500 people died locally and thousands became gravely ill in the year's final four months.</p>
<p>By the end of the spring of 1919, the Spanish flu had killed 20-million to 40-million people, including 30,000 to 50,000 Canadians. Another 500 million became sick.</p>
<p>In 1957, the Asian flu (H2N2) killed 7,000 Canadians and almost 70,000 Americans, arriving on the continent in May of that year and continuing in a series of small outbreaks over the summer. That September, the infection rate exploded. That outbreak ended in March 1958.</p>
<p>The last pandemic, the 1968 Hong Kong flu (H3N2), caused far more widespread illness than the Asian flu, but was less deadly, killing about 4,000 Canadians. It arrived in North America in September that year, but didn't become widespread until December. Deaths peaked in December and January 1969.</p>
<p>Illness and death in a Canadian pandemic</p>
<p>Estimated number of cases for pandemics of mild to moderate severity based on Canadian population of30,301,180:</p>
<p>Outcome Mild Moderate</p>
<p>Death 17,768 41,459</p>
<p>Hospitalization with recovery 46,639 108,824</p>

</p>
<p>The following editorial appeared first in the (Auckland) New Zealand Herald:</p>
<p>A contributor to our Sideswipe column yesterday probably reflected the views of many readers when he predicted the new strain of H1N1 flu worrying the world would kill as many New Zealanders as have died from terrorism, SARS, bird flu and the millennium bug. In a word, none. "What is it with the media and scaremongering?'' he asked.</p>
<p>It is a fair question, though a brave one when we were awaiting the results of tests -- received last night -- to discover whether 10 Rangitoto College students, who returned from Mexico at the weekend with flu symptoms, have been infected with the influenza A strain that has prompted the worldwide alert. What are news media to do when the World Health Organization issues such a warning and national health authorities want to track those possibly exposed?</p>
<p>The New Zealand Herald does not speak for any media but itself. We take care to use terms that accurately represent the degree of risk that public health professionals assess. . . . Even so, comprehensive coverage of the threat, running to several pages of the paper over consecutive days, can make the emergency appear worse than it yet may be.</p>
<p>But if that is scaremongering, it is singularly ineffective. There is no discernible panic in the community over this potential "pandemic,'' as the WHO calls these outbreaks. ...</p>
<p>Far from panic, the popular response to these scares may be becoming too complacent. . . . When health authorities ring these alarms they have succeeded in ensuring that quarantine measures are taken and adequate stocks of medicine and other needs are quickly provided. That might not happen if announcements of outbreaks of new and deadly diseases were reported as briefly and quietly as critics seem to think they deserve.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>"No news is good news," local medical officer of health Dr. Nicola Mercer said yesterday as she reported not a single confirmed case of swine flu in her coverage area.</p>
<p>That's not to say we're out of the woods.</p>
<p>Mercer, who oversees Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health, said she's monitoring several suspected cases of flu locally, though laboratory test results aren't in yet.</p>
<p>Those tests were sent out at the beginning of the week, but it can take up to 10 days for results to come back, Mercer said.</p>
<p>She further cautioned that these local cases may not prove to be related to the H1N1 flu outbreak spreading across North America and beyond from an epicentre in Mexico.</p>
<p>If they prove to be flu, they could be of the seasonal variety.</p>
<p>This version, which typically strikes in the fall and runs its course for months, circulates annually among populations of people, Mercer explained.</p>
<p>Every year, the ability of this seasonal flu to infect extends into May.</p>
<p>Last year, the flu was still present in June, Mercer said during a daily briefing.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu has complicated matters because it's still not yet clear how many cases in the growing international outbreak are of the new variety and how many of the old, she said.</p>
<p>So the few cases under investigation locally may be H1N1 flu, the seasonal variety or not influenza at all.</p>
<p>"It's challenging."</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Health reported four new cases of H1N1 flu, for a total of 12 Ontario cases.</p>

</p>
<p>A friend of mine is stepping down this summer after leading a large, complex organization for more than a decade.</p>
<p>As the tributes pour in, he is leaving with the confident knowledge that not only did he do a great job and his legacy is one that will influence the organization and the course of events for some time, but that the place is in better shape than when he arrived.</p>
<p>He met recently with a couple hundred of the senior staff and talked about his term as leader. Members of the audience were people he had worked with all these years, and many told me they were touched by what he had to say.</p>
<p>Here is the advice he offered to leaders:</p>
<p>Set the direction and vision for what you want to achieve early.</p>
<p>Build your team.</p>
<p>Use your voice.</p>
<p>Keep in touch with people and seek their advice</p>
<p>Stay the course.</p>
<p>Keep your eye on the numbers.</p>
<p>And tell the truth.</p>
<p>I was struck by how simple some of his ideas were, but also impressed by the fact that over a long period of time he had stuck to these core ideas, bringing him and the organization a great deal of success. I also watched up close as unpredictable events and unforeseen issues threatened to take him off course. But he never ventured from his original plan.</p>
<p>Too often it seems there is pressure on leaders to do things quickly, to have all the answers, and to solve all the problems. Leaders such as my friend know better than to make any mistake in a hurry, and know there will be deep, unpredictable holes that they will step into that threaten to blow them off course.</p>
<p>I was thinking about all this as I read a number of stories about U.S. President Barack Obama's first 100 days in office. Obama told reporters he felt he had to deal with more problems than perhaps any other president in his first 100 days. There is the global economic crisis, fighting two difficult wars, battling to save the North American car industry and even firing the CEO of GM. Swine flu, health care, torture -- it seems like each and every day he deals with a new, substantive challenge.</p>
<p>"And all of this means you can expect an unrelenting, unyielding effort from this administration to strengthen our prosperity and our security ... in the second hundred days and the third hundred days and all the days after," Obama told a national TV audience this week.</p>
<p>For the first 100 days, Obama has stayed on course, using his voice to say the same thing over and over and over again with a confidence that is shocking for a guy who Hillary Clinton once said "has never really done anything."</p>
<p>I recently read a couple of books on Obama, and it is clear his deep-rooted confidence, sense of fairness and ability to communicate is key to his leadership. And he is right. Time will tell if he is successful, not in the first 100 days, but in all the days that follow -- because to truly measure success you have to take the long-term view.</p>

<p>Coldplay giving away free CDs to fans</p>
<p>LONDON Coldplay members say they will reward recession-weary fans by giving away a free CD at all their shows this year.</p>
<p>The band says it will give away the disc, LeftRightLeftRightLeft, starting with the first date of Coldplay's North American tour in West Palm Beach, Fla., May 15.</p>
<p>The nine-track disc will also be available as a free download from the band's website starting the same day.</p>
<p>It was recorded over the past year in various cities and includes the tracks Clocks and Viva La Vida. The band said in a statement yesterday that the giveaway was meant as a "recession-busting mark of gratitude" to Coldplay fans.</p>
<p>Star will shine for Vulcan residents</p>
<p>CALGARY Canadian actor Bruce Greenwood has been announced as the special guest star at an advance screening of the new Star Trek movie in Calgary.</p>
<p>Greenwood, who has appeared in the films Capote and Thirteen Days, plays Capt. Christopher Pike in the film directed by J.J. Abrams.</p>
<p>The screening will be held Wednesday for about 300 residents of Vulcan, Alta., who won a lottery for the chance of the sneak peak two days before the May 8 worldwide release.</p>
<p>The town has built a popular tourism industry based on the fact it shares a name with the home planet of popular Star Trek character Mr. Spock.</p>
<p>It had made a pitch to host the latest movie's Canadian première, but was turned down.</p>
<p>Actor Leonard Nimoy, who played Spock in the original TV series and several movies, went to bat for the town, which prompted Paramount to agree to the private screening.</p>
<p>Radio host suspended for slamming Mexicans</p>
<p>BOSTON A Boston talk radio host has been suspended for calling Mexican immigrants "criminaliens" and emergency rooms "condos for Mexicans" during a discussion about swine flu.</p>
<p>Boston's WTKK-FM host Jay Severin was suspended indefinitely Thursday.</p>
<p>According to an audio clip of a Monday show, Severin complained that the U.S. wasn't doing enough to prevent the spread of swine flu. He then said "tonight we will let the usual 5,000 criminaliens that come across the Arizona border..." referring to Mexican immigrants.</p>
<p>During a conversation with a caller complaining about immigrants receiving health care, Severin said emergency rooms had "become essentially condos for Mexicans."</p>

<p>Pete Seeger marks 90th with Bruce and friends</p>
<p>Nekesa Mumbi Moody</p>
<p>The Associated Press</p>
<p>NEW YORK When Emmylou Harris was a young girl trying to figure out whether she could have a career in music, she decided to seek advice from the wisest man she could think of -- so she wrote a note to Pete Seeger.</p>
<p>She didn't know him and he didn't know her: Seeger was already approaching legendary status, while she hadn't recorded a single tune. Yet, Harris was inspired by his integrity and she'd learned to play the guitar by listening to his classic Where Have All the Flowers Gone.</p>
<p>"I actually wrote him a letter, hand-printed, front and back, I don't know how many pages, saying I want to sing folk music, but I don't think I've suffered enough," she said, laughing. "He actually wrote me back . . . basically saying life will catch up to me, and encouraged me to be bound for glory. Just hearing from him was one of the most amazing things that had ever happened to me, up to that point."</p>
<p>On Sunday, Harris will perform at Madison Square Garden in a tribute concert to Seeger on his 90th birthday. The event will also feature Bruce Springsteen, Dave Matthews, Eddie Vedder, John Mellencamp, Arlo Guthrie, Joan Baez and dozens of others.</p>
<p>The concert will surely be an homage to one of music's most revered voices, a man known for his poignant protest songs and social activism, from the fight for racial equality to labour rights and world peace.</p>
<p>He has been an antiwar activist and is credited for popularizing the civil rights anthem We Shall Overcome. His leftist politics got him blacklisted during the 1950s.</p>
<p>While his politics sometimes overshadowed his music, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member is considered one of folk music's greatest artists and inspired other artists ranging from Bob Dylan to Bruce Springsteen, who in 2006 released the album We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, which features the Boss singing Seeger's songs.</p>
<p>But Seeger is not interested in celebrating past achievements at tomorrow's event. He says he only agreed to take part in the event because it will benefit the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, a nonprofit organization he founded more than four decades ago to help preserve the river, which has suffered from pollution.</p>
<p>Funds from the concert will help restore the Clearwater, the huge boat Seeger built to draw people's attention to the organization.</p>
<p>"We need to raise an endowment fund" for the boat, said Seeger, who lives along the Hudson River in Beacon, in upstate New York. "I agreed to the concert, although I don't like big things."</p>
<p>Harris said putting the focus of the concert on the Clearwater is another example of Seeger's principles being paramount to his music.</p>
<p>"It's never been about Pete," said Harris, who will perform two of his songs. "It's always been about the world and what he believes in and doing the right thing and making the world a better place. He's really lived what he believes; I think it's an inspiring example for all generations."</p>
<p>Seeger will perform one song -- but he's not saying which one. "No one knows except me. It's a secret," he said. His many iconic songs include If I Had a Hammer and Turn! Turn! Turn!</p>
<p>What's wrong with yellow tights?</p>
<p>Hugh Jackman is thrilled he didn't have to wear tights to play Wolverine.</p>
<p>The Australian actor -- who reprises his role as the mutant antihero in new movie X-Men Origins: Wolverine -- is relieved he didn't have to don spandex like many other actors who have brought to life comic book characters on the big screen.</p>
<p>He said: "One of the blessings is that I don't have to wear spandex. I think it's safe to say that me and yellow tights don't get on!" In the original Marvel comic book series, Wolverine -- who has powers of physical regeneration and an adamantium metal skeleton -- wore a bright yellow body suit.</p>
<p>Jackman was required to build a muscular physique for the movie and recently admitted he pushed himself to the limit when he was training by pretending he was Wolverine.</p>
<p>He said: "I work out imagining I'm Wolverine. Wolverine to me is the guy that when everybody else quits, that's where he begins. I think that's why people love him." The 40-year-old actor -- who was named Sexiest Man Alive by People magazine last year -- also revealed it took him a year to get in shape for the action-packed film and he had to completely overhaul his diet.</p>
<p>Vegas comedian Gans dies in his sleep</p>
<p>The Associated Press</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS Danny Gans, one of the most popular entertainers on the Las Vegas Strip for the past decade, died in his sleep yesterday. He was 52.</p>
<p>Gans was found dead about 3 a.m. by his wife, Julie, at their home in Henderson, said <span class="companylink">Wynn Resorts</span> spokeswoman Jennifer Dunne.</p>
<p>Police didn't immediately return calls seeking comment, and the Clark County coroner's office said no information about Gans was immediately available.</p>
<p>"All of us in <span class="companylink">The Mirage</span> family are deeply saddened to learn of Danny's passing," said Scott Sibella, president of <span class="companylink">The Mirage</span>, in a statement released through parent company <span class="companylink">MGM Mirage Inc</span>.</p>
<p>Gans, who performed at <span class="companylink">The Mirage</span> for more than eight years, moved to the Encore Theatre in February. Gans did rapid-fire imitations of personalities ranging from Tony Bennett to Al Pacino to Sarah Vaughan.</p>
<p>His manager, Chip Lightman, released a statement saying: "Danny has been my partner and dear friend for over 18 years. I will truly miss him," Lightman said.</p>

</div><div>Helen Branswell   </div>
<div>Hamilton Spectator wire services</div>
<div>541 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.   </div>
</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>People aged 60 and older may have some immune protection against the new swine flu, a leading influenza scientist said yesterday.</p>
<p>The head of the influenza division at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, also revealed that genetic study of the virus doesn't show the mutations thought to have made the virus that triggered the s0-called Spanish flu of 1918 so deadly.</p>
<p>The 1918 flu virus was also an influenza A H1N1 virus, but is one that is believed to have jumped from birds to humans. The virus that is currently grabbing the world's attention is a swine H1N1.</p>
<p>Dr. Nancy Cox said work being done in the Atlanta labs shows older people have some antibodies that react against the swine H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"What we see is that there is more cross-reactive antibody in people over 60," Cox said in an interview from Atlanta.</p>
<p>"I think we start seeing some increased cross-reactivity at 50, but there's more in people over 60."</p>
<p>In general, Cox said, it's thought that older adults have more cross-reactive antibodies to influenza due to having multiple exposures to multiple influenza strains over their lives.</p>
<p>If the antibodies protect against infection in this age group, that would be a welcome thing, Cox suggested. Seniors are at higher risk than most other age groups of suffering severe illness when they are infected with influenza.</p>
<p>Cox said the centre's labs are also uncovering other things about this new H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The two dozen or so sample viruses the CDC has been able to study are "remarkably similar" to one another genetically, even though they come from far-flung locations -- including Mexico, Germany, the United States and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The never-before-seen combination of swine, bird and human genes seem to fit together like a glove.</p>
<p>"What we can say very definitely is that this genetic combination works well together," Cox said.</p>
<p>"These eight gene segments work well together to infect (and) replicate in humans. And they are transmitted in a sustained fashion from person to person."</p>
<p>Cox said scientists are studying the virus looking for mutations known to cause virulence. While they haven't spotted those thought to be responsible for the Spanish flu's incredible severity -- it is believed to have killed upwards of 50 million people -- they recognize they don't know all possible mutations that could increase the severity of illness caused by flu viruses.</p>
<p>In trying to determine what kind of a threat these swine viruses pose to people, CDC scientists have also been studying blood samples from donors of different age groups, looking for what are called cross-reactive antibodies.</p>
<p>Those are antibodies that are created in response to exposure to one type of influenza virus, but which have some ability to recognize another or others as well.</p>
<p>The protection they offer would generally be expected to be weaker than antibodies generated to fight a precise strain of influenza. But depending on how many and how strong they are, cross-reactive antibodies might prevent infection with a different strain.</p>

<p>MONTREAL</p>
<p>The swine flu pandemic has unleashed a flood of flu-tagged spam e-mail and other potential threats to personal computers.</p>
<p>Major news events typically cause an increase in spam, antivirus software companies said yesterday.</p>
<p>"As soon as the general public is no longer concerned, then spammers will stop using that campaign," said Stephan Chenette, manager of security research at security software company <span class="companylink">Websense Inc</span>.</p>
<p>It's estimated that tens of thousands of spam e-mails have been sent daily since the outbreak started.</p>
<p>Such e-mails play on the public's fears and concerns, Chenette said. "Whenever there's a scary event, they use scare tactics and they're twice as likely to succeed in getting users to open up the e-mail."</p>
<p>Web spam also made the rounds in 2003 during the SARS outbreak. Chenette said spammers have been sending e-mails with attachments that offer information about the virus or are peddling medication -- selling generic facts or fake pills. He said they can also obtain credit card data that can be used in identity fraud, or implant programs that can surreptitiously control a user's computer to gather even more personal data and spread spam to other computers. McAfee Avert Labs cites Brazil as the No. 1 source for swine flu spam.</p>

<p>The latest developments in the H1N1 flu outbreak:</p>
<p>Confirmed death toll: 15 in Mexico and one in the United States (Mexico is now only releasing its number of confirmed deaths and cases; confirmed and suspected numbers totalled 168 deaths and 2,498 cases before the combined tally was halted).</p>
<p>Confirmed cases in Canada: 51 (14 in Nova Scotia, 12 in Ontario, 15 in British Columbia, eight in Alberta, one in Quebec and one in New Brunswick).</p>
<p>Confirmed cases in Mexico: 343.</p>
<p>Confirmed cases elsewhere: 155 in the U.S.; 13 each in Spain and Britain; four each in Germany and New Zealand; two in Israel and France; one each in Switzerland, Austria, China, Denmark and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>WHO alert level: Phase 5 -- Human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region, a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, communication and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short.</p>
<p>Latest developments:</p>
<p>* Prime Minister Stephen Harper said yesterday he doesn't sense panic among Canadians, but realizes they are concerned.</p>
<p>* The federal government expanded its swine-flu prevention campaign to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Twitter and YouTube, with a new "citizen-readiness campaign."</p>
<p>* Mexican tourist visiting Hong Kong becomes Asia's first confirmed case. About 300 people were quarantined at a hotel where the tourists stayed.</p>
<p>Symptoms: Fever, lethargy, lack of appetite and coughing; some report runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>Transmission: Believed to occur through coughing or sneezing, or touching contaminated surfaces before touching mouth or nose.</p>
<p>Misconceptions: The CDC says people cannot get the flu by eating pork or pork products. Air travel is also considered safe, provided it's not to Mexico, for healthy people. Authorities also say there's no reason to keep healthy children home if there's no flu at school, although that could change in the event of a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Advice: Health officials urge those with flu-like symptoms to avoid work or school, wash hands, cough into sleeves and get medical attention.</p>

<p>Hamilton's Dr. Mark Loeb is leading Canada's research efforts against swine flu.</p>
<p>The national task force he chairs is racing to learn as much as possible about H1N1 influenza A, which is threatening to become a global pandemic with cases climbing to 51 in Canada including 12 in Ontario.</p>
<p>Swine flu hasn't officially hit Hamilton yet, but public health staff are investigating three possible cases.</p>
<p>Worried residents are jamming the city's emergency departments.</p>
<p>"If your illness is mild, you should try to cope at home," said Dr. Chris Mackie, associate medical officer of health. "If you need to see a doctor, see a family doctor or a walk-in clinic."</p>
<p>So many have called the city's flu hotline, 905-546-2424, ext. 7970, that its hours have been extended to 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends.</p>
<p>So far, the swine flu has been mild in Canada, but Loeb warns it could get stronger before Canada's next flu season starts in November.</p>
<p>"It could be that things quiet down now and we would be hit with a worse outbreak in the fall," said Loeb, an infectious disease specialist at <span class="companylink">Hamilton Health Sciences</span> who is also chair of Canada's pandemic preparedness strategic research initiative.</p>
<p>Research is key to preventing, or at the very least lessening, the impact of an H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>That is where Loeb and his Canadian Institutes of Health Research task force come in.</p>
<p>By pulling together research already under way in Canada, they're trying to answer questions such as what masks health care workers should wear and does this season's flu shot provide any protection against H1N1?</p>
<p>They're looking at all current Canadian studies on flu pandemic and rushing as many results as possible. Studies are being modified to focus on H1N1 and deliver quick results.</p>
<p>"We're assessing all the research being done and trying to ensure there are no gaps," said Loeb.</p>
<p>Where there are gaps, research is being expanded or new studies started with the help of $21.5 million in five-year federal funding given to the pandemic preparedness research initiative in 2006.</p>
<p>"Additional funding is needed for some of these studies," said Loeb. "We're doing our best with what we already have."</p>

</div><div>By Aldo Santin   </div>

</p>
<p>Employers who send their staff home after they've returned from a trip to Mexico are overreacting to the flu situation, the province's top public health official said Friday.</p>
<p>"We've made this very clear," Dr. Joel Kettner said during Friday's daily news briefing on the flu situation. "It doesn't matter if you returned last week, two days ago or today -- if you feel well, you should go to school or work."</p>
<p>Kettner was responding to reports of employers in Winnipeg, including the River East-Transcona School Division, that have instructed their employees who have returned from Mexico to stay away for one or two weeks until they're certain they're not showing any flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Students from the River East -Transcona division came home Thursday with a note telling parents students and staff returning from Mexico should stay away for one week.</p>
<p>A woman said her employer gave her a one-week paid leave after co-workers complained when they learned she had just returned from a Mexican vacation.</p>
<p>Kettner said such measures aren't necessary.</p>
<p>While the number of confirmed and suspected cases of H1N1 flu virus, also known as swine flu, is increasing across Canada, there are no confirmed cases yet in Manitoba. There have been 18 Manitoba flu samples suspected to be the HIN1 virus, but all the tests were negative, Kettner said.</p>
<p>However, the province is testing 30 to 40 flu samples daily and Kettner said he expects it's just a matter of time before one tests positive for the swine flu.</p>
<p>"We fully expect to find a case of H1N1 in Manitoba," Kettner said.</p>
<p>Provincial officials say Manitoba has never been as ready to deal with a pandemic outbreak as it is now, noting the 2003 SARS experience and the anthrax scares in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States helped health planners get ready.</p>
<p>"This time around, we are better organized," Kettner said.</p>
<p>Dr. Brian Postl, head of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, said two emergency clinics dealing specifically with the swine flu will be operating in the event they're needed -- at <span class="companylink">Seven Oaks General Hospital</span> and Health Sciences Centre. In addition, CancerCare Manitoba is also prepared to set up a special clinic if needed for cancer patients.</p>
<p>"We will only activate the clinic if needed," said Dr. Dhali Dhaliwal, CancerCare Manitoba president.</p>
<p>Dhaliwal said if there is a pandemic, the clinic would be needed because many of the side-effects of chemotherapy are the same as flu symptoms, while patients receiving steroids for treatment wouldn't even realize they are fighting a flu. The City of Winnipeg is also preparing for a swine-flu outbreak, prioritizing essential city services in the event not enough staff can report to work.</p>
<p>Kettner said anyone who has flu-like symptoms -- cough, fever, fatigue -- for more than two or three days should not hesitate to see a physician or go to a hospital or clinic.</p>
<p>Medical staff will take appropriate precautions for anyone suspected of having the flu or swine flu, Kettner said, adding patients will be asked to wear surgical masks and will be kept in an area where they are unlikely to cough on other patients.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Wayne Lees, chief provincial veterinary officer, said the pork industry remains upset with the trade embargo several countries have placed on Canadian pork products.</p>
<p>He said it's not possible to catch the swine flu from an infected pig, adding, however, that all slaughtered pigs in Manitoba are being tested for the swine flu.</p>
<p>A Shilo woman has been prescribed the flu remedy Tamiflu while awaiting tests to determine if she is the province's first case of swine flu.</p>
<p>Mandi Hein said on Friday she won't know until tests come back Monday whether she actually has swine flu.</p>
<p>She came down with flu-like symptoms earlier this week after meeting several times with a friend who had returned from Mexico. Two of Hein's children also have flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"We're all in a self-imposed isolation because doctors asked us to," she said. The National Microbiology Laboratory on Arlington Street has been assisting medical officials in Mexico by testing samples of suspected swine flu. Another 200 samples from Mexico were to be flown to Winnipeg today.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flood water no skeeter haven - But your residential standing pools are, city warns residents</b>
</div><div>By Kevin Rollason   </div>
<div>691 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Winnipeggers are being urged to dump all standing water on their property to reduce mosquito habitat, but the largest area of standing water -- the Red River flood plain south of the city -- is not expected to affect this year's mosquito count.</p>
<p>At least not yet.</p>
<p>With water still surrounding many homes south of the city, Winnipeggers could be forgiven for thinking that mosquitoes could be our fourth Horseman of the Apocalypse -- in the wake of the second-biggest flood in 150 years, the global financial meltdown and the outbreak of the virus formerly known as swine flu.</p>
<p>However, Winnipeg entomologist Taz Stuart said they'd be mistaken.</p>
<p>He said most of the flood water south of the city has either been caused by overland flooding or water spilling out of the banks of the Red River.</p>
<p>So there would be few mosquito larvae thriving in that water because it's so cold, the water is moving and there's no food source for them.</p>
<p>"When it starts to recede is when we may be concerned, but that's probably not until summer," Stuart said.</p>
<p>"As the water recedes, and the temperatures go up, there's some potential for nuisance mosquitoes, but it depends on rains and moisture levels... A lot of sites in the city are drying up."</p>
<p>Stuart encouraged Winnipeggers to get rid of any standing water on their properties by dumping water out of outdoor containers, draining eavestroughs and covering rainwater collection containers with mesh.</p>
<p>With helicopters full of spraying equipment landing behind him during a news conference on Friday, Stuart said the city's larviciding program is well underway.</p>
<p>Four privately contracted helicopters are again spreading larvicide and checking more than 33,000 hectares of water in the city and within 10 kilometres of the city limits. The city's database has information on about 7,000 areas of standing water.</p>
<p>Chuckling, Stuart announced the city's first mosquito count, which, not surprisingly, was zero due to a temperature of -2 C on Thursday night.</p>
<p>While the city had originally targeted 2007 as the first year it would move to using mostly biological measures to control mosquitoes, so far chemicals make up 65 per cent of the program. The city, which now targets biologicals being fully used about four years from now, used only two per cent of biological products in 2001.</p>
<p>"Chemicals are cheaper," he said.</p>
<p>"On average it (biological) is four to five times more expensive."</p>
<p>Stuart said with biologicals he estimated the city's overall insect control budget, which includes cankerworm control, would rise to $12 to $15 million, from the current $5 million.</p>
<p>"We are working within our budget," he said.</p>
<p>But Stuart said even if biological treatment was increased dramatically, there would still always be the potential for chemical fogging.</p>
<p>"We live in a clay pit where you get just a bit of rain and it stays on the ground. When it stays there you can get mosquitoes from eggs to adults in a few days."</p>
<p>Kelly Goldstrand, the city's manager of community resource and protection services, said "fogging continues to be one of the tools in the toolbox. It will always remain a possibility.</p>
<p>"It always depends on what hand nature deals us."</p>
<p>Stuart also said if people want to have insect control buffer zones around their properties they should contact the city now. He said currently about 100 people have buffer zones, but traditionally during the summer months that jumps to 1,300 to 1,600.</p>
<p>For a buffer zone, contact the insect control branch in writing at 3 Grey St., R2L 1V2, or fax it to 311, or register online at www.winnipeg.ca/bugline[http://www.winnipeg.ca/bugline]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stuart said he's probably a few weeks away from knowing how bad this year's cankerworm season will be.</p>
<p>Stuart said it's too late to put up new bands on trees and encouraged people to remove the bands from their trees after the coming May long weekend.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu defence is only as good as the people who take part -</b>
</div><div>Laura Rance / Rural Revival   </div>
<div>825 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>B11</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Global public health and veterinary officials learned very quickly last week that they must choose their words carefully when dealing with a potential pandemic.</p>
<p>There is a razor-thin line between giving people enough motivation to protect themselves and creating panic or irrational reactions.</p>
<p>The misplaced decision to refer to the Influenza A H1N1 originating in Mexico as a "swine flu" proved to disastrous for the world's pork producers. This flu, although similar to influenzas that affect swine herds, is not known to have originated in swine. It has so far only affected humans, even though it carries genetic material from human, swine and avian flu viruses.</p>
<p>Market prices dropped, a long list of countries stopped importing pork and Egypt ordered a mass cull of pigs before officials moved to change the name to the more scientifically accurate Influenza A H1N1.</p>
<p>Influenza fear is blamed for a five to 10 per cent drop in Canada's pork exports since the outbreak began -- another hit for an industry already struggling through what's been called a "perfect storm" of low prices, high feed costs and reduced exports of live pigs to the United States.</p>
<p>Producers were rightly indignant. But at the same time as they were working hard to clear the mythical swine connection, industry officials were keenly aware that this influenza outbreak poses a very real threat on another front.</p>
<p>While pigs haven't been making people sick in this case, there is a danger that humans could infect the pigs -- a development that could shut down this province's industry.</p>
<p>So in addition to informing and calming the public as the Mexican outbreak spread rapidly to countries around the world, health officials were getting the word out to hog producers in Manitoba last week to ensure this influenza doesn't get in the barn door.</p>
<p>It has long been known that humans and swine can exchange flu viruses. Pigs can also act as a host for avian flu viruses, which makes them a potential mixing pot for viruses that are constantly evolving. Researchers studying this potential three years ago identified a different strain of the influenza virus, Influenza A H3N2, that had surfaced in both pigs and humans.</p>
<p>They also noted that the typical swine flues of North America, which were the H1N1 variants, were starting to be much more active after 60 years of relative stability.</p>
<p>Yet one of the lead researchers of that study, Dr. Chris Olsen, veterinary researcher with the University of Madison-Wisconsin, balked at use of the word "volatile," saying it was too inflammatory.</p>
<p>Studies have also shown that barn workers and veterinarians are at greater risk of carrying or contracting the same viruses as the pigs in their barns. The same risk factor has not been linked to meat plant workers.</p>
<p>When provincial officials studied the risk of avian flu's reaching Manitoba through migratory birds and infecting backyard hobby flocks three years ago, they concluded there was a much higher risk of an outbreak originating in the swine herd.</p>
<p>Biosecurity is already strictly enforced on most operations. Barn workers are required to remove their clothes and shower before entering the barn. The clothes they wear in the barn, right down to their underwear, stay in the barn.</p>
<p>The hogs inside are not only genetically similar, the sterile environment in which they live makes them highly susceptible to any new germs to which they come into contact.</p>
<p>And although the shower-in, shower-out rule helps reduce the risk of germs being carried into the barn on a worker's body or clothing, it does not address the germs that might be carried in someone's nasal passages.</p>
<p>One sneeze could prove disastrous. So workers who are feeling ill, especially if they have flu-like symptoms, are expected to stay home.</p>
<p>Additional recommendations that went out to the industry last week advise any workers or barn owners who have travelled to Mexico stay out of the barn for four days after their return.</p>
<p>Outsiders should never enter.</p>
<p>Andrew Dickson, general manager of the Manitoba Pork Council, said the public must respect these protocols just as producers need to enforce them.</p>
<p>There are documented cases in other countries where visiting media crews and in one case a minister of agriculture are believed to have infected the barns they visited. He noted at least one producer in Manitoba last week courted disaster by allowing a television crew into his operation after it had been filming at a hospital where potential flu victims were being tested.</p>
<p>Any defence system is only as good as the people who use it. Even the best protocols can break down -- especially during unusual times.</p>

<p>There is nothing remotely funny about H1N1 influenza, the flu formerly known as swine.</p>
<p>There have been many deaths, the hog industry has been unfairly maligned (and a whole bunch of innocent pigs slaughtered in Egypt), schools are closing in Mexico and the U.S. and the travel industry is taking another devastating hit.</p>
<p>Got that. Understood. Noted.</p>
<p>But what is somewhat amusing (in a scary kind of way) is the glee with which panic and misinformation are being spread.</p>
<p>The fear-mongering is making its way around the world faster than the flu itself.</p>
<p>Here at home, CBC anchor Peter Mansbridge is the self-appointed Canadian Chicken Little, doing everything but shout "Booga! Booga!" as he whips up the audience at home.On a recent newscast, Mansbridge interviewed a doctor who should have been promptly disbarred or defrocked or whatever it is you do to doctors who go on national television with the sole purpose of scaring the pants off people.</p>
<p>I don't have the transcript, but the interview went something like this:</p>
<p>PM: "So, doctor, should people be scared silly?"</p>
<p>DOC: "Yes, very scared, scared to leave their homes, scared to talk to their neighbours, scared to eat a BLT."</p>
<p>PM: "So what you're saying is that we should bar our doors, stop going to Taco Time and hope there aren't any more cuts to the CBC?"</p>
<p>DOC: "Basically."</p>
<p>This week, American Vice-President Joe Biden decided to ring in with some stellar advice:</p>
<p>"I would tell members of my family -- and I have -- I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now," he said. "It's not that it's going to Mexico. It's you're in a confined aircraft. When one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft."</p>
<p>Biden added they should avoid the subway too.</p>
<p>Now, ignoring the fact that, with his reasoning, Americans would have to avoid going to America, the politician did little more than tell the citizenry to stay home and hide in the basement until it's all over.</p>
<p>Survivalists unite! And if you can't avoid riding the subway, please check carefully to make sure there aren't any mariachi bands on it. The next bit of massively popular misinformation came from the so-called stars of a reality television show.</p>
<p>Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt are a pretty pair made infamous on a show called The Hills. They were recently in Mexico getting married or posing for the paparazzi or some combination of the two.</p>
<p>One photo-op showed the couple strolling down the beach wearing masks that appeared to be made of paper napkins. Heidi's skimpy bikini top had more material.</p>
<p>The problem? They were wearing the masks that don't filter out the feared air particles. They were also wearing their masks improperly.</p>
<p>Hint to tourists: If you're still able to sip your Cerveza through the mask, you've got it wrong.</p>
<p>Hint to the rest of us: Do not seek medical advice from people who became famous by exposing their personal lives and body parts on television.</p>
<p>Should we be worried about H1N1 becoming a pandemic? I sure am -- but I'm leaving the information dissemination to the experts and following their advice.</p>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly and often. Cough or sneeze into a hanky or your sleeve. Don't go to work if you're sick. Avoid unnecessary travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>Stop watching Peter Mansbridge until the danger has passed.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a pork chop to fry.</p>

<p>Walker on review</p>
<p>I find myself in the strange position of defending Morley Walker against Graham Ashmore's letter (Correcting Walker, April 29). At the top of Morley Walker's review of Paradise Lost he admitted to being semiliterate. It is therefore not reasonable to expect him to know the difference between free and blank verse, or to get his attribution straight.</p>
<p>While his review irked me, on reflection I have come to realize that the fault was mine. I have come to respect the thick-skinned determination that must be necessary for a confessed semiliterate to carve out a career writing about the arts in Manitoba, especially when you consider the scads of people our colleges and universities graduate every year who are fully qualified to comment intelligently on what passes before their eyes.</p>

<p>Build a hospital</p>
<p>Re: Calling on Ottawa often a futile exercise (April 27). Congratulations to Mia Rabson for recognizing the frustration that First Nation people must endure in dealing with Ottawa and for making it clear that we are not asking for anything more than any other citizen of this country would expect.</p>
<p>Chief David Harper went to Ottawa to get proper health care for his community, Garden Hill First Nation, where in the last few months one child died and another is in critical condition due to medical errors. Why? Because a nursing station built during the Second World War is staffed with only two full-time and two part-time nurses and a doctor flies in about two weeks a month in total.</p>
<p>Chief Harper raised the point that the Island Lake area, where Garden Hill is situated, serves 10,000 people, but the federal government will not build a hospital for the region. While Neepawa, with a population of 3,800 people has a hospital with six full-time doctors.</p>
<p>First Nations live in substandard health conditions and when they travel to Ottawa to protest, the federal minister of health won't even meet to hear their concerns.</p>

<p>Share pension pain</p>
<p>In regards to Larry Kusch's article U of M pension takes 15.7% hit (April 22), Premier Gary Doer states he will work with university and employees to find a solution to any pension shortfall. Is there a law stating that governments must make up shortfalls of public or private pensions? Do we Manitobans want our tax dollars making up shortfalls, while small business owners and individual citizens who do not have access to large pensions have watched our own personal investments erode?</p>
<p>If these pensions are facing funding shortfalls, then the employees and employers should increase their contributions, not come to the taxpayer to do so.</p>

<p>State-ordered therapy</p>
<p>Re: Program in works for drug-addicted prisoners (April 27) by Bruce Owen. The idea that arresting people and then offering them a reward for participating in a "program" is voluntary is ludicrous. Coercion is the method and escaping that coercion is the motivation, there is nothing "voluntary" about it.</p>
<p>The entire war on (some) drugs is most comparable to the Russian war on capitalism. The Russians used to arrest capitalists, "treat" them and pronounce them cured when those who participated saw the light and decided communism was the one true way.</p>
<p>In short, using drugs your government does not approve of is about as much of an "illness" as was reading books the government disapproved of. This is the therapeutic state at its ugliest.</p>

<p>Flu mystery</p>
<p>With the incubation period of the H1N1 virus anywhere from two to five days, and no confirmed origin of the swine flu, why is everyone quick to blame Mexico for this latest outbreak? With the thousands of tourists that may be within Mexico each and every day, some visits from one to three days, the origin could have been brought in to Mexico from a tourist, unless the WHO can provide a definite source. Let's not be quick to judge Mexico!</p>

<p>Gun registry works</p>
<p>I am a long-time firearms owner and hunter and recently retired OPP officer who once managed the Northwest Regional Chief firearms office. Since the Harper government took charge, it is my opinion it is making a mockery of the long-gun registry, an excellent piece of legislation. The end result is that it will deteriorate the enormous amount of information necessary to maintain a legitimate database for use by police.</p>
<p>A recent example in Alberta where four Mounties were murdered by James Roszko showed how the registry helped police identify those who assisted Roszko.</p>
<p>The registry contributes greatly to the strength of the Firearms Act and must be maintained. As firearms owners, we should be paying for our licences and the registration of our firearms during transfers (other than during an inheritance). This would greatly assist the cost of managing the Firearms Act.</p>
<p>Yes, the act and the registry do not solve all the firearms problems, but it is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Pay equity attack</p>
<p>As a member of the Young Feminist Movement of Canada, I am outraged at the Harper government for its blatant attack on women. Bill C-10 radically changes the rules governing pay equity in the federal public sector, eroding women's rights to get equal pay for work of equal value (in the Public Sector Equitable Compensation Act portion). With the help of Liberal MPs, the bill received royal assent March 12.</p>
<p>Bill C-10 has removed the right of public sector workers to file complaints for pay equity with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. It will make pay equity, something that is a human right, into something to be traded away at the bargaining table where employers have historically held the balance of power.</p>
<p>This legislation will force women to file complaints as individuals, imposing a $50,000 fine on any union that encourages a woman to fight for her rights.</p>
<p>This legislation has far reaching implications for all women, and for human rights in general.</p>

<p>Misguided missile</p>
<p>Re: Fire death unnecessary: family (April 29). I am truly sorry for Bradford Bailey's death by smoke inhalation in Norway House.</p>
<p>However, after reading the article I came away with the feeling that the family is blaming "others" for his death: the RCMP in Norway for not going to Bradford's mother's house to "kick him out" for being in the house and drinking with buddies. The family then goes on to blame Bradford's friends.</p>
<p>Bradford chose to go to drinking with his buddies; chose to do so in his mother's house. Yes, it is sad that a fire broke out and he died, but it's time for people to take responsibility for their actions!</p>

<p>Re: Councillor pushes trolley buses (April 28). Coun. Wyatt's request for a feasibility study into running trolley buses on Winnipeg streets is a great idea that is long overdue.</p>
<p>These made-in-Winnipeg buses are environmentally sustainable and would be an excellent way to showcase Manitoba's hydro muscle.</p>
<p>New Flyer's trolley buses did have some issues with the cold in Vancouver but I'm sure this could be resolved relatively easily as for years these types of buses did run on Winnipeg's streets.</p>
<p>This idea is a chance for Winnipeg to show that it can be a city that leads in regards to sustainability. Good thinking, Coun Wyatt.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Travel in turmoil? Let's consider the facts -</b>

</p>
<p>There are periods when the world of travel seems to be tossed into turmoil as worldwide events beyond our control spin into a vortex of media facts and fears.</p>
<p>These past couple of weeks have seen concerns about protests, health and bankruptcy taking over the travel agenda. Hopefully we can create some balance and perspective with today's column. The first question came from the travel-agency community.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Can you please explain that it was not a travel agency but a tour operator that went bankrupt with the closure of <span class="companylink">Conquest Vacations</span> in Toronto a couple of weeks ago?</p>
<p>ANSWER: The travel-agency community was deservedly upset when a headline, as the company was going bankrupt, suggested that Conquest was a travel agency. The story was accurate, but the headline did create a perception that travel agencies could play a part in the demise of this, or any other tour operator. Phil Houde, Manitoba chair for the Association of Canadian Travel Agents (ACTA) wrote a letter to the editor of the Free Press clarifying the misconception, but many travellers still don't recognize the distinction.</p>
<p>"ACTA travel agencies are a big part of the solution, and not any part of the problem, when situations like this occur," Houde says. In past travel-industry bankruptcies, such as Canada 3000 and Jetsgo, it was the travellers who booked through travel agents who got the best results. Their agents worked to help those affected, despite knowing they would never see compensation for their extra efforts.</p>
<p>By and large, tour operators use travel agencies as their primary distribution system for the packaged vacations they offer. With a suffering economy, particularly in Eastern Canada, there was suddenly an overcapacity in the market. Prices were so low that it seemed obvious no one could be making a profit. But there was no sense that travel agencies could predict which, if any, tour operator would go down.</p>
<p>There is not a travel agent in Manitoba, knowing how much extra work that would come back to them later, who would ever book vacation packages for their clients with a supplier they thought might not survive.</p>
<p>Still, when the worst does occur, Manitobans are placed in a dilemma. Ontario has an excellent passenger-protection plan. Manitoba does not. Instead, the province counts on the fact that most travellers will be reimbursed by their credit-card companies on the basis of non-delivery of service. But corporate and school groups, who usually pay by cheque are completely out of luck under this system. And those Conquest clients who ended up having to pay a second time to get out of their hotels in Mexico, will go through significant frustration before their situation is finally resolved.</p>
<p>While the Ontario body, through ACTA, has offered to help Manitoba set up a similar protection program, this offer so far has not been taken up by the government. Perhaps now is the time.</p>
<p>QUESTION: I was considering booking my wedding in Mexico for next winter. What is your advice?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Details of this swine flu health scare are evolving so quickly that by the time you read this it may have already changed dramatically.</p>
<p>A number of people have already started to switch their weddings from Mexico to the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Cuba. I believe it is too soon for such a reaction to the current situation. Once the world health bodies started to issue travel advisories against non-essential travel to that exceptional sun destination, there was an immediate impact on short-term travel to Mexico. And even though we don't know when the advisory will be lifted, tour operators were right to cancel flights until June 1 at least.</p>
<p>In many ways, it already is an international problem and no longer just a Mexican problem, even though that is where the first reported cases of swine flu originated. Many are comparing the current situation to Toronto's SARS epidemic, which, while solved in a reasonably quick time from a health point of view, crippled Toronto's tourism economy for years.</p>
<p>My advice is to wait a few weeks. There is still plenty of time to make a destination decision. This situation could be resolved sooner than we expect. Mexico is by far the top non-stop destination for tour companies who offer travel from Manitoba during the winter season. The reality is that if Mexico is not be in the equation for next season, pricing for all other destinations will go through the roof.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canadians calm in face of flu outbreak; Poll indicates most people think health officials taking right steps</b>
</div><div>Andrew Mayeda, and Sharon Kirkey   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>443 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>As the number of new cases of human swine flu in Canada climbed to 51, Canada's chief public health officer expressed optimism that the outbreak might turn out to be relatively mild.</p>
<p>And a new poll suggests Canadians, for the most part, are staying calm.</p>
<p>The Ipsos Reid poll, conducted exclusively for Canwest News Service and Global National, says fewer than half of those surveyed, 47 per cent, said they are "somewhat" or "very much" concerned that they or someone in their family might contract swine flu over the coming weeks or months.</p>
<p>Eight in 10 -- 81 per cent -- have confidence federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq is taking the right steps to deal with swine flu's spread, and most supported the actions of their local hospitals and health officials.</p>
<p>"I think what this poll says is that no one's panicked out there," said John Wright, senior vice-president at Ipsos Reid Public Affairs. "I don't want to downplay this, but I think the reality is that a lot of Canadians are looking at this in a very pragmatic, sensible fashion."</p>
<p>The poll suggests Canadians have given a vote of confidence to public officials, he said.</p>
<p>"There's nobody who receives poor marks."</p>
<p>Canadian public health officials confirmed 17 new cases yesterday: one in New Brunswick, the province's first; six in Nova Scotia; four in Ontario; two in Alberta and four in B.C. The new cases brought Canada's total to 51.</p>
<p>Like the others before it, the new cases are considered mild and the patients are expected to recover.</p>
<p>Despite the new cases, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said there are several encouraging signs that suggest the outbreak might not be a catastrophic pandemic on the scale of the 1918 Spanish flu.</p>
<p>"We don't know exactly where it's going to go, but what gives me short-term optimism is that we're at the end of what would be normally flu season, so the chances are that this will die down over the summer," said Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>That would buy time to develop a vaccine and do more planning, "so that whatever we face in the fall, whether it's mild or severe, we're in a better position to deal with it."</p>

<p>'I have swine flu," I told her. "You should protect yourself. Quarantine me on the chesterfield with a bag of pork rinds and the channel changer."</p>
<p>"You don't have swine flu," she said. "You have Canucks fever."</p>
<p>"Bobby Loooooo!" I howled, helicoptering a white hand towel above my head.</p>
<p>"Or maybe it's election fever," she said.</p>
<p>"Flying Phil van Dongen!" I howled, power-shifting through an imaginary gearbox.</p>
<p>Or maybe not. Unlike the Stanley Cup playoffs, this election campaign has yet to quicken the public pulse. Plenty of cars flying Canucks flags today; NDP or Liberal banners, not so much. (Try this exercise: Hands up everybody who plans to watch Game 2 tonight. Hands up everybody who plans to watch tomorrow's leaders debate. Note that most of you are still holding the newspaper in one hand.)</p>
<p>Several years ago, British journalist Matthew Engel wrote that while British Columbia was "definitely one of God's better ideas ... its politics are vicious, corrupt, polarized and rather charmingly wacko." Hard to argue against that assessment when every single premier elected since the mid-1970s has been investigated, convicted or forced from office by scandal.</p>
<p>Alas, there's not much charmingly wacko about B.C. politics these days. Or polarized, for that matter. It's like watching vanilla wrestle Wonder Bread. Hence, this campaign has less heat than your first apartment. The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> has a higher interest rate.</p>
<p>It might be more engaging if the battle lines were more clearly drawn, if the parties didn't spend so much time fishing in each other's ponds. Like cats trying to bark and dogs attempting to meow, the Liberals do their best to sound like New Democrats, the New Democrats like Liberals. Carole James vows to throw out the carbon tax, give small business a tax holiday, hire more cops, get tough on crime. Gordon Campbell embraces marginalized aboriginals, pours concrete like Franklin Roosevelt, social-engineers his way into a junk food ban in high schools.</p>
<p>Me, I'd pay more attention if any of them would step up and talk louder about the elephant in the bedroom, the ugly budget numbers likely coming this fall. In February, the government forecast a $495-million deficit for the year, a prediction that even then seemed unreasonably rosy.</p>
<p>An editorial in yesterday's Times Colonist figured the shortfall could climb by as much as $400 million -- a fraction of the $4.7-billion deficit they're expecting next door in Alberta, but still nothing to sneeze at. (To paraphrase the late U.S. senator Everett Dirkson: "A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon you're talking real money.")</p>
<p>James says she'll sail us deeper into red ink if the numbers tank, but the Vancouver Sun's Vaughn Palmer last week quoted Campbell as vowing "the deficit for 2009-10 will be $495 million maximum."</p>
<p>If Campbell won't take us deeper in debt, how will he make up the shortfall? Chop jobs and services? Sell the Kootenays? Hold cruise ships for ransom?</p>
<p>Forget the peripheral stuff like John van Dongen's lead foot and the NDP's <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> Follies; we need the leaders to be up front about the big question -- the consequence of digging, or not digging, a deeper financial hole.</p>
<p>But that's the kind of flaming bag of political dog dung that candidates like to avoid at election time. Much better to punch the hot buttons that launch voters from the couch. A savvy politician would add these planks to the platform:</p>
<p>- Ban pollen.</p>
<p>- Minimum $50 fine for anyone who uses the overworked terms "stimulus package," "economic downturn" or "infrastructure." Capital punishment for "shovel-ready."</p>
<p>- Continue Canada's mission in Afghanistan, but only place those aged 50-plus in combat roles. Introduce mandatory national service for those aged 50-plus.</p>
<p>- Jay Leno devoted a good chunk of Tonight Show air time this week to the story of the naked couple found coupling in a Saanich dumpster. Memo to Tourism Victoria: Time to revive that "Your search for the perfect orgasm is over" marketing campaign. Sign up BFI as a co-sponsor.</p>
<p>- Knighthood for Bobby Loooooo.</p>
<p>If the candidates aren't going to talk about the issues that matter, they should at least entertain us.</p>

<p>Three more cases of swine flu have been confirmed on Vancouver Island -- all considered mild, and all involving adult women. A fourth case was diagnosed earlier.</p>
<p>Across Canada, the number of new cases climbed to 51. Canada's chief public health officer expressed optimism that the outbreak might turn out to be relatively mild.</p>

<p>Several thousand passengers and crew members of the two largest cruise ships to ever visit the city will pour into downtown and local tourist attractions at the same time mid-day Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Carnival Splendor has put Victoria on its agenda, following Royal Caribbean's Mariner of the Seas, which also announced this week that it's rerouting cruises from ports in Mexico. Worries over swine flu are sending large numbers of tourists to other destinations.</p>
<p>"It is an absolute windfall for Victoria," said Chemistry Consulting Group partner Frank Bourree. Government Street merchants will get a direct benefit from these visits, Bourree said.</p>
<p>The ships will each arrive about noon and leave at 10 p.m., giving passengers and crew plenty of time to tour and shop.</p>
<p>Every tourist dollar counts these days since visitor numbers from the U.S. -- a key market for the capital region and the rest of Canada -- have been dropping.</p>
<p>Combined, the two cruise ships are scheduling 21 visits to Victoria. Splendor is stopping eight times, and Mariner of the Seas has boosted its visit number to 13 from six, also at noon Wednesdays. Total cruise-ship visits this year are now at a record 235, said Paul Servos, Greater Victoria Harbour Authority CEO.</p>
<p>These extra stops will increase total ship-visitor numbers to a record of between 460,000 and 470,000, Servos said.</p>
<p>Both ships are being diverted from Mexico and sailing north out of Los Angeles to San Francisco, Seattle and Victoria.</p>
<p>Direct financial impact from the 21 stops will be about $5 million, Servos said.</p>
<p>"We should be prepared because it is going to be busy," he said, estimating that about 7,000 people could disembark.</p>
<p>Ogden Point has handled this many visitors before on Saturday nights, when 9,000 people or more have arrived at once, he said.</p>
<p>Carnival Splendor has 13 decks and carries 3,006 passengers and 1,150 crew. It is 952 feet long, and 113,300 tons.</p>
<p>Coming in slightly larger, the Mariner of the Seas is 1,020 feet, and 138,000 tons. It has 15 decks, carries 3,114 passengers and a crew of 1,185.</p>
<p>Those involved with ship arrivals are busy making arrangements to accommodate the last-minute arrivals.</p>
<p>At the harbour authority, staff are poring over technical drawings of the ships to determine where ramps will go and what type are needed, Servos said.</p>
<p>Other work includes calling in extra longshoremen, notifying tourist attractions and lining up shuttle buses and other transportation.</p>
