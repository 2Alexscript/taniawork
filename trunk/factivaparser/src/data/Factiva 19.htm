<div id="hd"><b>First Nations flu vaccinations half done; Reserves considered high risk</b>
</div><div>Elise Stolte   </div>

</p>
<p>More than half the people living on First Nations reserves in Alberta have received a flu shot, protecting a group labelled high risk after the first wave of the H1N1 pandemic in April.</p>
<p>There were initial transportation problems getting the vaccine to some remote communities, but "they've worked through many of those problems," said Ontario Regional Chief Angus Toulouse, who handles the health portfolio for the national Assembly of First Nations.</p>
<p>"For the most part, First Nations communities are doing well with the rollout."</p>
<p>About 52 per cent of the official on-reserve population has been immunized in Alberta, or about 34,000 people, Health Canada statistics show.</p>
<p>Aboriginals make up less than four per cent of Canada's population, but during the first wave of the pandemic, they accounted for about 12 per cent of the deaths.</p>
<p>The Assembly of First Nations and Health Canada hosted an online summit Tuesday on H1N1 and First Nations. Experts urged all people to get the vaccine as it becomes available.</p>
<p>During this second wave of the virus, "we're not seeing a disproportionate amount of people in First Nations communities with the disease," said Dr. Paul Gully, Health Canada's senior medical adviser.</p>
<p>Poverty is the underlying reason for aboriginals' vulnerability to the virus, Toulouse said. One in five adults don't have access to a doctor in their communities, many people live in cramped and deteriorating housing, and 119 aboriginal communities are still under drinking water advisories, all of which contribute to the spread and severity of the disease.</p>
<p>When the pandemic has passed, First Nations will still be dealing with these issues, National Chief Shawn Atleo told the Tuesday summit. Canada needs to build from here and move on, "so that families no longer live from one crisis to another, one day to the next."</p>
<p>Health clinics on most of Alberta's 44 First Nations have been giving out the shots since Oct. 26, and many have since run out.</p>
<p>Driftpile First Nation, 250 kilometres north of Edmonton on the edge of Lesser Slave Lake, had half of its population of 1,000 vaccinated after three day. They had about 100 doses left. "We had a good turnout," health director Florence Willier said. "I'm just so glad people are taking it in stride."</p>
<p>The clinic in Hobbema, just south of Edmonton, has had about 25 per cent of the 14,000 people living on the four reserves vaccinated, said Randy Littlechild, director for Maskwacis Health Services. They ran out of vaccine and shut down this week, but are expecting another 1,500 doses Thursday.</p>
<p>People were upset when the vaccine ran out at first, he said. "But if there is no vaccine, what can you do about it?" While many people are sick and absentee rates at the local schools have risen in the past two weeks, most cases have been mild. Rates of illness have been roughly equal to neighbouring communities of Ponoka and Wetaskiwin.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Chronic illness groups to get shots; H1N1 flu clinics opening Thursday</b>
</div><div>Hanneke Brooymans   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>774 words</div><div>11 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Vaccination clinics for the H1N1 flu will open up to a large segment of the population with underlying health conditions this week as the death tolls continues to rise.</p>
<p>People with chronic conditions aged 10 to 17 and 55 to 64 can begin using the clinics Thursday. On Friday, the group expands to include those aged 45 to 54 with chronic conditions.</p>
<p>The decision was made after a careful assessment of remaining vaccine supplies and the number of people getting shots, said Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>He added that he did not think there was enough vaccine to include those aged 18 to 44 with underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>Corriveau continued to urge patience. "We would like to avoid having people stand in line for excessive periods of time." Today, Edmonton clinics are open from noon to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Four more people with H1N1 died between Monday afternoon and Tuesday afternoon. Of the two men and two women, three were from the Edmonton area. One was from southern Alberta. All were over 30 and had underlying health conditions. Alberta Health Services would not be anymore specific than that about their ages.</p>
<p>That brings the number of people with H1N1 who have died in Alberta to 29.</p>
<p>During a typical flu season, 11 and 90 people die directly from the flu, and three times that number die from related conditions.</p>
<p>Corriveau said Alberta Health Services will continue to focus on vaccinating high-risk groups for the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>There were an estimated 200,000 to 210,000 vaccine doses left before the two new groups were added Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>An additional 237,000 doses are expected to arrive Thursday. However, almost 127,000 of those doses will be unadjuvanted, intended for pregnant women.</p>
<p>Last year, a record 50,543 infants were born in the province. It's not known why the Public Health Agency of Canada decided to send Alberta a total of 155,500 doses of unadjuvanted vaccine, more than that supplied to British Columbia.</p>
<p>Corriveau acknowledged there would be an excess of the unadjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada could not be reached for comment Tuesday.</p>
<p>Dr. Henry Pabst, a pediatrician at the Misericordia Hospital, said he would advise his patients, including children with underlying health conditions, to get the adjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>"I don't think there's any point" in giving the unadjuvanted vaccine at all, said Pabst, who also tested vaccines and taught immunology and pediatrics at the University of Alberta for nearly 30 years.</p>
<p>"The adjuvant makes a big difference in the immune-system response."</p>
<p>Overall, he said it would be wise if parents with children who are most susceptible would get their children vaccinated.</p>
<p>This advice is particularly relevant for children who have cystic fibrosis or heart conditions, he said.</p>
<p>Clinics opened Tuesday to children under 10 with chronic health conditions, as well as to parents and caregivers of children under six months of age. The other groups that continue to be eligible were children over six months of age on the vaccination date and less than five years of age as of Nov. 1.</p>
<p>Proof of age is required, such as a birth certificate or an Alberta Health Care card. Pregnant women are also eligible.</p>
<p>Once again, turnout was low on Tuesday.</p>
<p>People who were treated at the Commonwealth Stadium and Northgate clinics reported speedy service.</p>
<p>"It's fast," said Lisa Soluri, who went to a clinic with her five-year-old daughter Mila, who has asthma. "I was surprised, actually. We were in and out in 10 minutes."</p>
<p>Soluri wasn't sure why there were no lineups.</p>
<p>"I was thinking people are rejecting it again. I'm kind of confused about why there aren't a lot of people here."</p>
<p>Soluri said her friends with small children also indicated they would be getting their eligible children or themselves vaccinated.</p>
<p>Maureen Rose was pleasantly surprised about how easy it was to get her 15-month-old daughter, Dakodah, vaccinated.</p>
<p>"I just decided it was time to get it done. It's not an easy decision.</p>
<p>"But my sister-in-law is a research nurse so we talked to her and she said, 'Yes, definitely get them done.' "</p>
<p>Rose said she had no problem waiting for her turn.</p>
<p>"I'm healthy. I have no issues that I feel I need to worry about. I feel it's more important to get people with health issues and children done."</p>

<p>If cleanliness is next to godliness, Canadians are in the midst of a religious experience.</p>
<p>Not since the SARS scare has there been such a national obsession with infection prevention, from hand sanitizers in our classrooms to the disinfectants in our homes. Overkill or not, many are hoping the trend will shake up any latent complacency around hygiene, and lead to long-lasting behavioural changes.</p>
<p>"I think patterns have not only changed in response (to H1N1), but that they'll remain changed for quite a while," said John Gaiptman, superintendent of schools for Greater Victoria. "Hygiene has become the norm."</p>
<p>Since April, the school district has invested more than$50,000 in some 800 hand-sanitizer dispensers and hand sanitizers--products that in recent weeks have become as ubiquitous as the apprehension that likely inspired their purchase.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Disney</span> World ordered 200,000 hand sanitizers for its properties; Clorox recently revealed that demand for disinfectants led to a 23-per-cent increase in first-quarter earnings; and Nielsen reports that in the 24 weeks ending Oct. 3, dollar sales of hand sanitizers were up more than 70 per cent, to $118.4 million US, over the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Sherri Rossi, an Oakville, Ont., mother of two, is constantly on the prowl for bathrooms in which to wash up while out, joking that her family's hands are "red and cracked" from diligent cleanliness.</p>
<p>"This has made everybody rethink the way they've been doing things," said Rossi, co-founder of the search-engine optimization company Findability Solutions. "I used to have to fight with my daughter to get her to wash her hands. But now, the kids are being more independent with it. Even my 22-month-old, as soon as we come into the house from doing anything, says, 'Wash the hands.' "</p>
<p>Canadians' heightened alert is especially evident in public places.</p>
<p>The percentage of time that doctors and nurses followed hand-washing protocol at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario has more than doubled, to 83 per cent, since March. And <span class="companylink">Dyson Canada</span>, whose Airblade hand dryers use hospital-grade air filters, is reporting a "significant" increase in inquiries from malls, airports and universities wanting to prevent contamination.</p>
<p>"If you don't fully dry your hands, you might as well not bother washing them," said Dyson microbiologist Danielle Stevens, noting that a wet or damp hand can transfer up to 1,000 times more bacteria to the first person or thing touched than a properly dried hand. "Hand sanitizer makes people happy, but it doesn't solve the problem."</p>
<p>Nurse Marilyn Evans, a community health expert, says sustaining behavioural changes on a national scale won't be easy--especially when people have taken their health for granted for so long.</p>
<p>"If you had put a hand sanitizer out in public before the pandemic, I don't think people would have used it," said Evans, an assistant professor in the faculty of health sciences at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ont. "Eight months from now...people might think, 'There's no threat anymore, so I don't have to worry.' "</p>
<p>That infection prevention has become such a huge part of the public consciousness will help, according to a manners maven at the Emily Post Institute. "Behaviour has a better chance of sticking when people are talking about it," said Anna Post. "Swine flu is a good reminder that we should've been doing these things anyway, scare or no scare."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccine scandal may be brewing in afghanistan; report of detainees getting shots before Canadians investigated</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick and Matthew Fisher   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>646 words</div><div>11 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Tuesday she was "disturbed" to hear that Afghan detainees may have the opportunity to roll up their sleeves for the H1N1 vaccine before thousands of Canadians, and she has ordered an investigation.</p>
<p>The Department of National Defence, meanwhile, says that no Afghan detainees have been vaccinated to date--although a DND spokesman did not quite rule out offering the vaccine to them at a later date.</p>
<p>"Vaccinations against H1N1 are being offered to members of the Canadian forces and Canadian civilian personnel deployed in Afghanistan. The Canadian forces are providing appropriate medical care to those in their custody," said DND spokesman Major Jason Proulx.</p>
<p>"Offering vaccinations to detainees for H1N1 would be based on medical need and at this point there is no program to vaccinate detainees. No vaccine has been provided to any detainee."</p>
<p>Aglukkaq told a news conference in Ottawa Tuesday afternoon that she'd just heard about the detainee vaccination report an hour earlier.</p>
<p>"We've always said all along that ensuring Canadians receive the vaccine is our priority. Personally I'm very disturbed by the news and I can say that we did not make this outrageous decision and I've asked my officials to look into that."</p>
<p>Provinces and territories began immunizing high-priority Canadians on Oct. 26 and clinics were immediately swamped with people who waited hours and hours in line for their shots. The demand was outstripping supply, and some clinics were forced to close. Canada has ordered 50.4 million doses of the vaccine but it's being rolled out in phases, as it comes off the production line at <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>'s factory in Quebec.</p>
<p>By the end of this week about 8.5 million doses will have been delivered, according to federal officials. The general public has been asked to wait to get immunized until people at higher risk, including pregnant women, children under five years old and people under age 65 with chronic conditions, receive their shots.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq has said immunizing the entire Canadian population could take eight to 12 weeks, and the goal is to have the campaign completed by the end of December.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, a Canadian military spokesman suggested a "relatively small number" of detainees would be offered the vaccine.</p>
<p>"They may not take it. They may not trust us," said Maj. Mario Couture, a senior public affairs officer at the Kandahar base. "This is on a voluntary basis."</p>
<p>Couture said Canadian military officials in Afghanistan received legal advice on offering the vaccine to the prisoners and that the advice was forwarded to Canadian government officials in Ottawa.</p>
<p>"Because of the Geneva Convention we have no choice but to treat detainees like our own soldiers. We're not at war in the classical sense between states where there are prisoners of war, this is an insurgency with detainees," said Couture.</p>
<p>"Still, when we have detainees, we have an obligation to them to treat them as prisoners of war and to give them a certain level of care. This includes food and many other things."</p>
<p>According to Couture, the vaccines offered to detainees are from the Canadian Forces stockpile and not from lots designated for other Canadians.</p>
<p>Canadian soldiers began receiving their shots at the Kandahar base last week and to date, about 2,000 out of 2,800 soldiers have been immunized. Meanwhile, immunization clinics on Canadian soil are ongoing and are working their way through Canadians who have been identified as high risk. Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said Tuesday the H1N1 virus appears to be picking up speed. "We can expect to see more illness in the weeks and months ahead."</p>

</p>
<p>Auditor-general Sheila Fraser couldn't have picked a better time to release her report on the federal government's failure to adopt an emergency-response plan.</p>
<p>The chaotic roll-out of the H1N1 vaccine has been front-page news for days. The sight of lineups of pregnant women, babies and the elderly fuelled anxiety and anger among many Canadians in equal measure.</p>
<p>With half of all H1N1 vaccine doses marooned in storage while various levels of government blame each other, did we even need Fraser's report to know that Canada can't handle an emergency? There is no flu epidemic; people are just nervous. And the response is still catastrophically disorganized.</p>
<p>Fraser puts the blame squarely on the shoulders of the federal government. Public Safety Canada's emergency response plan has yet to be endorsed by the government or the federal departments that are supposed to work with it.</p>
<p>The result is that the body whose job it is to co-ordinate federal departments, provinces and territories in the event of a major disaster lacks the authority to carry out its job.</p>
<p>Fraser said she could find no reason why the emergency response plan, in the works since Public Safety was created in 2003, has not been approved six years later.</p>
<p>But even without formal approval, the public-safety department could have done more to help prepare the country for an emergency, Fraser said.</p>
<p>Elementary measures have not been taken: The department has not identified how much food, water and energy supplies or medical services would be needed in an emergency. It has not helped put in place a system that would allow police, firefighters and other first responders to communicate with each other across the country. There are no standards for compatible radios. No plan is in place to protect the electrical grid or cyberspace from attack.</p>
<p>Nor is there any sense of urgency about fixing these problems. Fraser reported that for the past two years the sub-department responsible for emergency management has not spent a third of its budget. With a budget of $58.5 million, there was enough money to get started on resolving the problem of incompatible radios.</p>
<p>If there's one thing the disorganization around the H1N1 flu vaccine has made clear, it's the need for a federal body empowered to lead a co-ordinated, centralized response to national emergencies.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Recent swine flu victims had underlying conditions: official; Eight B.C. residents, ranging in age from eight to 80, died from H1N1 virus in the past week</b>
</div><div>Pamela Fayerman   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>944 words</div><div>11 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Eight B.C. residents ranging in age from eight to 80 died in the past week from H1N1 swine flu, but all had underlying health conditions, provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall said Tuesday in his weekly update.</p>
<p>He would not disclose the child's pre-existing medical problem but said all of those who died had conditions such as developmental disabilities, cancer, or conditions affecting various organs or the immune system.</p>
<p>There were 202 people with severe cases of H1N1 admitted to hospitals across the province in the last week, bringing to 601 the total number of severe infections since April. Twenty-three deaths have been attributed to H1N1, including 22 in patients with underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>But Kendall said he thinks the impact of swine flu is being mitigated by the fact that about 20 per cent of the population has now been vaccinated.</p>
<p>As well, the province has an antiviral medication stockpile large enough to treat one million people and 10 per cent of it has now been dispensed. About 4,400 prescriptions for Tamiflu were filled last weekend alone, compared to 4,800 the weekend before.</p>
<p>Kendall estimates that up to 50 B.C. residents might die from swine flu.</p>
<p>"I know many people are waiting to hear that we've reached the peak of the second wave. I include myself in that. But as of right now, I can't say we are there yet. We haven't seen any marked downward trend...but what we may be beginning to see is the start of a levelling off," he said, noting there were 202 new severe cases of H1N1 last week and 183 the week before.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there were eight deaths in the past week, compared to only three the previous week.</p>
<p>The Fraser Health region has been hardest hit, with 262 severe cases, including 11 deaths, followed by 157 in Vancouver Coastal (five deaths), 130 in Interior Health (three deaths), 27 severe cases on Vancouver Island (four deaths) and 25 severe cases (no deaths) in the Northern Health region.</p>
<p>This week's deaths occurred in three regions -- three in Vancouver Coastal, three on the Island and two in Fraser. Deaths were fairly evenly distributed across age ranges -- one under age 20, one in the 20-to-39-year-old age group, two in the 40-to-50-year-old group, two in the 50-to-60-year-old group and two in the 60 and older group.</p>
<p>Kendall said "while every death is regrettable" the number of deaths from swine flu so far is still lower than what is usually seen in seasonal influenza. The difference is that seasonal influenza, which has not yet taken a firm hold, predominately kills older people while swine flu is hitting a considerably younger demographic.</p>
<p>Hospitals are operating at, near, or over capacity in intensive care units because of the number of patients requiring breathing support. But Kendall said he's encouraged by the fact that ICU admissions haven't been climbing in recent days.</p>
<p>Thirty-eight patients are on ventilators now, compared to 41 late last week and 46 on a day earlier last week. Kendall said hospitals here are not yet cancelling elective surgeries en masse because of the burden of influenza, as they are in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>Swine flu has infected an estimated 20 per cent of the population and doctors' recent billings specific to swine flu reflect that.</p>
<p>Up to Nov. 3, family doctors billed the government for 32,193 office visits related to H1N1 at $31.15 per visit.</p>
<p>On top of that, Health Insurance BC reports that between Oct. 1 and Nov. 3, there were 16,785 physician claims for the special "telephone advice regarding H1N1 virus" billing code at $14.74 for each H1N1 phone consult.</p>
<p>Kendall also commented Tuesday on a new Angus Reid public opinion poll that indicates Canadians are critical of the way governments have dealt with the pandemic.</p>
<p>In the online survey of 1,003 Canadian adults, only 36 per cent said they are satisfied with pandemic preparedness (50 per cent in B.C.) In this province, only eight per cent of poll respondents said they had been immunized as of Nov. 5, which varies from the actual evidence that about 20 per cent of the population has been vaccinated. (The survey polled only adults, which helps to explain the contradiction.)</p>
<p>Kendall said while it would be nice to see a higher satisfaction rate, vaccine production and distribution challenges have likely influenced public perception. B.C. is expected to get 250,000 more doses of vaccine this week, which will be given to patients next week. Kendall said he still has not been vaccinated against H1N1 himself because he is not in a high-risk group.</p>
<p>Even if infections level out in two or three weeks, he still advises people to get vaccinated as late as a month from now because there could be a third wave of H1N1. Apart from that, H1N1 is expected to circulate for years.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A long night of debate leading to a foregone conclusion; Back-to-work bill passes after NDP gets some licks in but inevitably lost the fight</b>

</p>
<p>The clocks at the legislature were nudging toward 2 a.m. Inside the chamber, the debate on the bill to end the paramedics' dispute was in its far-from-sparkling seventh hour.</p>
<p>New Democratic Party MLA Lana Popham had the floor. "You're yawning," she said, noting the demeanour of the scattering of members on the government side. "I know it's tough to listen to us go on and on, but you don't have any choice."</p>
<p>Well, some didn't have any choice. The B.C. Liberals had stocked their benches with a bare minimum of members needed to maintain a presence, albeit a yawning one. The rest were back in their offices, sawing logs.</p>
<p>How many were on call? wondered Opposition house leader Mike Farnworth. Enough to carry the vote in a pinch? Probably. Still, only one way to be sure. And there's no harm in giving his own side a little jolt as well.</p>
<p>He slipped Popham a note saying that when she reached the end of her dissertation on the evils of the back-to-work legislation, she should move adjournment of the debate.</p>
<p>She did so, which woke everyone up. Particularly after the clerks rang the bells to summon members to the chamber for the necessary vote to adjourn.</p>
<p>As representatives from both caucuses staggered in, Farnworth noted the groggy "Whazzup?" the annoyed "I was in the middle of a really good dream," the expectant "Can we go home now?" and one Liberal with such a case of bed-head that he appeared to be wearing a fright wig.</p>
<p>The NDP house leader also caught a knowing wink from one of the veterans on the Liberal side, who recognized the game at hand because he'd played it himself during his days in Opposition.</p>
<p>Call a snap vote on a procedural motion. Government wins handily, as it did, 42 votes to 24. Still, members on both sides are reminded of the stakes and why it is necessary to be at their posts at such an ungodly hour.</p>
<p>Time was when all-nighters were part of the legislature routine. Rarely did the house get through a year without a number of them.</p>
<p>But the fixed sessional calendar, proposed by the New Democrats during their last year in office and implemented by the Liberals during their first year, brought order to the schedule, greatly reducing the incidence of around-the-clock sittings.</p>
<p>The two sides even tried to negotiate a way to avoid one over the paramedics legislation.</p>
<p>The B.C. Liberals wanted the bill to pass before the house adjourned for a scheduled 10-day break, starting at 6 p.m. Thursday. The New Democrats did not see the urgency. The dispute had been festering for much of the year. Why the rush?</p>
<p>Farnworth countered with an offer to expedite passage during the first few days after the house reconvened on Nov. 16.</p>
<p>The Liberals were insistent. The union was voting on an offer that its leadership had already denounced (in an unguarded moment) as "crap." Vanoc had for several months been lobbying the government to end the uncertainty over ambulance services. An escalating number of British Columbians were being rushed to hospital with H1N1. Time to settle the thing.</p>
<p>Government house leader Mike de Jong offered Farnworth an extra day for debate. But that would be it.</p>
<p>The New Democrats were dug in to their position as well. In government, they sometimes legislated unions back to work. In Opposition, they invariably take the side of the strikers and with a party convention looming later in the month, there would be no exception made in this case. No deal, Farnworth advised de Jong.</p>
<p>So began the final dance. As the house came to the end of business on Thursday, de Jong made a motion for an extra sitting on Friday. The New Democrats debated that for an hour, then let it pass.</p>
<p>Friday morning, the house resumed for another four hours of speeches by the New Democrats on the theme "Unions good, Liberals bad." At 1 p.m., proceedings were adjourned for the visit to the provincial capital by Prince Charles and Camilla. Farnworth represented the Opposition in the receiving line.</p>
<p>With the royals out of the way, the two sides reconvened at 7:30 p.m. for the final marathon, which dragged through the night, including several hours after the defeat of the Opposition's upstart motion to adjourn debate.</p>
<p>Not long after sunrise Saturday, the New Democrats stopped talking, the vote was called, and the government passed the bill by a comfortable 16-vote margin. All that remained was for Lt.-Gov. Steven Point to give royal assent.</p>
<p>Mind, he'd spent the previous evening entertaining the royals, his overnight guests at Government House. Maybe he'd sleep in and send Prince Charles instead. Maybe the prince, witnessing the tail end of a B.C. legislature all-nighter, would conclude that these colonials were unready for self-government.</p>
<p>Joking aside, his honour showed up to do his duty and at 8:10 a.m. Bill 21, the Ambulance Services Collective Agreement legislation, was an Act.</p>
<p>The Liberals had got what they wanted, albeit not as quickly as they wanted it. The New Democrats had the consolation, such as it was, of having delayed the legislative express for 36 hours. But that's nearly always how it is in the legislature. The Opposition has its say, then the government has its way.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Adverse reactions to H1N1 vaccine few, far between; Benefit of shot outweighs risk, experts suggest</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>646 words</div><div>11 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Public-health officials in Ottawa have received 19 confirmed reports of allergic reactions to the H1N1 flu shot since the city's vaccination campaign began more than two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Of that number, seven people were transferred to hospital emergency rooms, but to date, none has required hospitalization, said Dr. Nadine Sicard, Ottawa's associate medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Another 11 cases are being investigated by health officals to determine whether they were, indeed, adverse reactions. In addition, one person was hospitalized for a reaction that was "temporarily associated, although not directly related to the vaccine," Sicard said in an e-mail. She did not provide further details.</p>
<p>To date, 140,000 residents, mostly those at high risk of developing complications from swine flu, have received the pandemic vaccine. That suggests 0.01 per cent, or one in 10,000 people who were vaccinated, have so far had a suspected allergic reaction to the shot.</p>
<p>"This is within the expected range for a vaccine," said Sicard. Adverse reactions can range from a sore arm, which is common and does not require medical treatment, to dizziness or fainting. Serious adverse reactions that require immediate medical attention include an anaphylactic response, in which the throat closes, blood pressure plunges and airways tighten.</p>
<p>The maker of the H1N1 vaccine, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, warns that up to one in 1,000 doses may result in an allergic reaction leading to a "dangerous decrease of blood pressure."</p>
<p>Sicard said early data suggests about one in 1,000 Ottawa residents who have received the shot have reported some reaction within 15 minutes of getting it. "These are mostly hives and tingling on the tongue that we would regard as significant and reportable," said Sicard. "Some have been fainting episodes and a handful have been clinical allergic reactions requiring treatment."</p>
<p>In some cases, paramedics have been called. In others, reactions have been monitored at the city-run vaccination clinics, where people who get the H1N1 vaccine are required to remain for at least 15 minutes after the shot, specifically to watch for any possible side effects.</p>
<p>A study published this month in the British journal The Lancet anticipates that deaths, spontaneous abortions or Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a rare neurological condition that can cause paralysis, could be blamed on the swine-flu shot. But according to the study, those events will not necessarily have anything to do with the vaccine.</p>
<p>That poses a public-relations challenge for health officials, who worry that sensational media reports of deaths and illnesses could result in people avoiding the H1N1 shot, said Dr. Paul Hébert, an epidemiologist at The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute.</p>
<p>Every year in Canada, there are an estimated 700,000 heart attacks, 50,000 strokes and 100,000 miscarriages. Inevitably, officials say, some of these will happen within hours or days of a flu shot.</p>
<p>"We're going through a massive vaccination program and inevitably, things are going to happen," said Hébert, who's also the editor-in-chief of the Canadian Medical Association Journal.</p>
<p>"The difficulty is, are these attributable to the vaccine? And the answer is, we have no clue. People die or have heart attacks every day, with or without the flu shot."</p>
<p>With the H1N1 vaccine, health officials are watching for Guillain-Barré and other potential adverse effects. In the meantime, experts continue to urge the public to get the pandemic flu shot because, they say, the chance of being infected with the virus is greater than the chance of developing side effects from the vaccine.</p>
<p>"The adverse reaction is a very rare event. I think having flu is a lot more likely," said Bhagirath Singh, scientific director of the Institute of Infection and Immunity at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</p>

<p>After losing by two votes in Gatineau's civic election, Stefan Psenak ended up beating veteran Aylmer councillor Frank Thérien by one vote in a judicial recount Monday.</p>
<p>Psenak, 39, the owner of a translation and communication company, is one of three members of the civic movement Project Gatineau elected to council. The movement, which does not yet call itself a civic political party, favours planning Gatineau as Quebec's fourth largest city instead of concentrating mostly on district issues.</p>
<p>Other Projet Gatineau members elected include Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin in Buckingham and Mireille Apollon in l'Orée-du-Parc district.</p>
<p>Psenak was sworn in as the councillor for Aylmer on Wednesday along with Mayor Marc Bureau and most other council members.</p>
<p>The final count in Aylmer was 1,789 votes for Psenak to 1,788 votes for Thérien, 68, who has decided not to appeal.</p>
<p>Psenak said there is no contradiction between taking care of his district and working to make Gatineau a big and successful city formed by the amalgamation of Aylmer, Hull, Gatineau, Buckingham and Masson-Angers in 2002.</p>
<p>"A lot of people are worried that most of the housing construction in Gatineau during the last eight to 10 years has been in Aylmer," Psenak said. "I am in favour of clever, sustainable development and I am not against business people."</p>
<p>Psenak said he hopes Project Gatineau members can improve the city. He said the organization held public discussions months before the election and will push for more citizen participation in city planning.</p>
<p>He said some people think Projet Gatineau should be a political party while others regard it as a team. "We have to open our minds to change -- I am not saying I am in favour or against it."</p>
<p>Thérien, who served 10 years on Aylmer council and four years on Gatineau council, said he might have won the election if so many seniors had not been afraid to vote because of the H1N1 flu virus. He said the voter turnout in Aylmer was only 33 per cent.</p>
<p>"I am disappointed in a way but I am sort of relieved because now I can start doing the things I want to do the way I want to do them," said Thérien, who wants to travel more.</p>
<p>"Psenak is more for the big city than the ward system. Nobody is better off with amalgamation than they were before. Municipal services have declined and taxes keep going up."</p>
<p>Thérien said Aylmer had a $40-million debt when it joined the larger municipality while Gatineau has a $500-million debt that grows by about $50 million a year.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Outaouais faces clinic closures; H1N1 vaccine supply can't match demand</b>

</p>
<p>The Outaouais may be almost out of H1N1 flu vaccine by Friday, forcing the closure of West Quebec vaccination clinics or a reduction in the number of hours they will be open.</p>
<p>Dr. Guy Morissette, the director general of the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de l'Outaouais, said about 45,000 people have been vaccinated so far.</p>
<p>The priority groups receiving vaccine include health-care workers, pregnant women, children between six months and five years old, people who live with children who are less than six months old, people who have chronic health problems and those who live with people who have weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>Morissette said the campaign is going well because people have understood the importance of being vaccinated. Outaouais clinics are vaccinating about 5,000 people a day.</p>
<p>People who attend the clinics receive a ticket or bracelet and are told when they should return for the flu shot. Morissette said the rest of Quebec has adopted the coupon system developed in the Outaouais to avoid long lineups.</p>
<p>"People have understood that it is important to be vaccinated, not only for themselves, but also for their families and the people around them," the director of the Outaouais health and social services agency said. "We will be receiving 11,000 doses of vaccine this week but we think the clinics will be running short maybe by this weekend. When we run short of vaccine we will either have to reduce the number of people who are vaccinated or close the vaccination centres for one to three days."</p>
<p>Morissette said health officials won't be able to vaccinate the general public for at least 10 days. The next priority groups could include people over 65 and those between five and 20 years of age.</p>
<p>Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc said on Oct. 30 there will be enough vaccine for everyone on the Quebec side of the Ottawa River.</p>
<p>"Everywhere in Canada we were surprised by the number of people who wanted to be vaccinated," Bolduc said. "Two weeks ago only 30 to 40 per cent of the population wanted to be vaccinated. Now I think we have taken control of the situation and, in the next few weeks, we will have enough vaccine for everyone."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 booster for HIV patients under trial</b>
</div><div>Tom Spears   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>

</p>
<p>An Ottawa study hopes to find the best way to prevent flu in people with compromised immune systems -- and to have the results before the H1N1 wave is finished.</p>
<p>The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute is studying 150 people with HIV. The team leader says the results should apply to anyone whose immune system is damaged.</p>
<p>Results could be ready by January. Normally these studies take years -- first to design, and to have approved by a hospital ethics committee; then for the hands-on work; then analysing the data; and finally getting a medical journal to review it independently.</p>
<p>All get flu shots, but some get one shot (the usual treatment for adults) and others get an extra booster shot three weeks later.</p>
<p>Researchers will measure influenza antibodies "to give you a rough idea of how much immunity and how much protection has been achieved by vaccinating them," said Dr. Curtis Cooper, an infectious disease specialist who leads the group.</p>
<p>"HIV patients, just like any other immune-compromised person, are a little bit more susceptible to being infected with influenza, and are a little bit more susceptible to having a severe illness that could require hospitalization or even death," Cooper said.</p>
<p>That's true for all flu strains.</p>
<p>"We still don't know what the proper way to immunize HIV patients is, to protect them from influenza," he said. "And the information will be valuable for everybody who's immune-suppressed."</p>
<p>This includes people who have had organ transplants, treatment for lupus, or chemotherapy.</p>
<p>People with weakened immune systems often don't respond well to a flu shot. Last year, Cooper began testing whether a booster shot is useful with seasonal flu.</p>
<p>But last year's flu was a milder strain, and he's hoping this year's severe flu will give a clearer answer. He suspects a booster will be useful.</p>
<p>The study is being fast-tracked by The Ottawa Hospital, Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, in order to get answers in January -- during this flu season.</p>
<p>Dr. Timothy Rogers of the Canadian AIDS Treatment Information Exchange said this type of information "is urgently needed."</p>
<p>Volunteers come from Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax, and are in overall good health. They started getting flu shots a week ago.</p>
<p>The vaccine has an adjuvant, or additive designed to improve the immune system's production of antibodies. That's the more common type of H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a team in France has recently announced a similar study.</p>

<p>I don't understand why teachers were not eligible to be vaccinated against the H1N1 flu at the same time as health-care professionals.</p>
<p>Teachers take care of other people's children daily, so that parents can be liberated to go to work. How is it that teachers were not considered to be at the same level of risk as other caregivers?</p>
<p>It seems to me that it would take about an hour in each school on Montreal Island to vaccinate all staff and students. This would have minimized potential risks, not to mention reducing panic and chaos for worried parents.</p>

<p>I didn't think it was a matter of "deserving" the vaccine; I thought it was a matter of needing it. In fact, I'd argue that anyone generous enough to deserve it would graciously step aside to permit those who need it go first.</p>

</p>
<p>Why are teachers being left out of the H1N1 vaccination loop?</p>
<p>I understand why front-line health care workers are given priority since they are constantly exposed to infected people but many of the patients visiting local hospitals have spent the prior weeks attending some type of educational institution sharing a small space with hundreds of other students and teachers.</p>
<p>Every time the bell rings, the hallways fill up with scores of coughing, sneezing students who have been sent to school by parents who can't stay home with them, or senior students who are afraid to miss classes when university application marks are being determined.</p>
<p>The Ottawa Public Health department claims that they are working with the local school boards to ensure infection controls are in place, yet the only changes I've seen in my school is a sign, "How to wash your hands," in a bathroom and a bottle of hand sanitizer in my classroom.</p>
<p>How effective is it to wash a hand that will soon come into contact with eight steel-handled fire doors on a return trip to the office? Those door handles often mimic Petri dishes in texture and germ content. A request to have these doors propped open for the duration of the pandemic was apparently quashed by the fire marshal's office.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree, but when I read about hockey players jumping the queue to get vaccinations, I think that it's every man for himself.</p>
<p>So when the first few teachers get hit with H1N1, schools may witness the mayhem when scores of unvaccinated teachers stay home for weeks. It's time to wipe the slate clean and try approaching the task of prioritizing vaccinations with common sense.</p>

<p>I'm writing about my absolutely amazing experience at the H1N1 clinic offered Saturday for pregnant women at The Ottawa Hospital, Riverside campus.</p>
<p>Never have I met such a thoroughly trained, organized and positive group of individuals. Each and every person I encountered during my visit, from the parking lot attendants (who did not charge any parking fees!), the entrance greeters, to the volunteers helping patients sign in and direct us through the corridors, to the nurse who administered my vaccine and the others who monitored us following the vaccination.</p>
<p>Each step of the procedure was cared for in great detail and each volunteer was as positive and helpful as the one before. I was truly left speechless by the fantastic organization and pleasantness of each individual working there today. If this wasn't enough, there was absolutely no wait time, aside from the customary 15 minutes post-vaccination to monitor for adverse reactions.</p>
<p>After all the horror stories about line-ups and wait times, I felt compelled to share this positive experience and to recognize the hard work and diligence of all the people who were involved in setting up and running this clinic today. Thank you and well done!</p>

<p>I am a mother of three young children whose ages are four, seven and 10. I am informed, educated, and resourceful. I read, search out answers to questions in a thoughtful and well researched manner. But I also have been confused and unsure as to what to make of the mountain of misinformation and fear-mongering that welcomes us each day as we consume our dose of daily of H1N1-related news.</p>
<p>I waited 10 days before bringing my youngest child to be vaccinated, mainly because I refused to make my decision based on fear. While countless others, many of who were not in the priority groups, lined up to get their inoculation, I continued to research hoping to dispel some of the myths, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies that I came across.</p>
<p>What finally convinced me to inoculate my youngest daughter, Elisa? Trust -- not in the system or the spokespeople, or the Internet, or the opinion of strangers. It was the relationship that I have with my pediatrician, Dr. Stephen Grodinsky, that finally convinced me to have my four-year-old daughter inoculated.</p>
<p>Trust that was build up over 10 years of weighing pros and cons, of being there when I needed his advice, of respecting his judgment and him mine, and of building a relationship based on mutual respect. We are partners, my pediatrician and I, in ensuring the safety and well-being of my children.</p>
<p>And so, after all my soul-searching and research, it came down to the strength of my relationship with an individual whose expertise and advice I have sought out countless times before.</p>
<p>The day after her inoculation, I spent time with friends, once again weighing the pros and cons of my decision. They have decided not to inoculate their two children, as has a dear friend who is in her third trimester. Why? Fear. They are afraid of the unknown and the thousands of unanswered questions that fill their heads and hearts.</p>
<p>Each of us has to make a decision based on what matters most to us -- what I have found though is that fear paralyzes people into making decisions that may or may not reflect their values. Some have acted without thinking while others are thinking without acting. My decision was made easier by reaching out to someone I trust.</p>

<p>- Twenty more H1N1-related deaths were reported across Canada on Tuesday, bringing the number of deaths since the outbreak began last spring to 135.</p>
<p>- Alberta said people with chronic conditions between five and 17 years old and between 55 and 64 years old would be able to receive the H1N1 vaccine beginning today. Those with chronic health problems between the ages of 45 and 54 will be able to get the shot starting Friday.</p>
<p>- On Tuesday, Manitoba recorded its first H1N1-related death this fall. Health officials said the death was that of an adult who had underlying medical conditions and was lab-confirmed to have swine flu. Seven people died in the province last spring during the first outbreak of H1N1.</p>
<p>- Eight new deaths were recorded this past week in British Columbia: three in Vancouver, three on Vancouver Island and two in the Fraser region.</p>
<p>- H1N1 clinics in Ontario were expanded Tuesday to include vaccinations for police and firefighters, prison staff and seniors who live in long-term care homes. Ministry of Health employees who deal with the outbreak are also now eligible for vaccinations. Those in other high-priority groups, including pregnant women, were still urged to get their shots. The province says it received 395,000 doses of adjuvanted vaccine and 375,000 unadjuvanted doses this week.</p>
<p>- In Nova Scotia, health officials said that their clinics will be open to people younger than 65 with chronic health problems, those living with or looking after infants and those who live with people who are at high-risk, but can't be immunized. Those in the high-risk priority groups are still eligible for shots if they haven't received them yet. The province says all clinics will be closed today for Remembrance Day.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The federal government has yet to approve the Canadian version of the swine flu vaccine for pregnant women even though more than one million doses will have been shipped across the country by this weekend.</p>
<p>"I will not jump the process. I will not skip a step in ensuring that the vaccine is safe," Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq told a news conference Tuesday after saying she expects to authorize the vaccine this week.</p>
<p>Canada ordered 1.8 million doses of a version of the H1N1 influenza vaccine that does not contain adjuvant - an additive that stretches supply and boosts immunity - from domestic manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline Inc. because there was a lack of data on the effects the adjuvant could have on a pregnancy.</p>
<p>Canada bought an additional 200,000 doses of adjuvant-free vaccine from Australia when the <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> plant in Ste-Foy, Que., was unable to produce its version quickly enough.</p>
<p>Pregnant women are one of the high-risk groups who can get their shots in the arm before the rest of the country.</p>
<p>The Australian vaccine was approved and became available for pregnant women at flu clinics across the country last week, but Aglukkaq has yet to sign an interim order approving the adjuvant-free vaccine from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>.</p>
<p>That means the domestic version is still unavailable even though the decision to switch the single production line at the Ste-Foy facility over to making the adjuvant-free version in mid-October caused a shortfall in vaccine distribution last week.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada distributed 24,900 doses of the domestic adjuvant-free vaccine nationwide last week and expects to ship an additional 979,300 doses by Sunday, but so far flu clinics have not been allowed to use any of it.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said the doses are being distributed throughout the provinces and territories so that inoculations can begin as soon as the approval comes down.</p>
<p>Ontario received 86,000 doses of the adjuvant-free vaccine last week and is slated to receive another 375,000 doses by Sunday.</p>
<p>David Jensen, a spokesman for the provincial health ministry, said local public health units have not yet reported how many of the Australian adjuvant-free doses have been given.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Private schools say their kids get flu-shot 'priority'; No they don't, says Ontario health officer</b>
</div><div>Theresa Boyle   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>1042 words</div><div>11 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>First there were professional athletes. Then hospital boards. Now students at some private schools have received preferential access to flu shots.</p>
<p>Officials from St. Andrew's College in Aurora, Pickering College in Newmarket and the Hill Academy in Concord acknowledged Tuesday that some students and staff have received the H1N1 vaccine even though they are not among the high-risk groups designated by the province for early shots.</p>
<p>St. Andrew's, an all-boys school, responded to questions from the Star with a written statement, explaining that early vaccination was the "ethically responsible choice" because the risk of transmission is especially high there:</p>
<p>"As a boarding school, we are deemed a high priority group. St. Andrew's residential population consists of 250 students from 25 different countries. This is similar to any confined population, living in close proximity where rate of infection transmission is significantly higher.</p>
<p>"The residential population are considered high risk because of the environment they live in and public health is pleased this group is being protected. However, the residential students' transmission risk to others means we have to vaccinate as many day students and staff as possible to contain the spread."</p>
<p>In fact, private schools and boarding schools are not listed among the province's priority groups and Ontario's top public health official Dr. Arlene King told a news conference Tuesday people must follow the sequencing order because supply of the vaccine is still limited and those at high risk need it first.</p>
<p>Asked specifically about private school students, she said: "Their turn and (that of) the vast majority of the province has not yet come because of the fact that we have not yet had the availability and we have been concentrating on ... the priority groups."</p>
<p>Students could be on the priority list, however, if they have underlying health problems.</p>
<p>King said she has not yet received her shot but hopes to this week.</p>
<p>Dr. Vivek Goel, president of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, indicated illness rates are likely now peaking in Ontario, but said he wouldn't know for sure until data is collected and analyzed.</p>
<p>"We are certainly starting to see this pattern that the tail-end indicators (like) ICUs and hospitalizations went up a few weeks ago and hopefully we will start to see that we are coming out of the peak in the next week or so," he said.</p>
<p>King announced Tuesday the province is making the vaccine available to more people, but not to school-age children as previously stated. Instead, priority groups have been expanded to include people 65 and older who live in long-term care homes and complex continuing care facilities; police, firefighters and correctional staff; and a small number of Ministry of Health staff involved in pandemic response.</p>
<p>They join the six existing priority groups: people under 65 with chronic conditions, pregnant women, children aged 6 months to under 5 years, health-care workers, people living in isolated areas and those living with or caring for people who cannot be vaccinated, such as babies under six months.</p>
<p>King said the priority list is being expanded with three goals in mind: reducing illness and death, reducing social disruption and matching demand with supply.</p>
<p>But a public outcry has erupted over allegations of queue jumping by Maple Leafs and Raptors' players and members of hospital boards. Now students of at least three private schools - where fees range from $13,500 to $49,000 - have been given preferential access.</p>
<p>At Pickering College, the vaccine was made available last week to about 45 boarders, said Laura Mason, a registered nurse with the school who helped give the shots. The shots were facilitated by a local doctor, with the approval of the local health unit, she said.</p>
<p>Mason said these students were deemed to be priority because there had been cases of flu-like illness at the school and one student had tested positive for H1N1.</p>
<p>"They were in contact with a positive case," Mason said.</p>
<p>Public health officials have said that everyone should assume they can be exposed to H1N1 wherever they go. University students who reside in dormitories also live in close proximity to one another but are not considered high priority.</p>
<p>The vaccine was also made available to some students at the Hill Academy, a school for athletes that was attended by 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio, who died last month after contracting the virus.</p>
<p>Public health officials say when a person dies from H1N1, those around that individual are no more at risk of acquiring the virus than if they were exposed to someone who was made only mildly ill from it.</p>
<p>However, "everyone was very concerned," said school CEO Peter Merrill, who took between 15 to 20 students to a public clinic after Evan's death. "We went over to the clinic and said, 'These kids have been around Evan and we are pretty sensitive about it' and they were very respectful of that."</p>
<p>He said that at the time it was not clear whether the students were high priority for the vaccine: "There were a lot of things at play. Not only the health issues but the emotional issues."</p>
<p>King told reporters there have been 52 H1N1-related deaths in the province, up from 37 reported Friday. She said that overall illness is still on the rise across Ontario and more deaths and hospitalizations are expected. But she said there are pockets where infection rates might have already peaked.</p>
<p>King acknowledged the vaccination campaign is going a little slower than expected. She had hoped that 2.2 million Ontarians would have been vaccinated by the end of last week, but the latest numbers show that 1.9 million doses have been given out to providers such as clinics and doctors' offices, but not all of them administered.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper held a conference call Tuesday with the provincial and territorial leaders to talk about H1N1. At Queen's Park, aides to Premier Dalton McGuinty said they welcomed the outreach.</p>

<p>The H1N1 influenza outbreak has helped bolster results of an array of companies, from U.S. drug-store chains to pharmaceutical and packaged goods giants. Consumers are loading up on hand sanitizers, tissues, medications and face masks, helping companies that make or stock those products ring up more sales.</p>
<p>Now it's <span class="companylink">Shoppers Drug Mart Corp</span>.'s turn.</p>
<p>Today Shoppers reports third-quarter financial results, and the H1N1 factor will be top-of-mind. In its formal presentations, Shoppers' executives might not refer to the impact of the spread of H1N1 on the business. That's because its third quarter ended on Oct. 10, and the flu scare didn't hit until the end of the month.</p>
<p>But analysts on the quarterly conference call are bound to ask about it.</p>
<p>“The really big benefit will come in the fourth quarter,” says Robert Gibson, head of research at Octagon Capital Corp. “The big scare only began in the last couple of weeks … I'm seeing people in the subway with surgical masks on. Even if it's not H1N1, this seems to be a bad season for flu. It's a good thing [for Shoppers].”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>By-election win revives Tory hopes in Quebec; With the Bloc Québécois weakened, the Harper government's dream of a majority appears within reach</b>
</div><div>STEVEN CHASE AND DANIEL LEBLANC   </div>
<div>812 words</div><div>11 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- In prying a long-held rural seat from the weakened grasp of the Bloc Québécois, Stephen Harper's Conservatives have shown that their drive to win enough seats for a Parliamentary majority may be less daunting than expected.</p>
<p>The Conservatives, now only 10 seats from a majority, are salivating at the prospect of stealing more seats from the Bloc after a surprise by-election upset in Rivière-du-Loup shattered the expert consensus that the Tories are a spent force in Quebec.</p>
<p>Insiders predict, however, that Prime Minister Harper will continue to view Ontario as the best source of more seats, including the Greater Toronto Area and cities such as Kitchener and London. Monday's two by-election wins – the Tories also reclaimed a Nova Scotia riding – bring the Conservative seat count to 145.</p>
<p>Before the by-elections, the Tories' road to a majority had seemed harder given the lack of potential for seat growth in Quebec.</p>
<p>The former Bloc bastion of Rivière-du-Loup, east of Quebec City on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, fell as the Conservatives persuaded voters that they would be better served by an MP on the government side: former local mayor Bernard Généreux.</p>
<p>But while the Tories may be more inclined to fight a general election after results suggesting their fortunes are undimmed by the recession or the H1N1 outbreak, the returns for the Official Opposition Liberals should cool leader Michael Ignatieff's desire to trigger a national ballot.</p>
<p>The Liberals were never expected to be contenders in any of Monday's four by-elections, but they failed even to make gains in three of the ridings from the party's disastrous showings in 2008.</p>
<p>“The by-election results last night show that we have a lot of work ahead of us,” Mr. Ignatieff said in a brief statement. “Our job in the months ahead is to earn the confidence and support of Canadians.”</p>
<p>Pollster Jean-Marc Léger said the Quebec results, while not earth-moving, suggest that the Tories have momentum again in the 75-seat province.</p>
<p>One year ago, Mr. Harper almost lost power to a Liberal-NDP coalition that had the support of the Bloc and was popular in Quebec. The Tories railed against any deal with the “separatist” Bloc, and the crisis led to a Conservative freefall in Quebec polls that endured into last summer.</p>
<p>“Six months ago, I wouldn't have bet a lot on any Conservative MP in Quebec,” Mr. Léger said.</p>
<p>But the result in Rivière-du-Loup, he said, puts Conservatives back to where they were before the crisis, with “potential for growth.” The Bloc had held the riding since 1993.</p>
<p>He said the Conservatives clearly benefited from sinking Liberal support. In a number of ridings in Quebec, historically, the Bloc has relied on a split in the federalist vote among the Liberals, the NDP and the Conservatives to eke out a victory.</p>
<p>In a bid to explain his party's loss in Rivière-du-Loup, Bloc Leader Gilles Duceppe said in a statement that voters likely expressed their anger over former Bloc MP Paul Crête's early retirement shortly after the last federal election. He vowed to win back Rivière-du-Loup in the next election.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is the 18-year-old Bloc is showing its age. Mr. Duceppe has led the party since 1997.</p>
<p>Separately, NDP Leader Jack Layton lauded his party's hefty win over the Tories in a Vancouver-area seat as a repudiation of the Harper government's role in an unpopular sales tax change in B.C. The Harper government is bankrolling the shift to the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), which will mean increased prices on one in five consumer purchases in British Columbia.</p>
<p>The New Democrats held onto suburban New Westminster-Coquitlam, and even increased their vote share to a 14-point lead over the Conservatives.</p>
<p>Heritage Minister James Moore, a Vancouver-area MP, said while anger at the HST may have motivated NDP voters, he doesn't think it hurt the Tories in New Westminster. The Conservatives' vote share declined 3 percentage points from 2008.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>PM soothes premiers' vaccine worries; Harper vows to tell provinces how much will be available, and when</b>

<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper is vowing that Ottawa will provide the provinces with speedy updates on the H1N1 vaccine after Canada's premiers voiced concerns about confusion over the rollout of supplies.</p>
<p>That promise came during a 50-minute conference call between the first ministers yesterday, a meeting called as flu clinics in several provinces grind to a halt.</p>
<p>The surprise disclosure last week of a sharp drop in the supply of H1N1 vaccine in the near term forced the delay of general immunization programs across the country. Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick have all temporarily shut down some H1N1 clinics for high-priority patients because of supply shortages, and British Columbia is likely to join them by the end of the work week.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with the call say the Prime Minister repeated his government's assertion that Canada's vaccination program is better than those of many other countries. The premiers are keen to know, as early as possible, how many doses of H1N1 vaccine the federal government has, and how many it will be distributing.</p>
<p>The territorial premiers told Mr. Harper that they are happy about how the H1N1 program was rolled out so quickly in their jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach, whose province halted vaccination entirely for four days last week because of supply shortfalls, said the Prime Minister did promise that the federal government will now quickly advise the provinces as supplies become available.</p>
<p>“We had a very good discussion on H1N1,” he said yesterday, adding that the first ministers also discussed the nation's economy and some of the positive indicators of an eventual recovery.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's Office was saying little about the call. “The Prime Minister invited the premiers on a phone call to discuss H1N1 preparedness and the economy. It was a positive and collaborative discussion,” PMO spokesman Dimitri Soudas said.</p>
<p>However, sources familiar with the situation said the premiers had initially approached the Prime Minister about ensuring they have as much information as possible on just how much vaccine is available for the provinces.</p>
<p>The premiers resolved to press the federal government to give them more timely information on vaccine supplies during their own conference call last Friday. Health officials across Canada have expressed frustration that Ottawa has been slow to inform them about how much vaccine provinces and territories will get each week. Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Arlene King, was caught off guard when reporters knew before she did that the federal government planned to release another 1.8 million doses of the vaccine to the provinces this week.</p>
<p>Perry Kendall, B.C.'s Provincial Health Officer, said he believes his province will receive a total of 250,000 doses for use next week – nearly triple the supply of this week – and that nationwide supplies of the vaccine will total nearly two million doses, up from the 436,000 that were shipped for use this week.</p>

<p>VANCOUVER -- Eight people, including an asthmatic woman whose family says she was sent home twice from hospital after having breathing issues, and an eight-year-old child, have died of H1N1 in the past week in British Columbia, the province's health officer said yesterday.</p>
<p>That brings to 23 the number of H1N1 fatalities since last April when the illness began. It compares to 200 to 800 British Columbians who die each year of seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Perry Kendall told a conference call yesterday that each H1N1 death is “regrettable,” but flu-season deaths during a pandemic are not unexpected, though these victims seem younger than is usual for seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>Six of the victims this week were between 40 and 60, one was between 20 and 39, and one was a child. Three, he said, were from the region served by Vancouver Coastal Health, three from Vancouver Island and two from the region served by the Fraser Health Authority.</p>
<p>Dr. Kendall declined to release any details on the individuals, but noted that all had underlying health conditions, including developmental disabilities, cancer, immune-suppression issues, kidney disease and severe asthma.</p>
<p>“That's the expected range of conditions that make people vulnerable,” he said.</p>
<p>While Dr. Kendall, citing patient confidentiality, had little to say about the specifics of the cases, the family of one victim spoke out yesterday.</p>
<p>Tiffany Yung said her mother, Mae Mah, a 51-year-old with asthma, was taken to Richmond Hospital with breathing problems on Oct. 31, assessed and sent home. She was taken back by ambulance on Nov. 1 with fever and sent home with Tylenol after four to six hours.</p>
<p>She suffered cardiac arrest at home on Nov. 1, and died in hospital on Nov. 3, after which Ms. Yung said hospital officials told her that her mother had H1N1. Ms. Mah had two daughters and worked as a <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> cashier.</p>
<p>Ms. Yung said she and her family, which has concerns over the treatment Ms. Mah received at the hospital, might launch legal action.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Vancouver Coastal Health declined comment on the case, citing patient confidentiality.</p>
<p>So did Dr. Kendall, though he acknowledged the case is under review, and said that it might be hard to diagnose H1N1 in someone with asthma.</p>
<p>“All I would say is that my understanding from the emergency room is they have a really high index of suspicions and they would really be pushing to make a diagnosis, a presumptive diagnosis, and treat somebody rather than making a mistake,” he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Kendall said there are signs that cases could be “flattening” out in the next two or three weeks, and urged people to get vaccinated as the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>“Some people are saying pandemics are accompanied by a third wave. If we vaccinate enough people, we won't have a third wave. If we see … people lose interest, we may well have a third wave because we'll have a lot of susceptible people out there,” he said.</p>
<p>“Clearly, there's going to be virus around. We're going to see more infections and the risk is not gone just because we maybe hit a peak.”</p>
<p>Since Nov. 3, there have been 202 new severe cases of H1N1 flagged in British Columbia. Most lab-confirmed cases have been mild or moderate with patients recovering.</p>
<p>Dr. Kendall has said clinics have had to close this week due to problems with the supply of vaccine, but that 250,000 doses are expected this week that will allow vaccinations to continue next week.</p>
<p>Pregnant women and children aged six months to five years are among the priority groups for shots.</p>

<div>H1N1 VACCINATION</div>
<div>Editorial</div>

<p>Let it not be said that Canada pampers its children. Yesterday, Ontario announced a whole slew of “priority groups” that are next up for the H1N1 vaccine. Children still did not make the grade. Who knew that one country could have so many priority groups that children would be sent to the back of the line?</p>
<p>The first priority groups for the H1N1 vaccine were those deemed at the highest risk of death or severe complications. This was defensible. The list included pregnant women, children under five, aboriginal people and health workers.</p>
<p>The second set of priority groups does not follow the logic of the first. Firefighters and police officers are to be inoculated, according to Ontario's chief medical health officer, Arlene King. Are they facing a more severe risk than other adults, or than children? No. Perhaps the idea is to avoid having a majority of officers and firefighters off sick at once. But if that is a realistic fear, isn't it equally realistic that a majority of children might catch the influenza?</p>
<p>Another priority group are front-line workers at detention centres. No doubt it is important to keep the flu out of detention centres, where people live cheek by jowl. But it is also important to keep it out of schools, where people – short people known as children – learn cheek by jowl. If it isn't important to keep the schools flu-free, why the jails?</p>
<p>A third group added to the priority list are people over 65 living in long-term-care homes. This seems contrary to what medical officers of health have been saying about immunity and the elderly. (The U.S. Centers for Disease Control has found partial immunity in one-third of people older than 60.) Certainly it is important to protect vulnerable individuals, especially when they live in clusters. But some children are vulnerable. Alberta, though it has not opened its vaccinations to all children, has at least given priority to children under 10 (and, as of today, 10 to 17) with conditions such as diabetes, obesity and cancer. It is good not to forget the elderly in the rush to protect the young. But where is the rush to protect the young?</p>
<p>Thank goodness for Saskatchewan, which did not require that anyone jump up and down and turn blue in the face before making children a priority. This week it is inoculating those from kindergarten to Grade 6. The province believes the health risk to children is more severe than it is to most other groups. It may be wrong. But what if it is right? Why is Ontario taking a chance? It is not as if it had no doses of vaccine left. It just received a supply of 770,000 on Monday, which could be broken into half-doses for children five to nine. And why are other provinces slow to declare children a “priority group”?</p>
<p>It may be churlish to mention that the Canadian army's detainees in Afghanistan have begun receiving their inoculations. Or to mention the professional hockey and basketball players, or the members of hospital boards. No doubt each had a case to make. The only ones who seem unable to convince the authorities of their case are children.</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- reynolds.globe@gmail.com</p>
<p>In 1993, U.S. President Bill Clinton named James Lee Witt, a friend from Arkansas, as his disaster management guy in Washington. In the next eight years, Mr. Clinton declared 348 disasters in 6,500 counties of 50 states, setting an all-time record for calamities of national importance. By all accounts an able administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Mr. Witt was also remarkably candid. Testifying once before a Senate committee in 1996, he forthrightly declared: “All disasters are political events.”</p>
<p>He was quite right, as U.S. and Canadian experience demonstrates in slightly different ways. What else would you expect? When you nationalize a thing, you politicize it. When you nationalize a thing, you remove it from local or regional control. And when you nationalize a thing, you hand responsibility for it to federal bureaucracies.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, Canadians have witnessed these consequences close up – most vividly with opposition MPs trying to exploit a global flu pandemic, such as it is, for partisan advantage. But Canadians got independent confirmation of these consequences last week in Auditor-General Sheila Fraser's report on Public Safety Canada, the federal super-department established in 2003 to manage national disasters. Although she did not opine specifically on the government's H1N1 flu management, she did note that Public Safety Canada, the federal bureaucracy responsible for it, hadn't yet started – after six years – to do its job.</p>
<p>When you nationalize a thing, you goose it, too – creating a kind of disaster inflation. It is a safe bet that Canada will experience more and more pandemics in the years ahead. The definition of a pandemic will be dumbed down. Higher levels of panic will occur at lower levels of physical risk. Public Safety Canada's need for more personnel will inevitably increase.</p>
<p>What else, after all, would you expect? In a research paper published at the same time as Canada was establishing Public Safety Canada, two notable American economists – Thomas Garrett, senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and Russell Sobel, an economics professor at West Virginia University – documented the dramatic consequences of nationalizing U.S. disaster relief.</p>
<p>“[P]residential and congressional influences affect the rate of disaster declaration and the allocation of FEMA disaster expenditures across states,” Mr. Garrett and Prof. Sobel reported. “States politically important to the president have a higher rate of disaster declaration by the president, and disaster expenditures are higher in states having congressional representation on FEMA oversight committees. Our models predict that nearly half of all disaster relief is motivated politically rather than by need. The findings … question the relative effectiveness of government relief versus private disaster relief.”</p>
<p>This is a shocking conclusion suggesting that the United States would have been better off to leave disaster relief to such voluntary agencies as the Red Cross and to private philanthropy – as it had done effectively enough from 1776 through 1988 when federal legislation known as the Stafford Act made the president responsible for declaring disasters and managing them. The U.S. government now pays as much as 100 per cent of the eligible costs of disaster relief. (In Canada, the federal government pays a maximum of 70 per cent.)</p>
<p>The U.S. has experienced severe disaster inflation since the Stafford Act went into effect. The average number of disasters from 1983 through 1988 was 25. The average number from 1989 through 1994 was 41. President George Bush the Elder averaged 39 disasters a year; Mr. Clinton averaged 72. In 1996, his second-term election year, Mr. Clinton declared 157 disasters, a record that still stands – though President George Bush the Younger came close in 2008 with 143.</p>
<p>Before 1996, the United States had never officially experienced more than 56 natural disasters in a single year. It has experienced 100 or more in each year since. More significant perhaps is the impact of “disaster declarations” on presidential elections. Economists Garrett and Sobel calculated that a disaster declaration in any state, in an election year, was worth an extra 1.7 per cent of the votes cast When an ice storm hit Connecticut in 2003, causing $2.5-million (U.S.) in damage, Mr. Bush declined to declare a disaster; when a rainstorm hit Florida six months later, causing $600,000 in damage (to 40 houses), he declared a disaster. In the toss-up state that narrowly determined his presidency in 2000, no one needed to ask why.</p>
<p>Canadians should reflect on the U.S. experience before we engage irrevocably in the further nationalization of the disaster industry. Most disasters are local affairs, requiring local action. According to Craig Fugate, President Barack Obama's disaster guy, who was interviewed for the September issue of The Atlantic magazine, if the federal government does more, local people do less; Americans now expect the government to reimburse them for their sodden carpets.</p>
<p>The federal government can occasionally act as an insurance agent of last resort. We should not, however, make it our national carpet cleaner.</p>

<div>National Post</div>

</p>
<p>The city paid nearly double the normal rate for hand sanitizer when it bought multiple bottles for all staff in a rush purchase during the first wave of the H1N1 epidemic, outraged councillors said yesterday.</p>
<p>Councillor Cesar Palacio (Davenport) questioned whether the city got the best price by placing a $645,645 (including tax) single-source order at the height of the crisis when it didn't even need the bottles immediately.</p>
<p>Summoned to explain the order, city purchasing staff told a council committee they spent $539,000 on 208,320 bottles of sanitizer, enough to give 50,000 workers up to four bottles each.</p>
<p>Mr. Palacio checked with various suppliers and did the math: "Each case has 36 bottles of 115 ml. The city bought it at $74 a case. Now if the same amount was bought by a manufacturer, the cost would have been reduced to $55.80, and that meant $1.50 a bottle as opposed to $2.59 the city paid.</p>
<p>"The city could have bought all this hand sanitizer for $322,000, instead of $565,000 [including tax], and that means we could have saved $217,000 for taxpayers if the city had gone to a manufacturer instead of a wholesaler or retailer."</p>
<p>The order for Coloplast Isagel brand antimicrobial gel from wholesaler <span class="companylink">Guillevin International Co</span>. was placed last April, but the individual bottles only started landing on desks in the past few weeks as the second wave of H1N1 struck. Another $77,112 was spent on 12,000 larger 354 ml pump bottles.</p>
<p>Some councillors questioned why the city needs to supply workers with individual bottles of disinfectant at all.</p>
<p>Councillor Karen Stintz (Eglinton Lawrence) called the decision "insanity."</p>
<p>"It's one thing to put bottles of sanitizer at the front door where people are walking through and in the kitchens and the washrooms where people should be reminded to wash their hands frequently. There is no reason that every single employee should have received hand sanitizer," she said.</p>
<p>Rob Andrusevic, a spokesman for the city, said the purchase cost was a result of supply and demand. When the order was placed in April, Toronto had to take what it could get.</p>
<p>"We paid a market-value price based on what was happening at that time," he explained. "H1N1 was prevalent globally so essentially when the city went out to look for hand sanitizer we found that many of our vendors were out and could not meet the quantity the city was looking to obtain. That was a key reason for the sole-sourcing was they had to move quickly and secure the size of supply that we needed and make sure we had it."</p>
<p>Toronto council approved a $5.5-million pandemic preparedness plan last spring for supplies ranging from Tamiflu to protective gear to the hand sanitizer. Mr. Andrusevic said the Medical Officer of Health recommended outfitting every employee with their own bottle of disinfectant gel as a flu prevention tactic.</p>
<p>"Staff and the public need easy access to hand sanitizer to reduce the transmission of influenza. An individual bottle is something that a staff person could take with them on the job, so it's not locked to a specific location," he said. "Some people work at different locations, some people work out in the field, so a communal station may not be an option for them. Individual containers also allows someone to use it as they need it and have quick access to it."</p>
<p>Councillor Doug Holyday (Etobicoke Centre) said he is not happy with the large expenditure, but "hindsight is 20/20."</p>
<p>"If the pandemic had broken out in a different way and a lot of people were sick and we didn't have it, I guess we'd be hearing the other side of the coin here," he said. "You're damned if you do and damned if you don't."</p>
<p>Still, he questioned the necessity of the huge quantity bought and wondered whether it will all get used.</p>
<p>"I think you could, first off, make it available for those who will use it. Some people aren't even going to use it. They're going to end up probably throwing it in the desk drawer and when they retire we'll find it there," he predicted.</p>
<p>"Next week they're supposed to be back with more... If you want to have a refill, at least make you do something like bring back the empty bottle or something."</p>

<p>I have a catheter because I'm waiting for prostate surgery. The catheter has been in now for three weeks.</p>
<p>Of course I am unable to work, so the government is losing tax revenue from me.</p>
<p>I have had three visits to the hospital, once to have the catheter put in, once because of excessive bleeding and once because, as the hospital warned was likely, I had an infection. (To soften the blow about getting the infection, the doctor told me it was most likely picked up at the time of insertion.)</p>
<p>And this is just in the first three weeks of my catheter time.</p>
<p>That's three hospital visits which should not have been needed. All were through emergency, to the involved reception, triage, nurses and doctors.</p>
<p>And I still need surgery, and the medical people say I will likely be back with other infections and problems.</p>
<p>Health Minister Kevin Falcon has said that, with the H1N1 problems, avoiding unnecessary hospital visits is a good idea. I have been three times that should have not have been necessary because of surgical wait times.</p>

<p>No immunization clinics are scheduled for today on the Island, but they resume tomorrow in Nanaimo, Port Alberni, Port Renfrew and Victoria at Hillside Centre.</p>
<p>Eligibility remains the same. They are listed in the box below this story.</p>
<p>Suzanne Germain, spokeswoman for the Vancouver Island Health Authority, said clinics yesterday at Hillside Centre and the Mormon Church at 701 Mann Ave. were not busy compared to earlier days -- possibly because the target groups have now mostly had their shots.</p>
<p>Local doctors are organizing a free forum on H1N1 to answer questions about the disease and vaccine. The forum is scheduled for Nov. 19, 7 p.m. at the Lambrick Park Church, 1780 Feltham Rd. A family doctor and infectious-disease specialist will be on hand to answer questions.</p>

<p>Provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall admits he wishes a higher proportion of British Columbia residents were satisfied with the way the H1N1 immunization program is unfolding across the province.</p>
<p>He took time yesterday during his weekly update on the flu to comment on a new Angus Reid poll indicating that Canadians are critical of the way governments have dealt with the pandemic.</p>
<p>In the online survey of 1,003 Canadian adults, only 36 per cent said they are satisfied with pandemic preparedness. B.C. was higher than the national average at 50 per cent.</p>
<p>In this province, only eight per cent of poll respondents said they had gotten immunized as of last Thursday, which varies from the evidence that about 20 per cent of the population has been vaccinated. (The survey only polled adults, which helps to explain the contradiction).</p>
<p>Kendall said he still has not been vaccinated against H1N1 himself because he is not in a high-risk group getting vaccine priority.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>It's more than a hunch for Buono, it's Smart; Returning kicks in practice, should play</b>
</div><div>Lowell Ullrich   </div>
<div>The Province</div>
<div>388 words</div><div>11 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A50</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>There are few low-percentage moves made by Wally Buono each year around the playoffs, but the coach of the Lions tried to suggest Tuesday he was going against conventional wisdom by bringing back Ian Smart to face the Hamilton Tiger-Cats Sunday.</p>
<p>A healthy active-roster scratch since September and effectively sidelined since July, Smart was returning kicks at practice and the coach of the CFL team said it is his intention to put him back in the lineup.</p>
<p>"Just a hunch," Buono said. "Ryan Grice-Mullen has given us a lift [on returns] and my instincts tell me [Smart] will be good."</p>
<p>It may be a hunch, but absent Tuesday was import Michael Bumpus, who has been diagnosed with the H1N1 flu virus and returned to his suburban Seattle home. Definitely no longer part of the plan is tailback A.J. Harris, who was released off the practice roster last week and was not offered a 2010 contract.</p>
<p>Seeing is believing</p>
<p>Another Buono bromide: "I don't believe what I hear. I believe what I see."</p>
<p>The coach saw enough from Casey Printers Tuesday to make him think his starting quarterback will not be bothered by his hand problem, even if Printers remains slightly dubious.</p>
<p>Printers had a few moments in practice early where his throwing hand appeared to cause him some discomfort, but otherwise threw effectively. So did Travis Lulay, who will serve as a backup after saying his injured shoulder has improved.</p>
<p>"It's the best it's felt by far," Lulay said. Returning to work after a six-week absence was Jarious Jackson, who figures to be the Lions' third-down quarterback.</p>
<p>Honour is due</p>
<p>A mistake admitted by Buono last year will be corrected when the club practises on Remembrance Day.</p>
<p>The coach said the Lions will be finished outdoor work by 11 a.m. this morning.</p>
<p>Last season, the club played loud music in order to simulate game conditions at practice, and reacted when it was pointed out the noise could be heard at nearby ceremonies adjacent to their practice facility.</p>
<p>"I was callous and a little disrespectful," the coach said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sanitizers have a real champion; H1N1 prompts boost in supply</b>
</div><div>Dave Hall   </div>
<div>The Windsor Star</div>
<div>770 words</div><div>11 November 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>C9 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Anticipating a run on alcohol-based hand sanitizers resulting from H1N1 action plans across the province, a local company has ramped up production and is now supplying its product to school boards and other institutions and businesses across Ontario.</p>
<p>Champion Products manufactures Sani Touch, a hand sanitizer, and Bio Spray, a version for hard surfaces, at its PCS Products plant in Emeryville. It sold 8,000 bottles of the hand sanitizer in September and October alone.</p>
<p>"The need for antiviral alcohol-based products is growing exponentially," said Champion's Graham Clayton. "It's taken off far faster than anticipated because the incidence of HIN1 is more widespread than anyone expected."</p>
<p>Clayton said that according to weekly statistical reports issued by the Public Health Agency of Canada, there were 14 deaths associated with H1N1 between Nov 3 and Nov. 5, bringing the total since the flu first hit Canada to 115.</p>
<p>In a series of graphs published by the same agency up to the end of October, widespread influenza activity, outbreaks and influenza-like illnesses have spiked dramatically in the past month.</p>
<p>"About 99 per cent of people catch the regular flu and while it's miserable, you get over it," said Clayton. "But for a fraction of the remaining one per cent, it can really knock you off your feet and in some cases can cause death."</p>
<p>According to a number of research studies, the correct use of hand sanitizers accompanied by regular handwashing can cut the risk of contracting the flu.</p>
<p>Use of such products can reduce the amount of bacteria on skin and can also reduce the length of time that bacteria can remain on skin compared to just soap and water.</p>
<p>"It hasn't been a big product for us in the past but we ramped up production this year and we've already shipped to school boards in Lambton-Kent, Ottawa District and Renfrew District," said Clayton. "We've sent flyers to all area school boards and other institutions informing them we have an ample supply if needed."</p>
<p>Scott Scantlebury, a spokes-man for the Greater Essex County District School Board, said his employer ordered additional supplies early in the school year in anticipation of a flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"In the past, we'd used the non-alcohol variety but we've since switched to the alcohol-based following a new set of directives from the board," said Scantlebury. "We have dispensers in all supervised common areas such as classrooms, cafeterias, gymnasiums and offices.</p>
<p>"I think we spent somewhere in the neighbourhood of $60,000 through a grant from the government and we were consequently able to order more than usual."</p>
<p>Ron Foster, a spokesman for Windsor Regional Hospital, said "we have ample supply and as you can imagine we use a huge volume because we have dispensers in lobbies, elevators, common areas and every patient room on two campuses.</p>
<p>"With handwashing now a part of the culture here and the use of sanitizers, we've been able to cut the risk of infection considerably."</p>
<p>Foster said the hospital buys its sanitizer products through Medical Mart, a Mississauga-based supplier which deals in large industrial-size quantities and dispensers with distribution centres in Windsor, Edmonton and Dartmouth.</p>
<p>Champion's products are 70 per cent alcohol-based and come in scented and unscented versions in a variety of sizes from 250 millilitre desktop dispensers to four-litre jugs. It also contains moisturizers and conditioners.</p>
<p>"We've put on special runs of the unscented version for some groups," said Clayton. "And because we're local, we can turn large orders around in a matter of days."</p>
<p>Clayton said the company's BioSpray product is also in large demand with regular customers.</p>
<p>"Bacteria can stay on hard surfaces for up to two days compared to five minutes or so on hands," said Clayton. "Spraying down hard surfaces is essential for restaurants, delicatessens, cafeterias, butcher shops and anywhere where bacteria can collect."</p>
<p>Champion filled 16,000 bottles during its latest production run and has supplied its product for the City of Toronto's pandemic plan stockpiles.</p>
<p>"Right now, we're sitting on about 200,000 litres of it and we've had to import about 100,000 pump tops from China to keep up with the dispenser demand because that's where the production bottleneck was occurring."</p>

<p>When I was a teenager going to high school, we prepared to occupy a fallout shelter presumably to survive a nuclear war. We would chatter about filling a lifeboat and decide who should live and who would be lost. We were raised in a society that respected honour and duty and made no fuss about giving up our place to survive for the good of others.</p>
<p>I would observe that today's crisis of survival is characterized by entitlement and outrage. Why is there so much indignation about who is getting the H1N1 shots first? It is ironic that this issue is occurring during Remembrance Day.</p>

<p>Too bad the people in our family aren't VIP hockey players or hospital board members. Maybe we wouldn't have come down with a suspected case of H1N1 flu last week because we could have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Instead, we're just rank and file and, thankfully, otherwise healthy. Since Canada has a two-tier health care system -- despite its claim to universal health care -- we, like the rest of our kind, stood in line for a shot and were turned away. Instead, we got the flu.</p>
<p>The LaSalle Vipers hockey team was vaccinated last week because one of the players contracted H1N1, necessitating "immediate action," said a spokesperson. Some Hotel-Dieu Grace Hospital board members were immunized because they're at the hospital often and exposed to the virus, a spokesperson said. Lots of people are jumping the queue -- the Calgary Flames, their B.C. farm team, a Moncton hockey team, numerous Toronto hospital boards, rich Montreal hospital donors. Even Afghan detainees at Kandahar Airfield were reported to be getting the shot today. Shows you where the rank and file stands.</p>
<p>A player on our sons' novice hockey team had H1N1, but the rest of the team can't get the shot. One of our kids had suspected H1N1 last week, but her class can't get the shot, either. And that's the way it should be.</p>
<p>We can't inoculate everyone because we don't have enough vaccine. So only those facing higher risk should get the shot. That means a higher risk of developing serious illness from H1N1, not simply a higher risk of being exposed to it. By the end of flu season, we'll all be exposed to it.</p>
<p>What's just as disturbing as all this queue-jumping is the response here by our local chief public health doctor, Allen Heimann. Heads rolled in Calgary when the Flames got the shot. It was a bonafide scandal, and two people were fired.</p>
<p>Here, Heimann appears to be shrugging his shoulders. He told The Star he doesn't know which doctor gave the Vipers the vaccine because no one will tell him. The team will have to deal with the backlash, he said.</p>
<p>I couldn't believe it when I read that. It's the local public health unit that distributes the vaccine here. Hospitals and doctors who receive it sign agreements saying they will immunize high-risk groups first. They also have to keep records. Inoculating people not in high-risk groups -- as a vaccine shortage loomed and the pandemic escalated -- breaches that agreement.</p>
<p>The doctor who provided the vaccine to the Vipers should be held accountable, and it shouldn't take a CSI investigation to do that.</p>
<p>The case of Hotel-Dieu Grace board members is less clear. But at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, the doctor who told board members to get the shot -- when public health officials were advising that only the most vulnerable get it -- had the decency to admit he erred.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I took my daughter to Windsor Regional Hospital last week. She had a sore throat and felt achy and was flushed and hot with fever. "Oh, the flu," concluded the doctor, nonchalantly. I'm worried about H1N1, I told him. And then it started. That has been so overblown! he began. It's Y2K all over again! It's the media's fault!</p>
<p>The media's fault? Public health officials have been urging people to be immunized, scrambling to dispel myths about the virus and the vaccine. The day my daughter fell ill, Canada's top public health doctor told a news conference that the number of hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions due to H1N1 had tripled in the last week and to expect more illness and deaths.</p>
<p>"Prevention remains our goal, to have all Canadians immunized," he said. To reinforce that message, the government ran full-page ads the next two days in 125 newspapers across Canada. Our family doctor is calling high-risk patients to tell them to get the shot.</p>
<p>If you have flu symptoms, you can't get into Windsor Regional's ER without washing your hands and wearing a mask.</p>
<p>While it's alarming that H1N1, unlike seasonal influenza, targets young, healthy people, it's true that most cases are mild. We should be thankful for that. If this was smallpox, the rank and file would be in trouble. As one reader wrote, "I would hate to be a pregnant woman on the Titanic with these hockey teams."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Why aren't seniors an H1N1 priority? critics ask; Quebec accused of discrimination; People over 65 and chronically ill likely won't get vaccine for three weeks</b>
</div><div>CHARLIE FIDELMAN    </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>741 words</div><div>10 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>Senior citizens left off the government's swine-flu vaccination priority list say they are victims of discrimination.</p>
<p>With the average age of those dying from H1N1 complication in Quebec being 63.9, many seniors have called The Gazette to say the vaccine priorities are "criminal" and one person suggested it was "Canada's new pension plan."</p>
<p>Most of those who have succumbed to swine flu have had underlying health issues, yet seniors over 65 - a group known to have multiple health problems - have been left off the roster until the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>Quebec announced yesterday that seniors with chronic illnesses will be the next targeted group, right after the 5-19 age group, which is to start getting the shot in most regions of the province as of today.</p>
<p>It should take about three weeks before those over 65 and chronically ill finally get to roll up their sleeves, health officials said, advancing their schedule by about one week.</p>
<p>"It's completely absurd," said Luc Vallerand, director-general of the Association québécoise des retraité(e)s des secteurs public et parapublic. "If I am 63 and have asthma, I can be in the priority group, but if I'm 65 and older I would have to wait another three weeks."</p>
<p>Moving the schedule ahead for chronically ill seniors by one week is "pure improvisation," Vallerand said.</p>
<p>Many in the field are also asking the same questions about seniors and vaccines, said Richard Schabas, Ontario's chief medical officer of health from 1987 until 1997.</p>
<p>"My understanding of the data is that the rates of infection are low in the elderly, but the rates of complications are very high. The net result is the elderly actually are among the highest risk groups," Schabas, head of the Hastings and Prince Edward Counties Health Unit, said in an interview. "Aside from tiny babies, people over 65 have the highest mortality rate from H1N1. A lot of us have been asking, 'Why are they not included as a priority group?' "</p>
<p>Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to minimize suffering and death from influenza. Most clinics in Ontario have not been refusing to immunize seniors, Schabas said.</p>
<p>"They are not a priority, but certainly at my health unit and I think it's true of most health units, people haven't been turning them away," he said.</p>
<p>Vaccine shortages, long lineups, queue-jumpers and debates about who qualifies for priorities have plagued the campaign from the start.</p>
<p>Similar snags hit the campaign in the United States as well. Last week, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the U.S.Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, tried to calm impending vaccine wars with an open letter to health authorities reiterating priorities for those most vulnerable to the virus:</p>
<p>"Pregnant women, caretakers of infants less than 6 months of age, health-care workers, children and adults with health conditions such as asthma or diabetes, and people under the age of 25," Frieden said</p>
<p>At a news briefing earlier in Quebec City, Alain Poirier, Quebec's public health director, said seniors are a priority.</p>
<p>But so far 50 per cent of infections were in younger people, pregnant women, and those with underlying health conditions, whereas in seniors the infection rate was five per cent, Poirier said.</p>
<p>"Which is why seniors are going to be the next group vaccinated. We're looking at the risk - we know there is a risk - but they are not forgotten."</p>
<p>Quebec has 694 confirmed cases of H1N1, including 433 in the last seven days.</p>
<p>At least 10 people have died since the second wave was declared Aug. 30. Officials are investigating the possibility of an 11th victim.</p>
<p>At least 622 schools have reported an absentee rate higher than 10 per cent, but no schools have closed.</p>
<p>About 10,000 people jam provincial emergency rooms daily, but officials expect some relief in the ER now that the swine flu clinics have opened to treat virus complication.</p>
<p>Officials suggest that people seeking inoculations or treatment consult the provincial website for information on vaccine availability ( http://vaccination.msss.gouv.qc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca[http://vaccination.msss.gouv.qc.ca]) before heading out because quantities vary from centre to centre and region to region.</p>

</p>
<p>The lingering effects of the recession will drag profits down more than 20 per cent this year across most of the six Canadian industries covered by the Conference Board of Canada's industrial profile, the Ottawa-based think-tank said yesterday.</p>
<p>"All industries are grappling with the effects of reduced demand and downward pressure on prices as a result of the recession," said Michael Burt, associate director of industrial economic trends.</p>
<p>"The end result is reduced sales and profitability in nearly every industry covered in these reports, with the transportation and wholesale trade industries being the most affected. On the upside, the recession has lowered input prices and limited wage growth, reducing cost pressures."</p>
<p>The board was optimistic that transportation, and wholesale and retail trade would post profit growth once the recession fades, but said the accommodation sector could face a shaky recovery because of H1N1 flu.</p>

</p>
<p>Last month a pollster asked Canadians to identify the key strength of our health-care system. An astonishing 90 per cent chose the fact that it is accessible to everyone, free, thanks to the taxpayer.</p>
<p>Ninety per cent is a huge endorsement for a system that has periodically forced people with life-threatening diseases and conditions to wait for care, sometimes past the point of safety.</p>
<p>Everyone who thinks about it accepts, we suppose, that the first-come-first-served principle is not absolute. Who can doubt that the well-connected can get a vital test, or a specialist appointment, more rapidly than someone farther down the social ladder? Still, the idea of fairness, coupled with a belief that the system can respond rapidly when a serious medical problem arises in a patient, is at the heart of Canada's well-supported medicare system.</p>
<p>Yet as authorities have tried to roll out the H1N1 vaccine so as to give priority to those most at risk from this flu, we began to hear of various instances in which healthy, low-risk individuals or groups managed to elbow their way to the front of the line.</p>
<p>Hockey teams - from the Calgary Flames to some B.C. junior teams - were inoculated. Healthy adults under 65 are supposed to be in the very last group to receive the H1N1 vaccine, not the first. What made the case of the Flames worse is that their families and staff were also inoculated.</p>
<p>Last weekend reports emerged of board members, donors, and/or non-medical staff of at least seven Toronto hospitals and several in Montreal being given the vaccine out of turn. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Arlene King, was forced to spell out last week to hospital board members that they are not in fact health-care workers, and therefore not entitled to an early shot. Hospital boards claimed to be happy to have the situation explained.</p>
<p>Public demand for the vaccine now seems to have fallen off somewhat, doubtless partly because we're hearing of few deaths. But that doesn't make reports of queue-jumping any easier to bear.</p>
<p>In many places, officials have now tightened access, to make sure that priority groups are inoculated first. And scrutiny by the media,has intensified.</p>
<p>That's good news. It's easier for people to do the right thing when there's some shame attached to doing the wrong one.</p>

<p>No flu shot lineups in Europe</p>
<p>- Nov. 7</p>
<p>Our health care system fails us. I was very upset after reading the Canadian Press article regarding how other nations deal with problem of this H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>Here in Canada people line up to get the shots for hours and in the process might get another type of flu, but when they finally get there, they are told that they are not a high risk.</p>
<p>We are supposed to have such a superior health care system, so who is dragging his feet? Why don't they have to line up for shots in Europe? Do we care less for the health of our people than they do?</p>
<p>There are many questions, and it is high time that we got some answers and action to remedy this problem.</p>
<p>All levels of our governments spend millions of dollars on all sorts of studies, often ridiculous studies. Why on Earth don't they spend some money on a worthwhile study that would correct the problems in our health care system? Any volunteers?</p>

<p>KITCHENER</p>
<p>KITCHENER - People who work at the downtown Kitchener courthouse were shocked and saddened Monday to hear of the death of a popular courthouse fixture who came down with HIN1.</p>
<p>Peter Hulme, 40, could be found most days in his wheelchair outside courtroom 107 at the Frederick Street courthouse, chatting or debating with someone. He worked for three local defence lawyers, doing adjournments for their clients.</p>
<p>He'd become fast friends with lawyers,Crown attorneys and other court staff who lined up at a Cambridge funeral home to pay their respects.</p>
<p>His mother confirmed that he was tested and found to have HIN1.</p>
<p>Hulme came down with pneumonia early last week and was admitted to hospital Tuesday. He'd had the HIN1 shot several days before he died on Friday.</p>
<p>His brother, Scott, said he thought he was getting better. But he developed insomnia and couldn't sleep for several nights in a row.</p>
<p>"I'm in shock. I think we all are," said criminal lawyer Amy Reier who considered Hulme a good friend.</p>
<p>It wasn't the first time that Hulme, a paraplegic, had become sick and developed pneumonia. He'd missed work before. But he always bounced back.</p>
<p>This time, "His body just wasn't able to beat it," said lawyer Hal Mattson, who, along with two other lawyers, hired Hulme about five years ago.</p>
<p>Hulme may have spent most of his life in a wheelchair, but his disability doesn't even come up in conversations with those who knew him.</p>
<p>They talk about his love for a good cigar and a lively party, the time he went out club-hopping and dancing with a female lawyer, and the day he ventured out on a sailboat alone on Conestoga Lake. He controlled the rudder by using his chin controls. He had a university degree in psychology, loved playing hockey and had been married to a woman he met on a chat line. He liked to tease lawyers.</p>
<p>"To me, he was a very joyous and entertaining fellow to have around a courtroom,'' Mattson said. "This is a very morbid place, and to have someone as enthused about life as he was very refreshing for all of us.</p>
<p>"After a while, you almost forgot he was disabled."</p>
<p>Hulme was born with a tumour on his spine and was in a wheelchair by age eight.</p>
<p>But from an early age, "He wanted to try everything,'' said his brother, Michael. "He was not the type of person who sat back.</p>
<p>"To Pete, it was all fun," said his brother, Scott.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Mark Poland was one of several Crowns at the funeral home.</p>
<p>"I found the guy to be such an inspiring guy,'' he said. "He just handled his life with such grace. It's a testimony to the man's spirit.</p>
<p>"He was just a good fit at the courthouse. He was just a fixture. He'll be sorely missed."</p>
<p>He lived at an independent living apartment in Waterloo where he had help to get ready and out the door in the mornings. It seemed he rarely stayed home.</p>
<p>He played hockey by attaching a stick to his footrest.</p>
<p>One of his greatest moments was when he represented Team Canada at the World Electric</p>
<p>Wheelchair Hockey Championships in Holland in 1998.</p>
<p>"Bringing down barriers, that was his life," said his brother, Scott.</p>
<p>He went to movies and dinner with lawyer Amy Reier. She smiles remembering the Saturday night they went out clubbing.</p>
<p>They just hopped on a bus and went from place to place.</p>
<p>They ended up at Club Abstract, dancing to heavy metal music. Hulme used his mouth controls to move the wheelchair in time with the beat.</p>
<p>"He'd move it from side to side. He loved it," Rieir said. "We had a great time."</p>
<p>Lawyer Craig Parry said Hulme was never a victim and never complained.</p>
<p>"He just lived his life and that's what made you like him," Parry said. "I think he felt quite at home around here. He was just one of the guys."</p>
<p>He attended many of the lawyers' social events, occasionally nursing a hangover the next day.</p>
<p>"He could be as fun and as crazy as the rest of us," Mattson said.</p>
<p>Lawyer Stephanie Krug said he was very intelligent and always up for a good debate. He wanted to become a lawyer.</p>
<p>"Nothing ever held him back, from what I saw," she said.</p>
<p>His marriage to a woman from Arkansas lasted several years after they found common interests on a chat line. But they fought too much and ended up splitting amicably, said his brother, Michael.</p>
<p>For people used to seeing Hulme outside courtroom 107, there will be an empty space.</p>
<p>"It's sad to have to close his file," said lawyer Sean Safa, one of many at the courthouse who will miss him.</p>
<p>Peter Hulme, a paraplegic who worked for local defence lawyers, died Friday. Family photo    </p>

<p>The Guelph Wellness Initiative has cancelled the baseline clinics it had arranged for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday this week for participants of the project.</p>
<p>Registered nurses who had volunteered to measure participants at the clinics have been called away to staff emergency H1N1 flu clinics. Baseline clinics can't be run without registered nurses.</p>
<p>Clinics will be rescheduled in the next few months. Participants will be notified when the new dates are set.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Public health boards may begin immunizing the general public as early as next week.</p>
<p>Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health was busy Monday trying to complete planning its best approach for the two weeks ahead. "We're just trying to sort out where we go next," communications manager Jan Craig said Monday.</p>
<p>This week in generally, Ontario's health boards, facing limited supplies of vaccine, are focusing in large part on ensuring inoculation of high risk groups like health care workers, pregnant women and those with chronic illnesses in priority sequence.</p>
<p>Queen's Park should quickly begin setting up H1N1 clinics in schools for all schoolchildren, the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario urged Monday. President Sam Hammond said quite a few schools are "seeing rising levels of absenteeism."</p>
<p>But the local public health board wasn't in a position Monday to comment as it prepares to roll out clinics for the general public.</p>
<p>"We are looking at our next week . . . preparing for our next phase," Craig said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, people feeling ill are encouraged to see health care professionals at area flu assessment clinics in Guelph and Orangeville. They're among about 30 that opened last week.</p>
<p>The Guelph site, 65 Delhi Street, is open 2 to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, same as the Orangeville location at 150 Rolling Hills Drive (adjacent the Headwaters Health Care Centre's acute care hospital there).</p>
<p>"We've been getting between 40 and 50 visits a day," hospital communications manager Ann Cain said Monday.</p>
<p>"It helps divert some people from the emergency department, so they can treat more serious cases," Cain said.</p>
<p>Assessment centres also reduce wait times, a benefit to both hospitals and sick people.</p>
<p>"When you're not feeling well, you don't want to be waiting a long time," Cain said.</p>
<p>The Guelph assessment centre, overseen by Ross Kirkconnell, is seeing 40 to 45 people a day, mainly for flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"It's busy," Kirkconnell said. "I would say this is a really good idea for our community." It's keeping people out of emergency departments and doctors' offices, he said.</p>
<p>But "a few" have been sent over to the emergency department for followup care over concerns they may be infected with more serious cases of influenza than those only requiring care at home and, perhaps, medical prescriptions, Kirkconnell noted.</p>

<p>I recognize the seriousness of H1N1, and will likely get a flu shot in due time. But I won’t do so when I have to wait in lineups sitting on a lawn chair and dealing with police having to control the mobs.</p>
<p>I’m beginning to think the public has lost their rational minds.</p>
<p>The odds of dying from H1N1, as says CBC Radio are one in 250,000 - which in our country of approximately 33 million, that translates to about 130 people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, how many people are going to die from cancer, the complications from diabetes, and from heart disease? Many, many times more.</p>
<p>So why aren’t people lined up at the gym or on the hiking trails, and why aren’t they throwing away their cartons of cigarettes and why aren’t they lined up at the fresh foods section of the grocery store? Why aren’t we concerned about what obesity is doing to our quality of life?</p>
<p>For all of those who are making idiots of themselves pushing and shoving in the H1N1 lines in reaction to endless media reports, are you doing what you should about taking charge of your health? We have control over the real killers.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Canadians have been lining up to get an H1N1 flu shot, but it may not be just themselves and their family members they have to worry about when it comes to contracting the virus.</p>
<p>Some pets may also be susceptible to the disease.</p>
<p>U.S. officials confirmed last week that a 13-year-old cat was infected with swine flu. The domestic shorthair was treated at Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine and has recovered.</p>
<p>"We've known certainly it's possible this could happen," said Tom Skinner, of the U.S Centers for Disease Control. "This may be the first instance where we have documentation that transmission occurred involving cats or dogs."</p>
<p>Swine flu was also confirmed in two pet ferrets in Oregon and Nebraska. Stormy, one of four pet ferrets owned by a Nebraska family, died after all the animals contracted H1N1 influenza from their owners.</p>
<p>Scott Weese, an expert in zoonotic diseases at the University of Guelph, said the animal cases underscore the need for owners of companion animals to realize that "pets are part of the household microbiologically, not just socially."</p>
<p>"If you have an infectious disease, you try not to transmit it to your family members, and your pets should be part of that."</p>
<p>Weese said there are no hard data on which species of pets are vulnerable to H1N1 influenza, but ferrets, which are often used as a research model for human infectious diseases, are likely the pets most vulnerable to certain flu strains.</p>
<p>"One of the big questions is pet birds and pet pot-bellied pigs," he said. "Pet birds and pet pot-bellied pigs would be the next ones I'd be worried about because we know that these are susceptible to influenza."</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the most common pets in Canadian households -- dogs and cats -- Weese said felines are likely at higher risk for H1N1 than canines.</p>
<p>"We know that cats are susceptible to some influenza viruses. We know with H5N1 avian flu, cats can become infected, cats can get sick from it and cats can also shed the virus."</p>
<p>Dogs have their own influenza, and there is little concern about Fido infecting humans or vice versa, he said.</p>
<p>Still, "we never say never with an infectious disease," said Weese.</p>
<p>He said horses fall prey to an equine flu that doesn't affect humans. But then there are all the other animals that people share their domestic lives with -- from rabbits and gerbils to reptiles and rodents.</p>
<p>"And we know virtually nothing about a lot of them in terms of their susceptibility to influenza or any other diseases," Weese said.</p>
<p>The veterinarian who treated the cat in Iowa, Dr. Brett Sponseller, said two of the three people in the home had flu-like symptoms before the feline became ill.</p>
<p>Weese said pet owners should take the same precautions against spreading swine flu to pets as they would with humans -- by avoiding close contact, especially face-to-face, and washing their hands frequently.</p>

<p>Re: 'Flu response plan fumbled' (Editorial, Nov. 5)</p>
<p>If the H1N1 issue is confusing, there is blame to be shared, and some of it lies with Auditor General Sheila Fraser. Her assertion that the Minister of Public Safety was responsible for pandemic planning was unhelpful, except to further fuel partisan grandstanding. There are no H1N1 border issues or problems in airports or public buildings. As long as the government is prepared for those developments, it matters not whether the plan is on standby or rubber-stamped. The government preferred the Ministry of Health to co-ordinate the plan, guided by experts in infectious disease and public health.</p>
<p>Local clinics were thrown off by the early delivery of vaccine, and they were stymied by droves of people who decided on vaccination after all. With escalating reports of infection and death, the summertime apathy following Internet messaging turned to panic.</p>
<p>The CBC and CTV have been told how the media, through "spin" and "lack of perspective," may have contributed to confusion and a sense of panic. On The National, public health officials offered a scathing assessment of media coverage, though Michael Bliss' remarks on The Agenda were more diplomatic.</p>
<p>It should be said that the efforts of the Minister of Health Leona Aglukkaq have gone unreported. H1N1 information has been available on the Health Canada website from the start, and everyone received mail information. Co-ordination with provincial health ministries has been ongoing. The minister and the government have worked tirelessly on the first national vaccination campaign. Imperfect yes, but the antigovernment rhetoric is unwarranted.</p>

</p>
<p>It is disgraceful and scandalous that at least three professional sports teams in Canada and the boards of several Toronto hospitals were provided with H1N1 flu vaccine in advance of the general public.</p>
<p>With Halton closing its H1N1 clinics because of a vaccine shortage and Hamilton down to a day's supply, this is not just poor optics.</p>
<p>This is the worst kind of line-jumping elitism, reminiscent of the Cold War debates about who was important enough to warrant a spot in a bomb shelter -- or medieval lords barricading the castle gates while plague runs through the peasants' huts below.</p>
<p>All the excuses given so far for this sanctioned line jumping are stretching it at best and pure bullfeathers at worst.</p>
<p>Sure, athletes travel and sure their immune systems might be mildly weakened at peak-performance times. But most of them are among the fittest individuals in society. The truth of the matter is more likely that team owners didn't want a locker-room flu outbreak to set back their team's chances. Is the flu virus running through a change room somehow worse than it running through the shop floor of a factory or the cubicles in an office tower?</p>
<p>(This is not to include athletes or anyone else who are in the priority group because of asthma or other legitimate medical conditions. They have as much right to vaccination as anyone else.)</p>
<p>As for classifying hospital board members as medical workers, that's duplicitous nonsense. And, if the hospital locations are the health issue, boards can meet off-site.</p>
<p>Some of those involved in providing or allowing the vaccinations say they didn't know the vaccine was going to be in short supply. That's weak. Shortage or not, everyone knew from the beginning the vaccine was being rolled out, as available, according to need.</p>
<p>That's the only way a vaccine should be apportioned -- by need, not who you know.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of just inconveniencing the hoi polloi. This is a matter of public safety -- of most effectively rationing a limited initial supply of vaccine. In some fundamental issue of principle, this is worse than misusing public money for spas and luxury meals. This is about using power or position to push ahead, in a health crisis, of people with genuine need. How dare they?</p>
<p>Ontario Health Minister Deb Matthews needs to make it clear -- in the strongest possible language or through the strongest possible actions -- that jumping the line for publicly provided vaccine will not be tolerated. Government needs to make it clear: A pro athlete or a hospital governor is not more valuable to society than someone who struggles on minimum wage to feed her or his family.</p>
<p>Anyone on the public payroll or in a position of public trust who by virtue of their job jumped the line for H1N1 vaccination should be ashamed. Precisely this sort of thing is what breeds public cynicism, distrust and contempt for those in positions of responsibility.</p>
<p>John Lennon said it well (albeit in another context): "Ah, how do you sleep? / Ah, how do you sleep at night?"</p>

<p>The recession's lingering effects will drag profits down more than 20 per cent this year across most of the six Canadian industries covered by the Conference Board of Canada's industrial profile, the Ottawa-based think-tank said Monday.</p>
<p>"All industries are grappling with the effects of reduced demand and downward pressure on prices as a result of the recession," said Michael Burt, associate director of industrial economic trends.</p>
<p>"The end result is reduced sales and profitability in nearly every industry covered in these reports, with the transportation and wholesale trade industries being the most affected. On the upside, the recession has lowered input prices and limited wage growth, reducing cost pressures."</p>
<p>Highlights of the report include:</p>
<p>-Transportation and warehousing, hurt by lower travel demand, diminishing global trade and manufacturing production, will experience a 29-per-cent drop in profits to $5.2 billion from $7.3 billion, the board forecast.</p>
<p>-Wholesale trade profits will fall to $11.2 billion from$14.5 billion as a result of difficult times in auto production and manufacturing, which gains in such areas as food, apparel and pharmaceuticals failed to offset.</p>
<p>-Retail trade profits will fall by 32 per cent to $8.6 billion in 2009 from $12.6 billion in 2008 due to weak customer demand and price cuts.</p>
<p>-Food services found full-service restaurants bearing the brunt of the recession while lower-cost establishments held up well. Earnings will fall 32 per cent to $826 million in 2009 from$1.2 billion the year before.</p>
<p>Accommodation will fall eight per cent in 2009 to just below$500 million following a 25-per-cent drop in 2008. A rising Canadian dollar resulted in a sharp decline in U.S. and foreign travellers.</p>
<p>-Food and beverage manufacturing has been largely recession proof, the board said, with the industry producing profits of$3.3 billion in 2008 and expected to earn$3.4 billion in 2009. Domestic food demand remained steady and exports grew.</p>
<p>The board was optimistic that transportation, and wholesale and retail trade would post profit growth once the recession fades, but said the accommodation sector could face a shaky recovery, "as the experience with SARS shows that an H1N1 outbreak could put additional pressure on the industry."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>MacIntyre placed on waivers</b>
</div><div>Jim Matheson   </div>

</p>
<p>Steve MacIntyre, whose idea of a good meal is a knuckle sandwich, won't be digging in with the Edmonton Oilers any longer.</p>
<p>MacIntyre was put on waivers on Monday. If he clears, he'll go to the Oilers' American Hockey League farm team at Springfield.</p>
<p>If another team wants a legitimate heavyweight, he'll move on to do the dirty job for that NHL club.</p>
<p>There's a possibility that Mac-Intyre, who was claimed by the Oilers from Florida during the 2008 training camp, might wind up back with the Panthers. They don't have a real bodyguard.</p>
<p>The Carolina Hurricanes and Tampa Bay Lightning are other teams which could use a watchman.</p>
<p>The teams in the Northwest Division who see MacIntyre the most have their tough guys -- Brian McGrattan in Calgary, Derek Boogaard in Minnesota, David Koci in Colorado and Darcy Hordichuk in Vancouver.</p>
<p>"That's the way the cookie crumbles," said the disappointed MacIntyre, before flying back to Edmonton to see if he's going to the minors or gets an NHL change of address.</p>
<p>Oilers coach Pat Quinn hardly used MacIntyre, playing him in four games. In three of those games, he barely got a minute or a shade more of ice-time-- 51 seconds vs. the Calgary Flames on Oct. 22, 79 seconds vs. the Detroit Red Wings on Oct. 29, and 84 seconds vs. the New York Rangers last Thursday.</p>
<p>The most work he had was 2:44 against the Columbus Blue Jackets because Quinn likes to roll four lines and didn't feel MacIntyre could play a regular shift, although he was keenly aware that the big guy worked very hard in practices to make himself into a better player.</p>
<p>Quinn felt MacIntyre took himself out of a few games with early penalties, like a hooking call against the Rangers two minutes into the game, and his battle-royal fight with McGrattan in the first five minutes.</p>
<p>Quinn thinks Zack Stortini, who led the NHL in fights last year, with 25, can handle the heavy lifting, along with fellow winger J.F. Jacques when he gets his sore back straightened away.</p>
<p>"It's his call," said the popular MacIntyre.</p>
<p>NILSSON MAY HAVE CONCUSSION</p>
<p>Winger Robert Nilsson, who has had a tough time winning over Quinn with his turnovers, got clobbered by defenceman Adam Foote in Sunday's game with the Colorado Avalanche.</p>
<p>He was experiencing some concussion-like symptoms when the plane landed in Ottawa on Monday. He didn't do well enough on the medical testing, after feeling nauseous.</p>
<p>Nilsson, who played six shifts in the first period, then five in the second and four in the third on a second line against the Avs, is iffy for tonight against Ottawa.</p>
<p>CHORNEY USES HIS HEAD</p>
<p>Oilers rookie defenceman Taylor Chorney escaped a serious injury when he took a puck in the helmet ear-hole in Sunday's game, but he might not play tonight because he hurt his ankle when he fell over an Avalanche player during a scramble just before David Jones's third-period goal.</p>
<p>Chorney threw his face in front of Kyle Cumiskey's shot and took the slapper on the side of his head.</p>
<p>"He came back and said 'I keep hearing this ringing,' '' said Oilers equipment manager Barrie Stafford. "He's a gutsy kid, but when he came to the bench I told him, 'Don't leave your feet,' '' said Quinn. "He laid down(to block the shot) backwards. He should be putting other extremities in the way of the shot."</p>
<p>OILERS MAY BE SHORT A FORWARD</p>
<p>Ales Hemsky (shoulder) remains in Edmonton. There is no indication when he may rejoin the team.</p>
<p>If Nilsson can't go, the Oilers only have 11 forwards, although Jason Strudwick could move to the wing.</p>
<p>Jacques (injury reserve, back) won't play. Same for Shawn Horcoff (shoulder).</p>
<p>GILBERT'S GOAL PROVIDES RELIEF</p>
<p>Defenceman Tom Gilbert almost forgot how to lift his arms in the air to celebrate a goal after blowing one past Colorado goalie Craig Anderson during the first period in Denver.</p>
<p>It was his first goal of the season. "Relief," said Gilbert, who last scored in the season finale last season at Calgary. "I didn't even see it go in, because of all those bodies in front of the net."</p>
<p>CALL-UPS PLAY A SIMPLE GAME</p>
<p>Quinn got a kick out of the play of call-ups Ryan Potulny and Liam Reddox in the win over the Avalanche because they play a simple game. They didn't have a lot of giveways.</p>
<p>"They're honest, pay attention to detail. Maybe they don't have the supposed skill level of others, but they bring the intangible side to the game that is as important as skill to coaches around the league," said Quinn.</p>
<p>SMID HAS TROUBLE BREATHING</p>
<p>Defenceman Ladislav Smid has had a tough last few days getting over his flu.</p>
<p>"Bad, bad chest pains. It's been hard breathing," said Smid, who was diagnosed with H1N1 a couple of weeks ago but played through it only to be felled by the other flu late last week.</p>
<p>"I kind of had it before, but not like now."</p>

<p>A memorial service will be held Friday for director Tim Ryan in a theatre he knew well: the John L. Haar at Grant MacEwan University's Jasper Place campus.</p>
<p>Ryan, a teacher, mentor, director, artistic director and the founding head of Grant Mac's theatre arts program, died last Thursday at 62 of congestive heart failure complicated by the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The memorial will include slides, shared memories and music, since Ryan knew everything there is to know about musical theatre.</p>
<p>It will take place from 4 to 7 p.m. Friday. The Jasper Place campus is at 10045 156th St.</p>

<p>- The best decision the Tories made for Albertans was to stick with Ed Stelmach. I can't stop grinning. - Of course Premier Stelmach received the majority of votes at the PC leadership review. Who else in their right mind would want to take responsibility for that mess? - That was quite a lofty cheque of support Alberta Conservatives gave Stelmach. Unfortunately, Ed will eventually have to turn to the public to cash it. - The tree that is flexible bends with the wind. The Alberta Conservatives survived for 40 years because they were flexible and could adapt to change. The premier should remember the tree that is rigid will break. - I'll bet the morning after the PC leadership convention a few years back, delegates woke up feeling like they would after a crazy Vegas weekend. They realized they had just married someone they didn't even know and were now stuck with them. - Stelmach should hire Paula Simons as an official adviser--and then he should listen to her.</p>
<p> She is often the only one who seems to have her head screwed on straight. - My pregnant wife was given her flu shot after a three-hour wait. The fact she was wearing a Calgary Flames jersey didn't seem to help. - The province should have held the H1N1 vaccine clinics at Commonwealth Stadium. It's the one place where there were enough seats for everyone waiting in line. - Quitting the war in Afghanistan would pay for public health care. - General Jonathan Vance demands the Afghans show honesty, integrity and good performance from all levels of government or our troops will leave. I guess the army will be pulling out of Canada any time now. - I've never understood the concept of the gun registry. If I had a gun with the possible intention of committing a crime with it, I sure wouldn't tell the government I had it. - John Crosbie can wear a sealskin coat as long as the honour guard at Buckingham Palace wears the skins of black bears on their heads. - The Journal must be kidding by listing magpies as one of the 52 reasons to love Edmonton. If these disgusting, noisy birds are among the best we can do, this city is in a lot of trouble. - Todd Babiak is an absolute hoot. I look forward to his weekly column from France. - With all due respect to the operators of the pawnshops and porn stores along Stony Plain Road who are protesting the LRT, the major redevelopment that will accompany rapid transit is a chance to make this street the showcase it should be instead of the embarrassment it is. - The welcome signs at the entrances to Edmonton reek of the late 1970s. Check out the new ones erected by the University of Alberta. Now they're cool. - A man who wins five major lottery prizes in five years says he was "tortured for all these months," waiting to be given his latest prize. How does this anguish compare with that of a family losing a hockey-playing son to H1N1, or a family waiting for more than a year to hear from their journalist daughter being held in captivity? - I didn't get a raise this year. My husband didn't get a raise this year and has already been told he won't get one next year, either. What makes public employees anymore deserving? - Don't believe all the nonsense about climate change. What's really causing global warming are women like me going through menopause. - Where can I buy shares in the company that manufactures road construction signs?</p>

</p>
<p>Victoria Times-Colonist</p>
<p>Police in B.C. are investigating a possible attempt to auction H1N1 vaccine on the Internet.</p>
<p>The ad was posted Monday morning by someone claiming to be a registered nurse auctioning off swine flu vaccine. It was pulled a few hours later.</p>
<p>"Hello, I am a nurse with an extra vial of the H1N1 vaccine. One vial will do 10 shots. I am willing to administer these shots to the highest bidder," stated the ad.</p>
<p>A national shortage of the vaccine has resulted in long lineups, with priority given to pregnant women and young children.</p>
<p>The ad said the auction would continue until midnight on Friday. After that, the nurse was to contact the highest bidder, come to the winner's home with proof of credentials and administer the shots.</p>
<p>"Good Luck," the ad concluded. Attempts to reach the poster were</p>
<p>unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Suzanne Germaine, spokeswoman for the Vancouver Island Health Authority, said there is no legal way of obtaining the H1N1 vaccine in B.C.--so any vial posted for sale is likely stolen.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Dark-horse days gone for Gushue</b>
</div><div>Allen Cameron   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>628 words</div><div>10 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>F2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>F our years ago, Brad Gushue was just part of the pack, a lightly regarded entrant in that year's Canadian Olympic curling trials whom rival skip Jeff Stoughton described as having "no chance" at the event.</p>
<p>We all know what happened; a win in Halifax in 2005 was followed two months later with an Olympic gold medal.</p>
<p>Fast forward to Tuesday, when Gushue and his St. John's, Nfld., foursome</p>
<p>(third Mark Nichols, second Ryan Fry, lead Jamie Korab) open play at the Trials pre-qualifier at the CN Centre in Prince George, where the final four men's and women's entrants will be decided for the <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> Olympic Trials next month in Edmonton.</p>
<p>You might think Gushue would like to fly under the radar like he did in Halifax. But you'd be wrong.</p>
<p>"The fact that people expect something from us now means that we're probably a better team than we were four years ago," said Gushue, the No. 3 seed in the 12-team triple-knockout tournament. "I'd rather go into an event a heavy favourite because you</p>
<p>know that people think you're the best team, and you probably are. I'd rather be in Glenn Howard's or Kevin Martin's shoes, mainly because they've already qualified (for the Trials)."</p>
<p>Instead, he's slogging it out in Prince George with 11 other strong entries, hoping to make the eight-team field in Edmonton, where they'll join Howard, from Coldwater, Ont., and three Edmonton entries, skipped by Martin, Randy Ferbey and Kevin Koe.</p>
<p>"I don't feel much pressure, to be honest," said Gushue, who onSaturdaytouredtheOlympic Athletes Village in Vancouver with Prince Charles. "I think the pressure is going to be on guys like Howard and Martin, really, who've been the top two teams the last couple years. I think our performance has been a little inconsistent and therefore I don't think we're going to be favoured. Other than the fact we're defending Olympic champions, that's the only reason the spotlight will be on us."</p>
<p>For the record, Stoughton, the top seed in Prince George (based on Canadian Team Ranking System standings), and the runner-up to Gushue in the '05 Trials, freely and laughingly, said, "Of COURSE (Gushue) has a chance."</p>
<p>In fact, said Stoughton, there are no lightweights in the Prince George field, which includes other heavyweights such as No. 2 seed and former worldchampWayneMiddaugh of Victoria Harbour, Ont., and No. 4 seed Mike McEwen of Winnipeg, along with No. 5 Kerry Burtnyk of Winnipeg and red-hot No. 9 Bob Ursel of Kelowna, B.C.</p>
<p>"You know what? It's a very good field; some teams have had success this year and some teams have rebounded from off years last year and some teams you never know what you're going to get," said Stoughton. "It's got everything, and it's our focus that we've got to be pretty darn good next weekend or we're not playing, basically, until February. December will be a long month for the teams that don't make it."</p>
<p>The women's event features former world champ Kelly Scott of Kelowna as the top seed, and coming off a strong fall cashspiel season; the top four seeds are rounded out by No. 2 Sherry Middaugh of Ontario, No. 3 Marie-France Larouche of Quebec City and Regina's Michelle Englot.</p>
<p>Already qualified for the Trials are Calgary's Shannon Kleibrink and Cheryl Bernard, reigning Canadian champ Jennifer Jones of Winnipeg and Stefanie Lawton of Saskatoon.</p>

</p>
<p>A lavish dinner of lobster bisque, shrimp and beef tenderloin, or a humble serving of veggies, rice and lentils?</p>
<p>Diners won't know which meal they'll get on Thursday at Rich Man, Poor Man, a fund-raiser organized by University of Calgary medical students to raise money for a student-run medical clinic at the Calgary Drop-In & Rehab Centre.</p>
<p>"At each table of eight, one random person gets the rich man dinner and the rest of the table gets the poor man meal," said student Christine O'Reilly.</p>
<p>"I've seen the concept done in other cities, and it's interesting because the 'rich man' ends up feeling kind of guilty and doesn't enjoy the meal as much as you'd think because everyone's staring at them."</p>
<p>O'Reilly hopes the event will raise awareness about the widening gap between rich and poor--and about $10,000 for a student-run clinic that she says will provide valuable experience for students, help a population that often has difficulty accessing medical services and save the health-care system money.</p>
<p>Second-year medical student Jori Hardin was inspired to start the clinic when she took an ethics course from Dr. Janette Hurley, a clinical lecturer in the U of C's department of family medicine. As the drop-in centre's resident physician, she runs a clinic for the homeless there two days a week.</p>
<p>"I think it's phenomenal how Dr. Hurley has dedicated her life to helping the underserved," said Hardin. "I asked her if there were any students working with her and she said no. That's where we started."</p>
<p>About 20 medical students are championing the clinic, she said, with another 200 willing to volunteer once it's up and running.</p>
<p>Hardin said the plan is to launch a pilot project at the drop-in centre with Hurley acting as a preceptor, providing practical experience and training to four students who would see patients and provide care such as suturing and cleaning wounds.</p>
<p>"It's like any teaching institution: the student presents, the preceptor reviews and we create a plan for the patient based on that," said Hurley, who added that free, student-run medical clinics are common in the United States, but less so in Canada.</p>
<p>The pilot was to start two weeks ago. However, it's been postponed until January due to the H1N1 flu epidemic, said Hardin. If it goes well, the goal is to expand on Hurley's two clinics with an additional weekly clinic overseen by other volunteer doctor/preceptors from the community.</p>
<p>"Our long-term dream is to have it running on evenings and weekends in a free-standing clinic outside the drop-in centre," said Hardin.</p>
<p>"I'm excited to see students taking this initiative," said Dr. Tom Feasby, dean of the U of C's faculty of medicine. Although there is no formal credit given for their involvement in the student-run medical clinic, he said the students will learn a lot.</p>
<p>"It promotes goodwill and camaraderie and it fits with the school's increasing emphasis on social accountability," he said.</p>
<p>Funds raised on Thursday will go toward buying medical supplies such as bandages and wound cleaning kits, as well as warm socks and blankets for the homeless, said O'Reilly.</p>

<p>Re: "Auditor considers H1N1 review; 'What can be learned' from lineups?: Dunn," Nov. 5.</p>
<p>The original rollout has been, at best, ludicrous and, at worst, criminal. I say this because the clinic openings were advertised as open to the general public without any restrictions.</p>
<p>The mobs that were flocking to these sites were awful. I really felt for the front-line staff who were being subjected to the crowds of less-than happy patrons.</p>
<p>I don't care who was waiting, six hours in a line will make even the happiest person somewhat disgruntled.</p>
<p>This entire dog-and-pony show is so indicative of how government works in this province. There were repeated warnings about the pandemic, yet only four clinics opened in a city of more than one million people. Then a fifth opened that was restricted to children, pregnant women and the elderly and then all of the clinics were closed. They reopened again, all of them with eligibility requirements that should have been implemented from the beginning.</p>
<p>Too bad my Mom was wrong when she taught me that I am responsible for my own actions.</p>
<p>If I make a mistake, I take ownership, apologize and never do it again. I guess that integrity is a liability in the world today.</p>

<p>They shouldn't matter. Byelections never do.</p>
<p>But try telling that to a government anxiously awaiting the only voter validation of 2009 for its deficit-financed, big-cheque programs as it road-tests the Conservative machine for a serious run for a majority government next year.</p>
<p>If there's been a harder push by a governing party to buy a seat or two that doesn't mean very much in the greater scheme of things for Prime Minister Stephen Harper, it has escaped my fragile memory.</p>
<p>Highway improvements for eastern Quebec, a missing-in-spawn salmon inquiry for B.C. and plenty of oversized Conservative cheque handouts backed by visiting Senate stars and radio commercials by cabinet ministers in Nova Scotia--all in the pursuit of what senior government officials declared to be a four-way lost cause long before the polls closed.</p>
<p>Measured against those low expectations and clearly helped by the hefty price of all that pure porky government payola, the Conservatives won huge in the byelection blitz last night.</p>
<p>At the risk of rewriting the baseball definition, they scored a two-run grand slammer of a night.</p>
<p>The Conservatives didn't expect to win either of the two Bloc Quebecois seats, so to overcome a 16-point deficit from the 2008 campaign to emerge in this New Brunswick border riding as the winner is a stunning victory. (The other Bloc seat in Montreal was never in serious play for a colour change.)</p>
<p>Even after they gagged and closeted their candidate, the Conservatives showed well in a B.C. riding defended by a strong New Democrat for the incumbent party.</p>
<p>At best, the Conservatives had aimed to reclaim the Nova Scotia seat they lost to kicked-out independent Bill Casey--and they did it in a convincing romp over a popular New Democrat who had the incumbent NDP premier's blessing.</p>
<p>The New Democratic Party aimed to shore up their shaky federalist credentials in Quebec and they did succeed in bouncing the Liberals out of second place to the BQ in the Montreal contest.</p>
<p>And while it would be unfair to call this a damning referendum on Michael Ignatieff's troubled Liberal leadership given his party was not a contender for any of these seats, the results did nothing to inspire confidence in his party's resiliency or ability to rebound.</p>
<p>Of course, the beauty of these byelections was having the only electoral finger-wrestling of the year contested in non-Conservative ridings with wide demographic, issue and geographical diversity. It gave the Big Blue Conservative machine the perfect come-from-behind practice field for the real deal next year.</p>
<p>The public's take on stimulus spending as a recession vaccine was also on trial here. Could voters be bought with their own money or, more precisely, the deficit dollars borrowed from their children? The answer seems to be: "You betcha."</p>
<p>OK, so it would be a shameless exaggeration to suggest Monday night's voting does anything more than underline the momentum tilt of the moment, all subject to change without notice.</p>
<p>But these results will certainly send the re-energized Conservatives off for a holly, jolly Christmas season.</p>
<p>In the weeks to come, their leader will tour China and India looking prime ministerial. Prime Minister Harper's MPs will bask in mounting pre-Olympic excitement while handing out ever-bigger cheques for the next construction season to come.</p>
<p>And if H1N1 passes without major pandemic-casualty mayhem, this government will have emerged from the fall sitting with barely a scratch on its record.</p>
<p>If nothing else, the byelections have shown those tens of billions in borrowed spending have successfully stimulated Conservative fortunes during an economic downturn. Given that the impact of all this deficit squandering has yet to manifest as a sustained recovery, that may have been the real Conservative goal all along.</p>

</p>
<p>Five more Albertans with H1N1 influenza--including a Calgarian--died over the weekend as emergency departments across the province are reporting volumes 20 per cent greater than this time last year.</p>
<p>The latest deaths, which bring the number of Alberta H1N1 fatalities to 25, included two people in their 20s, two middle-aged individuals and one senior.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>calgaryherald.com</p>
<p>Go online for breaking news and our special section on the H1N1 flu outbreak</p>
<p>All the victims had health conditions that predisposed them to developing serious disease from swine flu.</p>
<p>"We did, tragically, have five more deaths over the weekend," said Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health with Alberta's medical superboard. "(That's) not unexpected at this stage of the outbreak."</p>
<p>One of the victims was from Calgary, two were from Edmonton and two were from southern Alberta.</p>
<p>The deaths come as officials say the virus is continuing to place pressure on the province's health system, with a total of 546 people hospitalized since the swine flu outbreak began in the spring.</p>
<p>An estimated one-third of patients in intensive care are infected with H1N1, although Predy said critical care wards are coping with the volumes at this point.</p>
<p>In Calgary, Alberta Health Services is encouraging people to visit the Richmond Road influenza assessment centre if they have mild or moderate flu symptoms, noting emergency ward volumes have skyrocketed.</p>
<p>"We can safely say we're seeing at least a 20 per cent increase in volumes at the emergency departments provincewide, over this time last year," said Don Stewart, a spokesman with the superboard.</p>
<p>The local assessment centre is seeing between 200 and 300 people a day but has minimal wait times, said Stewart.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alberta's influenza vaccination clinics, which have inoculated an estimated 450,000 people, are opening their doors to two new risk groups--in addition to young children and pregnant women.</p>
<p>Beginning today, Calgary's six clinics will also open to parents of infants under six months of age (or one parent and one caregiver), in an attempt to protect newborns who can't be vaccinated.</p>
<p>The clinics will also offer shots to children under age 10 with health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity and cancer.</p>
<p>While the clinics were initially criticized for multi-hour waits when Alberta first launched its program, the Calgary sites were slow over the weekend and on Monday.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>Flu Clinic Changes</p>
<p>Beginning today, two new high-risk groups are eligible for vaccinations: - Both parents (or one parent and one caregiver) of infants under six months of age. Proof of the infant's age must be provided. Caregivers attending clinics alone will need photo ID and a letter from the parent or guardian confirming their role. - Children with chronic health conditions who are under 10 as of Nov. 1 are also eligible for a shot. Proof of age is required. If applicable, health officials are asking for a prescription or other documentation of the child's condition. Eligible conditions include diabetes, obesity, cancer, chronic kidney disease, asthma requiring medication, lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome and chronic liver disease. Several other conditions are also eligible. For a full list visit www.albertahealthservices.ca[http://www.albertahealthservices.ca]</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Conspiracy-theory fringe sees message in V; But don't look for a political agenda in this spaceship show, producer says</b>
</div><div>Alex Strachan   </div>

</p>
<p>It's obvious, isn't it?</p>
<p>A benevolent overlord descends from the heavens and promises peace, goodwill, eternal happiness, a cure for H1N1 flu and a health care plan for everyone.</p>
<p>Trouble is, the benevolent face of peace masks darker, malevolent forces at work. The lizard people in the sudden-hit miniseries V -- more than two million viewers in Canada for last week's premiere; another 14 million in the U.S. -- want to take over the world, any way they can.</p>
<p>Some on the alien-conspiracy wing of the political lunatic fringe are already reading real-world messages into V's tale of spaceships and sexy space aliens, as personified -- embodied, if you will -- by Anna, played with a wry nudge-and-a-wink by Brazilian-born actress Morena Baccarin.</p>
<p>Anna and her kind, the theory goes, are a metaphor for President Barack Obama and his inner circle of toadies, Rahm Emanuel, Robert Gibbs and David Axelrod, who, as we all know, are actually lizard people in disguise, bent on forcing their neo-socialist agenda on the world. We know this, because a certain U.S. cable-news network, known for its fairness and balance, says so.</p>
<p>Never mind that V is supposed to be fiction. It's about a heroic TV journalist; how could it not be fiction?</p>
<p>Scratch beneath the surface, however, and that may be reptilian blood you draw.</p>
<p>V is a thinly disguised warning about the Obama administration, right?</p>
<p>"Look, there are always going to be people who will look for agendas in everything," V producer Jeffrey Bell said this past summer, when broached with the subject.</p>
<p>"This show was conceived during the Bush administration. It was made during an Obama administration. There are people on either side who will find things. You can say, 'Look how stupid these people are for following blindly and believing everything the government is saying.' Then there are others who will say, 'Look at these people who are promising everything with no price; they are leading them to their own doom.' We want to get people to show up and watch V and talk about it. But to tie it to the Birthers or anything is kind of, you know, ridiculous."</p>
<p>Deniability is plausibility, right?</p>
<p>"You're not listening to me!"</p>
<p>Seriously, though, V packs a powerful punch, message-wise. Is that not true?</p>
<p>"Look, how this works politically is fun for people to talk about, but all we're trying to do is tell really exciting, entertaining, emotional stories.</p>
<p>"Seriously, there is a wish-fulfillment element to it. If [all their promises] came true, you would be really excited, wouldn't you? And then, if it turned out that you were one of the two or three people who knew more than anybody else, you might seem crazy."</p>
<p>If V is about anything other than spaceships and outer-space aliens making outlandish promises, V creator Scott Peters added, it's blind faith.</p>
<p>"When we originally conceived the show, I opened up and broadened the theme to be about blind devotion," Peters explained. "What happens when you don't ask questions about the things you believe in? I think that can be applied across the board, whether you're talking about a political issue or a religious issue or a relationship issue."</p>
<p>No one in V has yet to say, 'Take me to your leader.' That may come later.</p>
<p>Colour Photo: Appearances are deceiving in V, a new series
about the world's first alien encounter. With huge spaceships
simultaneously appearing over 29 cities around the world, the
Visitors (or Vs) seem to promote a message of peace.

<div id="hd"><b>Country is battling another enemy -- the H1N1 flu pandemic; Government declares state of emergency and closes schools, wedding halls and even public bathrooms</b>
</div><div>Jay Price   </div>
<div>McClatchy Newspapers</div>
<div>791 words</div><div>10 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>As if the Taliban, car bombs, roadside bombs, leftover Soviet landmines, political unrest and errant NATO air attacks weren't enough, Afghans are facing a new killer: the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>The government has declared a state of emergency and closed schools, universities and even wedding halls and public bathrooms for three weeks to slow the spread of the virus, which has killed 10 people in the capital in less than two weeks. Cases are popping up in provinces spanning the country, with new outbreaks reported in two more provinces on Saturday.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that we have an epidemic in our country now, and we are moving into the fall season when the conditions make it more likely to spread," said Ahmad Farid Raaid, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health.</p>
<p>In the past few days, surgical face masks have bloomed like poppies on the faces of worried pedestrians along crowded streets and markets of the capital as more cases were reported.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of such masks in preventing a wearer from contracting flu is uncertain, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but they are selling quickly in Kabul. Many vendors are boys who would be in school, except for the emergency closing.</p>
<p>"I would prefer to be in class, but I can sell these for 10 afghanis (about 20 cents)," said Hafzuillah, 12, waving a fistful of masks as he stood among money-changers and carts of roasted pine nuts in the chaotic human tide of Kabul's open-air central market. Like many Afghans, he uses just a single name.</p>
<p>In the past few days, the government has ramped up its response to the epidemic, Raaid said. Most of the 456 cases among Afghans -- and all the fatalities -- have occurred in Kabul. On Friday, his ministry distributed flu medicine and 10 tons of related medical supplies to 34 hospitals and clinics in the capital.</p>
<p>The Afghan government has enough anti-viral medicine to treat about 50,000 flu patients, with another 30,000 doses on the way, Raaid said. But there is no H1N1 vaccine on hand, although the government expects to receive 550,000 doses through the World Health Organization and is asking for 11 million doses of vaccine.</p>
<p>The initial round of vaccinations will go to a prioritized list of people, starting with health care workers, then pregnant women, young children, the national army and police, then students.</p>
<p>Since August, the health ministry has been running a public awareness campaign aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, Raaid said, but last week, it ratcheted up the effort, signing contracts with several TV and radio stations for about $200,000 in additional ads.</p>
<p>Signs in government buildings urge workers not to shake hands, to wash their hands often with soap and to uses masks. Posters bearing similar messages have been places in public locations around the city.</p>
<p>Even as the health ministry spreads information about prevention and treatment, though, it's having to fighting rumours that undercut the effort. A common one, because of what some regard as the suspicious timing of the emergency declaration, is that the government is exaggerating the danger to discourage gatherings to protest the outcome of the presidential election, which left incumbent Hamid Karzai in place despite massive election fraud in his favour. The runoff that had been scheduled for Saturday was called off after his main rival, Abdullah Abdullah, pulled out and Abdullah's supporters remain angry.</p>
<p>Asked about that rumour while touring a Kabul clinic Saturday with journalists and an official of the UN's World Health Organization, Afghan Health Minister Amin Fatemie said there was absolutely no truth to it.</p>
<p>Raaid said the rapid spread of confirmed cases and the deaths mean the government had to take aggressive measures. The three-week shutdown was modelled after the way other countries have responded to the pandemic, he said.</p>
<p>Several other countries have shut down schools briefly to block the flu, among them neighbouring Iran, which recently closed its schools because of an outbreak similar to Afghanistan's.</p>
<p>"This was not a political decision; it's a pure technical decision," Raaid said.</p>
<p>Still, in Afghanistan, talk on the street can carry more weight than the official line.</p>
<p>Abdul Karim, 46, a moneychanger in Kabul's chaotic central market -- one of the busiest in the world and exactly the kind of place flu experts say to shun during an outbreak -- said that several of his friends stopped using masks when they heard the rumours.</p>

<p>Health Canada's advice, on protecting yourself from H1N1, is to stock up on pain and fever medication and "easy meals." No wonder people are sick. That is the worst advice possible.

<div id="hd"><b>B.C. study links acetominophen and asthma risk; Higher doses of the common pain reliever increase risk, Vancouver researchers find</b>
</div><div>Randy Shore   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>893 words</div><div>10 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>A new study led by scientists at the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute has confirmed that use of acetaminophen by children and adults is associated with the development of asthma and wheezing.</p>
<p>The review of 19 studies involving 425,000 subjects found that the risk of asthma increased by 60 per cent in those children given acetaminophen the year before. The risk of asthma in adults who used acetaminophen was 75 per cent higher than in those who did not use the common fever-reducing pain killer, best known by the brand name Tylenol.</p>
<p>The study hints that the asthma-acetaminophen link is more than chance.</p>
<p>In a cause-and-effect relationship, lower doses would be associated with decreased risk and higher doses with increased risk, explained co-author Mark FitzGerald, a professor of respiratory medicine at the University of British Columbia. "And we did find that effect."</p>
<p>The result does not necessarily mean that acetaminophen is a cause of asthma. "This is not the kind of study that can establish cause and effect," he cautioned.</p>
<p>It is also possible that people who get respiratory illnesses and fevers of the kind commonly treated with acetaminophen are more prone to develop asthma.</p>
<p>FitzGerald feels some urgency to explain the puzzling rise in asthma globally over the past two decades. Some argue that overly clean living environments are behind the rise, he said.</p>
<p>But about 20 years ago physicians started to avoid giving aspirin to children and began to recommend acetaminophen, FitzGerald said. "There was a change in practice and in the succeeding 20 years or so the prevalence of asthma has increased also."</p>
<p>The asthma-acetaminophen association is "consistent" throughout the 19 studies, said co-author Mahyar Etminan, an assistant professor of medicine at UBC and researcher at VCHRI's Centre for Clinical Epidemiology and Evaluation.</p>
<p>"Our review strengthens the notion that we really have to look into this question more carefully and more seriously," he said.</p>
<p>With the swine flu circulating, Etminan does not want to frighten people into abandoning acetaminophen as a way to control their child's fever.</p>
<p>One study comparing acetaminophen and ibuprofen showed that ibuprofen is not associated with a higher risk of asthma, but that drug has a much shorter track record for treating children and carries a theoretical risk of Reye's syndrome, which can cause liver and brain damage in children and is commonly associated with aspirin-like drugs, Etminan said.</p>
<p>"For adults, ibuprofen is probably the safer of the two in terms of asthma risk," he said. "For kids, pediatric guidelines still point to acetaminophen use -- at least until we have a more definitive study."</p>
<p>Etminan and FitzGerald were intrigued by a 2008 study published in the medical journal The Lancet that linked increased risk of asthma and use of acetaminophen.</p>
<p>FitzGerald, Etminan and their partners selected 19 studies that included a diagnosis of asthma and specifically defined acetaminophen intake.</p>
<p>"Most of the studies are observational, they are not as strong methodologically as a large, randomized clinical trial," said Etminan. The strongest kind of studies for proving causality involve giving some patients a drug and others a placebo, which presents ethical problems as some patients would receive no treatment for their symptoms during the study.</p>
<p>A study that followed two groups of people -- one that uses acetaminophen and another that uses ibuprofen -- over time could reveal whether acetaminophen is causing asthma, he said.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen has been widely used in North America for more than 60 years. Tylenol sales total more than $1 billion a year worldwide.</p>

<p>Re: "Jewish General inoculates its top 200 donors" (Gazette, Nov. 7).</p>
<p>Aaron Derfel's article highlights the delusional state of many normally-intelligent people when health care is concerned.</p>
<p>Volunteers and committee members give their time to attend those thrilling and exciting hospital-board meetings. They are present and exposed to the same H1N1 risks in a hospital as many physicians or other health-care workers. It is not out of line to vaccinate these individuals. It is as ethical or unethical as physicians bypassing the waiting room or waiting lists to access care or tests for family members. This is the way it is, unethical or ethical, depending where you are perched.</p>
<p>Physicians, their extended families and friends, volunteers, the wealthy, politicians, judges, and donors have been receiving care on a priority basis unrelated to medical need for years.</p>
<p>Not good, not bad, just the way it is. Kudos to the Jewish General Hospital for looking after all their employees and volunteers.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu clinics reliant on uncertain supply; 'There are a lot of unknowns,' medical officer of health says</b>

<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>827 words</div><div>10 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Uncertainty about how many doses of the H1N1 vaccine will be shipped to Ottawa over the next two weeks has forced the public-health department to consider temporarily closing vaccination clinics, just as officials are preparing to ramp up their immunization campaign.</p>
<p>With about 30,000 doses of the pandemic vaccine in hand, officials are expecting another shipment to arrive on Wednesday. But they have no idea how big the delivery will be, or whether it will consist mostly of a special version of the vaccine that is reserved for pregnant women.</p>
<p>As a result, the city's vaccine supply could run out before the week is over, forcing the clinics to shut down.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of unknowns," said Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's chief medical officer of health. "How much (of the vaccine) will come in? How quickly will it arrive? What will come in? We just don't know what's going to happen."</p>
<p>The situation hints at widespread confusion among the levels government, with municipal officials, who are ultimately responsible for getting the vaccine into people's arms, at the mercy of decisions being made by provincial and federal officials.</p>
<p>Last week, Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, warned that manufacturer GlaxoSmith-Kline had fallen behind because it was making an unadjuvanted vaccine, which does not contain an immune booster, for pregnant women.</p>
<p>Glaxo has since switched its one production line back to making the adjuvanted vaccine, aimed at the rest of Canadians, but it will take some time to increase production to the target of three million doses per week.</p>
<p>Levy said the lack of information from the federal and provincial governments about vaccine shipments makes it difficult for public-health units to plan ahead beyond a day or two.</p>
<p>The uncertainty comes as the city has increased its pool of available vaccinators. In addition to the 140 nurses and paramedics who staff the city-run vaccination clinics daily, 120 family physicians have signed on to give the vaccine to patients at their offices.</p>
<p>Levy said his department has received orders for 40,000 doses from physicians who have met the provincial criteria to administer the pandemic vaccine, but it will only be released when the city receives enough supply.</p>
<p>"Certainly, in terms of distributing the vaccine, we're ready to go," said Levy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, about 1,500 people with flu-like symptoms have sought medical help at Ottawa's six flu assessment centres since they opened last Wednesday.</p>
<p>Judy Brown, spokeswoman for a citywide committee of hospital pandemic planners, said the centres, aimed at taking some of the load off emergency rooms, have led to a slight drop in ER visits. Even so, The Ottawa Hospital's General campus has had a particularly "challenging" time managing the increased number of patients with flu-like illnesses, Brown said.</p>
<p>Levy continued to urge people who have coughs and fevers, are at high risk of developing flu-related complications, and who don't have family doctors to head to the flu assessment centres.</p>

<p>Vaccination Clinics</p>
<p>The city's flu-vaccination clinics are still only accepting people in priority groups -- those under 65 with chronic health conditions, children six months to five years, pregnant women and front-line health workers -- for shots.

</p>
<p>I've got a good life now I've moved on</p>
<p>So when you cross my mind</p>
<p>I try not to think about</p>
<p>What might have been</p>
<p>'Cause that was then</p>
<p>And we have taken different roads</p>
<p>We can't go back again</p>
<p>There's no use giving in</p>
<p>And there's no way to know</p>
<p>What might have been</p>
<p>What Might Have Been</p>
<p>By Little Texas</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Dustin Penner says the What Might Have Been lyrics neatly sum up his attitude about the trade to the Ottawa Senators that never happened.</p>
<p>If Dany Heatley had accepted the first trade Senators general manager Bryan Murray had arranged, Penner, Andrew Cogliano and Ladislav Smid would be wearing Senators colours today. Milan Michalek and Jonathan Cheechoo would still be in San Jose, a couple of players on the West Coast with limited interest to Senators fans.</p>
<p>For those who've somehow missed the Oilers' early season results, Penner has 10 goals and 11 assists and was seventh in NHL scoring before Monday's action. It has been a stunning turnaround for a player who scored 17 goals and 20 assists in 2008-09. According to those around the Oilers, Penner has emerged as a dominating power forward thanks,</p>
<p>in large part, to the arrival of coach Pat Quinn. There are even suggestions that Penner has gained the attention of</p>
<p>the Canadian Olympic team brains trust.</p>
<p>"It has been a good year for me, personally, so far," Penner understated following a practice at Scotiabank Place in preparation for tonight's game against the Senators. "There has obviously been a (coaching) change. And for the other two guys involved in the trade that didn't happen, I think it has been good, staying in the same place that they've been familiar with for the past two, three years, and there's not much else to say about it. It's kind of like the Little Texas song, What Might Have Been."</p>
<p>Penner's start certainly begs the question about what might have been if he ended up playing as a winger on a line with Jason Spezza.</p>
<p>Cogliano, who would have probably figured in as a third- line centre with the Senators, has three goals and four assists. Smid was playing top- four minutes on defence for the Oilers until he was sidelined with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"I wasn't looking to be traded, obviously, so I'm happy with the way things turned out," Cogliano said. "It was an unfortunate situation where my named leaked out, but I realize it's part of the business and it's too bad, but I've just forgotten about it and moved on."</p>
<p>It's funny how life works out. Certainly funny enough for Penner and Cogliano to laugh about. At a Halloween party a few weeks back, Penner dressed up as Santa Claus with "no trade" written on his back. Cogliano dressed up as Heatley, with "no trade" written on his back. Taken together, the costumes became Heatley's no trade claus(e). Get it?</p>
<p>"It was just meant to be fun," Penner said.</p>
<p>Of course, there are no guarantees that Penner would have lit it up with the Senators if he had arrived here in July, or that Cogliano and Smid would have adapted quickly to their new surroundings. Instead of that trio, what do the Senators have to show for the Heatley deal that did happen?</p>
<p>Michalek has come largely as advertised, and is an outstanding two-way winger who leads the team with seven goals. His speed and feistiness make him an outstanding penalty killer and he is an offensive threat in all situations. Gradually, Spezza and Michalek are getting more accustomed to each other, and are becoming a dangerous duo, if not nearly as dynamic as the Spezza-Heatley connection.</p>
<p>The other player in the deal, Cheechoo, has achieved little. He continues to work hard, but is spinning his wheels, still searching for his first goal after 14 games. Cheechoo's lack of speed is an issue because he can't</p>
<p>get to the scoring areas often enough to be a consistent threat. The longer he goes without finding the net, the more the criticism of the trade grows. At some point, coach Cory Clouston will have to consider taking him out of the lineup.</p>
<p>"Am I satisfied with it?" Clouston said Monday, when asked about Cheechoo's statistics. "I'm satisfied with his work ethic, his attitude, but no, not his numbers. I don't think anybody could be satisfied with his numbers, but that doesn't mean he's not working hard. That doesn't mean he's not trying.</p>
<p>"It means he has got to find a way to get on the scoreboard. He works hard. He has got a great attitude. It will come."</p>
<p>Still, it's hard not to wonder about what might have been.</p>

</p>
<p>What is striking about the swine flu epidemic -- and the reaction of the public, the government and the media -- is not the nature of the illness, the effectiveness of the vaccine or the preparedness of public health officials.</p>
<p>What is striking is our view of death today, which has resonance on the eve of Remembrance Day. Fundamentally, our view of dying isn't what it used be. In the 21st century, especially in the West, we won't really tolerate death anymore.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the epidemic isn't as deadly as feared. That isn't news. Relatively speaking, few people have died from swine flu at home or abroad.</p>
<p>Yet here we are, wringing hands, wiping brows, lining up.</p>
<p>Officials scold queue-jumpers, inviting much hissing and a peculiarly Canadian public shaming.</p>
<p>A teenaged boy dies, apparently healthy, and the anxiety goes viral. The lines get longer, the demands louder. Do something. Now.</p>
<p>Hysteria is the new influenza. It is moving faster than the epidemic itself. The government misread the crisis! It ordered the wrong vaccine! This is its Hurricane Katrina!</p>
<p>The CBC examines every element of the epidemic, ad nauseam, including whether the network itself has exaggerated the story. (Given that The National has gone soft, revamping its format and embracing service journalism, how could it overplay this?)</p>
<p>Of course people have died, as they do from illness every day, and that is a personal tragedy. But it isn't a public one, not yet, even if that is what we have made of this.</p>
<p>Everyone has played their part. The public, terrified about the illness, makes demands. The government, worried about the fallout, tries to meet them. The media covers the story and amplifies it. And so it goes.</p>
<p>But it all starts with the essential view in our society that human life is fragile and defensible. This wasn't always so. Two generations ago, life was much, much cheaper.</p>
<p>Death came early and often. People did not live as long (the life expectancy has risen sharply in the last century). It wasn't unusual to lose an infant to disease; it happened to Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Winston Churchill.</p>
<p>War meant slaughter, and who really cared? In the First World War, more than a million died in the Battle of the Somme in France. They dropped by the thousands. Undaunted, the generals kept ordering them into battle.</p>
<p>That is what happened to the Newfoundland Regiment at Beaumont Hamel. On July 1, 1916, it lost 90 per cent of its men. At roll call that evening, there was almost no one.</p>
<p>The Second World War did not have the same costly trench warfare, but there was still tolerance of high casualties. When the Americans advanced, island by island, in the South Pacific, they would lose hundreds of marines in a morning. The Japanese would lose more.</p>
<p>In Europe, the Allies were mowed down in the hedges of Normandy, in the Ardennes, in the Battle of the Bulge. Still, there were always more soldiers to send into the fight, especially from the United States. Relatively few of the 16 million Americans in uniform saw combat.</p>
<p>Canadians and Americans died, of course, but not in the numbers of other countries. Hitler sent four million German soldiers to their deaths. The Russians lost 20 million people, mostly civilians. The Japanese killed some 300,000 civilians at Nanking.</p>
<p>The farther back you go, the more we seem to tolerate death. When the North and South fought the Civil War, the United States had about 30 million people, a little less than Canada has now. Some 620,000 Americans died in uniform, about two per cent, more than died in all the American wars from the Revolution to Korea. In today's America, that would be six million. Do you think we would accept those casualties today?</p>
<p>In This Republic of Suffering, historian Drew Gilpin Faust describes the culture of death of the Civil War. As the war continued, America became a slaughterhouse.</p>
<p>By contrast, when Canadian soldiers began dying in Afghanistan in 2002, the prime minister attended the ceremony marking the return of their bodies to Canada. Flags were lowered on Parliament Hill. Mourning became us.</p>
<p>The military was never comfortable with this practice and eventually it was stopped. But the Governor General still attends the patriation ceremony at CFB Trenton, when she can, and combat deaths are still news in Canada.</p>
<p>We have mourned, as a nation, each of the deaths of our soldiers in Afghanistan, as we should. But one wonders: what if our casualties in Afghanistan were several times that, like the Americans in the Civil War? Or the Newfoundlanders at Beaumont Hamel?</p>
<p>What would we be prepared, as a people, to accept? Our tolerance for death is dying, with consequences we do not yet understand.</p>
<p>Andrew Cohen is president of The Historica-Dominion Institute. These views are his own.</p>

<p>Re: H1N1 making moral leadership hard, Nov. 9.</p>
<p>The H1N1 inoculation program has provided us with a priceless insight into how the Canadian medical system functions.</p>
<p>Sadly, the vaccination program speaks volumes about the lack of ethics and morals in some people in positions of trust. Friends, family, hockey players, administrators, family members and people with money come first.</p>
<p>Although disgusted by the betrayal of the public trust, I have to temper that anger with the knowledge that perhaps the overall benefit to society of their actions outweighs the risk they have put some people in. We have witnessed the stark reality of what a two-tier health care system looks like.</p>

<p>Stories Report on Business is following today :</p>
<p>Fight for Cossette may be over</p>
<p>Cossette Inc. has set a high bar for competing takeover bids. The advertising agency announced this morning it had agreed to be acquired by a U.S. investment firm, Mill Road Capital, for $7.87 a share, well above a hostile bid of $4.95 a share from a group of former Cossette executives put forward in the summer. That group, formed as Cosmos Capital, doesn't have deep-pocketed backing, from a group such as another advertising company, signalling the fight for the company may be over.

<p>U.S. unemployment to remain high</p>
<p>The U.S. economy may be finally growing again, but jobs will be slow in coming back, Federal Reserve officials say. Presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks in San Francisco and Atlanta say the rebound simply won't be sharp enough to make a significant dent in unemployment yet. The U.S. jobless rate now stands at 10.2 per cent and millions of Americans are without work. “With such a slow rebound, unemployment could well stay high for several years to come,” Janet Yellen of the San Francisco Fed said in a speech today. “In other words, our recovery is likely to feel like something well short of good times.” Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/weak-pickup-wont-spur-jobs-fed/article1357810/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/weak-pickup-wont-spur-jobs-fed/article1357810/])</p>
<p>Better signs from Britain's banks</p>
<p>Britain's two biggest banks may be signalling a key moment as the financial crisis abates. Results from the banks indicate that bad debts, which have slammed the global banking sector, may have peaked. HSBC Holdings PLC, the biggest bank in Europe, noted the first decline in bad U.S. consumer loans in three years. Barclays PLC posted a hefty profit and said it would resume paying dividends. HSBC and Barclays are not necessarily indicative of the entire sector in Britain – Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC and Lloyds Banking Group PLC suffered mightily during the crisis – but they do follow a global trend of better times in the industry. "The biggest jolt has now passed through the global economy," said HSBC chief Michael Geoghegan.

<p>Japan frets over potential downgrade</p>
<p>Japan's new government is scrambling to deal with a stunning increase in the country's debt. Fitch Ratings today warned Japan it's at risk of a ratings downgrade if it cannot stick to its targets. The International Monetary Fund, for example, projects Japan's debt will hit almost 230 per cent of gross domestic product by 2010 for the worst showing among the Group of Seven industrialized nations. Also this morning, fresh data showed Japan's trade surplus narrowed in September as imports rose 5.9 per cent and exports 2.5 per cent as global trade gathers steam again.

<p>Rona cites first signs of recovery</p>
<p>Canada's biggest home renovation retailer says it has seen the first signs of recovery in the industry. Rona Inc. said today its third-quarter profit fell to $49.1-million or 38 cents a share from $52.5-million or 45 cents as revenue dipped about 4 per cent to $1.3-billion. The company cited a drop in home construction, sagging consumer confidence and poor weather. Still, said chief executive Robert Dutton, "as anticipated, we glimpsed the first signs of recovery in our industry during the third quarter ? The business environment is increasingly favourable to real estate activity over all. Very low mortgage rates and the popularity of the renovation tax credits should continue to stimulate renovation activity across the country."</p>
<p>There's no business like show business, even in a recession</p>
<p>Canadians love a night out at the movies, particularly when times are tough. Yet again this morning, Cineplex Galaxy Income Fund posted strong third-quarter results, helped along by the likes of some dinosaurs and some basterds. And popcorn, of course. Cineplex profit jumped to $20.4-million in the third quarter from $18.4-million a year earlier and revenue rose to $257.5-million from $239.1-million. Box office revenue was its highest ever. Among its top movies in the quarter were Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince , Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs , District 9 and Inglourious Basterds .

<p>Airlines cite better travel demand</p>
<p>Two more air carriers – Singapore Airlines and Korean Air – are citing a pickup in travel demand. The world's airlines have been hit by everything from fuel prices to the recession to fears over the H1N1 flu. Last week, Air Canada and British Airways PLC signalled the industry may be reaching bottom. Today, Korean Air posted its second consecutive quarterly profit, and projected even better times next year. Singapore Airlines posted a narrower loss, and said demand is rebounding, though gradually.</p>
<p>Why break-ins are down in some U.S. cities</p>
<p>If there can be any silver lining in America's jobs crisis, it's this: With more people at home, break-ins are on the decline in some areas. The Associated Press reports that in Minneapolis, for example, burglaries were down more than 15 per cent in the first nine months of the year. In Boston, there have been 335 fewer break-ins. And in Aurora, just outside Chicago, home burglaries fell more than 15 per cent. That's not to suggest break-ins are down across the country. They are in fact rising in some cities. But it's worth noting that in Chicago, the rate of increase is slowing. And in some cities that were already reporting a decline, the drop is speeding up. "With a lot more unemployed people, a lot more people are staying home, and they see more in their neighbourhood," Sgt. Thomas Lasater of the St. Louis County, Mo., police department told the news agency. Some police also cite the decline in prices of metals like copper, which crooks had been stealing from vacant homes.</p>
<p>Madoff's lifestyle: Watches, furs, personalized jacket</p>
<p>The U.S. government is auctioning many of the personal belongings of Bernard and Ruth Madoff, including jewelry, furs and about 40 watches. The U.S. Marshals Services will auction about 200 items on the weekend, an attempt to raise at least $500,000 (U.S.) for Mr. Madoff's victims, the Wall Street Journal reports. Among the items cited by the newspaper: A blue satin Mets jacket with “Madoff” stitched on the back, three boogie boards, his-and-hers stationery, Rolexes, Audemars and Piguets, five fur coats, Tiffany placecard holders and three monogrammed polo shirts. The government is also auctioning Mr. Madoff's homes and boats separately.</p>
<p>Alan Greenspan: From ‘exuberance' to ‘re-liquefying'</p>
<p>The former central banker who coined the phrase "irrational exuberance" has a new one for the markets: "re-liquefying." In Edmonton yesterday, Alan Greenspan told a business audience that the rebound in stock prices is "re-liquefying" America's economy, Bloomberg News reports. The former Federal Reserve chairman, from 1987 until early 2006, also said there are signs that the housing market crash may be bottoming. "It may be too soon, but all the relevant price indexes are turning," he said. "Now whether or not that is temporary is very difficult to tell, because we have never been through anything like this."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 a fiscal blight</b>
</div><div>Iain Marlow    </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>

</p>
<p>To the Canadian economy's woes, add H1N1. The panic-inducing phenomenon will help erase 20 per cent of profits across six industries this year, a new report says.</p>
<p>The social impact of the virus, combined with the persistent sluggishness of the economy and a rising loonie, will hurt bottom lines in the year ahead, says the study released by the Conference Board of Canada and the <span class="companylink">Business Development Bank of Canada</span>.</p>
<p>It is keeping people from dining out - not only at fancy restaurants, but restaurants, period; it has led to international bans on Canadian pork; and it is resulting in fewer people travelling around the country to the detriment of hoteliers, says the Canadian Industrial Profile for Autumn 2009, released on Monday.</p>
<p>One of the obvious drop-offs will be international air travel to Canada, says Michael Burt, associate director of the organization's industrial trends group.</p>
<p>"The numbers, obviously, were already very weak at the beginning of the year, as a result of the global recession," Burt said.</p>
<p>"But if you look at the numbers starting in May, when it became public knowledge that H1N1 was in Canada, we saw even more precipitous declines in the number of visitors coming to Canada, particularly from Asian countries" such as China and Japan, he added.</p>
<p>The report noted that H1N1 could have "significant consequences" for the food services industry, if people are too spooked to eat out.</p>
<p>It also said that bans on Canadian pork imposed by Venezuela, Russia and China "limit the opportunities for export growth" in a sector already hit by the rising price of the Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>The board based its predictions in part on the economic fallout from SARS in 2003, when the pandemic clogged hospitals, necessitated quarantines, and induced widespread fear and paranoia.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 2003, Burt said, Canada's economy actually shrank because of the outbreak, something usually reserved for recessions, like the present one.</p>
<p>In the U.S., a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pegged the country's annual GDP loss from flu season at 0.7 per cent, including the cost of time taken off work and medical expenses.</p>
<p>But Burt said H1N1 would likely erode the GDP in Canada more than that, since even healthy, working-age adults can be knocked out of contributing to the economy.</p>
<p>Already, people are thinking twice about shaking hands in business encounters. Canadians' social apprehensions could get even worse, he said.</p>
<p>Companies such as <span class="companylink">Telus Corp</span>. have joined public health boards in advising any of their employees who come down with flu-like symptoms to stay home.</p>
<p>"It may not have reached a crisis point yet, in terms of people choosing not to meet in public or go to business meetings," Burt said. "But people are thinking about it."</p>

</p>
<p>Hospital board members who received the scarce H1N1 vaccine defended their position at the head of the queue Monday, even after the province's chief medical officer of health said they do not belong in the priority groups.</p>
<p>"I can't speak for the other board members, but I did feel that if the medical staff had made the decision that it was important for all of us who are in and out of the hospital to be safe ... then it behooved us to listen to their safety caution," said Vicki Bismilla, vice-president at Centennial College, who received the shot as a member of The Scarborough Hospital's board of directors.</p>
<p>The hospital, which is vaccinating all physicians, staff and volunteers, said it is a long-standing policy to provide flu vaccines to all volunteers, "which in our case includes members of our board of directors," read a statement posted on the hospital's website.</p>
<p>Mt. Sinai vice-chairman Edward Sonshine said he understands why some people are crying foul.</p>
<p>"There's a natural resentment to that ... everyone says it's a two-tiered system and I certainly understand that," said Sonshine, who did not get vaccinated by the hospital (he got his from a physician).</p>
<p>Sonshine said board members regularly visit the hospital, so he can see why they should receive the vaccine ahead of the general public.</p>
<p>"Do I consider myself a health worker? No. Am I in the hospital a lot? Yes."</p>
<p>Other board members at various hospitals contacted by the Star refused to comment or referred reporters to hospital officials. Executives at a number of Toronto-area hospitals insisted Monday board members are health-care workers, and they denied any queue jumping. They said board members' families were not given priority access."As far as I'm concerned, we made the right decision and we're sticking with that," said John King, vice-president of St. Michael's Hospital.</p>
<p>King is also co-chair of the Toronto Academic Health Sciences Network (TAHSN). The network includes as full and associate members the following hospitals, all of which made the vaccine available to board members: St. Michael's, University Health Network, Mount Sinai, Sunnybrook, Bridgepoint, Toronto East General, North York General, St. Joseph's and Scarborough.</p>
<p>Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Arlene King (no relation) told a news conference on Friday that hospital board members are not health-care workers and should not be receiving early vaccine shots.</p>
<p>But John King said he and other TAHSN hospitals stand by their decisions despite her views: "Now that Arlene King has made that statement, would we think differently? The answer is no."</p>
<p>The province received a new shipment of 770,000 doses of the vaccine Monday, but there is still no indication of when it will be offered to healthy Ontarians. It includes 395,000 doses of an adjuvanted formulation and 375,000 unadjuvanted, which is recommended for pregnant women. The province hopes that by Wednesday it will have delivered all the adjuvanted vaccine delivered to the province's 36 health units, some of which, like Peel, have run out. The vaccine continues to be rationed to six priority groups: health-care workers, pregnant women, people under 65 with chronic conditions, children six months to under 5 years of age, people living in isolated communities, and household contacts and care providers of those who cannot be immunized.</p>
<p>But a public outcry has erupted over queue jumping by some professional athletes and hospital board members.</p>
<p>A union representing hospital workers last week called for board members who jumped the queue to resign, saying they are guilty of a serious ethical lapse.</p>
<p>King said TAHSN began working on a pandemic plan more than four years ago, prompted by the SARS outbreak, and a decision was made in the interest of business continuity to vaccinate all employees and volunteers who help the hospital function.</p>
<p>That means employees in finance, human resources, housekeeping and the cafeteria have been invited to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>However, not all hospitals are providing the vaccine to board members, and some board members who have been offered the vaccine have turned it down.</p>
<p>"I'm not high risk and I have not got it," said Murad Jiwani, a member of the board at Toronto East General and president of construction risk strategist IMJ Management Inc.</p>
<p>Gerry Schwartz, the billionaire investor who sits on Mt. Sinai's board, said he was in California on the day vaccinations were being offered at a board meeting.</p>
<p>Upon his return, he was baffled to discover media reports that he and wife Heather Reisman, the head of Indigo Books, had received early vaccinations.</p>
<p>He said he has yet to get his shot. As for his wife, she attended the hospital meeting but turned down the vaccination.</p>
<p>"I think everybody should get it at the same time," he said, when asked whether board members should be vaccinated along with health-care workers. "I will get mine eventually."</p>
<p>Tom Closson, president of the Ontario Hospital Association, said hospitals simply acted in "good faith" and followed a directive issued by the Public Health Agency of Canada on Sept. 16. The document, on PHAC's website, provides a broader definition of each priority group. According to PHAC, the definition of health-care worker includes: "full-time staff, part-time staff, students, regular visitors and volunteers i.e. all persons carrying out the health-care function."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Stelmach is safe ... for now</b>
</div><div>Gillian Steward   </div>
<div>Special to The Star</div>
<div>631 words</div><div>10 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A23</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach got the support he needed from his party last weekend. Now he just has to convince the rest of the province that his government is on the right track. That may not be so easy.</p>
<p>Although 77 per cent of the 1,200 delegates to the PC convention in Red Deer voted against holding a leadership contest, many of them admitted they didn't have much choice. There is no obvious successor to the premier, and a divisive fight for the party crown less than two years after Stelmach won 72 out of 83 seats could fatally weaken the party.</p>
<p>So they chose to back him even though the day before the convention an Environics poll found only 34 per cent of Albertans favour the Tories. Nipping at their heels is the upstart Wildrose Alliance with 28 per cent. In Calgary, the new party, which has only one seat in the Legislature and a brand new, untested leader, is more popular than the Stelmach Conservatives.</p>
<p>The mighty party of Peter Lougheed and Ralph Klein has fallen fast. All the problems brought on by the recession are being blamed on the Stelmach Conservatives. Many wonder why a government that was once awash in billion dollar surpluses now has a $7 billion deficit.</p>
<p>The first week of the H1N1 flu vaccination program, which saw children, pregnant women and the elderly lining up outside in the bitter cold for hours while the Flames hockey team and their families got preferential treatment, outraged people across the province. But through it all Stelmach seemed unaware of what was really happening in the streets and hospitals as people sought help to combat swine flu.</p>
<p>It's this befuddled kind of leadership that has upset both those inside and outside the PC party. To many people, especially those under 45, Stelmach seems as old-fashioned and fuzzy as black-and-white television. He just doesn't fit with their idea of what it means to be Albertan.</p>
<p>And neither do his party stalwarts. At the PC convention, many of the delegates looked old and creaky, as if they had just stepped out of a Social Credit rally of the 1950s. When they sat down to lunch (provided by Imperial Oil) they seemed blissfully unaware that just across the street 700 people were loudly protesting against health-care cuts.</p>
<p>Contrast that stodginess with the image projected by Danielle Smith, the new leader of the Wildrose Alliance. She's 38, eager, attractive, smart and decidedly urban. She tweets and blogs. Young people identify with her. Even political veterans see her as a fresh new face and attitude that the province badly needs.</p>
<p>But there's no question that Smith and the Wildrose are reaping much more than they have sown simply because so many Albertans are angry with the Stelmach government. No one really knows how the Wildrose Alliance plans to revive the economy; or how it would improve the health-care system it so readily criticizes; or what it intends to do about the environmental damage caused by the oil sands; or if it even believes in climate change, let alone has a plan to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.</p>
<p>For now, it just seems good enough that they are not the Stelmach Conservatives but a younger, fresher version of Alberta conservatism. If it catches on, Ed Stelmach may well wish that his party had dumped him last weekend so he wouldn't be remembered as the premier who finally ushered out the Tory dynasty.</p>

<p>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan -- Canada is unlikely to dip into its limited supply of H1N1 vaccine to help meet Afghanistan's plea for help with a pandemic that has already claimed 11 lives in the country.</p>
<p>Civilian and military officials have indicated Canada's stockpiles of the vaccine are too low to make doses available to Afghan civilians.</p>
<p>There have been 779 confirmed cases of swine flu in Afghanistan since July, when the virus is believed to have spread from four U.S. soldiers at Bagram Air Base. Of those, 320 were identified among foreign troops.</p>
<p>"So far we don't have any preventive vaccines," said Dr. Ahmad Farid Raaid, a spokesperson for Afghanistan's health ministry.</p>
<p>Kabul expects 550,000 doses of H1N1 vaccine from World Health Organization donors by next week.</p>
<p>"If the situation deteriorates, we may need more medicine," he said.</p>
<p>Afghanistan has sent a request for support to Canada's embassy.</p>
<p>"We will try to help them ... but it may be difficult to respond to the request for vaccine given the shortages in Canada," Ambassador Bill Crosbie said.</p>

<p>She tweeted about having an "H1N1 daycare" after her two children were sent home from school when they weren't all that sick.</p>
<p>York Region mom Tracey Kent turned to Twitter to file quick, humorous observations about her experience last week with the flu everyone is talking about.</p>
<p>"My daughter coughed. Mayhem ensued," she tweeted last Monday. "Told to pick her up. No fever, nothing else. Schools beginning hysteria."</p>
<p>The next day? Her son had an upset stomach. "2nd kid home, any kid saying they aren't feeling well being sent home. School emptying. Think people are being played by kids."</p>
<p>Then, later on: "Running H1N1 daycare in my house. School sending kids home (en masse) ... One of symptoms is lame cough & ability to play Nintendo all day. Crazy."</p>
<p>Kent, whose children returned to school on Thursday, joked that rather than being sick, "I think it was a matter of not wanting to write a test" for one of her offspring.</p>
<p>Kids, of course, are always looking for an excuse to get out of school. And, in some cases, school staff might be overly cautious in sending them home.</p>
<p>But there's no doubt school boards have been grappling with outbreaks.</p>
<p>Because H1N1 has hit the younger set particularly hard, children older than 6 months and younger than 5 years of age are among the priority groups for vaccines, given they are more at risk for serious complications, and school-age children are about to be added to the priority list.</p>
<p>The York Region District School board asks parents to be on the lookout for flu-like symptoms before sending their kids off to school, and if children do become sick at school, they are sent to a designated area where they are monitored away from other students.</p>
<p>It's up to principals to call home and have parents pick them up, and "a cough in and of itself, in the absence of other symptoms, doesn't send a child home," although such a decision is a judgment call, spokeswoman Lucia Cascioli said.</p>
<p>Toronto's public board is asking teachers to keep an eye out for symptoms, and parents are strongly encouraged to keep kids at home if they are at all ill.</p>
<p>School boards across Greater Toronto, as elsewhere, are reporting high absenteeism.</p>
<p>In Peel Region, 45 of 199 public elementary schools had absentee rates higher than 10 per cent on Wednesday, down from 57 schools the day before.</p>
<p>The Toronto public board says 64 of 562 schools - or about 11 per cent - have high absenteeism, as do 41 of 193 York public schools.</p>
<p>In Durham, 54 of 130 schools reported more than 10 per cent of students away sick, with a couple recording absenteeism of at least 20 per cent.</p>
<p>Mark Joel, a superintendent of education with the Durham District School Board, said absentee rates at this time of year are usually between 1 and 3 per cent.</p>
<p>The Durham board has tracked the flu as it moved from northeast Oshawa, and the "wave is moving to Whitby and north," said Joel, whose own son has just recovered from H1N1.</p>
<p>"What we are finding is that kids are generally off school for three to four days. My own son had it and slept for three days."</p>
<p>The board isn't sending homework to bedridden kids - "they are in no shape to be doing homework" but rather asking that teachers help them catch up once they return.</p>
<p>His son, a Grade 11 student, missed three days of school, then went in early or stayed late when he returned, Joel added.</p>

<p>Many Canadians are upset that well-connected hospital insiders have gone to the front of the line for H1N1 immunization, ahead even of vulnerable children. They ought to be. The explanation for giving limited supplies of vaccine to hospital board members - and, in Quebec, even to wealthy donors - remains unconvincing.</p>
<p>Business executives, former politicians and the other insiders who tend to sit on hospital boards cannot reasonably be described as health-care workers. Yet several Toronto hospitals are justifying the immunization of their board members on the ground that they are part of health-care "team."</p>
<p>Supplies of flu vaccine remain distressingly limited. Besides frontline health-care workers, the priority groups for H1N1 immunization include children under 5, people in remote communities, and those with dangerous chronic conditions, such as heart disease and asthma. For them, receiving the vaccine could be a matter of life and death. Until they are looked after, no well-informed person who is not in a priority group should be getting a protective shot.</p>
<p>Health ministry officials in both Ontario and Quebec have clearly - and correctly - stated that people should not consider themselves entitled to H1N1 vaccine because they serve on a hospital board. The same goes for hospital donors and hockey and basketball players. By jumping the queue, they have undermined public confidence that our health-care system is being run on a fair and equitable basis.</p>

<div>Report on Business: Canadian</div>
<div id="hd"><b>A SHAKY CONVALESCENCE? Despite an anticipated upswing next year, a high loonie, rising fuel costs and an H1N1 virus threat could make recovery more difficult for some sectors than others</b>
</div><div>Virginia Galt    </div>
<div>426 words</div><div>10 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Profits are expected to start picking up next year, after plunging more than 20 per cent in 2009 across a range of industries analyzed by the Conference Board of Canada. The recovery could be shaky, however, especially in sectors threatened by the high Canadian dollar, climbing fuel costs and the potential spread of the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Vulnerable to the flu</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus could put additional pressure on the recession-battered food services and accommodation sectors, the Conference Board said yesterday in a report it prepared with the <span class="companylink">Business Development Bank of Canada</span>.</p>
<p>Airlines would also be affected. Widespread H1N1 infections would reduce willingness to travel “and eventually lead to outright travel restrictions being put in place,” the board said. Trade restrictions – like bans on Canadian pork by Venezuela, China and Russia in response to H1N1 (known as swine flu) – could limit food manufacturers' export growth.</p>
<p>Dollar woes …</p>
<p>In addition to the overall reduction in discretionary spending, the hospitality sector is suffering as a result of our strong currency, which makes Canada a more expensive destination for travellers. With the loonie expected to remain close to parity with the greenback, this is also an issue for export-dependent industries, such as the food and beverage manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>… and benefits</p>
<p>The strong loonie has been a big source of savings in the wholesale trade sector because a large portion of goods sold by wholesalers are imported.</p>
<p>In the current highly competitive environment, however, wholesalers are cutting into their profit margins by passing on recent cost savings from the high loonie to their customers.</p>
<p>Oil price concerns Oil prices remain high and are expected to rise further. The board says this will “continue to challenge profitability” in the transportation sector, already battered by lower travel demand, along with diminishing global trade and manufacturing production.</p>
<p>Low consumer confidence This has cut across a range of industries – retail, hospitality, travel and wholesale trade. In the retail sector, weak consumer demand, combined with price cuts, has slashed industry profits by 32 per cent, to an estimated $8.6-billion in 2009, from $12.6-billion last year, the board said.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the strong dollar benefits retailers by lowering the cost of imports. And, as employment levels and income begin to recover, “so too will retail sales.”</p>

<p>Corporations love being associated with superstar athletes, big-time movie stars or popular rock bands. But H1N1?</p>
<p>The global H1N1 flu pandemic is proving to be a marketing bonanza for many companies that have turned the virus into a sponsorship frenzy.</p>
<p>From trade conventions to baseball games, mixed martial arts fights and even the Vancouver Olympics, business is booming for corporate sponsorships tied to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Yesterday California-based <span class="companylink">Bio-Clean Inc</span>. announced it was sponsoring Randy (The Natural) Couture in his upcoming Ultimate Fighting Championship match against Brandon Vera. The company said the sponsorship would be an excellent way to showcase its Clean Kill hand sanitizer which, it added, “is the world's best choice in the battle against H1N1.”</p>
<p>“The company believes that Randy (The Natural) Couture embodies the All-American image of strength and intelligence that <span class="companylink">Bio-Clean</span>'s Clean Kill Personal Hand Sanitizing Weapon is designed to portray,” <span class="companylink">Bio-Clean</span> said in a press release.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, Terry Owen said few people had ever heard of his company, ALDA Pharmaceuticals, when it signed a sponsorship deal last summer with the Vancouver Olympics.</p>
<p>The deal made ALDA the first “official supplier of hand sanitizers and disinfectant cleaning products for the Games,” according to Olympic organizers. Now Mr. Owen said ALDA can barely keep up with demand for its T36 hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>“With the H1N1 pandemic coming at the same time [as the sponsorship deal] and there being kind of a shortage of hand sanitizers in the market right now, everything has really kind of aligned in our favour,” Mr. Owen said yesterday.</p>
<p>Fear of H1N1 and other health hazards prompted organizers of the 2010 Cable Show in Los Angeles to offer a sponsorship spot for the convention's “official hand sanitizer.”</p>
<p>For $20,000 (U.S.), “your brand appears on individual-size hand sanitizer bottles distributed at registration and the information kiosks throughout the convention centre,” the organizers said on the website of the convention, which brings together hundreds of cable television and telecommunications companies. “It's a novel and highly appreciated sponsorship vehicle that will keep you top of mind (and close at hand) throughout the show.”</p>
<p>Convention planner MaryBeth Powers, who runs Virginia-based Planning Powers, offers “H1N1 sponsorship ideas” on her website. “Sponsors can benefit from the worries of Swine Flu (H1N1),” she says. “Have your sponsors donate personal-size antibacterial gel bottles, wipes and/or a packet of tissues. Your meeting attendees will love them.”</p>
<p>Then there's Vi-Jon Inc., a St. Louis-based company that makes Germ-X hand sanitizers. Vi-John ran ads during broadcasts of St. Louis Cardinals baseball games featuring the product as the team's “preferred hand sanitizer.”</p>
<p>“When it comes to fighting germs, you have to play hardball,” the team's play-by-play announcer John Rooney said in the ads.</p>
<p>“That's why I use Germ-X, the instant hand sanitizer. I just apply Germ-X to my hands, rub it in for 15 seconds, then I'm ready to throw germs out at the plate.”</p>

</div><div>By Jen Skerritt    </div>

<p>Two children in pediatric intensive care are being tested for H1N1 as Winnipeg emergency rooms continue to see a large number of children with respiratory illness.</p>
<p>Winnipeg Regional Health Authority spokeswoman Heidi Graham said there are eight children on ventilators in pediatric intensive care, including two children who are being tested for severe H1N1. The number of children presenting to emergency with respiratory symptoms is up more than 30 per cent.</p>
<p>Graham said 170 people went to children's emergency on Sunday -- up from the average 110 patient visits on a typical day.</p>
<p>More than half of children who have gone to the ER have respiratory symptoms.</p>
<p>"We've recognized the number of visits to emergency departments are increasing," Graham said. "They're up everywhere, (but) mostly at Children's (Hospital)."</p>
<p>Last week, health officials asked Manitobans to avoid any unnecessary visits to emergency rooms that could soon fill up with people sick with flu. Health officials expect the number of people sick with H1N1 to increase in the coming weeks as the second wave of influenza enters its peak.</p>
<p>As of last Wednesday -- the latest numbers available from officials -- 20 people have been hospitalized for severe respiratory illness, including one lab-confirmed case of severe H1N1. Health officials expect most, if not all, of the severe cases will turn out to be H1N1.</p>
<p>The first suspected flu death this season is under review, but no details about the person's age or gender have been made public.</p>
<p>The increased pressure on emergency rooms has prompted city health officials to try to move hospital patients to personal care homes to free up beds.</p>
<p>Graham said that will allow hospital staff to move people out of emergency onto the wards faster -- the same thing officials did when hospitals started to fill up with sick flu patients last spring.</p>
<p>To date, more than 100,000 Winnipeggers have been vaccinated against H1N1. Health officials hope mass vaccinations could shorten the severity and duration of the second wave of H1N1.</p>
<p>Flu clinics are closed due to a dwindling vaccine supply, but are slated to reopen Thursday morning after Manitoba receives its next shipment.</p>
<p>During the peak of the first wave of H1N1, 38 people were on ventilators in city hospitals and health officials shifted surgeries around to deal with the increased demand for beds.</p>

<p>37 schools report high absenteeism</p>
<p>MANITOBA had 37 public schools reporting higher than usual absences as of noon Monday, the first time high absenteeism exceeded 30 schools since mandatory reporting began a month ago.</p>
<p>The 37 schools were spread across 18 divisions, all but three of them rural.</p>
<p>Three city schools in River East Transcona S.D. reported higher than usual levels Monday: John Pritchard, John W. Gunn and Lord Wolseley.</p>
<p>Lakeshore and Turtle River school divisions have consistently reported unusual absence levels since the department of education told divisions a month ago to post daily school-by-school absence reports on their websites.</p>
<p>The province has noted higher than usual absence levels are not necessarily flu-related.</p>
<p>Manitoba Health says it will not identify the community or institutions in which confirmed H1N1 cases occur, unless there is a compelling public health reason to do so.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccine shortage forcing many clinics to close; Delay comes as hospital admissions rise</b>

<p>A shortage of H1N1 vaccine is forcing flu clinics in many parts of the country to shut their doors this week at a time when more Canadians are being admitted to hospital, leaving healthy people in limbo over when they will get the shot.</p>
<p>Some clinics in Manitoba and New Brunswick have temporarily closed, and British Columbia's Provincial Health Officer said closures could be imminent as the province drains the rest of its vaccine supply.</p>
<p>“As this week's stock of vaccine runs out, clinics scheduled for later in the week may be closed. But that will be determined on a regional basis and it will depend on the demand and how much vaccine is used up,” Perry Kendall said yesterday in a conference call.</p>
<p>The national shortage is because Canada's sole vaccine supplier, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, was forced to make changes to its production line in mid-course to manufacture a version of the vaccine for pregnant women. Only 436,000 doses were shipped to the provinces and territories last week, far less than the roughly two million anticipated.</p>
<p>Federal health officials and the company have said the plant in Ste-Foy, Que., has ramped up production and millions of doses are now being produced each week.</p>
<p>But the production glitch came at an unfortunate time: Hospitalizations and intensive-care admissions were up almost three-fold in the last week of October compared with the previous week, and more people have died from H1N1 in Alberta, Quebec, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
<p>GSK started shipping another 1.8 million doses of vaccine this week. But by the time it reaches the provinces, gets repackaged and sent to local health units, it could be the end of the week or as late as next Monday before needles get into arms.</p>
<p>Vera Etches, associate medical officer of health in Ottawa, said Ottawa Public Health's remaining 30,000 doses will hold clinics until tomorrow. Dr. Etches hopes that by that time another shipment will have arrived.</p>
<p>In Alberta, André Corriveau, the province's Chief Medical Officer of Health, said it's difficult at this point to guess when people not in the priority groups will be offered the vaccine.</p>
<p>“The problem is we only find out one week at a time how much we're getting the week after. So if I knew for a fact that we're getting 300,000 doses a week for the next few weeks, I could give you a prediction. But right now, we just find out one week at a time. We'll go there as soon as we can,” Dr. Corriveau said.</p>
<p>The shortage has resulted in online scammers trying to make a quick buck.</p>
<p>Police in Victoria are investigating a case of someone claiming to be a public health nurse trying to sell a vial of vaccine on the Internet to the highest bidder. The posting has been taken down, Dr. Kendall said.</p>
<p>“No one, especially a person who has the bad taste to pose as a nurse, should be offering healthy people the option of seeking preferential treatment and jumping a queue,” Dr. Kendall said. “Nor should they be seeking monetary benefits by openly running counter to the rules that the rest of the public health system is following. This is unacceptable.”</p>

<p>Burlington, Ont. -- Lisa Priest's report that H1N1 vaccines for the general public will arrive after the second wave is nearly over puts this fiasco in real perspective (For Many, Vaccine Will Be Available After Flu Peaks – Nov. 9). Unfortunately, these are the same people who run our health care. How much more gets bungled up when the whole world isn't watching?</p>
<p>What are officials going to do with all this vaccine that Canadians won't want by the time it's available? Ship it to Yulia Tymoshenko (The Ministry Of Misinformation: Flu Fears And Rumours Paralyze Ukraine – front page, Nov. 9)?</p>

<p>Canada is well into the second wave of the H1N1 influenza pandemic, and yet most children over the age of five remain unvaccinated, two weeks into a mass immunization campaign. Children should be given immediate priority, now that immunizations of the “priority groups” are winding up.</p>
<p>Children are often said to deserve first call on a nation's resources. They certainly deserve the utmost in protection at a time of a public-health emergency. It is not enough to say – as health and school authorities have been saying until now – that children have been instructed to sneeze into their elbows, wash their hands frequently and stay home if ill. Those instructions are fine as far as they go, though children and, frankly, many adults are not terribly committed, by nature, to following them. In any event, children should not bear the ultimate responsibility for self-protection from a potentially severe illness. It's the job of adults to protect children.</p>
<p>Far from having first call on protection, children between the ages of five and nine may lag many Canadians, because they require two half-doses of the vaccine, 21 days apart. Older Canadians need just one dose.</p>
<p>Children are probably the most active agents of the spread of the disease. They do not simply pass it to one another. They share it generously. They bring it to the very at-risk populations that Canada sought to protect first (aboriginals, health-care workers, children under five, pregnant women, adults with chronic conditions). To protect children, then, is a good way to protect the broader community.</p>
<p>There is epidemiological evidence from the United States that children are at higher than normal risk of death or severe illness, according to Saskatchewan's Medical Officer of Health, Moira McKinnon. For that reason, Saskatchewan is beginning this week to inoculate schoolchildren from kindergarten to Grade 6. Alberta, by contrast, is adding two new priority groups: parents of children under six months and children under 10 with chronic health conditions such as obesity or diabetes. This may reflect Ottawa's painfully slow rollout of the vaccine, but it leaves the majority of children unprotected. Even if the disease is mostly mild in children, it has killed healthy children, such as a 13-year-old elite athlete in Toronto. “A small number will develop life-threatening or fatal illness,” says Andrew Simor, head of microbiology and infectious diseases at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto.</p>
<p>To sit back any longer is to tolerate some avoidable deaths of children.</p>

<p>Did the future attack?</p>
<p>“It is the machine that scientists hope will recreate the conditions present at the beginning of time,” Adam Gabbatt writes in The Guardian. But scientists at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) found their plans to emulate the big bang postponed last week when a passing bird dropped a “bit of baguette” into the machine, causing it to overheat. “CERN, the European particle physics laboratory, launched the LHC with much fanfare on Sept. 10 last year. Physicists hope to use the collider to prove the existence of the Higgs boson, or God particle, which gives matter in the universe its mass. But the collider, which when running will collide protons travelling at 99.9 per cent of the speed of light, has been out of action for over a year after a helium leak caused it to be shut down on Sept. 19, 2008, nine days after its start-up. The particle accelerator, which is buried 100 metres underground near Geneva, is currently undergoing tests ahead of its proposed restart date later this month, but the testing process was stopped [last] Monday after the power supply to the collider was cut.” Physicists Holger Nielsen of Copenhagen and Masao Ninomiya of Japan, Britain's The Sun reports, “say the consequences of finding the boson … may be so dangerous that scientists yet to be born are trying to prevent it. … Dr. Nielsen said: ‘It is as if something is going back in time to keep the universe from being hit by a bus.' ”</p>
<p>Student papers, ugh</p>
<p>To celebrate Global Handwashing Day last month, well-known Japanese choreographer Kaiji Moriyama composed a hand-washing dance especially for the day, Catherine Makino reports for the Los Angeles Times. With the arrival of the H1N1 virus, the nation has become even more focused than usual on hygiene. “Hiroshi Shoji, an English-language instructor in Saitama prefecture near Tokyo, said children usually wash their hands and gargle in the winter, but now it is many times a day – and after every activity.” Mr. Shoji's wife, Sandra, an instructor at Tokyo International University, said teachers have become cautious. “We use handkerchiefs to open doors,” she said. “We use wipes after touching computers or students' papers. More teachers are having students send homework by e-mail or a university e-group. That way, teachers don't have to touch lots of germy papers.”</p>
<p>Cellphone's dad speaks</p>
<p>“Martin Cooper, who was the lead engineer of the <span class="companylink">Motorola</span> team that developed the mobile phone, told a privacy conference in Madrid [last] week that today's phones try to do many things for too many people,” Rachel Cooper writes for The Daily Telegraph. “ ‘Whenever you create a universal device that does all things for all people, it does not do any things well,' said the 80-year-old, who made the first wireless call from a busy Manhattan street corner on April 3, 1973. ‘Our future I think is a number of specialist devices that focus on one thing that will improve our lives,' said Mr. Cooper.”</p>
<p>In loco parentis</p>
<p>“A Brazilian university has publicly expelled a woman who was heckled by hundreds of fellow students for wearing a short, pink skirt to class, taking out newspaper ads [Sunday] to publicly accuse her of immorality,” Associated Press reports. “The private Bandeirante University in Sao Bernardo do Campo, outside of Sao Paulo, said 20-year-old Geisy Arruda disrespected ‘ethical principles and academic dignity and morality.' ”</p>
<p>Road trains?</p>
<p>“Road trains that link vehicles together using wireless sensors could soon be on European roads,” BBC News reports. “An EU-financed research project is looking at inexpensive ways of getting vehicles to travel in a ‘platoon' on Europe's motorways. Each road train could include up to eight separate vehicles – cars, buses and trucks will be mixed in each one. The EU hopes to cut fuel consumption, journey times and congestion by linking vehicles together. …The lead vehicle would be handled by a professional driver who would monitor the status of the road train. Those in following vehicles could take their hands off the wheel, read a book or watch TV, while they travel along the motorway. Their vehicle would be autonomously controlled by the lead vehicle.”</p>
<p>Oldest divorcÉes</p>
<p>A British couple have become the oldest couple in the world to divorce – at the age of 98, Ananova.com reports. Bertie and Jessie Wood ended their 36-year marriage when they were both two years away from their 100th birthdays. According to neighbours of the former couple, Mrs. Wood now lives in a care home but Mr. Wood died shortly before he turned 99.</p>

<p>It disgusts me that, on a daily basis, we learn of more individuals who are not deemed to be in the high-risk category weaseling to the front of the line to receive H1N1 shots.</p>
<p>I am disgusted, but not surprised, as I am sure these people are of the same mind as those who would push women and children out of the way to be the first in the lifeboats on a sinking ship or the first out the burning building without offering assistance to anyone else.</p>
<p>I wonder if they have any thoughts on the people who are in the high-risk categories who have died from the flu and if their selfishness somehow contributed. I wonder, but I doubt it. Shame on all of you.</p>

<p>Seven more deaths linked to the H1N1 virus were confirmed yesterday, as Health Canada announced a webcast to be held today to discuss how one of the most vulnerable populations -- First Nations people -- can best combat the illness.</p>
<p>The virus contributed to five deaths in Alberta, bringing the toll in that province to 25, while a 48-year-old man and a 69-year-old woman from Newfoundland and Labrador also died from complications associated with the virus.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services also announced plans to begin inoculating children younger than 10, starting today.</p>
<p>Health Canada, meanwhile, issued a news release saying that Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and Vancouver Island's Shawn Atleo, the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, would co-host the First Nations H1N1 Virtual Summit.</p>
<p>The two will take part in the webcast designed to give First Nations communities an opportunity to exchange information on H1N1. --</p>

<p>Michelle Englot has already endured enough worry to carry her through the Canadian Olympic curling team pre-trials in Prince George.</p>
<p>The Regina skip had to find an alternate in case second Roberta Materi wasn't able to make the trip to Prince George for the pre-trials, which start today. Materi, who came down with a severe case of the flu Nov. 1, recovered in time to make the trip with her team yesterday.</p>
<p>Materi's week-long battle with the flu meant Englot still added Regina's Debbie Lozinski as a fifth player as insurance.</p>
<p>"Roberta is 100 per cent,'' Englot said yesterday after arriving in Prince George. "She'll be fine by game time but if someone does come down sick we do have a backup. Hopefully, we won't need her.''</p>
<p>Englot said that Materi wasn't tested for the H1N1 virus but suffered from the same symptoms. The uncertainty surrounding her second caused Englot some consternation.</p>
<p>"We were really prepared until the flu hit,'' said Englot. "We decided in our planning that we weren't going to take a fifth. That turned out not to be a great decision.''</p>
<p>Englot added that the rest of her team -- third Deanna Doig and lead Cindy Simmons -- are healthy.</p>
<p>Four men's and four women's teams from the pre-trials advance to the Canadian Olympic team trials, Dec. 6-13 in Edmonton.</p>
<p>The timing of Materi's illness couldn't be worse considering the effort Englot and Co. have put into preparing for the pre-trials. The foursome embarked on a strenuous conditioning program with the assistance of personal trainers. Englot said she has never been in better physical condition, especially compared to 2001 when she took part in the Olympic team trials in Regina.</p>
<p>"We prepared [in 2001] but never anything like we have this year,'' said Englot. "The funding we got for the off-ice training and everything else . . . we never had any of that in 2001. From where it's gone in eight years is amazing.''</p>
<p>Englot said the support has removed any excuses from their preparations for this year's pre-trials.</p>
<p>"From a physical point of view, this team is in better shape than any I've played with,'' said the 45-year-old Englot, who is a six-time Saskatchewan women's champion. "We've taken advantage of every opportunity and because I'm eight years older [than in 2001], I had to work harder to be in better shape than anyone else.''</p>
<p>Twelve men's -- including Brad Gushue, Jeff Stoughton and Wayne Middaugh -- and 12 women's team -- including Kelly Scott and Marie-France Larouche -- are vying for the Olympic berths. Some have known for two years that they are in the pre-trials and others clinched berths in April. Now, they are in the same situation with similar goals.</p>
<p>"Basically it's a do-or-die competition,'' said Englot. "Either the dream remains alive or it dies in Prince George. We need to approach it with the same urgency. This year, we had put a little bit too much pressure on ourselves for results and we've decided to go and have fun.</p>
<p>"Whatever happens happens and it's not like we do this for a living. It's supposed to be a fun sport and we're hoping to have a relaxed approach. Hopefully, things will come together.''</p>

</p>
<p>As Canadians approach our national day of remembrance, it seems imperative that we remind ourselves of purpose.</p>
<p>That purpose is twofold. First, to honour those who served, and especially those who died, "to preserve and to protect" Canada's free, open, democratic society.</p>
<p>Second, Remembrance Day is for reflection upon values of those freedoms protected and preserved. It is this reflection that should warrant rather more intense introspection.</p>
<p>Since the horrors of 9-11, governments worldwide have responded, often arbitrarily, to alleged threats to public safety by imposing often stringent and oppressive constraints on freedoms.</p>
<p>Interestingly, of course, many of the worst offenders were governments wherein the word freedom coincided with opposition and dissent and where, consequently, the excuse of combatting terrorism was a convenient means for further quelling dissonance.</p>
<p>Authoritarian regimes welcome opportunities to quash non-conforming behaviours and minorities. Egypt, for example, responded to the H1N1 flu threat by ordering the destruction of herds of pigs. An action as much an assault upon minority religious groups as a contribution to control of a looming epidemic.</p>
<p>In less autocratic societies, where governments are ostensibly democratic, terrorism threats have been used to regulate everything from what you can carry on airplanes to what you need to simply attend a hockey game in Detroit.</p>
<p>If Remembrance Day is about reacquainting ourselves with the purpose of sacrificed lives, then it seems singularly appropriate to ask ourselves how far we have permitted erosion of freedom from the benchmarks for which so many Canadians fought and died.</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, well-intentioned Canadians risk their lives and our tax dollars to offer a modicum of hope to a portion of the Afghan population. But, if our troops are risking their lives and our dollars to spawn basic freedom in a country which has never experienced widespread freedom, are they also engaged in protecting our freedom?</p>
<p>Inherently in Canada's commitment to a peace-sustaining role in Afghanistan is the shadow belief that our troops are equally protecting our safety and hence our freedom.</p>
<p>But, would it not also be somewhat of an irony that while Canadians are risking lives and tax dollars in Afghanistan, we are also slowly undermining that panoply of freedoms and rights inherent to Canadian citizenship?</p>
<p>We already tolerate enormous incursions upon personal privacy and freedom at airports in the interests of combatting terrorism. For how long should Canadians continue to tolerate such intrusions is an unresolved public policy issue.</p>
<p>Similarly, when one enters Canada from away, we now can be subjected to random personal searches. Entry into Windsor via the tunnel is now subject to random vehicle searches. This too is a public policy issue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, trial balloons are currently being floated in respect to permitting random breathalyzer testing at RIDE police roadblocks. MADD -- the leading anti-drunk driving organization -- apparently supports such random testing.</p>
<p>One cannot in any manner defend drinking and driving. Indeed, harsher penalties for persons engaged in driving while intoxicated are an absolute essential. But, would a campaign to control alcohol-induced stupidity be enhanced by a serious assault upon personal freedom and individual rights? This, too, is a significant public policy issue.</p>
<p>There is always, in a complex and often confused society, a point where individual freedom and personal privacy -- the individual good -- must be played off against public good. Mandatory use of seatbelts in automobiles is a case in point.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are persons who seem to live in mortal fear of any form of aberrant or unusual behaviour and, under pretexts of public order or public safety or public security, there are those who press for even more constraints upon freedom.</p>
<p>Freedom is a precious commodity not to be squandered in myopic panic.</p>
<p>Remembrance Day should serve as an occasion to remind ourselves that there are strange prices for freedom.</p>

<p>Forget about fall -- it's flu season. If you've been on a plane, train, ship or any other form of public transportation recently, there has been someone nearby coughing, sneezing or sniffling.</p>
<p>Travel puts people in close proximity to others who very likely are carrying a flu virus. So hygiene awareness is key, whether the concern is H1N1 or seasonal flu. <span class="companylink">O'Hare International</span> and Midway airports have signs and announcements in English and Spanish promoting healthy practices.</p>
<p>H1N1, or swine flu, knows no borders. That's why airlines and cruise lines have been preparing for the worst by cleaning planes and ships and cautioning employees to follow guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The Air Transport Association, representing leading U.S. airlines, said it and its carriers keep in close contact with the CDC on actions to prevent the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">United Airlines</span> says the ventilation system on its planes uses hospital-grade air filters to control the spread of germs.</p>
<p>The association says generally, airlines won't bar passengers who have health issues, but each has the authority to deny boarding to a person who poses a threat or might appear to be ill.</p>
<p>Be aware that if you are travelling internationally, other countries may have you fill out a form about your health or have you pass through a scanning device that checks your temperature.</p>
<p>The Cruise Lines International Association, which represents 25 lines, said it is also in constant contact with the CDC and international health organizations. As an enhanced screening procedure, all passengers are required to fill out and sign a health questionnaire before boarding.</p>
<p>If someone becomes ill on a cruise, some ships are equipped with anti-viral medications and can isolate the passenger.</p>
<p>The most important thing you must do, whether flying or cruising, is to be honest with yourself about your own condition. Follow these tips to better protect yourself and others:</p>
<p>- Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners and anti-bacterial moist wipes also are effective.</p>
<p>- Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, because you can spread germs that way.</p>
<p>- Cover your nose or mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</p>
<p>- Throw the tissue in the trash afterward. If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper arm, not your hands.</p>
<p>- If you are sick with a flulike illness, stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care and other necessities.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Englot adds insurance for curling pre-trials</b>
</div><div>Murray McCormick   </div>
<div>Saskatchewan News Network; Regina Leader-Post</div>
<div>872 words</div><div>10 November 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>Michelle Englot has endured enough worry to carry her through the Canadian Olympic curling team pre-trials in Prince George, B.C.</p>
<p>The Regina skip had to find an alternate in case second Roberta Materi wasn't able to make the trip to Prince George for the pre-trials, which start today. Materi, who came down with a severe case of the flu Nov. 1, recovered in time to make the trip with her team Monday.</p>
<p>Materi's week-long battle with the flu meant Englot still added Regina's Debbie Lozinski as a fifth player as insurance.</p>
<p>"Roberta is 100 per cent," Englot said Monday after arriving in Prince George. "She'll be fine by game time but if someone does come down sick we do have a backup. Hopefully we won't need her."</p>
<p>Englot said Materi wasn't tested for the H1N1 virus but suffered from the same symptoms. The uncertainty surrounding her second caused Englot some consternation.</p>
<p>"We were really prepared until the flu hit," said Englot. "We decided in our planning that we weren't going to take a fifth. That turned out not to be a great decision."</p>
<p>Englot added that the rest of her team -- third Deanna Doig and lead Cindy Simmons -- are healthy.</p>
<p>Englot is one of three Saskatchewan-based skips on the women's side of the pre-trials. The others are Kronau's Amber Holland and Saskatoon's Sherry Anderson. Pat Simmons and Joel Jordison, who both curl out of Moose Jaw, are on the men's side.</p>
<p>Four men's and four women's teams from the pre-trials advance to the Canadian Olympic team trials, Dec. 6-13 in Edmonton. Saskatoon's</p>
<p>Stefanie Lawton has already qualified for the main trials.</p>
<p>The timing of Materi's illness couldn't be worse considering the effort Englot and Co. have put into preparing for the pre-trials. The foursome embarked on a strenuous conditioning program with the assistance of personal trainers. Englot said she has never been in better physical condition, especially compared to 2001 when she took part in the Olympic team trials in Regina.</p>
<p>"We prepared (in 2001) but never anything like we have this year," said Englot. "The funding we got for the off-ice training and everything else . . . we never had any of that in 2001. From where it's gone in eight years is amazing."</p>
<p>Englot said the support has removed any excuses from their preparations for this year's pre-trials.</p>
<p>"From a physical point of view, this team is in better shape than any I've played with," said the 45-year-old Englot, who is a six-time Saskatchewan women's champion. "We've taken advantage of every opportunity and because I'm eight years older (than in 2001), I had to work harder to be in better shape than anyone else."</p>
<p>Twelve men's and 12 women's team are vying for the Olympic trials berths. Some have known for two years that they are in the pre-trials and others clinched berths in April. Now, they are in the same situation with similar goals.</p>
<p>"Basically it's a do-or-die competition," said Englot. "Either the dream remains alive or it dies in Prince George. We need to approach it with the same urgency. This year, we had put a little bit too much pressure on ourselves for results and we've decided to go and have fun.</p>
<p>"Whatever happens, happens and it's not like we do this for a living. It's supposed to be a fun sport and we're hoping to have a relaxed approach. Hopefully things will come together."</p>

</p>
<p>Readers outraged at the H1N1 vaccinations given to players of the Calgary Flames, the Abbotsford Heat and the Chilliwack Bruins should do further research before making outlandish claims.</p>
<p>To suggest the Flames had the team inoculated in a "deliberate attempt" to gain a competitive advantage is just silly. Pro athletes may not be in the highest-risk group but they are high-risk. Its a good idea to have players inoculated prior to them attending schools and hospitals as part of their charitable work.</p>
<p>The Heat players stood in line at a clinic like the rest of the public seeking the vaccine.</p>
<p>Isn't it a better use of our resources to use all the available vaccine rather than have it expire and be wasted, as was the case of the Chilliwack Bruins? The Bruins team physician had leftover vaccine from a clinic which would have expired before another clinic could have been held.</p>
<p>Rather than have the 11 doses expire and be wasted, it was offered to the Bruins players.</p>
<p>Don't take someone else's opinion as fact and then suggest the sky is falling. It's not.</p>

<p>It is very unsettling to read how certain arrogant athletes feel it is perfectly all right to push aside pregnant mothers, children and those with chronic heath issues in order to receive H1N1 shots prior to their turn. Then, when caught, they try to justify their actions.</p>
<p>This is no different than taking a lifejacket from a drowning person in order to give yourself a better chance at survival, or pushing your way onto a lifeboat ahead of women and children.</p>
<p>This practice is disgusting and anyone who did so shouldn't be allowed to play for Canada in the 2010 Olympics. It's not in the spirit of the games and they have already proven to the world they are gold-medal winners in the cowards category.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Police probe auction of H1N1 vaccine; Alleged nurse offered to administer 10 doses of highly sought-after jab</b>
</div><div>Richard Watts   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service; Times Colonist</div>
<div>461 words</div><div>10 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>Police in B.C. are investigating a possible attempt to auction the H1N1 vaccine on the Internet.</p>
<p>The ad was posted Monday morning by someone claiming to be a registered nurse. It was pulled a few hours later.</p>
<p>"Hello, I am a nurse with an extra vial of the H1N1 vaccine," the ad stated. "One vial will do 10 shots. I am willing to administer these shots to the highest bidder."</p>
<p>A national shortage of the vaccine has resulted in long lineups, with priority given to pregnant women and young children. Reports of queue-jumping by Calgary Flames players and their families, as well as hospital board members and donors in Toronto and Montreal, has fuelled national outrage.</p>
<p>In Victoria, Sgt. Grant Hamilton confirmed an investigation has been launched after a complaint was filed Monday about the ad, which was posted on the website UsedVictoria.com.</p>
<p>However, he wouldn't speculate on what charges might arise.</p>
<p>The ad said the auction would continue until midnight on Friday. After that, the nurse was to contact the highest bidder, come to the winner's home with proof of credentials and administer the shots.</p>
<p>"Good Luck," the ad concluded.</p>
<p>Attempts to reach the poster were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Luticia "Tish" Hill, general manager of UsedEverywhere.com, which runs UsedVictoria.com, said the company has now removed the ad and is co-operating with police.</p>
<p>Hill said the company has some private information about the person behind the ad, but refused to divulge it.</p>
<p>Suzanne Germaine, spokeswoman for the Vancouver Island Health Authority, said there is no legal way of obtaining the H1N1 vaccine in B.C. except through the public vaccinations -- so any vial posted for sale is likely stolen.</p>
<p>"If somebody is selling to the highest bidder, then it is theft," said Germaine. "It is morally wrong because it is taking vaccine away from pregnant women and kids."</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall, B.C. chief medical officer, said at his daily briefing Monday that nobody should consider buying vaccine over the Internet. "Don't do it. It is probably a scam," said Kendall.</p>
<p>If the person who placed the ad turns out to be a nurse, Kendall expects the College of Registered Nurses of B.C. to take disciplinary action.</p>
<p>"No one, especially someone who has the bad taste to pose as a nurse, should be offering healthy people preferential treatment and the offer of jumping the queue," he said.</p>
<p>Kendall also called the ad an "unacceptable slur" on the nursing profession.</p>
<p>He said that he doesn't have huge concerns about a black market developing for the vaccine.</p>

<p>The Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN) has opened a temporary call centre in Saskatoon to deal with an increasing number of H1N1-related calls.</p>
<p>First Nations individuals, communities and organizations searching for information about the H1N1 vaccine were phoning an FSIN line that handles questions about non-insured health benefits, said Martin Paul, the FSIN's director of health research.</p>
<p>He said the dozens of weekly H1N1 inquiries now can be answered when people call the toll-free number: 1-866-956-6442.</p>
<p>The service is available during regular FSIN business hours: Monday to Thursday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>

</p>
<p>Would we have noticed the H1N1 flu pandemic had health authorities not made such a big deal of it?</p>
<p>I don't think so. All this alarmist rigmarole is over something that otherwise would not even have registered. Except for the warning and the anxiety and the unseemly fretting over the precedence of vaccination, this looks to me pretty much like any other flu season.</p>
<p>Doctors' waiting rooms and hospital emergency rooms reportedly are crowded, but when are they not? If the neighbourhood doc-in-a-box is busier than usual, you have to wonder how many patients were persuaded to come in by excessive fear of H1N1.</p>
<p>The more obvious difference in doctors' waiting rooms is nothing to read. Magazines have been removed lest they become a vehicle for transmitting the virus. Now there's nothing to do but check out the other patients.</p>
<p>He doesn't look very sick . . .</p>
<p>As with the regular flu season, most people infected are quickly over it. As with the regular flu, there are exceptions, but H1N1 reportedly is no more virulent and, in most cases, less so. As with the regular flu, there are concentrations here and there, in schools, on sports teams and so on, but this is nothing we haven't seen before. Don Cherry has been talking about team flu epidemics on Coach's Corner for more than 20 years. He was among the first to promote individual water bottles. Only now are public health authorities catching up to Grapes.</p>
<p>It was a flu bug, supposedly, that impaired the Saskatchewan Roughriders when they lost last week to Hamilton. By this week, the Riders were well enough to pound the Calgary Stampeders into the turf and win first place in the West. Maybe we should all get the flu.</p>
<p>I had a touch of something myself a couple of weeks ago. Was it the dreaded H1N1? Who knows? What I do know is that it's a fairly benign plague when you're not even sure if you've had it.</p>
<p>Yes, people have died from H1N1 while others have been desperately ill. This is not unusual. The regular flu kills thousands of Canadians every year, but no one felt the need until now to hoist the black flag.</p>
<p>Among the most visible manifestations of H1N1 are so-called social distancing policies. At Saskatoon City Hall, employees are urged to stand at least six feet apart while talking. By this logic, you could only seat two at a seven-foot cafeteria table, and only on opposite ends of every other table. You'd need a long stick of some kind to pass the salt, if we're still allowed to pass the salt, that is.</p>
<p>The university is doing likewise. At public functions in Convocation Hall, chairs are now placed farther apart by about three inches on each side. Does it really make a difference if the guy with the hacking cough is three inches farther away? Maybe they should be six feet away like people talking at City Hall. Or maybe we should cancel public functions entirely until this H1N1 pandemic blows over. The problem would be noticing when it has blown over. Unless someone tells us, we might never know.</p>
<p>All over, the flu is prevailing over reason. University of Ottawa president Allan Rock, a former federal health minister, withheld the traditional handshake with graduates at their fall convocation ceremony. Then he handed them their degrees without using tongs or rubber gloves.</p>
<p>Also keeping their distance are Olympic officials in Vancouver. They are advising athletes against handshaking and kissing. Instead, the approved Olympic greeting gesture is to bump elbows. The elbow, apparently, is the new hand.</p>
<p>But wait. Aren't we supposed to cough into our elbow? Now we're told to greet others by touching them with what amounts to a staging area for expelled pathogens. You get the impression that someone has not thought this through. The elbow, apparently, is the new brain.</p>
<p>Churches, too, are discouraging human contact. Some have suspended communion and ritual handshaking. Next they'll be doing baptisms with Purell.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>An emergency at Public Safety Canada</b>
</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>458 words</div><div>10 November 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>B8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Auditor General Sheila Fraser, never one to pull her punches, has delivered a blistering attack on Public Safety Canada, charging that the federal department in charge of disasters is a disaster in its own right.</p>
<p>It would be hard to argue with her, given the evidence. Even though it was established six years ago, in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2003 power blackout that left the entire eastern seaboard in the dark, it still doesn't have a clear picture of its mandate.</p>
<p>Fraser charged in her recent report that Public Safety Canada doesn't prepare for emergencies. It reacts after the fact, and "has not exercised the leadership necessary to co-ordinate emergency management activities." For Canadians, there's probably no more topical issue right now than the H1N1 crisis, and Fraser was also highly critical of the Conservative government's failure to put a pandemic plan in place.</p>
<p>Even though we were warned of the outbreak last spring, the feds did not establish a strategy for dealing with it.</p>
<p>Only one manufacturer has been given the contract to make the vaccine for the entire population. The resulting shortage has led to widespread panic and confusion.</p>
<p>"Certainly an approved plan would have clearly indicated what the role was for Public Safety Canada," Fraser said, pointing out the obvious need to then co-ordinate a strategy with the provinces and municipalities.</p>
<p>One would expect Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan to be mortified by such a scathing critique. Instead, he foisted responsibility for emergency services and disaster management on to the provinces, and H1N1 on to Health Canada.</p>
<p>Van Loan also took the opportunity to remind us that "pandemic management" shouldn't be confused with national disasters and emergencies.</p>
<p>Pardon? Pandemics aren't public safety issues? This doesn't have the potential to be a national emergency if all those leading experts are right? The simple fact is that this department must shape up or shut down. Anything that compromises the country -- from floods to terrorist attacks to epidemics -- was meant to go through Van Loan's ministry.</p>
<p>Public Safety is supposed to be the lead agency, co-ordinating efforts with the provinces and, in the case of H1N1, Health Canada.</p>
<p>Fraser summed up her review by saying "it's important -- very important -- that the role and responsibilities of Public Safety Canada be agreed to and endorsed in these emergencies." We couldn't agree more. After six years, it is shocking to learn that Van Loan and his staff don't understand that. Public Safety Canada might be one of the biggest national dangers we face.</p>

</p>
<p>Here is some H1N1 information from www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca], a Health Canada website, where you will be able to find out more about the flu.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is a new strain of pandemic influenza that is different from the seasonal flu. People have no natural immunity to protect against this virus. The H1N1 flu virus emerged in April 2009 and surveillance of its spread shows that it is affecting more young and healthy people than the regular seasonal flu, which normally affects seniors and young children. People with underlying medical conditions, and pregnant women, may be at a greater risk for severe illness.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus -- also known as human swine influenza -- is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs. This virus usually affects pigs, but has been transferred to humans.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus has caused primarily mild illness in Canada, but Canadians need to be prepared to respond to a potentially more severe form of the virus that may emerge this fall.</p>
<p>How is it spread?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is contagious and is spread the same way as regular seasonal influenza. This happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes and their germs enter the nose, eyes, or throat of another person. The germs can also rest on hard surfaces like counters and doorknobs, and can be picked up on hands and transmitted to the respiratory system when someone touches his mouth and/or nose. It is not possible to catch it by eating pork or pork products or through blood transfusions.</p>
<p>Contagiousness</p>
<p>More research is being done on how long a person can be infectious (be able to spread the virus to others), but it is believed that this period is for one day before the onset of symptoms and continues for approximately seven days after symptoms have started. The time it takes between being infected and experiencing symptoms is between two and seven days.</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>- Almost always</p>
<p>Cough and fever</p>
<p>- Common</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle aches</p>
<p>Sore throat</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>Decreased appetite</p>
<p>Runny nose</p>
<p>- Sometimes</p>
<p>Nausea</p>
<p>Vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>- Wash hands often.</p>
<p>- Keep common surfaces disinfected.</p>
<p>- Cough and sneeze into your arm, instead of into your hand.</p>
<p>- If you are sick, stay home until your symptoms are gone and you feel well enough to participate in all activities.</p>
<p>- If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant, have underlying health problems, or if your symptoms get worse, contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant or have underlying health problems contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are otherwise healthy, you should stay home to recover. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience difficulty breathing or serious shortness of breath, it is important to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Antivirals are drugs used for the early treatment of influenza. If taken shortly after getting sick (within 48 hours), they can reduce influenza symptoms, shorten the length of illness and potentially reduce the serious complications of influenza. Antivirals do not prevent you from getting sick.</p>
<p>Canada has a National Antiviral Stockpile of 55 million doses of two antiviral drugs -- Tamiflu and Relenza. Both are effective in treating H1N1 flu virus. This stockpile is enough for all Canadians who will need and want treatment.</p>
<p>Antivirals are recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe illness, and for people at risk of severe disease. Your doctor will decide if treatment is right for you.</p>
<p>Vaccination</p>
<p>Influenza vaccines (also called flu shots) help you to prevent getting sick by introducing your body to a weakened or dead version of the virus to teach your body to build immunity to it.</p>
