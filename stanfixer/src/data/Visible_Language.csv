(author)1973,friedman  daniel.,a view  introductory education in typography,design schools which deal with typography are plagued with inviable conventions  the phase out of typography as a handicraft  and an inaccessibility to the potentials of the newer  more complex  type-setting systems. typographic form is being taught in terms of outdated mechanics and popular fashions  no teaching methodology exists which will transcend the technical and stylistic and deal only with the generically perceptual or visual. some examples of a simple typography exercise are displayed and from this exercise  general observations are presented regarding simplicity and complexity  rhythmic structure  coherency  convention  unpredictability  legibility  and readability.1973,hewes  gordon winant.,an explicit formulation of the relationship between tool-using  tool-making  and the emergence of language,if man s propositional language did not begin with speech  but with a manual gesture or sign language system  a plausible model can be built in which tool making and tool using play an important part in language emergence. even in modern speaking cultures  we learn to use tools or weapons mainly by observation of their use by others  and by signs and gestures--rather than through speech. the motor and neural elements involved in manipulation of objects and in gestural communication are very similar. the fundamental visual basis of human cognition is stressed.1973,blesser  b  shillman  r  cox  c  kublinski  t  ventura  j  et al.,character recognition based on phenomenological attributes,a theoretical approach is suggested for describing upper-case letters  not in terms of physical attributes of their archetypes  but in terms of more general descriptions of their underlying representations. a method is presented for finding these general descriptions through the study of ambiguous characters. functional attributes are the describers of the underlying representations of letters. the relations between the physical attributes of the input character and the functional attributes that specify its identity are given in part by graphical context rules which incorporate the stylistic consistency within the character itself and its neighbors. the implications of our theory of characters to the areas of computerized character recognition and type design are noted. ha1973,venturi  robert  and others.,excerpt  learning from las vegas,discusses the message of modern architecture as exemplified by the las vegas strip.

(to)1973,downing  john.,is literacy acquisition easier in some languages than in others?,it is frequently asserted that the chinese logographic writing system is more difficult to learn than the english alphabetic system. this view seems to be based chiefly on the belief that the large number of chinese characters is a heavy burden on the student. but this may be a misconception for two reasons  (1) there are far more items to be learned in the english system than is generally recognized  and (2) the sheer number of characters to be learned is not in itself an important psychological factor. what is more important is the extent of redundancy in the system. numerous alternatives may conceal the nature of the written code from the beginner and cause confusion. this and other variables in the writing system may prevent the child from perceiving that writing and print are indeed visible language.1973,douglass  malcolm p.,reading between and beyond the lines,explores the rationale and the need to implement the holistic method of reading instruction. (rb)1973,douglass  malcolm p.,reading between and beyond the lines,rather than be bound by traditional assumptions about reading--e.g.  that learning to read is a difficult task for a child and counter to his natural learning processes--we should view reading holistically. a child s earliest attempts at handling visible language symbols parallel his earliest efforts to speak and to listen  and these attempts emerge naturally as a part of normal human development. we can teach reading only indirectly. our efforts should nurture the spontaneous nature of language learning and should provide the climate and opportunity for a child to write and to read in the broadest possible context--including the reading of symbols  gestures  works of art  etc. ha1973,hartley  james  timson  susan j  burnhill  peter.,research in brief  subjective preference and retrieval of information from reference materials,a report of an investigation concerned with the ease of information retriev from a printed page and its relationship to the attractiveness of the printed version concerned. the rank order of the preferences of twenty students for eight versions of a page from an imaginary good food guide was determined. the two most preferred were tested against the two least preferred versions in terms of information retrieval. marked preferences were found  but there was no significant relation between preference for a version and efficiency of information retrieval from it. it appears that the labelling of specific information by the use of markers  such as asterisks  is more efficient than adopting variants from the typographical norm. the results suggest that the present practice of selecting a specific layout on stylistic grounds may be misguided if information retrieval is crucial.1973,wright  patricia.,research in brief  understanding tabular displays,a summarization of the results of several investigations into both logic and the display aspects of different tabulation schemes. these experimental studies show that people find some tabulation logics difficult to understand  particularly if the user of the table is required to carry out operations in addition to searching for items of information. such complex tabulation schemes have been found to markedly reduce the size of the population of competent users  it is therefore evident that tabulation schemes requiring synthetic or analytic operations on the part of the user achieve economy of space at the cost of comprehension. this was found to be true both of two-dimensional matrices and tables involving simple arithmetic. one of the necessary prerequisities for the successful use of matrix formats is the user s familiarity with the relevant dimensions of the problem he is trying to solve  rather than his familiarity with the table itself. when information about the outcomes of complex conjunctive and disjunctive contingencies must be presented  the use of a flow chart  or logical tree  can often be more effective than other ways of presenting the same information. but when such information must be committed to memory  this is more easily achieved with formats such as lists of short sentences. list structures are also common in numerical (conversion) tables giving the relation between pairs of items. aa1973,kindersley  david.,space craft,the proper fit  or spacing of letters  has been next to impossible using the type-bearing metal rectangular forms required by typographic engineering  rather  it has required the letter-by-letter attention of an artist letterer. the advent of film composition and computer technology makes possible again the proper coordination of spacing and design of letter forms. in typography  space and letter are one. optically adjusted text spacing will require attention to the subtleties of each letter s optical center and the inner forces involved in our eye s perception of these letterforms. an optical letter spacer is described  and its application for reading research is discussed. ha1973,conway  patricia.,subway graffiti in new york city,a discussion (excerpted from an earlier article in print  vol. 27  1973.)  of the current new york city trend of ghetto teenagers spraypainting subway cars and walls with their personal logos and motifs. public reaction is noted and analyzed  and the graffiti-ists  motives are considered. r. kidd1973,cushman  donald r.,the cue summation theory tested with meaningful verbal information,concludes that combined audiovisual presentations were significantly superior to either audio or visual presentations of information  thus confirming the validity of the cue summation theory. (rb)1973,cushman  donald r.,the cue summation theory tested with meaningful verbal information,no previous studies pertaining to hartman s cue summation theory (redundant information simultaneously presented by the audio and the visual channels results in greater efficiency in learning than does the same information in either channel alone.) could be found which utilized meaningful verbal information as stimulus material. students were presented material fitting this criterion and were tested for affective responses and cognitive recall. comparisons of results were made between three separate presentation procedures  audio alone  visual alone  and combined audiovisual. comparisons of affective responses did not indicate significant differences  but analyses of cognitive data demonstrated the combined audiovisual treatment resulting in half the number of errors as either the audio or the visual treatments alone. ha1973,timko  henry g.,the discrimination of three types of graphic stimuli,forty four year olds and 40 six year olds were tested on a matching-to-sample discrimination task to determine the relationship between social class status and the visual perception of graphic stimuli--matched according to critical feature transformations. english letters  letter-like forms  and line drawings of faces with embedded letters were equally divided into two confusability levels and three task levels. analysis of variance on error scores revealed differences between age groups  stimulus types  confusability levels  and task levels. social class differences were observed on highly confusable english letters among six year olds  but not among the four year olds. no significant age by social class differences were found on letter-like forms or faces.1973,barber  e j w.,the formal economy of written signs,those portions of a sign s shape which are distinctive  yet in themselves valueless  can be viewed as forming a system. such systems have ranged historically from the very loose to the very tight. when the possibilities of arranging these elements are also considered  the great range in economy of design becomes even more apparent. our own roman script  in fact  is rather inefficient in these terms  morse code  on the other hand  is quite efficient  though not perfect. it might prove useful to develop other scripts based on these principles of internal economy. but economy of form is not the same as efficiency of use  it is merely one possible component of efficiency  and must be carefully distinguished as such.1973,pollak  michael.,the prophetess deborah and the invention of printing,a colophon in one of the earliest dated imprints in the hebrew language (1475) extols the mystery and power of the newly invented printing press. seemingly unnoticed by printing and bibliographical scholars working outside the area of hebraica  the colophon is translated into english and its poetic compositin discussed. ha1973,harary  frank.,typographs,typographs are defined as graphs derived from letters. a method for classification of letters by their underlying graphic structure is illustrated. a classification of the upper-case roman letters is presented  and tables of typographs are compiled as well for the roman numerals and the lower-case script letters. the possibility of devising new alphabets is mentioned. ha1973,hoffmann  william e.,vision  sign  and inference,suggests a connection between the perceptual world taken as a system of signs and the system of signs we normally think of as visible language and defends this thesis. (to)1973,hoffmann  william e.,vision  sign  and inference,the thesis that perceiving--and by implication  vision--is inferential or semiotic is defended. whenever a person sees an object  that object s stimulation of the perceiver functions as a sign that is interpreted in the conscious response of the perceiver  the stimulation functions as a premise from which the perceiver infers a conclusion which is a conscious response. the argument has two basic steps. first  that perception is a three-termed relationship between the object perceived  a mediating element  and a conscious response  certain facts about how we perceive with the minor senses are taken into account  and cases of identical stimuli resulting in different responses are suggested as evidence that perception is mediated. secondly  this mediating element takes the form of a sign which is interpreted by the conscious response  or a set of premises for which the conscious response is a conclusion  some of charles sanders peirce s ideas about perception and signs are developed--especially his concept of a percept and a perceptual judgment  and his classification of signs. there is an important similarity between the perceptual world taken as a system of signs  and the system of signs ordinarily though of as visible language. just as one learns to read  one learns to perceive. ha1974,shillman  r  cox  c  kuklinski  t  ventura  j  eden  m  et al.,a bibliography in character recognition  techniques for describing characters,a bibliography of publications in the field of character recognition. many of the references are from the fields of engineering and psychology and deal with various techniques for describing machine and hand-printed characters. the listings are divided into five categories with sublistings  (1) general references and review papers  (2) engineering descriptions of characters  (3) psychological descriptions  (4) insight through the study of character formation  and (5) relevant journals. no annotations are included. modified ha1974,crouwel  wim.,a proposition for education in letterforms and handwriting,education should provide the means to find a personal form of expression through letterforms  it should not be restricted to an established system for copying existing styles. a new starting point for creating letterforms (as well as for design in general)--based on a system of regular pattern in the widest sense--would create a system allowing the greatest freedom and flexibility. utility and self-expression are equally important in teaching a child to write--and  at the same time  to recognize patterns and the basic rules of form and shape. ha1974,herrick  earl m.,a taxonomy of alphabets and scripts,a taxonomy or system of classification if set forth to describe alphabets and to indicate the various degrees of formal similarity which they bear to one another. the principles of this taxonomy  largely borrowed from the biological sciences  are briefly stated  three taxonomic levels  corresponding to three degrees of similarity  are then defined. for each level  the kinds and degrees of similarity which alphabets must have to be included within one taxon are described  these similarities are illustrated by several different taxa and some of the alphabets which belong to them. several problems in the comparison of writing systems which will require further research are considered. ha1974,herrick  earl m.,a taxonomy of alphabets and scripts,describes a system of classification to describe alphabets and to show the various degrees of formal similarity which they bear to one another. (to)1974,beiman  abbie w.,concrete poetry  a study in metaphor,various characteristics of concrete poetry have been examined but little attention has been focused on this art form s contribution to literature. indeed  the concrete poem exemplifies a dramatic variation in the most basic element of poetry  figurative language. traditionally  figurative language has established a relationship between the tangible objects around man and the intangibles which he seeks to know. the most common form of such figurative yokings has been the metaphor  a trope that creates a tension between the similarities and dissimilarities of the juxtaposed elements. with concrete poetry the focus of that trope is no longer just the abstract and spiritual leg of the metaphor  but the sensory perception of the literal and concrete as well. ha1974,reineck  gay beste.,design in brief  word forms,because we are continually surrounded by words  sounds  and images  our perception often becomes dulled and linear. perhaps our perceptual capabilities need and enjoy the surprise stimulation of an unexpected visual statement. words  as symbols  possess the power to evoke the meanings that they signify  when treated as visual statements their form goes beyond language  creating a deeper feeling of the word. graphic designers working in the field of visual communication are confronted with problems that cover a wide variety of subjects  content matter  and message  which nearly always contain words--sometimes a single word  sometimes a group of words. the meaning and interpretation of a word or group of words is explored  and from this exploration  a strong visual statement that clothes the word words is developed  transmitting directly their content. this exploration  which is a synthesis of words into visual forms  is an approach toward a more visual interpretation of language. ha1974,lettieri  larry.,excerpt  which computer printer when?,the computer printer has become an indispensable part of the data processing operation. there are two basic types of printer  the impact printer and the non-impact type. within each category several types are considered. basically in the impact printer category  be it a serial  dot matrix chain  or drum printer  the common feature is that an impact is used either to bring the paper to the character or the character to the paper. in the non-impact field there are several techniques. there is the electrostatic type in which an electrostatic pattern is transferred to the paper and which  consequently attracts the particles of ink  thereby forming an image. similarily  the magnetic non-impact printer uses magnetically affected particles on a belt. the belt  after being treated by a colored toner  is fused to paper  thus producing the image. heat is used on heat sensitive paper in the thermal printer  and the ink jet process uses a charged stream of ink drops which are deflected by electrostatic plates onto special papers which catch the image. the advantages of the non-impact printers are twofold  they are silent and faster  approaching 5000 lines per min  but the paper is costly. the impact type are cleaner and less expensive  but they remain slower with upper speeds approaching 1000 lines per min. p. rodriguez1974,gray  nicolete.,lettering and society,in lettering education both the application of geometric principles and the study of the past are important. (hod)1974,gray  nicolete.,lettering and society,lettering is omnipresent in our daily lives and takes a great variety of forms  it involves two different types of reading behavior  private and voluntary  public and involuntary. there is little physical similarity between the two. thought of as a medium  the physical qualities of lettering--color  form  and dimension--regain importance. lettering can transmit not only the meaning of the words but also an attitude toward those words. criteria for which public lettering should be judged are presented. socially  public lettering should enrich our environment through creative variety of all appropriate letter styles. in lettering education  both the application of geometric principles and the study of the past are important. the past can provide models  ideas  and inspiration toward the many directions lettering can be extended  no legible letter is obsolete. ha1974,bormuth  john r.,literacy policy and the emerging technology of readability,outlines some of the arguments that favor accelerating the development of the technology of readability in developing nations. (rb)1974,bormuth  john r.,literacy policy and the emerging technology of readability,the procedures for predicting and adjusting the comprehensibility of printed prose have steadily progressed from the status of an art  through that of a quasi-science  and are now emerging as a scientific technology having considerable generality and precision. of special interest is the fact that this body of knowledge has much potential for enhancing the effectiveness of a nation s efforts to achieve a desirable level of literacy in its population while  at the same time  reducing the costs of those efforts. some of the arguments that favor accelerating the development of this technology in the developed nations and the founding of the technology in the native languages of developing nations are outlined. ha1974,clay  marie m.,orientation to the spatial characteristics of the open book,one of the first code-breaking activities for the beginning reader concerns the arbitrary conventions of how books are presented. the orientation to the spatial characteristics of visible language was observed in four five year old identical girls through the developmental progression of their hand behavior while reading. preliminary theoretical explanations are offered in terms of bilateral nervous systems  handedness and reading  and perceptual strategies of visual analysis of stimuli. ha1974,barganz  robert a.,phonological and orthographic relationships to reading performance,a report of a study that investigated the use of an intermediate level of orthographic representation based upon the theoretical framework of transformational generative grammar. a general objective was to determine whether a system of semantic correspondence was utilized when irrelevant phonetic aspects of orthography were encountered by good and poor readers from a fifth grade population. a 2*2*4 factorial design was employed to investigate the effects of reading ability (good and poor)  word reality (real and pseudo)  and mode of presentation for stimuli and response items (oral and written). good readers performed better than poor readers at a statistically significant level (p .0005) on those tasks which required recognizing regularities on a deep level. when regularities were recognized on a surface level  these differences between good and poor readers diminished. good readers appeared to display a search technique which abandons a simpler level of correspondence in favor of one more efficient  one which precludes grapheme phoneme correspondences for one directed toward semantic correspondence. ha1974,barganz  robert a.,phonological and orthographic relationships to reading performance,investigated the use of an intermediate level of orthographic representation based upon the theoretical framework of transformational-generative grammar.

& systematically -- though perhaps unconsciously -- teach slower students that they are unqualified for occupations requiring educational excellence. it is suggested that programs be structured to attract illiterates to special classes by discovering their needs & aspirations  & then that methods be taught for accomplishing goals -- not just basic skills in reading  writing  & expression -- that provide the student with a sense of self-reliance & personal power. without a redefinition of priorities  educators will continue to produce dependent objects rather than agents confident of their abilities. 5 references. w. adams1982,green  maxine.,literacy for what?,literacy teaching should see learning as an action rather than a behavior. the learner must be taught that every

graphic product & in how they used drawing & writing terminology referentially across production modes. on the basis of these patterns  inferences were made about written lang development. learning to write was portrayed as a process of gradually differentiating & consolidating the separate meanings of these two forms of graphic symbolism - drawing & writing. 8 figures  21 references.

subject has had a secure place in the us common school curriculum from colonial times to the present  in large part because of social perceptions of the importance of correct spelling. spelling instruction thus provides a useful service as a record of curriculum construction in the us. once linked directly with reading instruction  nineteenth-century spelling instruction emerged as a subject taught apart from other related lang areas. through much of the present century  the spelling curriculum was shaped by beliefs that eng orthography was not systematic & that instruction should emphasize the memorization of needed words. these beliefs were complemented by attempts to apply scientific methods to curriculum development. insights gained over the past 25 years into the structure of eng orthography & the development of spelling ability have challenged these traditional views. spelling development is now widely regarded as fundamentally related to learning about the nature & functions of written lang generally. these insights present significant implications for the content & methodologies of spelling instruction. 6 figures  42 references. aa1987,crawford

progress during the 1973-74  1978-79  & 1983-84 school years. the findings are based on student responses to writing exercises which were administered to nationally representative samples of nine-year-old students. three types of writing exercises were given to the students - persuasive  imaginative  & informative. the responses to these exercises were scored using two methods  primary trait scoring (task accomplishment)  & holistic scoring (fluency). five levels of proficiency were defined for primary trait scoring  unratable  unsatisfactory  minimal  adequate  & elaborated. the holistic scoring was based on seven levels of proficiency including one for blank or unratable papers. the results were reported for each type of writing by the % of students at each level of task accomplishment & at each level of fluency. performance on task accomplishment for persuasive writing decreased slightly from 1974 to 1984 & was accompanied by a parallel & significant drop in overall fluency. in imaginative writing  the students showed an improvement in both task accomplishment & overall fluency. improvement in informative writing was marginal. results for black  hispanic  & white

fact of life. insofar as such occurrences are a matter of choice  they reflect  not linguistic poverty  but the performative bilingualism of the speaker. the visual effect of the insertion of eng forms into written franco-acadian discourse is determined by the way in which they are formally incorporated into the discourse - syntactic  morphological  & orthographic adaptation. the aesthetic effect of this visual bilingualism is determined additionally by the way in which the eng forms are used. a descriptive analysis of data from a published collection of letters-to-the-editor (1895-98) is the basis for a classification of spelling tricks used to make an eng word look or sound french  the combinatory tricks used to make a word seem french  & the adaptation of eng forms to delimit the speaker roles. further evidence from modern written monologues & dialogues is provided. when the discourse act in question has an aesthetic function  the writer s treatment of anglicisms becomes a tool in his or her creative bag of tricks  & a factor in the coherence of the text. aa1987,monaghan  e j.,readers writing   the curriculum of the writing schools of eighteenth century boston in then

of 12 categories such as grammar  letter writing  or narrative & expository writing. generally speaking  the results of trend analysis indicate an increased emphasis on oral lang tasks throughout the period  with a concomitant decrease in the amount of time spent on writing tasks. moreover  it is clear that current enthusiasm for the idea of writing-as-process has antecedents in earlier textbooks

(sr)1994,mermoz  gÃ©rard.,masks on hire  in search of typographic histories,argues that  given the functional relationship between typography and language  histories of typography must be informed by a knowledge of language-related disciplines  including linguistics  semiotics  literary theory  art history and philosophy  and also of the wider social and cultural conditions that have influenced the development of typography. the author argues that recent histories of typography promulgate orthodoxies  established canons and dogmas regarding the development of typography using the traditional linear approach of history which precludes recognition of cultural  aesthetic and semiological specificity. he calls for a more critical literature of typography which recognizes the pluralistic nature of typographic practices and their historical specificity  and in which the accepted canons and ideological frameworks are put aside. recognizing that the models of history currently available may be inadequate for such an approach  the author suggests the adoption of the structures and methods of computer-based hypertext and multimedia presentations.1994,mermoz  geard.,masks on hire  in search of typographic histories,recent polemics on typography highlight the reluctance of historians & critics to evaluate typographic differences in terms of cultural  aesthetic  & semiological specificity. the low level of theorizing characteristic of typographic histories perpetuates oversimplified views about the relation between typography & language  the role of typography as a public service  & the place & function of style in graphic communication. a theoretical decentering would underline the notion that no one should attempt to write typographic histories without a sound knowledge of disciplines influencing typography & language  ie  linguistics  literary theory  art history  bibliography  philosophy  & semiotics. 2 figures. adapted from the source document1994,mermoz  gerard.,masks on hire  in search of typographic histories.,argues that  given the functional relation between typography and language  histories of typography must be informed by those disciplines which bear upon language and its manifestations. suggests that failing this  chronicles of natural  untheorized objects will continue to assume the role and claim the status of history-writing.

(sr)1994,bush  anne.,through the looking glass  territories of the historiographic gaze,an examination of the relationship between modes of authorial perspective & the writing of graphic design histories. visual perspectives are used as an analogy to discuss two historiographic methods commonly used in constructing graphic design histories  history as storytelling (renaissance  linear perspective) & history as artifactual analysis (northern european  descriptive perspective). discursive historiography (baroque  reflexive perspective) is suggested as an alternative  where historical writing is accepted as a momentarily suspended exchange between a construction in the present & events in the past. as temporal positions  these are always in flux  thus denying any singular  absolute  history of graphic design. adapted from the source document1994,bush  anne.,through the looking glass  territories of the historiographic gaze,discusses the three distinct modes of vision at work in the early modern period  identified by the historian martin jay in his essay `scopic regimes of modernity  (1992)  to explain the different subject object juxtapositions that operate in the writing of history. the author draws a parallel between jay s `external gaze  and traditional narrative history  his `internal gaze  and the objective orientation of a positivist historian and his `reflected gaze   where the subject object positions have a reciprocity that renders them ambiguous. she considers the attributes of a discursive history according to the theories of french philosopher michel foucault (1926-84) in relation to graphic design history  and proposes a fourth approach to history  one in which the subject object juxtapositions are used as a way of acknowledging that history reflects the historian s subjective representation of the past from a present perspective  as well as the historical specificity of events.1994,bush  anne.,through the looking glass  territories of the historiographic gaze.,introduces the subject object juxtapositions inherent in the writing of history. compares these perspectives with subject object positions in the visual arts to present not only a background to current historiographic models  but to also suggest ways to extend beyond traditional historical method.

(sr)1995,rapaport  herman.,donald kuspit  an interview (television and the unconscious).,proposes that television is an inherently disintegrative technology that involves a certain self-hypnosis by the viewer. argues that the image as a totalizing field has the authority of the real behind it  which dictates something to the viewer to structure unconscious perception. elaborates how this dictation from without is inscribed into the narcissistic relation with the televised scene. (sr)1995,williamson  jack.,embodiments of human identity  detecting and interpreting hidden narratives in twentieth-century design history,argues that new ways of analysing visual forms and their chronological development can be beneficial to design history. as an example  the author explains how the theory of the development of human identity proposed by educator and polymath rudolf steiner (1861-1925) can be applied to histories of art and design. steiner s theory divides the human body into three parts that correspond to  and to an extent control  the mental drives of willing  feeling and thinking. the author explains how european avant-garde art in the first half of the 20th century and american technological design in the 1930s and 1940s can be understood to parallel  in the first case the role of thinking and willing  and in the second case that of feeling in the development of human identity. he argues that historical circumstances can to a large extent govern which drive is dominant at a given time and concludes that  in design history  period style conveys significant meaning  and chronology is important.1995,williamson  jack.,embodiments of human identity  detecting and interpreting hidden narratives in twentieth-century design history.,argues that the practice and influence of design history can benefit from new forms of visual and chronological analysis. identifies and discusses a unique phenomenon  the historical visual narrative. examines special instances of this phenomenon in twentieth-century design and visual culture  which are tied to the theme of the embodiment of human identity.

(sr)1995,gonzalez  manuel.,interview with j. s. g. boggs,in interview  the american artist j. s. g. boggs discusses his ongoing persecution by the united states secret service since he returned to the u.s.a. from australia in 1990  and their current prosecution of him for producing art work in the likeness of american banknotes. boggs creates works of art that are the same size as  and use the same colours and visual typographical conventions of  paper currency. he agrees that he is technically in breach of american law  which prohibits the production of colour works that are the same size as american banknotes  but feels that he is being wrongly prosecuted. he states that he has always been open with the united states secret service about his work  and has never attempted to pass his work off as real money. he describes and expresses his anger at their repeated raids on his studio and on exhibitions in which he has participated. he claims that depictions of currency are widespread in art from the 14th century to the present  and defines his work as attempting to query and replicate the nature of the financial transaction. he asserts that he is not a counterfeiter and that he is committed to making real art in his chosen mÃ©tier.1995,smith  sandra.,j. s. g. boggs  life size and in colour,describes the experiences of the american artist j. s. g. boggs since 1984  when he began to produce works of art that are the same size as and use the same colours and visual and typographical conventions of paper currency. he `spends  his art by swapping it for services. he is not a counterfeiter  and his art could not easily be mistaken for banknotes  but he was prosecuted for counterfeiting in britain in 1986-87 and in australia in 1989  and acquitted both times. during the 1986-87 prosecution  the british authorities confiscated seven works that resemble american banknotes and requested the assistance of the united states secret service. they refused  and insisted instead that the british authorities return the confiscated works to boggs. however  since returning to the u.s.a. in 1990  the united states secret service has also launched a prosecution against boggs  using the seven bills that were at issue in britain as evidence. whilst boggs is in breach of american law  which prohibits the production of colour works that are the same size as american banknotes  he intends to take his case to the supreme court to establish his rights under the first and fifth amendments.1995,zurbrugg  nicholas  jameson  fredric.,jameson s complaint  video-art and the intertextual `time-wall ,challenges fredric jameson s critique of video art `reading without interpretation  post-modernism and the video text   published in postmodernism or the cultural logic of late capitalism (manchester  england  manchester university press  1987). the author summarizes jameson s objections to video  central to which is his view that it is a superficial medium that cannot make a lasting impression on the memory  and highlights his hostility towards post-modernism. he refutes the main points of jameson s arguments and cites the work of artists including nam june paik  charlotte moorman and robert wilson to demonstrate that video art is a powerful medium that can stimulate thought and encourage self-analysis and cultural critique. he suggests that jameson belongs to a generation whose training has not prepared them for understanding new visual media  who are hostile to post-modern cultural forms because they cannot perceive the new discursive spaces they open up and because post-modernism itself challenges the principles of modernism on which their understanding of art is based.1995,zurbrugg  nicholas.,jameson s complaint  video-art and the intertextual time-wall.,responds to fredric jameson s 1987 article reading without interpretation  postmodernism and the videotext. argues that video art encourages self-analysis and allows for a critical examination of culture and that video art is polemical in that it creates strategies whereby the viewers are disoriented and required to think about their own processes of perception and cognition. (sr)1995,rapaport  herman.,liminal eye,explores the implications of german-born painter hans breder s idea that the surface of a painting should be thought of as part of the eye itself  as a membrane of visible excitation closely linked to vision itself. this conception of the nature of the surface of a painting  which breder explores in his 1993 series of paintings liminal icon  thus involves vision becoming an inextricable part of the work of art and icons used in art also become a part of the eye. the author considers the implications of this concept for an understanding of the nature of the work of art and the process by which it discloses its meaning  and also for readings of works that have erotic content and of abstract expressionist works that have no representational intentions. he examines how this theory could be extended to video art and argues that video is a medium well-suited to an examination and deconstruction of media-constructed icons of the type suggested by the idea.1995,kostelanetz  richard.,literary video,new york-based video artist and writer richard kostelanetz discusses the genre of the literary video and describes his work in this genre. he explains the differences between his genre and other more established video genres that use text  such as literary-reportage. in literary video  the text is integrated into the visual imagery physically in different ways that bring the textual and visual elements of the work into new relationships with each other. kostelanetz outlines the potential for literary video to transcend the syntactical and narrative structures that govern conventional literature and the constraints relating to subject  theme and truth placed on broadcast television. he explores the suitability of video for literary experimentation  describing video as a private and personal medium that is closer to the book than either television or cinema and details two of his literary video works -three prose pieces (1975) and openings and closings (1975) to illustrate the different techniques that can be used to integrate literary content with visual image.1995,kostelanetz  richard.,literary video.,discusses literary video as a genre in which text and image are brought together  not kept separate as in broadcast television. argues that the fact that video can distort images much more radically than film means that the merger of text and image promotes a more extensive exploration of visible language than possible in any other media. (sr)1995,zurbrugg  nicholas.,nam june paik  an interview,in interview  korean-born video artist nam june paik (b.1932) discusses his work and career as a pioneering video artist since the 1960s  the influence of his work and of video art in general on related media  including commercial television  and the use of video as a medium in contemporary art. paik outlines his involvement with fluxus in germany in the 1960s  its aims and successes and its influence on his early interest in new media which led to his video work. he focuses on the influence of german artist joseph beuys (1921-86) and describes works he created in collaboration with him. he explains the importance of collaboration to him and describes some of the projects he has worked on with other artists  including john cage  merce cunningham and laurie anderson. he comments on trends in contemporary video art and multimedia technologies  and examines his belief in the potential for humanizing technology through art.1995,zurbrugg  nicholas.,nam june paik  an interview.,presents an interview with nam june paik  a seminal figure in video art  who candidly discusses his working processes and values. offers his comments on such diverse problems as technology  cost  collaboration  mtv  and the artist s ego. discusses also the values and the artists associated with the artistic movement fluxus. (sr)1995,butler  frances.,new demotic typography  the search for new indices,discusses a trend in typographical design in the last 15 years which has seen the revival of early visual indicators and approaches to punctuation and layout  which the author defines as `demotic  - a popular form of visual communication dating from pre-literate societies. she explains this trend as the result of changes in the way in which information is obtained  resulting primarily from the proliferation of computer information databases that presuppose lateral rather than linear ways of thinking. she describes examples of typographical design that uses this new demotic type  identifying the layering of text and image  the obscuring of the surface  the use of old and new letterforms and type and script in text elements  and  in certain media  the rendering of text in ways that suggest sound  as its main features. she considers the distinction made by art historian alois riegl (1858-1905) between haptic and optic modes - the former relates to touch  the latter to sight - and how  in her opinion  the new demotic type combines the two modes. she places her discussion in the context of the ongoing debate on legibility.1995,butler  frances.,new demotic typography  the search for new indices.,sees new demotic typography as the reinvention of many older punctuation devices in terms of marginal reuse. argues that it can represent the fluid fields of type and image that will induce reverie  often a precondition for metaphoric  nonlinear thought  thus helping to fuse widely separated information and aid lateral thinking. (sr)1995,shell  marc.,paper  gold and art as representation and exchange,analyses early resistance to the introduction of paper currency in the u.s.a. in the 19th century  explaining such resistance to the notion that worthless paper could be used as a symbol for valuable gold in terms of prevailing economic theory  but also in terms of aesthetic resistance to the representative power of paper. the author considers works produced by marcel duchamp  daniel spoerri and donald judd in which they not only replicated the bills and cheques commonly used as instruments for financial transaction  but also replicated and questioned the financial transaction itself by proffering their art in return for services. in each case  their signature conferred the required value on the art work. with reference to these works  the author summarizes art critical thinking on the potential for art as capital and outlines the views of marx on the fetishistic and spiritual qualities of economic exchange in judaeo-christian history.1995,rapaport  herman.,television and the unconscious - donald kuspit  an interview,in interview  the american art critic donald kuspit discusses the nature of television as a medium and art form. he explains his theory that the physical nature of television and the technical process by which it produces images as an iconic mosaic within a vibrating luminous field induces a certain type of response in the viewer that undermines its usefulness as a means of stimulating thought. the viewer absorbs and internalizes the images television broadcasts at an unconscious level as part of a psychological process of narcissistic completion that infantilizes the viewer. he considers whether video art can overcome this process to produce works that operate at a different level of consciousness  and suggests criteria for judging video art with this in mind. however  he concludes that video art lacks a necessary mediating process between the art work and the viewer  contrasting it in this respect with theatre  cinema and literature  and has ultimately as its goal the very narcissistic completion that he identifies as the major disadvantage of the medium.1995,rapaport  herman.,the liminal eye.,discusses interrelations between painting and video art. argues that once the surface of the painting is thought of in relation to the membrane of the eye as if the painting s surface were part of the eye itself  the painting s surface would have to be thought of as a membrane of visible excitation that is hard to separate from vision. (sr)1995,breder  hans  rapaport  herman.,the luminous object  video art and theory,introduces this issue  which consists of an anthology of essays and interviews with video artists and art critics and provides a survey of different approaches to  and art critical attitudes towards  contemporary video art. the authors explain their intention to show the current scope of video as an art medium and the impact on its potential of rapidly evolving technologies. they summarize the unique nature of video as an art medium  which resides largely in its ability to emulate and interface with other media  and discuss the ways in which video art is forcing the development of new theories of art rather than being limited by existing theories. they outline the specificity of their approach in constructing the anthology - each of the contributors has participated in the university of iowa s program in intermedia and video art  which was founded in 1968 by breder  professor of art at the university.1995,rapaport  herman.,time and light - david garcia  an interview,in interview  the video artist david garcia discusses his understanding of the nature of video art and his work in the medium. he explains his involvement with the dutch software laboratory and video art distribution organization time based art  which he co-founded in the 1980s  and his collaborations with annie wright from this time on. he explores how his attempts to use colour to embody  and not merely represent  light when working as a painter prefigured his current experiments with light in video art. he refuses to define video art  but considers the differences between it and broadcast television in terms of the issues which each media addresses and the traditions in which they operate  noting the fact that video art addresses issues relevant to the arts in particular in contrast to broadcast television. he discusses the question of what constitutes a successful video art work  suggesting that the artist s success in communicating and achieving his intentions is an important criterion. he lists video artists and works which he admires  including klaus von bruch s das propellorband (1979)  the british scratch video group  and group barber.1996,sless  david.,better information presentation  satisfying consumers?,addressing current debate on information presentation design  which is dominated by a dichotomy - which he considers false - between performative and aesthetic elements  the author suggests an approach which brings these two elements together in graphic design that can be shown to satisfy consumer needs. the approach he describes has emerged in the last decade out of research done by the communication research institute of australia  and involves a theoretical view of communication as  essentially  a form of conversation. he suggests that  by introducing a moral-aesthetic dimension into the conversation through caring about and respecting their target users and communicating this approach as part of their design  graphic designers can produce work that makes information more accessible to the end user. he outlines his method for achieving this  and cites projects on which he has worked involving the redesign along moral-aesthetic principles of forms  utility bills and medicine labels which have resulted in quantifiably more effective presentation. he concludes by stating his belief that information designers have a moral responsibility to users and to society.1996,elkins  james.,between picture and proposition  torturing paintings in wittgenstein s tractatus,art history has recently used a multidisciplinary approach in its attempt to find adequate accounts of the differences between pictures  writing  & other graphic marks. it is argued here that the ideas of ludwig wittgenstein should be applied to this research. wittgenstein s position is summarized  particularly his picture theory. its place in the tractatus logico-philosophicus is recalled  using as a reference max black s (1964) companion to wittgenstein s tractatus. black s interpretation of wittgenstein s picture theory takes the theory to refer to literal pictures  but it is argued that wittgenstein s later uses of the term seem more intuitive. the use of element by wittgenstein is also examined in light of black s opinions. the determinateness of a picture s elements is addressed  & it is considered whether black s view that some pictures are sometimes indeterminate is compatible with a literal reading of wittgenstein that says all pictures are determinate. the relationship between showing & saying is approached  with an emphasis on how picture theory works for statements. it is concluded that w. j. t. mitchell s (1986) term hypericon may be useful to the understanding of wittgenstein  which is in turn useful to contemporary visual theory. adapted from the source document1996,elkins  james.,between picture and proposition  torturing paintings in wittgenstein s tractatus,discusses the `picture theory  articulated by wittgenstein in his tractatus logico-philosophicus  suggesting that it can inform debates on contemporary visual theory  which is dominated by a problem with the definition of `picture . current debate attempts to define `picture  according to structural theories  mainly semiotic  that require an analysis of pictures in ways that give rise to polarities between word and language and image and the visual. the author argues that wittgenstein s picture theory concerns itself more with pictures - actual or mental visual images - than  as generally supposed  with propositions. however  he stretches the word `picture  to support his assertion that a statement is a picture  which is important for his argument for the logical similarities between showing and saying. the author concludes that wittgenstein offers a rigorous logical model of graphic meaning that is relevant to contemporary debates  whilst also shedding light on the nature of current difficulties with the concept of the picture.1996,elkins  james.,between picture and proposition  torturing paintings in wittgenstein s tractatus.,argues that wittgenstein s picture theory in tractatus is  contrary to widespread assumptions  actually about pictures in several important senses  and that it offers a more rigorous and logical model of graphic meaning than many later theories.

images and text - and mexico now found in culture throughout the u.s.a.2000,wilkerson  kyoko takashi  wilkerson  douglas.,the gloss as poetics  transcending the didactic,this article examines recent creative uses of the interlinear gloss  or furigana  in japanese writing. traditionally used simply to supply pronunciations for chinese characters  the examples collected & analyzed here make use of several different non-standard script combinations & provide poetic tropes or subtle alterations of the glossed text. the unique simultaneity of the relationship between gloss & glossed word  the manipulation of symbolic associations of the various notational systems employed in japanese  & creation of distinctive visual patterns lend support to arguments for the autonomy of the written word. 3 figures. adapted from the source document2000,shep  sydney.,the restaurant at this end of the universe  edible typography in new zealand,discusses aspects of the relationship between food  language and visual consumption  as evidenced in the labels  packaging and advertisements designed for food since the 1950s. with reference to the book alice in wonderland  the author identifies the importance of labelling as a means of communicating information about edible products and their properties. he discusses related practices involving the embedding of typography in the surface of foods for religious or educational purposes and the development out of this of a tradition of baking words into biscuits which finds parallels in the recent development of small sticky labels for fruit. he positions these practices as illustrating the complex relationship between the consumption of food and the acquisition of knowledge. tracing the development of detachable packaging for fruit and biscuits following the advent of the corporate logo  the author explains how detachable packaging destabilizes this association between food and knowledge and creates a conceptual space where marketing can operate to stimulate desire. he concludes by considering the large-scale advertisements for foodstuffs common in new zealand in this context of the market s stimulation of desire using inedible representations of edible foodstuffs.2000,shep  sydney j.,the restaurant at this end of the universe  edible typography in new zealand,the use of typography with certain food products is investigated to better understand the connection between food consumption & knowledge. although the relationship between language & food products has been addressed in literature  eg  lewis carroll s alice in wonderland  it is asserted that the placement of typography on foodstuffs has been largely disregarded. it is contended that the embossment of typography on food products has historically served different functions  eg  a reward for knowledge acquisition & a rhetorical strategy used to increase consumption. an analysis of the use of typography on food products is then performed  emphasizing the marketing advantages stamping language onto foodstuffs presents & the advancements in the presentation & packaging of food products. the replacement of embossed typography on foodstuffs with large technicolor representations of food products in advertisements or billboards is then discussed. the implications of the changing nature of media used to advertise food products are also considered. 34 references. j. w. parker2000,seki  yusaku.,using lists to improve text access  the role of layout in reading,this paper describes two experiments that explore the effects of different ways of presenting a list in text on readers recall & reading processes. in the first experiment  participants read one of four styles of a list & then were asked to recall the content. the results showed that recall for the separately arranged lists was better than that for the continuously arranged lists & that there was a difference in reading patterns between the two layouts. the second experiment examined individual reading processes for both separated & continuous layouts with the text presented by computer. it was found that the separated list allowed readers to reread the points selectively  while the continuous list made readers reread the text sequentially. consequently  readers of the separated list understood the content faster than did those of the continuous list. these findings indicate that the layout of a list affects the way that it is read & understood. 4 tables  2 figures  12 references. adapted from the source document2000,seki  yusaku.,using lists to improve text access  the role of layout in reading.,finds layout of a list affects the way it is read and understood  recall for separately arranged lists in text was better than that for continuously arranged lists  and notes a difference in reading patterns between the two layouts  and a separated list allowed readers to reread the points selectively  while a continuous list made readers reread the text sequentially. (sr)2000,hitchcock  lucinda.,word space book space poetic space  experiments in transformation,the american artist lucinda hitchcock describes a series of seven 2- and 3-dimensional experimental projects constructed to explore the relationship between words and letters  the effect of context on how their meaning is perceived  and their existence in a material sense within a physical environment. she describes each of her experimental projects in turn to illustrate different aspects of the existence of words and letters as material within three dimensions. the first concerns the workings of the letter press and its use to create a text out of physical elements organized in space. the second involved reorganizing the material within a copy of the book the life and opinions of tristram shandy into a trampoline-like sheet. for her third she recreated the golden section in a private garden space using tulips  while for the fourth she placed text from italo calvino s novel if on a winter s night a traveller along the spines of books specially bound for the purpose. the fifth and sixth projects involved setting her design students tasks - the first  the creation of a narrative in words around an everyday object given to them by the author  and the creation of a new artefact inspired by that narrative  the second the creation of three-dimensional letter forms. the final project is still in the planning and involves floating words and letters down the providence river.2001,frascara  jorge.,diagramming as a way of thinking ecologically,considers the use of diagrams as a means of organizing and presenting information. positioning language - the privileged method of imparting information in western educational systems - as an inadequate  linear form of communication that does not lend itself to descriptions of complicated or hierarchical structures  the author proposes the diagram as a method far more suited than language for describing what he terms `ecologies of information . he presents examples of diagrams designed to convey information relating to ecological issues where multiple factors interact  outlines the results of a classroom survey he carried out on improvements in learning and memory when diagrams are used to augment standard teaching strategies  and describes an analysis of traffic systems and road safety issues in relation to diagram-based signage systems. he argues that different models of learning involving mind-mapping strategies which encourage the integration of knowledge across fields might have evolved had diagrams been better regarded by educationalists  and concludes by calling for their adoption within mainstream teaching practices.2001,hsu  sheng-hsiung  huang  kuo-chen.,effects of minimal legible size characters on chinese word recognition,two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of minimal legible size characters on chinese word recognition. in experiment 1  the minimal legible size was determined empirically to be the character size necessary to attain 95% correct recognition for various chinese characters which differed in the number of strokes comprising the character  ranging from 3 to 27. the results showed that the minimal legible sizes were larger for characters with more strokes. this indicates that characters with more strokes should be enlarged to attain the same recognition performance as that from characters with fewer strokes. experiment 2 investigated recognition accuracy for a string of minimal legible size characters vs conventional equal size characters. the results showed that accuracy rate for the minimal legible size condition was higher than that for the conventional size condition. although chinese characters presented with their minimal legible size might change the present word configuration  the results suggest that minimal legible size of characters might help readers recognize words in situations where reading time is extremely short. in particular  the results suggest that minimal legible size chinese characters may be appropriate in the design of warning or emergency signs. 2 tables  2 figures  21 references.

not  a new term is introduced  intersign. intersign poetry does not privilege sound  but focuses on new integrative sound-vision presented by technology through digital means. technology-based poetry is traced to french experiments in the 1950s. following a brief history of poetic development  intersign poetry is contrasted with sound poetry & positioned relative to multimedia & hypermedia. the engagement of the audience is viewed as a critical component in exploring meaning & sensory development. 4 figures  13 references. adapted from the source document2001,winkler  dietmar r.,limits of language  limits of worlds,an introduction to essays in a special thematic issue provides summaries of the content of the three contributions that address limitations of expert languages  the integration of visual literacy with other literacies  & the need for cross-disciplinary discourse. the rigidity of theories is assessed in connection with challenges they present to the launching of a dialogue among the disciplines of visual graphic industrial design  computer graphics  robotics & machine vision  communication & advertising  studio arts  art education  & narrative media. information theory is expanded by multiple additions into an interdisciplinary crossover model in which noise includes political  social  & economic changes. limitations of visual discourse are exemplified by contrasting examples of the language of japanese art forms & the visual literacy of the west. 57 references. adapted from the source document2001,winkler  dietmar.,limits of language  limits of worlds,provides an introduction to the conceptual background to three essays in this issue of the journal  two of which are relevant to the scope of abm and are abstracted in this issue. the author highlights a new interdisciplinary discourse on perception and communication that supports the integration of visual literacy with the other literacies in a given culture. he discusses the separation of theory and practice in the art world  and its reluctant adaptation to scientific method  and cites the flow of the design process as an example of an interactive pragmatic model on a loose theoretical base. he comments on the essay `some things that pictures are good for  by lester loschky  which explores the limited human capacity for the retention of visual information  and considers the limitations of form in languages  with reference to japanese form taxonomy devised in 1963 by yuichiro kojiro  and its western counterpart as a visual literacy system. he concludes by explaining how jennifer gunji addresses inadequacies in the japanese form taxonomy in her essay `new media  experience and japanese way of tea (chado) .2001,gunji  jennifer.,new media  experience and japanese way of tea (chado),explains how the philosophy of the japanese `way of tea  (chado) can be applied to the teaching and learning of design in the west. the author  a graphic design educator  highlights the limitations of current design curricula at tertiary level  and outlines her proposal for an expanded concept of graphic design that takes not only rapidly advancing technology but also the breadth of human visual  sensory  emotional  and spiritual experience into account. she describes the possibility of adapting the japanese ideology and methodology of aesthetic education to the study of art and design  focuses on the correlation between the setting  process  and spiritual aspects of chado and the experience of cyberspace  and concludes by stating that dedication to such a way of study would lead far beyond art and design to encompass a way of life.2001,scholz  christian.,relations between sound poetry and visual poetry  the path from the optophonetic poem to multimedia text,the works of several 20th-century sound poets & multimedia artists are examined to demonstrate the role of visual text within sound poetry. it is contended that visual texts  when used in sound poetry & multimedia art  perform a role similar to orchestral scores that accompany dramas & films. the works of three early-20th-century sound poets - hugo ball  raoul hausmann  & kurt schwitters - are analyzed to illustrate the function of visual text in sound poetry & the importance the poets attached to the recording of their sound poems. in addition  the works of three mid- & late-20th-century poets - franz mon  carlfriedrich claus  & valeri scherstjanoi - are studied  emphasizing their employment of audio-recording technology & how visual texts were articulated in their poetry. the future implications of using computer & digital technology to compose sound poetry & create multimedia art are also considered. 8 figures. adapted from the source document2001,loschky  lester.,some things that pictures are good for   an information processing perspective,we have developed very efficient ways of dealing with these visual experience limitations. one biologically based scheme is to make rapid eye movements around our visual environment several times per second. this allows us to attend to items in our visual environment serially that we could not attend to simultaneously  and allows us to refresh our leaky visual short-term memories at the same time. a second entirely human invention is to make and view pictures. pictures have a great capacity for allowing us to direct a person s attention to things they might not have noticed. pictures also allow us the time to carefully explore visual information by attending to details that otherwise might have disappeared in our ever-changing world. likewise  because pictures can hold information in a stable form  we don t have to use our limited visual short-term memories to hold onto their contents. instead  we have the potential to repeatedly look back at any detail whenever the need arises in order to more deeply process its contents without loss of information due to the image changing. in this way  pictures facilitate our contemplation of visual information. of course  pictures do not remove the inherent limitations on our visual attention  resolution and short-term memory  as clearly shown in the pictorial demonstrations contained in this article. however  pictures do extend our abilities to deal with these limitations in ways that greatly enrich our visual experience. [publication abstract]2001,loschky  lester.,some things that pictures are good for  an information processing perspective,discusses the role of images in counteracting the limitations of the human visual experience. the author outlines the physiological  spatial  and temporal limitations of seeing  and describes two ways in which perception and cognition are improved  of which the making and using of images is quintessentially human. he cites examples of psychological research into the factors that guide the viewer s attention  such as studies centred on paintings by georges seurat and piet mondrian  and explains how rendering detail immobile can aid the operation and management of memory  with particular reference to a pair of near identical images containing objects that are respectively appropriate and unexpected to the viewer given the context. he concludes by considering whether habitual looking at images can alter one s perception of the world  and what the implications of visual limitation might be for artists `learning how to see .2001,salen  katie.,surrogate multiplicities  typography in the age of invisibility,extending an investigation made by beatrice wade in her 1932 essay `the crystal goblet  on the ways in which typography adds meaning to a text  the author explores how typography can signify cultural and social norms and exceptions to those norms. she uses wade s central metaphor of typography as a crystal goblet which invisibly enhances the thing it contains to present her argument that typography functions as a system which marks social difference. she provides examples of environmental signage  in the form of shop signs in the u.s.a.  to illustrate how typography transparently invites judgements regarding social class and ethnic and regional background. describing a move in the u.s.a. between 1880 and the 1920s towards linguistic standardization as intended to allow differentiation between established norms and the innovations of immigrants  she suggests that the impetus to standardization was driven by racial prejudice. she cites various fonts which emerged in the 1920s which indicate those prejudices in visual form  and compares them to recent fonts designed to investigate the ability to embody history and culture within typography  but which repeat the stereotypes of their precursors. she investigates the drive towards stereotyping with reference to the computer graphic tool poser  in the imagery of which she discerns sexual stereotyping  and concludes by considering strategies for circumventing typography s ability to frame subjects.2001,salen  katie.,surrogate multiplicities  typography in the age of invisibility,historically  much critical discussion  particularly among typographers  has centered on the role typographic form plays in conveying meaning. beatrice ward s image of the crystal goblet  evoked in a 1932 essay of the same name created a framework for considering how value & meaning are assigned to a text based not only on what is written  but how it was written. while ward was primarily concerned with the dynamics of letterform & legibility  this essay attempts to extend her metaphor into the realm of social difference by exploring the myriad ways that spaces of cultural inclusion & exclusion are mediated via typographic form. within such an argument  qualities of transparency & lightness attributed to the crystal goblet operate as agents of invisibility for nonstandard speakers  or a whole host of others that fall outside the normalizing boundaries of linguistic standardization supported by ward s image of an undifferentiated typographic surface. the discussion begins by tracing historical precedents for the marking of social difference through distinctions in typographic form. typefaces from jim crow to tiki magic demonstrate how the display of otherness relies on the historicizing mechanics of cultural standardization. similarly  an analysis of pictorial trademarks developed in the mid to late 19th century reveal how fractured letterforms served as the visual equivalent of the broken english of a growing immigrant population. finally  a connection is made to how contemporary software  through specified feature sets & default settings  supports a long tradition of representational standardization. 10 figures. adapted from the source document2001,zurbrugg  nicholas.,technology  polypoetry and the aura of poly-performance,presents extracts from writings by 20th century artists  poets  musicians  critics  and theorists to illustrate the extent to which the theory and practice of interdisciplinary art has revealed an interest in aurality. quotations from works by the following are included  walter benjamin  jean baudrillard  paul virilio  fillippo tommaso marinetti  the fluxus artist dick higgins  the sound poets henri chopin and enzo minarelli  the body artists stelarc and orlan  the performance artist and director robert wilson  and the filmmaker nick zedd. the author identifies central questions relating to the subject of aurality and interdisciplinary art involving new technologies  and selects quotations which address them. he states his view that cultural theory consistently neglects the influence of this interest in aurality on developments in the field of poly-performance  and positions the work of wilson  zedd  and orlan as illustrating a form of commercial `techno-poly-pop  performance which combines elements of experimental art  mass marketing  and pseudo-pornography with traditional avant-garde strategies.2001,minarelli  enzo.,the manifesto of polypoetry,several key tenets of the author s (1987) manifesto on polypoetry are revisited to determine their applicability to present-day sound poetry. the author s original contention that technological advancements will shape the future of sound poetry is strongly supported  in addition  the assertion that language must be released from its printed constraints so that its polyvalent sounds can be realized is also stressed. the use of the mouth & of digital technology in achieving vocorality  defined as the fusion of vocality & orality  is then discussed. it is then contended that sound poets must justify their utilization of time while performing sound poetry & should employ computer technology to edit their poetic works. the claims that written language can function as a corporal instrument & that the voice operates as a visible extension of poetic rhythm are seconded. it is also argued that polypoetry is the fusion of multiple artistic modes & is designed to be performed in front of a live & active audience. adapted from the source document2001,minarelli  enzo.,the singing blackbird   voice  images  technology in polypoetry,voice is the essence of polypoetry or sound poetry - the voice with its direct  organic possibilities of expression whether technologically amplified or manipulated or not. focusing on live performance  the interrelatedness of audience and poet is essential. while the voice is primary  the interaction with image is also essential. the author avoids fusion in which the identity and character of various poetic components become confused and lost.2001,polkinhorn  harry.,the sound images in experimental poetry,the role of the image in experimental poetry is examined through an exploration of poetic reference to human sensory experience. from this vantage point  true heritage differentiates sound images from visual images in poetry.2001,costa  mario.,the word of poetry  sounds of the voice and technology,the connection between music & poetry & the influence of technology on sound poetry are examined. rather than perceive music & poetry as strictly differentiated  relevant 19th & 20th century european philosophy is analyzed to demonstrate the close connection between music & poetry. nevertheless  it is stressed that the differences between the notions of musicalization & sonorization are substantial. rene ghil s (1886) abstract notion of sound poetry is subsequently discussed to better understand the emergence of a formalist perspective toward analyzing the aesthetics  especially music. the eventual incorporation of this formalist approach into the analysis of poetics during the late 19th century is noted. however  it is maintained that the invention of the telephone & the phonograph challenged this formalist perspective since such technology essentially overturned traditional understandings of music & sound. the role that aural technology  particularly the magnetophone  has played in the development of sound poetry is also discussed. j. w. parker2001,polkinhorn  harry.,true heritage  the sound image in experimental poetry,the differentiation between the human voice & technological substitutions of the voice in sound poetry is studied to determine the function of the sound image in experimental poetry. walter ong s (1967) discussion of how visual images have historically replaced aural images is deemed insufficient for understanding the sound image s role in experimental poetry. it is contended that poetic analysis must take a greater interest in examining the visual-graphic & aural aspects of poetry  not simply its printed language  in order to better understand poetry s non-verbal aspects  eg  metaphor  music  & allusion. a multifaceted strategy for using the printed language of poetry to allow examination of both pre- & non-verbal images is subsequently presented. after demonstrating the role symbols play in experimental poetry  carl jung s (no date provided) theory of collective unconscious archetypes is used to assert that sound poetry should be analyzed from a psychic  not physiological  perspective. the need to acknowledge the importance of the symbol in experimental poetry is re-emphasized. 31 references. adapted from the source document2001,zurbrugg  nicholas.,visible language  audible language  inarticulable language and the supplementary signifier,the works of 20th-century multimedia artist henri chopin & cultural theorist roland barthes are studied to better understand technology s influence on language. a discussion of chopin s (1967  1998) understanding of sound poetry & of barthes s (1977) notion of the supplementary signifier revealed several parallels in their respective thought  eg  the need to reconsider the categorization of certain cultural developments such as the distinction between poetry & composition. it is subsequently asserted that chopin s sound poetry illustrates that poetic orality predates pre-technologic language yet recognizes that such forms of poetic expression are dependent on multimedia technology to express vocality in a non-printed & non-semantic format. it is then asserted that chopin s sound poetry provides support for barthes s notion of supplementary signifiers. sound poetic approaches to language are deemed superior to those offered by surrealist perspectives since the latter adhere to basic literary notions & fail to emphasize the body. it is concluded that categorizing multimedia arts remains problematic since such artistic forms occupy multiple existing categories. 27 references. adapted from the source document2002,golec  michael.,alix lambert s `the mark of cain

an interest in design research,in the first of two special issues devoted to research in communication design  argues for the development of design research. the author highlights three factors which have contributed to sustaining and renewing interest in design research - technological influences  contextual change  and educational opportunity - and explains why designers  who have long benefited from knowledge derived from other disciplines with strong research traditions  now need to engage in research development for their own subject. she concludes by briefly introducing each of the issue s four articles  which tackle issues ranging from interactive media to typographic cueing.2002,chujit jeamsinkul  poggenpohl  sharon.,methodology for uncovering motion affordance in interactive media, interactive media allows the user to have control over navigation and interactivity with the information. the nature of interactive media is dynamic and changes through time. to support this dynamic change  knowledge of how to communicate information efficiently beyond static representation needs exploration. motion is a key element in interactive environments. motion helps the user to perceive a change of state. the characteristics and capabilities of motion demonstrate its potential benefit to interaction  but there is very little guidance available regarding when and how to use motion in interactive media. though baecker and small performed research concerning motion s utility in interface  questions still remain  how do we design such animation so that they are clear and comprehensible  attractive and appealing? how do we prevent animation from being too complex to be effective? such questions can be answered only through the extensive development of prototypes and through user testing (baecker and small  1990). by looking at motion systematically with regard to how users understand it  knowledge of how to use motion effectively in interactive media can be revealed. this paper examines the process of designing an experimental situation in which the meaning of motion can be revealed. because the experiment was executed  data is analyzed  results are discussed and further developments are identified. 2002,gonzalez de cosio  maria  dyson  mary c.,methods for manipulating electronic documents in relation to information retrieval, this study is part

2002,chayutsahakji  praima.,perspectives on building a discourse between design theory and practice,building a discourse between design theory and practice is one of the three sections of the annotated design research bibliography. theoretical knowledge is simultaneously generated and accumulated through reflective practice and judging of results. to support the partnership of practitioner-researchers and research-practitioners  thirty theory and design practice books are selected in both directions regarding how knowledge is used and accumulated  and how knowledge is built through design research. the  theory building  selection includes books on both reflective research concepts and those with reflective research examples. the  theory using  selection ranges from the broad and general use of theories in design to the more specific use of theories in different design fields and the integration of design with other disciplines. the selected books are useful for the development of design theory  design research  design practice  design intellectual culture and design discipline.

study,discusses a study entitled the mirage project which was designed to investigate reader responses to photographs accompanying newspaper articles. the author outlines his technique of offering a choice of four illustrations to each article which participants had to rank and then subsequently explain their preferences  and  based on his findings  he identifies four classes of response to photographs  a `locked  look that seeks familiar images  an `opening  look that searches for the new  a `pragmatic  look that makes connections with personal experience  and a `reflecting  look that identifies with people pictured. he emphasizes the sophistication and scope for exploration of reader response to images  downplaying distinctions between manipulated photography and reportage.2002,ingemann  bruno.,the mirage project  an experimental qualitative reception study,the mirage project focuses on how readers ascribe meaning to the pictures in the newspaper. the conventions of the newspaper as regards truthfulness  reliability & authenticity see the photograph as data  as information. but the photograph is more than that. through the project sixteen informants  reception of four different pictures are analyzed in relation to the news articles to which they belong. through the use of different visual variants for the same article the reader gets the possibility to be critical & to choose between different pictures. the mirage project gathers this chaos of readers  choices & arguments for their choices through a series of analyses. in the light of the new digital culture the reader makes a different frame of understanding than newspaper conventions normally offer. the readers are disobedient. they have other values & other demands on quality than expected. this article is a presentation of a reception project where the experimental method is developed to extend the semiotic meaning potential & partly defines the readers  values & preferences. 4  11 references. adapted from the source document2002,dyson  mary c  gregory  judy.,typographic cueing on screen, the effects of typographic cues  such as bold  underline  italic

investigates whether cueing on screen facilitates recall and introduces factors that have been explored when cueing content in printed material.  2002,dyson  mary c  gregory  judy.,typographic cueing on screen,in the first of two special issues devoted to research in communication design  reports on a case study exploring the usefulness of typographic cueing on screen. the authors consider some of the assumptions underlying typographic cueing  review the findings of research targeting printed material  and provide details of their methodology  which involved using red type to cue varied magazine material and testing whether and how it can aid the recall of specific information on a sample of 30 under- and postgraduate students in typography and graphic communication. the results did not support a general improvement in immediate recall of cued material  but indicated  among other things  that cueing incidental phrases produced better recall than cueing the whole sentence. they infer that their research found no clear evidence that these results differ from those for print  and recommend that further research be carried out into the use of cueing on screen.2002,dyson  mary c  gregory  judy.,typographic cueing on screen,this study investigates whether cueing on screen facilitates recall & introduces factors that have been explored when cueing content in printed material. a series of documents was read on screen followed by a set of multiple choice questions  which covered a range of question types. cued material was either a phrase or sentence in red type  and these related to either main facts or incidental details. a control condition contained no red. instruction regarding cueing was also varied. we found a difference in overall recall between the cueing conditions  but no significant difference between the experimental conditions & the control. the difference was attributable to better recall of cued phrases than cued sentences. however  this difference was found only for incidental material. these results suggest that cueing a whole sentence containing detail can hinder overall recall  but cueing the specific detail is helpful. overall  these findings provide no evidence that cueing is generally useful  despite the close relationship between some cued material & questions & explicit information on this relationship. mixing questions on cued & non-cued material may remove any possible benefits of cueing. 1 table  5 figures  32 references. adapted from the source document2002,strickler  zoe  neafsey  patricia.,visual design of

editions of learning from las vegas  a collection of studies of the las vegas strip by the architects robert venturi  denise scott brown  and steven izenour. the author considers muriel cooper s original design of the book  which appeared in 1972 and was illustrated with informational graphics  and the revized and reformatted edition that scott brown published in 1977 which reflected an attempt to allow las vegas to reveal itself through the  deadpan  presentation of the data. arguing that the latter failed to realize graphically the main thrust of learning from las vegas  he discusses some of the sources and ideas that informed its production  including the seminal publications the image of the city (1960) by kevin lynch and urban atlas  20 american cities  a communication study notating selected urban data at a scale of 1 48 000 (1966) by joseph r. passonneau and richard saul wurman  analyses in detail cooper s typographic and graphic layout  tracing it

techniques used in aboriginal cultures. 2003,search  patricia.,the metastructural dynamics of interactive electronic design,introduces new kinds of temporal  spatial  and rhythmic links in interactive electronic design that allow and encourage the user to access information outside the framework of narrative and causality. claiming that computer interface designs need to reflect the transformative process that occurs in interactive multimedia computing  the author proposes a new media aesthetic based on metaframes  which use kinaesthetically articulated design to create spatial  temporal  and rhythmic patterns that support multidimensional ways of framing virtual information within the context of the user s physical environment. she illustrates its potential  with reference to an interactive art project exploring the concept of  place name  found in many aboriginal cultures  focusing on the design elements of time  space  rhythm  language  and action  and concludes by

signs identifying public toilets and explores their functions  taking as a starting point charles saunders peirce s distinction between icons  indices  and symbols. she argues that the segregation of toilets and the signage used are both part of the western cultural package that was exported in colonial and post-colonial periods  enquires into the history and evolution of toilet provision  which created the need for pictorial images as a means of identification  and reviews some of the systems developed to facilitate cross-cultural communication  ranging from otto neurath s  isotypes  to the american department of transportation and the olympic signage systems of the 1960s. she concludes by asserting that there are no correlations between the signage used  contemporary cultural practices  and cultural differences  and that illustrative  playful and culturally specific images are more common in less public  remote locations.2003,ciochetto  lynne.,toilet signage as effective communication,the need for clear cross-cultural signage is related to increasing international business recreational travel as well as significant world events like the olympics. using toilet signage

two special issues devoted to research in communication design  examines cognitive factors regulating user search behaviour in web-based media. taking as a starting point the findings of a previous paper that explored user purposes and modes of searching - two critical influences on user search patterns  the authors put forward an analytic framework that might be used to research and better understand those patterns  and to design systems that anticipate the actions  needs  and expectations of a target audience. they identify four main types of generic user goals determining user tasks and distinguishing between primary and secondary goals  between various kinds of web sites  and between exploratory  existence  known-item  comprehensive  and topical modes of searching  and take into account three factors - specification or determination of user needs  urgency  and user contribution to the search task - and distinctive groups of users derived from user analysis data including demographic and technographic profiles. they conclude by showing how the proposed framework might help the planning and the evaluation of web site design.2003,mealing  stuart.,value-added text  where graphic design meets paralinguistics, expressive typography is the sine qua non of the graphic designer-font styles and parameters such as size and color are selected to lend additional interpretive potential to a plain text message. when applied by a designer the process is intuitive and is hardwired to a particular text. value-added text (vat) is an attempt to visually extend the semantic potential of a message still further in a computer-based environment and to render the process both algorithmic and dynamic  its principles being applicable to typographic (and to iconic) text. this paper emphasizes the exploration of potential paralinguistic mappings which exploit and extend the traditional vocabulary of typography. much that can be communicated in human-to-human language is lost in its transfer to text but paralinguistics-which studies the features of communication that accompany  or substitute for  the bare words used-offers a gateway to an enriched presentation of

[publication abstract] 2005,clavez  bertrand.,fluxus  reference or paradigm for youn contemporary artists?,considers the influence of fluxus on young contemporary artists  suggesting that while the reputation of fluxus remains largely invisible its members created the framework within which much contemporary art is made. assesses the similarities between the relational aesthetics outlined in the writings of nicolas bourriaud and the aim of fluxus artists to examine and dismantle the barriers between artist and audience. notes that  in contrast to contemporary work  fluxus events often took place outside of art venues  away from a consenting art audience. assesses the political intentions of the group  in particular those of george maciunas  comparing the political climate in which fluxus operated with that of today  highlighting their appropriation of business models in setting up their own gallery spaces  publishing enterprises and shops  their use of networking through correspondence  newletters and mail art  and their efforts to involve art in a larger society.2005,clavez  bertrand.,fluxus - reference or paradigm for young contemporary artists?, it is often said that fluxus exerts profound influence on contemporary artists. this essay argues that fluxus has done much more than this. this article argues that fluxus has  in fact  established the general frame of contemporary art. fluxus did this by reshaping the paradigm within which art is made in thomas kuhn s sense of the term paradigm. rather than exerting a visible influence on artists  fluxus forms the invisible background to much contemporary art. as a result  young artists are generally unaware of fluxus and its achievements even though they create works that are strongly inspired by it. this article points to similarities and differences between the era in which fluxus was born and the current moment  it examines the relationship of art and artist to audience  the mingling of art and life  cultural institutions and economic structures as key concepts in fluxus work. [publication abstract] 2005,blom  ina.,fluxus futures  ben vautier s signature acts and the historiography of the avant-garde, this essay reads ben vautier s signature work of the 1960s as a historiographic performance that questions the notion of the avant-garde as a tradition. vautier challenges the notion that a continuous stream of new artists finds their place in relation to an historical progression established by avant-garde practices. vautier puts the personal signature to uses that are both ridiculous and revolting  conjuring up a world of violent personal affects. at the same time  his uses of the signature transcend the realm of individual psychology. these signatures repeat the many signature acts of the avant-garde in an obsessive and abject way. ultimately  they produce a notion of the avant-garde itself as one grand territorializing signature gesture that can equally be seen to sign nothing at all. vautier s repetitions are representative of a series of early 1960s event works that open the very notion of an historical avant-garde to new determinations. this type of work also has ramifications for any discussion of fluxus after fluxus. [publication abstract] 2005,blom  ina.,fluxus futures  ben vautier s signature acts and the historiography of the avant-garde,discusses the signature works of french fluxus artist ben vautier (known as ben)  focusing on his questioning and examination of the notion of an avant-garde tradition. assesses the influence of avant-garde artists who have previously created signature works  such as duchamp  yves klein and max stirner  examines the scatological aspects of ben s work and the process of abjection  highlighting the way in which he collapses private emotions  such as jealousy or anxiety  with public display in his posters and other signature pieces  drawing parallels between this and notions of trauma as understood in psychoanalysis. considers ideas put forward by the avant-garde of the early 20th century  in particular by dada and the new realists  such as the death of the author and the world as a total work of art  that ben perceives as a form of total appropriation  leaving him nowhere else to go except to repeat the signature form. describes the search for a totally new shape or form in art that led him to the loops and lines of handwriting  and his interest in holes (as the antithesis of the whole). considers ben as a graffiti artist  compares his work to the writings of georges bataille  and concludes that one of the greatest risks ben takes is that of making sense.2005,friedman  ken  smith  owen.,history  historiography  & legacy, this essay examines issues that typify fluxus work and thinking through reflections on historiography  hermeneutics and historicism. because fluxus actively engenders possibilities and futures  it activates the question of legacy. generating futures entails a dialog with the past. this dialog with history requires historiography  articulate reflection on how we make and write history-and articulate reflection on how we understand it. while such an understanding is necessary for historians who seek to understand the past of a phenomenon such as fluxus  if was of central import to the artists  architects  composers and designers who created fluxus and to those who desire to actively continue the fluxus traditions. this conversation transcends the art world to embrace larger social and cultural aspirations. this key to understanding fluxus has often been overlooked  and it partly explains the failure of mainstream art historians to understand fluxus. the first developments that became fluxus reveal a community of artists  architects  composers and designers with an articulate awareness of history in all its many dimensions. throughout its history  fluxus has continued this multidimensional dialog between the past  present and future. [publication abstract] 2005,friedman  ken  smith  owen f.,history  historiography  and legacy,argues that historiography and historicism provide useful ways of understanding the work of fluxus. states that while fluxus artists were concerned with change and the shaping of possible futures  they in fact displayed an acute awareness of history in all its dimensions  and any consideration of the future requires a dialogue with the past. considers the term  avant-garde  in relation to fluxus  highlighting the work of george maciunas and dick higgins  and noting that fluxus artists came from a variety of artistic and professional backgrounds all of which fed in to their work. analyses the tendency to over-simplify fluxus due to the open and welcoming nature of the art itself  overlooking the way in which fluxus artists thought deeply about culture and society. draws parallels between fluxus and the theoretical assumptions of new historicism  concluding that we can seek to understand fluxus art in its historical context  even though we can never experience it exactly as those present at the original events did.2005,anonymous.,metro letters a typeface for the twin cities, metro letters  a typeface for the twin cities edited by deborah littlejohn is reviewed. 2005,ruecker  stan  homich  eric  sinclair  stÃ©fan.,multi-level document visualization, this paper describes a prototype system that allows readers to view an electronic text in multiple simultaneous views  providing insight at several different levels of granularity  including a reading view. this prospect display is combined with a number of tools for manipulating the text  for example by highlighting sections of interest for a particular task. the result is a powerful approach to working with electronic text for various purposes  sample scenarios are outlined involving directors reading scripts  students studying novels  and second-language learners familiarizing themselves with grammatical constructions.

[publication abstract] 2005,smith  owen f.,teaching and learning about fluxus  thoughts  observations and suggestions from the front lines,the author draws on his experinces as a teacher to argue that it is impossible to understand fluxus through a traditional art-historical approach  as fluxus work demands the participation of the viewer by creating a conceptual framework for thought and experimentation. he describes how fluxus artists rejected the commercialization of the art object and the notion of the artist as genius in favour of emphasising the concept behind an art work  honouring process and intention above the final object  with reference to the works of george maciunas. he explains how they sought to draw the viewer into an active and often playful role  creating for themselves new experiences of art and the world through the lens of the art work  with reference to the writings of fluxus artist dick higgins  noting the potential of fluxus as an educational field and suggesting that fluxus ideas have remained significant and useful forty years after their inception.2005,snart  jason.,unreading william blake s marginalia,though william blake is a central figure in the academy  there is one particular area of his work that receives little attention  the marginalia. and when annotations are incorporated into blake studies  scholars tend to turn for quotation to typeset blake editions  which do not communicate the visual complexity of the annotations. in addition to being visually dynamic  the marginalia provide evidence of blake engaging the printed book of the late 18th and early 19th centuries  and are thus part of his work as a book-maker. blake s books are radically different technologies for representation than are the books he was annotating. further  blake s experience as a reader and annotator are reflected in his poetic universe  in which readers  writers and books figure so prominently.

[publication abstract] 2006,touchon  cecil.,thirty years of fluxing around.,discusses the fluxus art movement. the author notes that art produced through fluxus tends to be experimental  playful  and humorous in nature  compares the fluxus movement to a conversation  rather than a lecture  and draws parallels between fluxus and zen buddhism. he states that despite his work in the medium of visual art  unlike most fluxus artists who work in the media of performance  theatre  and experimental audio works  he had an affinity with fluxus artists  reports on his recent involvement in producing collage poetry and collage sound works  and suggests that fluxus can be compared to a virus which can transcend barriers  and carry on influencing new generations of artists.2006,abulhab  saad d.,typography  behind the arabetic calligraphy veil, in the change from scriptural writing systems to textual mechanical systems and most recently to digital  computer generated text  some languages and their typographic representations have suffered. one such language  along with its visible language representation  that has not made a smooth transition is arabic. the author argues that misinterpreting language tradition prevents what he calls arabetic typography from embracing an appropriate technological adaptation. putting forth an evolutionary argument  he critiques the notion that calligraphic styles must prevail and that legibility and readability of arabic characters are objective. he further states that the resulting typefaces  when the so-called  arabic script rules  are abandoned  are similar in visual impact to the  free calligraphy  typefaces already widely used in the marketplace. finally he challenges the notion that technological maturity has been reached in digital character input and generation. following these critiques  he demonstrates the awkward input system for arabetic text and proposes a natural arabetic input method. a political and economic subtext runs throughout the essay [publication abstract] 2006,abulbab  saad d.,typography  behind the arabetic calligraphy veil,in the change from scriptural writing systems to textual mechanical systems and most recently to digital  computer generated text  some languages and their typographic representations have suffered. one such language  along with its visible language representation  that has not made a smooth transition is arabic. the author argues that misinterpreting language tradition prevents what he calls arabetic typography from embracing an appropriate technological adaptation. putting forth an evolutionary argument  he critiques the notion that calligraphic styles must prevail and that legibility and readability of arabic characters are objective. he further states that the resulting typefaces  when the so-called arabic script rules are abandoned  are similar in visual impact to the free calligraphy typefaces already widely used in the marketplace. finally he challenges the notion that technological maturity has been reached in digital character input and generation. following these critiques  he demonstrates the awkward input system for arabetic text and proposes a natural arabetic input method. a political and economic subtext runs throughout the essay.

(author abstract)2006,klefstad  ann.,what has fluxus created?, a brief survey of current fluxus-based practices and their relation to historical fluxus opens an essay that examines current fluxus-based practice. the author focuses on artists active in fluxlist  an internet discussion list that serves as a central locus of current fluxus activity. klefstad moves on to discuss the contentious problem of canonicity in fluxus  reflecting on the changing role of the art canon in an era of artistic innovation. in such a time  the author contends  critical categories can no longer be the basis of canon construction. instead  collectors and arts institutions create the canon and the rise in economic value of selected artifacts determines their canonical status. at the some time  the exclusive-and exclusionary-nature of the canon helps to establish and reinforce economic value. a complex network of economic and political dynamics points to a central question that asks how such anti-canonical groups such as fluxus can relate to the possibility of such a canon. klefstad concludes by proposing that the continuing spirit of fluxus is found in the actions of those excluded from the canon. [publication abstract] 2006,klefstad  ann.,what has fluxus created?,discusses the current work of fluxus artists. the author refers to the current spread of fluxus ideas  and practices through the internet  and through personal contacts  notes the paradoxical nature of the idea of a  fluxus canon   and studies the development of a  fluxlist  in order to perpetuate dialogue about the fluxus group. she explains that she sought responses from fluxus artists concerning their involvement with fluxus  reprints contributions from alan revich  john ronsen  peter frank  alan bowman  crispin webb  sol nte  and d.b. chirot  and examines the issue of a canon of fluxus works  noting that the group is anti-canonical in nature  and that canons are based on categories that fluxus seeks to avoid. she refers to the role of curators  critics  and commercial interests in shaping perceptions of art  and focuses on the exhibition  the spirit of fluxus   arguing that the show militated against fluxus ideas.2007,davis  stephen boyd.,a schema for depiction, the article proposes a five-part schema for analyzing the design process in constructing visual representations. its purpose is to highlight the multiple ways in which the objectives of a design influence the final form  pictorial pragmatism  driven by the objectives  is taken to be the dominant force in determining that form. the schema is valuable when considering the relationship between aspects of the reality to be modelled and those of the designed representation. while accepting that a useful distinction is captured by the terms realistic and metaphorical  an argument is developed that this distinction cannot be strictly held. the notion of expressivity is examined and the pragmatic model of depiction is further explored  in which expressivity is shown to be often increased by mismatches between what is seen and its graphical representation. the aims of the article are  to question simplistic models of depiction  to provide a simple but robust framework for thinking about depiction and related forms of designing  and to act as a guide in the advanced education of designers  in particular making them aware of the extent of the choices open to them.

[publication abstract] 2012,friedman  ken.,models of design  envisioning a future design education, this article offers a large-scale view of how design fits in the world economy today  and the role of design education in preparing designers for their economic and professional role. the current context of design involves broad-based historical changes including a major redistribution of geopolitical and industrial power from the west to the east. a model of six global economies delineates the challenge and opportunity for design practice and education. while the six economies developed over time  all fit together now and design creates value in different ways across them. understanding the economic context of design education gives clarity to the educational mission  differentiating it from other forms of education. the author argues that design professionals now require a broad range of analytical  conceptual and creative skills related to the social and economic context of design along with advanced skills in a design specialty. a taxonomic chart of design knowledge delineates the range of skills and knowledge domains involved. [publication abstract] 2012,ruecker  stan.,the perennial and the particular challenges of design education, education in design shares with other disciplines a number of perennial challenges  including the need to transfer human culture  the choice of what parts of human culture to transfer and the decision as to what approaches work best in accomplishing that transfer. design education also faces particular challenges  which are shared with only a few other disciplines. these are a predisposition towards the future  the increasing necessity of interdisciplinary approaches and the value for students in participating early in the culture of research. i argue for curricular advancements to accommodate each of these factors  including in particular a design phd modeled on the humanities. finally  i emphasize the importance of providing students with sufficient time to reflect.
