(author abstract)1990,akin  omer.,necessary conditions for design expertise and creativity,understanding the nature of design ability can better enable design educators to nurture its development in their students. such understanding has been promoted by a wide variety of studies of design activity and design behavior. from a review of these studies  design ability is summarised as comprising resolving ill-defined problems  adopting solution-focused cognitive strategies  employing abductive or appositional thinking and using non-verbal modelling media. these abilities are highly developed in skilled designers  but are also possessed in some degree by everyone. a case is therefore made for design ability as a fundamental form of human intelligence. the nurture of this ability through design education is discussed  with particular reference to the problem of providing design education through the distance-learning media of the open university.2009,alexiou  k  zamenopoulos  t  johnson  j h  gilbert  s j.,exploring the neurological basis of design cognition using brain imaging  some preliminary results .,the paper presents a pilot interdisciplinary research study carried out as a step towards understanding the neurological basis of design thinking. the study involved functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) of volunteers while performing design and problem-solving tasks. the findings suggest that design and problem solving involve distinct cognitive functions associated with distinct brain networks. the paper introduces the methodology  presents the findings  and discusses the potential role of brain imaging in design research.

(author abstract)2009,alizon  fabrice  shooter  steven b  simpson  timothy w.,henry ford and the model t  lessons for product platforming and mass customization.,henry ford is recognized as the father of mass production  but his contributions extend well beyond that  offering valuable lessons for product platforming and mass customization. in this paper  we study ford s model t and its many variants in depth and describe insights into ford s vision and his car. in particular  we examine how the platform was built  leveraged and dynamically maintained with continuous improvements to maximize learning and economies of scale. finally  we compare ford s approach to more current approaches for platforming and mass customization. october 2008 marked the 100-year anniversary of the introduction of the model t. in some aspects this old car still outperforms us  and we can learn valuable lessons from its past to avoid future mistakes and improve current practices. (author abstract)2008,amitani  shigeki  bilda  zafer  edmonds  ernest.,our content  generative montage methods for multimedia data.,the concept underlying the research reported in this paper is that of a semi-automatic system with which groups of distributed users interact  primarily by exchanging multimedia data such as short sound recordings  photographs or video clips taken with mobile phones. the generative website is a place where the public can post their own contents such as articles and videos  and then the website generates possible and meaningful sequences of that data by combining the content provided in an interesting and stimulating way. the paper describes the interaction concept  the algorithms for the generative website and an implementation. an evaluation of user experience with the prototype system is also presented. the overall aim of this research is to design and develop methods for interactive generative systems as stimulants to human creativity and it is claimed that this aim is advanced by the research reported. (author abstract)2010,baker  alex  van der hoek  andrÃ©.,ideas  subjects  and cycles as lenses for understanding the software design process.,in this paper  we provide an analysis of three pairs of professional software designers  each working on a provided design problem. to understand these sessions  we track the ideas that were generated  relate them to one another  and categorize them according to the subject being discussed. this data is then used to divide the sessions into design cycles  each of which represents a period of focus on a given aspect of the system being designed. we observe that the designers often consider two subjects at a time  and rotate through subjects in an effort to develop them evenly. the sessions are also characterized by a great deal of repetition  as the designers regularly reconsider previously stated ideas in new contexts. (author abstract)2009,ball  linden j  christenen  bo t.,analogical reasoning and mental simulation in design  two strategies linked to uncertainty resolution.,this paper aims to further an understanding of the nature and function of analogising and mental simulation in design through an analysis of the transcripts of two engineering design meetings. analogies were coded for  purpose  and in terms of whether they were within-domain or between-domain. mental simulations were coded for  focus   technical functional or end-user. all expressions of uncertainty were also identified. analogies were found to be typically between-domain (indicative of innovative reasoning) and were evenly distributed across solution generation  function finding and explanation. mental simulations were predominantly technical functional. our most striking observation was that analogies and mental simulations were associated with conditions of uncertainty. we propose that analogising and mental simulation are strategies deployed to resolve uncertainty - a claim that is supported by the fact that uncertainty levels returned to baseline values at the end of analogising and simulation episodes. (author abstract)2010,ball  linden j  onarheim  balder  christensen  bo t.,design requirements  epistemic uncertainty and solution development strategies in software design.,this paper investigates the potential involvement of epistemic uncertainty in mediating between complex design requirements and strategic switches in software design strategies. the analysis revealed that the designers produced an initial first-pass solution to the given design brief in a breadth-first manner  with this solution addressing several easy-to-handle requirements. the designers then focused on adding relatively complex-to-handle requirements to this initial solution in what appeared to be a depth-first manner  as reflected  for example  by detailed mental simulations that spanned many transcript segments. furthermore  such depth-first development of complex requirements was linked to increases in epistemic uncertainty  a finding that supports the predicted role of uncertainty in mediating between complex requirements and depth-first design. overall these findings support a view of software design as involving a mixed breadth-first and depth-first solution development approach  with strategic switching to depth-first design being triggered by requirement complexity and being mediated by associated feelings of uncertainty. (author abstract)2006,barrios hernandez  carlos roberto.,thinking parametric design  introducing parametric gaudi,this paper presents an innovative methodology for parametric design called design procedures (dp) and shows how it is applied to the columns of the expiatory temple of the sagrada familia. design procedures are actions that generate parametric models where geometrical components are considered as variables. a brief introduction on parametric design is followed by illustrated explanations of the traditional forms of parametric models. design procedures is presented as an alternative to overcome the topological and geometrical limitations of traditional parametric models. the dp is able to generate all original designs by gaudi plus an infinite number of new designs. (author abstract)2009,bates-brkljac  nada.,assessing perceived credibility of traditional and computer generated architectural representations .,this paper presents a study that investigated whether computer generated representations are perceived as more credible means of communicating design than traditional forms of representations. architects  other professionals  and elected members of the public assessed two computer-generated and two hand-drawn forms of representation using semantic differential scales. results show that computer generated photomontage is perceived as the most credible and perspective drawing and as the least credible form of representation. statistical analysis revealed a remarkable resemblance between the responses by the public and professionals and clear differences between these two groups and architects  perceptions. (author abstract)1987,bayazit  nigal.,theoretical basis of a computer-aided design education and research laboratory,the paper considers some of the difficulties associated with incorporating finite element analysis within the total design process. a scenario for future computerized design incorporating the finite element analysis technique is presented and discussed. the feasibility of the scenario is demonstrated using an example from structural steelwork design. certain conclusions and comments are made regarding the effectiveness of seeking to computerize the design process.1993,beheshti  reza.,design decisions and uncertainty,reports on a brief discussion of uncertainty in design situations. uncertainty is an inherent and unavoidable aspect of design decision-making writes the author. the goal is to minimize the influences of the uncertainty factor by increasing the number of structured sets of well defined design criteria and to successfully employ multicriteria decision analysis.1989,bell  malcolm.,from 2d computer-aided draughting to 2d and 3d computer aided design,current developments in computer aided design (cad) have evolved largely through studies of tangible design objects - drawings  documents  models. this may not be an appropriate focus for research attention. the argument is presented here that more significant questions are raised when research is orientated towards the designer s own  self . failure to address questions other than those related only to machines within themselves will fast make cad research irrelevant to design.1989,bell  malcolm.,from 2d computer-aided draughting to 2d and 3d computer-aided design,discusses current developments in computer-aided design (cad). the author proposes that research attention should focus more on the designer s `self  than the study of models  documents and drawings. if the question of design is only directed to machines  cad research will become irrelevant to design.2011,berends  hans  reymen  isabelle  stultiÃ«ns  rutger g l  peutz  murk.,external designers in product design processes of small manufacturing firms.,small manufacturing firms often fail to reap the benefits of good design practices. this study investigates how the involvement of external designers influences the evolution of product design processes in small manufacturing firms. qualitative and quantitative process research methods were used to study 352 events in five joint product development projects. the findings show how these processes iterated between divergence and convergence and between goal setting and idea development. moreover  higher involvement of external designers was associated with more frequent iterations. the paper discusses the implications of these findings for theory on design processes and for design practice. (author abstract)2008,bilda  zafer  edmonds  ernest  candy  linda.,designing for creative engagement .,this paper addresses the problem of understanding creative engagement with interactive systems. a model of engagement is proposed which represents modalities and phases of interactive experiences. the model was derived from empirical studies of audience interaction with art systems. the aim is to provide a means of facilitating communication between participants in the interaction design process. the intention is to help improve collaboration between participants through examining  understanding and agreeing on the set of concepts and modalities on interactive experience. the ongoing research involves refining and developing the model into a more general-purpose instrument. (author abstract)2006,bilda  zafer  gero  john s  purcell  terry.,to sketch or not to sketch? that is the question,in this paper we question whether sketching is essential for conceptual designing. in order to test this hypothesis  we conducted think-aloud experiments with expert architects. they were engaged in two separate design processes  where they were not allowed sketch and where they were allowed to sketch. the comparison of design activities in these two conditions was based on a protocol analysis. the results show that there is no significant difference between sketching and not sketching based on three assessments  design outcome  cognitive activity and idea links. this case study shows that sketching is not an essential activity for expert architects in the early phases of conceptual designing. (author abstract)2007,bilda  zafer  gero  john s.,the impact of working memory limitations on the design process during conceptualization,this paper presents the cognitive activity differences of six expert architects when they design in blindfolded (bf) and sketching (sk) conditions. it was observed that all participants  overall cognitive activity and perceptual activity in the bf sessions dropped below their activity in the sk sessions  approximately after 20 min during the timeline of their design activity. this drop in performance can be explained by higher cognitive demands under bf conditions. in the absence of sketching  architects may experience an overload of visuo-spatial working memory (vswm). we also tested whether this may have an impact on the linking of their design ideas. we previously reported that the intensity and the information content (entropy) of the idea development were not influenced by vswm load. the reach of idea links was found to be smaller in the second half of the bf design sessions. working memory limitations had an impact only on the reach of idea links. we discuss whether these differences are dependent on working memory limitations or idea saturation during conceptual designing. (author abstract)1992,billings  keith  akkach  samer.,a study of technologies and methods in contemporary architectural design teaching  part 1  ideology,the paper is the first part of a study of ideologies and methods in contemporary architectural design teaching. one of the key elements in successful design teaching the authors identify is the setting up of an appropriate environment for nourishing and developing the students  design skills.1987,black  caroline d  baker  michael j.,success through design,refers to industrial design projects as a means of demonstrating the visual thinking processes used to define the physical form of objects. the author explains that these processes appear in the form of drawings and 3-dimensional models  and maintains that drawing  the most versatile modelling technique  reveals the combination of analytical and holistic techniqes employed by the designer.1990,black  i.,back to the future with cad  its impact on product design and development,function sharing is the simultaneous implementation of several functions by a single structural element. this article describes how the idea of function sharing can be used in a computational design procedure that produces efficient designs from modular designs. these ideas have been implemented as a computer program for the domain of mechanical devices that can be described functionally as a network of lumped-parameter idealised elements.1993,blandford  a.,applying the wom to wombat  evaluation of a tool to support learning about design evaluation,considers the issues involved in explicitly teaching students (particularly those in schools of engineering) about design evaluation. the requirements of a computer-based tool to support students learning about this subject are outlined  and a prototype system described. the results of a formative evaluation of this system are discussed  and the strengths and weaknesses of this approach compared to other possible approaches to the teaching of this subject.1990,blandford  ann.,engineering design education  the potential offered by artificial intelligence techniques,changes in art and design education in keeping with general trends elsewhere in education  in particular the application of open learning methods  are bringing about a reappraisal of the design process itself. this paper describes a particular learning package (called calbuid) for design students which shows the extent to which traditional craft apprentice training methods can be systematized for open access and the effect of this on the breadth of the curriculum.2012,blizzard  jacqualyn l  klotz  leidy e.,a framework for sustainable whole systems design,a whole systems approach  considering the interrelatedness of both problems and solutions  can help create more sustainable designs. still  designers often apply exclusively reductionist approaches to generate designs. one way to address this issue is to reduce ambiguity in the whole systems approach. this paper describes research to define and unify elements of whole systems design. elements were identified through a methodical review of sources describing theories  perspectives  and practices from multiple design disciplines. these elements were coded and then organized using concept mapping. the resulting framework has 20 elements categorized as processes  principles  and methods. this framework is meant to help enable more widespread application of whole systems design in practice.1993,booij  nico  holthuijsen  leo h.,the use of sensitivity analysis for design problems,in designing engineering structures one should take into account explicitly the variability of design parameters and of natural forcing claim the authors. one method to analyse the effect of such variability is to carry out a systematic sensitivity analysis they suggest. this usually involves a large number of computations. their paper describes a computer based support system that helps the designer to carry out these computations and to interpret the results. the use of this system is illustrated with an application to the modification of a harbour.2007,boztepe  suzan.,toward a framework of product development for global markets  a user-value-based approach,this paper discusses product development for global markets from the perspective of creating value for users in different cultural settings. based on an ethnographic study on the use of and the value assignment to kitchen appliances of 29 urban families in turkey and the united states  it investigates what constitutes value for users and how user value is shaped by local and cultural context. four major categories of user value are presented. these include utility value  social significance value  emotional value  and spiritual value. a conceptual framework is proposed to assist designers in global companies in (1) the evaluation of existing products in new local contexts  (2) the planning of local research  and (3) the process of decision-making regarding product localization and standardization. (author abstract)1995,brown  f e.,an integrated approach to cad  modelling concepts in building design and construction,the article is concerned with the creation of generic information structure for the construction industry  one that unites data and processes. the authors adopt a multiple perspective approach  acknowledging explicitly the complexities of sharing design information amongst architects  engineers and contractors in building projects. rather than trying to find a lowest common denominator in a design representation  they argue the advantages of applying an object-oriented model to accommodate differing perspectives within a single  comprehensive computer-based description of a building. the challenge ahead is to implement this concept in software and trialing it in practice.1987,brown  stephen.,pheasant  s.t. bodyspace  anthropometry  ergonomics and design.

(london  women s press  1989),examines some of the wider issues and major influences within the general practice of design and asks how information technology can strengthen weak links within the corporate design process. on this basis a theoretical framework is developed which focuses attention on the need to assess information for strategic decision-making and effective design management.1988,bucciarelli  louis l.,an ethnographic perspective on engineering design,a research paper from the massachusetts institute of technology  in which protocols of seven practised designers are analysed to elucidate the nature of design reasoning by empirical analysis. design reasoning was found to be similar to everyday reasoning  its rules being implicit  context dependent and open to critical adjustment. the author argues that such reasoning employs various types  such as references  building types and spatial forms  and that the rules governing such reasoning are derived from  and modified by  such types. these types combine in a spatial gestalt which is the background to the reasoning of designers.the authors argue that design theory in general and computer-aided design in particular rely on an oversimplified view of causation  understanding the structure of a design problem in simple cause-effect terms. while this enhances the computability of design  empirical studies prove that the conception is inadequate. functional dependencies in a design problem are often symmetrical  both the functional dependencies of a problem and its overall structure can be decomposed in a variety of ways  and the concepts of a design problem are often `fuzzy . these complexities are not reflected in the simple causal model.1990,buchanen  richard.,myth and maturity  towards a new order in the decade of design,briefly examines the history of the management and organisation of the product development cycle. looks at some of the key factors that have affected product development  and how information technology through cad may have opened the door to a simultaneous product design process that has more in common with  older  craft-based methods than those developed in the recent industrial era.1995,budgen  david.,â€˜design modelsâ€™ from software design methods,much of the difficulty underlying the development of large software-based systems arises from the complex and abstract nature of software itself  and nowhere is this more evident than in the problems encountered in seeking to establish systematic procedures for designing software. this paper first examines the properties of software and the design practices that are involved in its development  considering in particular how software design methods seek to systemize these. we introduce the use of what we have termed the d-matrix as a means of describing  software design models   and employ this to explore the forms of the models that are developed by following the procedures of a number of well-established software design methods. we conclude by reviewing these models and considering the factors that limit the practices that can be used in such methods  as well as the extent to which the more recently developed design methods can minimize their effects.2011,burdick  anne  willis  holly.,digital learning  digital scholarship and design thinking.,this paper identifies opportunities for design thinking to be integrated into digital learning and digital scholarship initiatives. the paper traces how the rise of digital culture has led to the reconsideration of models for learning and the call for new modes of knowledge production  spearheaded by an array of fields from writing programs to computer science. drawing upon case studies from new media education and the digital humanities  the paper argues that design thinking that is situated  interpretive  and user-oriented is well suited to these initiatives. the paper concludes with a call for design thinking research to engage with emerging models for learning and knowledge production  work whose effects could be felt at an epistemic level for generations.

(author abstract)2007,candi  marina.,the role of design in the development of technology-based services,the goal of this paper is to examine the role of design in the development of technology-based services and reports on case research undertaken in new firms. design was found to be applied to a broad range of service aspects in the case firms  namely user interfaces  tangible artifacts  documents  usability  service processes  revenue models  communication processes  community building  customer experiences and marketing materials. the application of design in the case firms was found to be motivated in part by the desire to either counteract or exploit one or more of the distinguishing characteristics of services  which are intangibility  inseparability  heterogeneity and perishability. (author abstract)2010,candi  marina.,the sound of silence  re-visiting silent design in the internet age.,the silent design concept  suggested by gorb and dumas in 1987 has been used for over 20 years to deal with the issue that design sometimes happens without designer participation and sometimes without even being referred to or recognized as design. in this article  silent design is re-visited in the context of innovation and against the backdrop of the internet. the findings are that silent design is still alive and kicking and more common in firms that rely on the internet for the delivery of their offerings than other firms. the findings also indicate that firms that use overt design (the opposite of silent design) tend to perform better than firms that use silent design in terms of attracting new customers. however  overt design comes at a cost  which this research suggests is reflected in less profitability in firms using overt design than in firms using silent design. (author abstract)2006,cardella  monica e  atman  cynthia j  adams  robin s.,mapping between design activities and external representations for engineering student designers,many design researchers have attempted to characterize design through the different activities the designer exhibits  such as problem framing  solution generation  and evaluating alternative solutions. others have documented the way that sketching supports design. this study combines these approaches to understanding design by exploring the interplay between designers  representations and their design activities in a set of four case studies. we analyzed verbal protocols collected from two senior and two freshman engineering students. the four students exemplify the significant design activity findings from a previous study. in this paper  we present the results from the analysis of the four design protocols  focusing on the relationship between representation and design activity  and on differences between the freshmen and seniors in our sample in the way that they make and use design sketches. we discuss these findings with a focus on improving design education.

(author abstract)2009,carvalho  lucila  dong  andy  maton  karl.,legitimating design  a sociology of knowledge account of the field.,this paper presents a sociology of knowledge approach to describe disciplines in the field of design. we show how the approach casts the nature of knowledge in design disciplines as based upon socially agreed criteria for what constitutes the realization of legitimate knowledge. interviews with designers and analyses of professional and pedagogic discourse about design are used to illustrate how the approach reveals the differences in what kind of design knowledge is valued  cultivated  and emphasised within a discipline. by placing a sociological lens on knowledge in design  we aim to suggest a language by which what counts as design knowledge can be explicitly expressed. a common  shared language to describe the differences opens a mechanism to discuss what can count as knowledge  rather than to retreat into corners and only agree to disagree that there are different knowledges in design.

(author abstract)1988,chen  tun sing  sanoff  henry.,the patients view of their domain,discusses a study using the psychological method of protocol analysis to analyse the verbal behaviour of a small group of designers engaged in problem-solving. protocol analysis is a research methodology based on the psychological theory of information processing and is said to offer the community of design scientists a potentially effective method for the controlled observation and experimental analysis of design problem-solving behaviour. the author notes that there was some evidence to indicate that designers vary significantly in the nature and amount of information processed during problem-solving. much work remains to be done in order to establish protocol analysis as a valid design research tool  but the potential for experimentally testing research hypotheses is great  provided larger subject-samples are utilized. educationally  it could be of potential as a diagnostic tool  or as an instrument to show students the `form  of their problem-solving  of which they may be singularly unconscious.1993,chinowsky  paul  teicholz  paul.,the design of user interfaces for intelligent layout generation systems,the authors report on the development of user interfaces for  intelligent  layout generation systems for architectural design.1987,chitty  andrew.,information technology and people,all the professions are experiencing rapid change in their ideological bases. the design professions also are caught in this flux. the pressures for change can be characterized as a clash between two competing ways of experiencing reality  the one self-centred (in the literal sense)  the other cosmocentric...each has organismic survival value  and each has a significant role to play in the creative process. this paper describes a new way of structuring group design processes to take advantage of these differences in perception. these processes reveal archetypal formal solutions which otherwise would remain below the threshold of conscious thought...the implicit idea behind this methodology is that group processes are more powerful than individual processes  that they are capable of rendering deeper  more profound solutions  but that they require a radically different approach to criticism and evaluation.1993,christiaans  h  van andel  j.,the effects of examples on the use of knowledge in a student design activity  the case of the â€˜flying dutchmanâ€™,the authors investigate the role of knowledge in the design process. more specifically they are concerned with the question of accessibility and conditions for information from external sources. they explain two different ways of presenting information to industrial design students (using as an example the design of a go-cart). their research suggests that visual  pictorial or graphical information has a stronger effect than verbal or written information.2010,christiaans  henri  almendra  rita assoreira.,accessing decision-making in software design .,this paper presents an analysis of software design protocols as one of the contributions to the 2010 international workshop  studying professional software design . the aim of the study described here is to analyse the design process of software designers and to compare the results with that of product designers  an area familiar to the authors. decision-making is the main focus of this study. a descriptive model of decision-making  developed by the authors  has been used to analyse the protocols of the three software design teams. the results give insight in how software designers process their activities  on the influence of individual or team differences  and what the consequences for their outcomes are.

(author abstract)1993,cooper  rachel davies.,investigating british and european retail buyer attitudes and perceptions of british design,the author describes a study into the attitudes and perceptions of british and european retail buyers towards the design of british ceramic tableware  small domestic appliances  and household fabrics  as compared with their perceptions of the design of foreign products in those categories. it was found that european buyers perceived british products in all three categories to lack design innovation  compared with products of other origin. european buyers were less convinced by brand name and reputation than british buyers particularly in the ceramics. the study confirms the earlier findings  that many british manufacturers rely on traditional patterns and design  and do not invest in design to develop new products.1993,coyne  richard  snodgrass  adrian.,rescuing cad from rationalism,artificial intelligence (ai) holds sway in some quarters as providing valuable insights into design and the use of computers in design. ai seems to be grounded within the  traditional  epistemology and ontology of descartes. there are problems with ai in design  however  attributable to the tacit acceptance of this limited ontology. in contrast  the ontology of heidegger asserts the primacy of the inconspicuous world of total involvement as the start of an understanding of being. a heideggerian view displaces computerisation as the basis of understanding. in this article the working of metaphors we have at our disposal for understanding design  are open for evaluation in terms of its usefulness for design.1991,coyne  richard  snodgrass  adrian.,is designing mysterious? challenging the dual knowledge thesis,the author reports on a research programme based on interviews with designers  the observation of drawing practices and the analysis of designers  drawings. the aim of the research was to clarify the ways in which drawing is employed. designers were observed to use drawing throughout the analysis and development of design solutions  beginning with the initial briefing session  and  furthermore  drawing was found to be used for conducting managerial procedures  for fostering creative behaviour and for various forms of communication by members of the design team. a representative model for the graphic design process is discussed.2008,crilly  nathan  good  david  matravers  derek  clarkson  p john.,design as communication  exploring the validity and utility of relating intention to interpretation.,the relationship between how designers intend products to be interpreted and how they are subsequently interpreted has often been represented as a process of communication. however  such representations are attacked for allegedly implying that designers  intended meanings are somehow  contained  in products and that those meanings are passively received by consumers. instead  critics argue that consumers actively construct their own meanings as they engage with products  and therefore that designers  intentions are not relevant to this process. in contrast  this article asserts the validity and utility of relating intention to interpretation by exploring the nature of that relationship in design practice and consumer response. communicative perspectives on design are thereby defended and new avenues of empirical enquiry are proposed. (author abstract)2009,crilly  nathan  moultrie  james  clarkson  p john.,shaping things  intended consumer response and the other determinants of product form .,based on a series of interviews with practicing industrial designers  a framework is developed that represents designers as holding distinct intentions for how product visual form should be interpreted by consumers (e.g. perceived qualities). these intentions are driven by various motivating factors (e.g. the brand) and constrained by other factors (e.g. production costs). designers seek to resolve these competing factors by referring to a broad range of visual sources (e.g. existing products)  and by constructing visual representations (e.g. sketches) that describe the planned form for the product. despite designers  efforts to specify the product s form  the eventual form may be outside their control because still other factors (e.g. manufacturing tolerances) modify the design in unanticipated ways. (author abstract)2010,crilly  nathan.,the roles that artefacts play  technical  social and aesthetic functions.,the concept of  function  is often employed and sometimes defined in such a way that it only relates to how artefacts can be used to satisfy physical goals (e.g. transportation). using artefacts to satisfy non-physical goals (e.g. social recognition) is typically described without reference to an artefact s function. by drawing on the various disciplines that are concerned with function  this article demonstrates that there are many different kinds of function  some of which will account for non-physical uses. by referring to these different kinds of function we can reduce the conceptual distance between physical and non-physical uses. furthermore  by applying the concept of function to non-physical uses our understanding of such uses can benefit from prior work on function.

(author abstract)2009,dong  andy  kleinsmann  maaike  valkenburg  rianne.,affect-in-cognition through the language of appraisals.,the premise of this paper is that affect is a basis for rationality and that affective processing is a constituent component of design thinking. the paper focuses on the influence of the valence of affective judgments on design thinking. transcripts of design meetings are coded according to a formal  linguistic analysis of the semantic resources for appraisals  the display of sentiment and subjectivity in language. the research indicates that the appetitive or aversive orientation of appraisals has design thinking consequences on knowledge integration and generation. during knowledge integration  negative appraisals accompany periods of technical analysis and engineering new design solutions  conversely  positive appraisals accompany a reliance on general knowledge and background experience. during knowledge generation  positive appraisals are associated with the creation of knowledge while negative appraisals are associated with  being stuck . (author abstract)2007,dong  andy.,the enactment of design through language,if designers engage in a conversation with the situation they are shaping as donald schon theorizes  how is design materialized through these conversations? if language metonymically refers to design by intertwining with designers in an ontological circuit of recognition that harnesses and represents that which can be conversed and said  does language itself participate in the enactment of design? this article introduces the performative aspects of the language of design  aggregation  accumulation  and appraisal. forms of semantics and grammatical structures of design text are lines of compositions through which these performative aspects enact design practice and actualize the designed work. reviews of theories of performativity and empirical studies of the language of design show a connection between what is said and written about design ing and the productive force of language.

(author abstract)2009,galle  per.,the ontology of gero s fbs model of designing .,recent work by vermaas and dorst has led to constructive criticism and conceptual clarification of gero s fbs (function-behaviour-structure) model of designing. in this paper vermaas  and dorst s version of the model is scrutinized  with an emphasis on its temporal aspect and ontological implications. regarding the latter  the model is found to be in need of amendment and further refinement to ensure its clarity and logical coherence. to this end  two alternative modifications of the model are developed. these results are not claimed to be of immediate practical use to designers. rather  they are intended to contribute to a reliable conceptual foundation for research and tool development that may aim more directly at supporting design practice.

(author abstract)2008,huang  yinghsiu.,investigating the cognitive behavior of generating idea sketches through neural network systems,design can be regarded as a seeing-moving-seeing process  where designers repeatedly see and generate ideas that are based on what they have done. the crucial point of design thinking is how designers recognize ambiguous shapes from sketches and then transfer them into different shapes. this study attempts to conduct cognitive experiments to elucidate the sketching process and to simulate two types of sketching behavior used by neural network systems. when exhibiting the first type of sketching behavior  designers are able to transform their original sketches to satisfy requirements. simulating this type of visual cognitive behavior by neural networks could help computers modify shapes to meet design requirements  as human designers do. when demonstrating the second type of sketching behavior  designers are able to see an ambiguous shape as different complete shapes so as to associate divergent design ideas. another set of neural networks investigated in this study could also associate different shapes by adjusting the tsl and produce different idea sketches from the same shape.

(author abstract)1995,liu  yu-tung.,some phenomena of seeing shapes in design,using a series of simple experiments the author explored the fundamentals of how designers  novice and experienced  perceived shape. he discovered that the lower the  threshold of recognition activation (tra)  the more likely an individual is to perceive emergent shapes not simply the obvious  explicit shapes. it is argued that if designers can lower their tra they will then see and interpret shapes differently or at least with greater flexibility  resulting in more creative designs.1994,lloyd  peter  scott  peter.,discovering the design problem,the authors use a protocol analysis of a design engineering task to distinguish between various forms of design utterance  generative  deductive and evaluative. they hypothesize that fragments of their three models will be found in any one design discipline  to present a cognitive framework independent of the particular type of design  which they examine using observational methods. they conclude that experience plays a key role in determining the design process.2009,lloyd  peter.,ethical imagination and design .,using transcripts of both architectural and engineering design meetings this chapter shows how the fields of ethics and design inter-relate  especially in the area of creative imagination. the chapter first draws on the concept of a  virtual building  to show how essential aspects of designerly thinking can apply to ethics. it then goes on to show how  in the process of designing  designers engage explicitly and implicitly with ethical issues. the chapter discusses four extended examples from two design processes - one involving the design of a crematorium the other involving the design of a digital pen - before suggesting that by addressing ethical subjects without framing them in explicitly ethical ways  the design process allows us to  imaginatively trace out the implications of our metaphors  prototypes and narratives  a key element of ethical decision-making according to the philosopher mark johnson.

(author abstract)2006,luck  rachael  mcdonnell  janet.,architect and user interaction  the spoken representation of form and functional meaning in early design conversations,the paper is an investigation of the exchange of ideas and information between an architect and building users in the early stages of the building design process before the design brief or any drawings have been produced. the purpose of the research is to gain insight into the type of information users exchange with architects in early design conversations and to better understand the influence the format of design interactions and interactional behaviours have on the exchange of information. we report an empirical study of pre-briefing conversations in which the overwhelming majority of the exchanges were about the functional or structural attributes of space  discussion that touched on the phenomenological  perceptual and the symbolic meanings of space were rare. we explore the contextual features of meetings and the conversational strategies taken by the architect to prompt the users for information and the influence these had on the information provided. recommendations are made on the format and structure of pre-briefing conversations and on designers  strategies for raising the level of information provided by the user beyond the functional or structural attributes of space. (author abstract)2007,luck  rachael.,learning to talk to users in participatory design situations,in participatory design situations the competence of the facilitator will influence the opportunities for a user group to become engaged in the process of design. based on the observation of the conversations from a series of design workshops  the performance of design facilitation expertise by an expert architect is compared with a less experienced architectural graduate. the skills that are the focus of this research are the conversational competences deployed by architects to engage users in the design of an architectural project. the difference between the conversational behaviour of a project architect and a less experienced graduate was observed to illustrate with examples the effect the performance of facilitation had on the opportunity for user engagement in design  and of learning the skill of facilitation that occurred in these situations.

(author abstract)2007,matthews  ben.,locating design phenomena  a methodological excursion,an analysis is presented of a design meeting in which users and other stakeholders enter the design dialogue as  others  who are talked about and spoken for in absentia  with particular attention paid to the circumstances in which these others are invoked. this lays an empirical foundation from which to premise a methodological discussion about researchers  practices of identifying design phenomena to analyse. in many analytical treatments  the circumstances in and through which phenomena (e.g. designers  actions) emerge tend to be stripped from those phenomena when they are treated as objects of analytical interest. this hides the actual work that designers are doing  work that is only recoverable through consideration of the circumstances in which design moves are made in interaction. such analytic practices can be prone to generate an alien or ironic understanding of designers  work. this does not condemn such analytic approaches  but the point remains that there is much of importance that  falls through the cracks  in such analytical treatments  particularly since a pivotal objective of many forms of design research is to account for design activity. (author abstract)2006,mcalpine  h  hicks  b j  huet  g  culley  s j.,an investigation into the use and content of the engineer s logbook,the majority of engineers maintain a logbook  or some form of personal notes. many of these logbooks contain a significant amount of design information and knowledge which is not formally reported. despite this  logbooks are rarely formally managed  with the content only available to the authoring engineer. it is arguable that such potentially valuable information should be available to the wider organisation  where it could be of considerable benefit. it follows that there is a need to create improved strategies for managing logbooks. however  prior to achieving this  it is first necessary to understand and characterise the use and information content of current engineering logbooks. this paper presents the results of a detailed survey and analysis of a variety of engineering logbooks  focussing on exploring how and why engineers use logbooks and revealing the various classes of information they contain.

(quotes from original text)2011,mcdonnell  janet.,impositions of order  a comparison between design and fine art practices.,this paper explores the similarities and differences in the strategies used by designers and fine art practitioners to impose enabling constraints on a project. enabling constraints are defined as devices  arbitrary  pragmatic  aesthetic and other which artists or designers impose to create coherence in a work or to create a discipline for the working process. the paper draws on the literature on how designers impose order  juxtaposing this characterization with a case study of a long-term collaborative fine art practice. it concludes that further understanding of design creativity arising from prepared minds might come from investigating other forms of creative practice  and that long-term collaborative practice is a more appropriate focus for understanding how order that enables creativity is imposed than studies focusing on single projects.

(author abstract)1987,newlands  paul  powell  james a  creed  chris.,understanding architectural designers,examines the moment of insight when an idea is formed  particularly in the work of designers. koestler s notion of bi-sociation   whereby two areas of thought overlap to create insight  is examined in this context  along with t. bastic s theory that insight and intuition are synonymous. the nature of insight is explored through the use of interviews with members of the royal society of arts faculty of royal designers for industry. from these interviews  it appears that at the moment of its realization  the idea is perceived as a separate entity from the perceiver. the moment of perception and assimilation of the idea is termed the imago . the formation of a personal sense of identity and the experience of such an imago  are considered as aspects of the creative process which lead to awareness of higher levels of creative thinking.1988,newton  sidney  logan  brian s.,causation and its effect  the blackguard in cad s clothing,the author describes the application of a systematic design methodology to the production of an engineering product. the 10-stage process is described  and the author claims that the methodology proved successful in terms of both the design and its cost. the methodology can be applied to products of all sizes  though it must be balanced by other non-design values  and can be used to organize the work of new designers and students. the basic steps of a design process have been reviewed and applied to seek an optimum solution for an industrial design problem. the problem was about a mechanical swivel-joint in a sea-current-metering system for underwater marine use. it was expensive and not functioning properly because of the rattling and high friction between parts. the objective was to design another joint of better performance and lower cost  if possible. ten steps were defined and carefully followed to solve the problem. this led to the design and production of a good quality swivel-joint as far as performance  appearance and other aspects were concerned and the cost reduced by 40%. this design method  in addition to yielding good results  is suitable for the organization of the activities of new designers and design students (abstract).1989,newton  sidney.,the irrelevant machine,presents the results

that design activity pervades organizations  the paper describes the methodology used to examine how design is organized. using matrices to explore the interaction of design with other business functions  the report suggests that  silent design  (that is design by people who are not designers and are not aware that they are participating in design activity) goes on in all the organizations examined  even those which have formal design policies and open design activities.2011,nilsson  birgitta  peterson  barbro  holden  georgina  eckert  claudia.,design med omtanke  participation and

(author abstract)1991,oakley  mark.,heskett  john. philips  a study of the corporate management of design. (london  trefoil  1989),the lack of intelligent support offered by current computer aided design (cad) systems  despite the obvious need  has resulted in attempts to apply proven methods of knowledge based systems (kbs ) and artificial intelligence to the field of cad  in order to bridge the intelligence gap. experience gained from the application of kbs technology suggests that the incorporation of higher levels of knowledge will result in more powerful  usable and intelligent computer systems. the power of such intelligent systems will clearly depend on the quality and depth of knowledge on which they are based. it is argued that the most direct and accurate source of such information is provided by the domain expert. however  the transformation of expert understanding remains the difficult problem of knowledge elicitation. this paper argues that thorough knowledge elicitation procedures in the domain of design are needed to enable the development of more powerful icad systems. an important concept arising from the use of kbs technology is the value of a human communicable understanding of the domain  in terms of a testable  machine independent model of cognition. in this paper we describe a method of knowledge elicitation that has been applied in the domain of page layout design. using this method an elaborate model of the page layout design has been successfully developed. it is argued that this study demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of applying knowledge acquisition techniques to design tasks.1988,oberdorfer  jeff.,community participation in the design of the boulder creek branch library,this article presents findings and techniques from two open space projects - one a neighbourhood playground  the other an elementary schoolyard - found to be useful in clarifying differences in open space values and preferences. specific differences between child and adult views of these places are reviewed. how participation and research was utilized to help resolve basic open space differences is discussed. the article concludes with a brief review of future issues facing research and design participation. (abstract).2006,okudan  gul e  mohammed  susan.,task gender orientation perceptions by novice designers  implications for engineering design research  teaching and practice,this paper presents a study where (1) task gender orientation perceptions of novice designers  and (2) reasons underlying the perceived gender orientation were studied. data collection included both quantitative and qualitative methods. results indicate that indeed  design tasks may be seen as having a gender orientation due to perceptions regarding the design task domain. further  if a task domain is deemed as favoring a gender  the reasons for doing so are related to the gender associations of institutions  objects  actions  and related knowledge. in terms of implications for future research  the current study suggests that the gender orientation of tasks can vary considerably and should be controlled for or taken into account when interpreting design performance results. in terms of implications for engineering design teaching  it is recommended that careful attention be given to the selection of applied projects in order to avoid domains with strong masculine or feminine overtones. instead  the design problem should be framed to be gender neutral.

(author abstract)2006,pektas  sule tasli  pultar  mustafa.,modelling detailed information flows in building design with the parameter-based design structure matrix,the architecture engineering construction (aec) industry is one of the multidisciplinary domains in which collaboration among related parties is of utmost importance. despite the intense flow of information between design professionals  there is a lack of research to better understand and manipulate these flows. most of the current process modelling tools in the aec industry do not enable analyses of iterative information cycles. moreover  these tools represent the process at high levels  thus  they are inadequate for multi-parameter problems like building design. with a view to alleviate these problems  this paper introduces the use of parameter-based design structure matrix as a process modelling and system analysis tool for building design. the method reveals insights into the process structure  optimum sequence of parameter decisions  iterative cycles and concurrency in the process. the application of the method is demonstrated through a case study on suspended ceiling design in a real-life project. (author abstract)1994,peng  chengzhi.,exploring communication in collaborative design  co-operative architectural modelling,an exploration of communication in collaborative design from the perspective of co-operative architectural modelling is reported. the objectives and problems of communication in collaborative design are described and analysed by viewing design as  basically  disciplines of modelling complex objects. three cases of teamwork in architectural modelling are studied  each demonstrating a rich and informative approach to collaboration. looking at the cases from the co-operative modelling perspective  important conditions for communication are observed  firstly the participation and co-ordination among heterogeneous systems of representation and action that individual members of a design team work with  and secondly  the interconnection between common goals shared by all participants and domain-oriented goals pursued by individuals. in exploring how the conditions were met  it was found useful to characterize communication in terms of the inter-relations between common images and distributed design developments. two generic patterns of communication in collaborative design were found  which suggest two alternative conceptual frameworks for developing computational representations.2006,peng  chengzhi.,in-situ 3d concept design with a virtual city,based on a previously developed web-based multi-tiered virtual city server  this paper reports on a further study into how online virtual city models can be turned into digital canvas for urban designers to engage in 3d concept design modelling. this research design environment  called townscaping  provides a set of tools for users to instantiate and edit 3d graphic elements that can be positioned directly onto the virtual city model retrieved from the web server. because of the visual immersion and interaction afforded by virtual world technology  early concept designs could be developed as though they are worked out by designers working directly on the site  hence in-situ 3d concept design.

(author abstract)2006,sass  larry  oxman  rivka.,materializing design  the implications of rapid prototyping in digital design,rapid prototyping (rp) today is absorbed into practice and is being recognized as a significant technology for design. this paper attempts to formulate key aspects of the design methodological framework that are coalescing with rp s capability to build artifacts as part of the creative design process. in doing so  it attempts to formulate questions and issues of rp as a design medium that supports the full spectrum of digital design as a paperless process. these issues have been the resultant of early experimental and hands-on involvement with rp technologies in research and educational environments. in this paper  a ddf method (digital design fabrication) is introduced. the ddf method is a two-stage process of working that integrates generative computing and rp into one process. together they support a process to generate diverse candidate artifacts as solutions to design problems. through a presentation of issues  procedural observations  and research findings  a range of potential applications of the ddf model are defined and presented. it demonstrates a process of design situated between conceptual design and real-world construction. (author abstract)1988,schÃ¶n  donald a.,designing  rules  types and worlds,this paper addresses one of the basic assumptions to underpin design theory in general and computer-aided design research in particular. it is the notion of causation. an argument is presented that design hinges on an understanding of the dependencies and interrelationships which uniquely structure each design problem. unfortunately  structure  appears to be interpreted by the wider research community in simple cause and effect terms  possibly because it then merges extremely well within computer technologies such as the expert system. studies have shown  however  that taking such an over-simplistic view of causation poses fundamental problems. these problems have the potential completely to undermine much of current design research. (abstract).1991,schenk  pamela.,the role of drawing in the graphic design process,the work of christopher alexander and his associates on the pattern language approach to environmental design is considered from the point of view of the variety of forces which oppose its implementation. it is argued that as a radical paradigm shift in environmental design  the pattern language faces opposition from epistemological  political  ideological and aesthetic  enemies . these oppositions are fundamental to the nature of the paradigm shift proposed  and they reveal some of the dilemmas in the theory and practice of environmental design.2012,scott  kakee  bakker  conny  quist  jaco.,designing change by living change.,as design for sustainability extends beyond its origins in engineering  and therefore production  increasing attention has been put on the roles technologies and designed artifacts play in mitigating or exacerbating consumption-related impacts. however  there is a prevalence of efforts in user-centered and behavior-based design lacking the systemic perspectives necessary to appropriately address the social nature of consumption. in response  interest has grown for applying theories of social practice to design processes in order to address the socio-technical dynamics behind consumption. this paper introduces a methodology for  practice-oriented design  using collaborative processes of discursive analysis and experimentation in everyday life. a pilot study conducted for the eu living lab project  using a case on bathing  demonstrates early exploration work.

(author abstract)2012,smith  shana  smith  gregory  shen  ying-ting.,redesign for product innovation.,in today s market  most companies redesign to create new products. redesign improves product quality and reduces cycle time. however  most techniques limit innovation. they modify a single reference product  which closely matches user needs  and only introduce new products when major conflicts exist between user needs and existing products. this study introduces a new redesign for product innovation approach. the approach combines two or more distinct reference designs into a single new product. the process creates design conflicts. the induced conflicts stimulate innovation. at the same time  the approach uses structured redesign techniques and structured design principles to overcome the conflicts  which improves solution quality and reduces cycle time. the study also presents a case study to demonstrate the approach.

(author abstract)2007,stamps iii  arthur e.,evaluating spaciousness in static and dynamic media,this article presents two studies on the following questions  (a) which physical properties of environments influence impressions of spaciousness? and (b) does it make a difference whether the environments are shown as static images or as dynamic virtual reality models? work on the first question was motivated by the fact that lack of spaciousness can be a strong ambient stressor and the hope that  if suitably designed  spaces can seem larger than they actually are and thus space as perceived can be enhanced without recourse to the very expensive solution of constructing an actually larger space. work on the second question was motivated by the professional need to predict peoples  responses to future buildings as efficiently as possible. virtual reality programs are currently readily available  but are they cost effective? study 1 indicated that  for the factors of floor area  occlusion  and light  impressions of spaciousness could indeed be modified without recourse to making larger spaces. study 2 indicated that  with appropriate choice of viewpoints  findings regarding spaciousness obtained from static simulations corresponded highly with findings obtained from virtual reality models.

(quotes from original text)1994,stolterman  erik.,guidelines or aesthetics  design learning strategies,the author discusses different preconceptions and assumptions about the nature of design work by confronting idealised versions of two typical approaches to design education  the  guideline approach  and the  aesthetic approach . he argues that both design teachers and design students should be aware of these presumptions and concludes that design education should have as its first goal  to stimulate a continuous process of reflection on the nature of design practice.2010,stones  catherine  cassidy  tom.,seeing and discovering  how do student designers reinterpret sketches and digital marks during graphic design ideation? .,this paper discusses and examines the impact that design tools have on reinterpretation during graphic design ideation activity. it discusses the vital role that reinterpretation plays in the design process and reviews existing empirical studies concerning reinterpretation. it also discusses broadly the differences in ambiguity levels of conventional paper-based sketches and digital tools. the paper presents results of an experiment designed to capture and compare instances of reinterpretation by student designers. the results suggest that  while students are capable of reinterpreting the digital marks as other forms  they are less successful at turning those new digital forms into new ideas. it would appear that whilst not causing reinterpretation  paper-based sketches  more than digital tools  can support the vital process of reinterpretation that generates new ideas. (author abstract)2007,stones  catherine  cassidy  tom.,comparing synthesis strategies of novice graphic designers using digital and traditional design tools,this paper presents the results of an empirical experiment designed to compare synthesis strategies adopted by novice designers when using paper-based and computer-based tools. a taxonomy of six synthesis strategies was devised from the dataset. the results suggest that not only was paper-based sketching more effective in producing more solutions than digital working but was also more effective in supporting one particular synthesis strategy. a discussion follows regarding the type of graphical language chosen by novice designers  concluding that the use of symbolic systems such as fonts during synthesis tasks may restrict the scope of design ideas. (author abstract)2007,sung  tung-jung  you  manlai.,a method for establishing an online design audit platform,auditing is getting its share of attention as a means of identifying gaps between current and desired performance in many activities. furthermore  the audit approach has been evolving from the traditional manual process of paper documentation to a paperless  electronic  and online one. yet online auditing in relation to design activities within an enterprise remains largely unexplored. to provide a useful design audit tool  in this study  we aimed to develop an online design audit platform (odap) for internal application within an enterprise. in doing so  we first set the context of the odap by constructing a design audit matrix that encompassed six organizational levels and five operational phases. second  based on the design audit matrix  we developed an online design audit framework for the odap. third  the odap was tested and evaluated with the cooperation of 20 participating taiwanese enterprises. the results show that the odap is a good-quality information system in terms of system quality  information quality and interface design though there are some shortcomings  such as the lack of a score-weighted function  a comment database  and a mechanism for information customization. in this paper  we discuss the implications of these findings and suggest several avenues for further research.

(author abstract)2011,tonkinwise  cameron.,a taste for practices  unrepressing style in design thinking.,the current vogue for design in management discourses results in abstractions of the design process that repress the role of aesthetic judgments. this paper offers an explanation as to why design-as-styling is being neglected or concealed  and then explains what is at stake. it theorizes that a key aspect of the agency of designing  as the creation of artifacts to facilitate activities  lies in this taste literacy of designers. the framework for the argument of this paper is pierre bourdieu s notion of  habitus  and the notion of  style  as proposed by fernando flores and his coauthors. the paper argues that designers are hermeneutists of proximal taste regimes  for the possibilities of new styles of action. (author abstract)1994,tovey  michael.,form creation techniques for automotive design,although there is a significant commitment to the use of cad in the car industry  the industrial designer makes less use of it than engineering designers do. vehicle stylists responsible for the early stages of the process have found that cad systems and procedures are ill-suited to their methods and needs. as there are considerable potential benefits to the overall process if it can be based around integrated cad systems using common data bases  there are good reasons for devising procedures for automotive stylists that overcome the problems which cad systems seem to present. this project has been concerned with devising such procedures. it has included a collaborative exercise with a motor manufacturer and has resulted in a collection of recommended techniques for form creation on cad for automotive designers.1989,tovey  michael.,drawing and cad in industrial design,architecture  the craft of making buildings  has been reduced to an alliance of taste and capital  of art and profit  of style and power. contemporary architectural practice  form torn constantly from content  the aesthetic negated  reduced to looks  dressed up as art. this  the taken-for-granted orthodoxy of architectural thought must be opposed  resisted. such resistance is rooted in the concept and practice of craftsmanship  in the fusion of pleasure and work - an overcoming of alienated labour.1989,tovey  michael.,drawing and cad in industrial design,this paper reviews some developments in architectural education  based on the integrated design subschool at the university of auckland school of architecture. the developments are related to issues of the  rationality  of the architectural design process and of the modern movement. the  rationality  of modernism is shown to be a myth.1991,trueman  myfanwy m.,good practice makes perfect or profit  can we use computing to design more effectively,designing is a kind of positive conscious activity. however  it is still separate from material conditions temporarily. only in construction and production can the material condition be directly changed into a state of motion. all creative designing has practice as its profound and solid basis and originates mostly from experience. industrial designing must be from practice to cognition  and then from cognition to practice  a cycle which will be repeated many times  even endlessly. this is the law of designing. designing can be made active and lively only by work conforming to its properties  characteristics and law.2008,tseng  ian  moss  jarrod  cagan  jonathan  kotovsky  kenneth.,the role of timing and analogical similarity in the stimulation of idea generation in design.,an experiment was conducted to gain an understanding of how people assimilate and apply newly acquired information when ideating solutions to a design problem by studying how the nature of problem-relevant information and timing of when it is given can affect idea generation in an open-ended design problem. more specifically  the effects of presenting surface similar information before design conceptualization  or surface dissimilar information before and during design conceptualization on the quantity  breadth  and novelty of solutions generated were analyzed. the effects of open goals  fixation  and priming  as well as their implications in design problem solving are examined. it was found that information that is more distantly related to the design problem impacted idea generation more when there was an open goal to solve the problem  while information that is more obviously similar to the problem impacted idea generation more than distantly related information when seen before problem solving has begun. evidence of induced design fixation and priming were also observed.

(author abstract)1987,wan  tan boon.,the architect as a purchaser of cad systems  a study of potential cognitive dissonance,current developments of a scientific approach to engineering design are outlined. it is shown that in order to establish a scientific theory of design  the following aspects need to be studied and covered  the designer  the activity  the object  the context in which engineering design takes place  and the context of use of the resulting technical system. the current state of such theory is presented  together with discussions of related literature. design science is brought into connection with necessary development of computer aids.1995,wang  hunghsiang.,an approach to computer-aided styling,this paper discerns aspects of geometric algorithms in styling  and investigates their automation. an approach to computer-aided styling  including morphology  geometric transformation  and interpolation  is presented and implemented in the design of a toolkit for car emergencies. the result reflects that this approach is useful for generating a great number of alternative shapes in conjunction with geometric algorithms  though it is still highly dependent on the designer s heuristic decision-making.1990,ward  a.,ideology  culture and the design studio,this paper seeks an overall framework to encompass the disparate range of influences on complex technical design projects. technical and institutional views of organizational processes are examined. it is argued that conflict between the rationalities appropriate to institutional and task environments produces inconsistency and suboptimization. to be successful the design activity must address both orientations. the development of the nasa space transportation system is used to illustrate this argument  and a metatechnical framework is advocated as necessary to the successful linking of task and institutional perspectives.1989,ward  anthony.,phenomenological analysis in the design process,drawing parallels between teaching and designing  the author suggests improvements for teaching design and analyses why teachers are selective in their choice of new teaching ideas.1987,ward  tony.,design archetypes from group processes,presents the results of a survey organized by the design methodology unit of the polish academy of sciences in 1984-85  which reveal the state of research in design and the applied sciences in europe  north america  australia  japan and china.1989,whitefield  andy  warren  clive.,a blackboard framework for modelling designersâ€™ behaviour,the torsion catapult was designed by the ancient greeks c. 370 b.c. the design they used was sophisticated  but poor in the strain it placed on the sinew cord and on the frame itself. the author states that the design could have been improved by the understanding and application of certain design principles  such as clarity of function  matching or the principle of short direct force paths. the use of principles in design is not simply an intellectual exercise  but one which can lead to stronger and more efficient models  as the consideration of the greek torsion catapult reveals.2011,wiegers  tjamme  langeveld  lau  vergeest  joris.,shape language  how people describe shapes and shape operations .,this research investigates which terms designers use to exteriorise and communicate shape. an experiment was devised for two test subjects  who both receive a picture of a shape. subject a receives  in addition  a picture that is said to be a modified version of the initial one. subject a is asked to explain the modified shape to b  who sketches it. the shape terms used are registered and categorised. the research method is described in detail and the observed terms are presented. the most frequently used categories of terms were locations  courses  shape_characteristics  values and shape_instantiations. we observed differences in the use of shape terms between subjects with distinct educations. we discuss implications of the results for design support systems. (author abstract)2010,wild  peter j  mcmahon  chris  darlington  mansur  liu  shaofeng  culley  steve.,a diary study of information needs and document usage in the engineering domain.,engineering design  despite its technical mechanical and mathematical foundations  is heavily informational. many authors have used information as the focus of their research  in contrast  our study examined both information needs and document usage by engineers. after reviewing the design decisions behind the diary study  we report on the analysis of the data. we also used the data to generate new  document use  scenarios  and  proof of concept  test of a related software system. as with all research methods  diary studies have a number of strengths and weaknesses so we also provide some reflections on the use of diary studies as a method for examining the engineer s use of documents in the engineering domain. (author abstract)1988,willem  raymond a.,on knowing design,describes a one-year pilot study on design and its contribution to business performance. the authors outline the results of the study  and a further two-year study to follow. the study aimed to examine formal and informal uses of design in business practices  and to suggest ways of making formal approaches more effective. two types of design were found to operate in all organizations studied. the first was overt  planned design carried out by designated designers. the other  termed `silent design   was the unconscious and unrecognized design contribution made by people who were unaware of their design activities. the wider  two-year study will investigate the scope and impact of this silent design on formal design activity.1990,willem  raymond a.,design and science,in this paper the author illustrates how teaching  and particularly teaching the subject of architecture  is not simply a job  but a way of life  through which the boundaries between home  work and self development become dissolved. he describes a number of his past projects at the welsh school of architecture which have addressed contemporary issues  but have also helped him as an individual to enquire into alternative ways forward. in this paper the author illustrates how teaching  and particularly teaching the subject of architecture  is not simply a job  but a way of life  through which the boundaries between home  work and self development become dissolved. he describes a number of his past projects at the welsh school of architecture which have addressed contemporary issues  but have also helped him as an individual to enquire into alternative ways forward. [author s abstract}2010,wilson  jamal o  rosen  david  nelson  brent a  yen  jeannette.,the effects of biological examples in idea generation.,in engineering design  analogies can be used in conceptual design to aid in generating new and novel design ideas. in this paper  a cognitive study was performed to assess the impact of biological examples  which serve as surface dissimilar analogies  in the idea generation process during conceptual design. in this study  participants were exposed to biological examples during the idea generation process. these results were then compared to those of participants receiving no examples and to those receiving human-engineered examples. the results suggest that exposure to biological examples in idea generation can increase the novelty of design ideas generated after exposure without inhibiting the variety of the design ideas generated  unlike human-engineered examples which resulted in decreased variety. (author abstract)2009,wong  franky w h  lam  patrick t i  chan  edwin h w.,optimising design objectives using the balanced scorecard approach .,there are difficulties in designing buildings to satisfy various design objectives which could be abstract  ill-defined and conflicting. furthermore  as design objectives are usually interrelated or even competing  optimisation amongst different objectives becomes necessary. in this paper  an optimisation approach for design management has been developed by adapting the balanced scorecard methodology  as a versatile aid to existing practice of priortising clients  requirements. the adapted balanced scorecard translates design objectives into actionable goals and measures  which make it easier for designers to ensure efficient and effective designs. the proposed balanced scorecard approach was considered in a focus group meeting as being capable of facilitating communication between the clients and design professionals  and serving the purpose of optimising various design objectives. (author abstract)2010,wong  joseph f.,the text of free-form architecture  qualitative study of the discourse of four architects .,one of the major developments in architecture in the past twenty years is the liberation of formal expression and organisation in architecture to reflect the heterogeneous nature of our current cultures and contexts. antithetical to the hegemony of modernist formalism  this  free-form architecture  is characterised by a free-flowing expression that seeks to simultaneously reflect and reconcile the inevitability of a diversity of forces influencing any architectural design. despite its proliferation  there seems to be a lack of rigorous research on the types of factors that these architects consider during their process of design  which would provide a better understanding on the diverse range of design considerations behind the provocative architectural forms. this study adopts the well established qualitative research methodology of grounded theory to examine the architects  own discourse to establish a hierarchical structure of factors of free-form architecture from this primary source of data. (author abstract)1993,yan  min.,representing design knowledge as a network function  behaviour and structure,the author proposes a memory-based representation for design knowledge (with a view to artificial intelligence applications).2010,yang  maria c.,consensus and single leader decision-making in teams using structured design methods.,decision-making in teams can be accomplished by including varying levels of team member opinion. this study considers two styles of group decision-making  consensus building and single leader decision-making with input from the team  in structured design selection tasks. the role of decision-making style in the speed of decision-making  team member satisfaction  and decision quality are examined. in this study  single leader was found to be faster than consensus. however  single leader was not rated by teams as faster  suggesting that perception of speed may be more important than actual speed. it was also found that when there was more ambiguity in a decision  as represented by a smaller point spread between choices  teams tended to rate speed and process quality lower. (author abstract)2006,ye  j.  campbell  r i  page  t  badni  k s.,an investigation into the implementation of virtual reality technologies in support of conceptual design,virtual reality (vr) technologies provide novel and enhanced modes of human computer interaction that can be used to overcome communication drawbacks that prevail in conventional computer aided design (cad) systems in the support of conceptual design  principally in concept generation and evaluation. the work reported here focuses on how vr technologies can proffer more natural and intuitive interaction between the designer and the cad system thus enabling a rapid and more straightforward approach to concept design creation and evaluation. as the result of this research  an innovative conceptual design system called the lucid system has been developed. lucid provides designers with a new interaction paradigm that enables them to take fuller advantage of their visual  auditory and tactile sensorial channels in order to create  view  touch  manipulate and listen to cad digital models more effectively. the lucid system has shown particular human computer interface (hci) benefits to designers during conceptual design stages based on the outcome from a user evaluation test. (author abstract)2011,yilmaz  seda  seifert  colleen m.,creativity through design heuristics  a case study of expert product design .,research has shown that cognition often relies on simplified heuristics  however  few studies have explored the role of heuristics in design. we propose that designers utilize specific heuristics to explore the problem space of potential concepts  leading to the generation of novel and creative solutions. design heuristic use in the early stages of product conception was examined through a case study of an expert industrial designer working on a real-world project. sequences of exploratory concept sketches were analyzed for evidence of design heuristic use in generating concepts. this case study uncovers design heuristics that promote variation in concepts and alter existing solutions  supporting the claim that expertise incorporates the use of heuristics to maximize creativity and diversity in designs. (author abstract)2007,you  hsiao-chen  chen  kuohsiang.,applications of affordance and semantics in product design,this paper aims to clarify the concept and elucidate the role of affordances in the interaction design for physical products by making a parallel comparison to product semantics. this study argues that the core of affordance concept in design lies not in expressing the design intent  but constructing the actions required in the userproduct interaction. a framework consisting of three design dimensions  affordance  perceptual information  and symbol  is suggested to deal with different aspects in physical interaction design  in particular  the motor  perceptual  and cognitive factors with an illustrative example. in conclusion  implications for interaction design and future research are suggested. (author abstract)2011,youmans  robert j.,the effects of physical prototyping and group work on the reduction of design fixation .,innovation is important for successful designs  but design fixation likely prevents designers from reaching their innovative potential. participants in this study were 120 students  80 of which had design backgrounds. participants saw an example tool  and then worked alone or in small groups to design two new tools using a construction set. all participants designed two tools  one in a physical prototyping environment and one in an environment without physical prototyping. results showed that designs were better and contained fewer fixations to the example tool when designed in the physical prototyping environment  but that groups designed better tools than individuals or nominal groups when no physical prototyping was available. these results underscore the importance of physical prototyping in design. (author abstract)2007,zamenopoulos  theodore  alexiou  katerina.,towards an anticipatory view of design,anticipation indicates the capacity to act in preparation for a certain effect or future state of the world. although the link between anticipation and design has not received particular attention in design research  it is a fundamental one. in the paper we review the concept of anticipation and discuss its meaning for design research. we further argue that in order to develop an anticipatory view of design it is necessary to move beyond long-established paradigms and abstractions such as those of machine  evolution and control. based on a conceptual and methodological framework proposed by robert rosen we elaborate such an anticipatory view that establishes the uniqueness of design compared to these paradigms.
