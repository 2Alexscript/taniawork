  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of giving two
      doses of denileukin diftitox (DD) at days 0 and 21 post autologous stem cell transplantation
      in a dose escalation fashion. Secondary goals include evaluating the the effect of DD on the
      number and percentage of T-regs in the peripheral blood post transplant at each dose level,
      the effect of DD on T cell (CD4/CD8) reconstitution post transplant at each dose level and
      determining the time to engraftment: absolute neutrophil count (&gt;0.5 x 10^9/L for 3
      consecutive days), and platelet (&gt;20X 10^9/L for 3 consecutive days).

      The hypothesis for the study is based on the ability of DD to deplete T-regs and
      subsequently enhance the immune reconstitution and reverse post transplant lymphopenia. This
      may indirectly enhance the efficacy of autologous transplantation and reduce disease
      relapse.

    <description>After receiving their stem cell transplant on Day 0, participants will receive study agent via a 30 minute infusion. Participants will also receive a 30 minute infusion of study agent on Day 21.
Follow-up visits for clinical assessment, blood draws for routine clinical laboratory studies and for immuno-correlative studies will also take place on days 42, 90, 180 and 360.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients age &gt; =18 who have been diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma and are scheduled for
        autologous peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) will be screened
        for eligibility.

        Patients must fulfill all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for this
        study:
