      RATIONALE: Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.
      Giving vorinostat together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat and
      to see how well it works when given together with radiation therapy followed by maintenance
      therapy with vorinostat in treating younger patients with newly diagnosed pontine gliomas.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To estimate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) or recommend a phase II dose of vorinostat
           given concurrently with radiotherapy in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed
           intrinsic pontine gliomas.

        -  To define and describe the toxicities of vorinostat given concurrently with
           radiotherapy in these patients.

        -  To determine, in the context of a this phase I/II trial, the antitumor activity of
           combining vorinostat with radiotherapy followed by maintenance vorinostat for 12
           courses in these patients, as measured by 12-month event-free survival and overall
           survival.

        -  To determine the toxicities of vorinostat for 12 additional courses after completion of
           concurrent vorinostat and radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To measure non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) activity in peripheral blood mononuclear
           cells (PBMCs) before treatment, at 2 weeks after starting vorinostat and radiotherapy,
           and at the end of radiotherapy.

        -  To measure HDAC2 levels and assess histone acetylation in PBMCs before treatment, at 2
           weeks after starting vorinostat and radiotherapy, and at the end of radiotherapy.

        -  To quantify DNA repair proteins from the NHEJ and homologous recombination repair
           pathways in tumors by either Western analysis or IHC, if paraffin-embedded tumor is
           available.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of vorinostat followed by a
      phase II study.

      Patients receive vorinostat orally or IV on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-40.
      Patients undergo 3D-conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy 5 days per week for 6
      weeks.

      Patients then receive maintenance therapy comprising oral vorinostat on days 1-28. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Blood and tumor samples may be collected periodically for correlative studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.
