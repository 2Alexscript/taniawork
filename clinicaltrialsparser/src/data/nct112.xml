  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study involves the use of a targeted form of radiation, in addition to standard high
      dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma.  The use of targeted
      radiation is designed to kill more multiple myeloma cells while avoiding the side effects of
      standard radiation.  This type of targeted radiation (also known as radioimmunotherapy) has
      been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of a related
      disease, lymphoma under the trade name, Zevalin©.  Zevalin© has been added to high dose
      chemotherapy and stem cell transplants for patients with lymphoma and is now being studied
      in this clinical trial for patients with multiple myeloma.  This trial is only available at
      Tufts Medical Center.

      The proposed clinical trial will test whether CD20-targeted radio-immunotherapy can be safe
      and effective when integrated into a standard regimen of myeloablative chemotherapy and
      autologous stem cell rescue in patients with measurable disease prior to high dose
      chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma.

    <textblock>
      Patients with multiple myeloma measurable disease following stem cell mobilization with
      institution standard high dose cyclophosphamide and peripheral blood stem cell collection
      are candidates for participation on this trial.  90Y Zevalin targets CD20 expressed on the
      surface of mature B-cells and is FDA approved for relapsed/refractory low grade lymphoma.
      This is a single arm, phase II safety and efficacy study of 90-Y Zevalin in multiple
      myeloma.  Subjects will receive cold antibody (Rituximab 100mg/m2) followed by 5 mCi test
      dose of 111-In Zevalin on transplant day -21.  Gamma camera images are obtained 48 to 72
      hours after 111-In Zevalin  to document appropriate / expected distribution of radiotracer.
      On transplant day -14, subjects will receive another cold antibody dose followed by 90Y
      Zevalin 0.4 mg/kg (max 32 mCi) as single dose.  Subjects are admitted for transplant on day
      -3 and proceed with institution standard high dose melphalan (200mg/m2) on day -2.  Subjects
      are followed for safety for 6 weeks after transplant.

    <description>For efficacy, the objective response rate (CR + PR) at 12 and 104 days following radioimmunotherapy will be determined. For safety, the rate of occurrence of defined toxic events including non-engraftment and unacceptable biodistribution of 90Y Zevalin occurring by day +42 following transplant will be determined.  The intervention will be considered safe if the rate of toxic events is less than 20%.</description>

    <description>1.5mg of 111In Zevalin (containing 5 mCi of 111In) will be used for radioimaging. 111In Zevalin will be administered by a 10 minute slow IV push injection immediately following completion of the rituximab infusion. 111In Zevalin may be injected by stopping the flow from the IV bag and injecting the radiolabeled antibody directly into the IV line. A 0.22 micron filter must be on line between the drug infusion port and the patient. The line must be flushed with at least 10cc of normal saline after 111In Zevalin has been injected.</description>
