  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MultiStem(r) is a new biological product, manufactured from human stem cells obtained from
      adult bone marrow or other nonembryonic tissue sources.

      Factors expressed by MultiStem cells are believed to reduce inflammation and regulate immune
      system function, protect damaged or injured cells and tissue, promote formation of new blood
      vessels, and augment tissue repair and healing.  MultiStem cell treatment resulted in
      significant efficacy in a mouse model of Graft versus Host Disease with almost complete
      reversal of gastrointestinal pathology (similar to pathology that would be expected in
      Ulcerative Colitis).  These data, together with safety data generated in 2 other clinical
      trials, suggest that MultiStem has the potential to be a new treatment option for patients
      with ulcerative colitis.

      This is the first study of MultiStem in this patient population and will cautiously explore
      the safety/toleration and potential benefit of this new treatment in patients with moderate
      to severe disease.
