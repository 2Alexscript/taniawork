      RATIONALE: Genetically-modified NSCs that convert 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) into the
      chemotherapy agent 5-FU at sites of tumor in the brain may be an effective treatment for
      glioma.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies genetically-modified NSCs and 5-FC in patients
      undergoing surgery for recurrent high-grade gliomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of intracerebral administration of NSCs in
      combination with oral 5-FC in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of
      5-FC and 5-FU with increasing NSC dose level.

      II. To non-invasively assess the presence of 5-FU in the brain with the use of 19F-MRS.

      III. To assess for the possible development of immunogenicity against the NSCs.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a dose-escalation study.

      At the time of surgery to resect tumor, study patients receive injections of genetically
      modified NSCs directly into brain tissue on day 0. Patients then take oral 5-FC every 6
      hours during days 4-10 which is converted to 5-FU in the brain by the NSCs.

      Follow-up MRIs of the brain are performed on days 32, 60, and every 2 months thereafter to
      assess for response and side effects.
