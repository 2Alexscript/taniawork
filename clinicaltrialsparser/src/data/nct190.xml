      RATIONALE: A computer-guided glucose management system may help manage glucose levels in
      patients who have undergone blood or bone marrow transplant.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying computer-guided glucose management systems in
      treating patients with hyperglycemia who have undergone blood and bone marrow transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether using CGGMS algorithms in non-critically ill BMT adult (age &gt;= 18
      years) patients, can control glucose within or close to current University of Washington
      Medical Center (UWMC) intensive care unit (ICU) targets.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare two different CGGMS tools to see which reaches glycemic targets and which
      receives better nursing satisfaction.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive blood glucose management with IV insulin using EndoTool.

      GROUP II: Patients receive blood glucose management with IV insulin using Glucommander.
