  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on preclinical (animal) studies showing that infusing bone
      marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells into the spinal fluid may contribute to improving
      neurologic function in animal models with spinal cord injuries.  Bone marrow (BM) contains
      several types of stem cells that can produce functional cells.  This includes cells that
      could help the healing process of damaged neurologic tissue.

      The primary objective of this study is to see if the injection of these cells, obtained from
      your own bone marrow, is safe.  A secondary objective is to evaluate if the treatment can
      provide functional improvements (neuromuscular control and sensation) in the affected areas.

      A Phase I, single-center trial to assess the safety and tolerability of an intrathecal
      infusion (lumbar puncture) of autologous, ex vivo expanded bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
      stem cells in a well-defined population of spinal cord injury patients.

      Safety will be evaluated by neurological and non-neurological tests performed after
      short-term (1 to 30 days) and long-term (2 to 12 months)follow-up evaluation periods after
      cell infusion.
