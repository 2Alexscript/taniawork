  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alefacept is a drug tht may reduce the number of T cells in circulation.  This drug has been
      used in the treatment of psoriasis, which is a skin disorder also caused by T cells, like
      chronic GVHD. Information from studies in psoriasis and in other patients with GVHD suggests
      that this drug may help to treat chronic GVHD.  Chronic GVHD is a medical condition that can
      develop after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.  It occurs when the donor immune cells
      (the &quot;graft&quot;) attack and damage organs and tissue (the &quot;host&quot;).  It is thought that T cells,
      a subtype of immune cells, are responsible for the tissue damage in chronic GVHD.  In this
      research study we are looking to see how well Alefacept works in treating chronic GVHD that
      has not resolved after therapy with corticosteroids.

      -  During the first week of treatment, participants will receive 2 doses of Alefacept
           intravenously (Day 1 and Day 4).  During weeks 2-12, Alefacept will be given
           subcutaneously once weekly.

        -  On weeks 1, 2 and every other week through Week 12 of study treatment, participants
           will have a physical exam, blood tests, and be asked general health and specific
           questions about any problems they may be having.

        -  Every other week, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their
           physical symptoms, activity level and emotional well being.
