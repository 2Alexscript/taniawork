      This study is designed as a pilot double cord study evaluating the safety and efficacy of
      transplantation of NiCord, umbilical cord-derived ex vivo expanded stem and progenitor
      cells, in combination with a second, unmanipulated cord blood unit in patients with
      hematological malignancies. The main study hypothesis is that co-transplantation of NiCord
      and an unmanipulated cord blood unit in patients with hematological malignancies following
      myeloablative therapy, will be safe and well tolerated.

    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative
      procedure for a number of hematological malignancies, bone marrow failure syndromes and
      inherited metabolic disorders. The application of allogeneic HSCT is limited by donor
      availability such that only approximately one-third of otherwise appropriate candidates have
      suitably matched family donors. Alternative donors include mismatched family members or
      matched unrelated donors, but these approaches are often complicated by an increased risk of
      graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and a prolonged and cumbersome search and procurement
      processes. In addition, far fewer subjects of racial minorities find suitable human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors.

      Umbilical cord blood has been increasingly used as an alternative source of stem cells and
      has extended the availability of allogeneic HSCT to patients who would otherwise not be
      eligible for this curative approach. In the last decade the number of cord blood
      transplantations from related and unrelated donors has increased dramatically. It is
      estimated that more than 20,000 patients have undergone cord blood transplantation from
      unrelated donors to date for a variety of genetic, hematological, immunological, metabolic
      and oncologic disorders. The major advantages of cord blood transplantation include easy
      procurement, no risk to donors, reduced incidence of transmitting infections, immediate
      availability, and reduced risk of acute GvHD in the setting of donor-recipient HLA mismatch.
      Nevertheless, the low cell dose remains a main limitation of this cell source leading to
      delayed hematopoietic reconstitution, higher risk of graft failure and relatively high
      treatment related mortality rates as compared to other hematopoeitic cell sources. To
      improve outcomes and extend applicability of cord blood transplantation, one potential
      solution is ex vivo expansion of cord blood-derived stem and progenitor cells.

      The sponsor has undertaken to develop NiCord, which is based on a novel technology for ex
      vivo cell expansion of cord blood derived hematopoietic progenitor cells. By increasing the
      number of short and long-term reconstitution progenitor cells transplanted, NiCord has the
      potential to enable broader application of umbilical cord blood transplantation, and improve
      its clinical outcomes in subjects with high-risk hematological malignancies.

      The main objective of the current study is to evaluate the safety of co-transplantation of
      NiCord and an unmanipulated cord blood unit to patients with hematological malignancies
      following myeloablative therapy. The study is designed as a pilot double cord study and
      consists of 3 phases:

        1. Screening phase - during this phase the patient undergo clinical assessment and
           screening tests to check his/her eligibility for the study. Once the patient is found
           eligible, the cord blood unit that was carefully selected for the patient in advance,
           enters the cell expansion process.

        2. Conditioning phase - during this phase the patient is treated with the myeloablative
           conditioning regimen and GvHD prophylaxis.

        3. Transplantation and follow-up -  includes transplantation of NiCord and the second,
           unmanipulated cord blood unit, and post-transplant supportive care and follow-up.
