      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and determine the optimal dose of a new
      drug, OMP-21M18, when given in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed, a standard drug
      treatment regimen for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Participants must
      not have received prior chemotherapy for their NSCLC.  OMP 21M18 is a humanized monoclonal
      antibody (a protein made in the laboratory) developed to target cancer stem cells.  The way
      the body handles OMP 21M18 will also be investigated.

      Up to 32 participants, 21 years or older, at up to 6 centres in Australia and New Zealand,
      will receive intravenous infusions of carboplatin and pemetrexed every 21 days, for up to 6
      cycles.  OMP-21M18 will be administered by intravenous infusion once every 21 days (on the
      same day as the scheduled carboplatin and pemetrexed administration) until disease
      progression. Participants who complete the 6 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and
      OMP-21M18 and who have stable disease or a response may continue to receive OMP-21M18 once
      every 21 days as maintenance therapy until there is evidence of disease progression. Disease
      status will be assessed every 8 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current cancer therapies often produce an initial reduction in tumour size but may not have
      longterm benefits. One possible explanation for this is the presence of cancer cells known
      as cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells represent a small part of the tumour but are
      believed to be responsible for much of the growth and spread of the cancer. They may also be
      more resistant to traditional therapy, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and determine the optimal dose of a new
      experimental drug, OMP21M18, when given in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed, the
      standard of care for patients with nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). OMP 21M18
      is a humanized monoclonal antibody (a protein made in the laboratory) and was developed to
      target cancer stem cells. The way the body handles OMP 21M18 will also be investigated.

      In this Phase I study, up to 32 participants, 21 years or older, will be enrolled at up to 6
      centres in Australia and New Zealand. Following informed consent and screening, participants
      will receive intravenous infusions of carboplatin and pemetrexed once every 21 days for up
      to 6 cycles. OMP21M18 will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion once every 21 days
      (on the same day as the carboplatin and pemetrexed administration). Participants who
      complete 6 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and OMP21M18 and who have stable disease or a
      response may continue to receive OMP21M18 once every 21 days as maintenance therapy. The
      first 6 participants will receive OMP21M18 5mg/kg every 21 days, the next 6 participants
      will receive10 mg/kg every 21 days, and the final 6 participants will receive 15 mg/kg every
      21 days. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the data for the 6 participants
      at each dose level after the last participant in that group has been treated for 56 days and
      decide whether it is safe to move to the next highest dose level. After confirming the
      optimum dose, 14 additional participants will be treated at the highest dose level that the
      DSMB considers safe.

      Participants will be assessed for disease status every 8 weeks and for safety at every visit
      and for 30 days after the end of study drug treatment. Safety will be assessed by adverse
      event monitoring, physical examination, vital signs, blood tests, cardiac monitoring, and
      participant interview. Response rates, duration of response, time to progression, and
      survival will be evaluated, requiring CT or MRI scans and CEA (tumour marker) levels at
      baseline and then every 8 weeks. The development of antibodies to treatment will be assessed
      throughout the study and up to 12 weeks after the end of study drug treatment. During the
      study blood samples will be taken to assess whether OMP21M18 is producing desired changes to
      the genes and proteins related to the cancer (biomarkers).

      The study includes an optional part which will investigate how variations in people's
      genetic makeup affect their response to medications. This involves the collection of one
      blood sample just before participants receive their first dose of study treatment. DNA will
      be extracted from the blood sample for testing.

    <description>The 6 subjects in the first cohort will receive OMP-21M18 5 mg/kg once every 3 weeks; the 6 subjects in the subsequent cohort will be treated with 10 mg/kg once every 3 weeks; and the 6 subjects in the final cohort will be treated with 15 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the data for the 6 subjects in each dose cohort after the last subject in that cohort has been on study for 56 days and then decide whether it is safe to escalate to the next highest dose cohort. Once the dose-escalation portion of the study has been completed, 14 additional subjects will be treated at the highest dose level that the DSMB deems as safe.</description>
