      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      O6-benzylguanine may help temozolomide work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to
      the drug. Giving genetically modified peripheral blood stem cells during or after treatment
      may prevent side effects caused by chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies O6-benzylguanine and temozolomide in combination with
      genetically modified peripheral blood stem cells in treating patients with newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of introducing and expressing P140K MGMT cDNA from a
           lentiviral-based provirus in autologous hematopoietic stem cells harvested from GBM
           patients.

        -  To assess the safety associated with infusion of autologous hematopoietic stem cells
           transduced ex vivo with a lentiviral vector expressing P140K MGMT in patients with GBM.

      Secondary

        -  To determine whether any patients who receive P140K MGMT-transduced CD34 cells tolerate
           O6-benzylguanine (BG) and dose-escalated temozolomide (TMZ) without myelosuppression.

        -  To evaluate the ability to detect P140K-transduced BG and TMZ-resistant hematopoietic
           cells from the bone marrow and peripheral blood in patients infused with
           P140K-transduced CD34 progenitors.

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of in vivo enrichment of P140K-expressing hematopoietic
           cells by repeated treatments of BG and TMZ at doses that appear therapeutic for GBM.

        -  To evaluate tumor response, progression-free survival, and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment cohorts.

        -  Cohort 1 (LV P140K MGMT gene transfer after concurrent chemoradiotherapy): Patients
           receive concurrent radiotherapy 5 days a week and oral temozolomide (TMZ) daily for 6
           weeks. Patients then undergo cell reinfusion of autologous P140K MGMT-transduced
           hematopoietic cells over 5-10 minutes at week 7. Beginning 4 weeks later, patients
           receive O6-benzylguanine (BG) IV over 1 hour on days 1-28 and oral TMZ on days 1-5.
           Treatment with BG and TMZ repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Cohort 2 (LV P140K MGMT gene transfer prior to concurrent chemoradiotherapy): Patients
           receive BG IV over 1 hour and a single dose of oral TMZ 2-3 days prior to reinfusion of
           autologous P140K MGMT-transduced hematopoietic cells over 5-10 minutes on day 0.
           Patients then undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week and receive concurrent BG daily and
           TMZ 5 days a week beginning on days 28 and 56. Beginning on day 56, treatment with BG
           and TMZ repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Cohort 3 (intra-patient dose escalation of TMZ in patients with evidence of
           P140K-marked cells [using the preferred treatment schema determined from Cohorts 1 and
           2 above]): After completion of radiotherapy, patients receive BG and TMZ and undergo
           cell infusion as in cohort 1 (cohort 3a) or 2 (cohort 3b). TMZ dose may be increased,
           as tolerated, during the 6 courses after radiotherapy.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for replication-competent lentivirus detection and
      other laboratory biomarker studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for the first two
      years, every 6 months for years 2-5, and yearly thereafter.
