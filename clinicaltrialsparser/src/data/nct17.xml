    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the responses to 2 different doses of a drug called
      plerixafor in subjects with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL) who will receive an autologous stem

On the evening of Day 4, patients will  receive a fixed dose of plerixafor of 20mg administered by SC injection.On Day 5, patients receive a morning dose of G-CSF 10 μg/kg and then undergo apheresis approximately 10 to 11 hours after the dose of plerixafor (within 60 minutes after administration of G-CSF). Patients continue to receive an evening dose of plerixafor followed the next day by a morning dose of G-CSF and apheresis for up to a maximum of 4 aphereses or until ≥ 5 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg are collected.</description>
