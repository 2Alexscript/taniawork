  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children treated for a brain tumor (BT) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia         (ALL) show
      elevated rates of working memory impairment. Working memory (WM) is the ability to hold and
      manipulate information online; for example, when an individual mentally rehearses a phone
      number in order to dial it without writing it down.  A computer-based working memory
      intervention has been successful in children diagnosed with ADHD and stroke survivors.
      Individuals participating in the intervention showed improvements on working memory measures
      as well as more complex problem solving skills.  Neuroimaging (brain scans) conducted before
      and after training showed changes in brain activation suggestive of underlying changes in
      brain systems that support working memory. This study investigates the effectiveness of this
      computer-based working memory intervention for childhood cancer survivors.

    <textblock>
      Participants randomized to the intervention arm will complete the  computerized working
      memory training program.  This computer-based training program is completed in the home and
      requires approximately 30 minutes every weekday for five weeks.  The program software guides
      the child through eight rotating exercises each day, with increasing difficulty based on the
      child's level of performance.  Exercises train both visuospatial and verbal WM using
      child-friendly activities.  A research team member will serve as a coach who monitors weekly
      progress online and offers support through weekly phone calls with the study participants
      and their caregivers.  This individual will not complete post-intervention assessments to
      maintain study blind. A home computer with internet connection and speakers is required.  A
      laptop computer and/or wireless internet access will be provided to families whose only
      obstacle to participation is  lack of computer access or internet connectivity in the home
      setting. Families randomized to the WM intervention will complete a tutorial with study
      staff that provides instruction in using a computer, the internet and the WM training
      software.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the benefits of this working memory
      intervention in a sample of childhood cancer survivors and look at brain-based changes that
      may occur as the result of working memory intervention. To achieve this goal, we plan to
      study childhood cancer survivors randomly assigned to the working memory intervention or a
      passive waitlist.  Both groups will participate in cognitive testing pre-, post-, and six
      months post intervention.  Intervention participants will also partake in neuroimaging exams
      before and after the intervention.  Findings from this study have direct potential to
      support a nonpharmaceutical cognitive intervention for cancer survivors that is a safe and
      effective alternative to stimulant medications with great promise for improving quality of
      life.
