      RATIONALE: Decitabine may help myelodysplastic cells become more like normal stem cells.
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies differentiation therapy with decitabine in treating
      patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Demonstrate that differentiation therapy with DNMT1 depleting but
      non-DNA damaging doses of decitabine is efficacious and can be administered weekly for &gt; =
      12 months.  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess safety of the regimen. II. Retrospectively
      compare study and standard regimen clinical responses. III. Assess the ability of a
      pharmacodynamic assay that measures DNMT1 depletion in peripheral blood white blood cells to
      predict clinical responses to decitabine. IV. Assess PCR for aberrant methylation signature
      as an early marker of relapse. V. Identify biologic features of MDS that correlate with
      response to decitabine, thereby facilitating future patient selection. VI. In cases of
      relapse or resistance, assess the role of the enzyme CDA in altering decitabine metabolism
      and preventing DNMT1 depletion.  OUTLINE: INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive decitabine
      subcutaneously (SC) twice weekly for 4 weeks or thrice weekly until achieving bone marrow
      blasts &lt; 5%.   MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients then receive decitabine SC twice weekly for up to
      52 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.   After completion
      of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
