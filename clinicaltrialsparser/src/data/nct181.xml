      RATIONALE: Growth factors, such as palifermin, may prevent chronic graft-versus-host disease
      caused by donor stem cell transplant.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial studies palifermin in preventing chronic
      graft-versus-host disease in patients who have undergone donor stem cell transplant for
      hematologic cancer

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of palifermin on thymic function in patients at
      risk of chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD).

      II. To evaluate the tolerability of palifermin in patients at risk of chronic GVHD.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on whether they wish to receive
      palifermin or not.

      GROUP 1: Patients receive palifermin intravenously (IV) on days 1-3 in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP 2: Patients do not receive palifermin.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 7, 14, 21, and 28.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the proportion and numbers of T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC)-positive CD4 T cells in the blood</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks after administration of palifermin</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>TREC content in flow-sorted CD4 T cells will be evaluated by DNA amplification assays. Signal joint TRECs (sjTREC) resulting from TCRD deletion during TCRA rearrangement will be enumerated as a measure of thymic export. The absolute number of TREC-positive CD4 T cells will be estimated by multiplying the proportion of TREC-positive CD4 T cells by the absolute CD4 T cell count.</description>
