      This protocol provides expanded access to bone marrow transplants for children who lack a
      histocompatible (tissue matched) stem cell or bone marrow donor when an alternative donor
      (unrelated donor or half-matched related donor) is available to donate.  In this procedure,
      some of the blood forming cells (the stem cells) are collected from the blood of a partially
      human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched (haploidentical) donor and are transplanted into the
      patient (the recipient) after administration of a &quot;conditioning regimen&quot;. A conditioning
      regimen consists of chemotherapy and sometimes radiation to the entire body (total body
      irradiation, or TBI), which is meant to destroy the cancer cells and suppress the
      recipient's immune system to allow the transplanted cells to take (grow). A major problem
      after a transplant from an alternative donor is increased risk of Graft-versus-Host Disease
      (GVHD), which occurs when donor T cells (white blood cells that are involved with the body's
      immune response) attack other tissues or organs like the skin, liver and intestines of the
      transplant recipient. In this study, stem cells that are obtained from a partially-matched
      donor will be highly purified using the investigational CliniMACS® stem cell selection
      device in an effort to achieve specific T cell target values. The primary aim of the study
      is to help improve overall survival with haploidentical stem cell transplant in a high risk
      patient population by limiting the complication of GVHD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 0 (newborn) - 21 years

          -  Patient must have a malignant or non-malignant disease that can benefit from
             alternative stem cell transplantation according to standard practice guidelines.

          -  Patients with lymphoma or acute leukemia (except acute myeloid leukemia, AML) must be
             in remission at the time of transplant.

          -  Patients must lack a healthy human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical related donor.

          -  Recipient or authorized guardian must sign informed consent for this study.

          -  If recipient is female and of child-bearing age, negative pregnancy test.

          -  Patient must have a healthy, willing mismatched related or an unrelated donor who is:

               -  Able to receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and undergo
                  apheresis either through placement of catheters in antecubital veins or a
                  temporary central venous catheter,

               -  For Related donor: sibling, half-sibling, parent, cousin, aunt, uncle or
                  grandparent will all be considered eligible.

               -  For Related donor: HLA antigen genotypic match ≥ 4/8 and ≤ 7/8
                  (haplocompatible).

               -  For unrelated donor: 6/8 or 7/8 HLA antigen match (if two mismatches, they must
                  be at different loci).

               -  Complete medical history, physical and screening for infectious diseases that
                  are acceptable for donation.

               -  If donor is female and of child-bearing age, negative pregnancy test.

               -  Absence of anti-HLA antibodies in recipient directed against donor antigens.

               -  Donor must be willing to sign informed consent for this study. If donor is &lt; 18
                  years of age, donor must be willing to give assent and parents willing to sign
                  informed consent. For unrelated donors: The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)
                  will obtain informed consent for donor's apheresis product to be used in this
                  study.

             failure and a reduced intensity conditioning regimen is used.

          -  Creatinine clearance &lt;60 ml/min/1.72 m2; can be lower if a reduced intensity
             conditioning regimen is used.

             one second (FEV1), or forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt;60% of predicted or oxygen
             saturation (O2 sat) &gt; 94% on room air if unable to perform pulmonary function tests
             (PFTs); can be lower if a reduced intensity conditioning regimen is used.
