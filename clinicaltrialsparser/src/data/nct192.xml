  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is important for the care of patients undergoing stem
      cell transplantation. Stem cell transplants are used to treat blood cancers and bone marrow
      disorders. This involves the use of high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation to kill
      cancer cells; but this damages the marrow and blood system.  Blood stem cells are
      transplanted by infusing into the recipient and blood counts recover over 2-3 weeks. Before
      bone marrow recovery, RBCs are needed to support the patient. Higher hemoglobin in these
      high risk patients may have benefits such as better energy and organ function. However,
      research in other areas of medicine suggests that a higher red cell count may be dangerous.
      Taken together, it is unclear whether having a lower or higher red cell count is better for
      patients having a blood stem cell transplant.  The investigators plan to study this by
      randomly assigning patients having a transplant to be transfused with RBCs either at a
      higher or lower hemoglobin level. In this way, the investigators will be able to accurately
      find out if there are any benefits or harms in having a lower or higher red cell count
      during the recovery period after blood stem cell transplantation.

             1. Acute Leukemia, myeloid, lymphoid or biphenotypic in 1st, 2nd  remission or in
                relapse

             2. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in chronic, accelerated or blast phase

             3. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

             5. Myeloproliferative Disorder

             6. Lymphoma

             7. Myeloma

        3. All study patients must provide consent at least 1 day prior to scheduled HSCT and
           provide written informed consent.
