      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with
      acute myeloid leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the frequency of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that originates in CD33+
           precursors or in which uncontrolled growth is restricted to CD33+ precursors.

      OUTLINE: Cryopreserved acute myeloid leukemia cell samples are separated from endothelial
      cell by fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) and analyzed for X-chromosome inactivation
      patterns by cytogenetic/molecular analysis and/or Humara assay.
