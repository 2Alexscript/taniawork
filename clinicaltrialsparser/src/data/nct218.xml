      A growing number of studies highlight the potential of stem cell transplantation as a novel
      therapeutic approach for stroke in animal model. But the stem cell therapy for chronic
      stroke patients has not been well investigated yet. In this study, the investigators will
      test the hypothesis that intracerebral peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell (CD34+)
      (PBSC) transplantation induces neuroplasticity in chronic stroke patients. The remyelination
      of corticospinal tract in the lesion side, focal increased perfusion and increased cortical
      activity in the peri-infarcted area will be monitored by the functional MRI after stem cell
      therapy. The investigators study is aimed to find the potential mechanisms of the functional
      recovery after stem cell implantation. The investigators also hope to find image surrogate
      markers for prediction of patient outcome. The possible surrogate markers will be helpful in
      improving the treatment procedure and patient selection.
