      High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support is the current standard procedure
      in the first-line treatment in younger patients with myeloma fit for intensive treatment.
      Current practice in Switzerland for stem cell mobilization is the combination of
      chemotherapy and G-CSF stimulation in myeloma patients fit for high-dose chemotherapy with
      melphalan and autologous stem cell transplant. In this trial the intravenous application of
      Plerixafor is being investigated in respect of the capability of the mobilization of stem
      cells from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood. In contrast to the twice daily
      application of G-CSF (eg. Neupogen) for several days, Plerixafor has to be injected just
      one-time.

      Background

      High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support is the current standard procedure
      in the first-line treatment in younger patients with myeloma fit for intensive treatment.
      Current practice in Switzerland for stem cell mobilization is the combination of
      chemotherapy and G-CSF stimulation in myeloma patients fit for high-dose chemotherapy with
      melphalan and autologous stem cell transplant. For mobilization chemotherapy, a single dose
      of vinorelbine is commonly used, producing mild myelosuppression. G-CSF is started at day 4
      on a daily basis, allowing stem cell apheresis usually at day 8. In a subsequent study, we
      evaluated the use of pegylated G-CSF given as a single injection at day 4 together with
      vinorelbine. We found this regimen equally feasible, reliable and allowing collection of
      stem cells in an equally high percentage. In the current proposal, we suggest to continue
      this line of research investigating the mobilization using chemotherapy with vinorelbine. We
      propose to study the feasibility of this mobilization chemotherapy in the absence of growth
      factors, thus without G-CSF, in combination with Plerixafor.

      Objective

      Primary objective: To assess the feasibility of collection of &gt; 6 million CD34+ peripheral
      blood stem cells/kg body weight in 2 days.

      Secondary objectives: Assessment of safety of plerixafor during mobilization and collection
      of peripheral blood stem cells; feasibility of intravenous plerixafor application and stem
      cell apheresis in a one-day procedure on an ambulatory basis; evaluation of engraftment of
      peripheral blood stem cells mobilized by vinorelbine and plerixafor; evaluation of the costs
      for mobilization with plerixafor.

      Methods

      Chemotherapy with vinorelbine is given at a standard dose at day 1, on an ambulatory basis.

      In part A (10 patients), G-CSF is given s.c., divided in two daily doses starting at day 4
      until collection of stem cells. Plerixafor is given as an i.v. application on day 8 in the
      dose of 240 microg/kg b.w. Stem cell collection is initiated 4 hours later at day 8, if at
      least 20 x 103 of CD34+ cells / ml peripheral blood are detected. In case of insufficient
      collection, the procedure is repeated at day 9, including repetition of plerixafor
      application.

      Part B (30 patients): If the combination of plerixafor and vinorelbine is found feasible and
      in the absence of unexpected toxicity, additional 30 patients will be studied in part B of
      this study. No G-CSF will be administered in part B, otherwise the treatment plan is as it
      is in part A.

      High dose Melphalan will be used as conditioning regimen. After transplantation, G-CSF will
      be given to subjects starting at day +5 after PBPC reinfusion.

    <description>Plerixafor is a bicyclam with hematopoietic stem cell-mobilizing activity. Plerixafor blocks the binding of stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1alpha) to the cellular receptor CXCR4, resulting in hematopoietic stem cell release from bone marrow and HSC movement into the peripheral circulation.</description>
