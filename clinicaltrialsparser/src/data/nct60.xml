  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the experimental drug pralatrexate with the
      vitamins folic acid and vitamin B12 might be an effective treatment for head and neck
      cancer.  The reason we are doing this study is because another drug called methotrexate has
      been used for a long time to treat head and neck cancer patients.  Pralatrexate was designed
      by scientists to be a new drug that works better than methotrexate. Laboratory studies have
      shown that pralatrexate works better than methotrexate at killing cancer cells.

      Pralatrexate has already been studied in patients with other types of cancers, such as
      lymphoma and lung cancer. The results from those studies were promising.  Pralatrexate was
      recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a new treatment for a cancer
      called peripheral T cell lymphoma.

    <description>Patients will be treated with 30 mg/m2 of pralatrexate intravenously once weekly for 3 weeks in a 4 week cycle with vitamin supplementation. Patients will take 1.0-1.25 mg oral folic acid on a daily basis. Folic acid should be initiated during the 10-day period preceding the first dose of pralatrexate and dosing will be continued during the full course of therapy and for 30 days after the last dose of pralatrexate. Patients will also receive a vitamin B12 (1 mg) intramuscular injection no more than 10 weeks prior to the first dose of pralatrexate and every 8-10 weeks thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be given the same day as treatment with pralatrexate.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histopathologically confirmed recurrent and/or metastatic squamous
             cell carcinoma of the head and neck, including unknown primary squamous cell
             carcinomas of the neck. Confirmation of biopsy/diagnosis will be performed at MSKCC
             or at participating sites (NYU Cancer Institute/NYU Medical Center/ Bellevue Hospital
             Center).

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  ECOG performance status must be ≥ 0 or 1.

          -  Disease must be measurable by RECIST version 1.1 criteria.

          -  Patients must have been previously treated with systemic chemotherapy (i.e.,
             chemotherapy and/or targeted therapies such as cetuximab for recurrent/metastatic
             HNSCC,.
