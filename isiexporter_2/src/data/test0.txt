   GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS
AB Patients with symptoms of GERD and dyspepsia are among the most common
   consulters in general practice and are different from their
   counterparts in the community who choose not to consult although they
   suffer from similar symptoms, They represent a heterogeneous group with
   considerable symptom overlap. They have a relatively poor quality of
   life and endoscopic findings can only explain symptoms in about half of
   these patients. Thus psychosocial factors which could contribute to
   their morbidity should be explored. While some studies have
   methodological shortcomings, main findings are that key psychological
   factors are anxiety, tension, neuroticism, somatization, fears of
   malignancy, negative assessment of health, depression, a poor social
   network and less effective coping strategies. Physical illness is
   likely to bring on psychological distress due to discomfort or threat
   of ill health. Cognizance of psychosocial factors will facilitate an
   understanding of the underlying problems and will improve diagnosis and
   selection of optimal treatment.

AB We examine how two highly successful new biotechnology firms (NBFs)
   source their most critical input-scientific knowledge. We find that
   scientists at the two NBFs enter into large numbers of collaborative
   research efforts with scientists at other organizations, especially
   universities. Formal market contracts are rarely used to govern these
   exchanges of scientific knowledge. bur findings suggest that the use of
   boundary-spanning social networks by the two NBFs increases both their
   learning and their flexibility in ways that would not be possible
   within a self-contained hierarchical organization.

TI Accommodating plague in medieval Marseille
SO CONTINUITY AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB Marseille's rich notarial and judicial archives reveal that the city's
   residents accommodated the impact of the Black Death of 1348 in a
   variety of flexible and imaginative ways. Municipal institutions,
   notably the courts and the public notariate, handled the huge increase
   in their caseloads smoothly. Men and women easily rid themselves of
   devalued and unwanted property inherited from their decreased
   relatives. People also remade their relationships with other people, as
   marriages doubled or trebled and as immigrants settled into the fabric
   of the town. Those who survived the plague, therefore, knew how to
   recreate the social networks on which they depended for friendship,
   credit, and assistance, and the crisis itself highlights processes of
   accommodation characteristic of an open and flexible society.

AB This analysis sought to determine what factors differentiate between
   support group participants and non-participants among family members
   with a psychiatrically disabled relative. 225 families were interviewed
   with a structured interview that included demographic Information and
   questions about the psychiatric history of the ill relative. The
   interview also included measures of grief, burden, coping strategies
   self efficacy, mastery and social support. Logistic regression was used
   to compare participants to non-participants. Support group participants
   were more likely to be a parent with a higher functioning ill relative
   who has been ill for a longer period of time. Support group
   participants reported less subjective burden, smaller social networks,
   and greater utilization of adaptive coping strategies than
   non-participants.

TI Friendship quality as a predictor of young children's early school
   adjustment
SO CHILD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL NETWORKS; PERCEPTIONS; LONELINESS; PRESCHOOL; BEHAVIOR
AB The purpose of this study was to develop a method for assessing young
   children's perceptions of classroom friendships and to determine
   whether these perceptions were associated with their adjustment during
   the transition to grade school. Subscales tapping 5 friendship
   processes (e.g., validation, aid, disclosure of negative affect,
   exclusivity, conflict) were extracted from a 24-item friendship
   interview that was individually administered to 82 kindergarten
   children (M age = 5.61) who possessed a reciprocated and stable
   ''best'' friend in their classroom. Children's reports of the
   investigated friendship processes were found to be reliable, and
   processes such as perceived validation and conflict predicted
   children's satisfaction with their friendships, and the stability of
   these these relationships. Perceived conflict in friendships was
   associated with multiple forms of school maladjustment for boys,
   including higher levels of school loneliness and avoidance and lower
   levels of school liking and engagement. For both boys and girls,
   validation and aid forecasted gains in perceived support from
   classmates, and aid also predicted improvements in children's school
   attitudes. Perceived exclusivity in friendships was associated with
   lower levels of achievement. These findings, and others reported in
   this article, are consistent with the hypothesis that the relational
   features of children's classroom friendships yield psychological
   benefits or costs (e.g., provisions) that, in turn, affect their
   development and adjustment.

   interviewed three times during the two years following their transition
   to West Berlin. In moving to the west, the migrants had to deal with
   various stressors, among them the lack of social ties in their new
   environment. Fortunately, the number of their new friends increased
   steadily, and loneliness declined. These changes, however, differed
   between sexes and age groups. Men made more friends than women, in
   particular same-sex friends, whereas women knitted ties with both
   sexes. The young built larger networks than the intermediate age group.
   Loneliness emerged as an inhibiting factor in the bonding process. The
   study demonstrates how well these refugees coped with a social crisis.
   It also examines the roles that loneliness and social bonding played in
   the readjustment process.

AB Predictors of methadone maintenance treatment outcome have not been
   extensively studied as they relate to variations in program philosophy,
   nor have such predictors received much examination among recently
   treated, older cohorts of opioid addicts for whom drug use patterns
   have changed. Predictors of outcome were examined at 18 months
   post-treatment entry for 353 admissions to methadone maintenance who
   received random assignment to one of three counseling conditions: (1)
   medication only, (2) standard counseling and (3) enhanced services; and
   one of two contingency conditions: (1) no contingencies, and (2)
   contingency contracting in a six-cell 3 x 2 design. Subjects in
   contingency contracting conditions were placed on contingency contracts
   for positive urine toxicology results and ultimately discharged for
   unremitting drug use. All subjects completed the Addiction Severity
   Index (ASI) and provided weekly urine specimens. Predictors of
   urinalysis results and treatment retention were determined using
   bivariate and multivariate techniques. Interactions between subject
   characteristics by experimental condition assignment were also examined
   as predictors. Higher rates of total positive urine specimens were
   predicted by younger age, greater pre-treatment frequency of smoking
   cocaine, lower ASI psychiatric composite scores, and higher ASI legal
   composite scores. Higher rates of opiate positive specimens were
   predicted by younger age, lower pre-treatment frequency of alcohol
   intoxication, higher ASI legal and lower ASI employment and psychiatric
   composite scores, and assignment to medication only/no contingencies
   condition. Higher rates of cocaine positives were predicted by younger
   age, black race, lower ASI psychiatric composite score, greater
   pre-treatment frequency of intravenous and smoked cocaine use, less
   pre-treatment frequency of marijuana use, and lower methadone dose
   level. Assignment to enhanced/contingency contracting predicted lower
   rates of cocaine positives. Treatment retention was predicted by older
   age, non-black race, lower ASI legal composite score, higher methadone
   dose level and assignment to non-contingent conditions. While subject
   variables over which treatment providers have little control were,
   thus, related to outcome, type of treatment provided and methadone dose
   also influenced outcome.

AB This study examines macro and micro factors influencing the development
   of sense of community (Davidson & Cotter 1980) in two different
   populations (immigrants and veterans) in new temporary neighborhoods in
   Israel. At the macrolevel, the major factors examined were population
   size, population density, number of dwelling units in the site,
   urbanity of the area, ethnic heterogeneity, and peripheriality of the
   region. Three kinds of variables were examined on the microlevel: (a)
   personal attitudes: evaluation of the dwelling unit and satisfaction
   with public services; (b) social networks; and (c) sociodemographic
   characteristics. Data were collected from 242 immigrants from the
   former USSR and from 60 Israeli veterans, residing in 5 different
   sites. Two different patterns of predictors of sense of community
   emerged in the two different samples. In the veteran sample, only one
   macrolevel variable entered the stepwise analysis equation: the number
   of dwelling units in the site. In the immigrant sample, three
   significant microlevel factors entered the equation: evaluation of the
   dwelling unit, external network, and age. The data thus suggest that
   the major determinant factors underlying sense of community vary for
   different groups of people.

AB Public policy which controls and seeks to correct employment
   discrimination is now in its fourth decade in the USA. Organizations
   have made strides in complying with such policies through their hiring
   practices and in employee development and training programmes. While
   laws such as the Civil Rights Act and programmes such as EEO and AA
   have high aims and lofty claims, in practice they miss the mark in
   organizations. Research indicates that the nature of the work
   relationship is constrained by both network and hierarchical forms of
   organization. Suggests that policy is predicated only on the latter and
   that innovation may lie in the former. Finds that understanding and
   managing the networks in organizations may be used to augment existing
   programmes in achieving non-discriminatory or ''fair'' employment
   practices.

ID INFARCTION; TIME
AB Medical treatment of stroke is dependent on a narrow therapeutic time
   window. We prospectively analyzed the influence of demographic,
   medical, and pathophysiologic factors on admission delay in 1,197
   unselected, acute stroke patients. Twenty five percent were admitted
   within 3 1/2 hours, 35% within 6 hours, 50% within 14 hours, and 68%
   within 24 hours after stroke onset. Living alone (odds ratio [OR] 1.75,
   95% CI 1.3 to 2.3) and retired working status (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.01 to
   2.54) delayed admission. A well-working social network thus seems
   important to early admission. The milder the stroke, the higher was the
   risk of delayed admission (OR 1.25 per 10 points decrease in stroke
   severity [Scandinavian Neurological Stroke Scale score on admission],
   95% CI 1.14 to 1.3). A history of TIA increased the relative chance of
   early admission by odds 1.64 (95% CI 1.06 to 2.54). Other factors such
   as age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, other
   comorbidity, previous stroke, headache, aphasia, apraxia, anosognosia,
   neglect, lowered consciousness, mental status (Mini-Mental State
   Examination) and type of stroke (hemorrhage infarct) had no independent
   influence on admission time. Admission was markedly delayed in most
   patients. This represents a major barrier to medical treatment.
   Patients with the most severe strokes are admitted early, but patients
   with milder symptoms should also be encouraged to seek immediate
   admission. The observation that a history of TIA reduced admission time
   indicates that an increase in public awareness and knowledge may reduce
   delay and save precious time.

TI Tactics as units of analysis in personality psychology: An illustration
   using tactics of hierarchy negotiation
SO PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID 5-FACTOR MODEL; MANIPULATION; STRATEGIES; COGNITION; TAXONOMY; SELF
AB Two important recent trends in personality psychology have been a
   resurgence of traditional trait research (e.g. five factor model) and
   the emergence of personal goal-based approaches (e.g. life tasks,
   personal projects, and personal strivings). We propose that tactics are
   useful units of analysis that can provide a bridge between these two
   research movements. To illustrate this approach, we examined the
   tactics of hierarchy negotiation-the means by which individuals
   maintain or improve their relative position or status. Studies 1 (N=84)
   and 2 (N=212) identify 26 tactics of hierarchy negotiation that were
   represented by five major factors: Manipulation, Industriousness,
   Social Networking, Autonomy, and Aid Accrual. These factors show
   coherent links with personality characteristics represented by the
   five-factor model, with interpersonal dispositions, and with
   self-esteem. Moderate support was found for the predictive power and
   differential effectiveness of specific tactics of hierarchy
   negotiation. industriousness tactics such as Working Hard and
   Prioritizing Tasks significantly predicted outcome measures such as
   salary, academic degrees, and promotions. Five sex differences in
   tactic use emerged-Aid Accrual and Appearance Enhancement (used by
   women more) and Boasting, Aggressing, and Displaying Athleticism (used
   by men more) suggesting that women and men may select different tactics
   from their strategic arsenal. A longitudinal follow-up (Study 3, N=130)
   found that tactics of hierarchy negotiation at time 1 predicted salary,
   academic degrees, and promotions 4 years later. Discussion focuses on
   limitations of the current research, on the importance of hierarchy
   negotiation as a goal, and on the utility of tactics as units of
   analysis in personality psychology. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

AB Children's self reports of social groups were compared with the social
   groups identified by a consensus judgment of their peers. The subjects
   were 138 Chinese 4th grade students (mean age = 9.91) from a primary
   school and 167 Chinese 7th grade students (mean age = 13.09) from a
   secondary school, both located in Hong Kong. Following the Social
   Cognitive Map (SCM) procedure, students were asked to identify the
   social groups within their grades, including their own groups. The
   subjects also rated themselves on multiple domains of competence. Their
   teachers rated them on the same domains. Subjects tended to be biased
   toward self-enhancement when reporting their own groups: They omitted
   members who had low school scholastic rank and unfavorable scores on
   teacher ratings of competence. There was a strong effect of propinquity
   and gentler on group membership, in that all groups were comprised of
   children from the same classroom and virtually all (98%) of the same
   sex. Members scored similarly on teacher ratings of competence. In
   elementary school, conventional values and academic achievement
   provided the behavioral bases for peer group cohesion. By early
   adolescence, peer-related concerns supplemented rather than replaced
   conventional values as the bases for group cohesion.

AB Relationships with family and friends by 439 heroin addicts during the
   first 3 months of drug abuse treatment were examined in relation to
   behavioral improvements of clients. Family conflict and peer deviance
   were significant predictors of injection frequency and illegal activity
   during treatment, and reductions in family conflict were associated
   with lower drug use, injection frequency, and illegal activity during
   treatment These results provide support for treatment emphasis on
   helping clients reduce conflict among family members, improve
   dysfunctional relationships with peers, and replace deviant friendships
   with others that encourage treatment participation and conformance to
   social norms.

AB In general this comment tackles the problems and difficulties
   potentially combined with an application of formal economic models and
   constructs, such as the Walras equilibrium and microeconmic demand
   theory, to pure sociological contexts. In particular, this is done by
   analyzing a further attempt, as recently suggested by Braun (1993 and
   1994), to extend the well-known Coleman Model by incorporating the
   embeddedness of social transactions in incomplete social network
   structures. ''Pars pro toto'' it is proved that Braun's
   conceptualization contains some weaknesses which imply that fundamental
   conclusions drawn in his article have to be revised.

AB Social network analysis uses techniques from graph theory to analyze
   the structure of relationships among social actors such as individuals
   or groups. We investigate the effect of the layout of a social network
   on the inferences drawn by observers about the number of social
   groupings evident and the centrality of various actors in the network.
   We conducted an experiment in which eighty subjects provided answers
   about three drawings. The subjects were not told that the drawings were
   chosen from five different layouts of the same graph. We found that the
   layout has a significant effect on their inferences and present some
   initial results about the way certain Euclidean features will affect
   perceptions of structural features of the network, There is no ''best''
   layout for a social network; when layouts are designed one must take
   into account the most important features of the network to be presented
   as well as the network itself.

TI Attendance at cultural events, reading books or periodicals, and making
   music or singing in a choir as determinants for survival: Swedish
   interview survey of living conditions
SO BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPRESSION
AB Objectives-To investigate the possible influence of attendance at
   cultural events, reading books or periodicals, making music or singing
   in a choir as determinants for survival.
   Design-A simple random sample was drawn of 15 198 individuals aged
   16-74 years. Of these, 85% (12 982) were interviewed by trained
   non-medical interviewers between 1982 and 1983 about cultural
   activities. They were followed up with respect to survival until 31
   December 1991.
   Setting-Swedish interview survey of living conditions comprising a
   random sample of the adult Swedish population.
   Subjects-12 675 people interviewed between 1982 and 1983.
   Main outcome measures-Survival of subjects after controlling for eight
   confounding variables: age, sex, education level, income, long term
   disease, social network, smoking, and physical exercise.
   Results-6301 men and 6374 women were followed up; 533 men and 314 women
   died during this period. The control variables influenced survival in
   the expected directions except for social network for men; a
   significant negative effective was found when the analysis was made
   separately for men and women. We found an influence on mortality when
   the eight control variables were controlled for in people who rarely
   attended events compared with those attending most often, the relative
   risk being 1.57 (95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.09).
   Conclusion-Attendance at cultural events may have a positive influence
   on survival. Long term follow up of large samples with confounders that
   are well controlled for and with the cultural stimulation more highly
   specified should be used to try to falsify the hypothesis before
   experiments start.

AB The aim of this study is to examine the ways in which individuals'
   perceptions of media use are influenced by others. Traditional theories
   of media use have proposed that perceptions of media use are shaped by
   individuals' demographic characteristics and the media's
   characteristics. However three recent theories-critical mass theory
   social influence model of media use, and adaptive structuration
   theory-suggest that individuals' perceptions of media emerge as a
   result of their interaction with others in their social network.
   Results from a longitudinal study of 30 group decision support system
   (GDSS) groups and 25 non-GDSS groups over a 3-week period indicate that
   interactional influence was a better predictor of individuals'
   perceptions of media use than were individuals' demographic
   characteristics or characteristics of the media.

AB In a preschool setting, the naturally occurring aggressive behavior of
   sixty-four 4-year-old children was observed and recorded. Individual
   differences in gender, behavioral style, social competence, reciprocal
   friendship, and social clique membership were examined to understand
   how these variables might be related to children's aggressive behavior.
   Variations in children's aggressive behavior were found to be
   associated with behavior style and social competence with peers.
   Children within social cliques were relatively similar in the frequency
   of their observed aggressive behavior. The results suggest that efforts
   to decrease children's aggression might target groups of children
   rather than individuals.

AB Potential mediators of the modest association between retrospectively
   rated parental behaviour and adult affective symptoms in offspring were
   investigated in a national longitudinal study of a cohort followed to
   the age of 43. Personality measures from adolescence could account for
   a small part of this association. Personal relationships in adulthood
   were more strongly associated with both parental behaviour and
   symptoms: marital history, emotional support, social network and
   availability of help in a crisis. Poor parenting did not lead to a
   general vulnerability to later life events, and socio-economic status
   and financial hardship were not implicated in the link between parental
   behaviour and adult symptoms. However, parental affectionless control
   was associated with certain types of life stressors in adulthood, i.e.
   interpersonal as opposed to non-interpersonal life events.
   Collectively, aspects of personal relationships accounted for much of
   the elevated symptom levels in those rating parents as low on care or
   high on control. Findings were consistent with the notion that
   interpersonal competence is important in the continuity between
   childhood experience and adult mental health, but other possible
   interpretations are discussed.

AB The expression ''quality of life'' has a strong positive connotation.
   The definition will be influenced by values and points of reference.
   Not at least in the psychiatric domain we need a precise and not to
   wide-ranging definition. If we are to investigate the relation between
   living conditions or different psychiatric diagnoses, and people's
   subjective experience, we have to separate these sets of phenomena.
   Quality of life is related to individual feelings. It is subjective and
   includes a global assessment. It is seen as both a cognitive evaluation
   and some degree of positive and negative feelings. It correlates with
   depression but can be separated from it. Personality factors will
   influence quality of life, but it reacts to life changes and cannot be
   seen as synonymous with any particular trait. Quality of life
   measurements have shown that long-term psychiatric patients have lower
   well-being than others. They can also help us to weigh between
   different treatment programmes, and between patients and their social
   network.

ID RANDOMIZED TRIAL; SOCIAL SUPPORT; CARE; MATERNITY; RISK
AB A randomized controlled trial including 2235 women at high risk of low
   birthweight was conducted in four Latin American institutions. The
   objective of this trial was to evaluate a psychosocial support
   intervention during pregnancy aimed at improving perinatal health and
   mothers' psychosocial conditions. The core of the intervention was four
   to six home visits where emotional support, counseling and
   strengthening of the woman's social network was provided. Outcomes were
   measured at 36 weeks of pregnancy, post-partum and 40 days after
   delivery. The intervention was not successful in either altering
   women's perception of social support and satisfaction with the
   reproductive experience, as well as maternal and newborn's health care.
   It is concluded that although high levels of psychosocial distress
   during pregnancy may play an independent role in determining adverse
   pregnancy outcomes, this adverse effect does not appear to be
   ameliorated by psychosocial interventions conducted only during
   pregnancy, particularly those of a magnitude that can be realistically
   implemented (in content and frequency) at public care services in most
   developing countries. (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB The use of psychotropic drugs has been widely studied; however; few
   studies have focused on factors associated with psychotropic drug use
   among the elderly. The aim of this study war to analyze the
   relationship between sociodemographic variables, socioeconomic status
   social network, health, and physician visits and the use of
   psychotropic drugs among the elderly living at home. The study area was
   a municipality in mideastern Sweden with a population of about 21,000
   inhabitants. Data from interviews with and health assessments of
   noninstitutionalized people age 75 and older (N = 421) were linked to
   cut individual-bared research register of prescription drug purchases.
   There were no differences in psychotropic drug use between men and
   women or between different age groups. The multivariate analyses
   (LISREL) showed that mental health and physician visits were associated
   with psychotropic drug use. An indirect relationship was also found
   between psychotropic drugs and loneliness and chronic morbidity,
   respectively.

AB Back pain causes a considerable loss of working days as well as health
   care costs and therefore represents a major public health problem in
   industrialized countries. Psychosocial factors have received increasing
   attention from researchers studying the causal factors of non-specific
   back pain. However, most studies focus on few dimensions, like
   individual or work-related factors. We studied the simultaneous
   association of various factors representing psychosocial, behavioral,
   and health-related dimensions to self-reported back pain. Data from the
   Berne Workplace Health Project on 850 employed men and women was
   analyzed. Back pain was operationalized by a dichotomized variable
   (having suffered moderately to severely from back pain in the preceding
   four weeks). The theoretical model guiding the underlying project was a
   general demand-resource model. Variables that-according to that
   model-were hypothesized to be related to back pain as well as more
   specific factors-like physical work load-were analyzed by stepwise
   logistic regression analysis. in men, there was a statistical trend (P
   < 0.1) for several work-related factors (low job discretion, high job
   demands, low job satisfaction). In women, dissatisfaction with salary
   was the only work-related factor associated with back pain. There was
   no significant association between private context factors, like poor
   social network or high demands/low control, and back pain. Only in men,
   the likelihood of back pain increased with age, while only in women,
   back pain was associated with emotional problems (individual factors).
   Among the behavioral factors, smoking was associated to back pain in
   men, while in women none of the behavioral factors was significant. In
   both men and women reporting more than two functional symptoms and a
   history of intestinal problems were associated to back pain. All of our
   findings were in the expected direction, i.e. it was invariably
   unfavorable categories of explanatory variables that were associated
   with higher prevalence of back pain. However, most associations seem to
   be quite unspecific. There is a need for theoretically guided research
   aiming at the development of a more complex process model of back pain.

AB Family assistance helps many teenage or young unmarried mothers to cope
   with poverty and the challenges of childrearing. Kin support to young
   mothers, while beneficial, should not be romanticized. It also often
   entails conflict, stress, frustration, and disappointment due to
   interpersonal tensions, or conflicting interests, or relatives' limited
   ability to provide support. Nearly always the underlying issue is a
   discrepancy between the young mother's expectations and her support
   network's performance. We describe three sources of unrealistic
   expectations: relatives' initial reactions to her pregnancy, a history
   of early childbearing by relatives, and desires for a relationship with
   baby's father.

AB Objective. To assess structural social network characteristics and
   perceived loneliness in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) patients and
   healthy controls.
   Methods. A cross-sectional, retrospective, case-control design was
   employed using a structured interview and a self-report questionnaire.
   We studied 25 female FMS patients and 25 matched healthy female
   controls.
   Results. FMS patients had statistically significantly (P < 0.05) more
   intimate friends (mean 4.5) and more health care providers (mean 1.5)
   than did controls (2.3 and 0.0, respectively). The FMS patients more
   often initiated the contact with family members (mean 2.1) than did
   controls (mean 0.8). FMS patients did not perceive themselves as
   lonelier than controls perceived themselves. While there wets a
   significant negative correlation between loneliness and social network
   variables among the controls, this relationship was not significant
   among the FMS patients. Among the patients, there was a strong
   correlation between the total social network size and the number of
   intimate friends, whereas in controls, the mean number of acquaintances
   was strongly correlated with the total network size.
   Conclusion, Compared to healthy controls, the social networks of FMS
   patients presented more linkages with intimate friends, family members,
   and health care providers. The lack of correlation between loneliness
   and social network variables for FMS patients is not what might be
   expected from social support theory. The assessment of structural
   social network characteristics along with social support variables may
   add to our understanding of the social functioning of FMS patients.

ID GENDER DIFFERENCES; SOCIAL NETWORK; LONELINESS
AB Most studies that report males as more aggressive than females have
   examined only direct aggression. However, recent research has shown
   that females may be more indirectly aggressive than males. Lagerspetz
   et al. [1988: Aggressive Behavior 14:403-414] have suggested that this
   gender difference in indirect aggression may arise because females have
   more dense networks than males, providing them with more opportunities
   for using indirect aggression. The present study examined the
   relationship between network density and aggression by administering
   self-report measures of each variable to 148 undergraduates. Males with
   high-density networks reported more indirect than direct aggression,
   and less direct aggression than males with low-density networks. Use of
   direct and indirect aggression by females was not related to network
   density. Explanations consider possible inhibitory and facilitating
   effects of network density. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB This paper presents an evolutionary perspective on children's resource
   directed behaviour in peer groups. It is argued that reciprocity is
   theoretically expected to be the fundamental rule of resource exchange
   in peer relationships of friendship. Children are therefore expected to
   be attracted to peers who are similar to themselves on a wide variety
   of traits. These traits are viewed as resources in peer relationships,
   and individual differences in these traits represent a resource
   environment for children. In this paper, the resource environment
   represented by individual differences in several evolved motivational
   systems will be emphasised. The discussion focuses on such three
   evolved systems, the sensation seeking/impulsivity system, the human
   affectional system, and the behavioural inhibition system. It is
   concluded that individual differences in these systems are important
   for understanding friendship and sociometric status in children's peer
   relationships.

AB To evaluate the role of individual recognition in the evolution of
   cooperation, we formulated and analyzed a genetic algorithm model
   (EvCo) for playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) game.
   Strategies compete against each other during each generation, and
   successful strategies contribute more of their attributes to the next
   generation. Each strategy is encoded on a 'chromosome' that plays the
   IPD, responding to the sequences of most recent responses by the
   interacting individuals (chromosomes). The analysis reported in this
   paper considered different memory capabilities (one to five previous
   interactions), pairing continuities (pairs of individuals remain
   together for about one, two, five, or 1000 consecutive interactions),
   and types of individual recognition (recognition capability was
   maximal, nil, or allowed to evolve between these limits). Analysis of
   the results focused on the frequency of mutual cooperation in pairwise
   interactions (a good indicator of overall success in the IPD) and on
   the extent to which previous responses by the focal individual and its
   partner were associated with the partner's identity (individual
   recognition). Results indicated that a fixed, substantial amount of
   individual recognition could maintain high levers of mutual cooperation
   even at low pairing continuities, and a significant but limited
   capability for individual recognition evolved under selection.
   Recognition generally increased mutual cooperation more when the recent
   responses of individuals other than the current partner were ignored.
   Titrating recognition memory under selection using a fitness cost
   suggested that memory of the partner's previous responses was more
   valuable than memory of the focal's previous responses. The dynamics
   produced to date by EvCo are a step toward understanding the evolution
   of social networks, for which additional benefits associated with group
   interactions must be incorporated.

AB Stability of social relationships may be an important indicator of
   lifestyle quality. Fifteen individuals with intellectual disabilities
   participated in an analysis of the relationship between their social
   skills (as measured via the Scales of Independent Behavior and the
   Assessment of Social Competence) and the stability of the social
   relationships they experienced with other community members, who were
   neither paid staff nor family members, across the course of 94
   consecutive weeks. A participant's social skills did a moderately good
   job of predicting the average social stability achieved by all of his
   or her social network members, but a poorer job of predicting the
   average social stability achieved by the participant's three most
   stable social network members. The findings suggest that the stability
   of a participant's most stable social network members is based not on
   the participant's social skills, but rather on other factors.

AB Objectives: The study used the social antecedent model of depression in
   later life. proposed by Linda K. George to develop a multifactorial
   model of predictors of depression among aging persons with
   schizophrenia living in the community. Methods: The SHORT-CARE and the
   Network Analysis Profile, along with supplemental items, were
   administered to 117 outpatients age 55 and older who received DSM-III-R
   diagnoses of schizophrenia before age 45. Bivariate and multivariate
   analyses examined associations between 27 variables derived from
   George's model and the presence of depression, A cutoff score for the
   depression scale of the SHORT-CARE was used to detect clinically
   significant depression. Results: Forty-four percent of the sample had
   probable pervasive depression. Bivariate analysis indicated that 16
   variables were significantly associated with depression, and logistic
   regression showed that six variables were strong predictors, Depression
   was associated with the presence of positive symptoms, physical
   limitations interfering with activities, younger age, diminished
   linkage of members of the social network, lower income, and a smaller
   proportion of social network members who provided sustenance such as
   food and money. An Ii-variable model correctly classified 81 percent of
   cases. Conclusions: The level of depression among older outpatients
   with schizophrenia is approximately one and a half to three times the
   level in the general older population. Depression in this patient group
   is associated with nonclinical variables that are independent of
   psychoses and that resemble patterns found among general older
   populations, Several of the variables are potentially alterable and
   therefore afford opportunities to enhance the well-being of persons
   with schizophrenia who live in the community.

AB The present study investigated disclosure of sexual assault to members
   of one's social network in a convenience sample of sexual assault
   victims (N = 155) completing a mail survey. Three sets of correlates
   (demographics, assault characteristics, postassault experiences) of the
   timing of sexual assault disclosure and subsequent social reactions
   received from social network members were examined. Delayed disclosure
   was associated with childhood sexual assault history: completed rape,
   and avoidance coping, whereas early disclosure was associated with
   offender preassault alcohol use and postassault medical attention.
   Negative social reactions were more common among women who used
   avoidance coping and victims who told physicians or police about their
   assaults. Positive social reactions were associated with higher income,
   less physical injury due to the assault, less self-blame, less
   postassault distress, and saying that a friend/relative or a rape
   crisis center was helpful regarding the assault. Implications of these
   results for research and treatment of sexual assault survivors are
   discussed.

AB Recent research on the effects of social networks and social support
   resources on psychiatric disorder reflects two themes. The first
   focuses on the protective features of perceived social support. In this
   context, research shows that social support protects individuals from
   major depressive illness. The second theme emphasizes the idea that
   social networks are also sources of stressors that increase the risk of
   onset and recurrence of psychiatric disorders. Research on expressed
   emotion is prominent in this regard.

ID HIERARCHY FORMATION
AB The method of E-state structuralism provides dynamic models for the
   evolution and development of networks in small groups. Our interest
   lies in the kind of social networks that these models produce. We ask
   the question of whether such models produce ''interesting'' structure
   from a network point-of-view, in particular, from the perspective of
   Holland and Leinhardt who argue that any network that can be modeled
   adequately using only properties of nodes and dyads has no social
   structure. We show that E-state structuralism models are models of
   social structure in this technical sense because they assume a
   bystander mechanism in the creation of ties.

AB TO revisit the rural-urban contrast, we use data from nonmetropolitan
   and metropolitan subsamples of the 1985 General Social Survey to test
   whether, compared to personal networks in urban settings, personal
   networks in rural settings contain ties of greater intensity and role
   multiplexity, are based more on kinship and neighborhood solidarities
   rather than on friendship, are smaller, are denser, and have greater
   educational, race-ethnic, and religious homogeneity, but less age and
   gender homogeneity. Our results are generally consistent with these
   predictions. Mie then present evidence for rural diversity by comparing
   data from residents of a two-parish nonmetropolitan area in
   southwestern Louisiana to the nonmetropolitan subsample of the GSS.
   After discussing possible mechanisms for this covariation of spatial
   and aspatial communities, we conclude by commenting on the potential of
   network analysis to contribute to the resolution of these and other
   substantively important problems in rural sociology.

TI Is politics power or policy oriented? A comparative analysis of dynamic
   access models in policy networks
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE policy networks; collective decision making; computer simulation;
   object-oriented modeling; dynamic modeling of social networks
AB In policy networks actors use access relations to influence preferences
   of other actors. Establishment and shifts of access relations and their
   consequences for outcomes of decisions are the main focal points in
   this paper. Unlike most policy network studies, we therefore do not
   take the network and its relations as given and constant. Instead we
   device computer simulation models to account for the dynamics in policy
   networks. We compare different models and investigate the resulting
   network structures and predicted outcomes of decisions. The choice
   among the alternative models is made by their correspondence with
   empirical network structures and actual outcomes of decisions.
   In our models, we assume that all relevant actors aim at policy
   outcomes as close as possible to their own preferences. Policy outcomes
   are determined by the preferences df the final decision makers at the
   moment of the vote. In general, only a small fraction of the actors
   takes part in the final vote. Most actors have therefore to rely on
   access relations for directly or indirectly shaping the preferences of
   the final decision makers. For this purpose actors make access requests
   to other actors. An access relation is assumed to be established if
   such a request is accepted by the other actor.
   Access relations require time and resources. Actors are therefore
   assumed to be restricted in the number of access requests they can make
   and the number of requests they can accept Moreover, due to incomplete
   information and simultaneous actions by other actors, actors have to
   make simplifying assumptions in the selection of their ''best''
   requests and learn by experience.
   We device two base models that correspond to two basic views on the
   nature of political processes. In the first view politics is seen as
   power driven. Corresponding to this view, actors aim at access
   relations with the most powerful actors in the field. They estimate
   their likelihood of success by comparing their own resources with those
   of the target actors. Power also determines the order in which actors
   accept requests. In the second view, policy matters and actors roughly
   estimate the effects access relations might have on the outcome of
   decisions. Actors select requests to ''bolster'' their own preference
   as much as possible.
   We will show that these base models and some intermediate ones result
   in fundamentally different network structures and predicted outcomes.
   Moreover, we will show that the policy driven models do fundamentally
   better than the power driven models.

TI Status and participation in task groups: A dynamic network model
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID EXCHANGE NETWORKS; POWER
AB This article presents a dynamic model for the formation of status
   orders in small task groups whose members may be differentiated by a
   diffuse status characteristic. This theoretical strategy embodies
   ''E-state structuralism,'' which unites the social psychological
   formalism of expectation states theory with social network research.
   Using the development of status hierarchies via differential
   participation in group discussion, the formal model synthesizes (a) the
   conceptual structure of Fisek, Berger, and Norman, (b) Balkwell's
   formula for status effects on probabilities of directed participation,
   and (c) Fararo and Skvoretz's E-state structuralism model for the
   formation of dominance structures. After describing this synthesis, the
   article presents the model in axiomatic form and provides a simulation
   of its dynamic consequences.

AB This study is the first phase of a project to develop a
   culturally-appropriate, family-mediated social support intervention
   program. This phase consisted of in-home interviews with 26
   African-American (AF) and 26 Filipino-American (FA) parents who were
   not receiving counseling or social services for parent-child conflict,
   and self-reported adequate personal and family functioning. In general,
   parents were college educated and employed full-time and had household
   incomes of over $25,000. On average, AF parents were 35 years old, with
   4 people in the household, including 2 children (mean age = 10 years).
   FA parents were older, averaging 45 years, and had 6 people in the
   household, including 3 children (mean age = 12 years). Mean scores on
   standardized measures reflected high self-esteem and positive attitudes
   toward their children and families. Social network size averaged 32 and
   38 members for AF and FA mothers respectively, and 24 and 29 members
   for AF and FA fathers. Most parents reported that fewer than 50% of
   their network members knew each other. Data also suggested that parents
   reported a generally positive orientation to utilizing support
   resources, and favorable perceptions of and satisfaction with support
   form family and friends. Analyzes revealed that only functional support
   variables were significantly associated with parent well-being. Study
   limitations, service implications, and further research directions are
   discussed.

AB Following Homans, exchange theorists have modeled informal social
   control as an exchange of peer approval for compliance with group
   obligations. The exchange model predicts higher compliance in cohesive
   networks with strong social ties. However, previous specifications
   failed to incorporate bilateral exchange of approval. Computer
   simulations using a Bush-Mosteller stochastic learning model show that
   bilateral exchanges evolve more readily than multilateral, causing
   social control to flow into the maintenance of interpersonal
   relationships at the expense of compliance with group obligations, a
   structural form of the ''second-order free-rider problem.''

AB The focus of the debate over hospital versus community care for those
   with severe and enduring mental health problems has shifted somewhat
   towards ensuring the quality of care provided by services regardless of
   their location. One factor that is generally assumed to be an important
   indicator of quality of care is the opportunity for community contact
   that users of a residential service have. This is illustrated by its
   inclusion in most instruments designed to assess quality of care in
   psychiatric services. The present study set out to examine the amount
   of community contact made by residents of three units of a London
   psychiatric rehabilitation service. Level of community contact was
   indeed found to be unrelated to the location of these facilities on a
   hospital site or in the community. However, interesting differences did
   emerge across units in the type of community contact made by residents
   and in the identity of residents' companions on community trips.

AB There is a persistent need to find usable ways of measuring social
   network and support for children. Up to now virtually nothing is known
   about the social network from the child's viewpoint. In order to
   evaluate whether drawing a structured social network map (the Five
   Field Map) could serve as a way of elucidating important aspects of the
   social world of children, the maps of different samples of children
   were studied. In a school class of 27 children, aged 11 years, a
   test-retest study was undertaken. The essential aspects of the map
   showed good stability over time. The map was compared with other
   instruments of social interaction in different samples. Predicted
   associations were found in the nonclinical samples. Aspects of the map
   measuring dissatisfaction, negative contacts, and conflicts were found
   to be associated with behaviour problems. The closeness factor of the
   map and reported dissatisfaction and conflicts differentiated a normal
   group of children living in single-parent families from a similar group
   of children with psychiatric problems, The Five Field Map contributes
   important knowledge about how children perceive their social world. It
   can thus be considered a suitable instrument to describe the social
   network from the child's point of view.

SO SYMBOLIC INTERACTION

AB Most research on role transitions, following a tradition pioneered by
   van Gennep, regards these major turning points in the life course
   primarily as times when people move between different sets of social
   networks. While these studies acknowledge that rites of passage occur
   within particular physical spaces in which material objects are
   present, the importance of such objects has received little attention.
   I explore one particular role transition-moving away to college-and
   illustrate that objects play a central role in how students construct
   their identities. Students at ''Midwestern'' University make strategic
   choices about which objects to leave at home as anchors of prior
   identities and which ones to bring to school as markers of new
   identities. Moreover, I suggest that the meanings of these two
   categories of objects differ by gender. I argue that this case opens vp
   the possibility that objects play a much more central part in role
   transitions than social scientists have acknowledged. This study also
   challenges existing assumptions about different processes of identity
   formation. Therefore, it engenders the need for additional research
   about how people reinterpret objects during role transitions, and about
   the different meanings that objects may have for the constructions of
   masculinity and femininity.

AB In this study a path analytic approach was used to investigate
   predictors of the sense of competence in primary caregivers of demented
   persons. Data were gathered from 141 pairs of demented persons living
   in the community and their informal primary caregivers. Analysis of the
   information reported by the primary caregivers indicated that sense of
   competence and its component domains were affected above all by
   behavioural problems of the demented person and degree of neuroticism
   of the primary caregiver. No significant influence was found on the
   sense of competence of formal support of home helps and district
   nurses. The results suggested that the amount of support the demented
   person received from other social network members only had a limited
   influence on the domains of sense of competence. Copyright (C) 1996

AB People use weak ties-relationships with acquaintances or strangers-to
   seek help unavailable from friends or colleagues. Yet in the absence of
   personal relationships or the expectation of direct reciprocity, help
   from weak ties might not be forthcoming or could be of low quality. We
   examined the practice of distant employees (strangers) exchanging
   technical advice through a large organizational computer network. A
   survey of advice seekers and those who replied was conducted to test
   hypotheses about the viability and usefulness of such electronic weak
   tie exchanges.
   Theories of organizational motivation suggest that positive regard for
   the larger organization can substitute for direct incentives or
   personal relationships in motivating people to help others. Theories of
   weak ties suggest that the usefulness of this help may depend on the
   number of ties, the diversity of ties, or the resources of help
   providers. We hypothesized that, in an organizational context, the
   firm-specific resources and organizational motivation of people who
   provide advice will predict the usefulness of advice.
   We investigated these theories in a study of employees of a global
   computer manufacturer. We collected survey and observational data on
   the relationships between information seekers and information
   providers; the number, diversity, resources, and motivations of
   information providers, and subjective ratings of the usefulness of the
   advice (from both parties in the exchange) and whether or not the
   advice solved information seekers' problems.
   We found that information providers gave useful advice and solved the
   problems of information seekers, despite their lack of a personal
   connection with the seekers. The data support the main hypotheses and
   provide some support for resource and diversity explanations of weak
   tie influence. We discuss how this organization's culture sustained
   useful information exchange through weak ties.

AB Since the Conservatives came to government in 1979 the policy climate
   generally in the U.K. has been one of the privatization of public
   provision and tighter controls on public spending. A re-positioning of
   health and social care has taken place in the light of this
   pre-eminence of market forces with the assumption increasingly being
   made that potential service users operate on a 'level playing field' of
   opportunity. A major consequence has been the expansion of household
   health responsibilities through measures which include a greater
   emphasis on preventative screening and healthy lifestyles and a general
   shift in the locus of care to the 'community'. Not only has the last
   decade seen this intensification of pressure on women in their social
   role as family carers, a restructuring has taken place of the U.K.
   labour market such that the 'double burden' of paid and unpaid work is
   an increasingly common experience. Contrary to the policy view of
   equality of access, in-depth interview evidence from Liverpool shows
   that the health care behaviour of many women is increasingly
   constrained by their social roles and availability of economic and
   social network resources. This paper distinguishes between groups who
   are and are not well equipped to cope in the light of changing
   structures of provision and discusses the implications of the research
   for the design and implementation of health and social care.

ID UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; WOMEN
AB U.S. welfare reform initiatives are based on the assumption that the
   primary barriers to economic independence are individual deficits.
   However, the policy does not adequately account for situational and
   personal factors necessary for a successful transition from welfare to
   work. Without greater attention to these barriers, the policy is likely
   to fail or be implemented at high personal cost to recipients and their
   families. This paper uses a person-in-environment social systems
   framework to examine the personal and family resources available to a
   group of women who were receiving AFDC and participating in an urban
   Head Start program. Structured interviews and literacy assessments with
   77 AFDC recipients participating in a Head Start program indicate that
   the barriers to self-support are not related to substance abuse, health
   problems, deficits in literacy, or a lack of interest in work. However,
   most caregivers do not have adequate training or education to prepare
   them to compete ill the job market, nor do they feel equipped to find a
   job on their own. The results with respect to family resources are
   mixed. While families possess a number of coping mechanisms, caregivers
   have little support from social network members for day-to-day child
   care activities. The implications of the findings for welfare policy
   are discussed.

SO SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
AB Many of the concepts of social network analysis have been tacit
   assumptions of sexually transmitted disease control efforts for
   decades, With the advent of AIDS in the 1980s, an overt rapprochement
   between these two fields - previously separated by culture, context,
   and language - was made, Social network constructs have immediate
   appeal to disease control workers, who devi many diseases as following
   the conduits of social interactions, STDs and HIV, in turn, provide
   network analysts and those who model disease transmission with
   substantial sets of empirical data that test and illuminate theory.
   Disease control efforts can he enchanced by incorporating network
   concepts overtly into current practices, Such concepts offer a path to
   better delineation of groups at risk, to a better understanding of the
   interaction of personal risk taking and the social contest, and to
   evaluation of control mechanisms.

AB Objective: To describe self-reported types of sexual identity of men
   who have sex with men (MSM) in the Dominican Republic, assess
   sociodemographics and behavioral characteristics, and measure the
   prevalence of HIV-1 and syphilis.
   Design: Cross-sectional study of MSM recruited from a variety of
   community settings.
   Methods: A total of 354 men agreed to participate after giving verbal
   informed consent. Information was obtained using a standardized
   questionnaire assessing demographics and AIDS-relevant information.
   Blood was obtained for HIV and syphilis testing.
   Results: Five main sexual identity groups emerged: cross dressers,
   homosexuals, gigolos, bisexuals and heterosexuals. Receptive anal and
   oral intercourse were commonly reported by men self-identifying as
   cross dressers or homosexuals, whereas nearly all of the remaining
   three groups practiced only insertive intercourse. Sexual contact with
   women was also commonly reported; overall, consistent condom use was
   infrequent. HIV antibodies were detected in 11.0% and serologic
   evidence of syphilis was found in 7.3%. Factors independently
   associated with HIV infection included serologic evidence of syphilis,
   having visited at least one of four local brothels in 1975-1985, and
   having had receptive anal intercourse with four or more partners in the
   last 12 months.
   Conclusions: Syphilis, sexual practices and social context of sex
   (commercial sex), rather than sexual identity per se, were associated
   with HIV infection. The complex social networks of MSM in this setting,
   the tendency to practice either insertive or receptive sex, but not
   both, infrequent condom use, high rates of syphilis and the frequency
   of sex with women need to be taken into account for targeted HIV
   prevention programs to be successful.

AB In a cross-sectional study of 174 new injecting drug users (IDUs) in
   New York City who had injected for less than or equal to 6 years, we
   examined whether those who both share syringes and have personal risk
   networks that include high-risk injectors are particularly likely to be
   infected with HIV. Subjects were street recruited between July 1991 and
   January 1993, were interviewed about their risk behaviors in the prior
   2 years and their personal risk networks with other IDUs in the prior
   30 days, and were tested for HIV; 20% were HIV seropositive. Among
   those who both shared syringes and had a personal risk network member
   who injected more than once a day, 40% were HIV seropositive (versus
   14% for others, p < 0.001). In simultaneous multiple logistic
   regression, the interaction of both sharing syringes and having a
   personal risk network member who injected more than once a day remained
   independently and significantly associated with being HIV seropositive
   (OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.22, 10.43; p < 0.020), along with Latino
   race/ethnicity and exchanging sex for money or drugs. These findings
   suggest that the combination of sharing syringes with having a
   high-risk personal network is a risk factor for HIV infection among new
   IDUs. Studies of risk factors for HIV infection among new IDUs and
   interventions to reduce the spread of HIV among them should focus on
   their risk networks as well as their risk behaviors.

TI A comparison of the Johnson Intervention with four other methods of
   referral to outpatient treatment
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE
LA English
DT Article
ID ALCOHOLICS; FAMILY; SEEKING
AB The Johnson Intervention is a therapeutic technique in which members of
   the person's social network confront him or her about the damage the
   drinking or drug use has caused and the action they will take if
   treatment is refused. It is highly effective in engaging and retaining
   clients in inpatient treatment, but, since initial evaluations, two
   trends have emerged in the field. First. there has been an increase in
   the use of outpatient treatment and, second, a number of variations of
   the Johnson Intervention have been developed. The purpose of this study
   was to compare the effectiveness of the Johnson Intervention with four
   other methods of referral to outpatient treatment. The other methods
   included two naturally occurring types of referral (coerced and
   noncoerced) and two less intense and less costly variations of the
   Intervention (Unrehearsed and Unsupervised). Effectiveness was
   determined by both entry into and completion of treatment. A
   retrospective study was conducted on a sample of 331 cases drawn from
   an alcohol and other drug treatment agency. Those who had undergone the
   Johnson Intervention were more likely to enter treatment than those in
   any of the four other groups. Of those that entered treatment, the
   Johnson Intervention and the coerced referral groups were equally
   likely to complete treatment, and both groups were more likely to
   complete treatment than those in the other three types of referral.
   Although the Johnson Intervention was the most effective, the
   variations did show some measure of success and can be viewed as part
   of an Intervention continuum.

AB This paper advances a theoretical method that uses social exchange
   theory to explain the structure of social networks. I begin to develop
   this generic method through a specific application. Reformulating
   Blau's (1964) model of social exchange to reflect the dynamic nature of
   interaction and the accompanying potential for opportunistic behavior,
   I demonstrate how social exchange may be formalized as a repeated game,
   and how game-theoretic models may be used to predict the stability of
   particular exchange network structures. The specific application offers
   some evidence of the fruitfulness of the generic theoretical method,
   providing an explanation for the strong, reciprocal relationships in
   the workgroup advice network observed by Blau (1955).

AB Sharing of contaminated needles constitutes one of the primary modes of
   HIV transmission in the U.S. This study examined social and
   environmental factors as possible correlates of needle sharing in a
   sample of inner-city drug users in Baltimore, Maryland. Drug users'
   social context was assessed through an analysis of personal networks,
   and the environmental context of drug use was assessed through a
   delineation of injection settings. The 330 respondents participating in
   an HIV prevention study were administered two surveys an average of 5.2
   months apart. An examination of the association of network
   characteristics at baseline and needle sharing at followup revealed
   that the factors of higher total network density, larger drug network
   size, and injecting at friends' residences were positively associated
   with reports of sharing needles that had been cleaned with bleach.
   Sharing of needles that had not been disinfected with bleach was
   positively associated with reports of injecting in semipublic areas
   (streets, rooftops, parks, cars, public bathrooms, and abandoned
   buildings). These data support ecological and resource models of needle
   sharing and suggest the potential utility of network-oriented
   strategies for reducing needle sharing among injecting drug users.

AB Health program evaluation is generally focused on an examination of
   individual program characteristics and accomplishments, vet many
   programs are part of a broader service system. Evaluation of the role a
   program plays in that system is an important evaluation question to
   address. A network analysis of program referral patterns was used to
   evaluate Connecticut's Healthy Start program. Network analysis showed
   that Healthy Start played a ''broker'' role in 4 case study
   communities, sending and receiving referrals of pregnant women to a
   higher than average number of other programs. Further, in the urban
   area case study, competing market players providing services to
   pregnant women resulted in subsets of services with dense referral
   patterns within the subsets but little referral between subsets.
   Healthy Start was found to be instrumental as an integrator of these
   otherwise disconnected service subsets.

AB Social context may be an important determinant of drug and alcohol
   consumption and HIV-related behaviors. To assess the influence of peers
   on drug users' risk behaviors this study examined the association
   between individual level and group level behaviors. This analysis
   reports on the prospective association between baseline self-reported
   drug and alcohol use of the network members of injection drug users,
   and self-reported sexual behaviors and alcohol use at 5-month
   follow-up. Participants were a nontreatment sample of inner-city
   injection drug users who volunteered for a network-oriented HIV
   preventive intervention. They were predominately unemployed, African
   American males. Of the 71 index participants who completed both the
   baseline and follow-up interviews, 227 of their drug network members
   were enrolled in the study. At baseline indexes' sexual risk behaviors
   were significantly associated with their drug network members' level of
   crack cocaine use. At follow-up higher levels of alcohol and crack use
   among drug network members were associated with indexes' reports of
   multiple sex partners and increased alcohol consumption. Higher levels
   of crack use among the drug network members were associated with the
   indexes' reporting casual sex partners at follow-up. These results
   highlight the importance of studying the role of peer group influence
   and the social context of risk behaviors.

AB This study explores the relationship between stress in the parent-child

   whose children had attained at least preschool age. Using probit
   regression techniques, a significant negative relationship was found to
   exist between parent-child stress and successful component completion
   for there participants. Further assessment probed the contribution of
   study participants' personal and social strengths and problem-child
   behaviors as contributors to stress: Lower levels of mastery and higher
   perceived levels of child problem behaviors were found to be associated
   with the level of stress in the parent-child relationship. Findings,

TI One and two year outcomes for adults with learning disabilities
   discharged to the community
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background. Long-stay patients with learning disabilities (n=214) were
   assessed in hospital and 12 and 24 months after discharge in order to
   examine the effects of relocation.
   Method. Each resident acted as his/her own control in a prospective
   repeated-measures design. Skills and behavioural problems were assessed
   by keyworkers. Self-perceived quality of life was obtained during
   interviews with researchers who also completed an environmental
   checklist of the residents' accommodation.
   Results. There was little or no change in people's low pre-discharge
   skill levels. Certain aspects of problem behaviour improved after 12
   months, although socially unacceptable behaviour increased slightly.
   People were less depressed (P less than or equal to 0.01) 12 months
   after discharge (n=119) and were more satisfied (P less than or equal
   to 0.05) with their new 'homes' (n=108). There were few changes in the
   pattern of a activities or the social networks of people 12 months
   later. Little or no further change in outcomes was reported 24 months
   after discharge.
   Conclusions. The implementation of the deinstitutionalisation policy in
   Northern Ireland has been limited by the predominance of residential
   and nursing homes and the lack of 'ordinary' accommodation. There is a
   need for purchasers and providers to give more attention to ways in
   which the principles of normalisation could be incorporated in the
   process of contracting and delivering services.

AB The program described here tests the effectiveness of a community-based
   and school-based program to reduce violence among African-American and
   Hispanic adolescents. The program methods are based on social network
   theory research, which has found that key lay people in communities can
   be identified and trained to carry out prevention programs. The
   educational content is based on theories suggesting that
   characteristics of healthy, adaptive individuals and communities can be
   taught, A violence-prevention leadership program is provided to a
   cohort of middle-school student peer leaders and their parents and for
   the leaders of the neighborhoods around cite middle schools, Three
   matched pairs of urban middle-school attendance zones were randomly
   assigned to receive either the intervention or serve as a
   nonintervention control group. Surveys, interviews, and observations
   were conducted with the peer leaders, their parents, community leaders,
   and community residents. Sixty-six percent of the peer leaders reported
   that they had hit someone in the past 30 days. Twenty-six percent of
   the sixth-graders had punched or beaten someone in the past 30 days.
   Within the past year, 6% of the adults had slapped or kicked someone.
   Within the past 30 days, 14% of the sixth-graders had been punched or
   beaten. Within the Fast year, 6% of the adults had been punched or
   beaten. A large percentage of adolescents are victims and perpetrators
   of violence and are exposed to violence in their neighborhoods,
   Violence-prevention strategies can be implemented through
   collaborations among health departments, community-based organizations,
   universities, and schools. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): violence,
   primary prevention, program evaluation, longitudinal studies,

AB A cognitive-behavioral model for treating couples' negative reactions
   to infertility is described. After a discussion of why the
   cognitive-behavioral approach can competently address the goals of
   couples coping with infertility, three phases of treatment are
   outlined: assessment, therapy, and closure. Areas for assessment
   include the individual spouse, the marital relationship, and the
   familial and social network. Therapeutic components entail
   identification and validity testing of appraisals and attributions
   regarding infertility and marriage, redirection of the couple's
   energies toward alternative sources of satisfaction, communication and
   problem-solving techniques to facilitate expression of emotions and
   needs and resolution of the infertility crisis, and improving the
   couple's sexual relationship.

AB We monitored trends in HIV risk behaviors and seroconversion among
   out-of-treatment injection drug users (IDUs) receiving street-based
   outreach intervention. Beginning in 1988, 641 HIV-seronegative IDUs
   were recruited by targeted sampling methods to reflect broader IDU
   populations and were followed for 4 years (1988-1992). All were active
   injectors not in treatment when recruited. Cohort members were targets
   of HIV-prevention outreach. The intervention was guided by the
   Indigenous Leader Outreach Model: Exaddicts deliver HIV-prevention
   services targeting IDU social networks in community settings. Primary
   outcome measures were HIV seroconversion and HIV risk behaviors.
   Observed incidence of HIV infection decreased, from 8.4 to 2.4 per 100
   person-years. Prevalence of drug risk behaviors also decreased, from
   100 to 14%. Seroconversion was associated with injection risk behavior
   [risk ratio (RR) = 9.8]. Sex risk behavior also decreased, but less
   dramatically, from 71 to 45%. Out-of-treatment IDUs in Chicago have
   reduced their rates of new HIV infection by reducing their injection
   risk behavior. New infections were strongly associated with injection
   risk behavior but not with sex risk behavior.

AB In a series of articles from the Stockholm Spinal Cord Injury Study
   (SSCIS), the health status of a near-total regional SCI population
   comprising 353 subjects has been investigated. The present study
   describes the psyche-social and financial consequences of SCI in this
   group. It is based on a level-of-living survey that has been used
   annually on 8000-14 000 Swedes since 1974. The health-focused version
   of this survey was used for data collection in the subset of 326
   subjects in the SSCIS that were residents of the Greater Stockholm
   area. The normative material consisted of 1978 interviews of residents
   of the same area, provided by the Swedish Bureau of Statistics. The
   results show that SCI subjects, although provided with basic material
   commodities up to par with the general population, have less financial
   reserves and more frequently express worry about their finances. Less
   than half of the subjects are gainfully employed, when part-time jobs
   are also included. Social activities are more restricted, and more
   centered on the core social network. Several items in the survey point
   to a preoccupation with personal rather than public matters.
   We feel that these factors, at least to some degree, are consequential
   to separation from the workplace, with resulting disadvantageous
   financial and social effects. Intensified vocational rehabilitation
   efforts might thus be justified from both an economic and a
   psyche-social point of view.

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB How will the role of the information systems (IS) professional develop
   during the first half of the 21st Century? What will be the kinds of
   skills required for them to make a useful contribution in the provision
   of information systems? This paper reflects on these issues, drawing on
   the IS and innovation diffusion literatures. Following a review of
   electronic vis a vis social networks, the paper foresees the latter as
   crucial in the construction and diffusion of new knowledge in an IS
   community.
   A main contribution of the paper is that it utilizes a variety of
   disciplinary perspectives in order better to understand and improve use
   of information in organizations. This approach is in line with the view
   that in the future transdisciplinary forms of knowledge production will
   make traditional, disciplinary-based knowledge domains largely obsolete
   (Gibbons, 1995) and that knowledge relevant to IS professionals will be
   no different in this respect.
   Given this, the future role of the IS professional is portrayed here as
   that of a key change agent in the development, diffusion, and
   implementation of new ideas. A primary activity is foreseen as being
   one of bringing together and synthesising information, ideas, and
   practices from a range of disciplines with the focus being on
   information leading to the development of knowledge leading to the
   development of knowledge and expertise within organizations, not
   systems per se. The paper concludes by identifying implications of this
   analysis for IS curriculum development.

AB The aim of the present study is to acquire insight into the changes of
   quality of life, social networks, and social support of cancer patients
   during the first year after diagnosis, as well as into the relation
   between social support and the changes in quality of life. Newly
   diagnosed cancer patients (n = 51) were followed for 1 year.
   Semistructured personal interviews and questionnaires were used to
   gather data. On the average, patients' functioning improved and the
   amount of physical complaints decreased over the year. Psychological
   complaints decreased over the year. Psychological complaints and the
   global evaluation of life, however, did not change significantly over
   time. The patients were supported by small, dense networks, consisting
   mostly of family members. Size of the networks as well as the amount of
   emotional support showed some decrease over time. It appeared that
   emotional support was positively related to quality of life. Moreover,
   a tendency was found to indicate that patients with a deterioration in
   quality of life perceived a larger decrease in emotional support than
   patients with a positive course. The amount of perceived instrumental
   support did not change significantly. There is a tendency that patients
   who were functioning worse had a greater need for instrumental support.
   Although these findings indicate relations between types of support and
   quality of life, we cannot make statements on the causality of these
   relations.

TI Screening African-American elderly for the presence of depressive

DT Article
ID BLACK; POPULATION
AB Several authors have reported that older African-Americans with
   multiple medical problems and decreased activities of daily living are
   at an increased risk of reporting symptoms of depression.
   African-Americans were more likely to report symptoms of anger,
   irritability, denial of illness, and to spontaneously report symptoms
   that did not reflect a change in mood, but rather forbearance of a
   difficult time or somatic complaints. This paper describes the results
   of a study to assess the presence of depressive symptoms in older
   African-American community residents. Anew instrument, the Baker Belief
   Scale, is compared with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression
   Scale (CES-D) and the association of medical illnesses, social network,
   and level of physical function in activities of daily Living (ADL).
   Ninety-six African-American men and women, aged 60 years or older, with
   equal representation from urban and rural counties in western Tennessee
   comprised the sample. The sample was stratified, in each of the two
   counties, into three age categories; 60-69, 70-79, and 80 years and
   older. A screening battery consisting of the Short Portable Mental
   Status Questionnaire, the CES-D, the Lubben Social Network Scale, and
   the Katz ADL were administered to the sample. Current medical illnesses
   were recorded with demographic data. There was a significant
   association between the CES-D score and the BBS score for those who
   screened positive for symptoms of depression. In addition there was a
   significant relationship between CES-D score and specific medical
   illnesses, social network, physical function in ADL, and residence
   (urban vs. rural). Residents who screened positive (N = 19) for
   depressive symptomatology with CES-D scores of 16 or higher exhibited a
   higher frequency of hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and circulatory
   problems than those who tested negative (N = 77). More urban residents
   (N = 13) than rural residents (N = 6) screened positive for symptoms of
   depression. Approximately 21% (N = 20) of the 96 respondents had scores
   of 20 or less on the Lubben Social Network Scale, suggesting a group
   ''at risk'' for social isolation.

TI Algebraic structure of the interaction semigroup as related to the
   homogeneity of network
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper addresses the development of a semigroup model of social
   networks. Data matrices which represent the perceived relationships
   between members of a social network are used to construct a (possibly
   infinite) data semigroup of derived relations defined by (real) matrix
   multiplication. This complex structure is analyzed by forming
   interaction semigroups. These semigroups are homomorphic images of the
   data semigroup. The corresponding congruences are generated by
   identifying products of finite order which are highly positively
   correlated. Several methods of generating the interaction semigroups
   are examined and are shown to generate nonhomomorphic semigroups. For
   each congruence, an associated triple of numbers can be defined which
   may serve as an indicator of the validity and/or a measure of the
   stability of the semigroup model. A series of hypothetical examples is
   developed to study how the algebraic properties of interaction
   semigroups reflect and uncover properties of associated networks.
   Specifically, relationships between homogeneity of a network and the
   algebraic structure of the corresponding interaction semigroup are
   addressed. The applicability of the above techniques to blockmodels is
   demonstrated.

AB We hypothesized that, within a primate group, socialization processes
   are influenced by each group member behaving according to his own
   social network. Therefore socialization processes would differ in
   various social environments. In this study, we considered two main
   socialization processes, the acquisition of a social behavioral
   repertoire and the development of a network of social relationships,
   and consequently defined six comprehensive developmental parameters. We
   analyzed the variability of these parameters using a new multifactorial
   method, the Principal Components Analysis with Instrumental Variable,
   PCAIV, derived from the Principal Components Analysis and Multivariate
   Analyses of Variance. This technique allowed us to jointly represent
   the influence of the independent variables and the complex
   relationships between the six dependent variables. The study of the
   social ontogeny of eight infant mangabeys (Cercocebus albigena), reared
   in three different social environments, served as an illustration of
   the use of the new multivariate analysis. A 3-variable-model (age,
   social environment and sex) significantly explained the variability of
   the developmental parameters. The results confirmed the importance of
   social interactions in non-human primate infants' development. The
   application of multivariate methods to the study of individual social
   development looks promising for future research.

AB This paper describes and analyzes the structural and operational
   features of Chinese alien smuggling. Interviews with aliens, smugglers
   and law enforcement officials in China, Hong Kong and the U.S. reveal
   this activity to be a complex process comprising a number of distinct
   operational stages. Our data suggest Chinese alien smuggling groups
   vary in their level of organization but most are best understood as
   task forces, or small groups of people assembled to perform a
   particular piece of work. These task forces are typically linked to
   international social networks characterized by overlapping, dyadic
   relationships; a high level of role differentiation; and a limited
   degree of hierarchy. Such groups are highly responsive to changing
   socio-legal and market constraints.

AB Friendship formation and dissolution were tracked over time in a summer
   camp to examine whether such events are valid indicators of individual
   differences in children's friendship adjustment. Subjects were 216
   children ages 8-15 years. Sociometric nominations were used to
   determine the identities of reciprocal friends. Loneliness at camp was
   also tracked over time. In addition, data on group acceptance,
   behavioral reputations, social competence, and behavioral problems were
   gathered from peers and counselors. Analyses suggested that friendship
   formation and duration were coherent, independent dimensions of
   individual differences and distinct from the overall extensivity of
   involvement in friendships. Regression analyses indicated that the
   temporal parameters of participation in friendship enhanced the
   prediction of changes in loneliness at camp. Age and sex differences in
   temporal parameters were explored, and 4 discrete trajectories for
   friendship involvement were identified. Children with different
   trajectories differed in their behavioral profiles from one another and
   from children who were chronically friendless.

AB Each sexually transmitted disease (STD) epidemic evolves through
   predictable phases, shaped by a dynamic interplay among the pathogen,
   the behaviors of the subpopulations in which it emerges, and the
   prevention efforts that are developed to limit its impact. As STD
   epidemics move through these phases, the sexual and social networks
   that fuel them become located in subpopulations characterized by
   progressively higher rates of sex partner change and less contact with
   the health care system. As a result, phase-appropriate prevention
   strategies and research issues are essential to reducing STDs and their
   consequences.

ID TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST
AB Ethnographers have recently debated two distinct models of
   hunter-gatherer and agriculturalist interaction in the tropical forests
   of island Southeast Asia: (1) the 'Isolate' Model, proposing that
   hunter-gatherers had a social network and stable, tropical forest-based
   foraging economy largely independent of contact with sedentary farmers
   until the historic era, and (2) the 'Interdependent' Model, suggesting
   a lengthy history of symbiotic exchange and economic overlap between
   the two populations. While these models have been examined and debated
   from the perspective of ethnohistoric and linguistic data, relevant
   archaeological evidence has been lacking. This paper uses
   archaeological data on settlement patterns, lithic assemblage
   composition and the regional circulation of ceramics, metal, and other
   trade goods to demonstrate that the types of economic interactions
   suggested by the 'Interdependent' Model have existed between lowland
   agriculturalists and upland foragers in the Tanjay Region of the
   Central Philippines for at least the last 1500 years.

ID INTRAVENOUS-DRUG-USERS; AIDS
AB Combining current psychosocial theories with social network outreach
   and prevention paradigms is an effective mechanism for reducing both
   drug-related and sexual risks for HIV transmission in active drug users
   in midsized towns in the United States. Five hundred and seventy-nine
   individuals were recruited in two towns, one of 50,000 and one of
   10,000 population. Three approaches to intervention were tested, These
   approaches included: (1) an intensive outreach program using indigenous
   outreach workers providing reinforcement of an HIV risk reduction
   program, and (2) a low intensity outreach program combined with a more
   intensive office-based HIV risk reduction program, Both conditions were
   compared with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) recommended
   standard intervention, Each of the enhanced interventions produced a
   reduction in HIV-related risk taking reported by the participants. The
   intensive outreach combined with office intervention and the intensive
   office intervention without outreach reinforcement each produced
   significant reductions in sexual risk taking in active drug users,
   beyond the reductions reported for the NIDA standard program, The
   enhanced risk reduction programs produced differential impacts for
   males and females, respectively, between the two high and low intensity
   outreach models.

SO INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID MIGRATION; BEHAVIOR; PLANS
AB This article explores gender differences in the intentions to move
   among a sample of young adults in rural northeastern Thailand. Based on
   the value-expectancy framework of migration decisionmaking, an
   explanatory model is tested which includes migration-related value
   measures along with individual, household and community-level
   determinants of both intentions to move and change in intentions to
   move. Multinomial logistic regression results based on data from the
   1992 Thailand National Migration Survey provide some support for the
   hypothesis of gender-specific determinants of both intentions to move
   and the reconsideration of migration intentions. For men, value
   measures of affiliation and comfort, social networks, the presence of
   young children in the family, and land holdings are significant
   determinants of migration decisionmaking; for women income and comfort
   values, the presence of elderly persons in the household, community
   size, and crop losses are the salient factors. The results are
   discussed in light of traditional and current cultural expectations for
   men and women in rural Thailand.

AB The poor psychological health of caregivers of the frail aged is
   examined using the stress paradigm and the crises of decline model of
   caregiving burden. Whereas stress paradigms generally focus on
   environmental stressors and individual resources, the crises of decline
   model conceptualizes stress within the social dynamics of the
   caregiving dyad. Data from a cross-sectional study of 144 caregivers
   supported both models. Burden was more likely when the primary
   caregiver experienced degeneration, conflict, enmeshment,
   unpreparedness, and unwillingness. Minor psychiatric symptoms were
   explained in part by burden but also by more traditional stressors
   (supervisory workload) and resources (physical health, self-esteem,
   mastery, coping strategies, social network availability).
   Individualistic interventions to relieve burden and symptoms are
   justifiable on the basis of this study, but with limits to their likely
   success-limits imposed by family institutions of care in which primary
   carers lack experience and feel discomfort with degenerative conditions.

AB Recent social support theory predicts that people derive initial social
   support judgments about others from global qualities, such as
   attitudes, values, and personality. This article presents three studies
   that test this hypothesis. In Study 1, participants described the
   personal qualities and supportiveness of an individual from their
   social networks. Study 2 experimentally manipulated the personal
   characteristics of targets by using a hypothetical other paradigm. In
   Study 3, strangers participated in brief interactions, and then rated
   each other on supportiveness and other personal characteristics. In
   each study, persons were seen as supportive insofar as they were
   perceived as similar to subjects, and as being conscientious. As
   predicted, these judgments could be made with very little information
   about targets, and with no information about the provision of
   supportive behaviors. Further, the same information used to make
   initial support judgments was used in thinking about well-established
   relationships as well.

AB This paper explores the variety of factors which influence Iraq
   farmers' land-use strategies in northern Tanzania. Based on archival
   research, oral history, and detailed field research, this study
   illustrates the ways in which access to and availability of resources
   through social networks and markets over time ave critical to farmers'
   decisions about how to use their labor and land This detailed local
   study of agrarian change examines how wider regional processes of
   change affect focal conditions. It demonstrates that population growth
   neither results automatically in intensification nor in degradation of
   the resource base. The paper also attempts to explore how ideas about
   farming and ''progress'' shape farmers' decisions about land use.

TI Older adults - An 11-year longitudinal study of adult protective
   service use
SO ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Little is known about the epidemiology of adult protective
   services agency (APS) utilization, the state entities charged with
   assessment and advocacy for disenfranchised older adults.
   Objective: To determine the prevalence of utilization by older adults
   and risk factors for APS.
   Methods: A longitudinal study using the New Haven Established
   Population for Epidemiologic Studies in the Elderly population, a
   cohort of 2812 community-dwelling adults who were older than 65 years
   in 1982. The main outcome measure was referral to the state ombudsman
   on aging for protective services.
   Results: Over the 11-year follow-up period, 209 cohort members (7.4%)
   were referred to the ombudsman 302 times as protective service cases
   for a community prevalence of 6.4% after adjusting for the sampling
   strategy of the cohort. Self-neglect was the most common indication for
   referral (73% of the cases). While in bivariate analyses a variety of
   baseline sociodemographic features, functional impairments, medical
   conditions, and social network factors were associated with APS use, in
   multivariable analysis only sociodemographic variables remained
   independent risk factors including low income (odds ratio [OR], 2.6;
   95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 3.9), nonwhite race (OR, 2.2; 95%
   CI, 1.3 to 3.7), and age older than 75 years at cohort inception (OR,
   1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.0).
   Conclusions: Prevalence of APS use by older adults is substantial, and
   sociodemographic features were the most compelling risk factors in our
   cohort. As the population ages, the number of older adults at risk for
   abuse, neglect, self-neglect, exploitation, and abandonment will
   increase; physicians will need to become familiar with APS referral
   pathways and mandatory reporting laws in their states.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
ID ASSESSMENT SCALE
AB Background. Education groups for people with schizophrenia have tended
   to concentrate on compliance with medication. This study examines
   impact on social behaviour and quality of life.
   Method. A catchment-wide service was set up for community-based
   patients. Patients who indicated an interest in education groups were
   randomly allocated to either an education group or a waiting list
   control group. Those who attended groups were compared with the control
   group.
   Results. About one-quarter of community-based patients showed interest
   in attending education groups. Those who attended showed no change in
   mental state or compliance with medication (already high) but
   significant gains in quality of life, social functioning and social
   networks.
   Conclusions. For patients who choose to attend education groups
   significant gains in social functioning and quality of life are
   possible without specific skills training.

AB Background. The effectiveness of social skills training/social network
   restructuring in the primary and secondary prevention of drug use was
   examined in a multiethnic cohort of 296 female adolescents ages 14 to
   19 years who were pregnant or parenting and/or at risk for drug use.
   Methods. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (a)
   PALS Skills Training or (b) a control intervention involving no skills
   training. PALS Skills Training is a combination of cognitive and
   behavioral techniques to improve social skills and to restructure the
   teens' social network. All students also participated in a Is-week
   normative education ''Facts of Life'' course.
   Results. The prevalence of alcohol and any drug use increased
   significantly over the three assessment periods in the PALS Skills
   group but not in the No Skills group, Teens in the PALS Skills group
   who reported no drug use at baseline were 2.9 times as likely to be
   using marijuana than teens in the No Skills group at 3 months
   postintervention. PALS Skills Training was no more effective in the
   secondary prevention of drug use than the control intervention.
   Conclusions. Social skills training was found to be ineffective as a
   means of primary prevention among non-drug-using high-risk adolescents
   and may even be counterproductive as a means of primary prevention of
   marijuana use in this population. When combined with normative
   information on drug use prevalence, acceptability, and hazards, social
   skills training is no more effective as a means of secondary prevention
   than normative education alone. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

AB This study examined the formation of nonkin relationships in widowhood,
   using personal network data from 548 older men and women who lost a
   partner through death fewer than 10 years earlier. Relationships
   established after the death of the spouse were cited by 27.6% of the
   respondents. New relationships with neighbors were cited in particular.
   New relationships were more often nominated by women than by men.
   Formation of new relationships was strongly and positively associated
   with the duration of widowhood, the presence of a new partner. and
   having put effort into seeking new relationships. The findings suggest
   that, to gain a proper understanding of why some widowed individuals
   form new relationships and others do not, knowledge is required about
   the quality of the social network prior to widowhood.

TI The exclusion of never-married women from Chinese fertility surveys
SO STUDIES IN FAMILY PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR; UNITED-STATES; ABORTION; TAIWAN
AB Never-married women have been regularly excluded in official national
   surveys of fertility in China, even in light of evidence of increasing
   premarital sexual activity. Likewise, never-married women in the United
   States were consistently excluded from national fertility surveys prior
   to 1982 because of the perceived sensitivity of questions about
   contraceptive use and sexual activities. Data on sexual fertility
   behavior from all women of reproductive age, regardless of marital
   status, can provide direct measures of sexual activity and unintended
   pregnancies, as well as facilitate modeling of social networks
   underlying the sexual transmission of diseases. China's need for such
   information, however sensitive, will become more difficult to ignore
   given increasing pressures to attend to the health needs of their
   never-married but sexually active population.

   INTERDEPENDENCE; FLOW
AB Threshold models have been postulated as one explanation for the
   success or failure of collective action and the diffusion of
   innovations. The present paper creates a social network threshold model
   of the diffusion of innovations based on the Ryan and Gross (1943)
   adopter categories: (1) early adopters; (2) early majority; (3) late
   majority; (4) laggards. This new model uses social networks as a basis
   for adopter categorization, instead of solely relying on the
   system-level analysis used previously. The present paper argues that
   these four adopter categories can be created either with respect to the
   entire social system, or with respect to an individual's personal
   network. This dual typology is used to analyze three diffusion datasets
   to show how external influence and opinion leadership channel the
   diffusion of innovations. Network thresholds can be used (1) to vary
   the definition of behavioral contagion, (2) to predict the pattern of
   diffusion of innovations, and (3) to identify opinion leaders and
   followers in order to understand the two-step flow hypothesis better.

   VULNERABILITY; DISORDERS; VARIABLES; AMERICAN; SEASON; STATE
AB The predictive value of electrodermal activity and social network was
   examined among 48 consecutively admitted schizophrenic patients. The
   patients were followed from an initial admission, through hospital
   stay, discharge, follow-up (M = 31 months), and possible relapse.
   Outcome variables were the length of stay in the hospital at the key
   episode and time to relapse, defined as a marked exacerbation or return
   of schizophrenic symptoms requiring inpatient or expansion of
   outpatient treatment. Multivariate analyses showed that a psychosocial
   variable, the availability of attachment, was the only independent
   predictor of length of stay in the hospital. Age at admission was a
   strong predictor of time to relapse. Age interacted with both outcome
   and electrodermal activity, and young electrodermal nonresponders were
   found to have the shortest time to relapse. At the I-year followup, a
   main relapse effect was found for patients with a low skin conductance
   level.

AB Freedom and responsibility, how much of each and how they sue balanced,
   have profound implications for our personal lives and for our work, The
   health of a population and its achievement in the workplace are
   enhanced when individuals have some freedom and some responsibility,
   but not too much of either, and when civil associations of individuals
   rather than individuals acting alone are the essential social units.
   The consistent association of social contacts with health and
   productivity provides strong support for the premise that intimate
   relationships are the focus around which people's lives revolve.
   Membership of a ''social network'' may be merely conforming to a
   reigning social norm, and this could mean having to pay an important
   price in the loss of creativity associated with individualism. But
   social conformity should not prevent individuals from going their own
   way, and it should be possible to combine the luxury of individuality
   with an active life in civic affairs. Less than complete freedom may
   fall short of existential utopia, but it may be best for our health and
   wellbeing.

AB If the usual correspondence analysis is viewed as a decomposition of
   departures from the model of independence, there are problems in
   applications to sociomatrices with regard to the treatment of the
   diagonal and cell estimates under independence. Other related
   techniques from the literature are more appropriate for analysis of
   sociomatrices. The different approaches are used to analyze a familiar
   sociomatrix, and the results of the techniques are compared.

AB Bourdieu's analysis of class and culture errs in neglecting two
   important aspects of social structure: social networks and class
   relations at work. He expects high-status culture to be useful in class
   because it is correlated with class, but culture used at work includes
   both genres related to class (used in domination) and genres unrelated
   to class (used in coordination). High-status culture is correlated with
   class but excluded, not used, in the competitive private sector. The
   most widely useful cultural resource is cultural variety, and social
   network variety is a better source of cultural variety than is class
   itself.

AB The processes by which children with emotional and behavioral disorders
   seek and obtain help have received little study; yet, they are critical
   for determining mental health policy and practice. In this article,
   help seeking pathways for children are defined and a pathway model is
   presented. Influences on help-seeking pathways are then reviewed,
   including illness profile variables, predisposing factors, and barriers
   to and facilitators of care. Research targets such as the role of
   informal supports, collateral services, and cultural influences on
   help-seeking are recommended. Methodological considerations are
   presented that include assessment of clinically defined mental health
   need as well as subjective assessment of need, use of complementary
   qualitative and quantitative methods, and use oi cross-system data. The
   implications for practice and policy of research on help-seeking
   pathways are described.

AB Based on the existing empirical evidence that psychosocial variables
   may predict the course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) illness,
   disease progression (described by advance in symptoms, decline in CD4+
   cell count, and mortality) in 414 HIV-positive (HIV+) males was studied
   using Cox Proportional Hazards Models (survival analysis). Depressive
   symptoms predicted shorter longevity after controlling for symptoms and
   CD4+ cell count. Large social network sizes predicted longevity among
   those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining symptoms
   at baseline, but not among other subjects. Therefore, psychosocial
   valuables and affective states may be related to disease outcome only
   during later stages of HIV disease. Although the results provide
   support for psychoneuroimmunologic effects in HIV other. confounding
   explanations may still apply.

AB This paper outlines a method for collecting accurate 'peer' data by
   using two name generator and 13 name interpreter questions to collect
   'friend' and 'pal' data from teenagers. The 'peer' data are then used
   to identify the complete network and to delineate the naturally
   existing peer networks in it. The findings suggest that the concept
   'friend' should not be avoided when collecting 'friend' data.

LA English
DT Article
DE Germany; mainports; Baltic seaports; containerisation; hinterland
   links; value-added logistics
AB German seaports are in a phase of far-reaching structural change,
   Increasing globalisation of the economy has led to growing
   international trade volume and a corresponding increase in transport
   streams. Economic changes are particularly marked in the Baltic region
   which affects, above all, the German Baltic seaports, The two large
   container ports of Hamburg and Bremen/Bremerhaven are primarily faced
   with economic and technical-organisational changes in intercontinental
   container transport, Restructuring of the ports is currently governed
   by an adjustment of port infrastructures to the changed requirements of
   transport and services, and an extension of hinterland relations.
   Changes in the institutional and financial structures of German ports
   are Likely in view of the chronic crisis situations of public budgets
   and the attempts of the European Commission to apply the principle of
   spreading costs fairly to all European ports, on the basis of
   standardised cost recording and accounting. The introduction of
   containers resulted in spiralling labour productivity, with a
   consequent loss in jobs in the operative core area of the port economy,
   In view of this forced logistic structural change ports become
   'container floodgates', a 'logistic channel' through which cargo
   passes. Most port regions are attempting to counteract the job decline
   in the operative function sector carried out by the seaport through
   developing the services offered towards ''value-added logistics''. The
   functional changes of ports modify economic linkages of ports and
   regions, The immediate Linkages of ports and sea-oriented industries
   are decreasing and differentiated economic and social networks are
   emerging in the shape of transport and logistic service centres,
   although their interlinked relations are no longer one-sidedly
   port-based.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the sociodemographic and clinical
   variables associated with life satisfaction in psychiatric patients.
   The study population consisted of out-patients and in-patients (n =
   1204) treated at the Department of Psychiatry of Kuopio University
   Hospital in North Save, Finland, during May 1993. Sociodemographic,
   psychosocial and clinical correlates of life satisfaction were examined
   by means of two different questionnaires, one directed at patients and
   the other directed at the staff. Life satisfaction was assessed by
   means of a separate scale based on four questions. Patients with
   schizophrenia were less dissatisfied than patients with other
   disorders. The strongest correlates of dissatisfaction were depression
   and poor social support. Other factors relating to dissatisfaction in
   multiple regression analysis were self-rated health and poor financial
   circumstances. A psychosomatic reaction tendency or degree of
   psychosocial functioning at the time of the study was not independently
   related to life satisfaction. Psychiatric patients who are dissatisfied
   should be evaluated both for depression and for effectiveness of their
   social network.

AB The divorce rate in the United States has risen over the years until
   today there are many households that are headed by single females.
   Single-parent families' purchase decisions, however, have not been
   studied in depth in the marketing discipline. This paper examines
   social network influence in terms of the role of marital status in
   purchase decisions. Of particular interest is the influence of social
   network members' input in the purchase decisions of single mothers.
   Propositions are considered and the implications for marketers, if
   these propositions prove to be true, are discussed.

AB The relation between adolescents' personality, various competence
   indices, and the mutuality of their self-descriptions and descriptions
   of them provided by important interaction partners was studied in two
   samples of adolescents (12- and 14-years-old). Mutuality (a
   Q-correlation, reflecting self-other agreement between a
   self-description and a description provided by an important other)
   increased with age and was higher for girls. Extraversion and Emotional
   Stability were not related to mutuality, Agreeableness and
   Conscientiousness were related to mutuality at age 12, and Openness was
   related to mutuality at both ages, Mutuality was further related to
   competence indices at both ages. Mutuality with the main interaction
   partner in a setting was the most important for competence in that
   specific setting. These results illustrate the important role for the
   development of competence of the communication with significant
   interaction partners and of the adolescent's embeddedness in a social
   network.

AB In this study, factors related to analgesic use-independent of their
   association with pain-were studied in the general Swedish population.
   These included sociodemographics, health and health-related factors,
   physical fitness and working conditions.
   Data from the Swedish Survey of Living Conditions for the two-year
   period 1988/89 were used. In this survey a random sample (n = 13,295,
   response rate 79.4%) of the Swedish population aged 16 years and older
   was interviewed about health, medication use and related matters, among
   other things.
   In all, 35% of the population used analgesics at least once during a
   two-week period, and analgesic use was more than 50% higher among women
   than men. Analgesic use was less common among those aged 45-64 years
   and 65-74 years than those 18-44, after controlling for all other
   variables.
   The study showed that self-perceived poor health and pain explain much
   analgesic use. Analgesic use is further explained by lifestyle,
   sleeping problems, and health care utilization. Marital status,
   educational level, socioeconomic status, social network and working
   conditions were found to de of minor importance. (C) 1996 Elsevier

AB This study explored the social affiliations of students in three
   mainstream classrooms containing students receiving general education
   services, students characterized as academically gifted, students with
   learning disabilities, and students with emotional and behavioral
   disorders. The study provided an in-depth description of the the
   classrooms' social networks, focusing on the social and demographic
   characteristics that distinguished clusters of students. Findings
   showed that students formed distinct peer clusters around shared
   characteristics; particular social characteristics were associated with
   a student's level of centrality, in the classroom; and student's with
   exceptionalities were well integrated into the classroom's social
   structure. Affiliations of students with exceptionalities suggest
   topics for future research.

DE cultural ageing; attitudes towards ageing; incomes; health and care
   access in later life
ID MORAL ECONOMY; OLDEST OLD; LATER LIFE; HEALTH; MORTALITY; DISABILITY;
   STATES; TRENDS; PEOPLE; CARE
AB The absence of old age as a specific social group in some cultures
   raises the question of ageing as a cultural construction. In this paper
   we will consider only problems of cultural ageing in industrial Western
   society and especially in some OECD countries. There, demographic
   changes have been characterised by ageing of populations, visible since
   the fifties, by feminization of later life and modifications of social
   network. Ageing of population including the oldest generations have
   made definitions of later life more politicised and have gone together
   with new attitudes towards ageing and elderly people giving rise to
   different patterns of ageism. Examination of incomes, health status,
   social support of the elderly shows that until today there have been
   persistent inequalities related to age, gender and social class in
   terms of resources, access to informal and formal care and value
   accorded to later life. These inequalities are due to differences in
   status and resources of elderly and trajectories of ageing, always
   conditioned by social locations: position in labour market and in
   domestic division of labour with resulting social relations. The
   differences vary also between countries according to their welfare
   regime and their social policy. In the future, the proportion of those
   over 65 of age and among them of those over 80 will be greater raises
   the questions of health status of the oldest generations, income
   distribution among generations and genders, of access to informal and
   formal care anc: adequacy of the later for the frail elderly. To cope
   with those issues ageing and later life should be considered in a
   life-span perspective. Better sharing of jobs and of economic wealth,
   development of meaningful activities other than work may be solutions
   to answer to the questions addressed by an ageing population and the
   problems of later life. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This article describes change and stability in self-rated health after
   a major medical event. Using a prospective design, it examines the
   ability of premorbid and post-illness health perceptions to predict
   physical disability independently of medical, psychosocial, and
   behavioral variables. Participants (N = 254) were a subsample of the
   New Haven cohort of the Established Populations for Epidemiologic
   Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) project wire Rad survived
   hospitalization for stroke, myocardial infarction, or hip fracture.
   Data came from premorbid EPESE interviews, medical records, and
   interviews at 6 weeks and at 6 months after hospitalization. Health
   perceptions did not universally decline after the illness. Self-rated
   health at 6 weeks predicted disability al 6 months, but premorbid
   self-rated health did not, suggesting that illness-related changes in
   health perceptions influenced the recovery process. The effects of
   6-week self-rated health on disability were independent of physical
   inactivity. The mechanisms by which health perceptions influence
   recovery are unclear.

ID ILLNESS; CARE; SYSTEMS
AB This article presents an empirical approach which views mental health
   service systems as interorganizational networks. Data are reported on
   two county-based child mental health systems in North Carolina that
   participated in the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Mental Health
   Services Program for Youth. Analyses are based on a structural
   equivalence approach which groups organizations on the basis of
   similarity in their patterns of interaction. Site-specific data were
   collected at two time points (1991 and 1993) to measure the social
   network structure of these service systems including their density,
   fragmentation, and centralization. Findings indicate that two
   interesting changes occurred in these systems of care. First, each
   system moved in a direction consistent with the goals of the RWJF
   demonstration program, in that they were better organized by the end of
   the demonstration. Second, while the two systems started at very
   different levels of system development, one site made significantly
   larger gains, such that the systems converged over time toward
   moderately high levels of system organization at the end of the
   demonstration. Implications for further research are discussed. (C)

AB The investigation of peer influences on children's development in
   natural settings rests squarely on appropriate methods to identify
   those individuals who are influential for a given child. Traditional
   methods of sociometric ratings or assessments of friendship choices are
   not intended to identify reciprocal influences in children's peer
   groups of social interrelationships. In the study of networks within
   sociology, researchers have focused on the structural properties of
   children's networks, instead of the psychologically meaningful
   characteristics of the children who comprise a target child's network.
   To complement these strategies, a method is presented that can reliably
   identify those individuals who constitute children's natural peer
   groups in a setting. This information is used to form composite maps
   that represent the psychological peer context of a given child.
   Strategies are outlined for analyzing processes of group selection and
   socialization among developing individuals and their changing peer
   contexts.

SO COMPARATIVE POLITICS

DT Article
AB Economic crises increased poverty and exacerbated social inequality in
   Latin America in the 1980s but did not empower parties of the Left and
   their affiliated social movements. Although the legal Left in Peru in
   1980 was a formidable social and political force, by the early 1990s it
   was eclipsed by the Shining Path insurgency and the autocratic
   neoliberalism of President Alberto Fujimori. The crisis undermined the
   conditions for class-based collective action and fragmented the social
   networks that sustained the support of the United Left coalition. The
   United Left was also polarized in competing camps as different parties
   and leaders adopted divergent strategic responses to the national
   crisis. The collapse of partisan representation created a political
   void highly conducive to new forms of personalist leadership.

AB Conditions for the development of cities are changing globally:
   economic structural change, the uncertain impact of new information
   technology, unsolved ecological problems, a transformation in lifestyle
   and modes of existence, migration resulting from poverty and political
   instability - all characterise the situation. Moreover, in the
   multimedia age, the time honoured centrality of the city is under
   threat from an 'abstract urbanism', whereby virtual cities are
   increasingly eclipsing the real cities. This has adverse consequences
   for the survival of the traditional European city, whose historical
   structures are in danger of becoming a meaningless backdrop. At the
   same time, the limits to urban planning are apparent; reliable models
   are lacking. Yet there remains the need to determine objectives to
   bring about constructive solution in the major areas of urban life.
   Three key fields of action are identified: mobility, communications,
   and transport are indispensable functions of the city; the traditional
   service of the city in providing a social network should be maintained;
   through ecological restructuring, the aim should be to adapt the urban
   structures to the demands of ecological compatibility. The question of
   the future of the European city remains open. If, during the transition
   to the information society, the city is to remain the site of cultural
   differentiation processes, then not only a clear political will, but
   also the commitment of the citizens is required.

AB Life satisfaction, measured using Neugarten's Life Satisfaction Scale,
   was examined in three samples of elderly people in London and Essex at
   baseline and at follow-up 2 1/2-3 years later. The analyses reported
   here relate to changes in life satisfaction. The previously reported
   baseline analyses showed that poor health and functional ability were
   the strongest predictors of baseline life satisfaction. The results
   from the follow-up data presented here show that the most significant
   predictor of changes in life satisfaction at follow-up was baseline
   life satisfaction. While follow-up health and functional status, social
   network structure and activities explained the remainder of the
   explained variance, this was very little. The results are consistent
   with previous analyses of associations with changes in psychiatric
   morbidity (mainly depression) and highlight the importance of
   initiating early rehabilitation programmes.

AB At the core of the dependent personality disorder lies an excessive
   reliance on other people for support, direction, and nurturance.
   However, because of their interpersonal style, many patients high in
   dependency have difficulties establishing and maintaining close
   interpersonal relationships. The present study examined interpersonal
   problems related to the dependent personality disorder. The
   relationships between dependency and interpersonal problems were
   examined in 43 adult psychiatric inpatients and 66 nonpatient adults.
   All subjects were assessed for social functioning in terms of social
   behaviors typically displayed, density of their social networks, and
   subjective feelings of loneliness. Using correlations and multiple
   regression analyses, results showed that dependency was closely related
   to social behavior and quality of social networks for both psychiatric
   inpatients and nonpatient controls. Pearson correlations showed the
   dependent personality style was related to negative and disruptive
   interpersonal behaviors. Also, measures of social functioning were
   related to feelings of loneliness and depression. Finally,
   interpersonal dependency was strongly related to both depressive
   symptoms and depressive attitudes, especially in the psychiatric
   inpatients. The present findings demonstrate the importance of
   interpersonal dependency as related to interpersonal problems.

AB This research uses data collected on 57 married daughters and 1,069
   members of their social networks to examine patterns of social support
   and interpersonal stress across the first two years of caring for
   parents with dementia. Reports by the caregivers indicated that friends
   were the most prominent source of emotional support, while siblings
   were the greatest source of instrumental support and interpersonal
   stress, both shortly after the parents' diagnosis and two years later.
   Multivariate analyses demonstrated that associates who had cared for
   family members themselves were more likely to have been sources of
   instrumental support both shortly after diagnosis and two years later.
   Caregiving similarity was also the most important factor in explaining
   both emotional support and interpersonal stress at T1; however, its
   effect diminished across the subsequent two years. These findings
   suggest that experimental similarity may become less important in
   explaining some dimensions of interpersonal relations as individuals
   move further from status transitions.

   predicated on the need to reduce personal risk behaviors; that approach
   may not adequately reflect the complicated interplay between personal
   behaviors and the social setting in which they occur. Efforts to date,
   including the application of population ecology, the development of the
   core group hypothesis, and the use of compartment models to describe
   disease transmission, have aided in understanding the dynamics of
   transmission and have highlighted the relationship between personal
   risk taking and population risk. An area for further development is the
   application of the techniques of social network analysis to infectious
   disease spread. Initial work suggests that social structure may act as
   a barrier (or facilitator) in disease transmission and that the
   epidemiologic impact of a risky act varies with the social setting. The
   local context for risk behaviors has important implications for the
   dynamics of transmission.

AB Ecological perspectives emphasize social network influences on child
   rearing, but do these effects vary with ethnicity, and are they
   mediated by parental well-being? Low-income parents (N = 500) of
   ethnically and ecologically diverse backgrounds completed a
   multidimensional hierarchical social map and measures of parental
   self-esteem and child-rearing practices. Consistent with prior
   ethnographic studies, American Indians had frequent interchanges with
   an interconnected web of kin; Hispanic(1) parents had large, close-knit
   social networks but a smaller number of people who provided emotional
   support; and Angle parents had structurally diffuse but emotionally
   supportive networks. Within-ethnicity regression analyses, covarying
   psychosocial risk, revealed that the affective but not structural
   dimensions of social networks were consistently related to parenting.
   Parental self-efficacy was strongly related to child-rearing practices
   across all ethnic groups, and mediated the effects of social support.
   Implications for the social ecology of child rearing and the central
   role of parental self-appraisals are discussed.

ID REGULAR EQUIVALENCE; EXCHANGE NETWORKS; POWER; COLORINGS
AB A coloration is an exact regular coloration if whenever two vertices
   are colored the same they have identically colored neighborhoods. For
   example, if one of the two vertices that are colored the same is
   connected to three yellow vertices, two white and red, then the other
   vertex is as well. Exact regular colorations have been discussed
   informally in the social network literature. However they have been
   part of the mathematical literature for some time, though in a
   different format. We explore this concept in terms of social networks
   and illustrate some important results taken from the mathematical
   literature. In addition we show how the concept can be extended to
   ecological and perfect colorations, and discuss how the CATREGE
   algorithm can be extended to find the maximal exact regular coloration
   of a graph.

TI Cooperation in new service development: A social dynamic approach
SO ADVANCES IN SERVICES MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID BUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS; MARKETS
AB This article presents a social dynamic approach to cooperation in the
   development of new services that combines cognitive organizational
   theory and social network theory. A method is proposed to reveal and
   quantify communication networks as well as differences in the content
   of perceptions between organizational groups. In this way, a
   socio-cognitive configuration is created which can be used to identify
   and monitor hindrances in services innovation. Our approach, which is
   new to the field of services marketing, has been empirically tested in
   a project in which eight organizations cooperate in the development of
   a new information exchange service. Application of the social dynamic
   approach reveals an insight into the dynamics of service innovation
   projects. Implications for the management of these projects are
   discussed.

   CONSOLATION
AB Previous studies suggest that the tendency for primates to reconcile
   after agonistic conflict is related to the quality of relationships
   between opponents: the 'relationship quality' hypothesis. In addition,
   reconciliation frequency seems to covary with other social variables
   such as the rate of allogrooming, the intensity of aggression and the
   outcome of approaches: the 'systematic variation' hypothesis. It is
   proposed that such systematic variation should be present not only
   between different species but also between different groups of the same
   species. To test these hypotheses, data were collected from two large
   corral-housed groups of pigtail macaques, Macaca nemestrina, over 7
   months. The two groups lived in identical environments but one was well
   established, the other newly formed. In both groups, conflicts were
   more frequently reconciled between opponents with strong affiliative
   ties, as predicted by the relationship quality hypothesis. Members of
   the well-established group reconciled roughly twice as often as members
   of the newly formed group. Contrary to the predictions of the
   systematic variation hypothesis, other social variables did not vary
   between groups. Members of the well-established group, however,
   distributed their affiliative behaviour less evenly, focusing their
   efforts on a relatively small number of partners. The concentrated
   social networks in the well-established group apparently produced more
   intense ties, hence increasing the likelihood of reconciliation after
   conflict. These results show that detailed analyses of social networks
   provide a tool to investigate the systematic variation hypothesis when
   variation is subtle, such as between groups of the same species. The
   study confirms the relationship quality hypothesis at both the within-
   and between-group level, provides support for a more sophisticated
   concept of systematic variation, and illustrates the special usefulness
   of reconciliation measures as a gauge of social integration. (C) 1996

AB A comprehensive case-control study was conducted in an Italian region
   in order to compare the influence of family history of cardiovascular
   events, socioeconomic factors, social networks, and their joint
   associations with major risk factors, on the risk, of myocardial
   infarction (MI), unstable angina (UA) and ischemic stroke (IS). A total
   of 513 patients with MI, 178 with UA, 237 with IS, and 928 hospitalised
   controls were recruited. The odds ratio (OR) of MI for two or more
   relatives with a positive history of MI was 3.6 (95% CI: 1.8-7.3).
   Family history of MI was predictive for UA (OR = 5.8; 95% CI:
   1.2-28.7), but not for IS. A family history of stroke was more
   associated with the risk of MI than of IS. After adjustment for known
   risk factors, the OR of MI for more educated people was 2.1 (1.3-3.6)
   compared with less-educated people. Large family size seemed to be
   protective for MI. The effect of major risk factors on MI ranged from
   additive (diabetes) to multiplicative jointly with high education and
   family history of MI. A family history of stroke increased IS risk
   threefold jointly with smoking and hyperlipidemia, and eightfold with
   diabetes. Besides a family history of MI and IS, in this community a
   higher educational status seems to better identify groups at increased
   risk of MI. The joint associations have important preventive
   implications since by identifying high-risk individuals (for MI and IS)
   a more careful assessment and control of risk factors amenable to
   intervention may be performed.

AB The number of stressful life events experienced as measured on the
   modified Swedish version of Coddington's questionnaire, and the
   presence of behaviour problems assessed by Achenbach's Child Behavior
   Check List (CBCL) were studied in 45 eight-year-old children of
   identified psychosocial risk-mothers. The mothers' social network was
   estimated using the Swedish version of Unden and Orth-Gomer's Interview
   Schedule for Social Interaction (ISSI). These mothers had been
   identified during early pregnancy. A control group of 57 children of
   the same age and their mothers without the presence of psychosocial
   risk-criteria was used as reference.
   The results indicated that the index children had experienced
   significantly more life events, and displayed significantly more
   behaviour problems than the reference children. The mothers in the
   index group had a significantly poorer social network than the mothers
   in the reference group. The study suggests that children of mothers,
   identified early on psychosocial risk criteria develop suboptimally.
   Therefore, early interventions are of great importance.

AB Perceptions of the typical smoker (i.e., prototype) were assessed in a
   sample of 174 adult smokers when they first joined a cessation clinic
   and were used to predict smoking status at 6-month follow-up. As
   predicted, consistent with a prototype-based model of health risk
   behavior (F. X. Gibbons & M. Gerrard, 1995, in press), smokers with
   more favorable perceptions were more likely to have relapsed at
   follow-up. Also as predicted, this prospective effect was moderated by
   smokers' social networks: Prototypes did not predict status among those
   who had a lot of friends and family members who smoked, suggesting that
   these other smokers were inhibiting smokers' attempts to distance
   themselves psychologically from the prototype. Implications of the
   results for interventions that use prototypes to discourage smoking are
   discussed.

ID IDENTITY
AB This study examined the needs of lesbians in Brisbane, a state capital
   city of Australia, and the importance of lesbian ''community'' in
   meeting those needs. The extent to which a lesbian community can meet
   the needs of individual lesbians is dependent on what those needs are,
   the prevailing social climate, and the resulting degree of access by
   lesbians to the community. This study examined lesbians' perceptions of
   their individual needs and the extent to which they looked to their
   community to meet those needs. Overall, the results indicated that
   lesbians in Brisbane had many unmet needs which, in many instances, cut
   across the demographic spectrum of age, politics, stage of identity
   development, religious beliefs, occupation, and educational
   achievements. These can be broadly categorized as needs that related to
   the lesbian community itself and external needs that related to changes
   needed in heterosexual society. The results of this study indicated
   that characteristics of community do exist within the Brisbane lesbian
   subculture. There were distinct, identifiable, interacting small groups
   and social networks in existence. However, a common need was for an
   identifiable, accessible, lesbian community that could provide stable,
   long-term services and cultural and social activities. In Brisbane
   lesbians also needed a focus that superseded the needs of individual
   lesbians and their small interacting social networks. This study
   highlighted the need for further research into the area of lesbian
   community identity formation.

ID HEALTH BEHAVIOR
AB Predictors of change in domain-specific self-efficacy were examined in
   a sample of community-residing men and women aged 62 and older.
   Self-efficacy perceptions were assessed for eight domains of living:
   productivity, health, transportation, family relationships,
   relationships with friends, finances, safety, and living arrangements.
   Using pooled logistic regression models, both baseline and time-varying
   predictors of decline and improvement ire self-efficacy were examined.
   The results indicated that while demographic and health factors were
   predictive of decline in self-efficacy for some domains of living, the
   most consistent predictors of decline were psychosocial
   characteristics. Specifically, prior levels of depression were
   associated with decline in the transportation, family relationships,
   relationships with friends, financial, safety, and living arrangements
   domains of living. The presence of a domain-specific hassle was
   associated with a decline in self-efficacy for the
   transportation,family relationships, finances, and living arrangements
   domains. In addition, lower levels of social network contact were
   predictive of decline in the health and safety domains, and the absence
   of instrumental support was also associated with decline in the
   productivity, health, and transportation domains of living.
   Improvements in self-efficacy perceptions were associated with fewer of
   the health and psychosocial characteristics and were primarily
   influenced by the availability of financial and emotional support
   resources.

   time among stress (physiologic), distress (functional outcome), and
   resources (internal-well-being; external-social network), A secondary
   analysis was done on data from 112 persons with end stage renal
   disease, collected yearly over 3 years. Physiologic stressors were
   strongly associated with higher levels of physical dysfunction.
   Resources were generally unable to reduce deleterious effects of
   physiologic stress on functional outcomes; functional outcomes were
   largely determined by preexisting levels of function. (C) 1996 John

SO JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY

ID HISTORY
AB Analysis of a linguistic atlas reveals an ecological gradient in the
   diversity of languages in West Africa. As one moves south from arid
   into lusher ecoclimatic zones, the average size of ethnolinguistic
   groups decreases. Various factors are considered which may have
   contributed to this distribution. I argue that the ethnolinguistic map
   is primarily a reflection of the systems of generalized exchange and
   mutual dependence into which people enter. It is hypothesized that such
   social networks function to reduce subsistence risk due to variations
   in the food supply. If this hypothesis is correct, the average size of
   ethnolinguistic groups should be inversely proportional to the degree
   of ecological variability they face. This prediction is tested and
   found to hold strongly for a large part of West Africa. There is also
   Limited evidence of a correlation between Linguistic diversity and
   topography. It is concluded that ecological risk has been a key
   historical force in West Africa and that the ethnolinguistic mosaic can
   be used as a valuable ''fossil record'' of people's adaptive social and
   economic strategies. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

TI Caregiving as reciprocal exchange in families with seriously mentally

SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL NETWORKS; SUPPORT; SCHIZOPHRENIA
AB Caregiving for people with chronic illnesses, including serious mental
   illnesses, has generally been seen as support that a care provider
   gives to a dependent receiver. In contrast, this research views
   caregiving as a process of mutual exchange. It tests the hypothesis
   that how much support a mentally ill family member receives depends on
   how much support they provide to other family members. We also examine
   whether or not reciprocity depends oil the role relationship between
   recipients and providers of care, the level of patient symptomatology,
   coresidence, and several sociodemographic characteristics. The sample
   indicates 66 patients who have at least one sampled parent or sibling.
   The results indicate that the amount of support patients give parents
   and siblings is very strongly associated with how much support they
   receive from family members. In comparison to the other variables
   considered here, patient support provision is by far the best predictor
   of the amount of family support. These results indicate that it is
   worthwhile to examine caregiving in families with a member who is
   seriously mentally ill as a process of mutual exchange.

AB Seventy-five patients were admitted to the ward of the Lund Suicide
   Research Center following a suicide attempt. After 5 years, the
   patients were followed up by a personal semistructured interview
   covering sociodemographic, psychosocial and psychiatric areas. Ten
   patients (13%) had committed suicide during the follow-up period, the
   majority within 2 years. They tended to be older at the index attempt
   admission, and most of them had a mood disorder in comparison with the
   others. Two patients had died from somatic diseases; Forty-two patients
   were interviewed, of whom 17 (40%) had reattempted during the follow-up
   period, most of them within 3 years. Predictors for reattempt were
   young age, personality disorder, parents having received treatment for
   psychiatric disorder, and a poor social network. At the index attempt,
   none of the reattempters had diagnoses of adjustment disorders or
   anxiety disorders. At follow-up, reattempters had more psychiatric
   symptoms (SCL-90), and their overall functioning (GAF) was poor
   compared to those who did not reattempt. All of the reattempters had
   had long-lasting treatment (> 3 years) as compared to 56% of the
   others. It is of great clinical importance to focus on treatment
   strategies for the vulnerable subgroup of self-destructive reattempters.

AB The social networks, social supports, family environment and adjustment
   of 36 fifth and sixth grade preadolescents, 15 with mild mental
   retardation, and 21 without mental retardation were examined. Two
   interviews with the preadolescents and their families, using a battery
   of questionnaires, were conducted in the home. Results showed no group
   differences in the size of preadolescents' social networks. In terms of
   who they turn to for social support, preadolescents with mild mental
   retardation were more likely to turn to people in the home and adults
   outside the home for companionship, while preadolescents without mental
   retardation turned to peers. Further, the more negative the family
   environment, the more preadolescents turned to adults outside the home
   for emotional and problem solving support. lastly, preadolescents who
   received greater emotional and problem solving support from people in
   the home, experienced fewer adjustment problems. The importance of a
   positive family environment for providing needed emotional support and
   the implications of the lack of peer companionship for preadolescents
   with mild mental retardation, as they enter adolescence, is discussed.

TI The future of the city - Problems and perspectives
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB Conditions for the development of cities are changing globally:
   economic structural change, the uncertain impact of new information
   technology, unsolved ecological problems, a transformation in lifestyle
   and modes of existence, migration resulting from poverty and political
   instability - all characterise the situation. Moreover, in the
   multimedia age, the time honoured centrality of the city is under
   threat from an 'abstract urbanism', whereby virtual cities are
   increasingly eclipsing the real cities. This has adverse consequences
   for the survival of the traditional European city, whose historical
   structures are in danger of becoming a meaningless backdrop. At the
   same time, the limits to urban planning are apparent; reliable models
   are lacking. Yet there remains the need to determine objectives to
   bring about constructive solution in the major areas of urban life.
   Three key fields of action are identified: mobility, communications,
   and transport are indispensable functions of the city; the traditional
   service of the city in providing a social network should be maintained;
   through ecological restructuring, the aim should be to adapt the urban
   structures to the demands of ecological compatibility. The question of
   the future of the European city remains open. If, during the transition
   to the information society, the city is to remain the site of cultural
   differentiation processes, then not only a clear political will, but
   also the commitment of the citizens is required.

AB Forty-five women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and their
   partners have been interviewed three months before and one year after
   surgical treatment to investigate the social consequences of their
   impairment. One year after surgery 76% of the women reported that they
   were cured (group A, n=34) and 24% that they were improved (group B,
   n=11). The cured women were significantly younger than the improved
   women. The duration of urinary leakage before the operation was
   significantly shorter in group A than in group B. One year post surgery
   group A reported a significantly decrease in impediments to exert
   certain tasks due to urine leakage. As concerns leisure time, group A
   reported a higher level of overall activities before surgery than group
   B, whereas postsurgery both groups obtained about the same level of
   activities.
   Regarding social support, no differences between the groups occurred as
   concerns attachment. Furthermore, group A women showed a significantly
   higher degree of adequacy of social integration compared with group B.
   The majority of the couples could openly discuss sexual matters with
   their partners and were satisfied with their sexual life. More than
   half of the interviewed men reported an increase in sexual desire one
   year after their partners operation. Whereas about every third woman in
   both groups reported an increase in sexual desire. However, the
   frequency of intercourse did not change in any groups.
   In conclusion, this study underlines the importance of social factors
   in the assessment of the consequences of stress urinary incontinence
   and its treatment. (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Non-reciprocated relationships, such as all workers knowing the
   president of the company but only a few of the workers being known by
   the president, and non-symmetric relationships, such as workers
   thinking that they know the president and thinking that the president
   does not know them, are endemic to most social situations. While such
   inconsistencies may be expected in relationships such as giving advice
   and lending money, they are rarely expected to occur in seemingly
   symmetric relationships such as friendship. Nevertheless, they do. We
   suggest that research in this area has been hampered by the confused
   language used for describing 'symmetries' and 'non-symmetries'. We
   present a framework for thinking about these relations that clearly
   distinguishes cognitive inconsistencies and non-symmetric and
   non-reciprocated, relations. Then, we employ this framework and
   constructural theory to suggest that owing to cognitive
   inconsistencies, any interaction-based relationship, including
   friendship, can potentially be non-symmetric. We examine a series of
   hypotheses concerning interaction and interaction-based behaviors that
   derive from this theory using friendship relations. We find that we are
   able to predict both who is friends with whom, non-symmetry in
   friendship, and non-reciprocities in the expectation for and recall of
   friendship.

TI Missing the connection: Social isolation and employment on the Brooklyn

SO SOCIAL PROBLEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Much of the recent literature on poverty assumes that the social and
   spatial isolation of impoverished inner city neighborhoods contributes
   to the poor job prospects of their residents. In this case study we
   examine a neighborhood, the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, New York, in
   which there is a concentration of poor people living in close proximity
   to blue-collar jobs. However, few local residents hold local jobs in
   the private sector. A survey of local employers revealed that most Red
   Hook jobs were filled via social networks that exclude local residents.
   Local residents, particularly African Americans, often lacked the
   serial capital - connections and references - needed to obtain these
   jobs. Further, many local employers considered Red Hook residents
   undesirable employees for a variety of reasons including ''place
   discrimination'' as well as racial discrimination. By contrast, public
   sector employers often preferred local residents, although their
   ability to hire them was limited by formal educational requirements.
   These findings lead us to question the efficacy of policies, such as
   ''empowerment zones,'' that assume that bringing jobs closer to where
   poor people live will necessarily improve their employment
   opportunities.

AB We explore relations between social network centrality and behavioral
   characteristics. Elementary school students nominated classmates for
   aggressivity, disruptiveness, popularity, studiousness, leadership,
   cooperativeness, athleticism, and shyness. Students had 1 of 4 levels
   of network centrality (i.e., nuclear, secondary, peripheral, isolated)
   and were in 1 of 4 educational classifications (i.e., academically
   gifted, emotionally and behaviorally disordered, general education,
   learning disabled), Across educational classifications for both boys
   and girls, nuclear students were athletic, cooperative, leaders,
   popular, and studious relative to lower centrality students. However,
   antisocial characteristics were associated with lower centrality for
   girls only. Aggressive behavior was positively associated with nuclear
   centrality for general education boys. Findings are considered in
   relation to sociometric status research and implications of the role of
   social network centrality in the establishment and maintenance of
   antisocial behavior are discussed.

AB Elsewhere we have presented a traveling-wave analysis of HIV
   transmission on a tightly self-interactive, geographically-focused core
   group social network (Wallace R. Soc. Sci. Med. 32, 847, 1991; Soc.
   Sci. Med. 33, 1155, 1991; Environ. Plan. A. 26, 767, 1994; Wallace R.
   and Fullilove M. Environ. Plan. A. 23, 1701 1991). Here we reanalyze
   the problem in probability space and recover a close analog of the
   Shannon Coding Theorem of information theory. Subsequent direct
   application of information-theoretic methods provides striking insight
   regarding the spread of disease along the sociogeographic networks of
   marginalized subgroups, suggesting that 'risk behaviors' for infection
   may constitute essential components of a behavioral code for the
   transmission of information within the noisy channel of a marginalized
   community's social networks. The code's form, including the
   incorporation of risk behaviors, arises as a direct consequence of the
   external oppressive forces which structure marginalization.
   This viewpoint suggests an explanation of the sometime-observed rapid
   transmission of both infection and of control strategies for infection
   along the same network, but suggests further that if risk behaviors are
   indeed parts of a behavioral code for the transmission of group norms,
   statements of individual worth or resource sharing, then high rates of
   relapse are inevitable, given the persistence of the external
   oppression which gives those behaviors symbolic value.
   We suggest that violent acts in particular may emerge as key behavioral
   symbols for 'sending a message' in socially disorganized communities,
   implying that school-based or other individual-oriented harm reduction
   strategies for violence prevention, in the absence of a comprehensive,
   multifactorial reform program, cannot significantly reverse the effects
   of continuing economic and social constraints or of public policies of
   planned shrinkage and benign neglect, factors primarily responsible for
   the disorganization of urban minority communities within the United
   States. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB In this paper, we examine the relationships between social network
   characteristics, personal empowerment, social support, and adaptation
   of psychiatric consumer/survivors. Using path model analyses, we found
   that: (1) personal empowerment had statistically significant direct
   effects on positive affect, meaningful activity, and negative affect;
   (2) positive social support mediated the relationship between the
   proportion of women in consumer/survivors' networks and positive affect
   and meaningful activity; and (3) negative social interaction mediated
   the relationship between consumer/survivors' gender and negative
   affect. The results point out the importance of gender effects in
   social support processes, the differential association between type of
   social interaction (positive vs negative) and adaptation indices
   (positive vs negative), and the importance of personal empowerment for
   consumer/survivors' adaptation. We discuss the findings in terms of
   their implications for further research and community-based housing
   programmes for psychiatric consumer/survivors. Copyright (C) 1996

AB A random sample of non-institutionalised Swedish elderly (n=1,062; aged
   67+) were interviewed in 1954. All of them are now deceased; their
   interview data have been completed with dates of death and causes of
   death. A measure of survival capacity has been used, based on the
   endured total mortality risk from examination until death, according to
   life Cables from Statistics Sweden. Survival analyses were performed by
   gender on the whole sample and on a number of sub-samples defined by
   age, health-status, social class, and marital status at examination.
   Physical health status and activity patterns had the overall most
   significant effects on subsequent longevity. Among the youngest elderly
   mental health was, however, even more important as a predictor of
   survival than was physical health. The impact of most other factors
   like social networks, mobility, and religiosity was of less magnitude,
   but their importance varied among sub-samples. Most of the variation in
   survival, however, remains unexplained.

TI Psychosocial resources and persistent smoking in early pregnancy - A

AB Study objective - To test the stress hypothesis by characterising women
   during their first pregnancy who continue to smoke in early pregnancy
   in comparison with women who quit smoking, with special reference to
   psychosocial factors like social network, social support, demands, and
   control in work and daily life.
   Design - The study is based on a cohort of primigravidas followed
   during pregnancy. Data were collected by self administered
   questionnaires during the pregnant womens) first antenatal visit at
   about 12 weeks.
   Setting - The study was performed in the antenatal clinics in the city
   of Malmo, Sweden.
   Participants - The participants were all primigravidas living in the
   city of Malmo, Sweden, over a one year period, 1991-92. A total of 872
   (87.7%) of the 994 invited women agreed to participate. The population
   of this study on smoking includes all primigravidas who at the time of
   conception were smoking (n=404, 46.3%).
   Main results - At the first antenatal visit (63.6% (n=257) of the
   prepregnancy smokers were still smoking (a total smoking prevalence of
   29.5%). The pregnant smokers were on average younger and had a lower
   educational level. The highest relative risk (RR) of continued smoking
   was found among unmarried women RR 2.7 (95% confidence interval) (1.5,
   4.8), women having unplanned pregnancies RR 2.2 (1.2, 4.0) and those
   with a low social participation RR 1.6 (1.0, 2.7), low instrumental
   support RR 2.6 (1.2, 6.0), low support from the child's father RR 2.1
   (1.0, 4.2) and those exposed to job strain RR= 2.3 (1.1,4.8). The
   associations were independent of potential confounders such as age,
   educational level, nationality, cohabiting status, passive smoking, and
   previous years of smoking.
   Conclusions - This study supports the stress hypothesis. Smoking can be
   one way women handle stress when demands become too great. In order to
   reduce smoking among pregnant women, maternity centre resources need to
   be focused more on women with low psychosocial resources who are at
   highest risk for continued smoking. It is also important to involve
   actively the woman's partner or other important people in the woman's
   social network.

TI Help-seeking for alcohol-related problems: Social contexts surrounding
   entry into alcoholism treatment or alcoholics anonymous
SO JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL

   RECOVERY
AB Objective: The role of problem drinkers' social contexts in
   help-seeking patterns was investigated using recent entrants into
   outpatient alcoholism treatment or Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).
   Untreated, active problem drinkers served as controls. Merited:
   Subjects (N = 45, with 15 per group; 62% male) were recruited from the
   community. Habitual drinking practices, social network characteristics,
   social support, help-seeking barriers and incentives, and event
   occurrences during the 2 years prior to help-seeking were assessed
   during structured interviews. Collaterals verified subject reports.
   Results: Alcohol-related psychosocial problems and social network
   characteristics specific to drinking and help-seeking differentiated
   the groups, whereas drinking practices, general measures of social
   support and event occurrences did not. Both groups who sought help
   reported less network encouragement to drink, more network
   encouragement to seek help and greater alcohol-related psychosocial
   problems compared to untreated problem drinkers. AA participants also
   received more conflicting messages about seeking help than did
   treatment participants, and features of AA variously attracted and
   repelled different problem drinkers. Conclusions: The findings indicate
   the importance of separating alcohol-specific social influences on
   help-seeking from more general social contextual variables and provide
   a social basis for distinguishing the appeal of AA from that of formal
   treatment. The results generally concur with studies of help-seeking
   for other medical and psychological disorders and support a common
   approach that emphasizes the social nature of help-seeking and focuses
   on functional rather than structural influences.

AB Six-year predictors of successful aging were analyzed for 356 Alameda
   County Study men and women aged 65-95 years measured prospectively in
   1984 and followed to 1990, Successful aging was defined as needing no
   assistance nor having difficulty on any of 13 activity/mobility
   measures plus little or no difficulty on five physical performance
   measures. After adjusting for baseline successful aging, sex, and age,
   the authors found that 1984 predictors of 1990 successful aging
   included income above the lowest quintile (odds ratio (OR) = 2.01, 95%
   confidence interval (Cl) 0.99-4.11), greater than or equal to 12 years
   of education (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 0.98-2.84), white ethnicity (OR = 2.12,
   95% Cl 0.93-4.86), diabetes (OR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.79), chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.17-0.97), arthritis
   (OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.26-0.71), and hearing problems (OR = 0.48, 95% CI
   0.25-0.89). Adjusting for all variables, the authors found that
   behavioral and psychosocial predictors included the absence of
   depression (OR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.10-3.42), having close personal
   contacts (OR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.05-3.18), and often walks for exercise
   (OR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.00-3.12). Cross-sectional comparisons at follow-up
   revealed significantly higher community involvement, physical activity,
   and mental health for those aging successfully.

AB It is commonly assumed that bringing together caregivers with other
   persons who have been through the caregiving experience is highly
   beneficial. However, research has not established the degree to which
   such ''experientially similar'' others benefit caregivers. We analyzed
   data from a study of 254 individuals earing for relatives with
   Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder and 2,659 members of their
   social networks. The presence of experientially similar individuals in
   the caregivers' social networks was strongly associated with lower
   levels of depression, especially for persons in more stressful
   caregiving situations. We discuss possible explanations for this
   effect, and suggest implications of the findings for future research
   and practice.

AB Existence of friendship and friendship network characteristics were
   examined among children who differed in popularity status using a
   relatively unrestricted friendship nomination procedure. Fifth and
   sixth graders (N = 227) completed a rating-scale sociometric to index
   popularity and provided information on up to 15 good friends. Results
   indicated that all children reported having at least one unilateral
   friend. Unpopular children were less likely than popular children to
   have at least one reciprocal friend, although the large majority (77%)
   did have a reciprocal friend. Results also indicated that unpopular
   children's unilateral friendship networks, in comparison to the
   networks of their more popular peers, contained a greater number of
   younger school-age friends and fewer same-age friends, more friends
   located outside of the school but within the same school district, and
   more unpopular and fewer popular school friends. Unpopular children's
   reciprocal friendship networks were significantly smaller, were more
   evenly distributed within and outside of the classroom, and contained
   fewer average and popular friends as well as friends of the opposite
   sex. Findings suggest advantages to using an unrestricted friendship
   nomination instrument and emphasize the need to consider both
   popularity and friendship when investigating children's peer
   relationships.

AB WE EXPLORED THE ASSOCIATION between social factors and adult
   periodontitis by comparing self-reported information for daily strains
   and symptoms of depression in 71 cases and 77 controls. Cases and
   controls were selected from among 1,426 participants in the Erie County
   Risk Factor Study. We found differences among those who scored higher
   than their peers on measures of social strain. The odds ratio (OR) and
   95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association between case
   status and Role Strain score of 2.27 or more was 2.84, 95% CI = 1.08 to
   7.46. We also examined serum antibody, dichotomized at the median, for
   three periodontal pathogens (Bacteroides forsythus [IgG Bf],
   Porphyromonas gingivalis [IgG Pg], Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans
   [IgG Aa]), and assessed interaction between antibody levels and a
   Depression score derived from the Brief Symptom Inventory, IgG Pg and
   IgG Aa were both strongly associated with case status (OR = 4.52, 95%
   CI = 1.99 to 10.3 and OR = 5.29, 95% CI = 2.34 to 12.0, respectively),
   IgG Bf was associated with periodontal disease but only among
   individuals who had higher scores for Depression (OR = 6.75, 95% CI =
   1.25 to 36.5). Smoking status was associated with case status (OR =
   4.95, 95% CI = 1.85 to 13.2). We assessed these findings prospectively
   by examining factors associated with more extensive disease among the
   71 case subjects after 1 year of follow-up. We found baseline smoking
   status and IgG Bf among individuals scoring high on Depression at
   baseline to be associated with more extensive disease (8.1% or more of
   the sites showing further breakdown), In this population an elevated
   Depression score may be a marker for social isolation, which could play
   a role in immune function during periods of social strain. This
   exploratory analysis has served to identify specific lines of inquiry
   concerning psychosocial measures as important environmental factors in
   adult periodontitis.

AB Social influence processes have been found to affect numerous drug and
   health-related behaviors. We postulated that by using a
   network-oriented intervention it may be possible to capitalize on
   social influence processes to reduce human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
   risk behaviors. The present study used an experimental study design for
   delivering a psychoeducational acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
   (AIDS) preventive intervention to injection drug soaring networks.
   Participants were recruited from the ALIVE study, an epidemiological
   study in Baltimore. In the present paper we examine the self-reported
   behavioral outcomes of 117 injection drug users 18 months after the
   baseline interview HIV seronegative experimental participants reported
   significantly less frequent needle sharing and less injecting of heroin
   and cocaine than controls. In multiple logistic regression models of
   HIV seronegative participants, there was a significant negative
   association between assignment to the experimental group and the
   HIV-related behaviors of needle snaring and sharing of cookers in the
   prior 6 months; controls were 2.8 times more likely than experimentals
   to report needle sharing and were 2.7 times more likely to report
   sharing cookers. The results of this 18-month follow-up suggest that
   among injection drug users network-oriented interventions may be a
   promising approach to HIV prevention.

SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A
LA English
DT Article
ID CORRUPTION; REFORM
AB In this paper we explore how foreign investors penetrate China's
   reforming economy and seek to build a competitive edge for their
   operations in local and international markets. Basing our study on a
   comparative analysis of the locational, sectoral, and organizational
   characteristics and performance variation of industrial firms invested
   by overseas Chinese and other foreign capital, we posit that effective
   manipulation of state action holds a key to the economic success of
   foreign-invested firms in post-Mao China. The role of social networks
   in influencing the selection and outcomes of foreign investors'
   strategies, which is emphasized by some existing studies, should be
   assessed not only in terms of its importance to market transactions,
   but more importantly, in terms of its utility in gaining ad hoc
   redistributive advantages and minimizing or containing unfavorable
   treatments from the still potent yet increasingly porous and localized
   state apparatus. Disaggregate data from a national industrial firm data
   set and a survey on the investment activities of Hong Kong
   manufacturers in China are used to test hypotheses derived from
   case-study findings with respect to three existing perspectives on the
   subject.

AB Although the authors recognize that family-school policies have
   garnered considerable enthusiasm and support, they have serious
   reservations about these policies. In this article, they criticize the
   literature for its failure to come to grips with observable differences
   in parents' and guardians' educational skills, occupational and
   economic flexibility, social networks, and positions of power that they
   bring to home-school encounters. They illustrate their concerns with
   examples from a study that used ethnographic methods to explore the
   family-school relationships of White and African American children in
   third and fourth grade and conclude by discussing the implications for
   educational policy.

TI Kinship networks and discrete structure theory: Applications and
   implications
SO SOCIAL NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
AB Confusions between substantive and relational concepts of kinship as a
   social network have led to a number of problems that are clarified by a
   temporally ordered relational theory of network structure. The
   ordered-network approach gives rise to a novel means of graphing the
   social field of kinship relations, while allowing kinship to be locally
   defined in culturally relative terms. Its utility is exemplified in
   applications to kinships among US Presidents, Old Testament Canaanites,
   and native Australians of Groote Eylandt. The formal concepts treated
   in the mapping of kinship networks are: kinship axioms, parental graph
   structure, core, circuits of consanguineally and affinally linked kin,
   sides and divides, homeomorphic mappings, homomorphisms as potentially
   simplifying mappings of kinship, elementary structure, and
   order-structure. Representational theorems are proven about
   homeomorphisms, cores and circuits, and the ambiguity of elementary
   structures. The last set of theorems leads to clarifying and redefining
   some of the basic concepts of elementary, semi-complex and complex
   structures of kinship in terms of properties of generationally ordered
   networks. The conclusions of the formal argument are 'post-structural'
   in the narrow sense of demonstrating the need for specifying contingent
   historical processes in the structural analysis of kinship as a social
   field. The open-ended approach to change, one that is implied by the
   study of ordered structures that unfold in a temporal succession,
   connects to issues of population variability, selection, and
   evolutionary processes. The kinship structures that are mapped in this
   approach are not intended as any sort of complete representations of
   kinship 'systems', but merely as scaffoldings that help to bring into
   view kinship as a social field, providing a baseline for other mappings
   (which may be superimposed) of social processes such as communicative
   fields, exchange processes, transmission of learned behaviors, social
   rights and inheritance, political and religious succession, and the
   like.

AB Objectives. This study investigated the influence of psychosocial
   stress, maternal schooling, social support, psychological well-being,
   alcohol, and smoking on intrauterine growth retardation and premature
   delivery.
   Methods. At a Copenhagen university hospital, 2432 pregnant women
   completed a questionnaire on general health, psychosocial stressors,
   and sociodemographic characteristics.
   Results. In 212 cases (8.7%) the women delivered prematurely. Preterm
   delivery was associated with psychosocial stress (adjusted odds ratio
   [OR] = 1.14 for each 1-point increase on the psychosocial stressor
   5-point scale and 1.92 for the whole scale) and poor school education
   (adjusted OR = 2.62 for 7-9 years of schooling, 1.91 for 10 years, and
   1.0 for 11-13 years). In 152 cases (6.3%), infants had a birthweight
   below the 10th percentile. Intrauterine growth retardation was
   associated with smoking, daily drinking, school education, and social
   network variables. In a multiple logistic regression model,
   intrauterine growth retardation was associated with smoking habits
   (adjusted OR = 2.40 for 0-9 cigarettes daily, 2.68 for 10-15 daily, and
   2.88 for more than 15 daily).
   Conclusions. Psychosocial stressors and limited duration of schooling
   appeared to influence preterm delivery. Smoking habits influenced
   intrauterine growth retardation.

AB Although religious denominations have been shown to affect the drinking
   behavior of their members, few studies have examined this topic among
   Black Americans. The following study explored whether a model
   predicting drinking from religious denominations through a series of
   intervening cognitive and social variables (drinking attitudes and
   norms, social contexts, social networks, and home use of alcohol) would
   be the same for Blacks and Whites. The results showed that there are a
   number of racial differences in how religious background influences

AB For 830 62-year-old residents of the city of Malmo records of
   radiographic examinations made over a period of 40 years at the
   Radiological Department of Malmo General Hospital and/or over 20-30
   years at two private radiological departments in the city were
   reviewed. Radiographic examination had been undertaken in 92% of the
   residents, with on an average 16 examinations per resident. The most
   common examinations were of the chest in 63% of the residents followed
   by lower limb (58%) and spine (52%) examinations. In men the total
   number of radiographic examinations were negatively correlated to
   income, intelligence test results and social network and job
   satisfaction. Men with monotonous work and a more restricted latitude
   for decision-making at work, as well as men who were smokers had also
   had significantly more radiographic examinations. Single civil status
   and occupational work load had in men a positive correlation with the
   total number of radiographic examinations, as well as with serum levels
   of glutamyltransferase and uric acid levels. In women there was a
   negative correlation between radiographic examinations and teachers'
   rating of intelligence in childhood and bone mineral content, whereas
   job satisfaction, life success and triceps skinfold index (=
   subcutaneous fat tissue thickness) had a positive correlation with the
   total number of radiographic examinations. Women who took regular
   exercise (every week) had had significantly fewer radiographic
   examinations. Men and women with locomotor discomfort bad a
   significantly higher consumption of not only musculoskeletal
   radiographic examinations but also other radiographic examinations.

TI An episode of syncope attacks in adolescent schoolgirls:
   Investigations, intervention and outcome
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB An increasing number of students in a secondary convent girls school
   developed syncope attacks over a time course of about two months.
   Fourteen students who suffered from syncope and 12 other students from
   the same class with no symptoms were assessed by a team of
   psychologists and paediatricians with the aim of identifying the cause
   of the problem and to formulate possible,remedial action. Psychological
   assessments included a mental state examination, developmental,
   personal and psychological history, state-trait anxiety, self-esteem,
   hypnotic suggestibility, and students' beliefs about the cause and
   nature of the syncope attacks. Physical investigations included
   physical examination, blood pressure and electro-cardiogram. The
   results indicated that most participants and controls had no physical
   or psychological pathologies. The two groups were not different on the
   physical and psychological measures. Analyses of the interview data,
   however, indicated that all the syncope sufferers belonged to a
   cohesive and exclusive social network. Social psychological
   circumstances rather than individual psychopathology were noted to be
   primarily responsible for the spread and maintenance of the mass
   hysterical influence. Intervention consisted of health education,
   authoritative reassurance and back-up support. Follow-up assessment
   after three and 12 months indicated no further syncope episodes.

SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES

DT Article
ID MENTAL-RETARDATION; FAMILY CAREGIVERS; SUPPORT NETWORKS; SOCIAL
   SUPPORT; CHILDREN; PARENTS; BURDEN
AB This report describes a study of people with intellectual disability
   over the age of 40 years who were still living with relatives in the
   family home. Previous studies have revealed that there exist different
   types of social networks and that identifying network type and
   available informal support is important for planning effective service
   delivery. The main focus of this investigation was on the structure and
   characteristics of informal support networks and the pattern of support
   that occurred.
   The sample consisted of 32 individuals with an intellectual disability,
   mean age 46.7 years. Overall, the study found that carers received
   little support from other family members and the wider community in
   performing personal and household care tasks. The informal networks of
   older adults with learning disability operated on a hierarchical basis
   with primary family members, particularly parents and siblings,
   providing the bulk of informal support. Other relatives and friends and
   neighbours played a less significant role in informal care networks.
   The study also draws attention to the increasing number of elderly
   carers who, often single-handedly, provide the primary sources of care
   for older adults with learning disability. Contrary to what might be
   expected, it was found that the size of an individual's network, in
   terms of numbers of localised kin members, was not related to the
   amount of support the main carer received from others.

AB This study examines the social networks and deviant behavior of 92 male
   and female adolescent offenders in a secure training school.
   Semi-structured interviews were conducted individually with the youth
   and repeated following a four-week interval. Record data were reviewed
   to assess behavioral adjustment, The Social Cognitive Map analytic
   technique was utilized to identify social clusters. Findings indicate
   that these extremely delinquent youth formed reasonably stable social
   networks within the institution. Social clusters were distinguished
   most strongly on the basis of gender, race and proximity. Individuals
   within clusters had similar levels of behavioral adjustment and
   perceptions of intimacy with peers. The processes of peer group
   formation are similar to those found among public school counterparts.
   Treatment implications are discussed.

AB Peer relationships are considered to be a dominant feature of
   adolescence, but systematically formed social networks rarely have been
   studied. A social network analysis was used to describe adolescent
   friendship patterns and to compare them across schools and time. Ninth
   graders (n = 1030) at five high schools identified their friends at
   Wave I and again one year later. The resulting sets of friendship link;
   were subjected to social network analysis. The patterns of linkages
   identified adolescents as clique members, liaisons, and isolates.
   Clique membership,vas the modal social position pattern, but liaisons
   and isolates also were well represented. The proportions of adolescents
   representing each social position varied across schools. In all
   samples, cliques were homogeneous in gender, race, and mother's
   educational level, and cliques were largely stable over a one-year time
   period The possibility that social network characteristics could
   explain a variety of adolescent differences is discussed.

AB Despite the extensive research attention directed toward criminal peer
   groups, there has been little attention to the peer groups of sexual
   offenders. Sexual offenders are often considered to be loners who
   offend in isolation, but cases of sex crimes involving peer support are
   not difficult to find, e.g., child sex rings, gang rapes. To examine
   the role of peers in sexual offending, sexual offenders and nonsexual
   offenders were asked whether they knew other people who have committed
   sexual crimes. In comparison to the nonoffender community comparison
   group, the sexual offenders reported considerably more association and
   identification with sexual offenders. The associations also tended to
   be offence specific, such that child molesters knew other child

AB East Germany's unanticipated revolution in 1989 poses an interesting
   challenge to social movement research. The relatively spontaneous,
   peaceful revolution that toppled the communist regime cannot be fully
   explained by the prevailing theories of revolution and collective
   action. While both structurally oriented and identify-oriented theory
   offers insight into the revolutionary process, neither are completely
   satisfactory. Most theories assume a relatively open field of political
   contestation and conditions of relative social freedom that were absent
   in East Germany. I suggest a synthetic, historically specific approach
   in which collective identities are situated with small-scale social
   networks. The crucial factors in making the revolution possible were!
   shared grievances and the expectation of social solidarity. Though they
   were politically subordinated, ordinary East Germans expressed
   grievances and nurtured opposition in small circles of confidants.
   Reference to collective identities helped to mobilize and frame
   opposition in East Germany making a swift, unexpected revolution
   possible once the stab began to founder.

AB This paper examines the notion that informal interhousehold transfers
   of goods and services in tile communal economy are based upon
   reciprocity. Patterns of interhousehold transfer of goods and services
   are described, and the significance of kinship (or familial
   obligations) in shaping patterns of informal exchange are discussed.
   Data from a 1990 survey of household and residential organisation in
   Brisbane are used. Differences in income, labour force participation
   and the density and character of householders' social networks are
   considered as factors shaping contemporary interhousehold economic
   activity. Implications for our understanding of people's economic
   vulnerability are drawn from the observations.

AB This article summarizes the results of an empirical study of citizen
   protests against low-flying military jets. The protests occurred in the
   Federal Republic of Germany during the 1980s. The theoretical concept
   of mobilization-mediating social networks - called serial relays - was
   developed and its empirical implications tested in two regions. These
   localities were similar in terms of social and political context, and
   also in the extent to which they were subjected to military
   overflights, but they differed in terms of quantity and quality of
   protest mobilization. The study focuses empirically and analytically on
   the meso level of society, which was operationalized by gathering
   interview and survey data on the affiliations of activists and their
   acquaintances with various associations an the local level. By
   advancing to a structural analysis of contacts between networks rather
   than people, the study goes beyond the commonly applied egocentric
   perspective. The study concludes that high mobilization was facilitated
   by decentralized relays that linked protest-generating networks to more
   traditional parts of the local community.

AB This article presents three studies examining whether alexithymia is
   associated with less perceived and network social support, whether such
   relationships are accounted for by reduced social skills associated
   with alexithymia: and whether limited social support links alexithymia
   to health problems. The relationships between alexithymia (Toronto
   Alexithymia Scale), social variables, and physical health and
   depression were examined in both healthy young adults and patients.
   Alexithymia (especially deficits in identifying and communicating
   feelings) was related to less perceived support, fewer close
   relationships, and less social skill; the social skills deficit
   accounted fully for the association between alexithymia and a smaller
   social network. Additionally, alexithymia was related to both somatic
   complaints and depression, but social support generally was not. It is
   concluded that alexithymia is associated with reduced perceived and
   network social support, that these associations are likely due to
   alexithymia-related deficiencies in social skills, but that reduced
   social support does not account for the relationship between
   alexithymia and health problems. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

AB The social support networks and family structure of 62 low-income
   African American mothers were related to proximal and distal measures
   of the mother's parenting style and to the children's social and
   cognitive development. Women with larger support networks tended to be
   more responsive in interactions with their infants and to provide more
   stimulating home environments than mothers with smaller social
   networks. Activity level was the only infant outcome significantly
   related to social support. Family structure was not associated with
   either maternal or child outcomes in these analyses. These results
   support a systems model of parenting behavior and child development by
   indicating that maternal caregiving may be positively influenced by
   supportive social networks.

TI The Johnson Intervention and relapse during outpatient treatment
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE
LA English
DT Article
ID ABUSE
AB The Johnson Intervention is a therapeutic technique in which members of
   a person's social network confront him or her about the damage that
   drinking and drug use has caused and the action they will take if he or
   she does not enter treatment. Previously, we evaluated the
   effectiveness of the Johnson Intervention at engaging and retaining
   clients in outpatient alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment by
   comparing it to four other methods of referral. Although individuals
   who undergo a Johnson Intervention are most likely to enter treatment,
   the power of the Johnson Intervention to retain clients deteriorates
   over the course of treatment, as indicated by their diminished
   likelihood of completing. Given that abstinence from alcohol and other
   drugs is one of the first expectations placed on clients, we compared
   the Johnson Intervention to the other types of referral to evaluate the
   role of relapse during treatment. In a secondary analysis of 210 cases,
   we found relapse rates across the five types of referral ranged From
   38% to 79%. Those in the Johnson Intervention group were more likely to
   relapse than three of the four other groups and, across all groups,
   those who relapsed were less likely to complete treatment. In spite of
   its high relapse rate, the Johnson Intervention is very effective in
   retaining those who relapse because it is very effective retaining all
   clients, whether they relapse or not.

   SOCIAL-CLASS; FOLLOW-UP; MEN; INSULIN; STRESS; HYPERTENSION; RESISTANCE
AB In epidemiological studies from different countries, morbidity and
   mortality have been found to be increased in populations exposed to
   adverse psychosocial factors, e.g. low social class or poor social
   networks. Biological mechanisms must be operative to mediate this
   influence of social factors on clinical outcome. As increasing age is
   the common denominator for different categories of chronic disease, the
   ageing process itself in individuals may be studied in connection with
   data on exposure to negative psychosocial and lifestyle factors. A
   hypothesis is stated that premature ageing is the result of social
   pathology working on human physiology if buffering, health-preserving
   (salutogenic) mechanisms are not sufficient to counteract this effect.
   One measurable variable of the ageing process may be melatonin, known
   to decrease with age and to be lower in patients with coronary heart
   disease than in normal individuals.

DT Article
ID FRIENDSHIPS
AB Literature suggests that women's skills in establishing close ties with
   other women help sustain them in old age by giving them a sense of
   control over their lives. This paper questions how such a notion may
   apply to women in a nursing home setting and contrasts women's
   experiences with those of men. It is a reanalysis of data from a
   previously reported study of institutionalized elders' social networks,
   this time with a specific focus on women residents' relationships with
   one another. Here, I consider the role of negative interaction in
   personal relationships, the meaning of intimacy and reciprocity in the
   nursing home context, and issues of age and gender. The final section,
   implications for practice and future research, includes a discussion of
   the opportunities for and constraints on relationship formation.

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; INNER-CITY
AB This essay tests key components of the mismatch hypothesis with a
   sample of inner-city men that includes four ethnic or racial groupings
   - whites, Blacks, Puerto Ricans, and Mexican immigrants, The findings
   provide limited support to mismatch. Key components of mismatch. such
   as human capital attributes and access to automobile commuting, do
   appear to influence employment likelihoods among native disadvantaged
   minorities, but have little effect on immigrants, The latter
   consistently exhibit high employment rates. The interpretation offered
   rests on two factors. First the data support the idea that immigrants'
   social networks largely underlie their impressive work records. In
   addition, the data provide limited support to the explanation, strongly
   indicated in the literature, that immigrants are favored by employers
   for their exploitability and that such preferences are expressed via
   hiring techniques that utilize the immigrants' social networks.

DE child mortality; maternal deprivation; orphanhood; step-parents
AB The study aims at elucidating the fate of orphans in 19th century
   Sweden. A cohort of all children born in the region of Sundsvall was
   followed. The Cox regression model was used. The population increased
   12-fold in the sawmill parish, and doubled in the other parishes. Every
   13th child lost either his or her mother or father. The death risk
   represented by being a motherless infant exceeded every other death
   risk for the child, and was further enhanced if parents were crofters
   or coming from the sawmill parish. For children beyond the age of I
   year, factors other than parental deprivation became decisive.
   Stepparents had an immense positive influence on the survival of the
   children. The social network worked relatively well for those children
   who were orphans beyond the age of 1 year. The motherless infants had
   the worst outcome. The best chance for survival was found for children
   with step-parents.

AB This is a study of acculturation and acculturation stress among Cuban
   and Nicaraguan adolescent males and their parents, The sample consisted
   of 674 Cuban-American and 211 Nicaraguan-American 6th and 7th grade
   adolescents and one of their parents. Hypotheses predicting group
   differences in acculturation stress were tested. Analyses were
   bivariate and multivariate, using parent and adolescent data. Findings
   indicated important differences in acculturation stress for different
   cohorts of immigrants within the two ethnic groups as well as
   differences between the subsamples. Important differences were also
   found between adolescent and parental acculturation stress, with more
   recent immigrants among the adolescents experiencing more language
   conflicts, while parents reported more long-term language conflicts.
   Adolescent and parental acculturation-related stressors and
   acculturation levels were strongly associated with lower levels of
   family cohesion, increased parent/child acculturation conflicts,
   adolescent self-esteem and adolescent perceived teacher derogation. The
   differences and similarities found between the Cuban and Nicaraguan
   groups, parents and adolescents, are discussed with a focus on the
   importance of the family as a coping source for the stresses associated
   with immigrant adaptation.

SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH

   POPULATION; TRENDS; PREDICTORS; VALIDITY
AB Study objectives - To analyse the factors that determined whether or
   not people were successful in quitting tobacco during the 1980s in
   Sweden.
   Design - A logistic regression model was used for the analyses and
   included: education, marital status, socioeconomic group, social
   network, physical activities, cigarette consumption, and years spent
   smoking as independent variables. Men and women were analysed
   separately for smoking. A specific univariate analysis was also
   performed for men who used snuff.
   Setting - Sweden.
   Participants - A panel of 5104 randomised people aged 16-84 years was
   interviewed in 1980-81 and followed up in 1988-89 in the survey of
   living conditions undertaken by Statistics Sweden. The participation
   rate was 86%. The panel included 1546 men and women who were daily
   smokers. There were 418 daily users of snuff among the men, and 129 men
   both smoked and used snuff.
   Main results - Together 26% of women and 23% of men had quit smoking.
   Five per cent in both groups were new smokers. Among men, 26% had quit
   using snuff and 5% had begun smoking. New snuff users among men were
   5%. In the multivariate analysis, unmarried men kept smoking at
   significantly higher rates (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2,3.6), as did those men
   who smoked 11-20 cigarettes/day (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.5, 3.4), or more than
   20 cigarettes/day (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.4,5.7). Among women, smoking 11-20
   cigarettes/day was also a significant factor (OR 3.3; 95% CI 2.1,5.0).
   Men and women aged 25-44 were significantly more Likely to continue
   smoking (OR = 2.1; 95% CI 1.1,3.7, and 2.2; 95% CI 1.2,4.4) as were
   those who had smoked for 20 years or more (OR 4.7; 95% CI 2.0,10.8 and
   OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.1,5.5, respectively). For women, low education (up to
   grade 9) was also a significant factor (OR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.2,5.1).
   Among men who had quit using snuff we did not find any values of
   significance.
   Conclusions - One in four smokers had quit during the 1980s and a few
   started smoking (5%). Some men quit smoking and started using snuff
   instead. For both sexes, the daily consumption of cigarettes, years
   spent smoking, and age were the most important determinants of
   successful quitting. In men, being married/cohabiting was an important
   factor as was higher education in women.

TI Migration with endogenous moving costs
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID THRESHOLD MODELS; SOCIAL NETWORKS; UNITED-STATES; BEHAVIOR; FAMINE
AB We study a dynamic model of labor migration in which moving costs
   decrease with the number of migrants already settled in the
   destination. This assumption is supported by sociological studies of
   migrant networks. With endogenous moving costs migration occurs
   gradually over time. Once it starts, it develops momentum, and
   migratory flows may increase even as wage differentials narrow, In
   addition, migration tends to follow geographical channels, and
   low-moving-cost individuals migrate first. These patterns are
   consistent with historical evidence from the Great Black Migration of
   1915-1960, much of which cannot be reconciled with existing migration
   models.

AB A representative sample of 227 first-contact schizophrenia patients
   (DSM III) were followed up for 5 years. The psychiatric teams
   responsible for the treatment of the patients conducted detailed,
   standardized interviews with the patients at entry and at the end of
   the 1st, 2nd, and 5th year. Changes in patients' social network were
   analysed in accordance with their family situation. Men more often
   lived with their parents and less often with a spouse than women;
   additionally, men had a tendency to move from living with a spouse to
   living with parents or outside family, while women showed the opposite
   tendency. Recovery of social networks was most prominent among patients
   who were living with their spouse. Instead, patients living outside
   families often lost their social contacts during follow-up. For
   patients living with their parents changes in social network were
   mainly explained by a selective migration of patients back to living
   with their parents. Family environment can be of great importance to
   schizophrenia patients in their social recovery from psychosis. At the
   same time, however, the families of schizophrenia patients need support
   from the psychiatric treatment system. Patients living outside families
   - and men in particular - are at great risk of losing their social
   contacts and therefore need network therapy.

AB The influence of type of illness (breast cancer versus osteoarthritis)
   and age on physical health and functioning, self-system interpretive
   mechanisms, and women's psychological well-being were examined.
   Self-system interpretive mechanisms are considered mediators of the
   effects of physical health on psychological well-being and include
   social comparisons, social integration, and illness perceptions.
   Young-old (aged 60-74) and old-old (75+) women, diagnosed with
   osteoarthritis (N = 102) or breast cancer (N = 86), who volunteered for
   the study were interviewed using structured self-report scales.
   Young-old and old-old women did not differ in terms of health status,
   interpretive mechanisms, or on three of five indices of psychological
   well-being. On the other hand, women with arthritis, regardless of age,
   reported more functional health problems, more symptoms, and perceived
   their illness as more severe, more chronic, and less controllable than
   women with breast cancer. Although women with arthritis and breast
   cancer differed significantly in terms of physical health, they did not
   differ on multiple measures of psychological well-being. For both
   groups, women who made more positive social comparisons and who had
   more extensive social networks had higher levels of psychological
   well-being, regardless of physical health problems. (C) 1996 John Wiley

TI Increased rate of conduct problems in urban areas: What is the

   BEHAVIOR
AB Objective: To compare the prevalence of conduct problems (CP) according
   to level of urbanization and to determine which factors account for the
   potential difference in prevalence rates. Method: Study 1 used a
   questionnaire survey of a nationally representative sample of 10,462
   Norwegian adolescents. Study 2 used a questionnaire survey of a
   representative sample of 1,346 adolescents living in Oslo.
   Self-reported CP included most DSM-III-R criteria for conduct disorder.
   Results: CP rates were similar in all levels of urbanization, except
   for the only semimetropolitan city in the country, the capital Oslo,
   which had CP rates twice those of the rest of the country. This
   increase rate could not be explained by a series of commonly advocated
   explanations: family structure and parental practices, social network,
   socioeconomic status, integration in community activities, religious
   involvement, and race. However, involvement in ''soft'' drugs and
   associating with antisocial peers could explain the statistically
   differential rates. Furthermore, in the Oslo study, adolescents' CP did
   not vary according to density of population or region within the city.
   Conclusions: The results support previous studies showing increased
   rates of CP in urban areas. However, urbanization must pass a certain
   threshold before it has this effect. Moreover, the lack of support for
   commonly advocated explanations for the difference between urban and
   nonurban areas suggests that investigations specifically addressing
   potential explanations for this difference should be conducted. The
   results indicate that the increased rates of substance use in highly
   urbanized areas may account for the difference in CP rates by
   prolonging and aggravating CP.

AB East Germany's unanticipated revolution in 1989 poses an interesting
   challenge to social movement research. The relatively spontaneous,
   peaceful revolution that toppled the communist regime cannot be fully
   explained by the prevailing theories of revolution and collective
   action. While both structurally oriented and identify-oriented theory
   offers insight into the revolutionary process, neither are completely
   satisfactory. Most theories assume a relatively open field of political
   contestation and conditions of relative social freedom that were absent
   in East Germany. I suggest a synthetic, historically specific approach
   in which collective identities are situated with small-scale social
   networks. The crucial factors in making the revolution possible were!
   shared grievances and the expectation of social solidarity. Though they
   were politically subordinated, ordinary East Germans expressed
   grievances and nurtured opposition in small circles of confidants.
   Reference to collective identities helped to mobilize and frame
   opposition in East Germany making a swift, unexpected revolution
   possible once the stab began to founder.

AB The ecological framework for the study of child abuse is briefly
   described and the present study-of two adjoining economically depressed
   localities with contrasting rates of child abuse-is theoretically
   located within the framework. The study focuses on the neighbourhood as
   a potential source of support for families, the study design
   emphasizing the character of the neighbourhoods as social entities. The
   social character and reported child abuse histories of the two study
   neighbourhoods in Western Sydney, Australia, are presented, and the
   research instruments and procedures used in a household survey, are
   described. Demographic data, parents'/carers' ratings of (i) the social
   environment, (ii) the locality as a place to raise children, (iii)
   transport and communication patterns, together with membership of nine
   sub-networks of each carer's support network, are analysed. The one
   outstanding difference between the two localities was found to be the
   structure of the networks of the two samples of residents. In the area
   with a higher rate of abuse there was a relative lack of connection
   between more immediate (familial) and more distant parts of the social
   networks, a finding which parallels the results of several earlier
   studies of clinical and non-clinical populations.

AB Study objective - Previous studies have established a relationship
   between low levels of social networks and total mortality, but few have
   examined cause specific mortality or disease incidence. This study
   aimed to examine prospectively the relationships between social
   networks and total and cause specific mortality, as well as
   cardiovascular disease incidence.
   Design - This was a four year follow up study in an ongoing cohort of
   men, for whom information on social networks was collected at baseline.
   The main outcome measures were total mortality, further categorised
   into deaths from cardiovascular disease (stroke and coronary heart
   disease), total cancer, accidents/suicides, and all other causes; as
   well as stroke and coronary heart disease incidence.
   Participants - Altogether 32 624 US male health professionals aged 42
   to 77 years in 1988, who were free of coronary heart disease, stroke,
   and cancer at baseline.
   Results - A total of 511 deaths occurred during 122 911 person years of
   follow up. Compared with men with the highest level of social networks,
   socially isolated men (not married, fewer than six friends or
   relatives, no membership in church or community groups) were at
   increased risk for cardiovascular disease mortality (age adjusted
   relative risk, 1.90; 95% CI 1.07, 3.37) and deaths from accidents and
   suicides (age adjusted relative risk 2.22; 95% CI 0.76, 6.47). No
   excess risks were found for other causes of death. Socially isolated
   men were also at increased risk of stroke incidence (relative risk,
   2.21; 95% CI, 1.12, 4.35), but not incidence of non-fatal myocardial
   infarction.
   Conclusions - Social networks were associated with lower total
   mortality by reducing deaths from cardiovascular disease and
   accidents/suicides. Strong social networks were associated with reduced
   incidence of stroke, though not of coronary heart disease. However,
   social networks may assist in prolonging the survival of men with
   established coronary heart disease.

AB Background and Purpose This prospective study examined the prevalence
   and longitudinal course of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) after
   stroke and its comorbidity with major depression over time. The
   contributions of lesion characteristics, functional impairment, and
   psychosocial factors to the development of CAD after stroke were
   studied.
   Methods In a population-based cohort of 80 patients with acute stroke,
   we assessed GAD and comorbid major depression, functional ability, and
   social network at regular time points over 3 years. Cerebral atrophy
   and brain lesion parameters were determined from CT scans performed at
   the acute stage and after 3 years.
   Results The prevalence of GAD after stroke was 28% in the acute stage,
   and there was no significant decrease through the 3 years of follow-up.
   At 1 year, only 23% of the patients with early GAD (0 to 3 months) had
   recovered; those not recovered at this follow-up had a high risk of a
   chronic development of the anxiety disorder. Comorbidity with major
   depression was high and seemed to impair the prognosis of depression.
   At the acute stage after stroke, GAD plus depression was associated
   with left hemispheric lesion, whereas anxiety alone was associated with
   right hemispheric lesion. Cerebral atrophy was associated with both
   depression and anxiety disorder late but not early after stroke,
   Dependence in activities of daily living and reduced social network
   were associated with GAD at all follow-up periods except at the acute
   stage.
   Conclusions GAD after stroke is a common and longlasting affliction
   that interferes substantially with social life and functional recovery.
   There is a differentiation of factors implicated in its development
   based on the period of time since the stroke event.

AB The mathematical definition of clique has never been entirely

   ethnographic descriptions. Two examples, using 'classical' social

AB The Graphic Social Network Measure (GSNM) adds a new dimension to
   measuring egocentric networks by utilizing a computer to transform a
   person's subjective impressions of his or her regular relationships
   into a graphic display of the structure. A twenty-three question
   multidimensional instrument measures three social network dimensions:
   relationship depth, conflict, and perceived contact. Convergent
   validity, divergent validity, and reliability of the GSNM was
   evaluated. The sample of 129 adults included fifty-six individuals from
   a psychiatric clinic, fifty college housing employees, and twenty-three
   graduate students. Results supported the validity and reliability of
   the GSNM for further use in research, assessment, and network
   intervention planning.

AB Objective: The study compared the quality of life of long-stay
   psychiatric patients after they had been discharged to community
   residences for one year with that of long-stay patients who remained
   hospitalized. Methods: Long-stay patients (that is, those with stays of
   at least one year) who were discharged from two psychiatric hospitals
   in London were closely matched with patients likely to stay in the
   hospital for another year Baseline (in-hospital) and one-year follow-up
   assessments were conducted using six instruments to measure factors
   related to quality of life such as problems in social functioning and
   size of the social network. Results: A total of 494 discharged patients
   were compared with 279 patients who remained in the hospital. The death
   rate did not differ between the two groups. Only six discharged
   patients became vagrants, and only two were imprisoned, one briefly
   discharged patients were living under much less restrictive conditions,
   they preferred their life in the community, and the number of their
   friends increased, as did the number of acquaintances in the community
   such as neighbors. No adverse effects of discharge on mental state or
   social behavior were noted. Conclusions: The results indicate that
   community care is a beneficial alternative to longterm care in
   psychiatric hospitals for the majority of patients, provided it is well
   planned and adequate resources are available.

SO DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE

DE alcohol; social network; students
ID BEHAVIOR
AB In Israel, there is a lack of research regarding the association
   between background characteristics of university students and their use
   of alcohol. In response, a cohort of 1276 male and female undergraduate
   students was surveyed at a major university in the country. Among the
   study participants, 21% (270) reported regular, weekly use of alcohol.
   Men were much more inclined to drink on a weekly basis than women; and,
   7% of the students who used alcohol regularly did so on a daily basis.
   Approximately 70% of the students who used alcohol drank in the company
   of friends; and, one-third of the alcohol using students reported that
   it was important to have their friends with them when they used the
   substance. Student background characteristics found to be associated
   with weekly alcohol use included: gender, age, country of origin,
   economic status, academic discipline, father's level of education, and
   parents' use of alcohol and legal medication. An important finding of
   this study was that 30% of the students who used alcohol reported
   driving a car after drinking and 3% of this sub-population drank while
   driving. Alcohol tends to be used and abused more than any other licit
   or illicit substance among Israeli university students. This issue,
   however, receives far less attention than illicit drug use in terms of
   education, public awareness, prevention and treatment activities.
   Alcohol use and abuse among university students in Israel is far from
   the major problem found elsewhere. Nevertheless, planned prevention and
   other forms of intervention are needed on campuses throughout the
   country.

AB An investigation was performed on material from deceased from the
   Copenhagen County, examined at the Institute of Forensic Medicine
   during the period 1985-1989.
   The basis and the reliability of the diagnosis of chronic alcoholism in
   a forensic post-mortem material is discussed. The frequency of
   alcoholics in the autopsy material varied between 25 per cent and 30
   per cent annually.
   The frequency of women was significantly lower than that of men. The
   alcoholics were generally younger than controls, they were more often
   divorced, but cohabited with the same frequency as controls. Both the
   alcoholics and the controls belonged mainly to the lowest social
   classes.
   Alcoholics lived in flats and died in the living room more often than
   controls.
   Special attention is given to persons dying in bathtubs and on
   staircases.
   The interval between last seen alive' and 'found dead' was
   significantly longer in alcoholics, signifying loss of social network.
   Both alcoholics and controls generally lived under poor social
   conditions, more pronounced in the former.

AB Two patient education methods, Information Media (IM) and Social
   Network (SN), were compared to determine their relative effectiveness
   on recruitment and subsequent compliance behavior of people infected
   with onchocerciasis in respect of appointment keeping and ivermectin
   consumption in existing primary health care facilities in six
   communities in southwestern Nigeria, Two communities each were randomly
   assigned to the IM intervention group, two to the SN group, and two
   served as controls. A total of 1265 persons out of an estimated target
   population of 5033 infected individuals were enrolled in the study.
   Coverage rates were higher in the intervention communities (30.3% for
   SN and 29.9% for IM) than control (7.3%) but the differences between
   intervention groups was not significant. A drop-off was seen in
   attendance at the second round of ivermectin distribution. Nearly equal
   proportions of the intervention groups returned (43.3% for SN and 47.4%
   for IM), while few control patients came back for their second dose
   (12.3%). Factors responsible for the low turnout were thought to
   include the content of educational messages, mobility of community
   members and limited time available to collect the drugs. Cost
   considerations led to recommendations to maintain facility based
   distribution and the SN approach, with greater emphasis on mobilization
   to increase coverage and compliance.

ID MODELS
AB Interventions aimed at changing the psychological attributes of
   individuals who form a social system may be limited by reliance on
   models and methods which do not account for the effects of social
   interaction on individual attributes. The use of network analysis to
   model the effects of social contagion on personal attributes is
   demonstrated in an evaluation of an organizational intervention.
   Sociometric indices of the norms created by social contagion predicted
   subjects' self-perceptions better than either expectations imposed on
   them in small groups or their own observable behavior. Social contagion
   stabilized the subjects' self-perceptions over time, despite the
   efforts of the intervention to change their self-perceptions through
   small group socialization and organizational restructuring. Network
   models of social contagion may provide useful tools for the design and
   evaluation of interventions that aim to change the attributes of
   individuals who form social systems. Further, these models
   theoretically integrate social relations and social cognition in a
   manner that helps to bridge the sociological and psychological study of
   human relations.

ID STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; DIRECTED-GRAPHS
AB Spanning nearly sixty years of research, statistical network analysis
   has passed through (at least) two generations of researchers and
   models. Beginning in the late 1930's, the first generation of research
   dealt with the distribution of various network statistics, under a
   variety of null models. The second generation, beginning in the 1970's
   and continuing into the 1980's, concerned models, usually for
   probabilities of relational ties among very small subsets of actors, in
   which various simple substantive tendencies were parameterized. Much of
   this research, most of which utilized log linear models, first appeared
   in applied statistics publications.
   But recent developments in social network analysis promise to bring us
   into a third generation. The Markov random graphs of Frank and Strauss
   (1986) and especially the estimation strategy for these models
   developed by Strauss and Ikeda (1990; described in brief in Strauss,
   1992), are very recent and promising contributions to this field. Here
   we describe a large class of models that can be used to investigate
   structure in social networks. These models include several
   generalizations of stochastic blockmodels, as well as models
   parameterizing global tendencies towards clustering and centralization,
   and individual differences in such tendencies. Approximate model fits
   are obtained using Strauss and Ikeda's (1990) estimation strategy.
   In this paper we describe and extend these models and demonstrate how
   they can be used to address a variety of substantive questions about
   structure in social networks.

TI Developing community networks to deliver HIV prevention interventions
SO PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID OUTREACH; PROJECT
AB OUTREACH HAS A LONG HISTORY IN HEALTH and social service programs as an
   important method for reaching at-risk persons within their communities.
   One method of ''outreach'' is based on the recruitment of networks of
   community members (or ''networkers'') to deliver HIV prevention
   messages and materials in the context of their social networks and
   everyday lives. This paper documents the experiences of the AIDS
   Community Demonstration Projects in recruiting networkers to deliver
   HIV prevention interventions to high-risk populations, including
   injecting drug users not in treatment; female sex partners of injecting
   drug users; female sex traders; men who have sex with men but do not
   self-identify as gay; and youth in high-risk situations.
   The authors interviewed project staff and reviewed project records of
   the implementation of community networks in five cities. Across cities,
   the projects successfully recruited persons into one or more community
   networks to distribute small media materials, condoms, and bleach kits,
   and encourage risk-reduction behaviors among community members.
   Networkers' continuing participation was enlisted through a variety of
   monetary and nonmonetary incentives. While continuous recruitment of
   networkers was necessary due to attrition, most interventions reported
   maintaining a core group of networkers. In addition, the projects
   appeared to serve as a starting point for some networkers to become
   more active in other community events and issues.

TI Black identity and drinking in the US: A national study
SO ADDICTION
LA English
DT Article
ID GROUP IDENTIFICATION; HISPANICS; AMERICANS; BEHAVIOR; ADULTS
AB The relationship between ethnic identity and drinking patterns was
   explored in 1947 black adults from a nation-wide study of drinking
   behavior. Factor analysis revealed that a multi-dimensional construct
   which included four factors-media preferences, socio-political
   awareness, endogamy and social networks-was necessary to operationalize
   and measure the concept of ethnic identity. Using structural equation
   modeling, a model was tested which analyzed the impact of ethnic
   identification on religiosity and drinking norms, which in turn were
   predictors of drinking and heavier drinking latent variables. The
   results showed that ethnic identity influenced drinking behavior
   indirectly through its effects on drinking norms and religiosity as
   well as directly. Most aspects of ethnic identity decreased drinking
   levels. Respondents who scored higher on involvement with black social
   networks and black social and political awareness drank at lower levels
   than other respondents. These results were attributed to the prevalence
   of norms for abstinence and high levels of social control regarding
   drinking in black communities. However, high scores on using black
   media increased drinking rates. It was suggested that the promotion of
   alcohol use in black orientated media as well as the social settings
   attended by those who prefer black media might increase alcohol
   consumption.

SO OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE

ID PREVALENCE; SYMPTOMS; DISEASE; WORK
AB Objectives-To analyse the association between symptoms from the
   musculoskeletal system and many psychosocial and other physical
   stressors in the job demand-control-support model. Also to analyse the
   influence of personality characteristics.
   Methods-1306 salespeople answered a self administered questionnaire on
   job characteristics, exposures, personality characteristics, social
   network, smoking and drinking habits, and symptoms of the neck,
   shoulders, and low back.
   Results-In multivariate analyses, high job demands were related to neck
   and shoulder symptoms (ORs 1.43-1.47 in the highest exposure groups
   compared with the lowest), and tendency to become overworked and lack
   of social support from colleagues were related to back pain (OR
   1.81-2.04 in the highest exposure groups compared with the lowest).
   Lack of variation in the job, low control over time, and high
   competition were related to neck symptoms, but there was an interaction
   so that both low control over time and high competition had to be
   present to increase the OR. Also, driving long distances and sedentary
   work were related to neck and low back pain, and time spent in the car
   to shoulder pain (ORs 1.64-2.80 in the three highest groups upsilon the
   lowest exposure groups).
   Conclusion-Both psychosocial and physical factors were associated with
   musculoskeletal symptoms. Many dimensions of the demand-control-support
   model were associated with symptoms. Only one personality
   characteristic, tendency to feel overworked, significantly influenced
   the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms.

AB This article describes the development and validation of the Well-being
   Enquiry for Diabetics (WED), a new self-reported measure of
   diabetes-related quality of life, The questionnaire provides a
   differential evaluation of four areas of quality of life:
   diabetes-related somatic symptoms and physical functioning
   (''Symptoms'', 10 items); diabetes-related worries and emotional status
   (''Discomfort'', 10 items); mental health (''Serenity'', 10 items);
   familial relationships, role functioning and social network
   (''Impact'', 20 items), The questionnaire was validated in a sample of
   267 patients, 70 of which with Type I and 197 with Type II diabetes,
   Internal consistency and Test-Retest stability were satisfactory, The
   questionnaire showed the expected correlations with other psychometric
   measures (DQOL for quality of life, STAI for anxiety, Ham-D for
   depression and BITE for eating behavior), WED total and subscale scores
   were affected, as expected, by diabetes therapy, chronic complications,
   and concurrent mental disorders, The ''Serenity'' subscale appeared to
   be a simple, sensitive and specific method for the detection of
   concurrent mental disorders, The WED questionnaire is a simple,
   reliable and sensitive measure of diabetes-related quality of life, to
   be used with both Type I and Type II diabetic patients, regardless of
   age, sex, occupation and educational level, in different clinical
   settings, The subscale ''Serenity'', which provides a simple measure of
   mental health, can be used to discriminate impairments of quality of
   life determined by concurrent mental disorders.

AB St. Barthelemy, a small island in the northeastern Caribbean, is
   populated primarily by descendants of 17th century French settlers, and
   hosts seven language varieties. To explain the linguistic complexity of
   the island, this article reconstructs both its social history (using
   censuses, church records, and land registries) and its economic
   history, analyzing the effects of economic change on the island's
   population. The two offshoot communities on St. Thomas provide evidence
   of social fragmentation related to occupational differences. Functional
   explanations for St. Earth's linguistic diversity are inadequate;
   however, the social network theory of Milroy & Milroy 1992 proves
   useful in explaining the persistence of language differences in this
   small isolated community.

   physician-assisted suicide
SO PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
DE euthanasia; physician assisted suicide; social network; the Netherlands
ID DUTCH NURSING-HOMES; FAMILY DOCTORS; NETHERLANDS
AB Objective: To obtain insight into the involvement of a patient's social
   network in the process leading to the administration of euthanasia and
   assisted suicide (EAS).
   Design: Descriptive, retrospective.
   Method: Data were collected by means of anonymous questionnaires sent
   to a random sample of 521 general practitioners (GPs) in the Province
   of North Holland and 521 GPs from the rest of the Netherlands and all
   713 Dutch nursing home physicians (NHPs). The data were collected over
   the period 1986 to June 1990 inclusive.
   Results: GPs and NHPs had discussions most often with the partner of
   the patient about the patient's request for EAS, the doctor's intention
   to administer EAS and the actual administering of EAS. According to
   both the GPs and the NHPs the social network practically always agreed
   with the doctor's decision to administer EAS. The persons who were most
   often present at the patient's bedside when EAS was administered were
   the patient's partner and children (29%). Often, especially in the
   cases of GPs, the decision not to report EAS was determined by the
   desire of relatives and/or the physician not to involve the relatives
   in a judicial inquiry.
   Conclusion: To a large extent the social network was involved in the
   patient's request for EAS, the doctor's intention to administer EAS and
   the actual administering of EAS. This seems to be important both for
   good decision-making with regard to EAS and for helping relatives to
   come to terms with the loss of a dear one.

TI Applying standard network analysis to hypermedia systems: Implications
   for learning
SO JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID METHODOLOGY; HYPERTEXT
AB Hypermedia systems may be considered as networks of interconnected
   fragments of information. In the literature, several attempts have been
   made to describe characteristics of nodes, links, and of the overall
   structure of such systems. However, the utility of these attempts is
   only limited for educational purposes because most of them are
   uneconomic in measuring and almost none of them is explicitly concerned
   with learning. In this article, an analogy between information networks
   and social networks is established. This analogy is used to illustrate
   the application of standard network analysis procedures. These
   procedures are available in widespread PC software (e.g., UCINET) and
   are used for calculating indices mapping structural aspects of
   hypermedia systems which are hypothesized to be relevant for learning.
   It is shown how the graphical representation of a hypothetical
   hypermedia system can be transformed into a matrix format which
   functions as the basis for computing standard network indices for
   nodes, groups of nodes, and entire networks (e.g., among others,
   centrality, cliques, or path distances). For each index, its potential
   influence on learning processes or learning outcomes is discussed.
   Implications of using standard network indices for research and
   practice in the field of educational or instructional hypermedia
   systems are outlined.

AB The major role of mathematical models of transmission dynamics and
   population biology of sexually transmitted diseases is helping
   understand the influence of the many biologic, social, and behavioral
   factors that influence the incidence or prevalence of infection.
   Various models can examine heterogeneity in sexual behavior and
   determine how individual variation influences epidemiologic pattern
   within a population. In the cases of heterogeneity in sex acts and in
   sex partner numbers, heterogeneity acts to enhance the likelihood of
   the persistence of infection. Also important is the pattern of mixing
   or sexual contact within a community. Assortative mixing promotes rapid
   spread in high-sexual-activity classes but results in a lower endemic
   equilibrium state compared with random mixing. In these models, each
   facet of behavior is treated separately. The obvious next goal of
   modeling is to meld processes together into a single mathematical
   framework; however, quantitative epidemiologic information on each
   factor is still needed.

AB This article explores the relationship between level of social
   integration and various aspects of health. A search of the literature
   published since the mid-1970s (under the MEDLINE key words, ''social
   ties,'' ''social network,'' ''social isolation,'' ''social
   environment'') presented strong evidence that social integration lends
   to reduced mortality risks, and to a better state of mental health. The
   evidence on physical health outcomes is less conclusive. There is no
   consistent evidence that social integration affects the incidence of
   disease (at lease for cardiovascular outcomes). However, social
   integration does appear to have a highly beneficial effect on
   post-myocardial infarction prognosis (functioning and longevity). A
   physiologic basis for these effects on health outcomes is also
   indicated by research demonstrating that both social isolation and
   nonsupportive social interactions can result in lower immune Junction
   and higher neuroendocrine and cardiovascular activity while socially
   supportive interactions have the opposite effects. In conclusion,
   available data suggest that, although social integration is generally
   associated with better health outcomes, the quality of existing ties
   also appears to influence the extent of such health benefits. Clearly,
   individuals' networks of social relationships represent dynamic and
   complex social systems that affect health outcomes. (C) 1996 by

AB The study explored reasons why some bereaved parents participate in a
   self-help/support group while others do not. Data about forty-three
   support group participants and forty-two nonparticipants and their
   deceased children were obtained through questionnaires and telephone
   interviews. Over 76 percent of nonparticipants were found to have lost
   their child after a period of anticipatory grief while 80 percent of
   participants lost their child suddenly or without adequate forewarning.
   Having adequate support in their immediate environment was the reason
   stated by most for not joining a group. The majority of group
   participants mentioned that they needed a place to share grief with
   other bereaved parents even though their family and friends were
   supportive. It appears that bereaved parents are more likely to join a
   support group when they experience a particularly traumatic loss and do
   not find others who have suffered a similar loss in their usual social
   network.

AB Community psychiatric understanding points to complex-interactive
   contributions from a variety of community sectors concerning people's
   mental health. In the light of an ongoing fishery crisis in Lofoten, a
   mental health promotion project ''Liv Laga i Lofoten'' was planned. The
   theoretical basis of the ''Liv Laga'' model for mental health promotion
   is the interaction of recent strain situations, support from social
   networks, and personal resources; within a local community framework.
   The level of social integration-disintegration of the local community
   is dealt with both theoretically and in practice. The design of ''Liv
   Laga i Lofoten'' was developed through a process bringing the
   psychiatric out-patient clinic, the municipal health and social
   services, and local politicians together to secure local ownership and
   identification with the project. A main feature of the project work is
   the combination of close engagement, participation in planning and
   practical work, and the use of a scientific model as a continuous basis
   for understanding and implementation. External resources must be baked
   into local social networks, and programmes must emerge from locally
   felt needs. Structures of leadership and cooperation must always be an
   integral part of a community mental health project.

   understanding of female depression. This study was designed to test
   whether recall of parental rearing (Parental Bonding Instrument),

   Social Support (Mannheim interview of Social Support) differs
   significantly between two groups of women: one with non bipolar
   affective disorder (DSM III R) compared with another (control) of
   healthy women from a primary practice setting. A relationship with low
   mother-child affection, a dyadic relationship mainly characterized by
   poor cohesion and low everyday psychological support from the social
   network were the risk factors that best differentiated depressed women
   from those in the control group.

AB We assessed the frequency of short-term, post-traumatic symptoms among
   evacuees of the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake. A total of 67 younger
   subjects (under 60 years) and 75 elderly subjects (60 years or above)
   were interviewed during the third week after the earthquake, and 50 and
   73 subjects, respectively, were interviewed during the eighth week. All
   subjects were assessed using the Post-Traumatic Symptom Scale. During
   the first assessment, subjects from both age groups experienced sleep
   disturbances, depression, hypersensitivity and irritability. During the
   second assessment, the percentage of younger subjects experiencing
   symptoms did not decrease, while elderly subjects showed a significant
   decrease in 8 of 10 symptoms. This may have been due to such factors as
   decreased psychological stress, extensive social networks, and previous
   disaster experiences in the case of the elderly subjects.

DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; WOMEN
AB We discovered from a sample of 340 homeless families that services
   designed to aid them emerged from two, often conflicting, scrambles for
   resources. Social service providers parlayed public sentiment toward
   homelessness into service-intensive programs. The homeless took
   advantage of such programs, not necessarily for the services, but as a
   way to more quickly get subsidized housing. The result was an
   unintentional conflict of interest and failed policy. The homeless
   remained in the program longer than assumed because of a shortage of
   subsidized housing and because the regimented services ultimately
   undermined what fragile social networks they had previously devised to
   survive.

AB In this paper, we examine social and psychological characteristics of
   60 HIV+ women and gay men, matched on age and stage of HIV infection. A
   discriminant function analysis was performed using measures of life
   adversity, psychological distress, an psychosocial resources. The best
   combination of predictors for distinguishing between HIV+ women and gay
   men was comprised of satisfaction with emotional support, network size,
   use of avoidant coping, Hamilton depression, and loneliness scores
   [Chi(2)(7)=14.8, p<.05]. Women reported more satisfaction with
   emotional support, although gay men had larger social networks. Gay men
   used more avoidant coping and had higher loneliness scores as compared
   to women, although women reported more depressive symptoms. Utilizing
   this set of psychosocial variables, we correctly classified 73% of the
   HIV+ women and 67% of the HIV+ men. These findings suggest the
   importance of considering subgroup differences in the design of
   counseling programs for HIV+ individuals.

TI Local purchasing schemes and rural development: An evaluation of local
   exchange and trading systems (LETS)
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID REGIONAL GROWTH; UNITED-STATES
AB Through a critical review of economic base theory, this paper argues
   that the ability to prevent income leaking out of an area is as
   important to rural development as the capacity to generate external
   income. The problem at present, however, is that few effective policy
   instruments exist to thwart such seepage. Here, therefore, an
   innovative approach to facilitate local purchasing amongst rural
   dwellers is evaluated: Local Exchange and Trading Systems (LETS).
   Reporting empirical evidence from both a national survey of United
   Kingdom LETS and a membership survey of Totnes LETS in Devon, this
   paper finds that LETS are rapidly growing in rural areas and are not
   only encouraging local purchasing but are also rebuilding local social
   networks and enabling some of those marginalised from employment to
   gain access to work and credit. As such, they amalgamate both economic
   and community development. To further improve their effectiveness,
   several barriers to their development are identified and solutions
   offered to how these may be overcome. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

   disabilities from a developmental synthesis perspective. The
   developmental synthesis perspective views social growth as the
   integration of biological, psychological, and sociological features.
   Issues in the social skills deficit framework are examined along with
   the theoretical foundations of the developmental synthesis perspective.
   From this discussion, it is concluded that social interventions for
   students with disabilities should include a focus on the
   characteristics of the classroom social network as well as the
   characteristics of the individual. The literature on the formation of
   classroom social networks and their role in individuals' behavior
   development is reviewed. Three critical points emerge from this review:
   (a) Formal and informal social processes are likely to constrain the
   social opportunities of students with disabilities in both special and
   regular education placements; (b) following from these constraints,
   students with disabilities are at risk for associating with peers who
   negatively influence their social growth; and (c) such associations are
   likely to impede or prevent positive outcomes for social skills
   training programs. Implications for the delivery of educational
   services, as well as social interventions, are considered and future
   research needs are briefly outlined.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE

ID RESOURCE MOBILIZATION; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; PARTICIPATION; NETWORKS
AB Theory: Expectations about why groups and social movements differ in
   terms of their support for confrontational tactics can be applied to
   subgroups within a larger set of political activists.
   Hypotheses: Political distrust, personal suffering, ideological
   intensity, and divergent social locations encourage support for ACT-UP
   and disruptive political tactics among AIDS activists, with strong
   mediating effects being exerted by sexual orientation.
   Methods: The data are based on a 1992 national mail survey of AIDS
   activists. OLS regression was used to analyze the sample as a whole and
   the subsamples of gay and straight respondents.
   Results: Whereas distrust and dissatisfaction had a small impact,
   personal suffering, ideological commitment, and divergent social
   locations tended to increase support for disruptive behavior. These
   relationships differed, however, among gays and straights due to their
   immersion in disparate social networks and milieus. The results
   highlight the importance of within-movement heterogeneity.

SO POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY

   PARTICIPATION; CHOICE; RECRUITMENT; INEQUALITY; ACTIVISM
AB Students of political violence have often suggested that socioeconomic
   conditions play a significant role in explaining the individual-level
   predisposition toward violence. Relative deprivation theories propose
   that a person's socioeconomic situation is related to political
   violence, but only if the individual's situation is seen relative to
   other individuals and groups in society. Unfortunately, most tests of
   this premise have been inconclusive. To a large extent, the problem
   centers on the lack of appropriate data; relative deprivation theories
   posit a relationship between the individual and the context, requiring
   that we merge individual-level and collective-level data. This study
   examines individuals' socioeconomic positions within the context of
   their neighborhoods. Two contextual effects are identified. First,
   consistent with theories of relative deprivation, support for violence
   is partly determined by the relationship between individual-level and
   neighborhood-level economic conditions. For instance, poor persons who
   reside in relatively well-off neighborhoods are highly supportive of
   violence. Second, the level of socioeconomic heterogeneity within a
   neighborhood moderates a person's perceptions of deprivation, and
   consequently this person's support for political violence. These
   findings suggest that perceptions of deprivation originate through a
   complex process centering on socioeconomic information from
   individuals' social contexts.

   FOLLOW-UP; MORTALITY; BEREAVEMENT; RISK; MEN; PREVALENCE; FAILURE
AB Marital status and other socioeconomic and clinical factors were
   examined as predictors of survival in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
   using data from a hospital-based study in Washington, DC. Twenty-five
   (18.1%) of the cases (n = 138) were single, 66 (47.8%) were married, 25
   (18.1%) were divorced or separated, and 22 (15.9%) were widowed.
   Married patients were more likely to be male, to have an annual
   household income grater than $15,000, and to live with another person
   (p less than or equal to 0.01) as compared with those who were single,
   widowed, divorced or separated. Widowed patients were older on average
   and more likely to abstain from drinking alcohol. The cumulative
   survival among widowed patients at 12 and 24 months was 54.6 and 48.5%,
   respectively, as compared with 75.8 and 59.0% among single patients and
   80.0 and 71.2% among married patients. The survival of divorced or
   separated patients was relatively good with a cumulative survival of
   84.0% at both 12 and 24 months. Older age, lower ejection fraction,
   ventricular arrhythmias, bundle branch block, and marital status were
   significant predictors of survival in univariate analysis using the
   proportional hazards model. In multivariable analysis, age, race,
   ejection fraction, and marital status were statistically significant
   independent predictors of survival, with single patients with
   idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy having a poorer survival than those
   who were married (adjusted RR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-6.2, p < 0.05). The
   observed association with marital status may be explained by
   psychosocial factors not examined in the present study such as quality
   of social network or psychological stress.

TI Social inequalities in the experience of illness in Sweden: A ''double
   suffering''
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE reported morbidity; illness; health inequalities; self-rated health;
   social class; Sweden
ID EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; HEALTH-STATUS; DETERMINANTS; DIMENSIONS
AB This paper analyses the factors involved in differences in the
   experience of long-term illness (severe and non-severe illness), as
   measured in terms of self-reported frequency and intensity of symptoms.
   The study has a cross-sectional design. It uses a database from the
   Survey of Living Conditions of Statistics Sweden, and treats a
   representative sample of the employed Swedish population (n=13,501),
   aged between 16 and 65, interviewed over the period 1986-89. The
   results show that male manual workers report more non-severe and severe
   illness than non-manual workers, and that manual and lower-level
   non-manual female workers report more severe illness, but not nonsevere
   illness, than intermediate/higher-level non-manual working females. The
   observed class differences in experience of severity of illness are
   partly explained by the factors investigated (job demands, personal
   economic difficulties, smoking daily, weak social network) in the case
   of men, and virtually entirely in the case of women. Other ill-health
   dimensions, such as self-rated general health and impaired working
   capacity, prove to be related to severity of illness, the latter being
   more strongly associated with experience of severe illness than the
   former irrespective of social class. The results lend support to the
   hypothesis that manual classes are subjected to what might be called
   ''double suffering''; they have more long-term illnesses and also
   experience these illnesses with greater intensity and frequency.

AB The present study compared the social support of 92 homeless and 115
   permanently housed low-income mothers. Results revealed that homeless
   mothers were in significantly less contact with their
   friends/relatives, could count on fewer people for help and child care
   in times of need, and felt their social networks were less helpful in
   raising their families than housed mothers. Further, longer stays in
   homelessness were predictive of less helpful social networks, which may
   hinder a family's return to permanent housing. Implications of these
   findings and recommendations for family service providers are discussed.

AB In this report, severely mentally ill adults describe their experiences
   of long-term illness. Forty-three research participants completed Life
   Chart Interviews covering their personal history since the onset of
   their psychiatric disorder. Participants appeared to be generally
   reliable informants on their treatment histories. They indicated that
   individual learning and personal choices influenced the course of the
   psychiatric disorder over time, including decisions about use of
   treatment and environmental support. These results support the value of
   life-context approach to research on severe mental illness. (C) 1996 by

AB This study examined the teenager's transition to mothering as shaped by
   family caregiving practices. Conflict over infant caregiving
   characterized families who demonstrated an ethic of adversarial care.
   In contrast, families with a responsive ethic attended to the mother
   and baby without taking over and shared caregiving in a high fluid
   manner. In articulating the experiential worlds of family members, this
   study describes their situated possibilities as the basis for
   developing clinical practices that promote responsive caregiving.

AB Qualitative research which describes the social behaviour of illicit
   drug users has a key role to play in refining community-based
   interventions. Such research has been used for many years in drugs
   research, but during the AIDS epoch its practical application has been
   most fully realised. Data are presented to illustrate the way in which
   qualitative research can inform the development of outreach initiatives
   targeted towards illicit drug injectors, not in contact with treatment
   services. Social networks of injectors from three sites in England were
   studied and we describe the strategies they adopted to reduce the
   likelihood of viral infection. We show how informal coping strategies,
   such as personalising syringes and ensuring a supply of sterile
   injecting equipment through secondary distribution can be integrated
   into peer education outreach. We also examine the management of risk
   and the social meanings that perpetuate sharing of injecting equipment,
   describe situations and scenarios in which syringe sharing is likely to
   occur, and suggest how such research can assist the evaluation and
   evolution of relevant and targeted interventions.

AB Geriatric assessment has become an established part of medical
   practice, a trend driven by the growing population of older patients,
   positive patient outcomes, and increased interest in controlling
   healthcare costs, Geriatric assessments, is a diagnostic process that
   can be performed in a variety of clinical settings, including the
   primary care office. The interdisciplinary assessment team usually
   includes at least three members: a physician, a nurse, and a social
   worker. Patients who appear to derive the greatest benefit are over age
   75, have mild to moderate disabilities, may be at risk of nursing home
   placement, and may have a poor social network. For optimal
   effectiveness, assessment must be coupled with a comprehensive
   therapeutic plan and long-term follow-up.

AB Objective: To provide time-trend estimates of HIV-1 prevalence among
   injecting drug users (IDU) in London.
   Design: HIV-1 prevalence and HIV testing behaviour were measured in
   four serial point prevalence surveys of IDU recruited at multiple sites
   in community-based nontreatment and drug treatment settings between
   1990 and 1993.
   Methods: Community subjects were recruited through social network
   sampling by trained indigenous interviewers; treatment subjects were
   interviewed at agencies. With informed consent, subjects responded to a
   structured questionnaire covering risk behaviour. Volunteered saliva
   samples were tested anonymously for anti-HIV-1. Statistical comparisons
   across years were examined using mixed binomial logistic and loglinear
   models. Pearson's chi(2) and Fisher's exact tests were also used for
   some two-group comparisons.
   Results: Similar samples were recruited each year. HIV-1 prevalence
   rate declined from 12.8% in 1990, 9.8% in 1991, 7.0% in 1992, to 6.9%
   in 1993. The statistical modelling suggested that the overall trend in
   prevalence rates was one of decelerating decline. There was no
   difference in prevalence rate by gender and length of injecting. Less
   than one-half (46%) had received a named HIV test. Over one-half of the
   HIV-positive IDU were unaware of their status.
   Conclusions: The pattern of decline in HIV-1 prevalence rate is
   attributed to changes in risk behaviour following HIV prevention
   interventions.

AB The relationship between social network structural and support
   characteristics and onset of new or recurrent activities of daily
   living (ADL) disability was examined in a cohort of older men and
   women. No significant protective effects were found for network
   structural or support characteristics. However, greater frequency of
   instrumental support was associated with significantly increased risk
   of ADL disability among men; a similar though nonsignificant pattern
   was seen among women. These findings indicate that receipt of more
   instrumental support may not have uniformly beneficial effects on
   functional status. They serve to underscore the need for more
   comprehensive research, examining both the positive and negative
   effects of social interactions on health and functioning.
