<p>Alberta Braces For Flu Outbreak</p>
<p>Alberta could postpone elective surgeries, call in retired doctors and nurses to help, and set up triage centres in tents to ease the pressure on hospital emergency rooms if the H1N1 flu outbreak returns in even greater force as expected this fall.</p>

<p>Family Haunted By Loss Of Tot 50 Years Later</p>
<p>More than 50 years after three-year-old Larry Leroy Nelson was swept away in the Bow River, the case continues to haunt his family.

<p>Canada</p>
<p>Tories Slammed On Clemency Policy</p>

<p>NDP Aborts Name Change</p>
<p>The federal NDP doused weeks of speculation about a possible name change by simply ignoring the matter --and sidestepping other attempts to modernize the party--at its convention in Halifax on Sunday.</p>

<p>World</p>
<p>Hurricane Season Coming</p>
<p>The Atlantic hurricane season gathered pace Sunday as forecasters said tropical storm Claudette--the third system to form in two days--swirled off northwestern Florida, expected to dump heavy rains.</p>
<p>Ana, which formed as a tropical storm early Saturday, raced toward the Caribbean, prompting storm watches from Puerto Rico to the Leeward Islands.</p>

<p>Gunther's Builds Clientele From The Interiors Out</p>
<p>General manager Kurt Norlen says the name doesn't quite match the reality at Gunther's Building Centre Ltd. The specialty interior finish house is no lumber yard. It wholesalers to home builders, contractors, finishers and renovators. Gunther's offers products including subfloor underlay, doors, mouldings, crown moulding, hardware and plywood; basically anything to finish the inside of a house.</p>
<p>Small Business, Page C8</p>
<p>Inflation Expected To Be Stubbornly Negative</p>
<p>The coming week's inflation report for Canada is expected to show July was the second straight month in which consumer prices were lower than a year earlier. June's consumer-price index was 0.3 per cent lower than 12 months earlier, which was the first negative inflation rate since 1994 and the biggest drop in prices since 1955.</p>

<p>Pee-Wee Herman Overjoyed To Be Back</p>
<p>The red bow tie. The form-fitting grey suit. The white loafers. Oh, and that laugh. Pee-wee Herman is back and his creator, Paul Reubens, is overjoyed -- and more than a little bit nervous, too.</p>

<p>Greenpeace Film Targets Alberta's Oilsands</p>
<p>Since filmmaker Peter Mettler is probably best known for his trippy, poetic and Genie-winning 2002 documentary Gambling, Gods and LSD, this is perhaps an appropriately surreal explanation as to how the filmmaker entered the divisive world of the oilsands debate.</p>

<p>It's An Odd World</p>
<p>Trumped-Up Charges</p>
<p>When the tenant failed to pay $87,000 in rent in April and May at Trump Plaza in New York City, the landlord did what Donald Trump would surely do: It began eviction proceedings. However, the tenant in this case is Donald Trump's Trump Corp., which leases the space from the current landlord, the Trump Plaza Owners co-op.</p>

<p>Re: "Schools brace for H1N1 resurgence," Aug. 12.</p>
<p>As an employee of the Calgary Catholic school division, I was interested in how different school boards are preparing for the flu season.</p>
<p>In our school district, hand sanitizers are not permitted because they contain alcohol, so teachers and staff have not had them in schools. We were also told to have sick children brought to the office and put in the nurse's room until a parent or guardian can pick them up.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no supervision in the nurse's room, so the sick child remains in the office among staff and students. Parents can take a long time to pick up a child. Some of them may travel to work by bus, need to get their position covered or may not be able to come at all, which means the student remains in school.</p>
<p>You also mentioned that schools would be putting up posters on how to wash hands properly. At times, we don't have soap in the washrooms. Students empty the soap containers and if we put bars in, they flush them or break them up. The custodial staff do the best they can considering they are extremely short-staffed. If the H1N1 virus hits the schools, there will be major outbreaks among staff and students. We are not prepared, and unless major changes are put into place, we will have a long season ahead of us.</p>

</div><div>Michelle Lang   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>

<p>Fighting The Flu</p>
<p>Today: Is Alberta ready?</p>
<p>Tuesday: School preparedness</p>
<p>Wednesday: Protecting the most vulnerable</p>
<p>Thursday: The flu and you</p>
<p>Friday: Business girds for H1N1</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Alberta is preparing a wide-ranging pandemic plan that could see elective surgeries postponed, and retired doctors and nurses called in for help should the H1N1 influenza outbreak worsen and sicken large numbers of people.</p>
<p>Top provincial health officials say they are also prepared to create triage centres outside of hospitals, possibly in tents or large medical clinics, to take pressure off emergency rooms if there is a significant surge of H1N1 cases.</p>
<p>As Alberta braces for the return of the so-called swine flu virus this fall, officials are planning for the health system to face a dual challenge: demand for medical services will grow at the same time staff are at risk of becoming ill themselves.</p>
<p>The province's plan anticipates nurses and doctors will be off sick at the same rate as the general population--between five per cent and 20 per cent of workers may need to remain at home, depending on the severity of the outbreak.</p>
<p>The situation could force hospitals to scale back in nonessential areas to free up staff and resources to handle H1N1 cases. For example, hospitals could delay elective surgeries and clinics for chronic problems, such as high blood pressure.</p>
<p>"When we get a pandemic and we have lots of people sick, the health system won't necessarily work the way it usually does," Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health for the province's superboard, said in an interview with the Herald.</p>
<p>"There will be some different ways of doing business, because we'll have more sick people and potentially fewer staff."</p>
<p>Predy and other public health officials say Alberta is ready for H1N1, which has infected at least 1,648 people in this province, to return this fall.</p>
<p>But those who have been affected by the virus question how the medical system--already short-staffed and strapped for space--will cope if the situation worsened significantly.</p>
<p>"The hospitals are really, really busy," said Stella Peeace, a longtime friend of Calgarian Vanessa Bluebell, a young mother of four who died in July after contracting the virus.</p>
<p>"There are already three-or four-hour( emergency)waits. I don't know what they'll do."</p>
<p>Indeed, experts say many health facilities in Calgary operate at 99 per cent occupancy during normal times. If H1N1 became a more serious pandemic, they say health officials will face some tough choices.</p>
<p>"There could be a series of quite unpleasant and difficult decisions . . . about who gets into hospital and who doesn't," said Dr. Jim Dickinson, a University of Calgary flu expert.</p>
<p>Debate about Alberta's readiness for a second wave of H1N1 comes as Canada has confirmed more than 10,000 cases of the virus, which has been associated with 66 deaths in the country.</p>
<p>H1N1, which first appeared in Mexico this spring and has since been declared a global pandemic, has so far been behaving similar to typical seasonal influenzas.</p>
<p>But physicians anticipate H1N1 will infect greater numbers of people than regular influenza because it's a new virus and the population has little immunity against it.</p>
<p>Alberta's chief medical officer of health said the province is preparing for worst-case scenarios, but it's hoping to prevent a significant increase in cases.</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau said Alberta Health is anticipating government will have enough doses of H1N1 vaccine for every Albertan who wants one by November.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services is still working on plans for administering the shots, but it's expected the superboard will hold mass vaccination clinics.</p>
<p>"Most of our focus is going to be minimizing the probability (a worse-case) situation occurs," says Corriveau. "The ultimate strategy is making sure we have the vaccine and we're able to deliver it."</p>
<p>But if the second wave of H1N1 is more severe, Alberta's plan calls for reduced services in some areas so staff can be redeployed to care for H1N1 patients.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services is developing training programs so nurses and other health workers can quickly learn a job if they are moved to a new unit.</p>
<p>Regulatory bodies for physicians and registered nurses, meanwhile, say they will consider allowing recent retirees or students who are nearing the end of their studies to assist, although they may have restrictions on how they can practise.</p>
<p>The Alberta Medical Association said that, in a worse-case scenario, generalist physicians like family doctors may be asked to work in hospitals.</p>
<p>The pandemic plan also calls for officials to open flu assessment and triage centres out of hospital if large numbers of patients become ill.</p>
<p>Predy said Edmonton has a triage tent that could be set up for this purpose and he said large medical clinics have come forward in other parts of the province to house the service.</p>
<p>In addition to health system planning, City of Calgary officials say they are well prepared for the fall.</p>
<p>The city has nearly$2 million worth of equipment such as surgical gloves, goggles and masks.</p>
<p>City officials from 31 municipal departments and agencies are also meeting regularly to devise a plan that will keep the city running even if the H1N1 virus spreads through the ranks of its 14,000 employees.</p>
<p>"We need to ensure that the essential components of these businesses are maintained, even if we have a 30 to 40 per cent absence," said Tom Sampson, deputy chief of the city's Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>As in health care, some departments will scale back if necessary and redeploy workers to where they are needed.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>It's time to use proper name for this flu</b>
</div><div>651 words</div><div>17 August 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>Pork farmers and one of the nation's biggest newsrooms, the CBC, just can't see eye to eye on what to call the H1N1 flu, popularly (but erroneously, say some farmers) dubbed swine flu.</p>
<p>So now, the corporation's ombudsman is being asked to settle the matter. On the farming side, the charge is being led by Gordon Sloan. He's a semi-retired provincial employee who lives in Guelph and has agricultural roots and farm relatives near Chatham. Sloan is attempting something that's eluded others - namely, getting farmer-friendly terminology accepted at the highest media level, in hopes other scribes will follow.</p>
<p>There's a lot at stake.</p>
<p>Most Canadians get health-related information from the media. If readers, listeners and viewers are constantly subjected to the term swine flu, it's likely to take hold in their psyche. And it has. Sloan says that's led to unjust bias against pork. In fact, he (and many others in agriculture) maintain the term swine flu is contributing significantly to the depressed pork market.</p>
<p>Farmers who raise pigs haven't made any money in at least two years, and Sloan says the prospects are dismal as long as the swine flu moniker, not to mention the affliction itself, lingers in the minds and bodies of Canadians. Sloan argues that because the World Health Organization adopted the term H1N1, media should do the same.</p>
<p>When the disease first appeared, confusion reigned supreme. Popular terminology was up in the air.</p>
<p>You may remember the search for an appropriate name even led to the possibility of calling it Mexican flu. But the World Health Organization is struggling to manage media activity on this disease, all the way from its source to its treatment.</p>
<p>For example, on its website, the organization says it knows some media have expressed concern about the flu vaccine safety. "The public needs to be reassured that regulatory procedures in place for the licensing of pandemic vaccines, including procedures for expediting regulatory approval, are rigorous and do not compromise safety or quality controls, it says. Gee. Doesn't that sound like "Trust me, I'm from the government?"</p>
<p>The media is supposed to be independent of the government, so the CBC and others are forging ahead.</p>
<p>Sloan sent me an email to him from Esther Enkin, executive editor of CBC News, in which she acknowledged the industry's many challenges. She says the CBC "would not deliberately set out to make it worse." But, she says, the pork industry's woes run deep. She cites soaring feed costs, the recession, new U.S. labelling regulations, currency fluctuations, changing consumption habits and import restrictions imposed after the flu outbreak, all having contributed to reduced demand for pork.</p>
<p>"It's not at all clear that the term ‘swine flu' has had a significant, or any, effect on what appears to be a longer-term trend resulting from substantial and quantifiable causes," she adds. I don't buy that.</p>
<p>There is nothing neutral about the term swine flu. If the country's major media outlet associates any emerging disease with a specific commodity, see what happens to sales. But in the news business, do you stop using a term because it injures? No. In theory, you are not beholden to anyone. You only stop it when the term is wrong.</p>
<p>The CBC's Enkin claims the term swine flu is accurate and clear, but acknowledges the disease does indeed contain some genetic elements of bird flu and human flu, too. Sloan disagrees with Enkin's interpretation of what's right, and has taken the matter to the CBC ombudsman.</p>
<p>At best, he says, the CBC's policy is undermining the reputation of the pork industry...and at worst, it may be the proverbial straw that takes the industry down.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Can new federal funds save hog farmers?</b>
</div><div>Brent Davis   </div>
<div>Record staff</div>
<div>635 words</div><div>17 August 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>Even with an influx of federal funds announced this weekend, local pork producers say their battered industry is at a crossroads.</p>
<p>No one doubts Canada could be a competitive player on international markets. But can hog farmers survive long enough to prove it?</p>
<p>"We've gone through over three years of a down cycle that has just brought this industry to its knees," said Curtis Littlejohn, a farmer southeast of Ayr and one of two Ontario representatives on the Canadian Pork Council. "The government is trying to control the crash."</p>
<p>You name it, hog farmers have encountered it: Soaring feed prices. A rising dollar that has crippled exports. New country-of-origin labelling rules in the U.S.</p>
<p>The arrival of the H1N1 virus and its initial "swine flu" moniker "was the straw that broke the camel's back," New Dundee-area farmer Stewart Cressman said.</p>
<p>"This year has been extremely discouraging," he said. "People are taking a long, hard look in the mirror and asking ‘Is this where my future lies?'"</p>
<p>Laurent Pellerin, president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, said hogs are now going for less than $1 a head when they are worth about $200 each.</p>
<p>Now, the federal government has stepped forward with a three-part plan that leaves farmers to make some tough decisions.</p>
<p>A $75 million transition program will help farmers leave the industry, in an effort to reduce a significant oversupply issue in Canada.</p>
<p>Long-term loans with government-backed credit will be available for those with viable operations who want to remain in business. The value of the loan program wasn't disclosed.</p>
<p>A $17 million marketing fund will promote pork products and try to recover lost markets and build new ones, particularly at the domestic level.</p>
<p>"We have to face the reality that some producers will leave the industry and we need to reduce our current over-supply," Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said on Saturday.</p>
<p>"Producers who weather this global economic storm will have to restructure their businesses to adjust to new and emerging market realities."</p>
<p>Ritz couldn't say how many farmers will leave the industry under the buyout or how much compensation individuals will get.</p>
<p>The restructuring plan was announced at press events in Winnipeg, Quebec, and at Clare Schlegel's farm near Shakespeare.</p>
<p>"It's a positive step in the right direction," Schlegel said. "Canada and southwestern Ontario have all the right resources to be a world player."</p>
<p>But he admitted it is a critical time.</p>
<p>If too many farmers throw in the towel in the short term, who will be left to rebuild?</p>
<p>"When the investment leaves, it doesn't come back overnight," he said.</p>
<p>"Canada risks losing the entire business."</p>
<p>Bob Hunsberger, chair of Breslau-based Progressive Pork Producers Co-operative Inc., said the federal funds will provide some incentive for things to change.</p>
<p>"But it's certainly not making up for the losses that hog farmers have incurred in the last couple of years."</p>
<p>And it's a far cry from the $800 million that the Canadian Pork Council was appealing for – and that was before the H1N1 virus reared its head.</p>
<p>Littlejohn said the government must act to ensure adequate funds are available within a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>"This industry cannot wait until October for cash," he said.</p>
<p>On his diversified farm near New Dundee, which includes beef cattle, Cressman's hog barns have sat empty since January, in an economic environment when raising pigs was "at best a break-even proposition."</p>
<p>Even so, he still thinks things may be "bleakest before the dawn.</p>
<p>"I have faith that we will eventually have a viable and very robust industry here," Cressman said.</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- You know those pesky political flyers that land on your doorstep?</p>
<p>The ones that we pay for as taxpayers so MPs can speak to us about what is going on in government but which political parties have started using as partisan tools to attack each other?</p>
<p>Get ready for them to go live.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg new media design firm, Mars Hill Group, has landed a contract with the federal Conservatives to "deliver their message to supporters nation-wide."</p>
<p>The company's website says they will be helping individual Conservative MPs and Senators make personal, customized videos. The first one will star former CTV host turned Conservative Senator Mike Duffy and will "start hitting inboxes early this fall."</p>
<p>Now don't worry. These aren't going to be paid for by John Q. Canadian. There is nothing in the parliamentary allowance to pay for video messaging. At least not yet.</p>
<p>But maybe they'll help the fledgling video creations already out there by MPs.</p>
<p>Like Manitoba's own James Bezan.</p>
<p>Bezan, the Conservative MP from Selkirk-Interlake, has launched his own YouTube channel and has three episodes so far.</p>
<p>The introductory video comes complete with Bezan riding up on his horse, Woody, and has him delivering an afternoon-nap inducing statistical profile of his riding.</p>
<p>But Bezan should get credit for trying. Politicians can't rely on a basic website to reach voters anymore.</p>
<p>They need to go all Barack Obama and hit computer screens and blackberries everywhere with tweets and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> messages and YouTube.</p>
<p>So Bezan might be onto something if he can remember the camera company is called "<span class="companylink">Kodak</span>" not "Kodiak", convince Woody to stop trying to head-butt him out of the shot, and get some editing assistance from Mars Hill so he is no longer heard in the videos telling people when to start speaking.</p>
<p>It's been four years since Canada and the United States announced at the 11th hour of the opening of the Devils Lake outlet that they'd come to an agreement to have the U.S. build a permanent filter on the outlet.</p>
<p>In exchange Manitoba agreed to do something about the road along the U.S. border between Manitoba and North Dakota that acted like a dike and kept farm fields on the U.S. side sodden in the spring while the Manitoba side was high and dry.</p>
<p>The agreement has gone nowhere.</p>
<p>There is no filter on the outlet beyond the temporary gravel filter that was put in as a stop-gap measure. Manitoba said it won't do anything to the road until North Dakota and the U.S. live up to their promises.</p>
<p>Legislators from Midwestern states and Canada's prairie provinces are trying to light a fire under everyone yet again.</p>
<p>At the 64th annual meeting of the Midwestern Legislative Conference in Kansas last week they passed a resolution asking both sides to live up their agreements.</p>
<p>Winnipeg NDP MP Jim Maloway, who attended the event, said he was surprised the resolution passed. Maloway worked on the resolution but couldn't introduce it himself because he's not from the U.S. But two North Dakota state legislators agreed and the resolution went through by a vote of 41 to 28.</p>
<p>It's not overwhelming support since there are over 1,500 legislators in the conference and about one-third of them attended the event. And Maloway said the vote took place on the last day when everyone was packing to go home.</p>
<p>Either way, the resolution will go to the White House, Ottawa and the provincial and state governments and maybe this thing can finally get resolved once and for all.</p>
<p>Manitoba was overrepresented this week at the special Health committee hearing on H1N1 influenza. Conservative MP Joy Smith was the chair while Liberal MP Anita Neville and NDP MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis were both in attendance.</p>
<p>With Manitoba first nations being ground zero of this flu's impact on reserves it is perhaps fitting that we had so many seats around that table.</p>
<p>But Manitoba Premier Gary Doer made an appearance twice and he wasn't anywhere near the nation's capital.</p>
<p>Doer -- who has always seemed to pride himself on coming up with the sound bite du jour for us short-attention span media types -- was quoted during the meeting by both Wasylcyia-Leis and Dr. John Maxted, from the College of Family Physicians of Canada.</p>
<p>His quote?</p>
<p>Comparing the H1N1 influenza to a "truck coming around the corner."</p>
<p>It wasn't Doer who had the quote of the day however.</p>
<p>That went to another Manitoban: Wasylycia-Leis, who fresh off an interview with Toronto's Citytv about federal stimulus cash for tourism being used to help bring former U.S. President Bill Clinton to a Toronto speaking engagement.</p>
<p>When she was criticizing the government for forcing the provinces to cover 40 per cent of the cost of H1N1 vaccine Wasylycia-Leis couldn't help but bring it up.</p>
<p>"You have money through this stimulus package to bring in Bill Clinton," she said. "Why don't you have money for the vaccine."</p>

<p>WINNIPEG -- With the worst hog market in 60 years draining a nest-egg that took him almost as long to build, Bill Vaags was in the mood for some good news when he attended a Winnipeg press conference Saturday.</p>
<p>He joined several other pig farmers in the audience to find out what kind of lifeline Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz would toss their ailing industry.</p>
<p>But at the close of Mr. Ritz's speech, any excitement was gone.</p>
<p>“It's worth nothing,” Mr. Vaags said of the federal government's new restructuring plan for the pig industry. “They made it look like they're offering something, but there is really very little there.”</p>
<p>Some producers used stronger language yesterday, calling the package a “betrayal” of an industry that Ottawa and the provinces were encouraging farmers to enter only a few short years ago.</p>
<p>The federal package is a three-part plan: launch a $17-million marketing venture to sell Canadian pork internationally; offer government-backed loans to farmers with viable hog operations; and set aside $75-million to buy the worst-off farmers out of the business.</p>
<p>“We have to face the reality that some producers will leave the industry and we need to reduce our current over-supply,” Mr. Ritz said. “Producers who weather this global economic storm will have to restructure their businesses to adjust to new and emerging market realities.”</p>
<p>Trade restrictions place the federal government in a difficult position. By offering too much financial support, it risks igniting a challenge from American farmers arguing that a bailout amounts to subsidization. Too meagre a package, and it risks alienating an industry.</p>
<p>While appreciating that delicate balance, producers had been anticipating a larger bailout, closer in size to an $800-million proposal that the Canadian Pork Council submitted last month.</p>
<p>“We were hoping for considerably more,” said George Matheson, another Manitoba pig farmer. “There's definitely some disappointment out there.”</p>
<p>There's also confusion. Mr. Ritz couldn't elaborate Saturday on how many farmers would be bought out or how much cash they would receive.</p>
<p>“I really don't know how they plan to calculate this,” said Mr. Matheson, who, like other farmers, is currently losing about $40 on every pig he sells.</p>
<p>New country-of-origin labelling laws in the U.S., a strengthening Canadian dollar, high feed costs and groundless worldwide concerns that the H1N1 virus is spread through pork have combined to weaken prices and highlight a large glut in the North American market.</p>
<p>The apparent oversupply comes a decade after federal and provincial governments were encouraging farmer to invest in hog barns. Fifteen years ago, Canada produced 16 million pigs, a number that has since doubled.</p>
<p>“The feds felt they had all the trade agreements in place, so they offered technical expertise and loans,” said Ian Wishart, president of Keystone Agricultural Producers, a farmers' lobby group in Manitoba. “There were a lot of government staff saying that this was a good industry to get into. Some feel they've been led down the garden path. … There is a feeling of betrayal out there.”</p>
<p>Back at his farm 22 kilometres east of Winnipeg, Mr. Vaags knows that hindsight won't bring back his nest-egg, but he can't help questioning past decisions.</p>
<p>“We have to wonder why the industry expanded so much in the last 10 or 15 years,” he said. “Maybe that was a mistake. A few guys at that press conference, they wondered why they bothered coming out, because they're quitting the business anyway.”</p>

<p>When Prime Minister Stephen Harper visits Pangnirtung, Nunavut, later this week, he's sure to get a warm greeting. After all, his government is contributing $25-million to the 1,300-person community to build a new small-craft harbour aimed at bolstering the local fishing industry.</p>
<p>The harbour, whose designation as a “priority project” in the federal budget in January came as a welcome surprise for Pangnirtung, is an important plank in the Harper government's commitment to building much-needed infrastructure in Nunavut.</p>
<p>But today, the Prime Minister arrives in Iqaluit, where the welcome may be a little cooler. There has so far been no infrastructure money to replace a gravel wharf in the 7,000-person territorial capital, where it takes up to a week for the most basic goods to be offloaded from boats bringing them in – “stone-age” infrastructure, as the territory's transportation planning director calls it.</p>
<p>Iqaluit has spent the past decade campaigning for a deep-sea port. Mr. Harper's Conservatives promised a big marine project in the North as part of the 2006 election campaign, but ended up choosing to refurbish a port near an abandoned mine in uninhabited Nanisivik.</p>
<p>Since coming to power in 2006, Mr. Harper's government has pledged billions of dollars for Arctic development – money that has gone toward everything from military bases to houses to seabed mapping. But many of the territory's most basic infrastructural needs remain unaddressed.</p>
<p>Attempting to categorize and prioritize the North's infrastructure needs can be overwhelming, says Rob Huebert, associate director for the Centre for Military and Strategic Studies at the University of Calgary.</p>
<p>“What infrastructure do they need? Everything. We talk about the Canadian dream, we talk about the manner in which Canada was supposed to be joined by infrastructure. Well, it just doesn't exist.”</p>
<p>The following are four projects that come up most often in conversations with Northern residents, politicians, advocates and academics when discussing what infrastructure is needed most urgently.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>IQALUIT DEEP-SEA PORT</p>
<p>Iqaluit's bay has one of the most dramatic tides in the world: The ebb and flow spans eight metres over kilometre-long tidal flats.</p>
<p>They're impressive, but they can be a headache when it comes to offloading cargo brought in by boat or travelling by sea to and from the territorial capital. It can take days to do jobs that could otherwise be finished in a matter of hours as boats wait for high tide.</p>
<p>A proper port would lower the cost of living, boost the fishing industry and make it far easier to do business in the capital city, says Iqaluit community economic development officer Erin Gordey.</p>
<p>Over the past 10 years, Ms. Gordey says, multiple feasibility studies have shown the need for a port, which wouldn't come cheaply – $50-million would be “a start.”</p>
<p>John Hawkins, Nunavut's director of transportation policy and planning, says even the basic costs of a port would be double the department's annual budget.</p>
<p>Nunavut is embarking on another ambitious design and feasibility study, but it likely won't be finished for another 18 months – too late to profit from the federal government's stimulus funds for “shovel-ready” projects.</p>
<p>“We would be able to ease the congestion, to ease the cost of doing business here,” Mr. Hawkins says. “We are a coastal community, the capital of a territory, and it just doesn't seem right to be back in the Stone Age as far as moving cargo goes.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>HOUSING</p>
<p>When the Nunavut government put together a 10-year housing plan in 2004, half of the territory's Inuit lived in overcrowded conditions – almost 40 per cent of them classified as “core need,” meaning they're simply not able to access acceptable housing. At the time, the Nunavut Housing Corporation estimated it would need twice its annual budget to build the 3,000 affordable housing units required to bring overcrowding to a level on par with the rest of Canada.</p>
<p>“The Inuit of Nunavut are locked in a housing crisis that is worsening daily as the population booms and existing housing stock ages,” the report stated, estimating that the territory would need $1.9-billion to make up the shortfall between 2006 and 2016, by which time seven in 10 Inuit in Nunavut are projected to be living in overcrowded conditions.</p>
<p>In the five years since the report's publication, the affordable-housing deficit has grown at an estimated 250 to 300 units a year. The federal government has contributed $300-million over the past several years, enabling the territory to build about 1,000 units.</p>
<p>“It still doesn't give us enough houses,” says Nunavut MLA Ron Elliott. He says overcrowding – exacerbated by a harsh climate, remote geography, a small population base and the high costs of labour and materials – also makes it more difficult for Nunavut residents to claw their way out of poverty.</p>
<p>As flu season begins, he adds, many fear severe overcrowding will speed the spread of the H1N1 virus that has already infected close to 500 people in the territory.</p>
<p>“You have houses that are overcrowded, one person gets sick, how do you isolate that person?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>BROADBAND WIRELESS</p>
<p>In a territory of almost 32,000 people – most under 25 – scattered across 1.9 million square kilometres with little in the way of transportation infrastructure, Internet access is an issue.</p>
<p>Web connectivity is in huge demand in Nunavut – for educational purposes, to aid industry and to keep people connected in an area defined by isolation, says Lorraine Thomas, the interim executive director of the Nunavut Broadband Development Corporation.</p>
<p>Founded in 2003, the group set up its network, called Qiniq, with the help of a grant from the federal government to subsidize half the cost of the first 2,000 users. There are now 5,000 Qiniq subscribers and thousands more users in the territory's 25 communities.</p>
<p>Ms. Thomas says the necessary satellite broadband is expensive, and Nunavut is the only jurisdiction in Canada to rely solely on satellite for its Internet usage.</p>
<p>Qiniq is billed as high-speed broadband, but that's a bit of a misnomer, Ms. Thomas says: When not bogged down by thousands of users logging on at once, it runs at 256 kilobytes a second – five times the speed of wireless, but half the traditionally accepted definition of high speed. This makes it possible to use Skype and take long-distance courses, but the territory's geoscientists and its nascent film industry, both of which need to send large, complex files, are largely out of luck.</p>
<p>The corporation received a grant last year from Infrastructure Canada to cover four years of expanded basic services and half the costs of new subscribers beyond the initial 2,000.</p>
<p>Ms. Thomas would like to see it made available (and affordable) to more people, with an expanded bandwidth.</p>
<p>The smallest, most remote communities present the most money-losing proposition to Internet providers, she argues, but they are also the ones that need Internet access the most, for everything from banking to education to marketing a service – none of which can be done in person.</p>
<p>“If we can't make it work in Grise Fiord, we can't make it work in Nunavut,” she says. “What options do you have for economic opportunities without the Internet? What options do you have for post-secondary education?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>ROADS</p>
<p>There aren't many roads. Not outside Iqaluit, anyway.</p>
<p>Proposals have been put forward to build a network connecting Nunavut's communities, which would provide an alternative to the astronomical cost of air travel. But it's a trade-off, says Rob Huebert, associate director for the Centre for Military and Strategic Studies at the University of Calgary.</p>
<p>“There is always the concern that if you do build a complete road system you will be impacting on the ecological system,” he says. “You have to balance: Do you keep it preserved as it is? … [But] most of the people I talk to talk about having some form of connection to Southern Canada.”</p>
<p>Proposals have been put forward for road connections through Manitoba, Ontario or Quebec. But the most high-profile has been the Bathurst Inlet Road and Port project, a multimillion-dollar proposal to build a port and road in the far northwest corner of Nunavut. Its proponents insist the 211-kilometre road and port are vital to mining development in the territory.</p>
<p>The plan has encountered strident opposition from environmentalists opposed to development that would harm wildlife habitat in the Kitikmeot and Bathurst Inlet area. They are specifically concerned about the Porcupine caribou, which migrate through the region.</p>
<p>But Charlie Lyall, president of the Inuit-owned Kitikmeot Corporation backing the proposal, argues that by making it cheaper to supply mine sites and to ship minerals out by boat, the project will bring jobs and economic growth to the region.</p>
<p>“A lot of the people that are living on social assistance right now would be able to work. … The young people that are graduating now, right now there's really nothing for them at the end of the tunnel. And this would be an opportunity for them.”</p>

<p>Re: H1N1 vaccine safety, efficacy questioned, Aug. 7.</p>
<p>Canadians should be informed with facts about Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate).</p>
<p>Tamiflu is an oral antiviral medication recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment and prevention of an influenza pandemic.</p>
<p>According to the WHO, during a pandemic, antivirals have a significant beneficial impact in reducing morbidity and mortality. Recent clinical trials of Tamiflu for the prophylaxis of influenza have demonstrated an efficacy relative to placebo of 76-92 per cent.</p>
<p>In adult treatment studies with Tamiflu the most frequently reported adverse events were nausea and vomiting. It is important that health care professionals and patients know that all patients with flu should be monitored, regardless of whether they are taking an antiviral medication. If any signs of unusual behaviour are observed, a health care professional should be contacted immediately.</p>
<p>Tamiflu has been used by more than 48 million people worldwide, including nearly 21 million children, since its approval in 1999.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>What if zombies took over world? It would be disastrous: Math profs; Canadian academics model such a scenario in research paper</b>
</div><div>David Wylie </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>472 words</div><div>16 August 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>F28</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province </div>
</p>
<p>A team of Canadian mathematicians have been picking their large, delectable brains over whether humankind could survive a zombie apocalypse.</p>
<p>Their conclusion?</p>
<p>"An outbreak of zombies infecting humans is likely to be disastrous, unless extremely aggressive tactics are employed against the undead," says the paper, titled When Zombies Attack! Mathematical Modelling of an Outbreak of Zombie Infection.</p>
<p>"Thus, if zombies arrive, we must act quickly and decisively to eradicate them before they eradicate us."</p>
<p>Of course, the researchers -- all mathematicians from Carleton University in Ontario and the University of Ottawa -- took their undead, flesh-eating topic with a large pinch of salt.</p>
<p>"If you look at it in a more realistic way, zombies are about the same as any other major infectious disease -- they get out and we try to eliminate them," said Joe Imad, a University of Ottawa mathematics student and one of the paper's co-authors.</p>
<p>"Modelling zombies would be the same as modelling swine flu, with some differences for sure, but it is much more interesting to read."</p>
<p>Imad, Philip Munz, Ioan Hudea and Robert J. Smith, an assistant University of Ottawa math professor, researched zombies for several months.</p>
<p>They used mathematical equations to map several types of outbreak, including a basic model where everyone becomes infected, a scenario where the outbreak was quarantined and a situation where a cure was developed.</p>
<p>They defined zombies as "a reanimated human corpse that feeds on living human flesh."</p>
<p>The study is part of a book titled Infectious Disease Modelling Research Progress from Nova Publishers.</p>
<p>It's sandwiched between Chapter 3, about drug treatment of patients with both tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, and Chapter 5, the mathematical modelling of the epidemiology of malaria.</p>
<p>The paper's bibliography included such sources as Compartmental Models in</p>
<p>Epidemiology and the 1968 film Night of the Living Dead.</p>
<p>As outlandish as the subject may seem, the researchers say there is a real-life application.</p>
<p>"This is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the first mathematical analysis of an outbreak of zombie infection," says the paper.</p>
<p>"While the scenarios considered are obviously not realistic, it is nevertheless instructive to develop mathematical models for an unusual outbreak. This demonstrates the flexibility of mathematical modelling and shows how modelling can respond to a wide variety of challenges in 'biology.'"</p>
<p>Imad said he and his colleagues received a "pretty good" grade on the project.</p>

</p>
<p>Experts suggest dogs have the mental capacity of your average two-year-old human. But do you know any two-year-olds who can take the subway by themselves and get off at the right stop?</p>
<p>In Moscow, stray dogs travel the subway from the suburbs to the city centre every morning in search of food, then return to their canine homes at night.</p>
<p>Biology professor Andrew Poyarkov says he has watched several of the unaccompanied dogs travelling on Moscow's underground rail system.</p>
<p>"They do not just go to the subway station, they actually board the trains," he said. "They seem to have learned how long they need to stay on the train to leave at the right station."</p>
<p>Of course, sometimes the dogs, being dogs after all, fall asleep on the train and miss their stop, reports Cape Town's Independent newspaper. "But then they get off and take another train back to the centre," says Poyarkov. The professor adds he has also seen these same dogs waiting at a green light to cross the road. He intends to continue studying the animals to discover what other human traits they pick up.</p>
<p>Obviously they've already figured out how to dodge paying the fare.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Cica the guard dog proved malice in your bark can be just important as teeth in your bite when she chased off a robber. Cica, you should know, is a six-inch-high Yorkshire terrier.</p>
<p>According to ananova.com,the bandit was rifling through the tills at gunpoint at a post office in Modling, Austria, when he mistakenly awoke the dog, who was napping in her basket under the counter.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the Yorkie leaped to her feet and started yapping. The startled robber put down his gun and fled.</p>
<p>Revenge served stuffed</p>
<p>Are you a not-so-wise guy?A dumbfella? Then a plush-toy horse's head may be the perfect sleep accessory for you.</p>
<p>Available from kropserkel.com,this bedroom accessory is darkly reminiscent of that scene from The Godfather where the movie producer wakes up to find the head of his prize stallion in his bed.</p>
<p>This head, however, makes an ideal pillow or cuddle toy. No longer will your enemies have to sleep with the fishes when they could snuggle up next to a plush horse's head instead.</p>

<p>In other news from the animal kingdom, one of Miami Beach's most prominent celebrities has been evicted from his condo--because he's a chicken.</p>
<p>Neighbours were complaining Mr. Clucky was crowing at all hours of the night, a charge denied by the bird's owner, Mark Buckley. Nevertheless, the chicken has to go, as well as his live-in girlfriend, Wallflower.</p>
<p>Mr. Clucky is a familiar figure in the South Beach area of Miami Beach, riding on the handlebars of Buckley's bicycle and serving as grand marshal of a local parade. But, reports the Miami Herald, civic codes in Miami Beach prohibit the keeping of livestock, even of the celebrity variety.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a bunch of rabbis in Israel have opened up a new battlefront in the war against swine flu.</p>
<p>About 50 of the Jewish holy men--a group that included a few Kabbalah mystics--climbed aboard an aircraft that circled over the tiny country as they chanted prayers and blew horns, called "shofars," reports the BBC.</p>
<p>Rabbi Yitzhak Batzri told the Jewish daily Yedioth Ahnronoth the goal of the airborne prayer-making and horn-blowing was to stop the swine flu pandemic in its tracks. More than 2,000 Israelis have been afflicted with the virus.</p>

<p>Telescope has been diligent over the years in reporting on the damage inflicted on automobiles by animals falling from great heights, and it is in that spirit we share with you the news that a car windshield in Ohio was smashed by a falling fish.</p>
<p>A woman was driving in Marblehead-- which as everyone knows is on Route 163 between Danbury and Lakeside--when the five-pound fish fell from the mouth of an eagle flying 12 metres overhead. With that weight, we'd have guessed it was a Lake Erie pickerel, but according to the Sandusky Register, it was a sheepshead.</p>
<p>The woman, Leighann Niles, was unharmed, though she said the strike felt like a brick had gone through her window. No word on how the fish fared.</p>
<p>Judge not</p>
<p>A judge in Maryland has admitted he let the air out of a tire on a car that was parked illegally near the courthouse--but he's not sorry he did.</p>
<p>Charles County Judge Robert C. Nalley said leaving notes on illegally parked vehicles wasn't proving very effective.</p>
<p>According to the Washington Post, the car belonged to Jean Washington, a part-time member of the cleaning crew at the courthouse. Washington said she was not aware she was parking in a restricted area.</p>

</p>
<p>A woman who died Friday after contracting the H1N1 virus awoke only once from a medically induced coma after the birth of her son in June, asking weakly for "my baby," according to a friend.</p>
<p>Fatiha Idrissi Kaitouni, 23, died Friday at Sacré Coeur Hospital, more than two months after being hospitalized for a high fever while in the final months of her pregnancy. After suffering severe respiratory problems, she was given a C-section and her son was born.</p>
<p>Baby Yassine was reportedly healthy after some initial breathing problems.</p>
<p>Hajar Rougui, a good friend of Kaitouni, told La Presse the woman was put in an induced coma following the</p>
<p>C-section and she hemorrhaged badly.</p>
<p>"She was losing 1.8 litres of blood per hour," Rougui was quoted as saying. "She was being given 34 bags of blood per day."</p>
<p>Kaitouni never really regained consciousness, Rougui said, and woke just once to say "my baby, my baby."</p>
<p>Sacré Coeur officials were not available yesterday to comment on the exact cause of Kaitouni's death.</p>
<p>Marie-Ève Bédard, a spokesperson for Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc, said people can die only from complications from H1N1, not from the virus itself. She was not sure exactly how the woman died.</p>
<p>According to another media report, Kaitouni had been a daycare worker.</p>
<p>Daycare workers become eligible for medical leave as soon as they know they are pregnant, said Alexandra Reny, a spokesperson for the Commission de la santé et de la sécurité du travail.</p>
<p>Reny did not know how many women in the daycare field have been granted medical leave because of H1N1.</p>
<p>It was not known when Kaitouni last worked in a daycare. Kaitouni's family could not be reached yesterday.</p>
<p>The woman reportedly came to Canada from Morocco to join her husband a year ago. Described by a friend as "a ball of joy" who was always smiling, Kaitouni had hoped to have four or five children and live in a big house.</p>

</div><div>ANDREW HALFNIGHT, AND MAX HARROLD   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>686 words</div><div>16 August 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Quebec schools are bracing for a second wave of swine flu as the onset of flu season - the cold and dry months when the incidence of influenza rises tenfold - coincides with back-to-school time.</p>
<p>But at least one Montreal area school board is not planning to follow the example of two Quebec City boards that have announced pregnant teachers will be kept at home because of the flu threat.</p>
<p>Instead, the Lester B. Pearson board in the West Island says it will wait for cues from the Quebec government.</p>
<p>"We'll see if there are any new directives from either the ministry of education or public health officials," chairperson Marcus Tabachnick told The Gazette yesterday.</p>
<p>Marie-Ève Bédard, a spokesperson for Health Minister Yves Bolduc, said a policy announcement on H1N1 will be made on Aug. 24.</p>
<p>However, the government will not instruct at-risk groups - including pregnant women, the elderly and those with suppressed immune systems - to stay away from schools and hospitals, she said. Instead, it will remind them of the inherent dangers.</p>
<p>"The policy will leave the door open for institutions that may want to take additional precautions," Bédard said.</p>
<p>All pregnant workers in Quebec can request to be reassigned or go on medical leave if they believe their job may expose them to contracting H1N1 or other illnesses, according to Alexandra Reny, a spokesperson for the Commission de la santé et de la sécurité du travail, the province's workplace compensation board.</p>
<p>With the approval of a doctor, workers can be granted leave during their pregnancies with 90 per cent of their salary covered by the CSST.</p>
<p>If a woman's physician does not agree there is a risk, the matter is referred to doctors at regional health agencies who make the final decision, Reny explained.</p>
<p>Health care workers regularly obtain reassignment or leaves, Reny said. Twenty pregnant women in health care jobs have obtained medical leaves because of fears about H1N1 since May, she said. Daycare workers are automatically eligible for medical leave as soon as they become pregnant, Reny said.</p>
<p>Education workers have no such automatic protection. "That's really a case-by-case thing," Reny said.</p>
<p>The Quebec City school boards' decisions were taken on Friday - the same day that a young Montreal woman died of swine flu complications following the birth of her son. The woman, Fatiha Idrissi Kaitouni, contracted the disease while pregnant.</p>
<p>Officials say pregnant women are more likely to develop complications from swine flu. A study published in this month's Lancet medical journal found pregnant women four times more likely to need hospital treatment after contracting H1N1.</p>
<p>So far, the province's public health authority and its federation of school boards have balked at implementing the the same preventive measure province-wide.</p>
<p>"In Quebec, each school board is responsible for its own action plan," Caroline Lemieux, a spokesperson for the Fédération des commissions scolaires du Québec, told The Gazette.</p>
<p>"We believe everyone will be prepared," Lemieux said. "There are committees dealing with this at every board. They've been preparing since 2006."</p>
<p>That year, the Quebec government established a "chain of communication" intended to ensure the upkeep of public services in the event of a pandemic.</p>
<p>In 2007, the education department adopted an action plan that says schools are expected to remain open during a pandemic unless "exceptionally" serious hand-to-hand spreading occurs.</p>
<p>The 35-page action plan does not mention the higher risk to pregnant women.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tabachnick's school board will do what it did in the spring: send out a recorded phone message to 32,000 parents and staff, reminding them to wash their hands, watch for symptoms like coughing and fever, and avoid hand-to-hand contact.</p>
<p>"It's not a matter of panicking," he said. "It's a matter of making sure you have all the information."</p>

</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz pledged $92 million for Canada's ailing hog industry yesterday, money aimed at helping pork producers get out of the business and farms restructure to become profitable again.</p>
<p>"Some operations simply aren't viable anymore, and we are going to help them transition out of the industry and reduce production," Ritz said in a statement following his announcement in Winnipeg. "Some operations need access to credit to weather the current economic storm and we are providing government-backed loans to help them restructure."</p>
<p>The minister said hog farmers need to face the "tough realities" that Canadian supply exceeds demand.</p>
<p>A total of $75 million will be set aside to allow pork farmers to cease their operations for at least three years, enabling the industry to reduce its overall production.</p>
<p>The remaining $17 million will be set aside for market research and promotion of pork products in Canada, said Ritz.</p>
<p>The government will also back long- and short-term loans for those in the hog industry to use to restructure their businesses. The loans will be offered at market rates.</p>
<p>"We're standing with Canadian pork producers as they restructure and streamline the industry to adjust to new market realities," said National Revenue Minister Jean-Pierre Blackburn in a statement. "These investments will rebuild the Canadian pork industry for the long term."</p>
<p>This year, the country's pork producers faced declining profits not seen in 60 years, compounded by high feed prices, export bans and fears sparked by the H1N1 swine flu outbreak.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hospitals stockpile flu drugs for staff; One-third of Ontario facilities, including the GTA's, have antivirals to protect workers during outbreak</b>
</div><div>Theresa Boyle and Dan Robson </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>667 words</div><div>15 August 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star </div>
</p>
<p>A third of Ontario's 157 hospitals - including most in the Greater Toronto Area - have purchased antiviral medication to protect staff from getting ill if there is a resurgence of swine flu this fall.</p>
<p>While the move has left some wondering why other hospitals aren't doing the same, others question whether health-care workers are at any greater risk.</p>
<p>Hospitals that bought the drugs hope to curb absenteeism if they're swamped with H1N1 patients.</p>
<p>"We need enough staff to operate, so the concern is that even in a mild pandemic so many people are sick that you lose a very large percentage of your staff," said Gillian Howard, spokeswoman for University Health Network, which includes Toronto General, Toronto Western and Princess Margaret hospitals.</p>
<p>"Our thought was we could purchase and hope - because there is an element of insurance here - that we could prophylax our staff and get through till such a time that a vaccine became available."</p>
<p>Though not foolproof, antivirals such as Tamiflu can be used to treat individuals suffering from H1N1 as well as help prevent the illness in the first place. The latter practice is known as "prophylaxis."</p>
<p>The province has bought enough antivirals to treat up to 25 per cent of Ontarians, but it has not bought any for preventive purposes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many private businesses, including law firms and banks, have purchased their own stockpiles to help prevent "mission critical" employees from getting sick during a pandemic.</p>
<p>The federal and provincial governments do not recommend hospitals purchase the drugs, although governments in the United States and some European countries do.</p>
<p>Doris Grinspun, executive director of the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario, said the situation creates an inequity for which the province should be held to account. "You can't send soldiers to war and not protect them," she said.</p>
<p>But Dr. Neil Rau, infectious disease specialist for Halton Hills Healthcare Services, said stockpiling antivirals for preventive purposes is unnecessary. It's better to reserve them for those who are ill, he said. "Once you're dealing with a very mild disease for most people, the risk benefit of giving everybody preventative treatment is somewhat lost, because when somebody who is really sick needs the treatment, you lose this from your arsenal. That's why the (province) has not been recommending that this drug be used in an AK-47 fashion."</p>
<p>Rau is skeptical about whether hospital workers are at greater risk of catching H1N1: "Once a disease becomes community borne, there is not much of a risk difference between a health-care worker and someone in the community."</p>
<p>The Ontario Hospital Association has not advocated hospitals stockpile antivirals for staff, maintaining that sufficient provisions, such as protective gear, are already in place.</p>
<p>The first hospitals to purchase antivirals were 12 in Toronto, including nine University of Toronto teaching hospitals. They made the decision three years ago, after the 2003 SARS outbreak. "The thing that Toronto has that probably a lot of other areas don't have is that we went through SARS ... If the expectation is that we will continue to be open and running, what do we need to do that?" Howard asked.</p>
<p>The purchase cost for the University Health Network alone was $1 million. It has enough antiviral medication to give each of its approximately 15,000 employees one pill a day for eight weeks.</p>
<p>Howard said any decision to give staff antivirals for preventive purposes would be made in tandem by the Toronto-area hospitals.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious disease prevention at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, said about 40 other Ontario hospitals have since stockpiled antiviral medication for staff. "If you want health-care workers to be there for you during a pandemic, they can't be off sick."</p>

<p>MONTREAL</p>
<p>While classrooms may be a breeding ground for germs, at least one doctor says a decision by two Quebec school boards to keep pregnant teachers at home this fall because of swine flu may be premature.</p>
<p>Reports on Friday that the Quebec City school boards planned to take such drastic preventive measures came on the same day a Montreal woman died of swine flu complications after she contracted the virus while pregnant.</p>
<p>Fatiha Idrissi Kaitouni gave birth to a baby boy by caesarean section in June but had been on life support in a Montreal hospital ever since.</p>
<p>Dominique Breton, a spokesperson with Quebec's Health Department, said the 23-year-old developed cardiopulmonary difficulties and pneumonia as a result of the virus and died Friday.</p>
<p>Her husband, Mohamed Hassani Idrissi, told media his wife contracted the virus while pregnant, during which time she suffered serious breathing problems and lost a lot of blood.</p>
<p>Dr. Gaston De Serres, an epidemiologist with Quebec's public health institute, said such cases are rare. But while pregnant women are at no greater risk to contract the virus, they are at greater risk for complications.</p>
<p>"The number of deaths due to H1N1 in Canada is still fairly limited and to have pregnant women among them suggests that pregnancy is a risk factor for severe outcome," he said.</p>
<p>As for the decision by the two school boards, De Serres seemed a little torn.</p>
<p>"If a woman is pregnant and asks me, ‘Should I go to an environment where there is lots of transmission?', I guess the answer is pretty self-explicit," he said.</p>
<p>"Going to an environment where lots of viruses are circulating will be dangerous."</p>
<p>That said, De Serres cautioned against making decisions that are not "substantiated by the risks."</p>
<p>He said keeping pregnant teachers out of school may be something to consider in an outbreak situation but at the moment it's not clear whether the virus will pick up in the fall or in January when influenza season typically begins.</p>
<p>"If this question is asked during a period of real increase of influenza, I guess that the decision will be taken not only by school boards, but also by ministers of health and unions and all those people involved in health issues," he said.</p>
<p>The key for pregnant women, he added, is seeking medical attention early.</p>
<p>"The antiviral treatments that exist are much more effective if given in the first 48 hours of disease onset," he said.</p>
<p>Neither of the school boards could be reached for comment.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia Eagles will be a good fit for quarterback Michael Vick, who signed with the NFL team on Thursday. After all, a guy who spent 18 months in prison ought to feel comfortable in Pen-sylvania ... Many folks are wondering what the arrival of Vick will mean for Eagles starting quarterback Donovan McNabb. One thing's for sure: The competition for the No. 1 job will not be described as a dogfight ... An interesting battle to watch during Eagles camp: Vick against Mike Wolf, the team's strength and conditioning coach ... Here's the headline that appeared on the story of Vick's signing in The Trentonian of Trenton, N.J.: "Hide your beagle, Vick is an Eagle."</p>
<p>Tennessee Titans running back LenDale White told the media he lost 30 pounds over the off-season just by giving up tequila. Added Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle: "But now White isn't sure whether he actually lost weight or suddenly was able to read the scale correctly." ... The Miami Dolphins have a new version of their fight song, courtesy of rapper T-Pain. "The familiar original, of course, begins, 'Miami has the Dolphins, the greatest football team ...' '' noted Greg Cote of the Miami Herald. "Cannot confirm the rap version starts, 'Yo, Miami has the (bleep) Dolphins, the greatest (bleep-bleep) football team, Shorty. (Bleep).' ''</p>
<p>Former Moose Jaw Warriors star Theoren Fleury is looking to make a hockey comeback. Great. First Claude Lemieux and now Fleury. Who's next, Reggie Dunlop? (That one will be particularly impressive) ... Chicago Blackhawks star Patrick Kane is to find out next week if a grand jury thinks criminal charges should be pursued against him for punching a Buffalo cab driver. Kane and his cousin allegedly smacked the cabbie because he didn't have 20 cents in change he owed them on their fare. Watch for punches to be thrown next season when someone tells Kane it's time to "change on the fly" ... And what will happen the next time The Score's Cabbie ventures into the Blackhawks' dressing room?</p>
<p>The Seattle Mariners have placed third baseman Adrian Beltre on the 15-day disabled list with a damaged right testicle. He suffered the injury during Wednesday's game against the White Sox when a ground ball off the bat of Chicago's Alexei Ramirez hit Beltre in the, uh, third-base bag. Like his young team, Beltre is now suffering groin pains ... Beltre doesn't wear a cup, which is plain nuts ... Pete Rose continues to twist in the wind when it comes to baseball's Hall of Fame. "If I were a betting man, I'd say Rose eventually gets in," wrote Reggie Hayes of the Fort Wayne News-Sentinel. "And if Rose weren't a betting man, he'd already be in." ... Former Toronto Blue Jays first baseman John Olerud believes his glacier-like speed helped him hit 54 doubles in 1993. As he told the Toronto Sun this week: "Some were triples."</p>
<p>This week's wacky soccer story comes from Mexico City, where a couple of fans reportedly hurled their own vomit and urine at American Landon Donovan as he prepared to take a corner kick during Wednesday's World Cup qualifier. So that's why everybody describes soccer as a fluid game! ... Donovan told SI.com on Thursday that he has tested positive for the H1N1 flu. If he's still ticked at L.A. Galaxy teammate David Beckham, a good handshake ought to do the trick ... British boxer Rob Newbiggin, 44, hopes to continue his career after he undergoes a sex change operation. Apparently, Newbiggin -- who owns a 3-12 career record -- thinks he can earn more as a female boxer. Added Brad Dickson of the Omaha World-Herald: "If it works out, brace yourself for aging heavyweight Eleanor Holyfield." ... The last word this week goes to freestyle motocross rider Brian Deegan, who told the New York Times that he -- like more and more X Gamers -- has found the Lord. Noted Deegan: "I wouldn't say our whole team has been saved. We still have our punk rebel dudes that sin, but I'm not going to judge."</p>

</p>
<p>As part of its H1N1 pandemic plan, the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region is ordering extra medical supplies -- ranging from rubber gloves to body bags.</p>
<p>Normally, in a 12-week period, hospitals use 350 of what the region refers to as post-mortem bags. They're planning to have 500 on hand this fall.</p>
<p>"We have a list, along with our pandemic plan, of medical supplies that we've ordered that includes post-mortem bags, but it also includes IV solutions, respiratory supplies, such as oxygen masks, and tape -- basic medical supplies that we use all the time," said region spokeswoman Lori Foster.</p>
<p>"We've ordered extra supplies because we might have difficulty getting them during a pandemic if a number of people are sick.</p>
<p>"These lists are part of the emergency preparedness that we do all of the time."</p>
<p>As of July 22, Saskatchewan has recorded four deaths associated with the H1N1 influenza virus: a woman in her 40s, a man in his 70s, a child under ten years of age, and a woman in her 50s.</p>
<p>All had serious underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>Health officials cannot predict exactly if or when the next wave of the pandemic will occur, or its severity, but for planning purposes they estimate that 15 to 35 per cent of Saskatchewan's residents would become ill during the two-to-three month period it would take for the pandemic influenza to spread.</p>
<p>According to Saskatchewan Health's web site: "In this scenario, it is estimated that the number of people in Saskatchewan who may require hospitalization could range from 1,000 to 2,800, and 300 to 1,000 may die from influenza or complications of influenza."</p>
<p>In a typical year, 4,000 Canadians will die from seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>To help Canadians prepare for a possible H1N1 pandemic, fact sheets and check lists for individuals and families, communities and businesses are available on the Public Health Agency of Canada website (www.phac-aspc.gc.ca[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca]).</p>

<p>About 4,300 executives have descended on Toronto today for what is nicknamed the Super Bowl of conventions – a ray of sunshine for tourism officials facing one of the grimmest industry downturns in recent memory.</p>
<p>The four-day American Society of Association Executives convention, booked long before the global economic crisis, is a conference and expo for leaders who themselves book the annual conventions so crucial to the city's tourism business.</p>
<p>“It's a live audition for Toronto,” said Andrew Weir, vice-president of communications for Tourism Toronto, which aims to add sizzle to its bid for new business by treating delegates to a private, closing-night concert by Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings.</p>
<p>Tourism in the GTA, like in the rest of Canada and beyond, has been upended by the global recession, cuts to corporate travel and H1N1 flu fears. Toronto's municipal workers strike, a cool start to summer, and Ottawa's sudden visa requirement for visitors from Mexico have only aggravated the downturn, officials said.</p>
<p>Year over year tourism indicators, such as visitor arrivals and hotel occupancy rates, paint a startling picture:</p>
<p>• Trips by Asians to Canada fell 24 per cent in May, the beginning of the peak tourism season, while European visits dropped 15.9 per cent, Statistics Canada reports. From January to May, total visits by residents of countries other than the United States are down 10.5 per cent from 2008.</p>
<p>• American visits to Canada by plane dropped 12 per cent in the first five months of 2009, although visits by car are virtually unchanged. In Ontario, U.S. arrivals by car actually increased 4.2 per cent.</p>
<p>• Hotel occupancy and the average room rate in Toronto were down 10 per cent for the first six months of the year.</p>
<p>Terry Mundell, president and CEO of the Greater Toronto Hotel Association, said May and June were “terrible” months for local bookings. Although July was better, “it's still a very volatile marketplace,” he said.</p>
<p>The recession has “fundamentally changed the way people travel,” added Mr. Weir of Tourism Toronto, an industry-funded visitor and convention bureau. “It has changed leisure travel, the way people are spending their disposable income, it's changed business and convention travel.”</p>
<p>Business meetings are still happening, but they may be shorter or have fewer participants, he said.</p>
<p>“There's a lot of hurt in the industry right now,” said Randy Williams, president and CEO of the Tourism Industry Association of Canada, noting that many conventions have seen delegate attendance fall by as much as 20 per cent.</p>
<p>Mr. Williams praised the federal government's tourism stimulus programs, but he urged Ottawa to reintroduce the visitor GST rebate program, invest in high-speed rail and make Canadian airlines more competitive by cutting down on excess fees and taxes. He said more needs to be done to get Canada “approved destination status” with China, which would make it easier for the world's largest outbound tourist population to visit.</p>
<p>TIAC predicts the industry will shrink by 5 to 8 per cent by year's end, a loss of more than $4-billion in revenues. It would be the steepest decline and only the third year of negative growth in the last 25 years, its president said.</p>
<p>Mr. Weir said conventions like the one this weekend in Toronto are also key to the recovery. The 11 major conventions booked in Toronto for 2009 will result in $400-million in direct spending, he said.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Science is still struggling with how to get the jump on swine flu, but Canadians can take heart that a group of Ottawa mathematicians have found the key to beating a more virulent, if only cinematic, threat.</p>
<p>A zombie outbreak – the kind that always confounds authorities in movies – can be successfully overcome through “quick, aggressive attacks” on the undead, scholars at the University of Ottawa and Carleton University have concluded.</p>
<p>“While aggressive quarantine may contain the epidemic, or a cure may lead to the co-existence of humans and zombies, the most effective way to contain the rise of the undead is to hit hard and hit often,” the mathematicians say in a playful research paper, When Zombies Attack!: Mathematical Modelling of an Outbreak Of Zombie Infection, which is being published as part of a book due out later this year from Nova Science Publishers.</p>
<p>Those behind the paper include students as well as assistant University of Ottawa math professor Robert J. Smith, who receives support from a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada grant and the Ontario Early Researcher Award program.</p>
<p>The work is not a case of math geeks just cracking jokes. It's a display of the rigorous math, statistics and models used to analyze infection rates of real-life diseases and to demonstrate how a virus spreads through a population.</p>
<p>Ioan Hudea, a Carleton student who helped author the zombie paper, said this mathematical modelling is used to help authorities prepare for outbreaks.</p>
<p>“You're using this sort of model to predict the outcome of epidemics and know how to vaccinate people, how much vaccine is needed and how to assemble a vaccination plan.”</p>
<p>One problem the researchers had in modelling zombie attacks is that popular culture has yielded two different types of undead, the second of which can potentially infect people faster. The slow-moving, mindless variety was made famous by the classic 1968 thriller Night of the Living Dead, while the smarter, faster and more independent type have cropped up in more recent films such as 28 Days Later and the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead.</p>
<p>In the end, the faster, brainier zombies didn't make the cut when it came to modelling.</p>
<p>The mathematicians considered a scenario in which there was rapid “zombification” after people were bitten by undead creatures, and another in which the incubation period was 24 hours. Both ended badly for the human race. “In this [second] case, the zombies take over, but it takes approximately twice as long.”</p>
<p>They considered quarantining the zombies where possible. This didn't avert catastrophe either, even if captured zombies were destroyed.</p>
<p>Finally, they studied the impact of a cure that restored the humanity of the infected, but didn't grant people immunity. In this case, some humans survived, but only in low numbers.</p>
<p>The only solution that worked was rapid destruction of zombies – the same lesson conveyed by Hollywood.</p>
<p>“As seen in the movies, it is imperative that zombies are dealt with quickly, or else we are all in a great deal of trouble,” the mathematicians said.</p>
<p>The key difference in modelling zombies, as opposed to real infectious diseases, is that the dead can return to life, the mathematicians noted. “Clearly, this is an unlikely scenario if taken literally, but possible real-life applications may include allegiance to political parties or diseases with a dormant infection.”</p>

<div>VIRTUAL WORLD WAKE-UP CALL</div>
<div>Comment Column</div>
<div id="hd"><b>For God's sake, get a Second Life (or not); If you're feeling a little obsolete, it's probably time for an avatar</b>

<p>Do you have an avatar? Do you even know what an avatar is? If not, you've got a problem. You're in danger of becoming as out of touch as your great-aunt Millie – the one who never quite got the hang of e-mail.</p>
<p>Lois King has an avatar. Her avatar is a tall, shapely blonde who lives in a virtual world called Second Life. She wears a snappy business suit, which is appropriate because she teaches serious courses in finance at York University in Toronto. She teaches traditional classroom courses, as well as distance courses on the Internet.</p>
<p>“I think this technology has amazing implications,” she says. She plans to use her avatar to conduct virtual meetings and tutorials with her students, who'll be able to send their own avatars to her virtual office in cyberspace. It's a practical way to meet if face to face is impossible or inconvenient. “My students will love it.” She even has a virtual lecture hall, which is designed to look like her real one. One day, she might use it to give lectures without ever leaving home.</p>
<p>Are you feeling left behind? Me, too.</p>
<p>It's starting to dawn on me that auto workers aren't the only people threatened with obsolescence. So-called knowledge workers are vulnerable, too. If the definition of literacy is the ability to function in current technologies, then a lot of us are going to have to head back to school.</p>
<p>But the school of tomorrow could be a lot different from the one you went to.</p>
<p>Like other universities, York has acquired a piece of real estate on Second Life, where it has started to build a virtual campus. Second Life is a virtual Internet world with 3-D environments, where people interact through online characters they create called avatars. They communicate with each other in real time using either text or voice.</p>
<p>Second Life is mainly used for recreation (virtual sex is quite popular), but people have begun to experiment with it for education and even business. York professor Ali Asgary, who created York's site, uses it for his courses in emergency management, because he can simulate real disasters in real time as his students role-play and problem-solve. One scenario he's used is last year's massive propane explosion in Toronto. In another exercise, he brought together an international group of experts to tackle a simulated swine-flu epidemic. “In the real world, it would take six months to organize. We did it in one.”</p>
<p>At Loyalist College in Belleville, Ont., instructors use a virtual border crossing to train border agents. Harvard Law School has built a courtroom on Second Life and held mock trials there. Corporations use it to hold international meetings or recruit staff.</p>
<p>Maybe this is just a fad. Or maybe it's a glimpse into the future. Membership in virtual worlds is growing fast, and has reached more than half a billion. Kids today are as comfortable in virtual worlds as they are in the real one. “Girls used to grow up with their dolls,” writes British commentator Victor Keegan. “Now they are growing up with their avatars.” Lois King says, “My seven-year-old gets it instantly.”</p>
<p>I confess that all these avatars strike me as a little silly. But people report that having an embodied presence in the virtual world makes the experience extremely engaging. The visual environment creates an immediacy that's far more effective – and a lot cheaper – than teleconferencing. Avatars allow people in many different places to interact as if they really were together.</p>
<p>While e-mail and Twitter are strictly two-way, Second Life and other virtual worlds allow many people to communicate simultaneously. The navigation and graphics are still clumsy and cartoonish. But the technology is cheap. And it can transcend the barriers of bricks, mortar and space.</p>
<p>“Let's see what's going on in Innsbruck,” says Ms. King. With one mouse click, she teleports her avatar to a virtual campus created by a university in Innsbruck, where a Swiss professor is giving a real-time lecture on the environment. The audience includes a flamboyant, busty redhead and a large green creature that looks like an alligator. Ali Asgary's avatar is there, too – a friendly looking little guy in a T-shirt. “It's good to make your avatar look pretty much like you,” he says later.</p>
<p>Is traditional teaching on the way out? Prof. Asgary thinks so. “It has to change, because new generations are coming in with a different system of learning.” They're collaborative and hyper-interactive. They're more attached to their cellphones than to their arms. They text each other a thousand times a week.</p>
<p>Some people are predicting that, before long, most of us will be spending part of our lives in the virtual world. We could go on a 3-D Web the way we go online today. (Even now, relationship counsellors are grappling with such existential questions as: If my partner's avatar has sex with someone else's avatar, is that infidelity?)</p>
<p>If you're a serious futurist, it's not hard to imagine a time when universities (and even newsrooms, if they still exist) will be mostly virtual. After all, real estate is cheaper in cyberspace. “It's very cost-effective,” says Ms. King.</p>
<p>Meantime, she admits she's still struggling to find her way around on Second Life. She hasn't mastered the controls quite yet, and her avatar often walks into walls or falls out of the sky. (Avatars can fly.) “It's going to take a few more weeks before I really get the hang of it,” she says. Splat! Her avatar bites the dust.</p>
<p>I'm thinking there may be hope for me yet. I'm thinking that, if I have to get an avatar, I can make her look like Helen Mirren.</p>

<p>MONTREAL -- A young mother described as a “ball of joy” died yesterday in Montreal after contracting the H1N1 virus, leaving behind a baby boy she never lived to see.</p>
<p>Fatiha Idrissi Kaitouni was taken to hospital in early June complaining of a sore throat and fever. She was two weeks away from giving birth to her first child.</p>
<p>Within days, the 23-year-old woman developed pneumonia and was rushed to another hospital, where doctors delivered her baby by emergency cesarean section.</p>
<p>The baby, Yasinne, survived and is healthy. But his mother's condition plummeted. She was placed on life support to assist her breathing and, yesterday, died without regaining consciousness or holding her son in her arms.</p>
<p>“I feel great sorrow. My wife never got to see her baby,” Mohamed Hassani Idrissi said in an interview from the couple's apartment. “My wife was a wonderful young woman. I think of my son, who is like an orphan without his mother.”</p>
<p>Ms. Idrissi Kaitouni was a child-care worker who loved children and had a perpetual smile on her face, her family said.</p>
<p>“She was a little ball of joy … she loved life,” said a relative, Ghita Benchekroun. “She wanted to have four, five kids and live in a big house. Those were the last wishes she made in the hospital.”</p>
<p>She had arrived from Morocco only a year ago to join her husband and build a life in Canada.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Quebec Health Ministry said Ms. Idrissi Kaitouni was the 24th confirmed death caused by H1N1 in the province. Health officials say pregnant women are no more likely to get the flu, but face a greater risk than the general population of developing complications from it.</p>
<p>“This event reminds us that H1N1 is a severe illness for groups at risk, which include pregnant women,” Dominique Breton said. “The flu can cause serious complications, such as death.”</p>
<p>A study published this month in the British medical journal The Lancet suggests that pregnant women are four times more likely than the general population to need hospital treatment for H1N1 swine flu. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study looked at 34 cases of swine flu among pregnant women; six died after developing pneumonia.</p>
<p>Gaston De Serres, a medical epidemiologist at Laval University in Quebec City, said the risk of complications for women is greater in the second half of their pregnancy. Women with flu symptoms should quickly consult a doctor, as prompt anti-viral treatment is vital.</p>
<p>“The effectiveness depends on the speed with which you start the treatment,” he said.</p>

<p>A young Montreal mother who died of swine flu yesterday never had a chance to hold her newborn son. Fatiha Idrissi, 23, was taken off life support yesterday after contracting H1N1. She had checked into Sacré Coeur Hospital in June. Her husband Hassani Idrissi said doctors did a C-section once the baby started showing signs of respiratory distress. Idrissi's condition deteriorated quickly after the surgery. She died two months later - but was heavily sedated that entire time.</p>

</p>
<p>A recent Spectator editorial about the H1N1 virus made the commonly stated point that once the schools re-open, and the flu season starts, we are likely to see a significant spike in the number of people who catch it. This has been happening already in Australia and around the globe. And as the editorial states: Our best protection, is for us to "... be thorough and frequent in washing our hands and protecting each other from coughing and sneezing. And we should start now, not wait for flu season."</p>
<p>I am currently pregnant and due to deliver in early October. That is after school has started and near the start of flu season. I understand that new babies are at high risk of the more devastating effects of any type of flu.</p>
<p>I also have a young, school-aged child who has the potential to bring home the H1N1 and other flu viruses. Thus, I am deeply concerned about what preventative measures the schools are offering in response to this pandemic.</p>
<p>So far, we have received a letter from the Public Health Department stating that handwashing is the best prevention. However, most of my child's waking hours are not at home, but at school where I cannot monitor handwashing habits. And let's face it -- kids often just forget or are simply in a hurry.</p>
<p>How many people are aware of the handwashing techniques practised at our schools? Certainly I have seen my child's kindergarten teachers suggest that the children wash their hands before eating their snacks. But I'm not sure the teachers watched if each child washed their hands after using the toilet or picked their nose.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that at such a young age, hands, toys, paper -- even scissors(!) go into their mouths -- and are not washed before the next child touches the same item, thus encouraging the spread of germs and viruses. I respect that this is completely normal for the age group and I do not expect any teacher to monitor the kids so much that this would not happen.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>Now that H1N1 has pandemic status, I'd love to see all our schools introduce the use of hand sanitizers. We need to develop a program that says every time a child enters and exits their classroom, hands must be sanitized, in addition to regular hand washing practices. Unlike the handwashing "suggestion" made by a teacher, I am certain the message would have to come from above. It should be mandatory for teachers to check that each student uses sanitizers often and in a responsible manner.</p>
<p>I generally respect dirt. I do not usually discourage my kids from playing in dirt. I am aware of the negative effects of antibacterial sanitizers -- many people believe they do more harm than good.</p>
<p>However, given the high risk to young children and their families -- possibly younger siblings, possibly elderly members -- it seems obvious the schools should be our first line of defence against this virus and one of the first places to introduce preventative measures.</p>
<p>My experience is currently with elementary school and young children, so I'm not sure if the same would apply to secondary schools. However, hospitals cater to all ages and on my rare visits to area hospitals, I have yet to witness anyone NOT using the hand sanitizer when it is available and well-signed at the building entrance.</p>
<p>There is no reason a similar program can't work in our schools.</p>
<p>Hamilton resident Christy Cowan expects her third child in October, just in time for flu season.</p>

<p>McMaster hospital patients in two wards and the emergency department are suffering from a lack of air conditioning in addition to their illnesses.</p>
<p>And nurses are experiencing headaches, nausea and breathing problems because of the heat, says Linda Haslam-Stroud, a Hamilton nurse and president of the Ontario Nurses' Association (ONA).</p>
<p>A family at the ER Thursday night with a cardiac issue said yesterday that when they complained, they were told the heat was worse a week ago because patients were fainting.</p>
<p>The air conditioning is off in the ER and sections 3Y and 4Y because the unit controlling it is shut down for a retrofit as part of an upgrading of all 28 of the hospital's air units, said Alan Olinyk, engineering director for Hamilton Health Sciences, the corporation running the hospital.</p>
<p>But the question on staff members' minds is why the hospital would schedule such work in mid-summer, Haslam-Stroud said.</p>
<p>Olinyk's response is that this current weather snap of high temperatures "is abnormal."</p>
<p>"The unit has been down for several weeks and we've never had any issues," Olinyk said.</p>
<p>Hamilton resident Warren Barton said the heat on 3Y was sweltering on Wednesday when he was visiting a patient.</p>
<p>"Everybody was sweating ... it was pretty damn warm."</p>
<p>The ER was worse a few days earlier, he added.</p>
<p>"The emergency department was really bad because there are so many cubicles."</p>
<p>The ONA yesterday sent the union's occupational health and safety representative to McMaster because nurses are becoming ill, Haslam-Stroud said.</p>
<p>"At the end of the day, (the hospital must) either get the temperature down or close the units."</p>
<p>Haslam-Stroud said temperatures on various parts of 3Y ranged from 26.9 degrees Celsius to 28.6 C on Wednesday at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>The heat is making patients uncomfortable and is making it difficult for nurses to care for them, she said. 3Y's patients include those in isolation with C. difficile, and a suspected H1N1 influenza (swine flu) case requiring nurses to don full protective gear when administering care.</p>
<p>On 4Y, a surgical ward, the temperature has been 30 degrees Celsius at times, causing an asthma attack in one patient, Haslam-Stroud added.</p>
<p>Hospital spokesperson Heather Pullen said the temperature in patient rooms with heavy sunlight exposure yesterday afternoon was 28 C and in the corridor, it was 26 C.</p>
<p>Mary MacLeod, a clinical director at McMaster hospital, said supervisory staff and the hospital's occupational health and safety committee have been working on the problem since Wednesday, conducting temperature checks and bringing in more fans and air conditioners as needed.</p>
<p>They will monitor the situation this weekend and do whatever is needed to make the wards more comfortable, she said.</p>
<p>The retrofit on each air handling unit, including new fans, motors, filters and cooling coils, takes about three to four weeks, said Olinyk.</p>
<p>Work on the units -- each as big as a double garage -- started in November 2007. As one unit is completed, work starts on another. So far, 19 have been completed.</p>
<p>Once all the units are done, McMaster will "probably be the first hospital to install microbial membranes to help eliminate bacteria from our air stream," and their state-of-the-art upgrade will save the hospital $3.5 million a year in energy costs, Olinyk said.</p>

</p>
<p>A team of Canadian mathematicians have been picking their large, delectable brains over whether humankind could survive a zombie apocalypse.</p>
<p>Their conclusion?</p>
<p>"An outbreak of zombies infecting humans is likely to be disastrous, unless extremely aggressive tactics are employed against the undead," says the paper, titled When Zombies Attack! Mathematical Modelling of an Outbreak of Zombie Infection.</p>
<p>"Thus, if zombies arrive, we must act quickly and decisively to eradicate them before they eradicate us."</p>
<p>Of course, the researchers - all mathematics students from Carleton University and the University of Ottawa - took their undead, flesh-eating topic with a large pinch of salt.</p>
<p>"If you look at it in a more realistic way, zombies are about the same as any other major infectious disease - they get out and we try to eliminate them," said Joe Imad, one of the paper's co-authors. "Modelling zombies would be the same as modelling swine flu, with some differences for sure."</p>
<p>Imad, Philip Munz, Ioan Hudea and Robert J. Smith researched zombies for several months. They used mathematical equations to map several types of outbreak, including a basic model where everyone becomes infected, a scenario where the outbreak was quarantined and a situation where a cure was developed.</p>
<p>They defined zombies as "a reanimated human corpse that feeds on living human flesh."</p>

</p>
<p>The North American agriculture industry is again calling for a ban on the label "swine flu" for the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>This will become especially urgent in the fall as the H1NI vaccine begins rolling out, delegates at a conference in Gimli concluded Friday. Officials from the United States, Mexico and Canada attended the three-day Tri-National Agricultural Accord, which ended Friday.</p>
<p>They blamed primarily the media, but also some academics and public health sources, for using the incorrect label "swine flu." They say the mislabelling has resulted in confusion among consumers and has contributed to the collapse of the pork industry.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 flu concerns spur alternate communion plans; Local churches watching situation closely</b>
</div><div>Graeme Morton   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>754 words</div><div>15 August 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Calgary churches are developing action plans in the event the H1N1 flu returns in debilitating force this fall.</p>
<p>Christine Mader, director of liturgy and adult formation for Calgary's Roman Catholic diocese, said local church leaders have discussed potential changes to the way communion would be held in any widespread outb1reak.</p>
<p>"We are in a monitoring mode. We are going to take our direction from the public health officials. And in this day and age of instant communications, we could get the word of any changes in policy out to our churches and people very quickly," said Mader.</p>
<p>Catholics attending mass already have a number of choices when it comes to receiving communion and contact with others during worship, she said.</p>
<p>"There is no requirement that the person receive wine from the cup during communion," said Mader. "And as far as physical contact with others during the sharing of the peace, there are options other than shaking hands. You can simply make eye contact, perhaps bow and smile and share the peace verbally."</p>
<p>Maker said many Catholic churches are already equipped with hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>"We don't want to get people into a fear mode, but of course we're going be vigilant and follow the situation closely," said Mader.</p>
<p>Calgary Anglican Bishop Derek Hoskin has sent a letter of "common-sense suggestions" to parish priests and church members across southern and central Alberta. They include installing hand sanitizers at church entrances or close to the communion area and discouraging intinction, the dipping of bread or wafers into the wine chalice.</p>
<p>"In visiting a number of parishes this summer, I found many of our churches have already acted on preparing for H1N1," said Hoskin.</p>
<p>"In Britain, our leadership has already told churches to withdraw wine from their communions. We're not at that stage in Canada, but we're certainly going to monitor it closely as the flu season approaches."</p>
<p>Hoskin said not shaking hands with fellow worshippers during the sharing of the peace may be tough for some Anglicans to adjust to, but that the gravity of any widespread flu pandemic will make such caution second nature.</p>
<p>"To undertake these simple acts will be an expression of your love for your neighbour even as you love yourself," Hoskin says in his letter.</p>
<p>Carey Thiessen, director of operations at First Alliance Church, one of Calgary's largest Christian congregations, says leaders are preparing plans for any flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"We're looking at placing hand sanitizers in our gathering areas. And obviously, if your kids are not feeling well, we're going to encourage people to stay home," said Thiessen.</p>
<p>First Alliance holds communion once a month, but each person is given individual, packaged elements, cutting down the chance for any transfer of flu bugs.</p>
<p>"We're going to take our cue from the local health people. Whenever there is a large gathering of people, obviously we need to be careful," said Thiessen.</p>
<p>Major Stephen Sears of the Salvation Army's Berkshire Citadel Community Church brings a unique perspective to pandemic preparations. He was serving in a downtown Toronto church during the SARS outbreak that killed 43 people in the spring and summer of 2003.</p>
<p>"It was a very surreal experience, seeing so many people wearing masks and going by empty theatres and restaurants," recalled Sears. "Our regular attendance went down about 30 per cent. People began to fear getting together with one another."</p>
<p>Sears said churches can play an important role in breaking down the isolation those suffering from serious illnesses like H1N1 or SARS feel. He noted most Calgary neighbourhoods have at least one place of worship, complete with a large pool of volunteers who can be mobilized quickly.</p>
<p>"We were delivering groceries to families and seniors who were in isolation in Toronto, almost in a lockdown scenario, and checking up on them to let them know they weren't alone," said Sears.</p>
<p>Churches, like other broad-based organizations, should approach any H1N1 threat in a proactive manner, Sears said.</p>
<p>"A lot of people move to Calgary with no immediate family close by. Churches can be that source of support for them."</p>

<p>A team of mathematicians have been picking their large, delectable brains over whether humankind could survive a zombie apocalypse.</p>
<p>Their conclusion?</p>
<p>"An outbreak of zombies infecting humans is likely to be disastrous, unless extremely aggressive tactics are employed against the undead," says the paper, titled When Zombies Attack! Mathematical Modelling of an Outbreak of Zombie Infection.</p>
<p>"Thus, if zombies arrive, we must act quickly and decisively to eradicate them before they eradicate us."</p>
<p>Of course, the researchers --all mathematics students from Carleton University and the University of Ottawa --took their undead, flesh-eating topic with a large pinch of salt.</p>
<p>"If you look at it in a more realistic way, zombies are about the same as any other major infectious disease-- they get out and we try to eliminate them," said Joe Imad, a University of Ottawa mathematics student and one of the paper's co-authors. "Modelling zombies would be the same as modelling swine flu, with some differences for sure, but it is much more interesting to read."</p>
<p>As outlandish as the subject may seem, the researchers say there is a real-life application.</p>
<p>"While the scenarios considered are obviously not realistic, it is nevertheless instructive to develop mathematical models for an unusual outbreak," says the paper, which Imad said got a "pretty good" grade.</p>

<p>McClintock wins gold</p>
<p>LEDUC, Alta. - Jason McClintock of Cambridge won the gold medal in men's elite tricks and slalom on Friday at the Canadian water ski championships. McClintock totalled 9,620 points in the tricks competition and scored 2.510.75 metres for the slalom title. "It's always nice to win a national title," said McClintock, who made two finals at the world championships last week in Calgary. In women's elite competition, Breanne Wagner of Surrey, B.C., took the slalom title with 411.25 while triple world champion Whitney McClintock of Cambridge won tricks with 8,820 points and placed first overall.</p>

<p>Eli Manning tops list</p>
<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning is officially the NFL's highest paid player. A little more than a week after reaching a tentative agreement, Manning signed the six-year extension that will keep him with the team through 2015 and pay him an average salary of $15.3 million US starting next season. Manning is guaranteed $35 million under terms of the $97 million extension. News of the deal first broke on Aug. 5. "It's good to get it out of the way and not have to worry about anything else," Manning said after the Giants held their morning practice at the University at Albany. "Now it's time to get ready for the season." The low-key Manning insisted that being the league's highest paid player would not put any added pressure on him. "My job is to play quarterback for the New York Giants and try to win games," he said. "Nothing has changed."</p>

<p>Ex-Leafs captain dies</p>
<p>PORT COLBORNE - Ted (Teeder) Kennedy, a former Toronto Maple Leafs captain and Hockey Hall of Famer, has died. He was 83. His son Mark says he died Friday morning of congestive heart failure at a nursing home in his hometown of Port Colborne. "It was just a wearing down of the body," said Mark Kennedy. "The last three days, things became pretty serious so it wasn't really a surprise for us. We'd been told maybe a month ago that there wasn't too many more weeks or months left." A veteran of 14 NHL seasons, Kennedy played his entire career with the Maple Leafs and won five Stanley Cups.</p>

<p>Basketball player killed</p>
<p>MILWAUKEE - European league basketball player Lavelle Felton has died from a gunshot wound he suffered earlier this week at a Milwaukee gas station, police said Friday. The 29-year-old died Thursday about 9:30 p.m. CT and no arrests have been made in the shooting, police spokesperson Anne E. Schwartz said. Felton was shot in the head while sitting in the driver's seat of a vehicle at a gas station around 2 a.m. Wednesday morning. He was taken to Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital near Milwaukee, where he died. Schwartz said she was releasing few details because there was no one in custody. Detectives have been interviewing people near the gas station and to Felton's friends and relatives.</p>

<p>South Africans get free tickets</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Organizers are giving South Africans 120,000 free tickets to next year's World Cup in an effort to make the tournament more accessible to citizens living in poverty. The tickets will be given to poor fans working in health care, education and other development fields. FIFA has already set low ticket prices South African residents, starting at 140 rand (about $19 Cdn), compared to $86 Cdn for international tickets. But with more than a quarter of the workforce unemployed, and many of those who do have jobs earning $10 Cdn a day or less, even cheap seats are out of reach. FIFA says its 2010 World Cup Ticket Fund is the first of its kind in the 80 years of the tourney.</p>

<p>LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles Galaxy forward Landon Donovan has tested positive for swine flu, although the team is optimistic he can play tonight. Donovan will be evaluated by a doctor, the Galaxy said. Donovan, David Beckham and Chris Birchall were all given the day off from training Friday after returning from games with their national teams.</p>

</p>
<p>NEW DELHI -- Streets here are filled with armed police as Indians brace for a double whammy -- the real threat of repeat terrorist attacks on Independence Day today, and the potential loss of millions of lives to H1N1.</p>
<p>We have been warned that westerners could be targeted.</p>
<p>Who knew? When you own a small company and are looking to expand through new or improved technology, you have to look at India for a solution. It's a country that in large part speaks English, so nothing is lost in translation. It is also an economic powerhouse that has basically watched the world recession but was never really a part of it. An example of this is India's industrial growth and tourism, both up considerably from this time last year.</p>
<p>So after reviewing all these glowing statistics, we made contact with a prospective company and booked our flights. We later found out that booking the flights was the easiest of all tasks ahead of us. In order to leave right away we had to apply for a visa in person at the Indian consulate in Toronto. There we walked through the first of countless metal detectors, the first thing you do when you enter offices.</p>
<p>After a long flight to London there were more metal detectors and security but nothing prepared us for our arrival at <span class="companylink">Indira Gandhi International Airport</span> -- metal detectors and army personnel with automatic weapons everywhere. They were pleasant to us, but how friendly can you be with an M-16 in your hand?</p>
<p>Even more stern was the nurse who asked if I had a cold or a fever. She was scarier then the guy with the M-16. The H1N1 flu is as high a priority as national security in India. This is no time to be coughing or sneezing.</p>
<p>Once through immigration and customs, we jumped into a taxi to the hotel. Along the way you could see army personnel at strategic points. This city has literally turned into a fortress.</p>
<p>At the hotel there is a large steel gate that would typically be found at some high security complex. Again we are met by guards who check the vehicle thoroughly. The trunk, the engine and the undercarriage were checked with a mirror at the end of a long pole.</p>
<p>Throughout all this the cab driver carries on a conversation about all the fabulous sights, totally oblivious to what's happening to us. As strange as this sounds, most Indian people we met were calmer in nature than our friends in Winnipeg. The security and army personnel did not disrupt their lives at all.</p>
<p>Once settled in, we ventured out on the streets that were filled with different scents only India could have. From the intoxicating smell of the flowers that line the streets to the many different aromas of food being cooked by the outdoor vendors, it was all too good.</p>
<p>But just when you think all is normal, the local newspaper informs us that Canadian and American governments have issued a "travel advisory" that we stay low and be watchful for suspicious people.</p>
<p>This country is bracing for another round of terrorists attacks today, which is Independence Day, and, as western tourists, we are prime targets.</p>
<p>Last year in Mumbai (Bombay), Canadians were among the over 170 people killed in terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Compound this with the H1N1, and we have to wonder what we are doing eating Chaat and drinking Coke at the side of the road. The talk on the street is the possibility that one-third of India's population could succumb to this flu. These numbers are beyond belief -- 300 million people? That's the total population of the United States.</p>
<p>Of course the government and health officials are playing down such talk, but with more than one billion people in this great country, once things start it's almost impossible to stop.</p>
<p>In Delhi and Mumbai the authorities have shut down schools and colleges for a week. In addition, movie theatres and multiplexes are closing until Sunday, the day after Independence Day.</p>
<p>This is Bollywood they are shutting down. In Canada it would be the equivalent to postponing the Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>
<p>The people we speak to are not sure if closing schools and movie theatres is about the H1N1 or a precaution against terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Either way, they carry on with a nod and a smile. For us, however, there is something more in the air than the smells of flowers and food being cooked.</p>

<p>How would you feel if you spent a few days writing a really great song, put it up on your website and the next morning someone else was singing it on the radio as though it was their own?</p>
<p>Oh sure, they changed a few words, but it's your idea, your tune, your work.</p>
<p>You'd feel ripped off, most likely.</p>
<p>You'd wonder how they can get away with it. At the very least, you'd wonder why they didn't give you some credit for your work.</p>
<p>Well, put yourself in Free Press justice reporter Mike McIntyre's shoes. He's been writing stories lately from courtrooms in which he's the only news reporter there.</p>
<p>Yet many mornings, he's hearing those same court stories presented by radio stations which never reveal where they read it first -- in the pages of the Free Press.</p>
<p>Last week, Aldo Santin came to us with a story idea: Was it possible that Ontario had actually changed its H1N1 strategy in the wake of the outbreaks on Manitoba reserves?</p>
<p>It took him two days to chase that story, haranguing health officials at all levels, talking to chiefs of First Nations.</p>
<p>The day it finally was published in the paper, I heard it read aloud on the local "information superstation." It could have been a feed from the wire services, which we supply every night. But at least the wire services give us credit for our work.</p>
<p>There's nothing particularly unusual about this. The Free Press is the largest newsroom in the province, and responsible for 80 per cent of all the news generated in the community.</p>
<p>But every newsroom in North America is under siege in this recession, and as the reporters disappear, more and more broadcast media in particular are relying on the work of this newsroom to fill their newscasts.</p>
<p>It would be fine if they gave those reporters credit for their work, or if they acknowledged where their news was coming from.</p>
<p>It would be even better if they could do what real newsrooms do -- follow our story with their own work, updating or augmenting it with more sources, taking another tack.</p>
<p>But ripping and reading, pretending it's your own work? Stealing quotes from our reporters' Twitters and inserting them into plagiarized stories as though they were at the scene?</p>
<p>Not when my own newsroom is facing cutbacks.</p>
<p>We launched an ad campaign this week, trying to explain the situation to our readers and others.</p>
<p>We want you to know where your news is coming from.</p>
<p>We want you to know that when it comes to local news, entertainment and sports, the Free Press is the best source -- and sometimes the only source -- in town.</p>
<p>It's important to know this because this is a tough time for newspapers.</p>
<p>Market researchers say there's no value in news.</p>
<p>It's free everywhere on the Internet, they say. You can hear it for nothing on the radio, watch it on the television, get it transmitted to your cellphone.</p>
<p>But where did it come from in the first place? Predominately from the journalists who still have jobs at their local newspapers.</p>
<p>I don't agree with those market researchers, obviously.</p>
<p>I think the work this newsroom does is worth a great deal to this community, to the sports teams, the cultural groups, the politicians (or at least their constituents) -- and especially to the other news organizations.</p>
<p>Because whether they tell you or not, they're playing our song.</p>

<p>It may be that winter season bookings have picked up dramatically, but most of my questions this week relate to long-distance travel issues. Even as you read this column I, on the other hand, am on a journey of a much closer destination. I will be with the grandchildren enjoying the water park at the Radisson Hotel in Bloomington, while the rest of the family sees how many of the stores in the Mall of America can be visited in a few hours. Since the hotel is just across the street from the Mall, if the kids are too exhausted I may wander over with them to let them experience a few rides in the Nickelodeon Universe.</p>
<p>Q. We have booked a cruise on RCCl's Vision of the Seas with port stops in Athens, Greece, Haifa and Jerusalem in Israel, Alexandria, Egypt, Rhodes, Greece, plus Istanbul and Ephesus (Kusadasi) to name a few. Your advice on anything we should avoid, along with sights or excursions you recommend would be appreciated. Should we be booking our excursions in advance through the RCCI website?</p>
<p>A. I have not been to Egypt so I can't give you recommendations from experience. However, I have been to Turkey as well as Greece and am happy to provide some input for those port stops.</p>
<p>Even though one is tired at the end of the day, I prefer full day trips as opposed to half-day excursions, unless you like the freedom to shop and explore on your own.</p>
<p>In Turkey, I don't recommend the Bosphorus mini cruise as you will have already been on that body of water and in my opinion it wasn't that good a tour to start with.</p>
<p>The city tour is excellent, but the truth is you can get around Istanbul fairly easily because a number of the major sites are fairly close to each other. While not as big as the Grand Bazaar, we preferred the Spice Market but both are worth visiting. The crowds at the Grand Bazaar are overwhelming.</p>
<p>Be sure to try the kebobs from one of the outdoor stands.</p>
<p>Ephesus is one of the major sites in the world and is the only thing we didn't see on our last trip to Turkey. However, we will see it this fall as a part of the cruise we are taking out of Istanbul on Oct. 2. I have talked to many about this excursion and the feedback is consistently positive. A day trip is likely the one to take, regardless of what you choose to do elsewhere.</p>
<p>Each to his and her own so you need to follow your interests, but I would take a rural tour from Rhodes. This was my interest but there is a lot to see everywhere.</p>
<p>Greece, and Athens in particular, can be a bit overwhelming but it is an exceptional city nevertheless. The Acropolis and theatre of Dionysos on the south slope are tourist must-sees.</p>
<p>The Plaka is the food and entertainment centre. If your ship leaves late, it's likely a good place to spend the evening.</p>
<p>I could go on about the impact of Jerusalem forever. The Wailing Wall, the site where Jesus supposedly was crucified and the emotional impact at being at sites of three major religions will be etched in your memory forever.</p>
<p>I don't know how much time you have but the trip to Galilee with one of their experienced licensed guides will trigger religious impressions no matter what your own faith may be.</p>
<p>Q. We are two couples travelling to France and Italy for September-October this fall.</p>
<p>What is the latest news about the flu and travel? Anything we should be aware of at this time?</p>
<p>A. It seems to me that every country is working on a H1N1 strategy just in case the flu becomes an epidemic in the fall and winter. As you know from reading the newspapers, to the degree it is serious, no country is immune from residents, or visitors for that matter, becoming ill with this disease.</p>
<p>It is important you have full insurance coverage this year to make certain you will be flown back if you should get sick, or to cover medical costs associated with out-of-country care.</p>
<p>What is interesting is that different regions seem to experience the disease to different extremes. While most people suffer only from similar symptoms as regular flu, with many recovering even before their illness is officially designated as H1N1, others get extremely sick as we have seen in northern Manitoba.</p>
<p>There really is no way of knowing, but the usual precautions of regular hand washing and hand sanitizers is important.</p>
<p>We don't know when a vaccination against this strain of flu will be available, so in the meantime we need to take the above actions at home and away.</p>
<p>Q. How do I get a suitcase or box to Europe ahead of my trip? Are there luggage services that do this?</p>
<p>A. www.smartertravel.com[http://www.smartertravel.com] gives the following suggestions: Luggage Concierge (800-288-9818), Luggage Forward (866-416-7447), Luggage Free (800-361-6871), Sports Express (800-357-4174), The Luggage Club (877-231-5131), and Virtual Bellhop (877-235-5467). As the website states, each company picks up your baggage wherever you designate, does all the paperwork necessary for shipment, arranges for delivery to a designated address at your destination and tracks the shipment's progress. These services are expensive and so long as you have a destination address, the normal overseas courier companies may be more cost-efficient.</p>

<p>Forget about the vaccine.</p>
<p>A group of about 50 rabbis and Kabbalah mystics circled over Israel in a chartered airplane this week, praying and blowing ceremonial rams' horns called shofars in an attempt to ward off the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>The Health Ministry has verified that more than 2,000 Israelis have contracted the flu during the global pandemic and five have died.</p>
<p>“We are certain that, thanks to the prayer, the danger is already behind us,” Rabbi Yitzhak Batzri, one of the participants, told the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper after the flight.</p>
<p>This marks the third time since 1948 that spiritual leaders have held prayers on planes circling the country. The first time was during the Gulf War in 1991 and the second was in 1996 after the wave of terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>The concept of a prayer flight was introduced during the Second World War by Rabbi Batzri's grandfather, Rabbi Yehudah Pattaya, because of fears that the Nazis would invade Israel through Egypt.</p>
<p>In the air on Monday, the passengers recited prayers intended for abolishing illnesses and seven times blew the shofar, which traditionally is used for such functions as announcing the new year, introducing Shabbat and marking the end of the day of fasting on Yom Kippur.</p>
<p>However, despite Rabbi Batzri's optimism, the Health Ministry is expecting the flu to hit Israel hard in the fall and winter and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised that the government will buy enough of the vaccine, once it is developed, to protect all of the country's citizens.</p>

<div>In Muskoka</div>
<div>Post Toronto</div>
<div id="hd"><b>This summer sucks; And nowhere has it been more noticed than in Muskoka, with heavy rains that have caused malaise--and much worse</b>
</div><div>Deborah Stokes   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>1018 words</div><div>15 August 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>Toronto</div><div>TO3</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>In the pouring rain last Sunday, people packed into the Port Carling Legion where $7 -- $3 for children -- buys an all-you-can-eat buffet breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausages, pancakes, French toast, homefries, coffee and juice. For an extra $1, you also get Eggs Benny.</p>
<p>Offered year-round and now in its seventh year, the Sunday brunch has caught on with the summer people, the cottagers and visitors who dramatically swell the population here for nine weeks or so a year.</p>
<p>Gloria Dyer, the volunteer working the door, says an average of 150 people turn up each Sunday for the Legion's brunch-fundraiser; a record 200 people came on the August civic holiday weekend.</p>
<p>That's because it is cheap and indoors, two main attractions this summer in Muskoka, Canada's premier cottage country about two hours north of Toronto.</p>
<p>A black cloud that rolled in at the beginning of summer has stubbornly settled over the multi-million-dollar cottages, boutiques, luxury resorts, golf and country clubs that line the Muskoka lakes. The Legion's brunch aside, this is the summer that's sucked for cottagers and local businesses.</p>
<p>For the month of July alone, Environment Canada reports 164.5 millimetres of rain fell, beating the last record set in 2000 of 135.8 mm, and volumes more than the normal 93 mm. Locals count 21 days of rain so far in July and August, too much for a place where the year-round livelihood depends on sun-drenched dock days.</p>
<p>And the dreadful weather is only part of it. Some camps in the area were hit by an H1N1 flu outbreak in early July, affecting more than 200 children. Then there have been the tragedies -- 10 deaths in one recent 10-day span, including five drownings (some blame the heavy rainfall that has strengthened currents in waterways) and a float plane crash that claimed the life of Jack Lawrence, a prominent Toronto financier.</p>
<p>But the No. 1 topic of conversation is the weather. Ken Buchanan is the lockmaster at the Port Carling locks, the hub of the Muskoka lakes and the passageway for boats travelling between Lake Muskoka and Lake Joseph on the Indian River. A retired banker from Toronto, Buchanan and his wife, Ollie, have been living or cottaging in the area for 27 years. "It's the worst summer weather that I can remember," he says.</p>
<p>Boat traffic is way down. "It's 100% dependant on what's happening above us," says Buchanan, pointing to the overcast skies. He says the drop in traffic--and the size of boats --is bigger than last summer, the beginning of the recession and the beginning of the end of free-spending ways.</p>
<p>From his vantage point, Buchanan sees a change taking place on the lakes: Gone are the partiers in expensive speedboats, replaced by families in cruisers. "People are more edgy," he says.</p>
<p>Of course, Muskoka isn't the only place in Canada with summer weather woes on top of recession woes. But the effects are more keenly felt in this precious playground. There are big expectations from those few short weeks of summer. Cottagers -- those who didn't sell when their portfolios collapsed -- are still coming, but less often and without their entourages.</p>
<p>"People are listening to the weather reports and are making the decision not to come up and drop their cash," says Adam Szelei, owner of Tapps Cottage Eatery in Port Carling. "Business is absolutely horrible, worse than last year," he says. He blames the weather, but also a pullback in spending and in having fun. Last summer's horrific car crash that killed three young men who had been drinking at one of the posh Muskoka country clubs and then went off the road into the water near Minett, has had lingering effects, he says. The police are cracking down on drinking and driving, "and people are afraid to go out anymore."</p>
<p>For the luxury Red Leaves condominium-resort, which opened six months ago on the shores of Lake Rosseau, the timing of the rains and recession could not have been worse. Eighty-four units in the 221-suite resort are unsold and the developer has been forced into receivership. The resort, managed by J. W. Marriott, is fully operating, however, and a one-day bankruptcy sale, to take place sometime this month, will sell the remaining units for an estimated 35% discount.</p>
<p>Owners who buy a unit -- prices start at around $160,000 for a small studio suite, up to $650,000 for a large one-bedroom -- get to use their slice of Muskoka life for nine weeks a year. The units then go into a rental pool and owners share in the revenue.</p>
<p>There are still a few weeks of summer left and the forecast for Muskoka is showing some bright spots.</p>
<p>Gary Kadonoff has owned and managed the IGA in Port Carling for 19 years. His busy grocery store carries everything a well-heeled cottager desires, from wild blueberries plucked from nearby woods to organic breads. He recently extended his summer hours by an extra two hours a day. The downturn and downpours haven't hurt his business much, he says. "People aren't going out as much for dinner; they are staying home and cooking instead."</p>
<p>Kadonoff has noticed fewer U. S. licence plates in his parking lot this summer, but is optimistic August sales will surpass last year, especially with the late Labour Day, which means an extra week of summer. "We had a late start, but we'll have a late finish."</p>
<p>Summer may be saved.</p>

<p>Flu Deaths Halt Bollywood Releases</p>
<p>Film - The release of two high-profile Bollywood films has been postponed after swine flu forced the closure of cinemas in the Mumbai area, their producers said Wednesday.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">UTV Motion Pictures</span> and Indian Films said Kaminey (Scoundrel) and Life Partner would not open as planned today in Mumbai, two neighbouring districts or in the city of Pune because of rising swine flu cases.</p>
<p>Both film will open elsewhere, including in Calgary.</p>
<p>Two people in Mumbai have died after catching the H1N1 virus, while Pune, 120 kilometres away, has had eight deaths--the largest number in India.</p>
<p>A total of 17 people with swine flu have died in India since Aug. 3, the Press Trust of India news agency said.</p>
<p>Mariah Carey Album Delayed Again</p>
<p>Music - Originally scheduled for an Aug. 25 release date and then Sept. 15, Mariah Carey's upcoming 12th studio album, has been delayed yet again.</p>
<p>Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel will now arrive two weeks later on Sept. 29. A source at her Def Jam label said the singer needs to return to the studio to record additional songs.</p>
<p>Carey has also pulled out of a string of appearances surrounding the album's release, including VH1 Storytellers, the Today Show concert series, the MTV Video Music Awards and her Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony.</p>
<p>The album's first single, Obsessed, reached No. 11 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Memoirs has already stirred up controversy with the label's decision to include advertising in the CD packaging, in the form of a mini-Elle magazine featuring Carey-related content.</p>
<p>Mad Men Goes Online In Canada</p>
<p>TV - The hit television show Mad Men is breaking new ground in Canada, and it has nothing to do with ratings or sassy, misogynistic one-liners. When the third season of this inside look at a 1960s advertising firm debuts this fall on AMC, viewers who do not subscribe to the digital channel can purchase the episode directly from iTunes for $2.50, or $3.50 in high definition.</p>
<p>The show will be available for purchase after the episode has aired, and though this has been the case for the past two seasons, this season it is the only way for viewers in Canada without access to AMC to watch the show. Subscription to AMC is available only through Shaw and Rogers and is not offered by Bell ExpressVu satellite service.</p>
<p>This marks the first time that a popular TV show has been made available exclusively in digital format, bypassing traditional distribution routes.</p>

<p>New on DVD This Week</p>
<p>The Last House on the Left: Most definitely not for the faint of heart--or those who object to graphic rape scenes--this remake of the Wes Craven classic features Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter as parents who refuse to turn the other cheek when their daughter is attacked by a gang of deadbeats.</p>
<p>Hannah Montana: The Movie: Not quite the polar opposite of the previous flick as you'd think. Both movies involve torture: Last House with blunt instruments, Hannah Montana with the treacly tale of a good ol' country girl (Miley Cyrus) who just happens to be a pop star in her alter-ego guise. Ewwww!</p>
<p>Labor Pain: To continue the horror theme, we have Lindsay Lohan's latest: a cable-TV movie that has found its way to DVD. La Lohan is Thea, a secretary who claims she's pregnant in order to keep her job. Pssst, here's a little secret, Linds: if you're pregnant, you have to eat something.</p>
<p>Love Comes Lately: Three short stories by Nobel Prize-winning author Isaac Bashevis Singer come to life under the direction of Jan Schutte as Otto Tausig takes on the lively role of aging ladies' man Max.</p>
<p>Streets of Blood: If the top-billed actors--Val Kilmer, 50 Cent and Sharon Stone--aren't enough to scare you off this thriller set in the Big Easy, maybe this sample of dialogue will do it: "The rule of thumb in the drug world when there's this much money is that there is always law enforcement corruption." Gah!</p>
<p>Surveillance: The survivors of a roadside massacre offer up conflicting stories to the hinky FBI agents (Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond) investigating the killings in this dark thriller from Jennifer Lynch.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tech on campus: A student's take; From online notes, to blackboard scribbles, I've probably experienced just about every type of professor, in terms of how they use technology.</b>
</div><div>Jenny Mitchell  </div>

  </div>
</p>
<p>Five minutes into my first chemistry lecture, I knew I was doomed. After handing out the course outline and exam schedule, the professor confessed that he didn't bother with "any of that Power Point stuff."</p>
<p>And then apologized in advance for his "terrible handwriting."</p>
<p>Two weeks before the midterm, I had a binder full of notes that didn't make any sense. And then it dawned on me. Sure, my chemistry professor didn't upload podcasts or lecture notes online. But Waterloo's other chemistry prof, who was teaching the exact same class that semester, did.</p>
<p>I was saved.</p>
<p>After completing my first year on campus, I've probably experienced just about every type of professor, in terms of how they use technology. This includes one who offers his lecture slides online, and another who podcasts all of her lectures, making them available throughout the term. And Mr. Chemistry, who presents those illegible lecture-based notes with absolutely no online components.</p>
<p>The campus classroom has undergone a major high-tech overhaul. Professors no longer just lecture in the classroom - most now offer a full-blown media buffet. Universities appear to be adapting to this generation's multi-media craze, helping to turn possible distractions into grade boosters.</p>
<p>Podcasts</p>
<p>For those who aren't tech savvy, podcasts are downloadable audio and/or video files. Translation? Professors can record their lectures and then post them online. Sleeping in late is no longer a disaster. Just listen to a podcast of the exact lecture you missed. They make great study tools, since you can listen to a podcast whenever and wherever you want, however many times you need. Plus they're pause-able. If you want to jot down a valuable nugget in your notes, you won't miss a thing.</p>
<p>Clickers</p>
<p>This gadget is quickly gaining popularity in university classrooms, spreading to lecture halls everywhere. They resemble a mini T.V. remote and are used in class to answer questions about the material being presented. The professor will ask a multiple choice question, then students, each armed with their own clicker, can press a button on the clicker corresponding to their chosen answer. With the click of a button, Clicker questions show students what they know, what they don't know, and what they think they know but really had no clue about.</p>
<p>YouTube and Facebook</p>
<p>Some professors will use every type of media to help make concepts really stick. My health studies professor gave links to YouTube clips of movies like Pulp Fiction during the drugs and addictions module of the course. No one from that class will ever forget the symptoms of an overdose. Another professor started a Facebook group to discuss key points of the course that students were having trouble with.</p>
<p>Online notes</p>
<p>Key points, even entire lectures, can be outlined for the class on Power Point presentations or overhead slides. A lot of professors go a step further and have these notes posted online, available for students to print off and add to their notes. Almost every professor I had last year used this technique. If the professor has posted their slides before the lecture, students can print them off and bring them to class, using them as starter notes that can be added to.</p>
<p>What's really fabulous about this lecture extra is that you now have the freedom to sit back and actually absorb the lecture, instead of furiously scribbling every utterance that comes out of the prof's mouth. No more moments of pure frustration when you realize you've missed the last 20 minutes of the lecture while trying to copy down the overhead slide.</p>
<p>Websites</p>
<p>Textbooks will often have a website to delve further into subjects discussed in the text, and often provide practice tests to check your knowledge. Some professors are now starting to have tests and quizzes online using these sites. My genetics professor last year had ten optional bonus assignments to be completed online. If you finished them all, you received a 5-per-cent bonus at the end of the term.</p>
<p>Other aspects</p>
<p>Technology has a huge impact on the way university students learn today. And the reach of technology on campus doesn't stop in the lecture halls. It's now reaching into all areas of university. You can now enroll and drop courses online, pay your tuition, buy your books, fill out forms, submit essays, and even take tests online.</p>
<p>What will the future bring five, even 10, years from now? Who knows. But this fall, when the H1N1 virus hits full-force, some of these high-tech tools could give students the choice to complete lectures at home, far away from crowded lecture halls. The most important role of podcasts and online notes might be yet to come.</p>

</p>
<p>World Not Prepared For H1N1 Outbreak - Aug. 10</p>
<p>After reading the above article, I feel compelled to let you know what Ontario is doing to prepare for the upcoming flu season.</p>
<p>The ministry has been working on pandemic preparedness for several years. Ontario's health system is guided by the Ontario Health Plan for an Influenza Pandemic (OHPIP).</p>
<p>The OHPIP is a direct product of our work with hundreds of stakeholders and different levels of government. This plan has been tested on a regular basis and is regularly updated as new information becomes available.</p>
<p>Thanks to our planning stockpiles of both infection prevention and control supplies and of antivirals are now in place. Ontario is in a good position to deal with a pandemic. If the disease increased in severity, additional measures would be undertaken in accordance with the OHPIP. The OHPIP is available for download to anyone via the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care website: http://www.health.gov.on.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/english/public/updates/archives/hu_09/swine_flu.html[http://www.health.gov.on.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/english/public/updates/archives/hu_09/swine_flu.html]www.ontario.ca/flu[http://www.ontario.ca/flu] END</p>
<p>We are one of the only jurisdictions in the Northern Hemisphere to offer a free flu shot to all residents and we've been doing so for almost 10 years. We are also preparing to offer a separate H1N1 flu shot to anyone that wants and needs one this autumn and through the winter flu season.</p>
<p>Ontario has regularly provided guidance to the health sector and the public to prevent the spread of the virus and respond to cases of the flu throughout this pandemic and will continue to do so through the flu season this autumn. We are anticipating a different flu season and are preparing for a mixture of seasonal and H1N1 flu viruses in the province. We are actively reviewing our guidelines now within the context of our own experience and that of the Southern Hemisphere and expect to issue updated guidelines to the health care sector and other distinct populations, such as schools, in the coming weeks. Of course, as new information comes available we will update our guidelines.</p>
<p>Flu activity in Ontario remains above what is expected for this time of year. Ontarians should continue to follow the same precautionary measures recommended to protect against seasonal influenza - wash hands frequently and well, cover coughs and sneezes, and keep commonly touched surfaces clean and disinfected.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>City lays groundwork for H1N1 surge - Officials plot plan for police, key services</b>
</div><div>By Mia Rabson    </div>
<div>898 words</div><div>14 August 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The City of Winnipeg is prepared to reallocate staff and call people back from retirement if H1N1 influenza erupts into a full-blown pandemic this fall.</p>
<p>Randy Hull, Winnipeg's emergency preparedness co-ordinator, said the city is planning as if H1N1 is going to hit with a vengeance.</p>
<p>"We always plan for the worst-case scenario," Hull said.</p>
<p>That means officials have created models of how the city might react if as many as half of its workers stay home because they or a family member is sick with H1N1.</p>
<p>Since H1N1 appeared this spring, more than 1,300 Canadians have been hospitalized and more than 200 have ended up in intensive care. Sixty-six people have died.</p>
<p>Overall, more than 6,000 cases were confirmed but statistics on the number of people with mild cases are not complete because they stopped testing after awhile except in serious illnesses. In Manitoba, more than 200 people have been hospitalized and seven people have died.</p>
<p>The question is: What will happen when flu season strikes again?</p>
<p>Public health officials have said it's possible H1N1 will not be any worse but it's also possible it will become more severe -- morphing into a devastating global pandemic. So governments, such as Winnipeg's, are getting ready.</p>
<p>In Winnipeg, departments have been classified as essential, sustainable or regular services and the city has compiled lists of which services need to continue and in what capacity.</p>
<p>It means, said Hull, the focus is on the health, safety and security of Winnipeg residents. So if thousands of people fall ill in Winnipeg, firefighters will still be in fire halls and health inspectors will still make calls.</p>
<p>But potholes might be ignored for awhile and services such as library programs might go on a temporary hiatus.</p>
<p>"Are we going to patch every sinkhole?" Hull said. "No. But we'll barricade it to make sure it's safe."</p>
<p>Police services could be scaled back to basic patrols. Specialized units might be suspended and officers moved into squad cars.</p>
<p>In departments where workers need specialized skills or training, such as waste-water treatment-plant workers, contingencies are being made to train others as backups, or possibly call back retirees to help out.</p>
<p>The city has also distributed hand sanitizers and wipes to workers who come into frequent contact with the public or who don't have easy access to a bathroom to wash their hands.</p>
<p>Bulletins have been posted giving advice to employees on everything from healthier living to answering questions about sick time.</p>
<p>Police and firefighters are being fitted for specialized face masks. Operators at 9-1-1 are asking additional questions to callers to advise paramedics if their patient has flu symptoms so paramedics can don masks and other protective equipment.</p>
<p>Hull said the city will take its cue from Manitoba Health and Health Canada about whether to close libraries, rec centres and other places where people gather.</p>
<p>The federal government expects to issue advice next week on whether schools should close in the event of a pandemic.</p>
<p>This week, the federal government also hired a Winnipeg agency to help small- and medium-sized businesses prepare.</p>
<p>"In a pandemic we know there is a significant health impact but there is a significant economic impact as well," said Heather Medwick, acting CEO of the International Centre for Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>ICID, in co-operation with the Canadian Chambers of Commerce, was given a contract for $926,600 to develop a communications program to help businesses determine how they should prepare for a pandemic.</p>
<p>Medwick said the aim will be to have a web-based communication program so business owners can go online, fill out a form that answers questions about the size and nature of their business and get back a basic or detailed plan on how to proceed.</p>
<p>"If we can get them thinking about these questions now it won't be such a shock later," Medwick said.</p>
<p>There are basic issues such as employees calling in sick or coming to work while sick and whether or not they should be sent home.</p>
<p>Other questions include what work can be done from home, maintaining communication with suppliers and customers, and whether stocking extra inventory should be done in case transportation is slowed.</p>
<p>Janine Halbesma, spokeswoman for the Canadian Federation of Business, said businesses also need to be given information to help keep their employees healthy.</p>
<p>"Our goal right now is still to prevent a pandemic," she said.</p>
<p>That means giving members advice on using hand sanitizers and having soap dispensers full and ventilation systems working properly.</p>
<p>Rod Snyder, operations manager at <span class="companylink">Freightliner Manitoba</span> said his company has had a few discussions about H1N1 but "they've been minimal."</p>
<p>Snyder said in previous years <span class="companylink">Freightliner</span> has offered flu shots to its employees but the uptake was minimal.</p>
<p>Nobody from the company was sick or knew anyone who was sick with H1N1 either, so it's tough to get people's attention, he said.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Freightliner</span>, a truck dealer that has more than 100 employees, doesn't yet have a plan. But Snyder said it's likely they will take advantage of whatever information can be gleaned from the ICID project when it's ready.</p>

<p>When it comes to providing thoughtful examination of serious policy issues, the recent track record of parliamentary committees is mixed at best. Still, the government's dismissive attitude toward opposition MPs' attempts to ask questions about the steps being taken to protect Canadians from the H1N1 virus is surprising.</p>
<p>It may be true, as Leona Aglukkaq, the federal Minister of Health, said at a press conference this week, that she has given the opposition ample information about the government's handling of the virus through private briefings, and that its critics are welcome to contact her with their questions. But it is not too much to ask that she provide explanations and respond to pertinent questions about a potentially life-and-death issue in a public forum. If the government is as confident in its H1N1 response as it has claimed, and eager to set to rest Canadians' concerns, it should have welcomed the opportunity.</p>
<p>Instead, the government sang a familiar refrain that the opposition – the Liberals in particular – are more interested in playing politics than in contributing to public policy. Joy Smith, a Conservative MP who is the chair of the House of Commons health committee, initially called the request to convene a rare summer meeting “a little mischief” and “an example of very unfortunate political gamesmanship.” Ms. Aglukkaq echoed Ms. Smith's sentiments hours before appearing in front of the committee on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It is to the minister's credit that she made the appearance, but it was not an act of heroism. Even so, her Conservative colleagues on the committee repeatedly noted the sacrifice of her time, and Ms. Aglukkaq left the meeting before some of the MPs had expected, after answering only a few questions.</p>
<p>The opposition's professions of outrage at Ms. Aglukkaq's departure – in particular some theatrics from Carolyn Bennett, the Liberal health critic – perhaps validated the government's concern about political spectacle. But then, Ms. Bennett is a politician; so, too, is Ms. Aglukkaq. A degree of partisan interest is always at play, and it is often far more overt than it was this week.</p>
<p>Challenging the government on matters of the public interest is what an opposition ought to do. If opposition members were happy to interrupt their summers to spend time in Ottawa talking about a pandemic that threatens Canadians' lives, the minister in charge of combatting that pandemic should have been no less eager.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu panic overblown, medical officer says; First wave of virus was not as dire as expected and scale of infection in Southern Hemisphere is not nearly as bad as feared</b>
</div><div>CAROLINE ALPHONSO   </div>
<div>731 words</div><div>14 August 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Are fears of swine flu being overblown? It depends on whom you ask.</p>
<p>Health authorities are bracing for what they expect to be a busier-than-normal flu season as the new pandemic virus circles the globe. But at least one doctor says that Canadians may see a less severe impact from H1N1 than they did from the Fujian flu in 2003, the last big influenza year.</p>
<p>Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief medical officer of health, said in an interview yesterday that the first wave of the virus this spring was not as dire as expected, and the number of people infected in the Southern Hemisphere, now in the middle of its regular flu season, is nowhere as bad as feared.</p>
<p>“When it comes to Canada, the worst we should expect is what they're seeing in Australia, which is slightly worse than a normal flu year,” said Dr. Schabas, medical officer of health for the Hastings and Prince Edward Counties Health Unit.</p>
<p>“But in fact, we'll probably see something that won't be that bad because it's the second time around with us, and by way of comparison, we would not expect it to be as bad as the flu year was in 2003 with the Fujian strain.”</p>
<p>A/Fujian influenza resulted in a particularly bad flu season in 2003 and accounted for more than 90 per cent of reported cases. That year's vaccine was formulated before the strain appeared, although it still provided some protection.</p>
<p>Dr. Schabas said that while it's foolish to argue against being prepared for a resurgence of H1N1 this fall, health authorities need to take stock of the situation. Many Canadians have already been infected, so they have some immunity, he said. And the World Health Organization recently said the virus in the Southern Hemisphere “appeared slightly worse than a normal influenza season.”</p>
<p>A pandemic, Dr. Schabas said, was expected to kill thousands of Canadians. Canada's death toll from swine flu is 66. “You tell me how overblown that is?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Our preparations always have to be advised not just by the sense of possibilities, but by a sense of probabilities,” Dr. Schabas said, stressing that health authorities need to take a “hard look” at what could happen this fall.</p>
<p>“In a sense, the Public Health Agency of Canada has painted itself into a corner. For the last five years, they've been talking about how terrible an influenza pandemic was going to be. Then the H1N1 came along and everyone said it was a pandemic therefore it must be a terrible thing, therefore we must make all of these preparations, we must spend all of this money, we've got to frighten all these people and it's kind of got a momentum of its own,” he said.</p>
<p>“Now is the time to say wait a minute. We didn't know four months ago what was going to happen. We still don't know what's going to happen. But we have much, much better information now than we had four months ago.”</p>
<p>That may well be the case, but others in the field argue that preparation is the key to avoiding a pandemic like the 1918 Spanish flu, which started mildly but killed millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>Donald Low, chief microbiologist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, said the H1N1 virus appears to be having the same impact as the Fujian flu.</p>
<p>“We're between a rock and a hard place here. All of us are speculating on what's going to happen,” Dr. Low said. “This is new waters for us. It's incumbent upon us to be prepared, but realizing that it may well be a relatively mild season and the attack rate might be quite low.”</p>
<p>* * * * * * *</p>
<p>Flu reaches around the world</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus has killed at least 1,462 people, and countries are no longer required to report individual cases.</p>
<p>Spread of the pandemic</p>
<p>As of Aug. 6</p>
<p>Total Americas 1,274 deaths</p>
<p>Africa 1</p>
<p>Europe 53</p>

<p>Winnipeg is prepared to reallocate staff and call people back from retirement if the return of H1N1 influenza this fall turns into a full-blown pandemic.</p>
<p>Randy Hull, Winnipeg's emergency preparedness co-ordinator, said the city is hoping for the best but planning as if H1N1 is going to hit with a vengeance this fall -- when as much as half the city's staff could stay home because they or a family member is sick with H1N1.</p>
<p>Since H1N1 appeared this spring, over 1,300 Canadians have been hospitalized and more than 200 have ended up in intensive care.</p>
<p>Sixty-six deaths have occurred in Canada.</p>
<p>Public health officials have said it's possible H1N1 won't be any worse in the fall, but it's also possible it could turn into the kind of global pandemic that causes worldwide health and economic catastrophes.</p>
<p>Plans include scaling back police services to the basics of patrols and squad cars.</p>
<p>In departments where workers need specialized skills or training, such as wastewater treatment plant workers, contingencies are being made to cross-train others as back-ups, or possibly call people who recently retired to come back in to help out.</p>
<p>Police and firefighters are being fitted for specialized face masks.</p>
<p>Operators at 9-1-1 are asking additional questions to callers to be able to advise paramedics if their patient has flu symptoms so that the paramedics responding to emergencies can don masks and other protective equipment.</p>

<p>Canadian businesses will get some help from the federal government to prepare for a second wave of the swine flu pandemic in the fall, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>At a weekly news conference, Aglukkaq said the government has awarded a contract worth $926,000 to the International Centre for Infectious Diseases, a Winnipeg-based non-profit organization.</p>
<p>The Public Health Organization and Canadian Chamber of Commerce will work with the centre to help small and medium-sized businesses develop pandemic plans.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said many large companies have begun to address business continuity issues, but smaller companies do not have plans in place to deal with absenteeism and other issues that are expected to arise during the fall flu season.</p>
<p>"This will help develop tools and strategies that small and medium-sized businesses can use for business continuity planning," said the minister.</p>
<p>The government also plans to release a new guidance document in the fall aimed at businesses, said the health minister.</p>

<p>After warning her opposition critics to not "play politics" with the swine flu pandemic, federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq met with them yesterday at a heated House of Commons health committee meeting and assured MPs that pandemic planning for the fall flu season is well in hand.</p>
<p>The minister and opposition MPs have been at odds and trading accusations over how the Conservative government has handled the outbreak and whether it is adequately prepared to help Canadians when a second wave of the pandemic is expected to hit this fall.</p>
<p>Liberal health critic Carolyn Bennett and New Democratic Party health critic Judy Wasylycia-Leis have been particularly vocal in their criticisms of the minister, saying she</p>
<p>hasn't been visible enough on the file and that they have not been given the answers they want from her or her officials. They requested the special committee meeting, which brought MPs back from their constituencies and irritated the minister.</p>
<p>During a news conference yesterday where Aglukkaq announced nearly $1 million in funding to help small businesses prepare pandemic plans, she said she was disappointed the meeting was called and suggested it was taking people away from important work.</p>
<p>"If my colleagues have any concerns, I am here to speak to them. They do not need to send an open letter to the press or to recall a parliamentary committee meeting in the middle of the summer."</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO and OTTAWA -- The question of how the federal government has handled the flu pandemic became a high-stakes political game in Ottawa yesterday as the Health Minister and her opposition critics rushed to hold back-to-back events.</p>
<p>The tone was set early in the day, 2½ hours before an emergency health-committee meeting, when Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq scheduled a morning news conference to slam opposition parties for playing politics with the H1N1 virus. Ever since the virus emerged, the minister has almost always scheduled conferences late in the afternoon and later in the week.</p>
<p>Then, at the midsummer parliamentary committee meeting, rife with political theatre, the opposition accused the government of hiding information, stalling and spending money to woo former U.S. president Bill Clinton to a speaking event rather than focusing on the pandemic.</p>
<p>A verbal fight broke out at one point when Ms. Aglukkaq tried to leave the meeting sooner than expected. Liberal critic Carolyn Bennett called it “unacceptable,” and there were threats to suspend the meeting. But in the end, the meeting continued with David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer. The minister later said she had to finalize her travel plans for an upcoming trip to Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>At issue was opposition MPs insisting the federal government was ill-equipped to deal with a possible resurgence of the H1N1 virus this fall.</p>
<p>“We expected that more planning would have been done this summer and we would by now be at the point where we hear specific plans,” Judy Wasylycia-Leis, the NDP health critic, told the committee. “It doesn't look like we're actually ready for … the fall. What happens if there is a significant outbreak in the fall?”</p>
<p>Ms. Wasylycia-Leis questioned why Ottawa is covering 60 per cent of the vaccine costs, leaving the rest to provinces and territories. “You have money through this stimulus package to bring in Bill Clinton,” she said, referring to the $3-million tourism stimulus grant that is being used to bring Mr. Clinton to the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto for a speaking event.</p>
<p>The government said provinces and territories normally pay the full cost of seasonal flu shots, but it stepped up to pay 60 per cent of the H1N1 vaccine because of its seriousness.</p>
<p>Dr. Butler-Jones said the country is better prepared now than ever for the pandemic. The government has stockpiles of antiviral drugs, and a vaccine for everyone who needs it will be ready by November, he said. Further, the government awarded a $926,000 contract to the International Centre for Infectious Diseases, a non-profit organization in Winnipeg, to develop tools and strategies that small- and medium-sized businesses could use to plan for a pandemic. New guidelines for schools are expected to be released next week.</p>
<p>“Things have been going like crazy. We are in such a different place today in terms of responses,” Dr. Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the minister told reporters that time was better spent planning, rather than calling what she deemed an unnecessary health committee meeting. She said the government has had 22 technical briefings with opposition parties, “above and beyond” what is normally done in politics. Also, health authorities have held more than 20 news conferences to share information with the Canadian public.</p>
<p>“I'm disappointed they took this approach, because doors are open. We've communicated with Canadians weekly, and what we share with them today is what we share with you weekly,” Ms. Aglukkaq said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu crisis raises stakes, in lab dispute</b>
</div><div>Trish Audette </div>

</p>
<p>As potential for a flu-related crisis worries Albertans, critics wonder whether a labour dispute at a private laboratory company is a symptom of a system-wide health problem.</p>
<p>"The threat of a strike or a walkout is very serious, particularly when there's a pandemic looming," Edmonton-Riverview Liberal MLA Kevin Taft said Wednesday, particularly when there is concern about a breakout of the H1N1 virus, or swine flu.</p>
<p>The province intervened this week in a potential strike involving Dynalife and its lab workers. Alberta Health Services contracts medical tests to Dynalife's 36 locations across central and northern Alberta.</p>
<p>"Our immediate concern is the well-being of Albertans," an Employment and Immigration spokesman Barrie Harrison said.</p>
<p>Particularly in northern Alberta communities, if Dynalife workers were locked out or on strike, people would face immediate emergency risks, he said.</p>
<p>However, the province has no immediate plans to make lab work an essential service.</p>
<p>In Alberta, police officers, firefighters and ambulance workers are barred from striking, Harrison said.</p>
<p>But the idea that a private company's strike position could cripple the health-care system is problematic, Edmonton-Strathcona NDP MLA Rachel Notley said.</p>
<p>"If it's an essential service they probably ought to stop privatizing it at the rate they are," she said.</p>
<p>The province's lab work was largely privatized with cuts to government spending in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>In recent months, both opposition parties have raised questions about Dynalife's proximity to the government, noting former Dynalife employees have been placed highly in Alberta Health Services' new management.</p>
<p>But health services spokesman Mark Kastner said Wednesday the board had nothing to do with the government's decision to intervene in the negotiations.</p>
<p>It is unclear what the province's backup plan is for dealing with medical tests in the case of a strike or lockout. Kastner has declined to say how many public labs remain in operation across northern Alberta.</p>
<p>How much Dynalife is paid by the government each year also has not been made public.</p>
<p>Dynalife and the Health Sciences Association of Alberta union have until Sept. 25 to come up with a solution under the province's intervention plan.</p>

<p>Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, 67, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has contracted swine flu, becoming the world's first known political leader to have fallen ill with the virus. His brother and chief of staff, Rodrigo Arias, announced the president must remain isolated at home for at least a week, but will not delegate power during that time.</p>

</p>
<p>Viewpoint: Winnipeg Free Press</p>
<p>The annual North American Leaders Summit -- annual, at least, since former United States president George W. Bush inaugurated it in 2005 -- is usually a low-profile, almost casual affair.</p>
<p>The leaders meet, they talk about common concerns, interests and problems, and then amicably agree that something should be done about them sometime soon.</p>
<p>This year's brief get-together by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Mexican President Felipe Calderon and American President Barack Obama was not much different than usual, but some issues stood out with unusual clarity.</p>
<p>One, the recent requirement that Mexican visitors to Canada must have visas, was a purely bilateral affair between the Canadian and Mexican leaders.</p>
<p>Obama was not present for those talks -- indeed, he was not yet in Guadalajara when they took place.</p>
<p>The Mexican government is angry and insulted by the visa requirement imposed by a friend, an ally, a partner in NAFTA. It wants Ottawa to lift the regulation and allow the free flow of people across the border to resume.</p>
<p>The meeting, however, failed to produce any movement. Harper was careful not to impose any blame on Mexico for the situation; rather, he says, it lies solely with the faults and failings of the Canadian refugee system which is far too open in its access and too slow in its deliberations.</p>
<p>This has allowed thousands of Mexicans -- most of whom are not genuine refugees, to clog the works, and has adversely affected the situation of genuine refugees.</p>
<p>Calderon may find that to be cold comfort, particularly since Harper's government appears to have no idea how it will or even can fix the problem.</p>
<p>It is likely to be a thorny issue between the two sides for some time to come.</p>
<p>Another issue concerns everyone, and it topped the agenda after Obama arrived.</p>
<p>The three-way conversation was brief and touched on several topics -- Honduras and trade among them, with the American president adamantly dismissing Canadian concerns about his Buy American policies -- but much of it concentrated on the H1N1 flu and the expected second onslaught of the disease later this year.</p>
<p>They hoped to create a three-nation network of health officials and co-ordinate vaccine and antiviral supplies.</p>
<p>If the three nations hope to deal with a possible epidemic, their common geography and long borders make co-operation crucial.</p>
<p>No specific plans were laid in Guadalajara to battle H1N1, just as none were made to end Buy-American policies or visa requirements, but the three leaders have shown that they can and are willing to work together - at least in some ways.</p>

</p>
<p>Montreal's health and social services sector will be getting a major cash injection in the coming year, Quebec's finance minister announced yesterday.</p>
<p>In a statement, Raymond Bachand said the province is planning to dole out a total of $244.7 million in 2009-2010 to various hospitals, clinics, social services centres and institutes in the Montreal region.</p>
<p>"This (funding) will mean tangible support for health and social services establishments in our region, which will now be better equipped to deliver quality services," Bachand said.</p>
<p>The money, which is being provided in part through the province's five-year plan to improve infrastructure, will be used to upgrade equipment, complete minor renovations, maintain aging buildings and improve accessibility for patients.</p>
<p>The province is also hoping that the cash infusion will better prepare the region's health centres for a possible onslaught of H1N1 flu cases this fall and winter. Equipment used to study the H1N1 virus and other diseases, as well as basic necessities like wheelchairs and stretchers, are considered "a top priority," according to the statement.</p>
<p>Among the biggest beneficiaries are the McGill University Health Centre and the Centre hospitalier de l'université de Montréal, which are slated to receive nearly $42 million and $37 million, respectively.</p>
<p>In total, the Quebec government is spending $402.6 million this year on improvements to health and social services infrastructure across the province.</p>

</p>
<p>A s Alberta confirmed its seventh death related to swine flu Wednesday, Canada's federal health minister warned businesses to prepare for the possibility of a more severe outbreak this fall.</p>
<p>Leona Aglukkaq said many small-and medium-sized firms do not have plans to respond to the H1N1 influenza pandemic, despite the risk it could cause problems like significant employee absenteeism.</p>
<p>In an attempt to address the issue, Ottawa announced a $926,600 contract for the Winnipeg-based International Centre for Infectious Diseases to help smaller Canadian firms prepare for H1N1.</p>
<p>"We know economic or social disruption could occur," said Aglukkaq, at a press conference in Ottawa. "It's crucial that the business world is ready in the event of a more severe second wave of H1N1 in the fall."</p>
<p>Alberta business groups said many smaller companies don't have human resources departments to prepare for H1N1, adding any assistance will help.</p>
<p>"If you're a small-business owner and trying to manage your company, maybe you haven't taken a step back to look at (a plan)," said Janine Halbesma, acting Alberta director of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.</p>
<p>The comments come as Alberta health officials confirmed Wednesday an elderly Edmonton-area man with H1N1 has died.</p>
<p>He is the seventh Albertan with the virus to die.</p>
<p>H1N1 influenza, which first appeared in Mexico this spring and has since been declared a global pandemic, has infected about 1,631 people in this province and more than 10,000 Canadians.</p>
<p>Federal health officials said the virus's spread appears to be slowing slightly, which is expected during the summer months. But experts said the number of H1N1 cases will likely increase during the fall flu season and there is a possibility the virus could return in a more virulent form.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer said influenza is an unpredictable disease and businesses need to consider how they will continue operating in the event a large number of their workers become ill.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones said companies should also be speaking to employees about not coming to work if they are sick and exploring alternatives, like working from home.</p>
<p>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business is recommending businesses consider their essential services and how they could continue in the event staff are sick or supplies are interrupted.</p>
<p>The funding announced Wednesday will help the International Centre for Infectious Diseases identify what resources are already available for small business pandemic planning and develop new products to address any gaps.</p>
<p>Calgary Chamber of Commerce officials noted there are already web-sites to help businesses prepare for a pandemic, but said additional help is welcome.</p>
<p>"Any tool kit that helps small business is a good thing," said Heather Douglas, president and chief executive of the chamber.</p>
<p>She said the level of planning for H1N1 varies among the organization's members, although she said most companies have some kind of plan for business interruption.</p>
<p>At least one Calgary company that has a full pandemic plan said all businesses should take H1N1 seriously, even if it seems like the impact from the virus has been mild so far.</p>
<p>Tom Byttynen, president of Thomas Fresh Inc., said his company has plans that include potentially reducing the number of shifts at the Calgary plant and ensuring employees are cross trained and know how to work in different areas.</p>
<p>"I have a feeling a number of people aren't prepared," said Byttynen, whose medium-sized company grows, packs and ships produce.</p>
<p>"We as North Americans refuse to believe it can happen to us . . . but illness can happen anywhere."</p>
<p>Questions about business pandemic planning came as Aglukkaq met with opposition parties Wednesday at a heated House of Commons health committee meeting.</p>
<p>The minister and opposition MPs have been at odds and trading accusations over how the government has handled the H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>Liberal health critic Carolyn Bennett and New Democratic Party health critic Judy Wasylycia-Leis said the health minister hasn't been visible enough on the file and they have not received the answers they want from her or her officials.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pandemic threatens to strain home care in region; Services could be cut back, limited to 'essential' only</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>718 words</div><div>13 August 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Eastern Ontario's home-care program, already stretched to the limit by a shortage of workers, could be forced to scale back services this fall if a flu pandemic keeps nurses, personal support workers and therapists from making house calls.</p>
<p>In a worst-case scenario, the agency that arranges in-home care for 24,000 Eastern Ontarians a day could cut back services to only what is considered "essential." That means restricting services to those clients deemed to be at highest risk of being admitted to hospital, or developing life-threatening complications.</p>
<p>The Champlain Community Care Access Centre (CCAC) is also warning of potential delays in scheduled home visits during a potential pandemic.</p>
<p>"Things will not be the same," said Brigitte Emes, who's responsible for emergency preparedness at the Champlain CCAC. "The level of service that we provide in normal times will be different in a pandemic."</p>
<p>To minimize the potential of a staffing shortage, non-essential workers, such as therapists, could be reassigned to do frontline work such as wound care, case management or personal support, said Emes.</p>
<p>To date, the number of swine-flu cases reported among home-care workers and their clients has been relatively small, allowing the system to continue running, said Emes.</p>
<p>In contrast, the OC Transpo strike over the winter caused greater disruptions because a large number of home-care workers rely on public transit to reach clients, said Emes.</p>
<p>But a flu pandemic could seriously strain the home-care system at a time when its workers are most needed to look after a potential surge in frail and vulnerable clients who need help bathing, dressing, eating or managing their medications.</p>
<p>The CCAC's pandemic plan assumes that a resurgence of flu this fall, including the regular seasonal flu and the new H1N1 swine flu, could leave up to 30 per cent of the region's 2,950 home-care workers sick and unable to work.</p>
<p>"The premise for our planning is, how are we going to manage to serve the most-in-need client given the resources that we have on any given day," Emes said.</p>
<p>"It's a matter of having to prioritize clients ... We just have so much staff to provide service so we're maxed out."</p>
<p>The agency is urging home-care clients -- the dying, the disabled, hospital patients sent home early and seniors trying to remain in their homes -- to prepare for the fall flu season by talking with family, friends and neighbours about ways they could do some of the work normally done by home-care workers. In most cases, home care supplements the support already being provided by family and friends.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada has issued a similar message, urging Canadians to identify elderly or vulnerable relatives, friends and neighbours who may need help should they get sick with flu this fall.</p>
<p>For home-care clients with family and friends willing to help, training would be provided to ensure, for example, that medications are administered properly, said Emes.</p>
<p>"We will be teaching, as much as possible, other caregivers to be able to do some of the work that we do now," Emes said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, flu screening, which has been in place since late April, is part of the precautions being taken as home-care workers step up infection control and prevention measures.</p>
<p>Home-care clients or members of their households who report flu-like symptoms trigger measures that ensure home-care workers use gowns, gloves, respirators and face shields to protect themselves.</p>
<p>But a potential challenge could arise if a spike in flu cases results in a shortage of protective equipment for home-care workers, making it unsafe for them to work in clients' homes. That could prevent staff from reporting for duty, making an existing staffing crunch even worse, said Emes.</p>
<p>As recommended under the provincial pandemic response plan, the CCAC has stockpiled a four-week supply of protective equipment for its staff, said Emes. But it's unclear whether the actual home-care agencies it hires, the ones that provide frontline services, have followed provincial guidelines and maintained a stockpile of equipment at their own expense.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>The federal government must ensure that frontline municipal workers have access to flu vaccines if there is a difficult outbreak, House of Commons committee heard Wednesday.</p>
<p>The message was delivered by Kitchener Coun. Berry Vrbanovic, a vice-president with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.</p>
<p>"It is essential to ensuring our municipalities can continue to function," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>With the deadly H1N1 virus expected to return in the fall, municipalities want to ensure that critical workers - such as police, firefighters, road crews and transit operators - are able to stay healthy and on the job.</p>
<p>"By doing that, we address the needs of the greater populace," Vrbanovic said.</p>
<p>The federation said a co-ordinated national strategy is required to ensure that workers across the country have timely access to an H1N1 vaccine, antivirals and protective equipment.</p>
<p>"A pandemic does not recognize jurisdictional or political boundaries," Vrbanovic said.</p>
<p>"Canada must not limit itself to a patchwork of regional pandemic responses," he told the standing committee on health.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the government gave $926,600 to Winnipeg's International Centre for Infectious Diseases to develop a pandemic tool kit for small and mid-sized businesses.</p>

<p>Russia vows $500M aid to breakaway region</p>
<p>Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin visited the separatist Georgian region of Abkhazia yesterday, promising to provide nearly $500 million (U.S.) in military aid.</p>
<p>Putin's visit came on the anniversary of the ceasefire in last year's war with Georgia, during which Russian troops and separatist forces ousted Georgian forces from the territory of Abkhazia and another breakaway Georgian province, South Ossetia. After the war, Russia recognized both regions as independent.</p>
<p>The Georgian Foreign Ministry strongly protested Putin's trip as "yet another attempt to destabilize the situation and escalate the tension in the Caucasus region."</p>

<p>Supporters of ousted president Manuel Zelaya clashed with soldiers and police for a second day yesterday as street protests over the June 28 army coup turned rowdy.</p>
<p>Security forces fired tear gas to disperse a crowd of thousands of demonstrators in the capital Tegucigalpa and protesters responded by throwing stones in a scuffle near Congress. The demonstration calmed down by the afternoon.</p>

<p>Schools, cinemas closed in bid to control H1N1</p>
<p>All schools, colleges and movie theatres in Mumbai will be closed temporarily beginning today in a bid to contain the spread of the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Schools and colleges will remain shut for a week in the city of 18 million people, officials said yesterday, while cinemas will be closed for three days. Health officials say there are more than 1,000 confirmed cases of swine flu across the country.</p>

<p>insurgents' jungle camps</p>
<p>Hundreds of soldiers attacked two jungle encampments of Al Qaeda-linked insurgents yesterday, killing at least 20 gunmen and seizing bombs that had been set to explode, military officials said. Twenty-three soldiers were also killed.</p>
<p>The simultaneous, pre-dawn attacks on two Abu Sayyaf encampments in hilly Silangkum and Baguindan villages on Basilan Island sparked fierce fighting.</p>

<p>Residents of Mezzema banged on pot and lids after the village church bells were silenced this month following a tourist's complaint about the 7 a.m. gonging.</p>
<p>The noisy protests, which occurred for a few days, were enough to get the church bells chiming again yesterday. Anna Daneri, who led the protest, said the sound of the bells "keeps the elderly company," and is a tradition of the centuries-old village near La Spezia, northern Italy.</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- Manitoba Conservative MP Joy Smith threatened twice to suspend a special meeting of the parliamentary health committee Wednesday that was rife with tension.</p>
<p>Liberal and NDP MPs had called for the meeting, saying they fear Canadians have not been given enough information about what they are to do if a major outbreak of H1N1 hits this fall.</p>
<p>But Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, Smith and other Conservatives accused the opposition parties of using the public health threat to score political points. Aglukkaq said Wednesday she was "disappointed" in the opposition parties, noting they had unprecedented access to meetings with her weekly or biweekly since H1N1 first appeared in April.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq did appear at the meeting but after 45 minutes Smith announced the health minister had to go, which left Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett and Winnipeg NDP MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis incensed.</p>
<p>"I didn't know the minister had something more pressing she had to do," snapped Bennett. "This is unsatisfactory for us to be treated like this as parliamentarians." She said Smith should have let the committee know Aglukkaq had time constraints because they might have reorganized their questions.</p>
<p>She raised a point of order to demand Aglukkaq immediately agree to appear next week for at least an hour.</p>
<p>When Smith overruled her point, Bennett erupted, prompting Smith to lay down her first warning.</p>
<p>"I will suspend this meeting," she said, warning Bennett her behaviour was inappropriate considering the importance of the subject matter before the committee.</p>
<p>Not long after that, it was Smith and Wasylycia-Leis going head to head when Wasylycia-Leis attempted to sneak in an extra question to chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>When Wasylycia-Leis tried to speak over Smith's interjections, Smith banged her gavel.</p>
<p>"We are going to have to suspend until we can get some order," she said sharply.</p>
<p>Later, Wasylycia-Leis said she was shocked Aglukkaq left so quickly, though the MPs did agree to try to resume the committee as soon as possible to ask Aglukkaq about H1N1 planning for First Nations.</p>
<p>Wasylycia-Leis said she expected by now specific details of the plan would be ready, giving Canadians advice on everything from whether the vaccine is safe to who should wear a mask and when.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq repeated over and over again that the plan will be ready in time.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones seemed to be barely containing impatience at suggestions he and the government are not working hard enough during the summer on H1N1 preparations.</p>
<p>He likened the work to being like a duck which is calm on the surface but paddling like heck under the water and said it is not a concern that Canada hasn't yet released a priority list for who will get antiviral medications or the vaccine for H1N1 first.</p>
<p>"We don't need to prioritize antivirals because we have enough for everybody to get antivirals," he said. He added the priority list for who will get the vaccine first will be ready in September and the vaccine itself won't be ready in Canada until November.</p>
<p>The government has placed a $17-million order for 50.4 million doses of the vaccine, so every Canadian who wants to be vaccinated can be.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq also said she will next week be ready to release guidelines for how schools should handle an outbreak including advice on whether they should be closed if a lot of students fall ill.</p>

<p>Focus on Winnipeg</p>
<p>WINNIPEG is becoming the hub of Canada's final preparations to battle an outbreak of H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, said Winnipeg will be the site of a meeting Sept. 2-3 of professionals who have dealt with H1N1 so far, including infectious disease experts and intensive care doctors who treated patients with severe illness.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq will meet her provincial and territorial counterparts in the city for an H1N1 planning session to finalize their roles and plans for a potential outbreak.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg-based International Centre for Infectious Diseases was also given a $926,600 contract Wednesday to develop plans to help small businesses in Canada create pandemic plans to help keep them running in the event of a major outbreak.</p>
<p>Winnipeg is the home of the Public Health Agency of Canada. The virology lab at PHAC's headquarters on Arlington Street played a critical role helping identify the H1N1 virus in its early stages.</p>

<p>First Nations people living in remote communities in Manitoba will be high on the list for the first rounds of vaccinations this fall to protect against the second wave of the H1N1 swine flu virus.</p>
<p>Manitoba Health Minister Theresa Oswald said Wednesday the province will release its own priority list of who should be vaccinated as early as the end of the month, likely before the federal Public Health Agency of Canada issues its own list.</p>
<p>"We feel the need to move swiftly on this," Oswald said in an interview as she laid out Manitoba's plans for Round 2 of its battle with the flu.</p>
<p>"Manitoba's approach will be that the people in Manitoba who need and or want the vaccine will get it. That's a universal approach to administering the vaccine."</p>
<p>A school-based vaccination program is part of planning discussions, but Oswald said it is not recommended at this point.</p>

<p>Re: Swine flu reveals fatal flaw, Aug. 4 guest column by Jaro Kotalik.</p>
<p>I would like to point out the steps that the Ontario government has taken in regards to pandemic planning.</p>
<p>As part of its preparedness efforts, under the lead of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, the government has developed the Ontario Health Plan for an Influenza Pandemic. The plan provides useful preparedness guidance and response tools for all components of the health system, including primary care, acute care, public health, and emergency medical services.</p>
<p>As part of the plan, the ministry has developed a comprehensive pandemic procurement strategy that includes:</p>
<p>- Maintenance of a stockpile of antiviral drugs sufficient to treat 25 per cent of Ontarians during a pandemic.</p>
<p>- Distribution of emergency infection control kits containing a 10-day supply of Personal Protective Equipment for approximately 15,000 front-line community health practitioner offices.</p>
<p>- Creation of a ministry stockpile of PPE for the health sector, as well as mass vaccination supplies.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the article, we recognize that there is the potential for an increase in the demand for ventilators and other critical care resources, depending on the severity of the illness. The province tracks more than 1,100 critical care beds capable of supporting mechanical ventilation and a 2006 inventory identified more than 8,000 ventilators in the province.</p>
<p>A planning process is currently underway to review our needs for the fall, including supplies and equipment. The ministry is closely monitoring the severity of illnesses caused by the H1N1 virus. If the need were to arise, the Ontario Health Plan for an Influenza Pandemic is flexible enough to respond to a surge in demand for critical care resources.</p>
<p>In closing, I would like to point out that Ontario has been recognized both nationally and internationally as a leader in pandemic planning through its work on the OHPIP.</p>

<p>Members of the House of Commons health committee will gather today for a midsummer meeting at the request of opposition MPs who are critical of the government's handling of the swine flu pandemic.</p>
<p>"We need to be able to raise a lot of questions and get a sense of where the government stands on a number of key issues," said Judy Wasylycia-Leis, the New Democratic Party's health critic.</p>
<p>She is one of four opposition MPs who requested the committee undertake a study of the government's pandemic plans. Procedural rules dictate the committee must be convened within five working days of such a request, which meant members were making last-minute travel arrangements to Ottawa, or finding other MPs to send in their place if they had previous commitments.</p>
<p>The meeting could prove to be a short one, depending on how the 12 committee members -- six Conservatives and six opposition members -- vote on the proposal to conduct an in-depth review of the pandemic plans. The meeting is expected to go ahead, however, and the committee has lined up several witnesses, including Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>Wasylycia-Leis, and her Liberal counterpart, Carolyn Bennett, have both been critical of the health minister's leadership abilities.</p>
<p>Wasylycia-Leis said Aglukkaq "started off on a strong foot" when the pandemic began in the spring but that she has been "noticeably absent" since Parliament rose for the summer.</p>
<p>"We've got to have leadership from the government and I can't say that I've seen that kind of leadership from Leona Aglukkaq over the last several months when in fact we should be at the height of planning," she said. "This should be the period of time when we put all efforts into both planning and keeping in touch with the public."</p>
<p>Bennett, who sent a letter to the health minister on behalf of the Liberals in July telling her she was being too silent, denied accusations from the chair of the committee, Conservative Joy Smith, that opposition members are "playing politics" with an important health issue.</p>
<p>"We are very concerned that this must not be seen to be any political game. We have a responsibility as parliamentarians to make sure we're ready for the fall. We're doing our job," said Bennett. "It is very worrying that anybody would think this is anything more than trying to be constructive and trying to go forward, and taking our responsibility very seriously."</p>
<p>Bennett said the committee is mandated to oversee the government's pandemic preparedness plan and that holding a meeting when Parliament resumes in late September is too late to ensure plans are on track for the fall flu season when the pandemic is expected to worsen.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the health minister said the government is sharing information and that Aglukkaq has held 15 press conferences, developed public information campaigns, and shared guidelines with health care workers.</p>

<p>An Alberta government report suggests the West Nile virus might be far more widespread in Canada than the official numbers suggest.</p>
<p>The Alberta government report estimates West Nile infected more than 20,000 Albertans in the first three years after the virus appeared in the province in 2003 -- and the vast majority of victims apparently showed no symptoms.</p>
<p>While the results may seem surprising -- given that only about 650 Albertans have tested positive for the disease since 2003 -- experts said many who contract the virus likely don't get tested for it.</p>
<p>The internal government report based its estimate of the total provincial infection rate on West Nile antibodies found in nearly 2,000 blood samples.</p>
<p>"Twenty thousand cases is a pretty reasonable guess," said Don Schopflocher of the University of Alberta, who analyzed the data for the provincial study.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of people who contract the West Nile virus but only a small proportion who get ill enough to consult physicians."</p>
<p>The report comes during the normal peak of West Nile season, although a cool wet summer across Canada has experts saying 2009 will be a slow year for the virus.</p>
<p>No human cases have been reported anywhere in the country this summer.</p>
<p>West Nile can cause encephalitis, a fatal inflammation of the brain, or a deadly inflammation of the membranes covering the brain or spinal cord (meningitis).</p>
<p>There were 2,215 human cases of West Nile reported in Canada in 2007.</p>
<p>But by 2008 the Canadian caseload had fallen precipitously, to just 36.</p>
<p>"I think we're seeing two processes here," said Schopflocher, an associate professor and researcher in the nursing faculty.</p>
<p>"We're seeing an ebb and flow in terms of infection, and 2009 may be a particularly low year for West Nile because of the weather.</p>
<p>"Also, the virus may be becoming endemic in the population -- in other words, people may be developing antibodies. Really, we don't know very much about West Nile. I know there are people at Health Canada who are very concerned about this."</p>
<p>Schopflocher suggested that the experience with West Nile might mirror the behaviour of the H1N1 flu virus to date.</p>
<p>"It may echo the situation with H1N1, where it's often the case that only those with pre-existing illnesses and conditions get seriously ill," he said.</p>
<p>"The conclusion we can draw from this is that, in the time since West Nile first became known in North America, it turns out to not be as virulent as we might have expected."</p>

<p>“While bullish, I continue to try to balance the need to respect the historically weak seasonal trends that late summer typically brings while, at the same time, being cognizant that market breadth remains extremely bullish regardless of the seasonal cycle.

The market surge of the past five months has been a celebration of the government's success in staving off financial doom. Stocks deserved to rise from panic lows.”</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>A new commentary in a medical journal suggests the world may be making unfounded assumptions about what's to come with swine flu because of misunderstandings about what happened in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.</p>
<p>The authors, including one whose team found and sequenced the 1918 virus, says evidence that the Spanish flu started mild and then rose in virulence is not strong.</p>
<p>They say that while many people believe there was a so-called herald wave of milder illness in the spring of 1918, there is no biological proof the spring outbreak was caused by the same virus that ripped through the Northern Hemisphere in the fall of 1918.</p>
<p>The authors, from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, say they studied accounts of about 14 pandemic-like events dating back to 1510 and see no evidence the viruses caused waves of infections.</p>
<p>They say newly emerged flu viruses quickly moved into the pattern of seasonal flu, with the new virus returning more or less on an annual basis.</p>
<p>One of the authors, Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger, says each pandemic is unique and people should not assume this one is going to follow the pattern of the 1918 outbreak.</p>

<p>Calgary schools are dusting off their pandemic plans as they prepare for the fall school year and the return of the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>The Calgary Board of Education and Calgary Catholic School District said Tuesday they have been revising and updating their plans over the summer, while some post-secondary institutions have been installing hand sanitizers on campus and preparing education campaigns for students.</p>
<p>"There's quite a bit of planning underway," said Grady Semmens, the University of Calgary's associate director of media relations.</p>
<p>"We're looking forward to the beginning of the school year and (preparing for) the possibility we could be facing a rising number of cases of H1N1."</p>
<p>The preparations come as experts anticipate an increase this fall in the number of cases of the so-called swine flu virus, which first appeared in Mexico during the spring and has since been declared a global pandemic.</p>
<p>At the university, Semmens said staff are focusing on communicating with students and raising awareness about what to do if they feel ill.</p>
<p>Posters about proper hand-washing techniques are going up around campus and hand sanitizer stations are being installed in high-traffic areas.</p>
<p>SAIT Polytechnic is taking a similar approach with posters and hand sanitizer units on campus.</p>
<p>"We're also continuing to disinfect all public surface areas on a regular basis," said SAIT spokeswoman Heidi Sparks.</p>
<p>Catholic school administrators said they have been updating the pandemic plan they've had in place for years.</p>
<p>"Since the H1N1 issue has come about, we are making revisions to (our plan) in anticipation of any potential issues that might arise in the fall," said Janet Sutherland, spokeswoman for the school district.</p>
<p>The Calgary Board of Education, meanwhile, has been holding regular meetings to monitor H1N1 and prepare for the school year.</p>
<p>It's not yet clear, however, what policy the two boards will implement around school closures in the face of outbreaks at facilities.</p>
<p>CBE spokesman Ted Flitton said it's too early to comment on that issue.</p>
<p>The new president of the Alberta Teachers' Association said school administrators should base decisions about closures on advice from health authorities. "The policy must be built on good medical evidence," said Carol Henderson. "(Closing schools) has to be about the health of teachers and students."</p>
<p>Henderson also expressed concern that school boards have been slowly cutting back on custodial services, arguing clean schools could help prevent the spread of viruses.</p>

<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Older is better when it comes to fighting the swine flu, Waterloo Region's associate medical officer of health said Tuesday.</p>
<p>But this older population remains at greater risk of getting the regular flu, and becoming seriously ill or dying from it, said Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang.</p>
<p>"For most people over the age of 60, it is very rare that they are getting" the H1N1 flu, she said in an interview.</p>
<p>The general feeling, she said, is this age group may have acquired immunity to the H1N1 virus because of previous exposure to a variation of this strain.</p>
<p>People under 20 do not have this immunity and that may be why the rate of swine-flu illness is highest in this age group, she said.</p>
<p>As of Friday, there have been 36 confirmed cases of H1N1 in Waterloo Region, the vast majority reported in healthy young adults, Wang said. Four new cases were reported last week.</p>
<p>Locally, seven people have been hospitalized and there have been no deaths. All cases have been mild-to-moderate. In Ontario, the number of confirmed cases is 3,983, and there have been 21 deaths.</p>
<p>Wang said while the numbers of local cases have been decreasing over the past several weeks, it is still uncommon for a flu outbreak to occur in the summer.</p>

<p>Pakistan</p>
<p>Nuclear bases targeted three times, expert says</p>
<p>The country's nuclear weapon bases have been attacked by Al Qaeda and the Taliban at least three times in the last two years, a leading British security expert alleges.</p>
<p>Prof. Shaun Gregory, of Bradford University, said militants struck a nuclear storage facility at Sarghoda on Nov. 1, 2007; launched a suicide bomb assault on a nuclear air base at Kamra on Dec. 10, 2007; and set off explosions at entrance points to Wah Cantonment Ordnance Complex, one of Pakistan's main nuclear assembly plants, in August 2008, killing 63 people.</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>Ex-WWII officer, 90, convicted of massacre</p>
<p>A 90-year-old former German army officer was sentenced to life in prison yesterday for ordering the massacre of 10 Italian civilians in a World War II reprisal killing.</p>
<p>The Munich state court convicted Josef Scheungraber on 10 counts of murder and one of attempted murder, 65 years after soldiers under his command herded 11 Italians into a barn and blew it up, killing everyone but a teenage boy. The court ruled Scheungraber's men exacted vengeance against the population of Falzano di Cortona, after local partisans killed two German soldiers in June 1944.</p>
<p>Scheungraber's lawyer said he would appeal, a process that could take several months. Scheungraber will remain free until it is over.</p>
<p>Afghanistan</p>
<p>Canadians seize arms, materials for bombs</p>
<p>Canadian soldiers in Kandahar have finished one of their largest operations so far this year, aimed at harassing the Taliban out of a key area south of Kandahar city.</p>
<p>The four-day Operation Constrictor in the violent Panjwaii district netted a cache of weapons and bomb-making materials. The area borders the Dand district, where Canadians have built a "model village" project.</p>

<p>Mayor offers pardon</p>
<p>to civil rights protesters</p>
<p>The mayor of Birmingham, Ala., offered a blanket pardon yesterday to thousands of demonstrators charged in this cauldron of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, a mostly symbolic forgiveness he acknowledges few may actually want.</p>
<p>Many blacks who braved police dogs and fire hoses say they carry their misdemeanour record as a badge of honour. Mayor Larry Langford said he expects many will reject the pardon for that reason, but felt it was important to offer.</p>
<p>Indonesia</p>
<p>Man killed in siege</p>
<p>not among most wanted</p>
<p>Indonesian police say DNA tests show the body of a suspected terrorist killed in a 16-hour siege last week is not one of the region's most wanted men.</p>
<p>Police said the man was not Noordin Muhammad Top, despite early media reports that he may have been slain.</p>
<p>Noordin, a Malaysian, has been blamed for a series of deadly attacks in Indonesia since 2003 and is the prime suspect in the twin suicide hotel bombings in Jakarta on July 17 that killed seven people.</p>
<p>The man killed in Central Java was identified as Ibrohim, who is believed to have been the inside man on the hotel attacks.</p>

<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>MONA LISA SMILES ON AFTER TEACUP ATTACK</p>
<p>PARIS -- An "unhinged" Russian woman threw a teacup at the world's most famous painting, Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, but it emerged unscathed due to its bulletproof glass cover, the Louvre museum said Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The young woman took a cup out of her bag and threw it over the heads of other people who were looking at the painting. The cup smashed on the bullet-proof glass which was slightly scratched," a spokesman said.</p>
<p>"It looks like it was done by someone who was unhinged and wanted to draw attention to herself," he said.</p>
<p>The woman put up no resistance when museum guards apprehended her after the incident on Aug. 2.</p>
<p>She was handed over to police who said the woman "did not have all her mental faculties and has been transferred to the police psychiatric infirmary."</p>
<p>The Louvre, the biggest art museum in the world, has thousands of paintings, but most of the millions of visitors a year make a beeline for the Mona Lisa, known in France as La Joconde.</p>
<p>The 500-year-old painting was stolen in 1911 from the Louvre but was returned after an Italian was arrested for its theft two years later.</p>
<p>It was doused with acid by a vandal in 1956 and later the same year a Bolivian damaged it again by throwing a rock at it.</p>
<p>MEN SOUGHT AFTER MASSIVE JEWEL HEIST</p>
<p>LONDON -- Police released pictures on Tuesday of two men wanted in connection with one of Britain's biggest gem heists -- a US$69-million armed raid on a luxury jewellers in London in which shots were fired.</p>
<p>The smartly dressed duo went into Graff Jewellers in the upmarket Mayfair district last Thursday afternoon, threatened staff with handguns and briefly took a female member of staff hostage.</p>
<p>They took 43 items -- rings, bracelets, necklaces and watches together valued at $65 million and fired a shot as they left the premises. The staff member was left outside the shop and no one was injured.</p>
<p>Detective said the robbers made their getaway in a blue <span class="companylink">BMW</span>, which they abandoned a few streets away when a second shot was fired into the ground.</p>
<p>The men then switched to a silver Mercedes and, in another swap shortly afterwards, several suspects got into a black car in a nearby road.</p>
<p>"This was a well planned robbery with a number of vehicles used to help the robbers escape," said Det. Chief Inspector Pam Mace. "These men are extremely dangerous and fired at least two shots in busy London streets as they made their getaway."</p>
<p>Media reports said the raid was thought to be Britain's biggest jewel robbery.</p>
<p>In 2003, an eastern European crime syndicate carried out a $35-million diamond raid at Graff's. Two members of the gang were later jailed for 20 years for their roles in the raid.</p>
<p>OCEANIA</p>
<p>HERO DOG GUIDED RESCUERS TO BODY</p>
<p>SYDNEY, Australia -- A mongrel has proven that dogs really are man's best friend when he helped rescuers find the body of his owner who was killed in a car crash in Australia.</p>
<p>Moja, a small mixed breed, was in the truck with his owner Henry Drew when it crashed off a highway in Queensland and landed in dense shrubs.</p>
<p>The animal sat by Drew's body, which was hidden by trees, barking incessantly for two days until a farmer went to investigate the cause of the noise.</p>
<p>"If it was not for the man's dog, he may not have been found for some time because his truck was completely covered by trees and our helicopter couldn't see it," a spokesperson for AGL Action Rescue told Reuters.</p>
<p>Drew had been reported missing by his wife after he did not answer his cellphone. Rescue helicopters worked with police to search for the him until the farmer called.</p>
<p>ASIA</p>
<p>BOMB KILLS NINE AFGHANS ON BUS</p>
<p>KABUL -- A bomb tore into a minibus killing nine Afghan civilians Tuesday, while a Polish and three U.S. soldiers died in attacks that have spiralled just over a week before elections.</p>
<p>The Taliban-led insurgency against the U.S.-backed government and estimated 100,000 foreign troops has accelerated, raising concerns about whether Aug. 20 presidential and provincial council elections can take place peacefully.</p>
<p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
<p>EIGHT DIE IN IRAQ BOMB ATTACKS</p>
<p>BAGHDAD -- At least eight people were killed and 45 were wounded in bomb attacks in the capital Baghdad and central Iraq on Tuesday, officials said.</p>
<p>In the worst attack, eight people were killed and 30 injured in bombings in the eastern Baghdad neighbourhood of Al-Amin, an interior ministry official told AFP, requesting anonymity.</p>
<p>Two car bombs, one near a cafe and another outside an apartment complex, exploded within five minutes of each other in the mixed Shiite-Christian neighbourhood, the official said.</p>
<p>Nine people were also wounded when a car bomb exploded in a market in the Shaab suburb of northeast Baghdad, the official said.</p>
<p>RAPED GIRL KILLED OVER FAMILY 'HONOUR'</p>
<p>AMMAN, Jordan -- A 41-year-old Jordanian man was charged with premeditated murder after his raped teenage niece was shot dead on Tuesday to "cleanse" the family's honour, police said.</p>
<p>"The man was arrested and charged after he shot the 16-year-old girl eight times in different parts of her body," in the Nasser area east of Amman, a police source told AFP.</p>
<p>"The suspect, who was arrested while carrying his gun, confessed to the crime, saying that he wanted to cleanse his family's honour after his niece was raped last year.</p>
<p>"She gave birth to a baby boy two months ago and her family kept the child."</p>
<p>Murder is punishable by the death penalty in Jordan, but in the case of so-called "honour killings," a court usually commutes or reduces sentences, particularly if the victim's family urges leniency.</p>
<p>Between 15 and 20 women are murdered each year in Jordan in the name of honour, despite government efforts to fight such crimes.</p>
<p>Parliament has refused to reform the penal code to ensure harsher penalties.</p>
<p>RABBIS FIGHT SWINE FLU THEIR WAY</p>
<p>JERUSALEM -- Dozens of rabbis and Kabbalah mystics armed with ceremonial trumpets have taken to the skies over Israel to battle the H1N1 flu virus, Israeli media said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>About 50 Jewish holy men chanted prayers and blew ritual rams' horns known as shofars in an aircraft circling over the country in the hope of stopping the spread of the virus, some of those involved in Monday's venture were quoted as saying.</p>
<p>"The aim of the flight was to stop the pandemic so people will stop dying from it," rabbi Yitzhak Batzri told the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, which carried a picture of the bearded men praying while airborne.</p>
<p>"We are certain that, thanks to the prayer, the danger is already behind us," added Batzri, who could not be reached for further comment on Tuesday.</p>

</p>
<p>There's a bit of a transatlantic spat going on over the antiviral drug Tamiflu. A systematic review in the British Medical Journal, prepared by some of the leading figures in evidence-based medicine in the U. K., suggests that there is probably not much point in giving Tamiflu to children to prevent or treat H1N1 swine flu. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) offered an unimpressed response, noting that the evidence in the BMJ paper is indirect; all of the trials good enough to meet the reviewers' standards involved other strains of H1H1. PHAC says it will continue to recommend Tamiflu for treatment and phrophylaxis in very young infants.</p>
<p>The important thing for parents and caregivers to understand is that this is a low-stakes disagreement. If Tamiflu were a magical cure-all, or if the swine flu had turned out to be worse than ordinary seasonal flu, the debate would be more urgent. But for all the agitation over Tamiflu stockpiles, it seems clear that Tamiflu's benefits are somewhat marginal and, conversely, that the drug is fairly safe. (The Japanese gobble it like Tic Tacs, and don't seem to have any trouble.)</p>
<p>In an inherent vacuum of information about Tamiflu's effect on swine flu specifically, the opinion of any one doctor is likely to come down to personal style -- i. e., his predisposition toward either prescribing conservatively or taking preventive action where something can be done. Parenting styles break down much the same way. And in this case, parents can feel confident giving some weight to their own philosophy.</p>

<p>An Aug. 11 headline with an article on the use of antiviral drugs in children for influenza incorrectly identified the procedure as a flu shot. In fact, the article is referring to pills, liquids or inhalers used to treat the flu or prevent the flu. 20090812</p>
<p>A scientific review published yesterday questions the merits of the broad use of antiviral drugs in children suffering from influenza. The paper, published in the journal BMJ, analyzed studies looking at the drugs' efficacy in children and suggested they are unlikely to prevent complications in those who have seasonal flu.</p>
<p>The authors of the review acknowledged it is unclear whether the findings hold true for the treatment or prevention of infection with the H1N1 pandemic virus, but the limited impact of the drugs on seasonal flu suggests a more conservative approach to pandemic use.</p>
<p>The analysis reviewed studies on the use of these drugs in children, finding only seven. Four related to treatment and three looked at their use to prevent infection.</p>
<p>The accumulated evidence suggests - as with adults - the drugs cut the length of a bout of flu by between a half-day and 1.5 days.</p>
<p>Whether use of the drugs lowered the risk of hospitalization or death was not analyzed.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Obama downplays U. S. protectionism at summit; Also tries to defuse controversy over portrayal of canadian health-care system by opponents</b>
</div><div>Andrew Mayeda   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>830 words</div><div>11 August 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>U. S. President Barack Obama on Monday downplayed the threat to Canadians posed by Buy American policies while rejecting the notion that Canada should be seen as a health-care "bogeyman."</p>
<p>The Buy American policy, which requires that U. S. suppliers use American-made materials in economic recovery projects, has cast a chill over Canadian exporters and provoked fears of U. S. protectionism.</p>
<p>But as he wrapped up a summit here Monday with Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Mexican President Felipe Calderon, Obama called for cooler heads.</p>
<p>"It's important to keep it in perspective that, in fact, we have not seen some sweeping steps towards protectionism," Obama told reporters at the close of the two-day Three Amigos summit.</p>
<p>He noted that the Buy American policy has so far only been put into law in his country's$787-billion US stimulus bill, although other legislation working its way through Congress contains similar provisions. He also said the policy doesn't run afoul of his country's obligations as a member of the World Trade Organization.</p>
<p>"It was not something that I thought was necessary, but it was introduced at a time when we had a very severe economic situation, and it was important for us to act quickly and not get bogged down in debates around this particular provision," Obama added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the president tried to defuse controversy over the portrayal of Canada's public health-care system by opponents of the Obama administration's health reforms.</p>
<p>In a recent television commercial sponsored by a conservative U. S. lobby group, an Ontario woman describes how she travelled to an Arizona clinic for brain surgery due to long wait times in her home province.</p>
<p>"I suspect that you Canadians will continue to get dragged in by those who oppose reform, even though I've said nothing about Canadian health care," said Obama. "I don't find Canadians particularly scary, but I guess some of the opponents of reform think they make a good bogeyman."</p>
<p>Obama has been pushing both houses of Congress to pass a health-care reform bill that would require all Americans to obtain health insurance. However, the president emphasized that the new model that emerges will be "uniquely American."</p>
<p>"I said that the Canadian model works for Canada, it would not work for the United States, in part, simply because we've evolved differently," he said.</p>
<p>Harper, who lambasted the Canadian public health-care system before becoming prime minister, steered clear of the issue.</p>
<p>As has become habitual at the annual Three Amigos Summit, the leaders touted the close co-operation among the three NAFTA partners, while seeking to smooth over irritants in their bilateral relationships.</p>
<p>Harper came to Guadalajara hoping to ease Mexican concerns over the federal government's imposition of visas on all Mexican nationals entering Canada.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the prime minister shifted the blame for the decision to Canada's refugee system, which he said allows for too many bogus claims.</p>
<p>Calderon said his government would work with Canada to prevent abuses of the refugee system, but he did not hide his displeasure with the new visa rules.</p>
<p>"We've talked openly, frankly, and certainly Mexico feels very bad about this decision..., but it certainly gets in the way of a good relationship," said the Mexican president.</p>
<p>On the Buy American front, Harper said he was "happy" to see the provinces and territories pledge last week to support the federal government's efforts to fight protectionism.</p>
<p>The premiers backed the concept of a procurement agreement with the U. S. in which the provinces would agree not to retaliate in exchange for an exemption from Washington.</p>
<p>But Harper also made it clear that negotiations with the Americans are still underway, suggesting the next opportunity for a breakthrough could come when he makes his first official visit to the Obama White House on Sept. 16.</p>
<p>"Our respective trade ministers have been talking, officials are talking, and I anticipate that President Obama and I will be discussing this at greater length in our upcoming meetings," the prime minister said.</p>
<p>After the summit, Harper heads to Panama, where he is expected to sign a free-trade agreement with Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli.</p>
<p>It will be the first time a Canadian prime minister has visited Panama.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pork producers struggling to bring home the bacon; Poor barbecue weather sends prices down, worsening catastrophic season for farmers</b>
</div><div>PATRICK WHITE </div>
<div>795 words</div><div>11 August 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>WINNIPEG -- From hog barn to barbecue grill, this has been a summer without sizzle.</p>
<p>As cool weather persists throughout the Prairies, Ontario and the Maritimes, barbecue grills gather dust. Briquette bags remain sealed. Grocery store displays of Montreal steak spice go untouched.</p>
<p>And Anna Tomeczkowicz can't move any pork chops.</p>
<p>“Nobody is barbecuing in this weather,” she said from her family's Toronto butcher shop, Spring Creek Farm Produce. “We are selling much less of all the grill meats.”</p>
<p>As if Canada's hog farmers needed any more bad news.</p>
<p>Fewer chops on the grill translates into lower prices for pigs, compounding an anxious year of catastrophic losses for pig producers that has persuaded many to sell the farm.</p>
<p>“Based on present market, we may have to close the doors by mid-September or October,” said Manitoba farmer Bill Vaags. “We'd have to sell all the stock. Some of the pregnant sows might have to be aborted. It's a sad story.”</p>
<p>Particularly sad given Mr. Vaags's standing among pork producers. Former president of the Canadian Pork Council and member of the Manitoba Agricultural Hall of Fame, he's been raising hogs in the province since 1961. In that time, he's never seen it so bad.</p>
<p>Barbecue season normally brings a seasonal spike somewhere around $1.50 a kilogram. Because of high feed prices, Mr. Vaags needs at least $1.30 to break even.</p>
<p>As of last week he was looking at $1.07, a price that's plummeted more than 20 per cent in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The blow wouldn't be so bad if he had some cash on hand. The past two years have been so lean that the 73-year-old says he's burned through most of his retirement fund.</p>
<p>“We weren't exactly sitting pretty for retirement before,” he said. “But now so much money is gone, we're looking at surviving totally off of meagre pensions.”</p>
<p>Various forces are conspiring against Canada's hog farmers. New U.S. laws surrounding country-of-origin labelling have changed American meat-buying habits, and the rising loonie – now sitting over 92 cents compared with the U.S. dollar – has made all Canadian exports less competitive.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, some say the industry took too long to persuade consumers they wouldn't catch the H1N1 flu from eating pork.</p>
<p>The result is an industry on the wane. More than 3,300 hog producers have left hog farming since 2006. Many of those who remain are having difficulty bearing the strain.</p>
<p>“We're hearing from farmers who are not eating, not sleeping, not talking to spouses, having arguments with children and neighbours,” said Janet Smith, program manager of the Manitoba Farm and Rural Stress Line. “We've seen more calls from hog producers than we ever have.”</p>
<p>The Canadian Pork Council has requested an $800-million loan from Ottawa on behalf of farmers, but Agriculture Canada has yet to make it clear what kind of special assistance it may offer the industry.</p>
<p>Until federal help arrives, some producers will scrounge for feed. “We are really struggling to feed the pigs,” said Jurgen Preugschas, president of the Canadian Pork Council. “… When your top producers are losing extreme amounts of money and producers are having nervous breakdowns, it's serious.”</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>IT'S TOO LATE FOR RAINSTORMS TO SAVE PARCHED CROPS</p>
<p>Several rainstorms throughout drought-plagued regions of Alberta and Saskatchewan have greened farmers' fields, if not their wallets.</p>
<p>Since July 1, three storms ended what was shaping up to be the worst drought in 80 years throughout western Saskatchewan and south-central Alberta, but they came too late to save parched crops.</p>
<p>“If it all comes late in the season, what's the use?” said Daniel Itenfisu, drought modeller with Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p>Despite the rain, the Alberta government has classified 34 per cent of cereal crops as “poor,” and just 1 per cent as “excellent.”</p>
<p>In western Saskatchewan, insurance adjusters had already written off many crops by the time the rain fell.</p>
<p>And throughout the affected region, cattle producers were already thinning their herds.</p>
<p>“The pasture land is no good this year,” Mr. Itenfisu said.</p>
<p>While the rain may be helping late crops along, the temperature is not. It has been unseasonably cold throughout the Prairies this summer. Parts of western Saskatchewan plummeted to one degree last week and with so many crops getting a late start, frost is sure to become an issue come harvest.</p>
<p>“This has not been a good season,” Mr. Itenfisu said. “And that won't change.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canada's agenda hurt by visa spat</b>

</p>
<p>If Prime Minister Stephen Harper hoped to wring an expression of sympathy from U.S. President Barack Obama on the troublesome "Buy America" issue at the Three Amigos summit in Guadalajara yesterday, he must have left sadly disappointed.</p>
<p>Obama did tip Harper a backhanded compliment for raising U.S. protectionism "every time" they meet. The president also mused that "there may be mechanisms" through which provinces and states can harmonize cross-border procurement policies. But beyond that, he gave no ground.</p>
<p>Canadians should keep the Buy America provisions of Washington's $787 billion stimulus program "in perspective," Obama retorted. He shrugged off worries that it amounts to "sweeping" protectionism, though it bars Canadian suppliers from bidding on highways, bridges and other infrastructure. The move has "in no way endangered the billions of dollars in trade between our two countries," he insisted.</p>
<p>That remains to be seen. Yet whatever the ultimate damage, Canadians have reason to be offended by this spasm of protectionism from our chief trade partner, at a time when Obama, Harper and Mexican President Felipe Calderon are promising to "avoid protectionist measures" and to work together to restore growth. Nor are Canadians alone in feeling the U.S. protectionist sting. Calderon has imposed retaliation on behalf of Mexican truckers, who also are hurting.</p>
<p>Given these strains, the conditions were ideal at the fifth North American Leaders' Summit for Harper and Calderon to join forces (despite their different economic agendas) and make a strong public pitch to Obama to exempt us from these irritants. It didn't happen.</p>
<p>Instead, Harper spent much of his time scrambling to mend fences with Calderon after angering Mexicans by suddenly slapping visa restrictions on them last month. Almost apologetically, Harper faulted not Mexican authorities but Canada's refugee law, which he said "encourages bogus claimants." He praised Calderon to the skies for battling the drug cartels. And he offered Mounties to train the Mexican police to fight organized crime. Despite these overtures, Calderon made no secret that Mexicans feel "very bad" about the visa rule.</p>
<p>At best, Harper's fence-mending was an ill-timed distraction from the bread-and-butter Buy America issue that directly affects Canadian manufacturers and their workers and from other key issues, including planning for more outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Mexico's drug wars, immigration issues, and energy policy and climate change.</p>
<p>Whatever Harper, Calderon and Obama may have said about Buy America policies in "candid and constructive" exchanges behind closed doors, this was a missed opportunity for a concerted, public show of Canadian-Mexican irritation. Bilateral damage control seemed to take precedence.</p>
<p>At his next meeting with Obama, in Washington on Sept. 16, Harper will be under pressure to demonstrate that his Conservative government can get a serious hearing from Washington's Democrats concerning the protectionism that is sweeping the U.S. A stronger show of Canadian-Mexican concern from Guadalajara wouldn't have hurt.</p>

</p>
<p>Brooke VanAssen can't do many of the things other nine-year-old kids take for granted: brush her teeth, roughhouse, gnaw at the inside of her cheek or absent-mindedly pick her nose, as children do.</p>
<p>These things put her at risk of bleeding to death.</p>
<p>Under the apple of her left cheek is a tangled mass of abnormal blood vessels fed by Brooke's carotid artery. Her gums and the inside of her cheek are purple, so to run the soft bristles of a toothbrush along them could cause them to bleed.</p>
<p>If Brooke was hit by a baseball, fell off her bike or even sneezed violently, the mass of veins and arteries swelling her face could burst.</p>
<p>Brooke, 9, has an arteriovenous malformation in her face. It is a rare disorder that affects less than one per cent of the population.</p>
<p>So far treatments haven't worked. In the past two years, the gnarled mass has tripled in size and fills 70 per cent of her sinuses. The bone under her last two teeth has been worn away by the pulsating balloon of blood flow, much like a rock is worn away by rushing streams.</p>
<p>Her parents will soon face bills of more than $120,000 US for hospital and medical fees so that Brooke can get specialized treatment from an American doctor who says he can cure the young girl.</p>
<p>They flew to Denver for the first of several treatments after the Alberta government denied funding for the out-of-country trips, saying comparable treatment was available in Canada. Jodi and Rob VanAssen disagree, and will be taking Brooke to the U. S. for at least three more appointments at $35,000 to $40,000 each time.</p>
<p>"Brooke's worth that kind of money," said Rob VanAssen, Brooke's father. "We had to do it and we can't afford it ourselves, but we trust and know the Lord is in charge of all things."</p>
<p>"The power of prayer has been awesome," said Jodi VanAssen, Brooke's mother.</p>
<p>While both are angry with the government's decision to turn down their funding request--they have appealed the decision and expect to hear back soon--they are turning toward their small farming and church communities for support.</p>
<p>The VanAssens, who have six children, haven't made a profit on their pig farm for three years. Hog prices recently fell from, hit hard by the fear surrounding the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Now, on top of a struggling farm, they have a daughter who wanders upstairs during the night, crying because she's had nightmares about losing her face and worried about the money it will take to fix it.</p>
<p>"How do you comprehend that as a nine-year-old?" Rob asked.</p>
<p>The couple may consider taking out a loan to help pay the medical bills. They are being supported by members of the Canadian Reformed Church in their small farming community of Neerlandia, 135 kilometres northwest of Edmonton, who set up a trust fund for donations.</p>
<p>Brooke's school held a barbecue and an Edmonton church held a garage sale. A bucket for donations was set up at the farmers market in Barrhead. Strangers from Westlock have even driven to Brooke's home to drop off money.</p>
<p>Enough has been raised to cover Brooke's first two medical visits.</p>
<p>"It gives us confidence that people believe in the decision we've made," Jodi said. "But ultimately, we know it can't last."</p>
<p>The problems started two years ago when Brooke began waking up each morning with a pool of blood on her pillow. Doctors made various diagnoses: an infection, a rare but severe bacteria treated with strong antibiotics, a birthmark in her cheek.</p>
<p>Then, on Valentine's Day 2007, Brooke almost bled to death when an Edmonton dentist extracted a molar, thinking there was something beneath the tooth.</p>
<p>She fainted in her father's arms and was taken by ambulance to the Stollery Children's Hospital, where she received a blood transfusion.</p>
<p>Eventually, doctors diagnosed Brooke with an AVM, or arteriovenous malformation, in her cheek. Some AVMs go unnoticed or can be safely cut out, although there is no guarantee they won't grow back. They can occur all over the body, in the lungs or heart, on feet or fingers, even the brain, where bleeding can lead to a stroke.</p>
<p>In Brooke's case, cutting out the AVM isn't an option.</p>
<p>"If you have to live without a jaw bone, it's not so easy," said Dr. Lyle McGonigle, Brooke's pediatrician. "It's a difficult thing to treat and it's a bad AVM. It's in a bad place and it's difficult to get at. It has lots of feeding vessels. I think it's pretty dangerous," especially as Brooke begins losing her baby teeth.</p>
<p>Doctors in Edmonton began treating her with embolization, using glue to create clots in the blood vessels. The work is complex and comes with some risk. If the wrong vessels are plugged, blood could stop feeding Brooke's nose, eye or cheekbone, potentially killing the tissue and parts of Brooke's face.</p>
<p>"It's probably been somewhat effective, but not very effective," Mc-Gonigle said of Brooke's early treatments. "In Brooke's case, it's hard to know what the right therapy is. I can tell you she needs therapy and she needs aggressive therapy."</p>
<p>McGonigle wrote an official letter to the province's Out of Country Health Services Committee, requesting funding coverage for the VanAssens to send Brooke to the United States for a different type of embolization therapy by Dr. Wayne Yakes. McGonigle said he isn't convinced the American-based therapy is more beneficial to Brooke, but believes the government should financially support the parents' decision.</p>
<p>"Dr. Yakes is very aggressive in attempting to clot off AVMs and he does it with a technique that is not universally accepted and has high risks and high side-effects," McGonigle said. "(Brooke) needs treatment and she needs aggressive treatment and the parents have decided that's the treatment they want after studying the available information to them. I think that is therapy we probably should be paying for her."</p>
<p>Yakes' treatment uses alcohol to destroy the cells lining the blood vessels in the AVM. When these cells die and peel off the vessel walls, blood platelets rush to patch the sites. They clump together and clot the blood flow permanently, Yakes said. He, too, must be careful not to block crucial blood flow to parts of Brooke's face.</p>
<p>"It's not experimental at all," said Yakes. "It's been proven in literature on every continent."</p>
<p>Yakes said 80 per cent of the cases he treats with alcohol are cured. He sees about 1,000 patients each year from around the world, and helped train doctors in Cairo, London, Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Europe. He said Brooke's treatment is going well so far.</p>
<p>"She is such a tough little kid," he said in a telephone interview. He is also helping the VanAssens by providing multiple treatments at each visit, but only charging for one. "We're unfortunate that the (Alberta) government refused to do anything to help, and they count their health-care services the best in the world. Denying this child, I think that's unconscionable."</p>
<p>John Tuckwell, spokesman for Alberta Health, said he can't comment on Brooke's case, but said the committee that looks at applications for out-of-country health care makes its decisions based solely on medical advice. The committee isn't even told how much the treatments cost.</p>
<p>Tuckwell said the committee tries to determine if the treatment is available elsewhere in Canada rather than another country.</p>
<p>In its letter to the VanAssens, the committee said it denied funding because embolization treatment with glue is available in Alberta and Toronto, even though "it may not be the technique and/or particular treatment the parent prefers."</p>
<p>"Canadian resources have not been fully utilized," the letter reads.</p>
<p>Rob and Jodi VanAssen said their decision has nothing to do with preference, but is necessary for their daughter.</p>
<p>"We are upset. We are very disappointed," Rob said. "The minister of health is putting a stranglehold on our health-care system."</p>
<p>"It's not about preference. It's about a cure," Jodi said. "To them, our daughter is a number with a big dollar sign beside her name. But she's our daughter. How can you say a life isn't important?"</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Harper pledges to aid Mexico in drug war; Security a priority at two-day summit</b>
</div><div>Andrew Mayeda   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>362 words</div><div>10 August 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced Sunday that Canada will train Mexican police officers to assist Mexico in its brutal war against rival drug cartels.</p>
<p>The announcement came as the prime minister touched down here for a two-day summit with Mexican President Felipe Calderon and U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Security will be one of the issues on the agenda at the summit, along with the global recession, the swine-flu outbreak and climate change.</p>
<p>Through the Anti-Crime Capacity Building Program, Canada will invest as much as $15 million a year in projects across the Americas that combat the illicit drug trade, corruption, human trafficking and other regional problems.</p>
<p>Slightly more than $430,000 will go to Mexico to help it fight its drug war, which claimed more than 6,000 people last year, almost double the number of deaths in the previous year.</p>
<p>Global drug cartels in Mexico have been feuding over access to the lucrative North American market. The U.S. State Department, for example, estimates that 90 per cent of the cocaine that enters the U.S. flows through Mexico.</p>
<p>Calderon has staked his presidency on his government's aggressive response, vowing to defeat the cartels by the time his term ends in 2012. After taking office in late 2006, Calderon sent thousands of troops to back up the police in drug hot spots.</p>
<p>Under the program announced Sunday, the RCMP will train 300 mid-level Mexican police officers with the help of the United States and other countries. The Mounties will also train 32 new police commanders in such areas as police management, investigation and intelligence skills.</p>
<p>Harper met with Calderon in a bilateral meeting Sunday, where the most contentious topic between the two was expected to be Ottawa's recent decision to impose visas on Mexican nationals entering Canada.</p>
<p>Mexican sources said Calderon was to press Harper to drop the visa restrictions, but at a spokesman for the prime minister has said that did not appear to be in the cards.</p>

<p>Re: Masks, handwashing slow spread of flu, Aug. 4.</p>
<p>What is so interesting to me about this news article on handwashing and facemasks slowing the spread of the H1N1 flu is that the lessons of basic hygiene are "in" again for the public to protect themselves. The basic lesson of washing hands with soap is being taught and retaught around the world.</p>
<p>Washing hands with soap isn't just important to stop the spread of H1N1, it's also the most cost-effective intervention that could save children's lives.</p>
<p>Diarrheal diseases and pneumonia kill almost 3.5 million children every year. According to UNICEF, handwashing could cut those numbers by 30 to 44 per cent. Yet the Canada International Development Agency (CIDA) spends very little on sanitation issues like personal handwashing -- an estimated 10 per cent of $70 million annually spent on broader water and sanitation issues.</p>
<p>In March, Results Canada, the organization I work for, took three Canadian MPs to Bangladesh to see how people in many rural villages and small communities are using simple, cost-effective solutions in the fight against tuberculosis. We saw how Canadian and international funds were helping people.</p>
<p>Our visit happened just before the monsoons when hospitals and communities were bracing for what comes with the rains -- diarrhea season.</p>
<p>I saw community health volunteers and doctors in hospitals getting ready for it, engaging in educating people and repeating the basic messages about how important handwashing is to stop the spread of diseases like pneumonia, to prevent diarrhea, reduce malnutrition and save lives.</p>
<p>Back home, at my workplace, handwashing signs have gone up recently. Antibacterial sanitizer pumps are now everywhere in offices and public places, not just hospitals and doctors' offices.</p>
<p>Because basic handwashing is such an important tool in fighting the No. 1 killer of kids and infectious diseases like H1N1, let's hope CIDA's spending on basic sanitation and hygiene goes up as quick as those handwashing signs and sanitizer pumps have.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The world is not prepared for an H1N1 outbreak</b>
</div><div>Jorge R. Mancillas   </div>
<div>753 words</div><div>10 August 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>GENEVA</p>
<p>The influenza A (H1N1) pandemic is now unstoppable. The world missed its chance, and containment is no longer a possibility. Efforts to contain the outbreak were impeded by the consistent downplaying of the extent and immediacy of the threat. Those influential "voices of reason'' that restrained the World Health Organization from issuing stronger, earlier warnings also lulled governments into complacency.</p>
<p>Yet even as the virus spreads to every corner of the world and the realization of its seriousness sinks in, those same voices are dampening the sense of urgency necessary to mount an effective response.</p>
<p>Most of all, the threat is being obscured by the misleading statement that only a few will develop serious symptoms and die. It is true that only a small fraction of those infected are likely to die; the global fatality rate is currently 0.45 percent, or four or five in a thousand. But what happens once the number of those infected rises into the millions? The fatality rate may remain low, but the number of fatalities will no longer be few.</p>
<p>Just how severe is the threat? Recently, Britain's chief medical officer reported that modeling studies indicated that up to 65,000 people in that country could die. Projected globally, this worst-case estimate suggests the potential for 6.5 million deaths. Except that Britain's current fatality rate, as well as the higher rate that yielded the 65,000 figure, are both lower than the average global rate right now.</p>
<p>To calculate the potential fatalities worldwide, one must estimate the number of people likely to become infected (the clinical attack rate) and the percentage among them likely to die (the fatality rate). So far, the observed attack rate has been 30 per cent, meaning one in three who are exposed to the virus becomes infected. This suggests that more than two billion people are likely to be infected through successive waves of the pandemic over the next few months. Based on the observed global fatality rate of 0.45 to 0.5 per cent, between nine million and 10 million could die.</p>
<p>This global fatality rate, however, reflects current conditions. Some favorable factors may have kept the numbers down to date.</p>
<p>First, the virus initially appeared in mostly developed, Northern Hemisphere countries experiencing summer conditions. As the pandemic has spread to the Southern Hemisphere, we are seeing cases such as Argentina, where the fatality rate is five times higher, around 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>Second, at this stage, health systems have had to cope with relatively low numbers of patients, though in many cases they have still been overwhelmed. As the trickle turns into a flood, the capacity of these systems to identify those most at risk and to provide the best treatments may diminish. Again, the experience in the countries most affected so far shows that not only the number of fatalities but also the fatality rate increases with the number of cases.</p>
<p>No doubt the development of a vaccine will greatly help to reduce infections. While it will not reduce the fatality rate - a vaccine is a preventive measure, not a treatment - it should reduce fatalities. A vaccine is expected to be ready by September, after accelerated clinical trials.</p>
<p>But one must also remember that we will be engaged in a race to produce and distribute a vaccine before the virus mutates into a more virulent form (with a higher fatality rate) or a subtype that the vaccine is ineffective against. Influenza's high rate of mutation is the reason the vaccine against the seasonal flu has to be produced annually. By the time the second wave of the influenza A pandemic hits next year, the vaccine developed this year may be ineffective. This is why it is crucial to monitor the virus by taking regular samples in different regions.</p>
<p>In all these considerations, we have not even touched on the impact of medical costs, absenteeism and the disruption of economic activities in the midst of a global downturn.</p>
<p>To mitigate the effects of the pandemic, we must understand that influenza's threat does not necessarily result from its severity but its ease of contagion, its rapid spread and its high rate of mutation. It is crucial to accurately measure the threat. While the likely severity of the pandemic may continue to be debated, this flu strain has spread further in six weeks than previous ones have in six months.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Crackdown on visas stands, Harper says</b>
</div><div>Les Whittington   </div>

</p>
<p>GUADALAJARA, Mexico -- Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered Mexico no quick end to the visa requirement that is fraying Canada-Mexican relations, indicating that any change in the current requirements for Mexican visitors will await action by Parliament.</p>
<p>After a one-on-one meeting yesterday with Mexican President Felipe Calderon before the annual North American Leaders' Summit, Harper told the media the Conservative government was forced to bring in the visa requirement because of the rise in illegitimate refugee claims.</p>
<p>But Harper stressed that the reason for last month's visa crackdown - a source of widespread resentment in Mexico - was the fault of existing Canadian legislation and had nothing to do with the Calderon government.</p>
<p>"This is a problem of Canadian law, which encourages bogus claimants," Harper said shortly before sitting down to dinner with Calderon and U.S. President Barack Obama. Canada is spending "an enormous amount of money" dealing with illegitimate claims, the Prime Minister said, and "this can't continue."</p>
<p>It was Harper's staunchest defence so far of the controversial visa move.</p>
<p>MPs will have to fix the busted Canadian refugee system before Ottawa can reverse its decision to slap visa requirements on Mexicans, the Prime Minister said.</p>
<p>"I hope Parliament will take advantage of the attention that's been brought on this issue to deal with this problem," he said.</p>
<p>Obama - attending his first Three Amigos summit - arrived yesterday afternoon and sat down last night with Harper and Calderon for a private dinner.</p>
<p>In discussions slated to continue this morning, the leaders are expected to talk about climate change, efforts to combat drug trading and barriers to economic growth, including Canadian and Mexican concerns about growing protectionist practices by procurement officials in U.S. states and cities.</p>
<p>This country's drug war, which has claimed 11,000 lives since the Mexican government launched a campaign against the narcotics cartels in 2006, figures high on the agenda.</p>
<p>Mexico's drug gangs are increasingly a continental problem, fuelling illegal narcotics dealing in the U.S. and as far north as Vancouver.</p>
<p>To help out, Ottawa is increasing funding to train Mexico's police force, Harper announced before meeting Calderon. The RCMP will offer a variety of training programs to hundreds of Mexican federal police, ranging from rookie recruits to senior officers.</p>
<p>It's a modest program - just $400,000 from a $15 million-a-year fund set up in the 2009 federal budget to combat crime in the Americas.</p>
<p>But a Harper government official said Canada is prepared to do more if Mexico requests additional assistance.</p>
<p>The three leaders will also talk about cooperative efforts to fight the expected upsurge in swine flu cases this fall.</p>
<p>John Brennan, Obama's chief homeland security aide, said that as important as it is to further link up health officials and ready vaccine and antiviral supplies, the three leaders must work together and publicly reinforce a determination not to panic when cases arise.</p>
<p>"There are people who are going to be getting sick in the fall and die," Brennan said.</p>
<p>Keeping the severity and reach of the illnesses to a minimum is a priority, but officials also "want to make sure that we do everything possible to ensure the continuation of commerce, transportation and trade between the three countries."</p>
<p>Harper is not scheduled to have a one-on-one meeting with Obama here. But the Prime Minister is slated to have an official visit to the White House on Sept. 16.</p>
<p>About 400 people marched outside the summit yesterday to protest the effects of free trade and to demand benefits for retired Mexican labourers who worked in the U.S.</p>
<p>After the Mexico summit, Harper travels to Panama.</p>
<p>He's expected to announce a free trade deal with Panama when he meets tomorrow with President Ricardo Martinelli, a right-wing supermarket magnate who won the presidency of the country in May.</p>
<p>The agreement will be the culmination of 10 months of negotiations between Canadian and Panamanian officials.</p>

</p>
<p>GUADALAJARA, Mexico -- Prime Minister Stephen Harper sits down today with President Barack Obama and Mexico's leader for a meeting that will test the value to Canada of the North American summit process.</p>
<p>Today's discussion is the centrepiece of the fifth summit since 2005, when then-U.S. president George W. Bush kicked off the annual trilateral talks aimed at promoting economic growth and security on a continent-wide basis.</p>
<p>The closed-door chats give the leaders a chance to share their thinking, but whether this setting can produce results for Canada seems more unclear than ever.</p>
<p>The most urgent regional issue for Canada is the recent rise of protectionism in the United States. Barring Canadian suppliers from bidding on federally funded urban renewal projects in the U.S. is resulting in lost contracts - and lost jobs - in Canadian factories. And the problem is getting worse as U.S. cities and states gear up to award more contracts on projects paid for out of Obama's $787 billion (U.S.) stimulus package.</p>
<p>Harper and Mexican President Felipe Calderon are expected to raise concerns about the troubling Buy American phenomenon during the talks here. But for Canada, nothing concrete is expected from Obama on this problem until Harper visits Washington on Sept. 16. At that time, the Prime Minister and Obama are expected to hold serious talks on how to curb the protectionist wave sweeping the U.S.</p>
<p>At this meeting, Obama, who chose to hold a separate, one-on-one talk with Calderon yesterday, is focusing on issues of immense joint concern to Mexico and the United States: border security, drug trafficking and immigration.</p>
<p>While Canada has a stake in all these issues, trying to solve them in a North American context might not always be in Canada's interest.</p>
<p>For instance, underlying the U.S. protectionist issue is the widespread belief that many American policy-makers would be happy to exempt Canada. The thinking is that the Buy American war cry is not really aimed at Canada. Instead, it is said to reflect the angst of U.S. workers who have seen their jobs disappear as American companies transferred employment to low-wage jurisdictions such as China - and Mexico.</p>
<p>Similarly, Canada's problems with increasing U.S. security at the border bear similarities to difficulties between the U.S and Mexico. But the magnitude of the drug and immigration problems vexing Mexican-U.S. relations makes the issues on the U.S. northern border seem minuscule by comparison.</p>
<p>For instance, Harper yesterday trumpeted a $400,000-plus support package to help train Mexican police to better cope with the drug war plaguing Mexico. Obama, in contrast, is trying to manage a $1.4 billion package to aid Calderon's anti-drug fight.</p>
<p>In the past few years, these North American summits have lost credibility, particularly since many observers saw the Bush-led meetings as a cloak for promoting a right-wing business and security agenda around the continent. So, Obama's willingness to carry on with the annual North American summits may reinvigorate the process.</p>
<p>Noting that this will be Obama's first Three Amigos summit, Mexican Foreign Relations Minister Patricia Espinosa said recently, "We are very pleased with the dynamics of this engagement." The meeting, Espinosa said, will give momentum to efforts to solve regional problems and "give North America greater influence on world topics."</p>
<p>If these annual chats continue, they will certainly provide cohesion and cooperation on such issues as climate change and swine flu. But whether the summits will effectively address Canada's most pressing problems with its continental partners remains to be seen.</p>

<p>GUADALAJARA, MEXICO -- Stephen Harper is trying to repair frayed relations with Mexico despite his refusal to roll back new entry restrictions for its citizens, emerging from a meeting with Mexican President Felipe Calderon last night to say it's Canada's dysfunctional refugee system that made him do it.</p>
<p>Blaming Canada for the move is Mr. Harper's attempt to soothe the feelings of an insulted NAFTA partner just before three-way talks start on a raft of other pressing issues, from the economy to trade.</p>
<p>“This is not the fault of the government of Mexico – let me be very clear about this,” Mr. Harper told reporters, explaining his decision last month to clamp down on bogus refugee claims from Mexico by requiring Mexicans to get visas before entering Canada. “This is a problem in Canadian refugee law which encourages bogus claims.”</p>
<p>He and Mr. Calderon met for 40 minutes yesterday evening just before they joined U.S. President Barack Obama for the start of the two-day North American Leaders' Summit in Guadalajara, Mexico.</p>
<p>The normally chummy goodwill of these summits – known as Three Amigos get-togethers – has been strained by Ottawa's sudden visa clampdown.</p>
<p>Mexico has taken the less-than-neighbourly move as an affront and countered by slapping visa requirements on Canadian diplomats.</p>
<p>Mindful of the need to address this recent low in relations, the Harper government yesterday unveiled some modest police-training aid to help Mexican authorities as they wage a bloody and protracted battle against homegrown drug lords.</p>
<p>Just as Mr. Harper's plane touched down in Guadalajara – and only hours before he met with Mr. Calderon – the Tories announced Ottawa will deploy more Mounties to help train Mexican police on everything from fighting money laundering to intelligence gathering.</p>
<p>The drug war is a subject dear to Mr. Calderon's heart. Mexico has been plagued with rising drug-related violence in recent years, as rival cartels battle for control of smuggling and distribution routes. About 6,000 people died in drug-related violence in Mexico in 2008, nearly double the 3,042 killed a year earlier.</p>
<p>Mr. Harper insisted the visa obligation for Mexicans will remain in place until Canada's refugee system is fixed, calling on opposition parties to join his party in reforming Canada's refugee system to discourage bogus claimants.</p>
<p>“The visas will stay as long as the problem exists,” he said.</p>
<p>“Parliament should be seized with this issue [and] I hope our Parliament will take advantage of the attention that's been brought on this issue to deal with this problem,” Mr. Harper said.</p>
<p>“Because we have many legitimate refugee claimants … but we are spending an enormous amount of money on bogus refugee claims in a system that encourages those claims. And this can't continue this way.”</p>
<p>Mexico had grown to become the biggest source of refugee claimants in Canada, with claims nearly tripling since 2005 to 9,500 in 2008.</p>
<p>Despite the backlash from Mexico, the Harper government says it's pleased with the result of its new visa crackdown on Mexicans.</p>
<p>The number of refugee claims for Mexican nationals at Canadian ports of entry has slowed to a trickle, according to Mr. Harper's office.</p>
<p>There were 225 claims in the two weeks leading up to the clampdown, and there have only been 17 since, the Prime Minister's Office said last week.</p>
<p>Canada played down the notion that this has amounted to a rejection of Mexican visitors, noting that as of July 31 its Mexico City embassy has issued more than 15,000 visas and the acceptance rate for that office was about 90 per cent.</p>
<p>Despite Ottawa's unwillingness to repeal the visa policy any time soon, it's unlikely Mexico would respond in kind. Slapping the same obligations on Canadians vacationing in Mexico would only further hurt the country's tourist industry, already coping with the impact of the global recession.</p>
<p>The annual Three Amigos meeting, now in its fifth year, is showing signs of fading in importance. Missing from this year's agenda is the Security and Prosperity Partnership, adopted to advance economic and security integration. Senior North American business executives, invited in the past two years to help steer discussions, are also absent.</p>
<p>The NAFTA leaders will use the talks in Guadalajara to prepare for the September Group-of-20 economic summit, to discuss a feared fall resurgence of the swine flu virus, and how to fight climate change in a way that doesn't leave them offside with the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama is hoping to build a common front with Canada and Mexico, as all countries prepare for a key climate change abatement meeting in Copenhagen in December, where they will try to find a successor agreement to the Kyoto accord.</p>
<p>While he made efforts to stand in solidarity yesterday with Mr. Calderon's war on the drug cartels, the amount Canada is allocating is small.</p>
<p>Ottawa announced yesterday that Canada is tapping a $15-million fund set aside in the 2009 budget – but not spent – to allocate more than $400,000 for training aimed at more than 330 Mexican police officers and their commanders.</p>

</p>
<p>Hmmm. What to do with my $26 strike refund.</p>
<p>It's pretty exciting because it's not often these days that people get an infusion of cash. But clearly, there won't be money to burn, so I want to spend it wisely.</p>
<p>We need a new garbage can. We cracked one trying to stuff too much trash in it. I want a big honkin' Herby Curby that holds 96 gallons. That will see me through the next time the city goes after one of the public sector's sacred cows. A Herby Curby costs $6 a month, so I could afford it for four months, the length of another epic dispute plus the wait for garbage collection to catch up after.</p>
<p>We also need a jumbo air freshener. Our neighbourhood smells.</p>
<p>I went for a run a few days ago, and the fumes from the mounds of waste in front of every house were obnoxious, maybe even just plain noxious.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of festooning the outside of our house with hanging air fresheners, the kind that are green and shaped like trees. They'd be eco chic, which is all the rage, and would make us look environmentally conscious, even though the strike revealed that we produce an atrocious amount of garbage.</p>
<p>When the holidays arrive (we may not get our refunds until then anyway), and we're still trying to staunch the stench, they'll look like festive Christmas ornaments. At about $1 each, I should be able to afford a couple dozen.</p>
<p>For more bang for the buck, a colleague suggested face masks. We could wear them now, to minimize the miasma.</p>
<p>When flu season arrives in another couple months, bringing the next, more virulent wave of H1N1, the masks will do double duty, warding off the spread of the virus. We may not be able to afford the bejewelled ones reportedly being designed by DKNY, but the kind experts recommend are about $5. With five people in our family, we'll be set.</p>
<p>We need fly swatters, too. Apparently, the flies, buzzing with news of plentiful meals, have been honeymooning on our filth because there has been a population explosion.</p>
<p>I'll put my twin boys to work. They like whacking things (they're boys) and have endless energy. I'll pick some up at a dollar store. Everything there is more than a dollar, but I'll have enough money for extras.</p>
<p>We also need a dog to scare off the critters, including a family of raccoons, that sniffed our detritus, declared it delectable and moved into our yard. I know this will work because we used to have a border collie. When we moved in, the skunk under the deck was history, run out of the neighbourhood (after it sprayed Rufus twice in two days).</p>
<p>The problem is it costs $215 to adopt a dog from the humane society, way over my budget. But hamsters are only $20.... On second thought, maybe I could rent a dog.</p>
<p>If we really want to get rid of the problem, we'll have to deal with the smell and the goo in alleys throughout neighbourhoods and the downtown. Residents of Windsor, let's pool our refunds, rent a water cannon and blast it all to oblivion. Every kid in the city could have a turn sitting in the driver's seat and pressing the button. Kids love big trucks and hoses. It will make up for losing half their summer because pools were closed and recreation programs cancelled.</p>
<p>That still leaves the high grass in the parks. With only about 20 per cent of the grass cut, how about a pair of stilts? A cheap pair is $30 or $40. Can you buy just one stilt? How about a periscope, so the kids don't get lost in the prairie? You can get a kids' periscope on sale for $24.99 on Amazon.com. Spy on everybody in the yard, the ad says, or peer over the grass to find the playground.</p>
<p>Maybe we'll just forget about it all, relax and take our family out for supper. If our teenager gets a kid's meal and no one has dessert, we might be able to afford <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>. We'll throw caution to the wind, splurge and celebrate our windfall -- double Quarter Pounders with cheese, large fries and large Cokes for my husband and me, Chicken McNuggets, fries and Fruitopia (there's fruit in it somewhere) for the kids. That's a grand total of 4,930 calories, 219 grams of fat, 5,190 milligrams of sodium and 172 grams of sugar, all for about $26. What a steal.</p>
