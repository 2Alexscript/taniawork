<p>Question: What if one member of our household is sick with the flu? Should the rest of us stay home as well?</p>
<p>Answer: Public health officials ask that if you are sick with an influenza-like illness, self-isolate at home and stay home until you are symptom-free. If you can isolate yourself from the rest of the household, other family members can go about their usual activities. Everyone in the household should observe good infection control practices (wash your hands often with soap and water, clean shared surfaces frequently). If the sick person requires a care-giver, that care-giver can go about their usual business as long as they are symptom-free. Remember, the majority of residents who contract H1N1 will only experience a mild flu, lasting three to four days.</p>

<p>Seven more deaths linked to the H1N1 virus were confirmed Monday, as Health Canada announced a webcast to be held Tuesday to discuss how one of the most vulnerable populations -- First Nations people -- can best combat the illness.</p>
<p>The virus contributed to five deaths in Alberta, bringing the toll in that province to 25, while a 48-year-old man and a 69-year-old woman from Newfoundland and Labrador also died from complications associated with the virus.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services also announced plans to begin inoculating children under 10 beginning today.</p>
<p>Along with children with diabetes, obesity, cancer and Down syndrome, the agency lists children residing in group-living facilities as being eligible. The children will need proof of age and, if applicable, documentation regarding prescriptions or a description of the condition.</p>
<p>Health Canada, meanwhile, issued a news release saying that Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and Shawn Atleo, the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, would co-host the First Nations H1N1 Virtual Summit.</p>
<p>The two will take part in the webcast, which intends to reach out to "First Nations communities across the country with the opportunity to exchange information on H1N1 preparedness/actions" with Atleo and Aglukkaq.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 shots available to new high-risk groups</b>
</div><div>Pamela Cowan   </div>
<div>The Leader-Post</div>
<div>543 words</div><div>10 November 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Beginning today at the former Robert Usher Collegiate, several high-risk groups will be able to receive H1N1 vaccinations.</p>
<p>These groups include:</p>
<p>- Severely immunocompromised individuals of all ages including patients on dialysis,</p>
<p>- Those undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy,</p>
<p>- People who are HIV positive,</p>
<p>- Patients with leukemia/lymphoma as well as people with other severe immunodeficiency or on immunosuppresive therapy, and,</p>
<p>- Organ or stem cell transplant recipients.</p>
<p>Also qualifying for the H1N1 shot today are people under 35 with underlying medical conditions such as chronic heart disease, diabetes, asthma and chronic lung disease, kidney disease, blood disorders, severe obesity, liver disease and those treated for long periods with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).</p>
<p>Primary caregivers (up to a maximum of two) of children under six months of age will also be eligible to roll up their sleeves.</p>
<p>School officials with the public and Catholic school systems reported that H1N1 immunizations went smoothly on Monday -- the first day Regina children from kindergarten to Grade 6 began getting the shots.</p>
<p>"Everything seems to be going fine," said Regina Public Schools spokesman Terry Lazarou.</p>
<p>He didn't know how many public school students were vaccinated. Schools sent information and consent forms home with children, but the school divisions don't track the results; the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region does.</p>
<p>"If they were our consent forms, we would have tallied them. But since they aren't, we don't know," said Regina Catholic Schools spokeswoman Jennifer Cartwright. "We haven't heard of any problems at the division level and, typically, we would if there was a problem with the process."</p>
<p>Mark Torjusen, spokesman with the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region, said there was a strong demand for the vaccinations at the schools.</p>
<p>"There was a very strong uptake in terms of children being vaccinated," Torjusen said. "We had to shuffle some staff around, but there was enough people to carry out the vaccinations."</p>
<p>At Usher Collegiate, nurses will continue to vaccinate the groups started on Nov. 2. These include children six months to less than five years, pregnant women, women up to four weeks post partum, and children aged five years through to Grade 6. Torjusen was not aware of lengthy waits at Usher on Monday.</p>
<p>This week, clinics will run from 9 a.m. to 7:45 p.m. except for Wednesday -- Remembrance Day.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a clinic will be held at Robert Usher from 9 a.m. to 7:45 p.m. and at the Core-Ritchie Neighbourhood Centre, 445-14th Ave., from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>People are asked to bring their Saskatchewan health cards to the clinics. As more vaccine becomes available, vaccinations will be extended to other high-risk groups, and then the general public.</p>
<p>Information about pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccination clinics in Regina and the region's rural communities is now available through the region's H1N1 influenza information line. The public can call the toll-free line at 1-888-354-8111 for dates, times and locations of immunization clinics in the region. Information on clinics and who is eligible to receive pandemic H1N1 vaccinations is also available on the region's website: www.rqhealth.ca[http://www.rqhealth.ca].</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The babe of brewskies; Tom Guinness is more than just a razor-sharp jawline --he's a DJ, too!</b>
</div><div>Shinan Govani   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>579 words</div><div>10 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>AL3</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Afew weeks after Theodora Richards came to town to slither down a catwalk, Tom Guinness was found DJing a party. This, while our Alexandra Weston stood at the gateway meeting, minding and wrangling.</p>
<p>Haven't you heard? Modelling, spinning and PR! It's the new book-publishing, for the heady new generation of lantern-lit last-name-holders. (Indeed, the days when a job-seeking Jackie O retreated to the genteel cocoon of Doubleday Books seem so long ago.)</p>
<p>The 22-year-old Guinness -- see "brewery babe" in the social register -- was in Toronto to make Burberry music last week at a bash designed to mark the opening of the posh plaid-bearerers on Bloor Street. With a jaw so chiselled he could rip off Lara Croft's bra with his teeth, a distinct peek-a-boo of a tattoo and the presentation of a suitably lanky, well-metabolizing constitution, the grimy-hot Tom appeared, posed, put on his headphones and went to work.</p>
<p>"How is he related to Daphne Guinness?" someone asked of me, wondering about the DJ's connection to one of the contemporary world's style icons, not to mention haute-est couture-gobblers.</p>
<p>"Half-brother," I matter-of-facted. (Hey, I do my research!) Indeed, as I didn't prattle on then, but will do so now: He's actually the eighth and youngest child of Irish near-royal Jonathan Guinness (a. k.a. Lord Moyne); his mother was the Lord's long-standing mistress, Susan "Shoe" Taylor (a. k.a. a famous '60s flower child); his grandmother none other than that notorious British aristocrat and great literary beauty, Diana Mitford.</p>
<p>"Isn't that him up there?" someone else at the shindig pointed out, lifting their eyes to a poster on the wall. It was Tom -- with Harry Potter beauty Emma Watson. Indeed, this young buck is a Burberry double-dipper, you might say -- he not only DJs, but models for the ever-evocative brand.</p>
<p>"How about some Stones?" I eventually asked the runway-ready music-minder, going up to him at his booth. I'll get right on that, he (and his hair) motioned.</p>
<p>And he did.</p>
<p>Question, though: Does a bloke like Tom have to actually work (or walk) for a living? And is his pleasure actually just business? A few years ago, reports spread that the Irish clan is now so big, there are 12 family trees with about 90 living members on one branch alone. And even with a family fortune estimated at about x80840-million at one point, that beer money doesn't distill so well.</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, the family -- according to the latest Tatler, in a stupendous spread in the mag about the clan--does have one crucially amazing talent. It continues to generate "high standards of Guinness genetic output."</p>

<p>Today's top stories from Report on Business :</p>
<p>Dow Jones tops year high</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average surged to its highest level in more than a year as a the falling U.S. dollar juiced prices for commodities, including oil and gold, and investors grew more confident that interest rates will remain low. It was what the G20 finance officials didn't say on the weekend that played out in financial markets as the U.S. dollar sank and gold poked through a fresh high. The Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers, meeting in Scotland, voiced little concern about the state of the greenback. That left investors with nothing to change the outlook for U.S. interest rates that are at historic lows, sending money instead into other currencies and other assets. According to preliminary calculations, the Dow rose 203.52, or 2 per cent, to 10,226.94, its highest finish since Oct. 3, 2008. The index rose as high as 10,228.23, topping its previous 12-month trading high of 10,119.46 set last month. Investors see the dollar as weaker than other currencies, and so they’re using it for what’s known as “carry trade,” to finance purchases of investments in other countries. That trend takes the dollar down further when those purchases are made. Some analysts question the markets' heights, warning that stocks and other investments could suffer if the greenback rises again. “It feels like it’s on fumes,” said Sean Simko, head of fixed income management at SEI Investments in Oaks, Pa., referring to the market’s advance. “Although fundamentals are catching up, they’re not caught up.”</p>
<p>Kraft seen having to raise Cadbury bid</p>
<p>Analysts believe Kraft Foods Inc. will have to boost its $16.4-billion (U.S.) hostile bid for Cadbury PLC , which the British candy maker again rejected today. It's shaping up as an interesting fight. Kraft, whose brands include Oreo cookies and Nabisco crackers, had floated the takeover earlier but was required under British regulations to launch a formal bid by today or walk away for at least six months. The official offer unveiled today was similar to its first proposal, but actually lower because the share prices of the food companies have since changed. While investors see Kraft going higher, there appears to be no rush. Other potential bidders had their chance earlier and haven't yet come out of the wings despite much speculation that they would. Cadbury, the 195-year-old British company known for its Dairy Milk chocolate bar, dismissed the offer as not coming “remotely close to reflecting the true value of our company.” Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/kraft-makes-new-lowered-bid-for-cadbury/article1356365/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/kraft-makes-new-lowered-bid-for-cadbury/article1356365/])</p>
<p>Google acquires mobile ad company</p>
<p>Google Inc. is moving ever faster into the market for Internet-enabled cellphones, announcing a takeover key to monetizing mobile Web traffic. Google is paying $750-million (U.S.) in stock for AdMob, a maker of technology for serving display advertisements on mobile phones and tracking their performance. Google is the world's top Internet search engine, and its Android software is increasingly used in smart phones. The deal unveiled today would allow the technology giant to serve advertisers better as they move further into the world of mobile. Said Google's vice-president of product management Susan Wojcicki: “Mobile advertising has enormous potential as a marketing medium, and while this industry is still in the early stages of development, AdMob has already made exceptional progress in a very short time.” Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/google-to-buy-mobile-ad-network/article1356728/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/google-to-buy-mobile-ad-network/article1356728/])</p>
<p>Mega Brands settles legal fight</p>
<p>Mega Brands said today it settled a bitter legal feud with the former owners of Rose Art Industries Inc., the New Jersey arts-and-crafts company it acquired four years ago. Under the deal, Mega Brands will receive $17.2-million in cash, while the former owners abandon any additional claims, estimated at $54.8-million. The purchase of Rose Art was supposed to be a major boost to Mega Brands after the 2005 acquisition, but turned into a marketing nightmare for the Montreal-based toy maker after reports of magnets coming loose from Rose Art's Magnetix toys. There were a series of recalls and an expensive redesign. While Mega Brands said today that the settlement validated its long-standing claim, the former owners said they agreed to drop their claim because Mega Brands' financial condition did not justify incurring further legal costs.

<p>Investing: Flu, strong dollar to eat into profits</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu, the strong dollar and higher fuel prices will eat into profits across a range of industries this year, the Conference Board of Canada predicts. The economy is recovering, and profits are expected to resume growing, but the recovery will be shaky in several sectors, the group said in a report compiled in collaboration with the Business Development Bank of Canada. “All industries are grappling with the effects of reduced demand and downward pressure on prices as a result of the recession,” said Michael Burt, the group's associate director responsible for industrial economic trends research. “On the upside, the recession has lowered input prices and limited wage growth, reducing costs pressures.” Sector-by-sector breakdown (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/flu-dollar-threat-to-profits/article1356684/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/flu-dollar-threat-to-profits/article1356684/])</p>
<p>Carney sees softer third quarter</p>
<p>Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney says recent indicators may suggest a softer third quarter than expected. But, he told reporters in Scotland at the G20 meeting on Saturday, there's nothing to indicate that slower-than-anticipated growth will derail the rebound, Bloomberg News reported today. The central bank chief was quoted as saying that recent data suggest “a somewhat softer third quarter, but again the profile of the recovery – with growth strengthening into the fourth quarter and into 2010 – I would say remains in place. We're at a turning point in the economic cycle, is our expectation, and the beginnings of the return to growth. The data is going to be choppy.” Mr. Carney has said Canada returned to growth, although the first two months of the third quarter show an economy that remains stalled.</p>
<p>Central bankers to pull back cautiously</p>
<p>The world's central bankers say they will begin pulling back emergency measures gradually, but they do see improvements in the economy. European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet, chair of talks on the economy at a Bank for International Settlements meeting in Basel, Switzerland, told reporters that “we see elements that are encouraging, the confirmation of the fact that we avoided the extreme depression, but we have elements that call for common vigilance. For central banks that relied on emergency moves, he said, “there is an element of gradual and timely phasing out of some of these measures.” Australia and Norway have already boosted interest rates, while other major central banks, including the Bank of Canada, have promised to keep rates low for some time.</p>
<p>Other signs today also point to an economy on the mend. Exports from Germany, a bellwether given that it is Europe's biggest economy and the world's largest exporter, rose more than expected in September. While still down sharply from a year ago, the month-to-month change is yet another signal of a rebound. Germany has already come out of recession. Germany's industrial output in September also increased more than expected, in part to meet the growing demand for its exports, another strong sign from the country that it looks to lead Europe out of its slump.</p>
<p>Housing market continues comeback</p>
<p>Economists believe the Canadian housing market will continue its comeback, particularly after another strong showing in construction today, though housing starts will take some time to return to pre-recession levels. Starts rose 5.4 per cent in October, increasing to 157,300 on an annualized basis from 149,300 in September, largely on the gains in condominium construction, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said today. Starts on single homes actually dipped, though they're still at their second highest level since the meltdown began in October, 2008. Some comments from economists:</p>
<p>“Although housing starts remain depressed, with activity below the 175,000 units necessary to keep pace with population growth and attrition, it is clear that the trajectory for the sector is towards recovery.” HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc. economist Stewart Hall</p>
<p>“While home-building activity still has a long recovery ahead and cannot reasonably be expected to revisit boom-type levels (at or above 200,000 units) over the next few years, the recovery seems well engaged.” TD economist Pascal Gauthier</p>
<p>“It adds to the growing list of indicators that have been pointing to a recovery ... though the rebound in residential construction has remain fairly modest.” TD Securities economics strategist Millan Mulraine</p>
<p>China marks ‘renewal' of relations with Africa</p>
<p>China is taking steps to fight suggestions that it is gobbling up Africa's resources. China's commerce minister, Chen Deming, is at a two-day summit, and said today that this year marks “the renewal of China-Africa relations.” China's ties to Africa have boosted trade to more than $100-billion (U.S.), but critics have said China is investing for its own benefit, with no assurances of sustainable benefits to African countries. Mr. Chen saidthat by pushing agriculture and infrastructure, China is helping Africa toward economic independence. Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/china-sees-africa-economic-independence/article1356272/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/china-sees-africa-economic-independence/article1356272/])</p>
<p>Bonuses heading for record</p>
<p>An analysis by Bloomberg News suggests the giants of Wall Street – Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s investment bank –are set to pay record bonuses this year. According to analysts' estimates, Bloomberg News says, they will pay almost $30-billion (U.S.) in bonuses, up from the previous record $26.8-billion two years ago. The payout would also mark a 60-per-cent hike from last year. Split among 119,000 people, it would average $250,400 each, the news agency said. The payouts come amid mounting controversy about bankers' pay in the wake of the financial crisis. Paul Hodgson, a senior research associate on compensation for Corporate Library in Portland, Maine, told Bloomberg: “all Street is beginning to resemble Clark Gable as Rhett Butler in the film Gone With the Wind : ‘Quite frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.'” In an interview with London's Sunday Times, Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein said the Wall Street giant has a social purpose in helping companies grow by raising capital, which in turn creates wealth.</p>

<p>Sun Youth launched its annual holiday campaign yesterday as members of the Sikh community donated $2,000 worth of gift certificates for victims of fires. , Sid Stevens, the organization's co-founder, said he expects the next few months to be difficult because of the economic downturn and the H1N1 flu pandemic. Stevens said Sun Youth has seen a 25-per-cent increase in the number of people using its food bank. He said he's afraid that people who contract the flu won't be thinking about donating to a food bank. "We're telling people, 'If you normally give four cans, please give five, and if you have never given, please start.' " Sun Youth normally prepares baskets for 6,000 families for distribution around Christmas time.</p>

</p>
<p>People under 65 on Montreal Island with a chronic medical condition can get their inoculation against H1N1 immediately rather than wait another week or two, health authorities announced yesterday.</p>
<p>Authorities rolled out the vaccination welcome mat for adults with cardiac, lung or other chronic problems 15 days ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>They cited shorter than anticipated weekend lineups at clinics, combined with an adequate supply of the vaccine.</p>
<p>For children with chronic conditions, age 5 to 18, the shots are being made available eight days earlier than anticipated.</p>
<p>"There is now some space available in our clinics to proceed a little more quickly than we had forecast, for some of the at-risk groups," said Dr. Robert Lessard of Montreal public health services.</p>
<p>"We have for Montreal (Island) about 150,000 vaccine doses currently available," Lessard told a media briefing.</p>
<p>"We want to distribute them as quickly as possible."</p>
<p>Also starting today, women who are fewer than 20 weeks pregnant can receive an adjuvant-free version of the vaccine.</p>
<p>As well, Quebec might move up the vaccination schedule for healthy children age 5 to 18 by two weeks, said Marie-Ève Bédard, press attaché to Health Minister Yves Bolduc.</p>
<p>As it stands, this group is scheduled for shots beginning Dec. 7.</p>
<p>Yesterday's shift for people under 65 with chronic conditions represents a significant acceleration in vaccine deployment.</p>
<p>Before it was made, those age 5 to 18 with a chronic illness were to have become eligible for H1N1 vaccination next Monday. For those age 18 to 65 with a chronic illness, the original date for inoculation was Nov. 23.</p>
<p>(Adults with immune deficiencies became eligible for their shot Nov. 5.)</p>
<p>In a separate announcement yesterday, Quebec said it intends to send so-called "flying squads" of nurses into public and private long-term care residences to inoculate seniors with reduced mobility, when they become eligible.</p>
<p>But seniors who are able to get around on their own will be expected to go to regular vaccination clinics with the rest of the population, Bédard said.</p>
<p>Under the current schedule, healthy adults won't be eligible for shots until Dec. 7.</p>
<p>Echoing Bédard, however, Lessard suggested that an accelerated vaccination schedule is possible for others who don't yet qualify.</p>
<p>Decisions could be made quickly, he added. "We're having a meeting about that" this morning.</p>
<p>The announcement about "flying-squads" was applauded by Luc Vallerand, director-general of the Association québécoise des retraité(e)s des secteurs public et parapublic.</p>
<p>"A lot of the residents can't get around very well and are sick" in what are known as Centres d'hébergement et de soins longue durée, or CHSLDs, Vallerand said.</p>
<p>His group had been lobbying to bring the vaccination campaign into long-term care residences.</p>
<p>Neither Vallerand nor Bédard were able to provide more specific details, but Vallerand said his group will continue to lobby the health minister so that seniors with chronic illnesses will be vaccinated sooner.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, officials at the vaccination site at Place Alexis Nihon said so few people turned up for shots yesterday that they began to vaccinate even those who were not on the priority list, according to news reports.</p>
<p>So far, about one million Quebecers have been vaccinated against the flu strain, which has killed at least seven people in the province.</p>

</div><div>Virginia Galt  </div>
<div>1711 words</div><div>9 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail (Breaking News)</div><div>GMBN</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Profits will be down more than 20 per cent this year across a range of industries analyzed by the Conference Board of Canada.</p>
<p>The economy is recovering, and profit growth is expected to resume, but the recovery will be shaky in several sectors, the Conference Board said in a report Monday.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus could put additional pressure on the recession-battered food services and accommodation sectors, rising fuel costs are hurting transportation industries and the high Canadian dollar is a boon for importers, but a headache for exporters, the Conference Board said in a report compiled in collaboration with the Business Development Bank of Canada.</p>
<p>“All industries are grappling with the effects of reduced demand and downward pressure on prices as a result of the recession,” said Michael Burt, the Conference Board's associate director responsible for industrial economic trends research. “On the upside, the recession has lowered input prices and limited wage growth, reducing cost pressures.”</p>
<p>Here's a sector-by-sector breakdown:</p>
<p>Wholesale trade: Profit growth expected to resume in 2010</p>
<p>“This industry is closely linked to the performance of the overall economy,” the Conference Board said. “Wholesalers dependent on the auto sector and construction industry have suffered badly. However, sectors such as food, apparel and pharmaceuticals are less sensitive to business cycles and actually expanded during the recession.</p>
<p>“Profits will fall for the second consecutive year in 2009, from $14.5-billion to $11.2-billion. But as the recession fades, profit growth will resume in 2010.”</p>
<p>The good:The strong dollar has been a major source of cost-savings, as a large portion of the goods sold by this sector are imported. Also, wholesale sales to automotive sector are rebounding with several temporarily-shuttered plants coming back online. Location is a key advantage for Canadian wholesalers, as they are the link between buyers and sellers. This reduces the threat of foreign competitors.</p>
<p>The not-so-good: The industry is highly competitive, the Conference Board said. This means that recent cost savings resulting from the strong Canadian dollar are being passed through to customers, limiting profit margins. Also, demand for wholesale services depends on the ability of other industries, such as retail, to sell their products. Wholesalers have little power to stimulate sales at the retail level, the Conference Board said.</p>
<p>Threats:With the expansion of the Internet, it is becoming easier for retailers to skip the wholesale industry and buy directly from manufacturers.</p>
<p>Accommodation: Dollar, H1N1 a threat to recovery</p>
<p>“Canadians are staying closer to home, but domestic demand has not been enough to offset the sharp decline in U.S. and foreign travellers,” the Conference Board said. “The strong dollar has also made Canada a more expensive destination.</p>
<p>“After a 25 per cent decline in profits last year, industry profits are expected to fall a further 8 per cent in 2009, to just below $500-million. The accommodation industry could face a shaky recovery, as the experience with SARS in 2003 shows that an H1N1 outbreak would put additional pressure on the industry.”</p>
<p>The good: Frugal Canadians are cutting travel costs by staying closer to home, supporting domestic demand for accommodations. Wages have also been declining over the past nine months, the Conference Board said. “Those who do hire are finding it easier, and therefore, less expensive, to attract new workers and retain their existing ones.” Overseas visitors tend to make the most of their holidays by staying longer and spending more, helping to offset the loss of business from U.S. residents. Also, low interest rates are providing relief in this sector where investment requirements are high.</p>
<p>The not-so-good: The strong Canadian dollar has made Canada a relatively expensive destination for travellers. Plus, the labour shortage that hampered the sector prior to the recession will again become an issue as the economy bounces back.</p>
<p>Threats: Widespread H1N1 infections could reduce willingness to travel and “eventually lead to outright travel restrictions being put in place,” the Conference Board said.</p>
<p>Also, the reduction in in the number of U.S. visitors could prove to be permanent because of tighter border restrictions, the high dollar and the depth of the U.S. recession.</p>
<p>Food Services: Full-service restaurants hurt by consumers grabbing a quicker, cheaper bite</p>
<p>“Lower-cost establishments have held up well during the downturn, leaving full-service restaurants to bear the brunt of the recession. After making $1.2-billion in 2008, the industry is expected to see profit levels of $826-million in 2009, a 32 per cent reduction,” the Conference Board said.</p>
<p>Consumers have responded to the recession by choosing cheaper optiona when eating out or by just staying at home.</p>
<p>The good: Over the past decade, the share of each consumer food dollar spent on eating out has increased. The Conference Board believes the recession-era reversal of this trend will prove to be temporary, and Canadians will start treating themselves to life's little pleasures again. Lower labour costs have provided some relief for the industry and with more Canadians choosing “staycations” this year, domestic tourism spending has increased slightly, although not enough to offset the decline in foreign spending.”</p>
<p>The not-so-good: More consumers are opting to eat at home because restaurant meals are one of the first expenses to be cut when Canadians tighten their belts. Increases in minimum wages will also increase costs for the industry at a time when revenues are weak.</p>
<p>Threats: With the flu season coming up, a widespread outbreak of H1N1 could cut into business. Also, seniors spend more of their food dollars at home – and senior account for a rising share of the population.</p>
<p>Retail: Benefits from the strong dollar, outlook expected to improve</p>
<p>“Weak consumer demand, combined with price cuts, has slashed industry profits by 32 per cent – from $12.6-billion last year to $8.6-billion in 2009,” the Conference Board said. “However, in contrast to many other industries, the strong dollar benefits retailers by lowering the cost of imports.”</p>
<p>Retailers were forced to lower prices and offer discounts as the recession took hold. However, consumer confidence is slowly recovering.</p>
<p>“The worst is now over, and as employment and income begin to recover, so too will retail sales.”</p>
<p>The good: With a large number of Canadian retailers’ products imported from other countries, the strong dollar has been a major source of cost-saving for the industry.</p>
<p>Also, some segments of the industry are not overly sensitive to economic cycles and continue to grow in spite of the economic downturn.</p>
<p>The not-so-good: Consumers are saving a bigger share of their income as they attempt to rebuild wealth lost in the stock market.</p>
<p>Also, intense competition has limited “the pricing power” of many individual companies.</p>
<p>Threats: “If Canadian retailers don’t make effective use of the Internet, foreign players will begin to take a greater share of the domestic market.”</p>
<p>Transportation, warehousing: High fuel costs and lower demand exact a toll</p>
<p>“Canada's transportation and warehousing industry has been battered by lower travel demand, along with diminishing global trade and manufacturing production. Most of the different segments of the industry – including air, rail, water, and road transportation – suffered badly in 2009,” the Conference Board said.</p>
<p>“Profit levels fell 29 per cent from $7.3-billion in 2008 to $5.2-billion in 2009. Looking forward, the industry is expected to experience a robust recovery once the recession is past.”</p>
<p>For air transportation, the recession caused consumers to reduce travel spending and businesses to cut corporate travel. For rail and water transportation, “the pain came from dwindling international trade as production and demand in most countries contracted. Road transportation was hurt by the decline in manufacturing activity.</p>
<p>The good: Looking forward, the industry will return to above-average growth once the recession is over, the Conference Board said. Government infrastructure investments will provide better roads, ports and other facilities for transportation companies, saving them time and money. An expected increase in oil sands production is also spurring strong investments in pipelines.</p>
<p>The not-so-good: Oil prices remain high, and they are expected to rise further. This will continue to challenge industry profitability, the Conference Board said.</p>
<p>Also the Canadian dollar is expected to remain strong, increasing the cost of Canadian goods and resources, the making Canada a relatively expensive destination for travellers.</p>
<p>Threats: “Potential new regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions could be costly, requiring investment in training and equipment to become more efficient.”</p>
<p>Food and beverage manufacturing: Largely recession proof</p>
<p>“ In contrast to many other industries, food and beverage manufacturing has been largely recession-proof. Domestic food demand remained steady and exports to new markets grew in spite of the strong dollar, while lower commodity prices have pushed costs down,” The Conference Board said. “The industry made $3.3-billion in 2008 and profits are expected to rise modestly to $3.4-billion in 2009.</p>
<p>The industry is pulling through the recession with minimal damage. Demand for food has not decreased, although consumers have switched to lower-cost foods, the Conference Board said. This has lowered profit margins. “Fortunately, exports of manufactured food products are holding up well, partly because Canada has been successful in penetrating new markets, such as China and Mexico.”</p>
<p>The good: People have to eat. Also, the Canadian industry is becoming less dependent on the United States. Canadian food and beverage manufacturers have also been able to attract consumers to new products with higher margins “by providing increased convenience, or food with greater health benefits.”</p>
<p>The not-so-good: The strong dollar has hurt export growth and prices. With the loonie expected to stay close to parity with the U.S. dollar, this will continue to weigh on the sector. Trade restrictions – such as bans on Canadian pork by Venezuela, China and Russia in response to H1N1 (known as swine flu) – limit opportunities for export growth.</p>
<p>Threats: “Consumers are asking for diversity,” the Conference Board said. “If Canadian producers are too slow to change their product mix, imports of food products could surge.”</p>

<p>It’s absolutely essential: McGuinty urges everyone to get H1N1 vaccine, despite delays, long lines – Nov. 4</p>
<p>I felt quite well first thing Wednesday morning, although my muscles were aching. I thought it was from raking leaves.</p>
<p>All this changed when I began to read this front page story. My coffee grew cold and I started to feel ill as I came across our premier’s dire warning. Dalton McGuinty, who has a long record of telling the truth, advised all Ontarians that it was "absolutely essential" to get the H1N1 flu vaccination. These are very scary words.</p>
<p>As a person who cannot remember when I last had influenza, it was very unsettling to learn that my life would be in grave danger if I chose not to get the H1N1 shot. In my ignorance I believed that there was a greater likelihood of getting killed en route to the clinic, or dropping over dead after standing in line for hours, than dying from the pandemic.</p>
<p>Please come clean Mr. Premier, and don’t keep the public in the dark any longer. When we get all the essential facts, most of us are likely to line-up out of fear.</p>
<p>Could it be that one of these essential facts (for McGuinty) is that the way things are unfolding, there may be a large surplus of H1N1 vaccine that has been paid for, and will have to be dumped? What a political boondoggle that would be.</p>

<p>Mismanaging this flu crisis - Nov. 4</p>
<p>After reading your front page article on H1N1 clinics I thought I would write a letter to the editor. However, turning to the editorial page, I see you beat me to it. Amen!</p>
<p>Can you imagine what would happen if we had a genuine 1918 variety of flu pandemic on our hands? This boggles my mind.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that our public health officials are probably more concerned, on a day by day basis, with budgets than they are with planning and delivering health care. I'm not being facetious. I spoke with a hospital worker recently who was worried about a layoff due to H1N1. The hospital has to absorb all the extra cost associated with the flu and may be forced to reduce payroll as a result.</p>
<p>I guess that makes sense.</p>

<p>It is funny how the people who are parked on a street for a short time to get the required H1N1 shot at a recent flu clinic should return to their cars to find a parking ticket.</p>
<p>We have a huge issue on our street with vehicles parked sometimes for days on end, contrary to Waterloo parking bylaws that clearly state no overnight parking and a three hour maximum time limit, that are overlooked or ignored by city bylaw officers. We constantly call the bylaw office to report these vehicles, but are fed endless excuses and these cars go left unchecked for days. A lot of times we have vehicles park on both sides of the street making it hard for emergency vehicles to get through safely.</p>
<p>Where is the fairness in this?</p>

<p>Federal government? Provincial government? They all fail with H1N1.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks as everyone looks to lay blame for the current state of confusion over the H1N1 vaccine, let's keep in mind the clinics were here and open, but the vaccines got lost in the shuffle.</p>
<p>I think the Conservative federal government has a huge responsibility over the lack of vaccines available, as it is their responsibility to supply it to the provinces. Not too long ago we were hearing the promise of a vaccine for every Canadian who wanted one. Well I want one, and I can't seem to find one.</p>
<p>The Ontario Liberal government did something right by offering clinics throughout the province, and at locations with large populations, such as campuses. It's hardly their fault that the vaccines they were promised never showed up.</p>
<p>The issue I do have is with the vaccines ending up at local doctors' offices, who in turn have little interest in vaccinating their patients. Ultimately, family and friends of people not meeting the priority group requirements are being vaccinated simply because they know someone who works in a doctor's office.</p>
<p>How about some accountability for the few vaccinations we did receive, that they actually did reach those high priority groups.</p>

<p>Crews battle blaze after explosion at battery plant</p>
<p>Fire crews battled through the night late Saturday to contain a blaze at a battery recycling and electronics waste plant and nearby recycling company south of Trail, B.C. RCMP said stored lithium batteries exploded after a fire started in a small underground building at the Toxco plant, and the flames quickly spread next door to bundles of plastic and cardboard at Alpine Recycling. Police said Toxco advised that sulphur dioxide gas that had been given off during the fire did not pose any risk to the public, as it dissipated into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>A 33-year-old Toronto man is scheduled to appear in court today charged in the city's 48th homicide of the year. James Chalaturnyk is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 67-year-old Gerald Robert Brown at a home in Yorkville. When police arrived at the scene on Wednesday, they say they found that the retired dentist had suffered obvious signs of trauma. An autopsy Thursday determined he died from a sharp force wound to the neck. Chalaturnyk was arrested on Friday.</p>

<p>Man upset after daughter gets double dose of H1N1 vaccine</p>
<p>A Brampton father is upset to learn his daughter is among almost a dozen children in Brampton who received double the recommended dose of the H1N1 flu vaccine. Ted Hedrich says his three-year-old daughter, Selena, was one of 11 children who were mistakenly given the higher dose by a nurse. Hedrich told Toronto television station Citytv that his daughter is at high risk for the H1N1 flu, so he and his wife decided she should be vaccinated, but now they're torn about whether it was the right decision. Within an hour, someone caught the nurse's error, but Hedrich says he wasn't notified until three days later and adds his daughter woke up sick with flu-like symptoms the day after getting the vaccine.</p>

<p>Report says lottery corporation awarded untendered contracts</p>
<p>There's a report that the scandal-plagued <span class="companylink">Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp</span>. awarded $5.5 million in untendered consulting contracts over two years. The Toronto Star cites internal documents as saying the province's gambling agency signed 52 sole-sourced contracts for things such as a "prize integrity program" from 2007 until this year. Following Ontario Ombud Andre Marin's 2007 report into suspicious insider wins by convenience store owners and others, the lottery monopoly was forced to beef up its regulations. The newspaper quotes a Finance Ministry official as saying the commission's untendered contract use increased so it could comply with new regulations. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said she wasn't surprised to hear of the extent of untendered contracts at OLG.</p>

<p>Man in stable condition</p>

<p>A 27-year-old man is recovering in hospital after he was shot by a Regina police officer. Investigators said officers were called early Sunday morning to a central-area home where a man inside was reportedly waving around a long-barrelled gun and threatening people. When they arrived, they found a man with a gun in the backyard. "He was given instructions to drop the weapon but did not follow police commands," police Chief Troy Hagen told reporters several hours after the shooting. "At approximately 12:15 a.m., a Regina police officer discharged their firearm." Police said one shot was fired, striking the man in the torso. He was taken to hospital where he was listed in stable condition. His name has not been released and there is no indication whether he will face charges.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Past pandemics suggest H1N1 may not have peaked</b>
</div><div>By Helen Branswell and Malcolm McNeil   </div>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>As delivery of H1N1 vaccine to the provinces ramps up this week after an unfortunate slowdown, some public health officials are warning that Canadians shouldn't decide they can do without vaccine just because they've made it this far.</p>
<p>Though a wave of infection appears to be peaking in some parts of the country and is perhaps past its peak in others, the virus still could have plenty up its sleeve, they say. In parts of the southern U.S. where flu activity had started to decline there are signs another upsurge in infections is coming, influenza epidemiologist Lone Simonsen said Sunday.</p>
<p>Simonsen, who teaches at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., has done extensive study of the wave patterns of previous pandemics.</p>
<p>"In '57 … we certainly had a fall wave followed immediately by a winter wave. And then we had the same pattern in 1918," she says, adding that in the pandemic of 1889, the bulk of the deaths occurred in the third wave. "It would not be surprising … if there was another wave here this winter."</p>
<p>New estimates posted online Sunday by the Public Health Agency of Canada suggest that 1,993,800 doses of vaccine will be shipped to provinces this week, just under half of which will be without adjuvant.</p>
<p>The adjuvant-free product was purchased for use in pregnant women, though it's likely the country will have excess. Late last week Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said it wasn't yet determined to whom the remainder of the unadjuvanted vaccine will be offered.</p>
<p>The estimates suggest that by the end of this week 8,568,200 doses of vaccine will have been shipped to provinces and territories, enough to vaccinate 25 per cent of Canadians. A Canadian Press Harris-Decima poll released last week suggested 55 per cent of Canadians intended to be vaccinated against the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Critics of the way the vaccine program has been handled have said the vaccine is coming too late. Dr. Richard Schabas, a former chief medical officer for Ontario, said last week that H1N1 will be a "distant memory" by Christmas and there will be no value in immunizing healthy people.</p>
<p>His view isn't shared by Dr. Alain Poirier, Quebec's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>"People are saying, the vaccinations are being done too late," Poirier said late last week. "But every person vaccinated is another person protected. Often there's a third wave and we could have that in February or March - we don't know."</p>

</p>
<p>With the arrival of not just the flu season, but the pandemic flu season, it's no surprise that workplaces are struggling with policies and the interpretation of them surrounding calling in sick and related issues.</p>
<p>Within the ranks of the teachers at the Upper Grand District School Board, the H1N1 onslaught and a new teacher attendance program have seemingly combined to become a union-management issue.</p>
<p>The policy stipulates that teachers who are absent for four or more days between October and February and have cumulative absences of five or more days during the previous six months may be obliged to have a meeting with their principal. The union is concerned the policy may frighten teachers into not using their sick days. The board asserts it's not a punitive policy but one that is designed to "maximize dollars around supply teacher coverage."</p>
<p>The school board has every right to seek to limit overspending on supply teacher expenses. We suspect any Upper Grand teacher with legitimate illness will have every support they require when it comes to utilizing their sick day benefits. If Upper Grand teachers feel they are subjected to unwarranted attention or discipline for taking sick days during days they were ill, they should grieve those instances. Under those circumstances, they should expect a favourable outcome – particularly as employers and the public defer further to a stay-home-if-you're-sick ethos amid the H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>Notifying the school board of your decision to take a sick day is a simple matter. Teachers merely do so online.</p>
<p>Making it that easy – ending the days of actually calling in sick – has apparently corresponded with a spike in teachers taking sick days and in supply teacher costs escalating. That should cause both sides to reflect on whether this system invites any over-use.</p>
<p>No one seems to be suggesting the system has to return to calling in on sick days – or that teacher sick days ought to be clawed back. Is it suggesting that employees off for a spell of days might need to check in with their manager upon their return all that threatening? We're not of that mindset.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mozart's Magic done just right; Characters easy to relate to, chuckle at</b>
</div><div>ARTHUR KAPTAINIS   </div>
<div>FREELANCE</div>
<div>509 words</div><div>9 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A20 / BREAK</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>After opening the season with a stoutly Italian double bill, the Opéra de Montréal stepped back a century on Saturday night to present Mozart's The Magic Flute, a work as far away from the verismo concept as can be imagined. Yet what came across in Place des Arts was a fable of appealing simplicity, made of characters and situations that were easy to relate to and chuckle at.</p>
<p>Eye-popping sets are expected from this fanciful opera, and the colourful Never Never Land created by David Hockney for the San Francisco Opera did not disappoint. Temples and doorways were pleasing in their geometry and the animals summoned by the title instrument (think of exotic variants of pantomime horses) were true to the naivete of the presentation.</p>
<p>Indeed, Canadian director Kelly Robinson, uninfected by the postmodern swine flu, understood that telling the story clearly was the best way of liberating its deeper messages concerning courage, honour and love. Papageno's comedy was sweetly underlined but we never lost sight of the journey of Tamino from evil to redemption as the fundamental trajectory of the story.</p>
<p>Casting was up to what we can now confidently call OdM standards. Soprano Karina Gauvin as Pamina was in golden voice and projected an unerring sense of line. The aria Ach, ich fuhl's can slow down the narrative if dully done. Here it was an oasis of melancholy.</p>
<p>Tenor John Tessier, a little restrained in the first act, was a dignified Tamino. Aaron St. Clair Nicholson, with a firm rather than rich baritone, played Papageno with the requisite athleticism and a gift for comic timing. His halfhearted threats to hang himself were particularly amusing. Give him a medal also for best vocal performance with his head upside down.</p>
<p>Coloratura Aline Kutan wielded a brilliant technique as The Queen of the Night and the German bass-baritone Reinhard Hagen (the sole non-Canadian among the majors) was grand and authoritative as Sarastro. Given the current unpopularity of the patriarchal views this High Priest espouses, a sympathetic stage presence is mandatory.</p>
<p>The Orchestre métropolitain sounded muted in the great overture, but the focus from the pit improved by the second act. Alain Trudel, making his company debut, cut the singers plenty of slack. Tempos were never pushed.</p>
<p>Nor was anything overstated. The climactic trial of fire and water, disarmingly straightforward, got a chuckle from the crowd. If only the difficulties of real life were so easily overcome!</p>
<p>Well, maybe they can be. Anyone seeking layers of meanings in The Magic Flute are welcome to seek them in this balanced and agreeable presentation.</p>
<p>The Magic Flute repeats Wednesday, Saturday, and on Nov. 16 and 19 at 8 p.m. There is also a matinée Nov. 21 at 2 p.m.</p>

</p>
<p>As Canadians roll up their sleeves for the H1N1 and regular flu vaccination, there will likely be a few faces in the long lineups cringing at the thought of what's to come -- perhaps not the vaccine itself, but the delivery method.</p>
<p>Needles have been known to elicit tears and even fainting episodes among those queasy, anxious or fearful about being pricked. And experts say festering thoughts of potential imminent pain from a shot could weigh on some people's decisions about whether to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>"I think people may have concerns about vaccines for a variety of reasons, but pain and the actual fear of getting the injection is often the barrier that prevents people from getting the vaccine," said pediatric psychologist Christine Chambers based at Dalhousie University.</p>
<p>"Certainly people who are anxious in general are more likely to be fearful about other consequences and other side-effects that they see might be associated with the vaccine."</p>
<p>Five to 10 per cent of people will admit to not getting vaccinated because of pain, said Anna Taddio, an adjunct scientist and pharmacist at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children.</p>
<p>"It's going to be some way for someone to easily dismiss getting the vaccine because they're afraid of the needle," said Taddio. "So if we can treat the pain, if we can prevent pain, we can probably also increase people's willingness to get a vaccine."</p>
<p>Clinical psychologist John Walker with the University of Manitoba, said among the people he sees, the concern tends to be centred more on the needle than its contents.</p>
<p>"Some of these people will actually even faint if they need to give a blood sample to a family doctor or (if) they need to have an injection," he said. "Part of the treatment involves teaching them how to handle that.</p>
<p>For Walker, that involves having individuals understand both the problem and the thinking and emotion that goes with it, as well as learning how to face fears in gradual steps.</p>
<p>One possible option is visualization and having someone imagine receiving an injection or watching someone else receiving one.</p>
<p>"You try to break a problem that seems quite overwhelming into smaller steps."</p>
<p>Chambers and Taddio say there are strategies that can help effectively reduce pain as well as anxiety, particularly among young people.</p>
<p>Chambers recommends parents purchase a topical anesthetic cream that can significantly reduce pain.</p>
<p>Taddio suggests applying a numbing cream 30 minutes beforehand -- a cream that uses the same chemicals dentists use in patients' mouths.</p>
<p>For infants, breastfeeding during injections can help reduce pain. Distracting a child's attention away from pain could include talking to or giving small toys to babies and young kids, or bringing a small DVD player or iPod along.</p>
<p>Taddio said it's beneficial for children four and up to know about the needle beforehand because explaining what's going to happen will help to prepare them.</p>
<p>"Children might ... say, 'Is this going to hurt?' And you'd say, 'Well for some kids they say it's not comfortable. Other kids don't mind it at all. We don't know how it's going to be for you but we're going to have some things that we do to make it not bother you.'"</p>
<p>Chambers said what doesn't work is parents reassuring or apologizing to children during medical procedures.</p>
<p>"What we encourage parents to do is to use distraction and to try to avoid saying things like, 'It will be over soon,' 'Don't worry,' 'I'm sorry this is happening,'" she said. "Those types of things tend to make kids feel worse."</p>

<p>Re: 'Jumping H1N1 queues is Titanic misjudgment' (Letters, Nov. 5)</p>
<p>I am amazed that perfectly healthy people jumped right in front of needy people in this day and age. This pandemic should be called chicken flu.</p>
<p>The government and health-care institutions have made it perfectly clear the shots were for those most at risk. They even printed priority lists of conditions or ailments. The healthy people knew exactly what they were doing.</p>
<p>After the vaccines are completed, I think we should use this army of health care workers to start calling family doctors. If a perfectly healthy person received a shot within the first few weeks of the program, they can pay. This is the only fair way to do it. How about $500 per healthy person? This will recover some of the lost money on this campaign and it will teach all the line-jumpers a good lesson.</p>

<p>Re: 'Jumping H1N1 queues is Titanic misjudgment' (Letters, Nov. 5)</p>
<p>There has been criticism of healthy people getting vaccines, when only people with pre-existing chronic illnesses should go.</p>
<p>I realize H1N1 has caused stress and anxiety, but why think the worst of people? Does anyone know what a person who has asthma looks like? They look healthy, but they would be at high risk if they caught H1N1 because this flu affects the respiratory system.</p>
<p>There are many people with other chronic illness who look fine and who are able to work, but their immune systems and bodies are much more fragile when challenged by viruses and bacteria. A young woman in line may not tell you she has MS, and a critical look would be most unfair.</p>
<p>From what I've read, most deaths from H1N1 have occurred in people with pre-existing conditions. Why should these people with pre-existing illness be criticized when they stand in line just because they look well on the outside?</p>
<p>Respect for each other and understanding is what is required, not speculation and finger-pointing.</p>

</p>
<p>Re: 'Leafs, Raptors deny jumping lines for flu shot' (Nov. 5)</p>
<p>The Toronto Maple Leafs recently issued a statement saying they were only following medical protocol by having their players get the H1N1 flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Whose medical protocol were they following? The team's or the Ontario health minister's? The health minister has made it very clear the only people who should be getting vaccinated right now are those in high-risk groups.</p>
<p>Does a healthy, young, male athlete really need this shot more than a pregnant woman, or a young child at high risk of dying from this virus?</p>
<p>If a Leafs or Raptors player was to get the H1N1 virus, chances are he wouldn't be able to play until he recovered.</p>
<p>But if a pregnant woman was to get H1N1, there's a very good chance that the virus will cause irreparable damage to the baby and/or the mother.</p>
<p>Is being able to play that game really more important than the health and lives of people in these high-risk groups?</p>
<p>If "heavy travel requirements" are used as an argument as to why professional sports players should be in a high-risk group, what about international businessmen? They do an equal amount of travelling, if not more. Is their health not of equal importance?</p>
<p>I am a 17-year-old, healthy, male high-school student. I would never consider getting the H1N1 flu vaccine until I knew that everyone in these high-risk groups has been vaccinated. As far as I know, at this point we are far from obtaining that goal.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>A man from Brampton questions why the nurse who gave his young daughter and almost a dozen other children double the recommended dose of the H1N1 flu vaccine is still giving out the flu shot.</p>
<p>The man's child is feeling ill but has not been diagnosed with flu or H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>It's just the latest problem to surface in Ontario's bumpy rollout of the swine flu vaccine.</p>
<p>That start has included vaccine shortages, days-long lineups for vaccinations at public clinics and board members at about a dozen Toronto hospitals being allowed to jump the queue.</p>
<p>Ted Hedrich said in an interview from his home in Brampton he was told his three-and-a-half-year-old daughter was one of 11 children who were given the higher dose by a nurse. But he wasn't called by a Peel Public Health supervisor until Thursday when he was told of the error, he said.</p>
<p>Health officials have recommended young children only get half the adult dose initially -- which would be 0.25 mL for children -- and then get the other half several weeks later. But Hedrich said his daughter was given 0.5 mL.</p>
<p>Hedrich said he was told the nurse now has been retrained on the proper procedure.</p>
<p>"I was absolutely shocked," he said, that the nurse was still giving flu shots.</p>
<p>He took the child to their family physician and was told to take her for X-rays because she had a "slight rasp" in her chest, he said, adding she hasn't felt well since getting the vaccine. Peel region's associate medical officer of health, Dr. Kathleen Dooling, said there are no significant ill effects found for children at that dosage level.</p>
<p>Peel region is investigating how the error occurred.</p>

</p>
<p>St. Joseph's Healthcare is now grappling with possible H1N1 outbreaks in two of the wards at its West 5th campus, which delivers specialized mental health services.</p>
<p>The hospital said four patients in its D2 ward, along with two patients and five staff members in its H2 ward, are experiencing flu-like symptoms. There has been one confirmed case of H1N1 on the H2 ward.</p>
<p>As a precautionary measure, both wards have been declared outbreak sites. An earlier staff outbreak at St. Joseph's Healthcare emergency department is now over.</p>
<p>The moves come at the same time as news Hamilton's two assessment centres could close as early as the end of next weekend if numbers continue to drop.</p>
<p>Dr. David McCann, director of the centres, said the east-end clinic was still quite busy on the weekend, although not as much as it had been. The volume at the west end clinic diminished quite a bit.</p>
<p>"It indicates that there's still a significant burden of disease in Hamilton, but more people are choosing to shelter at home and are not as worried as they were, say two weeks ago, after the sudden demise of those two children," McCann said.</p>
<p>Dr. Ninh Tran, Hamilton associate medical officer of health, said some things, such as school absenteeism and outbreaks, have improved. But there's still a lot of activity around the illness.</p>
<p>At Hamilton Health Sciences, there's been a decrease in those presenting with H1N1, and the hospital says it's holding its own when it comes to staff infection. No outbreaks have been declared at HHS.</p>
<p>At its peak, the hospital's daily volume jumped as high as 75 per cent above normal. That number has dropped to 15 to 20 per cent.</p>
<p>This past week, there was a slight increase in emergency room volume for St. Joe's, but it was still being described as manageable. During the outbreak at St. Joe's, healthy visitors will still be able to visit healthy patients in the designated room in the unit.</p>

<p>Halton Region has closed its H1N1 clinics because of a vaccine shortage, but Hamilton is confident its supply will carry the city through today at least.</p>
<p>Dr. Ninh Tran, Hamilton's associate medical officer of health, said how long the remaining vaccine lasts depends on the uptake early in the week and how many providers are requesting it.</p>
<p>Hamilton is expecting a new shipment of vaccine from the province late tomorrow or Wednesday.</p>
<p>Halton said if the province receives vaccine today, the region could get its allotment as early as tomorrow and reopen the clinics Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We still have some left, and that at least for the next few days we would still be able to fill family physician orders, but we really do have to wait for more vaccine from the province, who get it from the feds," said Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton's medical officer of health.</p>
<p>By end of day yesterday, Halton had immunized nearly 42,000 people. The region was given 73,000 H1N1 vaccine doses. Hamilton received 81,500 doses.</p>
<p>Tran said he thinks there will be an announcement shortly about giving the shot to more people.</p>
<p>"I expect that sometime this week that it will be opened up to additional groups, but probably not to the entire general public," he said.</p>
<p>Halton will open a clinic tomorrow for pregnant women who want the unadjuvanted vaccine. The site at the Halton Regional Centre will offer the shot from 4 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>The region is advising people to check its website, halton.ca, for clinic updates. Residents can also call 311 for information.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 making moral leadership hard</b>
</div><div>Andrew Potter   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>923 words</div><div>9 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>(From The Ottawa Citizen, November 10, 2009) Apology: A column on page A10 Monday incorrectly stated that Gerald Schwartz, the chairman and CEO of Onex Corporation, was among the members of the board of Toronto’s Mount Sinai Hospital who received the H1N1 vaccination. Mr. Schwartz has not received the vaccination, and the Citizen apologizes to him for this error. ***** </p>
<p>One of the main functions of a queue is to ration a scarce good or service in a way that everyone accepts as justified. Whether it is in line for a teller at the bank, where access is based on the principle of first come, first served, or in the triage lineup in a hospital emergency room, where priority is given to those in the direst condition, the queue is seen as enforcing the principles of fairness and equality. No special treatment to the rich or to VIPs, or to put it in the moral vernacular of the schoolyard, "no budding."</p>
<p>Yet there are other times when queues are for suckers and chumps, as anyone who has ever stood in line outside a hot nightclub can attest. The proles wait forever, while the attractive and the well-connected stroll past the bouncer with a wave. In these cases, the purpose of the line is to underscore just how exclusive the place is, and to emphasize the two-tier nature of access.</p>
<p>One of the central promises of Canada's universal single-payer health-care system is that the waiting lists are of the first type. But as testified by the anger over successive revelations over queue-jumping for the H1N1 vaccine by professional hockey teams and hospital board members, Canadians are realizing that in many respects, their health-care system functions more like a nightclub than an emergency room.</p>
<p>The most egregious case is that of the Calgary Flames, who -- along with their families and staff, 150 people in all -- received their vaccinations in private, far from the desperate lineups at the mass public immunization clinics. But even as Alberta was busy firing the two public health workers responsible, the scandal rolled eastward. This weekend, it was reported that board members of at least seven Toronto hospitals were vaccinated out of turn, while the top 200 donors to the Jewish General in Montreal, along with various board members, were fast-tracked.</p>
<p>Of course, in every case there are apologists for the budders. In Alberta, the leader of the provincial NDP blamed the "climate of confusion" surrounding who was eligible for the vaccine. At Mount Sinai in Toronto, chief microbiologist Dr. Don Low apologized for giving vaccinations to board members including Gerald Schwartz, head of <span class="companylink">Onex Corp</span>., and Lawrence Tanenbaum, chair of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd., saying that it seemed like "the right thing to do" at the time. And in Montreal, Jewish General officials claimed that the vaccinated donors all volunteered in some capacity at the hospital, and that their priority vaccination had nothing to do with the fact that they gave money.</p>
<p>All of this budding might be excusable if the public had any guarantee that these are special circumstances, but as anyone who spends any time trying to navigate Canadian health care soon realizes, there is a considerable amount of "flexibility" in the system. Contacts, social connections, even a bottle of scotch put in the right hands, can open the door to more timely, effective care.</p>
<p>The H1N1 difficulties aside, confidence in the system remains high. A Nanos research poll conducted for Montreal's Institute for Research on Public Policy released last week found that 80 per cent of Canadians gave their unqualified support to our universal, single-payer health-care system. And while lengthy wait times was named as the key weakness of the system, only three per cent of respondents cited fraud or abuse of the system as a problem.</p>
<p>Of course, the polling was conducted before the vaccination queue-jumping stories broke, and our collective support for the system might have flagged since then. Regardless, line-jumping matters because the more people start to believe that others are gaming the system, the less incentive anyone has to play by the rules. In a disturbing study conducted by a Toronto emergency-room doctor two years ago, 95 per cent of respondents said that while they supported the principles of fairness and equal access, 71 per cent conceded that they would pull strings -- from paying bribes to calling in favours -- to get moved ahead on waiting lists.</p>
<p>As the lead author of the study, Dr. Steven Marc Friedman, told the Citizen: "As the system is under more and more strain, people will do what they have to do."</p>
<p>It is at times of crisis, when there is a great deal of fear, uncertainty and confusion, that the wealthy and the connected are most able to exploit their status and privilege and push to the front of the line. It is instructive to remember that while almost two-thirds of first-class passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic, only a quarter of those in third class were rescued.</p>
<p>But it is precisely at such times when our elites have to show moral leadership and a commitment to the virtues of social solidarity. After all, if this is how they behave in what amounts to a fairly minor health-care crisis, one shudders to think how quickly they'll abandon us when things get really serious.</p>

<p>Corporations love being associated with superstar athletes, big-time movie stars or popular rock bands. But H1N1?</p>
<p>The global H1N1 flu pandemic is proving to be a marketing bonanza for many companies that have turned the virus into a sponsorship frenzy.</p>
<p>From trade conventions to baseball games, mixed martial arts fights and even the Vancouver Olympics, business is booming for corporate sponsorships tied to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>On Monday, California-based Bio-Clean Inc. announced it is sponsoring Randy (The Natural) Couture in his upcoming Ultimate Fighting Championship match against Brandon Vera. The company said the sponsorship would be an excellent way to showcase its Clean Kill hand sanitizer which, it added, “is the world's best choice in the battle against H1N1.”</p>
<p>“The company believes that Randy (The Natural) Couture embodies the All-American image of strength and intelligence that Bio-Clean's Clean Kill Personal Hand Sanitizing Weapon is designed to portray,” Bio-Clean said in a press release.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, Terry Owen said few people had ever heard of his company, ALDA PharmaceuticalsCorp., when it signed a sponsorship deal last summer with the Vancouver Olympics.</p>
<p>The deal made ALDA the first “official supplier of hand sanitizers and disinfectant cleaning products for the Games,” according to Olympic organizers. Now Mr. Owen said ALDA can barely keep up with demand for its T36 hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>“With the H1N1 pandemic coming at the same time [as the sponsorship deal] and there being kind of a shortage of hand sanitizers in the market right now, everything has really kind of aligned in our favour,” Mr. Owen said Monday. “Nobody had heard of us and we went basically from zero to hero overnight with the [Olympic] sponsorship. It was a huge big deal for us.”</p>
<p>Fear of H1N1 and other potential health hazards prompted organizers of the 2010 Cable Show in Los Angeles to offer a sponsorship spot for the convention's “official hand sanitizer.”</p>
<p>For $20,000 (U.S.), “your brand appears on individual-size hand sanitizer bottles distributed at registration and the information kiosks throughout the convention centre,” the organizers said on the website of the convention, which brings together hundreds of cable television and telecommunications companies. “It's a novel and highly appreciated sponsorship vehicle that will keep you top of mind (and close at hand) throughout the show.”</p>
<p>Convention planner MaryBeth Powers, who runs Virginia-based Planning Powers, offers “H1N1 sponsorship ideas” on her website. “Sponsors can benefit from the worries of Swine Flu (H1N1),” she says. “Have your sponsors donate personal-size antibacterial gel bottles, wipes and/or a packet of tissues. Your meeting attendees will love them.”</p>
<p>Then there's Vi-Jon Inc., a St. Louis-based company that makes Germ-X hand sanitizers. The company not only features extensive material about H1N1 on its website, but also sponsored a bike race this year, with Germ-X as the official hand sanitizer, and ran ads during broadcasts of St. Louis Cardinals baseball games featuring the product as the team's “preferred hand sanitizer.”</p>
<p>“When it comes to fighting germs, you have to play hardball,” the team's play-by-play announcer John Rooney said in the ads.</p>
<p>“That's why I use Germ-X, the instant hand sanitizer. I just apply Germ-X to my hands, rub it in for 15 seconds, then I'm ready to throw germs out at the plate.”</p>

<p>It's a sport in which the players shake hands before and after the game.</p>
<p>And the H1N1 outbreak won't change that tradition at the Canadian Olympic Trials curling pre-qualifier, which kicks off Tuesday at the CN Centre in Prince George, B.C.</p>
<p>Rest assured, there will far more precautions taken when it comes to shaking those hands.</p>
<p>"I don't think anybody would be offended if you shake somebody's hand, then walk over to get the (hand sanitizer), wipe your hands down and away you go," Winnipeg's Jeff Stoughton said with a laugh. "I don't think the handshakes should go away; it's just part of the tradition of the game."</p>
<p>Beyond that, teams will take other precautions. Some are bringing sanitary wipes with them to ice level and will give the handles of their curling rocks a quick clean before games.</p>
<p>As well, players will be given individually labelled metal water bottles, and will be responsible for keeping them safe and out of the way.</p>
<p>The biggest change, though, will come off the ice. It's a tradition that teams appear at autograph sessions to mingle with fans, but there will be different protocols in place in Prince George, and likely at the <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> Olympic Trials next month in Edmonton, said Danny Lamoureux, the Canadian Curling Association's director of championship services.</p>
<p>"The autograph sessions will be handshake-free, and we'll have a spotter near the lineup (to watch for sickly fans), and a sign that says if you have the flu or flu-like symptoms, please tell us whose autograph you'd like and we'll get it for you," said Lamoureux. "If the pandemic escalates, then we'll have to go to another set of procedures."</p>
<p>Calgary's Heather Rankin, who's legendary in curling circles for her love of interacting with fans, said she won't change a thing heading into Prince George.</p>
<p>"I'm going to shake hands, I'm going to high-five, I'm going to do what I normally do with the crowd," she vowed. "I'm not worried about getting the flu. I have a strong immune system, as do my teammates. And I think the social aspect is the one strong reason that curling is different than other sports, and if the curlers stay away from the fans, that's a sad, sad day."</p>

<p>Re: "Flu may claim bigger political victims; Credibility gap widens between Albertans and Conservatives," by Graham Thomson, Nov. 5.</p>
<p>I have to wonder why one race is preferentially treated over another when it comes to the H1N1 vaccine, for being on a reserve is indeed being distinguished by race.</p>
<p>I have heard the various arguments about First Nations being disadvantaged and I don't find them valid. White people from trailer parks will face many of the same traditional hardships without the benefits of free education, priority for disease prevention and free housing. And many of the members from the wealthy reserves will never face these hardships.</p>
<p>The primary issues I see here are socioeconomic disparity and not founded in racial differences. I think that the preferential treatment of vaccinating reserves first demonstrates a valuation of one race's lives as more significant then another. By putting all other Canadians at a disadvantage, this promotes resentment in the general populace.</p>
<p>How are we supposed to move away from racism, when race is still being used as a criterion?</p>

<p>I have called Health Link numerous times and visited their website to get information about the seasonal flu shot. While understandably the focus is on H1N1 vaccination, I feel Health Link needs to address the seasonal flu shot clearly.</p>
<p>Health Link says watch the website or call them daily. But no one really knows what has happened to the seasonal flu shots or when they will be coming back.</p>
<p>Many Albertans work in high-risk situations and need both vaccines.</p>

<p>Over the past week, it has become increasingly challenging to find a ray of light in the provincial government's execution of the H1N1 vaccine campaign. On the one hand, is fortunate that many have taken the issue of H1N1 seriously and sought vaccination; alternately, initial neglect to acknowledge scientific evidence supporting priority protection of high-risk groups placed both the health of vulnerable populations and capacity of the health-care system to handle these groups if H1N1 related illness in jeopardy. Now, the Flames controversy is the latest disturbance in this purported flu fiasco.</p>
<p>Following much discussion about "Flamegate," one of the most interesting rebuttals I have heard is, "If someone came and offered you the vaccination at your work site, wouldn't you just take it?" It may be simple human nature to accept.</p>
<p>However, the Flames' case is exceptional. Media coverage of lineups was overwhelming. Furthermore, there were suggestions of an impending shortage of the vaccine. What was more inflammatory was the fact that the players' families also received the vaccine, while across the province many pregnant women and mothers with infants waited hours in line.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate is that there is no evidence of any Flame questioning the ethics of receiving special treatment in this event.</p>
<p>Without doubt, these players have worked diligently to earn their privileged place in society. But, with privilege comes responsibility, much of which is manifested in leadership.</p>
<p>Had even one player contested the process, would the Flames be heralded as heroes for setting a precedent of how pro sports teams can be social agents for demonstrating fairness and integrity?</p>

<p>The government's decision not to identify the health official who allowed the Calgary Flames and their family members to receive the H1N1 vaccine before high-risk Albertans raises questions for me. Because I do not know who was responsible, I have no way of knowing if this is just a feel-good PR exercise for the Alberta government.</p>

<p>Many people will get the H1N1 vaccine. At this time, there are only five medical centres in Edmonton offering the H1N1 shot. This has caused long lineups and wait times.</p>
<p>The lineups could have been reduced if the vaccine was only given to the high-risk groups first. Also, the paperwork should have been filled out beforehand, with the necessary identification, for those who fall into the high-risk category.</p>
<p>It is now reported that medical centres are running low on the vaccine. This whole mess could have been avoided if Alberta Health Services had let high-risk groups be vaccinated first.</p>
<p>It is important that the public remains calm, as there will be more vaccine shipped in. This will speed up the process.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Nation made wrong flu call: expert; Pandemic flu strain found in 99.7 per cent of cases; doctor says seasonal shots delayed H1N1 vaccine by 6 weeks</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>960 words</div><div>9 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>With H1N1 now accounting for virtually all of the flu being diagnosed in Canada, critics say Canada was wrong not to have halted production of the regular seasonal flu shots and switched production to H1N1 vaccine sooner.</p>
<p>"I believe that if they had made the bold and courageous decision to follow the evidence, and abandon the seasonal flu vaccine, that we could have had our H1N1 vaccine about six weeks earlier," says Dr. Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"The consequence of that is that we've got lots of seasonal flu vaccine, but no seasonal flu, and not enough H1N1 vaccine, and lots of H1N1," Schabas said. "It's backwards."</p>
<p>For the week ending Oct. 31, a total of 7,970 specimens tested positive for influenza. Overall, 99.7 per cent were pandemic H1N1, and infections and hospitalizations have been increasing.</p>
<p>Schabas said there were early signals H1N1 would be the dominant strain this flu season.</p>
<p>A phenomenon known as "strain replacement," where the new virus replaces old ones that had been circulating, is a classic characteristic of a pandemic virus.</p>
<p>"That's what happened in 1918, it's what happened in 1957 and it's what happened in 1968," says Schabas, now medical officer of health for Ontario's Hastings and Prince Edward Counties Health Unit.</p>
<p>Most provinces and territories have delayed all or parts of their regular seasonal influenza programs until after the H1N1 vaccination campaign is complete.</p>
<p>In the Southern Hemisphere, where the flu season runs from April to September, H1N1 began to be prevalent in May, and then increasingly became the predominant strain.</p>
<p>"There was strong reason to believe that there would be strain replacement, that we would not see significant levels of seasonal flu activity this year," Schabas said. He said enough seasonal flu vaccine could have been produced to offer immunization to people over 65, and those with chronic diseases who are at high risk of flu complications, before shifting production to targeting H1N1.</p>
<p>"The best time to immunize is before the outbreak starts. We're not going to actually be able to even offer the vaccine to healthy people until the outbreaks are largely over, at least in many parts of the country," Schabas said.</p>
<p>"That, to my mind, makes it inappropriate to be immunizing healthy people, at least in those parts of Canada where the outbreaks are already past the peaks," he said.</p>
<p>"By the time we're able to offer it in Ontario, this outbreak will be past its peak in Ontario."</p>
<p>Canada's top doctor said that when the decision was made in July to keep producing seasonal flu shots, some countries in the Southern Hemisphere were seeing as much seasonal influenza as H1N1.</p>
<p>"Once you stop the seasonal flu production, it is done," Dr. David Butler-Jones said at a recent media briefing.</p>
<p>"It meant...a short delay, in the H1N1 production, but it also means that we have, and will have seasonal flu vaccine for all those who need and want it as well.</p>
<p>"You would not want to be in a situation where, if we'd stopped it, we'd run out so we can't actually immunize against seasonal flu, and we have people seriously ill and dying from seasonal flu."</p>
<p>Earl Brown, a University of Ottawa virologist, said it was not clear in the summer whether H1N1 would come back hard. As well, there were early problems with the seed strains used to grow the virus to produce the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>"The first ones were bad and the next ones weren't much better, and they had to work at it to get something that was even acceptable," said Brown, executive director of the Emerging Pathogens Research Centre at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>"Even if they said, 'Let's stop now and go,' they weren't ready to go. If they had stopped annual flu production, they would have been sitting there on their hands, with idle factories without any seasonal flu (vaccine)."</p>
<p>Seasonal flu epidemics typically last six to eight weeks, starting in December or January. The second wave of H1N1 appears to have begun about two weeks ago. But experts caution there isn't a pattern that is strong enough to predict where we are with H1N1.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization reported Friday that "intense and persistent" flu spread continues to be reported in North America, without evidence of a peak in activity. According to WHO, the proportion of doctors visits due to flu-like illness has exceeded levels seen over the past six flu seasons.</p>
<p>Typically flu infects about 10 per cent of the population each year. In the 1918 influenza pandemic, half the North American population was infected.</p>
<p>"We don't know how many people have been infected, or how this thing is going to go," Brown says.</p>
<p>But Brown cautions hysteria can drive people to the doctor when they don't need to go. "You have to be careful in reading the things you normally use as signifiers, because sometimes they're skewed because of behaviour changes.</p>
<p>"The things you can't fake are the hospitalizations and the ICU(admissions). You can't fake an ICU. You're either on death's door or not."</p>

</div><div>Iain Macintyre   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>920 words</div><div>9 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Unseparated from birth until a month ago, Daniel and Henrik Sedin finally know what it's like to miss each other. Apparently, absence made their hearts grow fonder. Yeah, pass the Kleenex.</p>
<p>"Every night, he cried himself to sleep," Daniel Sedin said Sunday, reunited in practice with his twin after missing one month due to a broken foot. "We've played together so long. I knew he would do pretty good, but it would be different without me.</p>
<p>"There were a lot of games he knew he could play better, but the team was winning and that's all that matters."</p>
<p>A lot of Canucks should be weepy at the Sedin family reunion. It boosts the National Hockey League team by 11/2 players: all of Daniel and the half of Henrik that has been missing for many of the last 14 games.</p>
<p>As much as Vancouver needs back starting goalie Roberto Luongo, who missed practice Sunday due to the flu rather than his fractured rib, the Canucks have missed Daniel Sedin more.</p>
<p>The Canucks' leading goal-scorer the last three seasons, Sedin broke his foot on Oct. 7 when hit on the instep by teammate Alex Edler's slapshot. He flew to Dallas Saturday afternoon and looked fine in Sunday's practice.</p>
<p>If he practises well again today, Daniel will play with a protective plate on his left skate Tuesday in St. Louis, 34 days after the injury. It would end the longest separation of the twins since they began playing hockey as toddlers in Ornskoldsvik.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, by far," Henrik said. "I was hurt during the lockout [season in Sweden] for four weeks, but there was a national-team break, too, so I only missed five or six games.</p>
<p>"I don't think it was strange. I played with good players. But there are a couple of plays on the power play, 5-on-5, I know where he's going to be when I get the puck. [Without Daniel] I can't play on instinct. I have to look up and see where the other player is. That was the main difference."</p>
<p>The brothers talked daily during the injury. Almost daily.</p>
<p>"He told me I looked tired and needed to move my feet more," Henrik said. "So I got pissed off and didn't talk to him for two days.</p>
<p>"I got points, but I didn't play the way I wanted to a lot of times. The production was there, but my game wasn't where I wanted it to be."</p>
<p>Henrik had 13 points in 14 games without Daniel. But the points were clustered mostly in two three-game segments, and Henrik failed to make the scoresheet in half of the last 10 games.</p>
<p>As Daniel said, Henrik appeared to labour through some games, lacking quickness and any offensive threat at even strength.</p>
<p>Still, he leads the Canucks with eight goals and 19 points in 18 games and suddenly has a 13-point career lead on Daniel, 479-466, which should keep Henrik ahead for years given the brothers' even consistency.</p>
<p>"It's been tough being injured, but would have been much tougher if the team would have lost," Daniel said. "It felt so good skating [on my own] lately, I might as well skate with the team and see how it goes. We'll take it day by day. It's still early, so we don't want to take any chances. If everything feels good, it shouldn't be a problem."</p>
<p>Sedin skated in Vancouver Thursday, Friday and Saturday. He practised Sunday on a line with Henrik and Alex Burrows, who missed Daniel, too.</p>
<p>Burrows, who scored 28 times last season, has one goal in 13 games and it was into an empty-net. If anything, the extra power-play time Sedin's injury gave Burrows seemed to hurt the energetic winger's two-way game.</p>
<p>"I thought he looked fine today," coach Alain Vigneault said of Daniel. "We'll see how he does tomorrow. If he feels good, I think his brother and his coach will be very happy to have him back."</p>
<p>Others, too.</p>
<p>And Daniel isn't the only returning player who could give the lineup a boost.</p>
<p>Speedy checker Jannik Hansen, who mangled three fingers Sept. 27 in the Canucks' final pre-season game, said he's ready to play. And third-line winger Steve Bernier declared himself fit after missing two games with what the Canucks are calling seasonal flu.</p>
<p>"It was the just the flu everybody gets every year," Bernier said, aware of speculation about the H1N1 strain. "For 48 hours, it was awful. After that, I felt better but just didn't have any energy."</p>
<p>The return of Sedin, Bernier and Hansen would leave the Canucks with only four players out, one off their season low. But it would also require Vancouver to waive someone from the 23-man roster.</p>
<p>As Vigneault is inclined to keep two extra defenceman and only one spare forward, newly-signed winger Matt Pettinger is the most likely to go despite his solid play the last three games.</p>
<p>The Canucks, however, could keep Pettinger on the roster and Hansen on the long-term injured list another game or two until they better assess Sedin and Bernier.</p>

</p>
<p>It really hurts when he coughs.</p>
<p>Vancouver Canuck goalie Roberto Luongo's quick return from a broken rib was stalled Sunday by flu-like symptoms that prevented him from practising as planned.</p>
<p>Coach Alain Vigneault said Luongo's symptoms, which surfaced late Saturday, are similar to the flu that kept Canuck winger Steve Bernier out of two games last week. Bernier rejoined teammates at practice on Sunday and said he'll be ready to play Tuesday in St. Louis.</p>
<p>Bernier and the Canucks are emphasizing that his flu strain was not H1N1, but a common, seasonal variety.</p>
<p>Luongo fractured a rib Oct. 24 and came out of the Canuck lineup two games later. He was supposed to practise with the team Sunday and today and be available to start Tuesday in St. Louis.</p>
<p>It now seems likely Luongo won't play at least until Thursday's game in Detroit.</p>
<p>"He's a little under the weather," Vigneault said. "He started not feeling well yesterday, so he just stayed at the hotel today. We think it's a new form of virus that just attacks French guys. We'll see how he's doing tomorrow and if he's better, he might practise with us. If he's not doing well, then we'll fly him in later on to St. Louis."</p>
<p>Reminded that he is also a "French guy" like Bernier and Luongo, Vigneault laughed and said: "I've got to be careful."</p>
<p>As with Bernier, the Canucks have isolated Luongo at the team's hotel in order to reduce the risk of infecting other players. Bernier's main symptoms were chills and dizziness. He had neither the high fever nor cough typically associated with swine flu.</p>
<p>The Canucks' decision to put Bernier on a commercial flight between St. Paul and Dallas, rather than have him travel on the team charter after Thursday's 5-2 win in Minnesota, has rankled some people who argue the hockey team put its health interests above the public's.</p>
<p>But apart from the fact there are sick people carrying germs on every commercial flight -- and in every school classroom and community centre and anywhere else people gather -- Bernier said he needed a proper night's sleep in St. Paul and, by choice, wouldn't have gone near teammates.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to go on the plane and give something to the rest of the team," he said. "There was no question about me going with them."</p>
<p>Vigneault said travel plans for Luongo will be the same.</p>
<p>If he is sick today, he'll spend an extra night in Dallas, then fly Tuesday to St. Louis. The team charters out of Dallas this afternoon.</p>

<p>I am writing to correct the misinformation contained in the Calgary Herald guest editorial Nov. 7, "Federal Liberals responsible for shortage of flu vaccine."</p>
<p>The Harper Conservatives have had four years to put in place an effective pandemic plan. A closer look at the facts puts their failure to adequately prepare the supply and quick distribution of H1N1 flu vaccine into proper perspective.</p>
<p>Canada's Auditor General has found that the Conservative government has in fact failed to put a comprehensive plan for all emergency preparedness and response.</p>
<p>Jean Chretien's Liberal government built up Canada's domestic capacity to make it possible to produce sufficient pandemic influenza vaccine for all Canadians.</p>
<p>The 2001 pandemic vaccine contract with Shire Biologics (later acquired by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>) still allowed vaccines to be ordered from other manufacturers in case of a tight supply as this government has done by ordering 200,000 doses of non-adjuvanted vaccine from Australia.</p>
<p>The 2004 Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan clearly stated, multiple suppliers should be considered in the planning process.</p>
<p>This week the Parliament of Canada has called upon the government to use $400 million contingency set aside for pandemic response in the 2006 budget, to help the provinces and territories and municipalities speed up vaccine delivery by funding school based clinics to vaccinate children, fund additional clinics, and get the shots into the hands of family doctors for their high-risk patients.</p>
<p>The Harper Conservatives decided to order two different vaccines from one company with one plant and only one manufacturing line. The decision to order the second vaccine from the same company meant the company had to stop mass-producing adjuvanted vaccine is directly responsible for the shortages we've experienced this week. For the Conservatives to blame the previous government only heightens the national disgrace of their mishandling of this pandemic.</p>

</p>
<p>The toll of the H1N1 virus in Canada continued to grow Sunday, as health officials in Newfoundland and Labrador confirmed that province's third death linked to the virus.</p>
<p>The death of a 63-year-old woman from Labrador, who died Saturday night in hospital and who had "multiple underlying medical conditions," according to the local health authority, came as problems and controversy continued to haunt this country's massive vaccination effort.</p>
<p>In Montreal, the executive director of the Jewish General Hospital denied Saturday that 200 top financial donors were hand-picked to be vaccinated in the last two weeks, ahead of the rest of the population.</p>
<p>"It just isn't true," Hartley Stern said of a Montreal Gazette article that reported that "elite donors" were given priority for vaccination against H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Stern, however, acknowledged the existence of a list of 200 volunteers -- most of whom, if not all, are donors -- who were vaccinated ahead of other volunteers. In some cases, volunteers were not vaccinated at all.</p>
<p>Stern also confirmed that the Jewish General has already vaccinated at least 95 per cent of its staff, including such non-clinical workers as plumbers, janitors and the in-hospital printers. That would be in apparent violation of provincial guidelines that only health-care workers and staff who provide direct physical care to patients were to be inoculated immediately.</p>
<p>The controversy in Montreal followed the revelation that board members of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital were offered H1N1 flu shots. A statement from the hospital said the vaccinations were given during a clinic that was open to the public.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Windsor, Ont., area health unit was investigating after players and staff of an Ontario Hockey Association team were inoculated against the H1N1 virus.</p>

<p>Sheila Fraser has identified the vacuum in Canada's planning (or lack thereof) to handle emergencies such as the current H1N1 pandemic ("Still wanted: a plan for national emergencies," Nov. 6). This situation is not new and has been exacerbated because we haven't had many national emergencies recently. What is required when these situations arise is a focal point for the many actions possible at several levels of government - federal, provincial and municipal.</p>
<p>The essential qualification of such a co-ordinator is a thorough knowledge of the assets available to deal efficiently with any problem. Perhaps the job of equipping and co-ordinating the response system should be put up for public tender to the owners of large networks, such as <span class="companylink">Hydro-Québec</span> or <span class="companylink">Bell Canada</span>. After all, a budget of $58.5 million ought be able to buy more than excuses.</p>

<p>Re: Notes from the flu front. Nov. 4.</p>
<p>Dave Watson argues there is no moral conflict in hiring a '"entrepreneurial" person who will wait in line for you to receive bracelets for the H1N1 vaccination. I disagree.</p>
<p>Those most at risk of severe complications from the H1N1 virus include people with chronic medical conditions. That may prevent them from having the financial means to dish out the extra bucks to compete with those who can afford paying for someone to get the clinic bracelets. After all, isn't the point of having a public health-care system to allow everybody equal access to medical care, regardless of income?</p>
<p>Kudos to the public health officials for reacting accordingly to prevent this practice, which is essentially privatizing access to the precious vaccine and allowing a certain monopoly to those affluent people who can afford to exploit the system.</p>
<p>I got my vaccine Monday at the Vanier clinic. I was thoroughly delighted by the quality of service by all staff, who spent the day working hard to make sure everybody was informed of their wait times and that the clinic was running at maximum efficiency.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Small businesses on alert, not panicking over flu; Resources stretched thin as workers get sick, group says</b>
</div><div>Tom Spears   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>525 words</div><div>9 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>You run a small business. There are three employees, and flu puts two of them on the disabled list.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>It's not the kind of problem that finds its way into MBA case studies, but the Canadian Federation of Independent Business says its members are wary of what flu will do to their livelihoods.</p>
<p>No one's panicking, says Catherine Swift, president of the federation. But the more than 105,000 small and medium-sized firms in her organization are on alert. Most of Canada's workers, after all, are not in priority groups for flu shots.</p>
<p>"The problems are quite different" for a small business, she said.</p>
<p>"You could easily lose half or three-quarters of your workforce."</p>
<p>The current H1N1 pandemic isn't the first flu wave ever. It happens every year in one form or another, Swift notes.</p>
<p>"The owners themselves often end up working more," she says. They may bring in family members to help, small businesses often being family operations anyway.</p>
<p>But there's a glitch here: If flu has run through the household, it's harder to recruit family to help at work.</p>
<p>Plan B: "Working from home -- depending on the business, obviously. But the best advice is all the common-sense stuff that the health authorities are putting out."</p>
<p>Still, that's mostly advice about prevention, and some people will still get sick. In an odd way she feels the recession may help, making it easier to find workers in a hurry.</p>
<p>"If this had hit, say, a year and a half ago, it would have been much worse in that respect. At least labour markets are a little looser now."</p>
<p>Self-employed people such as cabbies or plumbers, she notes, are just out of luck if they get sick.</p>
<p>Small businesses can have trouble finding extra staff on short notice, said Greg Best.</p>
<p>He chairs the Glebe Business Improvement Area and is co-owner of several stores, including Sassy Bead Co., Bank Street Framing and Pom-Pom.</p>
<p>"It's hard to do (hire extra staff) because most of these things require some amount of training," he said.</p>
<p>"We do have part-time staff we draw on occasionally. Instead of three people (working), you might be down to two. The short answer is we just simply are stretched a bit thinner.</p>
<p>"We reduce some of our night-time hours, and you just work with what you have.</p>
<p>"We've been OK. We've lost the odd person," he said, adding that flu hasn't yet had a major impact.</p>
<p>The federation of independent business says its members generally haven't reported major illness among workers yet.</p>
<p>"The real scare, if we really do see massive illness, could be if consumers just say, 'I'm staying at home. I'm not going out to eat (or) shop.' That would kill the economy," Swift said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, she says, businesses should plan ahead for staff shortages, and "we'll just keep using our Purelle."</p>

<p>Paintball may seem like one of those activities that attracts guys in big pickup trucks with a penchant for camo and Rambo movies.

<p>An employee at Alberta Health Services makes one mistake by providing H1N1 vaccine to the Flames. That employee is sacked. If that employee based the decision on bad information from higher up, where should the buck stop?</p>

<p>Re: "Worst of flu still to come," Nov. 6.</p>
<p>The Lung Association, Alberta and Northwest Territories, supports Alberta's revised plan to focus on priority populations in the next wave of H1N1 vaccinations. We are, however, becoming increasingly concerned about the timing for vaccinations for people with chronic lung disease. One in five Canadians has lung disease, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. More than 13 per cent of Alberta children have asthma. COPD is the fourth leading cause of death nationwide and rising. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta data demonstrate that "the majority of people diagnosed with H1N1 do have underlying conditions." CDC data report that among hospitalized adults, 26 per cent had asthma before getting the flu and eight per cent had a chronic lung disease besides asthma. Also noted is that the most common underlying illnesses among children with H1N1 flu were asthma and chronic lung disease.</p>
<p>We appreciate that persons with chronic conditions have been identified under the longer-term plan. However, we are getting calls and e-mails from people with lung disease wondering when their turn will come. We have made one request to the responsible officials in the Alberta government: Will you please let us know what Alberta Health Services' plan is to vaccinate people with chronic lung diseases?</p>

</p>
<p>On Aug. 31, 1997, I was the producer of what was to be a new, edgy, open-line talk show just about to launch on one of the national news networks. For weeks, we planned topics, booked guests, wrote intros and planned witty 'surprises' that would make the show pop. The morning of our launch, the day of our debut, was the day Diana died.</p>
<p>People were sad, angry, full of blame. Our best-laid plans were cancelled, we opened the phone lines and let people talk, opine, tell their stories--it went on for weeks, no other conversation existed. As 'caller on line 1' wailed, causing everyone in the control room to snicker and have to throw to commercial, "there is no good left in the world." It was clearly a hysterical response.</p>
<p>While of course the story is different, this is nonetheless what I am reminded of as I watch the H1N1 coverage evolve. It has been a story with legs, projected in no small part by the media, which must accept some responsibility for the hoopla.</p>
<p>The "News" bombards you with worst-case scenarios, leading with every permutation and combination of the H1N1 story, real and hypothetical. Clever cut lines and animated graphics create doughnuts around alarming "SPECIAL REPORTS." 'Kid with hockey stick' photo is run front page, creating a mass Pavlovian response in parents: get thee to a lineup, fight wildebeest and wait time. In the guise of keeping you informed, the media highlights the five-hour wait, which, played enough times, becomes everyone's experience. The no-wait example is on the cutting room floor. Sound bites and quotes are taken from "streeters," not exactly informed sources, and played as if they represent the norm. Do that enough times, and soon enough they do. "The mood of the people," journalists call it. This is the mood of people from whom you wouldn't under normal circumstances take advice on pet-bathing.</p>
<p>In Alberta's case, add to this a government already on shaky legs, and you've practically got La Boheme. It's a good story.</p>
<p>We, as human beings, are responding, internalizing the hype as if it was fact. "Have you had your shot" has replaced "How 'bout the weather" as most ubiquitous opening line. I have a friend who answers her phone with a terse: "Don't even ask me if I've had my shot . . . Hello." Burly firefighters, policemen, even cab drivers are so moved by fear they lobby for a better place in line at the vaccine buffet like the shrimp is going to run out.</p>
<p>The H1N1 shot has become the cabbage patch doll of vaccines, with people who didn't even want one, now so frightened they're going to be without-- they're scrapping to grab-up a piece of "Nervous Nellie" before she's all gone. When I tune in now, I half expect to see live cameras following the vaccine in a white Bronco speeding down the highway as it's being delivered. It's become a ridiculous spectacle, with the panic completely overrunning the risk.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you in turn have a choice on how you respond to the news. Look beyond the coverage of the table thumping and calls for inquiries. Those are 'good viz' (visuals) as we say in the television biz, but not the most important story that's relevant to you right here and right now. We've buried the lead, again, as we say.</p>
<p>Separate the noise from the news. Tell the difference between views and the news. If you hate the government, plot your revenge for when it's meaningful, instead of obfuscating. In the meantime, get the message, not the medium. Don't lose the story. This is a bad virus, different from the rest. Get the shot when your time comes, sneeze into your sleeve, wash your hands, stay home when you're sick and watch for the signs that you need a doctor. That's the nub of it.</p>
<p>Take the rest of it with a grain of salt, not a spoonful of sugar.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A New Generation Remembers Sacrifices; Silence should be law: poll</b>
</div><div>Tiffany Crawford   </div>

</p>
<p>A majority of Canadians want observing two minutes of silence on Remembrance Day to be mandatory, suggests a new poll released to Canwest News Service.</p>
<p>Seven in 10 Canadians who responded to the survey agreed governments at all levels should enact a law to make everyone stop and observe two minutes of silence on Nov. 11, according to the Ipsos Reid poll.</p>
<p>The poll surveyed 1,032 people between Nov. 3 and 5, on behalf of the Historica-Dominion Institute.</p>
<p>A further 57 per cent of respondents said all public transit and cars, wherever possible, should stop for two minutes at 11 a.m. to honour fallen soldiers.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Log on for breaking news and our special section on the H1N1 flu outbreak</p>
<p>The support for mandatory silence may have more to do with Canadians' passion to keep a tradition alive than actually wanting it legally enshrined, said Marc Chalifoux, spokesman for the Historica-Dominion Institute.</p>
<p>"There is a growing awareness among Canadians about the importance of remembering those who have served and died under our flag and those who are currently serving in very dangerous places," he said.</p>
<p>The escalating number of Canadian soldiers who have died in Afghanistan may be a significant reason for the current desire to observe Remembrance Day, he said. Calgarian Sapper Steven Marshall's death in Afghanistan on Oct. 30 brought the total number of Canadian soldiers killed in Afghanistan to 133 since their mission began in 2002.</p>
<p>"I think the tragic loss of life in Afghanistan is part of it, but also there's an awareness that there are men and women out there who are choosing to serve their countryandmakingtheultimate sacrifice," Chalifoux said.</p>
<p>Legally enforcing a moment of remembrance didn't quite sit right with one organization that represents Canada's veterans.</p>
<p>"We don't need to legislate this," said Don Leonardo, 48, a spokesman for Veterans of Canada, who comes from a family of three generations of Canadians who fought in wars. Leonardo served as a peacekeeper in former Yugoslavia, while his grandfather and father served in both world wars.</p>
<p>"We need to remember our soldiers have fought for freedoms-- freedom of the press, freedom to enjoy the Olympics or the freedom to protest them, and the freedom to observe two minutes of silence."</p>
<p>Overall, 85 per cent of Canadians said they will observe the tradition. Quebec had the lowest response, with two thirds of Quebecers saying they will stop for two minutes to honour soldiers who have fought for Canada.</p>
<p>Fifty per cent of Quebecers believe that two minutes of silence should be made mandatory for individuals, schools and workplaces, compared to 71 per cent of Canadians overall who think so, the poll results suggested.</p>
<p>The survey has an estimated margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.</p>

</p>
<p>Today's top stories from Report on Business:</p>
<p>Kraft seen having to raise Cadbury bid</p>
<p>Analysts believe Kraft Foods Inc.will have to boost its $16.4-billion (U.S.) hostile bid for Cadbury PLC, which the British candy maker again rejected today. It's shaping up as an interesting fight. Kraft, whose brands include Oreo cookies and Nabisco crackers, had floated the takeover earlier but was required under British regulations to launch a formal bid by today or walk away for at least six months. The official offer unveiled today was similar to its first proposal, but actually lower because the share prices of the food companies have since changed. While investors see Kraft going higher, there appears to be no rush. Other potential bidders had their chance earlier and haven't yet come out of the wings despite much speculation that they would. Cadbury, the 195-year-old British company known for its Dairy Milk chocolate bar, dismissed the offer as not coming “remotely close to reflecting the true value of our company.” Read the story</p>

<p>Google acquires mobile ad company</p>
<p>Google Inc.is moving ever faster into the market for Internet-enabled cellphones, announcing a takeover key to monetizing mobile Wed traffic. Google is paying $750-million (U.S.) in stock for AdMob, a maker of technology for serving display advertisements on mobile phones and tracking their performance. Google is the world's top Internet search engine, and its Android software is increasingly used in smart phones. The deal unveiled today would allow the technology giant to serve advertisers better as they move further into the world of mobile. Said Google's vice-president of product management Susan Wojcicki: “Mobile advertising has enormous potential as a marketing medium, and while this industry is still in the early stages of development, AdMob has already made exceptional progress in a very short time.” Read the story</p>

<p>Dollar sinks, gold rises on rate outlook</p>
<p>What the G20 finance officials didn't say on the weekend played out in financial markets today as the U.S. dollar sank and gold poked through a fresh high. The Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers, meeting in Scotland, voiced little concern about the state of the greenback. That left investors with nothing to change the outlook for U.S. interest rates that are at historic lows, sending money instead into other currencies and other assets such as gold. Oil also rose, moving closer to $80 (U.S.) a barrel, after what is now-tropical storm Ida, downgraded from a hurricane, prompted a shut in of U.S. oil and gas production.</p>
<p>Mega Brands settles legal fight</p>
<p>Mega Brands said today it settled a bitter legal feud with the former owners of Rose Art Industries Inc., the New Jersey arts-and-crafts company it acquired four years ago. Under the deal, Mega Brands will receive $17.2-million in cash, while the former owners abandon any additional claims, estimated at $54.8-million. The purchase of Rose Art was supposed to be a major boost to Mega Brands after the 2005 acquisition, but turned into a marketing nightmare for the Montreal-based toy maker after reports of magnets coming loose from Rose Art's Magnetix toys. There were a series of recalls and an expensive redesign. While Mega Brands said today that the settlement validated its long-standing claim, the former owners said they agreed to drop their claim because Mega Brands' financial condition did not justify incurring further legal costs.

<p>Investing: Flu, strong dollar to eat into profits</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu, the strong dollar and higher fuel prices will eat into profits across a range of industries this year, the Conference Board of Canada predicts. The economy is recovering, and profits are expected to resume growing, but the recovery will be shaky in several sectors, the group said in a report compiled in collaboration with the Business Development Bank of Canada. “All industries are grappling with the effects of reduced demand and downward pressure on prices as a result of the recession,” said Michael Burt, the group's associate director responsible for industrial economic trends research. “On the upside, the recession has lowered input prices and limited wage growth, reducing costs pressures.” Second-by sector breakdown</p>

<p>Carney sees softer third quarter</p>
<p>Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney says recent indicators may suggest a softer third quarter than expected. But, he told reporters in Scotland at the G20 meeting on Saturday, there's nothing to indicate that slower-than-anticipated growth will derail the rebound, Bloomberg News reported today. The central bank chief was quoted as saying that recent data suggest “a somewhat softer third quarter, but again the profile of the recovery – with growth strengthening into the fourth quarter and into 2010 – I would say remains in place. We're at a turning point in the economic cycle, is our expectation, and the beginnings of the return to growth. The data is going to be choppy.” Mr. Carney has said Canada returned to growth, although the first two months of the third quarter show an economy that remains stalled.</p>
<p>Central bankers to pull back cautiously</p>
<p>The world's central bankers say they will begin pulling back emergency measures gradually, but they do see improvements in the economy. European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet, chair of talks on the economy at a Bank for International Settlements meeting in Basel, Switzerland, told reporters that “we see elements that are encouraging, the confirmation of the fact that we avoided the extreme depression, but we have elements that call for common vigilance. For central banks that relied on emergency moves, he said, “there is an element of gradual and timely phasing out of some of these measures.” Australia and Norway have already boosted interest rates, while other major central banks, including the Bank of Canada, have promised to keep rates low for some time.</p>
<p>Other signs today also point to an economy on the mend. Exports from Germany, a bellwether given that it is Europe's biggest economy and the world's largest exporter, rose more than expected in September. While still down sharply from a year ago, the month-to-month change is yet another signal of a rebound. Germany has already come out of recession. Germany's industrial output in September also increased more than expected, in part to meet the growing demand for its exports, another strong sign from the country that it looks to lead Europe out of its slump.</p>
<p>Housing market continues comeback</p>
<p>Economists believe the Canadian housing market will continue its comeback, particularly after another strong showing in construction today, though housing starts will take some time to return to pre-recession levels. Starts rose 5.4 per cent in October, increasing to 157,300 on an annualized basis from 149,300 in September, largely on the gains in condominium construction, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said today. Starts on single homes actually dipped, though they're still at their second highest level since the meltdown began in October, 2008. Some comments from economists:</p>
<p>“Although housing starts remain depressed, with activity below the 175,000 units necessary to keep pace with population growth and attrition, it is clear that the trajectory for the sector is towards recovery.” HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc. economist Stewart Hall</p>
<p>“While home-building activity still has a long recovery ahead and cannot reasonably be expected to revisit boom-type levels (at or above 200,000 units) over the next few years, the recovery seems well engaged.” TD economist Pascal Gauthier</p>
<p>“It adds to the growing list of indicators that have been pointing to a recovery ... though the rebound in residential construction has remain fairly modest.” TD Securities economics strategist Millan Mulraine</p>
<p>China marks ‘renewal' of relations with Africa</p>
<p>China is taking steps to fight suggestions that it is gobbling up Africa's resources. China's commerce minister, Chen Deming, is at a two-day summit, and said today that this year marks “the renewal of China-Africa relations.” China's ties to Africa have boosted trade to more than $100-billion (U.S.), but critics have said China is investing for its own benefit, with no assurances of sustainable benefits to African countries. Mr. Chen saidthat by pushing agriculture and infrastructure, China is helping Africa toward economic independence. Read the story</p>

<p>Bonuses heading for record</p>
<p>An analysis by Bloomberg News suggests the giants of Wall Street – Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s investment bank –are set to pay record bonuses this year. According to analysts' estimates, Bloomberg News says, they will pay almost $30-billion (U.S.) in bonuses, up from the previous record $26.8-billion two years ago. The payout would also mark a 60-per-cent hike from last year. Split among 119,000 people, it would average $250,400 each, the news agency said. The payouts come amid mounting controversy about bankers' pay in the wake of the financial crisis. Paul Hodgson, a senior research associate on compensation for Corporate Library in Portland, Maine, told Bloomberg: “all Street is beginning to resemble Clark Gable as Rhett Butler in the film Gone With the Wind: ‘Quite frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.'” In an interview with London's Sunday Times, Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein said the Wall Street giant has a social purpose in helping companies grow by raising capital, which in turn creates wealth.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Supply of flu vaccine is running tight; City's 10 priority-risk clinics operating smoothly, but will need delivery from province by Wednesday</b>
</div><div>Katie Daubs   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>521 words</div><div>9 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Although Toronto will have enough vaccine for its 10 priority group clinics on Monday and Tuesday, Toronto Public Health will need a delivery from the province to open clinics on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We will be waiting on a provincial announcement to let us know how much more we will get," spokeswoman Mary Margaret Crapper said Sunday.</p>
<p>"I'm optimistic the province will provide us with enough vaccine if they have it."</p>
<p>Despite the potential shortage, the lineup on Sunday at the Metro Hall clinic was like a relaxing Club Med compared to its opening day. People walked in right away, the sun streamed in the windows, and the hand sanitizer flowed like rum at an all-inclusive resort.</p>
<p>At times, it seemed like there were more nurses than people.</p>
<p>Shawn Wilcox came prepared with games, colouring books and crackers for his three children. He didn't need them.</p>
<p>"Our expectation was that we'd be here awhile," he said.</p>
<p>Ulla Wise, who has managed the clinic at Metro Hall since it opened, said Sunday's shots likely went faster because there were fewer people downtown on the weekend</p>
<p>Even with the low demand, the clinics would not vaccinate people not included in priority groups. Most of those turned away Sunday were over 65, travellers or older children who had come with a sibling under the age of 5.</p>
<p>Brian Jonkman doesn't see waiting for vaccines for his older children to be a problem. He and his wife went to the Etobicoke Civic Centre on Sunday with all three children, but only his 2-year-old was eligible.</p>
<p>The older children played tag while they waited for their little brother to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>"This really hasn't taken too long," Jonkman said.</p>
<p>But despite yesterday's comparatively smooth ride in Toronto, another problem surfaced in Ontario's bumpy rollout of the vaccine.</p>
<p>A Brampton man told The Canadian Press that a nurse gave his young daughter and almost a dozen other children a double dose of the H1N1 flu vaccine last week and that the nurse is still giving out shots.</p>
<p>Ted Heydrich said in an interview on Sunday he was told his daughter, Selena, 3, was one of 11 children given the higher dose by a nurse at the Indell Lane clinic last Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>A Peel Region Public Health supervisor didn't call him until Thursday to inform him of the error, he said.</p>
<p>Heydrich said the supervisor told him the nurse has been retrained in the proper procedure.</p>
<p>"I was absolutely shocked (that the nurse was still giving flu shots)," he said.</p>
<p>He said he thinks the nurse should lose her licence.</p>
<p>Since the vaccination campaign has begun, there have been vaccine shortages, long lineups at clinics and professional athletes jumping the queue for flu shots.</p>
<p>In Windsor, a local health unit has begun investigating why the LaSalle Vipers hockey team received the vaccine last Tuesday.</p>

<p>ANOTHER week of H1N1 flu vaccinations is taking place across the province this week -- earlier in some places and later in others.</p>
<p>In Hamiota and Killarney, flu clinics are being held today, while Winnipeg's H1N1 flu shot clinics are closed until after Remembrance Day.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Winnipeg's clinics are to reopen for high-risk groups from 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. and on Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Only those at highest risk of complications from H1N1 influenza will receive the H1N1 flu shot.</p>
<p>The high-risk groups include:</p>
<p>Children six months to under five years old;</p>
<p>Anyone of aboriginal ancestry;</p>
<p>Disadvantaged individuals (for example, the homeless);</p>
<p>People living in remote or isolated areas;</p>
<p>People under 65 with a chronic medical condition or other risks, including severe obesity, substance abuse or alcoholism;</p>
<p>Anyone with a weakened immune system or those who live with or care for them;</p>
<p>Those who live with or care for infants under six months old;</p>
<p>Single parents or anyone solely responsible for a dependent;</p>
<p>Health-care workers and medical first responders; and</p>
<p>Pregnant women (unadjuvanted vaccine is now available).</p>
<p>The WRHA says at-risk people with health conditions that make standing in line for long periods very difficult or impossible can call 940-3236 between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday to make other arrangements.</p>
<p>As of Nov. 4, Manitoba had received a total of 232,700 doses of vaccine. All vaccine has been sent to regional health authorities to administer through clinics and by appointment.</p>

<p>The Health Sciences Centre is hoping for a 'baby boom' this fall.</p>
<p>The province's largest hospital is in the midst of a volunteer drive and it's targeting retired baby boomers. Angie Boehm, the administrator of volunteer resources, said daytime volunteer shifts are among the hardest to fill. She's hopeful some new retirees and senior citizens who have time to spare will consider becoming HSC volunteers.</p>
<p>"Finding daytime volunteers is a challenge," said Boehm. "(Retirees and seniors) are at home. Sometimes they're sitting at home and looking at four walls and going 'Oh man I'm bored.'</p>
<p>"Well, I have something you can do that gives back and makes you feel great. There are lots of studies that show that volunteering is good for your health," Boehm said.</p>
<p>Just ask Max Hochman. The spry 87-year-old has been a volunteer at HSC for close to 14 years now. He said that after retiring, he spent a lot of his time sitting at home. After a few years of coaxing, a friend finally convinced Hochman to try volunteering at HSC.</p>
<p>"Eventually one day he caught me and said 'You're coming,' and I've never regretted it," said Hochman, a West Kildonan grandfather. "I've been so lucky to work with such nice people. I've enjoyed every minute."</p>
<p>Once each week, he volunteers his time in the facility's General Store, selling drinks, candy, magazines and lottery tickets.</p>
<p>Fellow General Store volunteer Evelyn Schmidt, a great-grandmother from Transcona who has volunteered at the hospital for the past seven years, said she takes great pride in working at the store, especially since the profits from sales go directly to supporting patient care.</p>
<p>"It's just wonderful -- it's made my life so full to come here those two mornings a week," explained Schmidt, who enjoys using her retail-management skills, which she acquired during a 33-year career with Canada <span class="companylink">Safeway</span>, to benefit the hospital.</p>
<p>But most of all, she said, it's the people she meets and those she works with that keep her coming back.</p>
<p>"It's just fun and everybody is so nice," said Schmidt, 73, who counts Hochman and Sharon Goretzky, another General Store volunteer, as some of her great friends.</p>
<p>Goretzky, a retired home-support worker, agrees with Schmidt's assessment.</p>
<p>"(Volunteering here) is like a social event -- it's not like work," said Goretzky, a 64-year-old grandmother who has volunteered at HSC for the past four years.</p>
<p>"It's like going out for coffee for four hours."</p>
<p>HSC requires volunteers to fill a variety of roles, mostly during daytime hours. In addition to needing help in the retail stores, the hospital also needs volunteers to assist in the restaurant as well to work with patients.</p>
<p>If you would like more information about volunteering at HSC, please phone 787-3533. Additional information can be found online at www.hsc.mb.ca[http://www.hsc.mb.ca].</p>

</p>
<p>KIEV -- With classes cancelled after the government declared a flu epidemic, Eric Barsadanyan and his friends spend their days hunched over cigarettes and soft drinks in the gloom of an empty coffee shop on the third floor of an equally empty shopping mall.</p>
<p>They had not heard of the H1N1 virus even a week ago. But they are pretty sure they understand it now.</p>
<p>“You catch it from imported food and clothing that isn't clean,” said Mr. Barsadanyan, an 18-year-old first-year medical student who wears his close-cropped hair shaved into stripes along the sides.</p>
<p>He is not worried because he heard that the Ministry of Health has taken a somewhat unusual step. “They sprayed the city,” he explained, “with the necessary products.”</p>
<p>Ukraine has been awash with such misinformation about H1N1 for the last week, since Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko set off a public panic by shutting schools, banning public gatherings and warning that whole cities might have to be quarantined to prevent the spread of the disease. They were the most draconian measures taken by any country since the flu first appeared in Mexico last spring.</p>
<p>But it is still far from clear whether Ukraine is in the grips of a runaway H1N1 epidemic, as some officials have suggested, or whether the precautions were a confused overreaction to a predictable winter outbreak of seasonal flu.</p>
<p>The numbers coming from different government agencies and state media have been wildly contradictory.</p>
<p>Depending on the source, the number of reported cases of flu and respiratory illness last month ranged from under 7,000 all the way up to half a million, with no indication of how many people normally fall ill or die from the flu in the winter in this country of 40 million people.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health has also issued conflicting information on the number of flu cases, flu-related deaths and suspected deaths due to the H1N1 virus. At one point, according to a state news agency report, a ministry official said flu deaths were down 10 per cent over last year.</p>
<p>An initial assessment from the World Health Organization – which sent a team of medical experts to Ukraine after a desperate plea for emergency aid from the country's President – was that the H1N1 virus could be confirmed as the cause of one of some 80 reported deaths from flu in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>The inconsistencies only increased public uncertainty about what was actually happening, and many Ukrainians appeared to have decided to prepare for the worst.</p>
<p>Across the country, people have emptied pharmacies of masks, gauze, vitamins and every variety of flu and cold medication. Rumours abound that helicopters have tried to disinfect Kiev by spraying it with chlorine gas. Government officials have gone on national television to deny other rumours that rural western Ukraine is in the grip of a deadly unnamed plague.</p>
<p>The flu epidemic was announced against the backdrop of a tightly fought presidential campaign pitting President Victor Yushchenko, the leader of Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution, against Ms. Tymoshenko. He was forced to cancel a planned campaign rally last week after the ban on public gatherings was announced.</p>
<p>A third candidate, the opposition leader Victor Yanukovych, has accused his rivals of trying to exploit public health fears to advance their flagging campaigns.</p>
<p>For many ordinary people, the political squabbling has added another element of doubt to the H1N1 scare.</p>
<p>“There is always some kind of fever – economic, health-wise or political – before an election. It's a nice way for politicians to show they are doing something,” said Larysa Kostrikina, a graphic artist. “I think this one will be over when the election is over” in January.</p>
<p>Not even gauze was available in the city by midweek. But that did not stop people from stopping in at every pharmacy in hopes of finding a talisman against a virus that many referred to as the “lung plague.”</p>
<p>Anything, it seemed, would do for the crowd gathered around the window of a tiny drug store outside the entrance to the Pozdnyaki subway station in Kiev one evening last week.</p>
<p>“I'm not sick. I just want to strengthen my immune system,” said one middle-aged woman wrapped in a heavy overcoat and a fraying homemade mask. She was looking for a Russian-made cream that was particularly sought-after in Kiev because it is supposed to kill viruses when spread inside the nostrils.</p>
<p>In Canada and many Western countries, the H1N1 virus has been in the news for months and a public debate has been raging for weeks over how to handle the vaccine. That debate has passed many other countries by, however.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, until the government abruptly declared an epidemic last week, the new virus was the subject of only sketchy references in the media.</p>
<p>“People naturally are panicked because they don't know about this and haven't been prepared for it,” said Michail Radutsky, president of the private Boris Clinic, one of the biggest private clinics in the country.</p>
<p>Its doctors have seen four times the usual number of patients in the past week, he said. Some have flu-like symptoms. Most, however, are just frightened.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>H1N1: WHAT THE WORLD IS DOING</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus is widespread, with most illness seen in younger people. More than half of those admitted to hospitals are under 25 years old. The United States has four vaccine suppliers, but has been slow in receiving vaccine. And there has been controversy: Americans learned that employees of financial giants <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> got the vaccine even as many community clinics had none.</p>
<p>Mexico</p>
<p>Mexico was the epicentre of the first outbreak about seven months ago. But when manufacturers moved to develop a vaccine, most of the vaccine was snapped up by wealthy countries, including the United States and Canada. Vaccine supplies are low, and officials plan to provide it to high-risk groups, including pregnant women, health-care workers and young children.</p>
<p>Britain</p>
<p>There are no pictures of long lineups, and no cries of injustice that the vaccine is going to the wealthy. Vaccine is given out mostly by invitation only to those at high-risk for complications. Britain's National Health Service sent letters inviting those who qualify to make an appointment and get their shots first.</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>H1N1 is on the rise in China, triggering an early start to the winter influenza season. The country is among more than 20 to have launched mass immunization campaigns against the virus. China has moved quickly to vaccinate the most vulnerable groups after being accused of failing to move swiftly enough to stop the 2003 outbreak of SARS.</p>

<p>11In fact, it is almost in crisis itself -- an identity crisis, that is.</p>
<p>Auditor general Sheila Fraser, who reported to Parliament on her latest audits Tuesday, found that after six years since it was formed, the federal department has not carved out the leadership role it was to assume among federal departments and the provinces. That hobbles its ability to co-ordinate disaster planning, response and recovery in the country. In other words, even after dedicating hundreds of millions of dollars to improve national security in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Canada is not much better able to mount a co-ordinated national response than it was prior to the event.</p>
<p>Canada has had a series of emergencies since 2001, but each had limited effect. A true national disaster, such as a cyber-attack that brings the country's political and economic systems to its knees, sounds fantastic, but it is not impossible. Just ask the people of Estonia who in spring of 2007 were gripped in Internet paralysis when the websites of its banks, parliament, government departments and media were attacked and rendered almost inoperable. Indeed, Ms. Fraser notes that attacks against computer systems in Canada, including federal systems, are increasing.</p>
<p>Canadians don't need to do much imagining to understand the blowback that a lack of federal co-ordination of emergency management can create. The H1N1 pandemic has not had significant effect because it is a relatively mild virus, killing relatively few people. But where mistakes have been made, they've been readily felt and illustrate the potential for havoc.</p>
<p>Native communities in northern Manitoba suffered from H1N1 hardest last spring and were left wondering for months when they would get simple protective supplies -- hand sanitizers with or without alcohol, masks and anti-virals. Amid the confusion that erupts when responsibility crosses departments (federal health and Indian and Northern Affairs), Manitoba acted on its own. Further, Canada's chief public health officer, David Butler-Jones, has bemoaned the fact the country relied on a single vaccine producer who had one dedicated production line for H1N1 vaccine. Dr. Butler-Jones told the Globe and Mail that he wishes all provinces had heeded his advice to prioritize high-risk groups for vaccination.</p>
<p>These issues could have had Canada floundering if H1N1 were a real killer. The idea of the public safety department is that a set of eyes watching over disaster planning would predict and prevent such missteps.</p>
<p>The H1N1 pandemic is giving Canadians a snapshot of how the country responds to an emerging threat. An ineffective disaster manager is a liability as it allows all other actors to assume someone is in charge of managing a response. Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan must fulfill the leadership role, or the Harper government should abandon the concept and press federal departments to learn to work together.</p>

<p>With H1N1 hitting offices, more people are being forced - or choosing - to telecommute.</p>
<p>1. Separate your work space</p>
<p>from your living space</p>
<p>Unless your corporate office places you a few metres from a fridge and a TV beaming soap operas to your desk all afternoon, you should find a space in your home far away from living and entertainment zones.</p>
<p>Victoria career coach Michele Waters says a spare bedroom is ideal – it'll block out most distractions and give you a private space.</p>
<p>But if home is a 400-square-foot bachelor apartment, Ms. Waters says, you can mentally adjust to starting your work day by performing a morning ritual before going to “the office.”</p>
<p>“Walk around the block if that's appropriate. Do some form of exercise. Do something that associates with, ‘Now I'm transitioning to my work.' ”</p>
<p>2. Dress the part</p>
<p>When James Kendrick, the Dallas-based blogger behind tech site jkOnTheRun.com, started working from home in 2003, he dressed for comfort: a ratty T-shirt and a pair of ripped jeans.</p>
<p>“What I found early on was that it was very easy to kind of evolve into an unprofessional work ethic,” he says.</p>
<p>Now, he dons a polo or button-down shirt with some Dockers every morning – not just to get him in the right mind frame, but to look professional in video conferences.</p>
<p>He can always tell if the people he's speaking to on Skype are still in their pyjamas: “The first thing they'll say is ‘audio only' and so you know immediately when they tell you that.”</p>
<p>3. Create an ergonomic work environment</p>
<p>Clare Kumar, a Toronto-based professional organizer, came down with the flu last month and gave in to the temptation of cozying up in bed with her laptop. While it was fine for short bursts of typing, she says that when working from home, it's important to choose an office chair over a pillow-top mattress. Eight hours in bed or on the couch can cause serious lower back pain and shoulder tension, she warns.</p>
<p>“If you're hunched over to look at a laptop rather than have something at eye level, your body will know something's not quite right,” she says.</p>
<p>4. Keep regular work hours</p>
<p>When Mr. Kendrick began working from home, he kept the same start time: 7 a.m. He knew sleeping in till noon would have hit his output.</p>
<p>If you find yourself taking two-hour coffee breaks, Ms. Waters recommends setting a timer so you don't overindulge. And if you're a workaholic, set it to remind yourself to take a break.</p>
<p>“Even if they never take a break in the corporate office, it's important they do in the home office,” she says. “They lose energy – there's no outside stimulation.”</p>
<p>5. Keep the social networking to a minimum</p>
<p>Jeff Zbar, a telework columnist in Coral Springs, Fla., found that without any supervision at his home office, he could spend countless hours obsessively updating his Twitter and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> accounts.</p>
<p>A few months ago, he created a “self-imposed embargo” on social networking sites. Now he doesn't open them in the morning, which has killed the temptation to constantly check the sites throughout the day.</p>
<p>If you're using a company-issued computer, have co-workers as friends on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or have an open Twitter account, Mr. Zbar's example is a good one to follow: It's all too easy for your boss to track your social networking “breaks” remotely, he says.</p>
<p>*And don't do this: Pretend you're at the corporate office when speaking with clients. They'll clue in that you're at home when the door bell rings or your toddler squeals.”</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>Read</p>
<p>After much coaxing, your boss has agreed to let you work from home in a major show of trust. How foolish of him.</p>
<p>With the White Collar Slacker's Handbook, author Marc Saltzman unveils tech tricks to not only give your boss the illusion that you're productive, but probably win you the title of Employee of the Month and the accompanying Red Lobster gift certificate.</p>
<p>If you want to clock out early, you can configure <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> Outlook to release an e-mail at twilight to win you points as the diligent employee who works at all hours, Mr. Saltzman suggests.</p>
<p>He also recommends setting up call-forwarding. If your supervisor rings your home phone and you're out getting groceries, you can answer on your cell. You'll just have to figure out how to explain, “Clean-up in aisle five” blaring over the loudspeakers.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>How it looks</p>
<p>Chief information officers were asked: "Do you agree or disagree with the following statements about telecommuting, as they apply to your company?"</p>
<p>The quality of work suffers because of less face-to-face contact with colleagues.</p>
<p>Disagree: 52%</p>
<p>Donít know: 10%</p>
<p>Agree: 38%</p>
<p>Telecommuting employees have little oversight, which makes them less productive.</p>
<p>Disagree: 68%</p>
<p>Donít know: 11%</p>
<p>Agree: 21%</p>
<p>Telecommuting employees generate too many security concerns.</p>
<p>Disagree: 64%</p>
<p>Donít know: 9%</p>
<p>Agree: 27%</p>

<p>More money is urgently needed to study people made dangerously ill by the H1N1 flu -- even if they account for only a small fraction of pandemic patients, say critical-care physicians who complain their key field has been chronically starved of research funds.</p>
<p>The doctors who preside over intensive-care units (ICUs) and fight to save the sickest of influenza sufferers say they managed to cobble together a partial network of Canadian hospitals earlier this summer to track the characteristics of severe flu patients. The resulting study, published in a major American journal last month, was viewed around the world as ground-breaking, but it was done without any federal funding, they say.</p>
<p>Intensive-care medicine has generally attracted relatively little research grant money, despite the fact it accounts for a huge proportion of health care spending -- estimated by some at 1% of Canada's gross domestic product, the ICU doctors say.</p>
<p>"The intensive care unit is often kind of the harbinger for any kind of severe illness in the community, because the sickest patients end up being cared for in the ICU," said Dr. John Marshall, head of the Canadian critical care trials group. "We are in a sense the canary in the coal mine."</p>
<p>Stepped-up study efforts might help solve the disturbing mystery of why a small number of relatively healthy young people are made so ill by H1N1 -- probably a matter of genetics --and uncover new ways to treat them, he said.</p>
<p>The Canadian Institute for Health Research and the Public Health Agency of Canada recently offered critical-care medicine some funding for H1N1 study. Dr. David Butler-Jones, head of the agency, said in an interview this week that additional research in the area is important.</p>
<p>Millions more is needed, though, to set up a system involving all ICUs in the country to record and share basic information on each of their patients, said Dr. Rob Fowler, critical-care physician at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.</p>
<p>The Ontario government funded such a project earlier this year and it is proving invaluable, he said.</p>
<p>"If you're in the business of preventing people from dying from H1N1, then you are the people you need to focus on," said Dr. Fowler.</p>
<p>The intensivists' pleas underline, though, what some see as a subtle tension in pandemic-flu medicine between the infectious-disease specialists who encounter a wide range of patients and often focus on prevention, and critical-care doctors who treat only the most ill.</p>
<p>The infection experts have been more apt to remind Canadians that the vast majority of pandemic-flu patients endure only mild illness; the critical-care doctors have spoken out about the desperately ill minority.</p>
<p>"Never was there a group that so longed to make themselves seem more important than everyone else than critical care medicine," quipped one communicable disease specialist earlier this month. "For them, all the world is a tragedy. But you have to be careful when you talk to the general public not to scare them."</p>
<p>Like other infectious-disease (ID) specialists interviewed, Dr. Lynora Saxinger of the University of Alberta said both perspectives are important, but cautioned against focusing too much on ICU patients.</p>
<p>"Critical care has been to a certain extent driving the influenza agenda ... but I think that can bias the discussion a little bit too much," she said. "At the end of the day, most people who get this flu will be miserable, will be sick, will get better. Some balance is needed between the two."</p>
<p>Dr. Marshall noted that infectious-disease physicians focus on attacking the virus itself. His specialty targets the way that specific patients respond to the virus, an approach that has traditionally been given much less emphasis, he said.</p>
<p>The key to grasping why H1N1 affects some healthy people so acutely probably lies with polymorphisms, subtle gene variations that can translate into "quite dramatic" differences in how someone responds to an infection, said Dr. Marshall.</p>
<p>"When you see these patients, it's clear there has to be unidentified genetic cross factors for severe disease, " he said. "And we have no way of knowing who might be at greater risk."</p>
<p>The trials group is also pushing for funding to study how best to treat H1N1 patients. That includes issues such as the use of corticosteroids, a potent anti-inflammatory that helps some people with acute lung injury, but may suppress the immune response of flu sufferers, he said.</p>
<p>The doctors also want to investigate the unusual idea of treating H1N1 with statins -- the cholesterol-lowering drug, said Dr. Marshall. A recent U.S. study found that patients who were already taking statins were half as likely to die when they got seasonal flu</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Too much'awareness' is bad for our health</b>

<p>'Cancer begs for year-round awareness," reads the headline of a letter to the editor in Georgia's Augusta Chronicle this week. The letter writer then wades into a debate about whether Breast Cancer Awareness Month (which is October) should be expanded to include all types of cancer. She thinks it shouldn't because it would become too broad, but suggests the media should essentially make the public aware of all cancers every month. Such a nice idea, yet ...</p>
<p>Bombarded by information, we tend to pay less and less heed the more we hear about a good cause -- and the more good causes we hear about. Sure, October was Breast Cancer Awareness Month. But it was also Domestic Violence Month. And Autism Awareness Month. And Brain Tumour Awareness Month, Islamic History Month, Community Support Month, Car Safety Month, Innovation in Eye Care Month, Learning Disabilities Awareness Month, Child Abuse Awareness Month, Lupus Awareness Month and Healthy Workplace Month.</p>
<p>I'd go on (because believe me, there are more), but I'd just end up blowing my word count. Besides, you get the picture.</p>
<p>There's only so much a person can be aware of at one time, and too much "awareness-raising" just leads to the public tuning out. And who can blame them? They'd go crazy if they didn't (a topic perhaps best left for a column during National Mental Health Week at the beginning of May).</p>
<p>The reason I bring all this up: It helps explain, at least in part, why the recent H1N1 vaccination efforts have been such a flop.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. I'm not one of those amateur-hour Liberal spin doctors who believe H1N1 will be "the Harper government's Hurricane Katrina." For better (for us) or worse (for the people of New Orleans), Katrina was far</p>
<p>more destructive and dangerous than H1N1 will ever be.</p>
<p>But it does make sense to try to vaccinate the population against an infectious disease, and the current efforts to do so, in Ontario in particular, haven't been going especially smoothly.</p>
<p>At first, it seemed the majority of the public had no intention of getting vaccinated -- partly because of paranoid conspiracy theories and fears about side effects, but also partly because government "awareness-raising" about health is so frequent (unrelenting, even) that we've long since tuned it out.</p>
<p>"Trick-or-treaters should wear sturdy walking shoes," Health Canada advised the</p>
<p>public at Halloween. "Eat well. Be active. Have fun," they suggest, in response to the challenge of how to prevent Type 2 Diabetes. There's even a spot on their website that helps you "choos[e] a personal insect repellant."</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that by the time the serious matter of getting vaccinated came up people had stopped listening? The advice and warnings had already faded to familiar, completely unremarkable background noise.</p>
<p>Then in Ontario, a healthy teenager died suddenly, allegedly from H1N1. That was dramatic enough to break through the static and catch people's ears. Similar events occurred in the rest of the country, and suddenly people did want to get vaccinated. Now.</p>
<p>The government was unprepared for the demand (by golly, there was never this kind of a run on sturdy orange and black footwear in October!) and ... well, just check out the latest headlines about the confusion and chaos surrounding the efforts, particularly in Alberta and Ontario, to get high-risk groups vaccinated in a timely and organized way. Thank goodness this is H1N1 and not Polio.</p>
<p>Well, the trouble is that one day it might be, not Polio, but something equally serious, or at least more serious than H1N1.</p>
<p>It's going to be very difficult to convey the urgency of that information to a population that is constantly being told to pay attention -- to nutrition, to air quality, to drinking water, to breastfeeding, to product recalls, to "negative lifestyle practices," etc. Simply put, the only way for the government or well-meaning interest groups to maintain an authoritative and audible voice in our lives is to stop talking at us so much.</p>
<p>In an age of information, it's also true that staying silent can leave an opening for the kooks, the conspiracy theorists and, as Colby Cosh calls them, the "weird-ists," to take over the debate. But those who want to be able to wield influence when it counts have to pick their battles.</p>
<p>Maybe we should let all those crazy theories about Halloween being more fun in five-inch heels go without comment.</p>
<p>Then when it comes time to issue crucial instructions in a public health emergency, those instructions will carry that much more gravitas. Or at least they'll have more impact than National Soil Conservation Week.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>School absentee rate blamed on H1N1 scare; 10% In Gta Schools; Pattern expected to appear in city next</b>

</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus appears to be scaring students out of class, as GTA school districts reported student absenteeism above 10% in dozens of schools last week.</p>
<p>"At 10%, you realize there is something different going on," said Mark Joel, superintendent of education at the Durham District School Board, where 54 of its 130 schools reported 10% or more of their students calling in sick.</p>
<p>"These numbers, while they may be the same and normal at one school, are widespread," he said, adding Durham's peak for students avoiding classes was between Tuesday and Thursday last week. He watched the pattern of absenteeism start in Oshawa before it moved into Whitby, Ajax and the north of Durham. He suspects absenteeism will move to Pickering and into Toronto next.</p>
<p>Public health officials in each region asked schools to track student absenteeism if the percentage was above 10%.</p>
<p>"Some of it has to do with the tragic death of [Evan Frustaglio]. It really created a lot of fear and parents just decided to keep their children at home," said Corrado Maltese, safety manager for the Toronto Catholic District School Board.</p>
<p>Toronto District School Board spokeswoman May Moore agreed. "Parents became very concerned and wanted as much information as possible," she said.</p>
<p>Evan, a healthy 13-year-old boy, died after contracting H1N1 flu last week, creating fear among parents. Suddenly, parents and their children were in three-hour lineups at vaccine clinics.</p>
<p>"Parents became more realistic to the fact that the flu is here and they're dealing with it," Mr. Joel said.</p>
<p>Only 74 of 550 Toronto schools had 10% or more of their students absent by last Friday, still, an increase compared with previous weeks.</p>
<p>TDSB called the relatively low 13% "uncharacteristically high" while Toronto's Catholic district reported an "absolutely abnormal" 10 of 201 schools with absenteeism anomalies.</p>
<p>Ms. Moore noted that the TDSB is significantly larger than other school boards, so the extreme differences between Toronto and other regions is "a little misleading."</p>
<p>"We're feeling the effects just like other districts," Ms. Moore said.</p>
<p>The Peel District School Board saw 41 of its 200 elementary schools with a 10% or more absentee rate, a decline from 53 schools recorded days ago.</p>
<p>In York, 41 of 193 schools hit above the mark on Nov. 3, the most recent data collected for the week.</p>
<p>The district recorded daily absenteeism for the past two years, but figures from last year's flu season won't be compared with this year, Lucia Cascioli, YRDS spokeswoman, said.</p>
<p>"We're not comparing apples to apples here. This is not a regular flu season," she said.</p>

<p>BUSCH CATCHES BREAK</p>
<p>Jimmie Johnson's drive to history took a hard hit against the wall and Kyle Busch ran out of gas trying to complete an unprecedented NASCAR trifecta. Kurt Busch won at Texas Motor Speedway Sunday, taking over the lead with 21/2 laps left when his younger brother's car suddenly slowed down on the backstretch after leading 232 laps. Johnson, the series points leader trying to become the first Sprint Cup driver to win four consecutive season championships, wrecked on the third lap. Johnson returned to finish 38th and his points lead with two races left was cut from 184 to 73 ahead of Hendrick teammate Mark Martin, who finished fourth.</p>
<p>CHELSEA WIDENS LEAD</p>
<p>Chelsea won Sunday's Premier League showdown against champions Manchester United 1-0 after a 76th-minute John Terry header broke a scoreless tie. Chelsea now has 30 points, five ahead of United and Arsenal, which won 4-1 at Wolverhampton Wanderers Saturday.</p>
<p>MURRAY CRUISES</p>
<p>British top seed Andy Murray defeated Russia's Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 6-2 Sunday to win the Valencia ATP title and capture his sixth trophy of the season in Valencia, Spain. The world No. 4 took just 69 minutes to beat the unseeded Russian and wrap up the 14th title of his career.</p>
<p>DJOKOVIC CLAIMS CROWN</p>
<p>Novak Djokovic overcame Roger Federer on the world No. 1's home ground Sunday, carving out a 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 final win at the Swiss Indoors in Basel, Switzerland.</p>
<p>MICKELSON PREVAILS</p>
<p>Phil Mickelson held off a resurgent Ernie Els in a tense finale to win both the WGC-<span class="companylink">HSBC</span> Champions Sunday in Shanghai and a personal battle with fellow American Tiger Woods, who faded to finish sixth. The world No. 2 showed nerves of steel to claim the US$1.2-million prize by a stroke from the South African after shooting 69 for a 17-under-par total of 271.</p>
<p>SONG TOPS CHARTS</p>
<p>South Korea's Bo Bae Song won the Miz-uno Classic in Shima, Japan, Sunday for her first LPGA Tour title, closing with a four-under 68 for a three-stroke victory over top-ranked Lorena Ochoa, Brittany Lang and Hee Young Park.</p>
<p>CRONE, POIRIER WIN BRONZE</p>
<p>Vanessa Crone of Aurora, Ont., and Paul Poirier of Unionville, Ont., won the bronze medal in ice dancing Sunday at the NHK Trophy ISU Grand Prix figure skating competition in Nagano, Japan. Americans Meryl Davis and Charlie White took the gold with 201.97 points.</p>
<p>CURLERS STICK TO TRADITION</p>
<p>It's the only sport in which the players shake hands before and after the game. And the H1N1 outbreak won't change that tradition at the Canadian Olympic Trials curling pre-qualifier, which kicks off Tuesday at the CN Centre in Prince George, B.C. "I don't think anybody would be offended if you shake somebody's hand then walk over to get the (hand sanitizer), wipe your hands down and away you go," said Winnipeg's Jeff Stoughton.</p>
<p>WOLVERINES BLOW LEAD</p>
<p>Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez was handed a victory cigar after each of his four wins in September. Since then, his season has gone up in smoke. The Boilermakers rallied from a two-touchdown deficit to beat the Wolverines 38-36 Saturday to keep their bowl hopes alive while hurting Michigan's chances.</p>
<p>SPARTANS SOAR</p>
<p>Ashton Leggett ran for 110 yards and four touchdowns and Kirk Cousins threw for two scores to lead Michigan State past Western Michigan 49-14 Saturday in East Lansing, Mich.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Henrik's crying time is almost over; Daniel Sedin on verge of rejoining lineup; Luongo bed-ridden with flu</b>
</div><div>Ben Kuzma   </div>
<div>The Province</div>
<div>695 words</div><div>9 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A33</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>DALLAS -- The best barometer for true health of the Vancouver Canucks wasn't a comment from the coach or offerings from the afflicted Sunday. It was a 20-minute bag skate.</p>
<p>Daniel Sedin arrived here in time to test his fractured left foot and survived the torture. Flu-ridden Steve Bernier got out of bed after three days of isolation to do the same, while Roberto Luongo stayed in bed as the latest to experience flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>It could mean Daniel and Henrik will be reunited to face the Blues in St. Louis on Tuesday. It could mean the same for Bernier. And it could mean Luongo, who had been taking practice shots in recovering from a hairline rib fracture, may not play until Thursday in Detroit. Or later.</p>
<p>"He's a little under the weather and stayed back at the hotel," said Canucks coach Alain Vigneault, who refuted speculation that the starter may have suffered a setback. "He started not feeling well [Saturday] and we'll see how he's doing [today]. If he's not better, we'll fly him later into St. Louis."</p>
<p>Luongo absorbed a Niklas Hagman shot in the third period against Toronto on Oct. 24 and had targeted a Tuesday return, but will be replaced by Andrew Raycroft if he can't go.</p>
<p>And if Luongo's illness intensifies, he'll be kept from the club as a precaution in the same manner Bernier was. The Canucks plan to receive H1N1 flu vaccine shots when their five-game road trip ends next Saturday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, after breaking his foot Oct. 7 on a shot from teammate Alex Edler, Daniel didn't look like a guy who had been hobbling around in a cast. He did line drills Sunday. He did extra skating.</p>
<p>"It felt good," said the winger, who had skated on his own the last three days before flying into Dallas on Saturday night. "I'm a little rusty because I've been in a cast for four weeks, so the left foot is unstable. But I might as well skate with the team and see how it goes.</p>
<p>"I'm going to take it day by day. It's still early and we don't want to take any chances, but if everything feels good then it shouldn't be a problem. The foot is pretty safe, but if I take another shot there [instep], there's a chance I could break it again."</p>
<p>Aside from adding extra protection to the skate boot, Daniel expects to pick up where he left off with his brother. The pair combined for 10 points in the first four games before Daniel was hurt and while Henrik obviously missed his brother, he still managed 12 points (5-7) in 14 games without his regular winger.</p>
<p>"It's going to take a while for him to get back into game shape," said Henrik. "He hasn't practised with the team and in a game there's less time out there."</p>
<p>"I thought Danny looked fine," added Vigneault. "If he feels good, his brother and his coach will be very happy to have him back."</p>
<p>Daniel must be feeling better because he took a playful poke at his brother when asked how often Henrik called while he was sidelined?</p>
<p>"Every night," chuckled Daniel. "He cried himself to sleep."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bernier was soaked in post-flu sweat Sunday, but believes he can play Tuesday.</p>
<p>"I probably lost four pounds and you can feel a little weak," Bernier said. "But I'll be ready to go."</p>
<p>Jannik Hansen also practised for the first time since having pins removed last week from three broken fingers on his right hand. The winger was hurt in a preseason scrap with Gilbert Brule.</p>
<p>"The hand is fine now, but it's getting my feet back under me," said Hansen.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccine misinformation highly contagious</b>
</div><div>Catherine D'Amico   </div>
<div>Special to The Windsor Star</div>
<div>919 words</div><div>9 November 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>I am a family physician and I am going to get my H1N1 flu shot and so are my children. I hope that my fellow Canadians will too.</p>
<p>Based on what occurred in the Southern Hemisphere during their winter this year, it is expected that about 80 per cent or more of the influenza virus circulating this year will be H1N1 and about 20 per cent seasonal flu.</p>
<p>There is a lot of misinformation being passed from person to person about the flu vaccine. And, unfortunately, many are simply accepting what they hear as fact.</p>
<p>Why do people who would never use <span class="companylink">Google</span> or the opinions of friends and colleagues to decide that they knew more than their lawyer, engineer or architect, decide that they know better than their physicians? Or the PhDs in immunology and microbiology and public health staff who research these issues for months or years and have the scientific background to be able to truly evaluate the research and safety data?</p>
<p>How could all the scientists and physicians and governments in every province, state and country in the world who are all looking at the data and recommending vaccination be wrong?</p>
<p>Here are the facts: The seasonal flu vaccine and H1N1 vaccine are called subunit vaccines which do not introduce live or whole flu virus into the body. The flu vaccine delivers a minute quantity of a sterilized, purified portion of the influenza virus into the body. The immune system is then stimulated to respond and, in about two weeks, this results in immunity.</p>
<p>When someone gets the actual flu, they have had whole, live, influenza virus enter their body through their nose and mouth. The influenza virus attaches to the nasopharynx cells, then enters and reproduces within them. Millions and millions of live viruses are then released, teaming throughout the person's body and bloodstream. This is an overwhelming attack and, as the battle ensues and the immune system fights, the temperature rises, the body fatigues and the symptoms of influenza result. Most cases of H1N1 have been mild but, as we have seen, for some -- and sometimes randomly -- the battle is severe and death results.</p>
<p>Why would you choose for yourself, or much more importantly for your child, to come into contact with the live virus and submit to millions and millions of live, replicating viruses circulating for days and days? Does it not make more sense to, instead, get a vaccine that injects a sterilized and killed tiny portion of that same virus? I have chosen this option for my children and for myself (including during my pregnancies) for over a decade and have no regrets.</p>
<p>The problem with subunit vaccines is that since they contain only a part of the virus, they often cannot stimulate a complete immune response, especially in those with weak immune systems such as young children, the elderly, or those with chronic diseases. For that reason, scientists add adjuvants to vaccines. Adjuvants are immune-system stimulators that enhance the response to the vaccine. (The October 2009 issue of Scientific American has a thorough article on vaccines and adjuvants.) The H1N1 vaccine contains an oil-in-water adjuvant called squalene. Squalene is a naturally occurring sterilized oil. Oil-in-water adjuvants have been studied and approved as safe and are used in various European vaccines, including their flu shots.</p>
<p>Something that really puzzles me is how quickly people will put into their own and their children's bodies anything labelled as an immune stimulant if it is sold in a natural products store. These products do not have long-term safety data, are much less rigorously tested for safety than vaccines and adjuvants, and claims are often supported by very poor quality studies that were done by the very companies selling the product.</p>
<p>There is a question I am frequently asked: If the nurses, paramedics and hospital workers are not getting vaccinated, doesn't that suggest that I should be concerned about getting vaccinated?</p>
<p>It is interesting that the rate of vaccination among health care workers is similar to the rate in the general population. The reason for this seems to be that health care workers obtain their information about the vaccine and influenza in exactly the same way as the general public. They <span class="companylink">Google</span>, read newspapers and talk among themselves. There are no requirements for health care workers to participate in any accredited educational programs related to vaccines or influenza.</p>
<p>To protect those at high risk from influenza, in whom the vaccine does not protect well due to their weak immune response, it is important that their caregivers be vaccinated so that they do not infect them. It is particularly concerning that health care workers could infect or kill our most vulnerable by choosing not to be vaccinated. Research indicates that H1N1 is infectious one day before symptoms, and up to seven to 10 days afterward.</p>
<p>H1N1 is now present in our community and will be spreading quickly. It's time for all of us to come together and protect ourselves and our families, and help to protect the vulnerable in our community. One way to do that is to get vaccinated. The vaccine takes two weeks to stimulate immunity, so it's important to be vaccinated as soon as it is available to you. That's what my family is planning to do.</p>

<p>A sampling of comments posted by readers on windsorstar.com about the LaSalle Vipers getting the H1N1 inoculation:</p>
<p>Proof that we live in an age of entitlement. First Calgary Flames, then Toronto Maple Leafs (and) now the LaSalle Vipers Jr. B hockey team? Where will it end? When someone in a high-risk group dies because they couldn't get their shot yet. Shame on the Vipers. Lost a fan</p>
<p>As a player on the team, I can tell you that we were all offered the shot and a number of us took it. We were told to come and get it if we wanted it and did not know that it was limited in supply. Sorry! Viper</p>
<p>Instead of picking on the little guy (i.e. the ones administering the shots), why don't you fire the ones who didn't get the vaccine/shots here on time. They knew this was coming for a year now!</p>
<p>Wrong People Being Blamed</p>
<p>It frustrates me to think that hockey players are considered in the high-risk (group). We have all been exposed to places and people who are sick ... and yet I know for a fact that people with an intellectual disability have stood in line for three hours only to be told they need a letter from a family member, even though they can make an informed decision.... Makes ya wonder who the priority is. Disheartened</p>
<p>Enough with this nonsense. Every doctor that is caught giving these shots to the people that are not high risk should have to forfeit (their) pay from OHIP for a period of one month. That would put the vaccine where it belongs. Suspend doctors pay</p>
<p>Why are hockey teams and staff jumping in front of people who really should be the No. 1 priority for this vaccine? This is disgusting. Then we have hospital administrators who meet once every three months (seven hospitals in Toronto) who put themselves in front of the line. The Leafs, the Calgary Flames, the Toronto Raptors? Give me break. These people cannot justify taking these shots while children are being turned away. Shame on all of them. Why?</p>
<p>People need to calm down. I believe that people need to realize that anyone on sports teams who has contact with other teams should be vaccinated. If the Vipers were to go to a game, and not be vaccinated, come in contact with someone with H1N1, and bring it back into the community, people are going to complain. Heck, people are going to complain no matter what. Also, H1N1 targets healthy young children and teens. Haha</p>
<p>Not one person should attend any more games for the next four years until all of these kids are done here or (the) entire current management and ownership are gone. Only way to teach these prima donnas for being so ignorant! The people of Sarnia and Calgary should be doing the same! The Spits should also dump this no class organization! Former fan</p>
<p>Not Fair! The government and Health (Canada) posted the criteria for inoculations. And physicians and health workers were supposed to follow the criteria. Obviously, this was not done in this case. For this hockey team to get special privileges over the rest of us is not right! Shame on the Viper management! Suzie</p>
<p>The LaSalle Vipers got the H1N1 shot and my six-year-old son is not entitled to it? I guess you can see what happens to the health care system in Canada when you are in a pinch ... only the privileged reap the benefits.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>

</p>
<p>The local health unit is investigating the LaSalle Vipers hockey team after players and staff were inoculated against the H1N1 virus, even though some team members may not classify as high risk.</p>
<p>"We definitely will be speaking to the physician who is responsible for it," Deb Bennett, director of health protection for the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit, said Saturday. "Everybody is aware of what the criteria are.</p>
<p>"I'm a little taken aback."</p>
<p>Bennett said she had not yet received return phone calls from the Vipers and thus could not yet confirm who on the team, if anybody, was vaccinated against H1N1.</p>
<p>But she said the health unit distributed the vaccines -- for which people have been standing in long lineups across the country -- to area physicians on the understanding the Ontario health ministry's guidelines of vaccinating people on a priority basis were to be followed.</p>
<p>The shots began a couple of weeks ago and were to be administered on a priority basis, starting with the most at-risk groups, such as people under the age of 65 with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women, children aged six months to five years, health care workers, and those who have had household contact with infected people.</p>
<p>Studies show that people aged 65 and older seem less susceptible to H1N1, but are more prone to acquire seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Vipers spokeswoman Gail Robertson confirmed that more than 30 players, staff and some volunteers with the junior B men's team received H1N1 vaccinations Tuesday night at a regular team practice.</p>
<p>But she said management decided to go ahead with the vaccinations, in consultation with team medical advisers, because one of the players contracted the flu in October.</p>
<p>"The reason we pursued the vaccine is because there was contact with a Viper player with H1N1," Robertson said. "We would not have pursued this if we didn't think this was serious enough to take immediate action."</p>
<p>Two Alberta health officials were fired last week for letting members of the Calgary Flames jump the queue for the swine flu shot.</p>
<p>Despite a national shortage, the Flames also gave the flu shot to members of their B.C. farm team, the Abbotsford Heat. The Moncton Wildcats also received the shots. Some members of the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Toronto Raptors also reportedly received H1N1 inoculations.</p>
<p>Bennett said the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit has turned away a number of people who waited in line at previous H1N1 inoculation clinics because they did not meet the high-risk requirements.</p>
<p>Controversy also erupted in Toronto late last week when it was revealed that some hospital's board members and donors were vaccinated ahead of those considered to be at-risk.</p>
<p>In response, Windsor Regional Hospital issued a news release this weekend saying it has not offered the vaccine to any board members, donors or family members of hospital staff.</p>
<p>"We have been adamant from the beginning that only our physicians, employees and community health care workers would get the vaccine," said hospital CEO David Musyj, saying it was "disturbing" to hear that some hospitals would allow donors and board members to jump the queue.</p>
<p>Musyj said close to 2,500 WRH staff and local health care workers have so far received the flu shot at the hospital -- a record number. Beginning Tuesday, the hospital will also be able to offer the adjuvant-free version of the vaccine to pregnant women or new mothers -- but only those who already have an appointment with an obstetrician there.</p>
<p>Like family physicians who've received doses of the vaccine, the hospital has had to sign an agreement with the health unit saying it would immunize high-risk groups first. If the hospital doesn't abide by that agreement, it could lose the right to administer the vaccine, Musyj said.</p>
<p>Musyj also pointed to the Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act, Ontario legislation passed in 2004 that, among other things, prohibits queue-jumping and preferential treatment when it comes to health care services. An individual found in violation of that section of the act could face a fine of up to $10,000.</p>
<p>For a corporation, the fine can go up to $25,000, but Musyj said he wasn't sure if the act applies to the distribution of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear what, if any, repercussions the physician responsible for the Vipers' vaccinations could face.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bennett said it looks like the local health unit has largely caught up with inoculating the most at-risk group in this area -- though she still does not know when the ministry will open up vaccines for the general population.</p>
<p>A flu clinic held Saturday at the old Windsor armoury downtown was lightly attended, with perhaps 500 recipients, compared to the jam-packed affairs over the last two weeks.</p>
<p>"I believe we have been pretty well able to cover all the high-risk groups," said Bennett, noting that nobody waited longer than 10 minutes Saturday. "This clinic has been extremely slow."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>HST to cost B.C. schools $24 million; Buses, paper, soccer balls, renovations all affected</b>
</div><div>Kent Spencer   </div>
<div>The Province</div>
<div>391 words</div><div>9 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>The HST will cost B.C. schools $24 million next year for everything from buses, paper and cleaning supplies to soccer balls, says a group of school treasurers.</p>
<p>The independent B.C. Association of School Business Officials says the upcoming harmonized sales tax will have a "significant effect" on the bottom line for students in the 2010-11 school year.</p>
<p>The association hired a consultant to estimate the impact of the HST by conducting an analysis of three sample school districts.</p>
<p>"Many costs not subjected to the provincial sales tax will be in the HST," said association president David Green.</p>
<p>Green said $50-million worth of school supplies and $26 million in contracted-out transportation were previously exempt from the provincial sales tax, but will face the HST when it comes into effect in July.</p>
<p>Green said the cost of those items will go up an additional seven per cent.</p>
<p>Not only operating costs will spiral upward, but capital ones as well.</p>
<p>The consultant's report found that the HST will increase contracts worth $330 million for earth- quake upgrades and renovations by $14.7 million.</p>
<p>The association is pressing for a 68-per-cent rebate on its HST costs, which Green said would leave schools with no increases in sales tax.</p>
<p>A government spokesman, meanwhile, said the government "recognized the HST will result in additional costs for schools." He said the added costs will be dealt with as a normal part of the budget process next year.</p>
<p>"Every year we develop a formula for per-student funding that recognizes the fact that, in some cases, costs go up," said the spokesman.</p>
<p>Nnew Democratic Party finance critic Bruce Ralston said the latest numbers are "another unanticipated cost of the HST." "It takes money out of the classroom," he said. "It's another reason why it's not a good tax." Ralston said cost pressures already facing schools include the elimination of the $100-million facilities grants, H1N1-associated costs ($300,000 in the Vancouver School District) and unfunded medical-service premiums for staff ($200,000 in Vancouver).</p>
<p>Vancouver school district chairwoman Patti Bacchus said the HST will add about $1 million to Vancouver's "extremely stressed" budget. kspencer@theprovince.com</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Healthy people asked to stay at home; Most kids have mild symptoms, don't need emergency care</b>

</p>
<p>In a bid to control the spread of the H1N1 flu virus, B.C.'s Children's Hospital is asking that no more than two family members go to the emergency department with sick kids.</p>
<p>"Emergency is a place where there are a lot of infectious diseases and a lot of other children and people that are sick, and it would be best if families will keep their healthy members of the family at home," said Dr. Ran Goldman, the hospital's chief of emergency.</p>
<p>The emergency department is dealing with a 50-per-cent jump in the number of daily visits and is asking parents to keep kids at home unless they have severe symptoms.</p>
<p>"I would say that we're seeing about 70 to 80 more children every day, compared to what we would see in other times," said Goldman.</p>
<p>"We do see, also, children that have more respiratory illness and are sicker than usual, but this is not unusual to a flu season that we see every year."</p>
<p>Goldman said most of the kids have mild-to-moderate symptoms and are sent home.</p>
<p>"Most of the children that we see in emergency have mild or moderate symptoms of the flu, and over 90 per cent of those children can safely go home and be treated by their parents," he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, B.C.'s provincial health officer, Dr. Perry Kendall, confirmed that his office has sent a letter to all sports organizations in the province, reminding them not to seek preferential treatment in attempting to get access to the vaccine.</p>
<p>He also said that the vaccine program would switch its focus this week.</p>
<p>"This weekend, the 25,000 doses of the unadjuvanted vaccine will be repackaged and distributed to communities around the province, and these doses will be targeted specifically at pregnant women who have chosen at this point in time not to receive the adjuvanted vaccine," said Kendall.</p>
<p>An adjuvant is added to vaccines to make them more effective. Some early worries that the adjuvant might be harmful to fetuses have been dismissed.</p>
<p>As of last week, there had been 115 confirmed H1N1-related deaths in the country, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>For the week ending Nov. 3, there have been 183 new severe cases of H1N1 identified in B.C. -- 79 in Fraser Health, 50 in Vancouver Coastal Health, 38 in Interior Health, eight on Vancouver Island and eight in Northern Health -- with three new deaths, two in Fraser Health and one in Vancouver Coastal Health.</p>
<p>In total, the B.C. Centre for Disease Control has confirmed 399 severe H1N1 cases in the province since April.</p>
<p>Of these 399 lab-confirmed cases admitted to hospital, 63 were admitted to an intensive-care unit. Twelve new cases have been</p>
<p>admitted to an ICU in the past week.</p>
<p>To date, 15 people with lab-</p>
<p>confirmed H1N1 in B.C. have died. In 14 of those cases, there were underlying medical conditions.</p>

</div><div>The Leader-Post</div>
<div>643 words</div><div>9 November 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Here is some H1N1 information from www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca], a Health Canada website, where you will be able to find out more about the flu.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is a new strain of pandemic influenza that is different from the seasonal flu. People have no natural immunity to protect against this virus. The H1N1 flu virus emerged in April 2009 and surveillance of its spread shows that it is affecting more young and healthy people than the regular seasonal flu, which normally affects seniors and young children. People with underlying medical conditions, and pregnant women, may be at a greater risk for severe illness.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus -- also known as human swine influenza -- is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs. This virus usually affects pigs, but has been transferred to humans.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus has caused primarily mild illness in Canada, but Canadians need to be prepared to respond to a potentially more severe form of the virus that may emerge this fall.</p>
<p>How is it spread?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is contagious and is spread the same way as regular seasonal influenza. This happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes and their germs enter the nose, eyes, or throat of another person. The germs can also rest on hard surfaces like counters and doorknobs, and can be picked up on hands and transmitted to the respiratory system when someone touches his mouth and/or nose. It is not possible to catch it by eating pork or pork products or through blood transfusions.</p>
<p>Contagiousness</p>
<p>More research is being done on how long a person can be infectious (be able to spread the virus to others), but it is believed that this period is for one day before the onset of symptoms and continues for approximately seven days after symptoms have started. The time it takes between being infected and experiencing symptoms is between two and seven days.</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>- Almost always</p>
<p>Cough and fever</p>
<p>- Common</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle aches</p>
<p>Sore throat</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>Decreased appetite</p>
<p>Runny nose</p>
<p>- Sometimes</p>
<p>Nausea</p>
<p>Vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>- Wash hands often.</p>
<p>- Keep common surfaces disinfected.</p>
<p>- Cough and sneeze into your arm, instead of into your hand.</p>
<p>- If you are sick, stay home until your symptoms are gone and you feel well enough to participate in all activities.</p>
<p>- If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant, have underlying health problems, or if your symptoms get worse, contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant or have underlying health problems contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are otherwise healthy, you should stay home to recover. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience difficulty breathing or serious shortness of breath, it is important to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Antivirals are drugs used for the early treatment of influenza. If taken shortly after getting sick (within 48 hours), they can reduce influenza symptoms, shorten the length of illness and potentially reduce the serious complications of influenza. Antivirals do not prevent you from getting sick.</p>
<p>Canada has a National Antiviral Stockpile of 55 million doses of two antiviral drugs -- Tamiflu and Relenza. Both are effective in treating H1N1 flu virus. This stockpile is enough for all Canadians who will need and want treatment.</p>
<p>Antivirals are recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe illness, and for people at risk of severe disease. Your doctor will decide if treatment is right for you.</p>
<p>Vaccination</p>
<p>Influenza vaccines (also called flu shots) help you to prevent getting sick by introducing your body to a weakened or dead version of the virus to teach your body to build immunity to it.</p>

<p>Question: I am allergic to seafood. Is it safe for me to get the shot with the adjuvant or should I wait till the non-adjuvant is available?</p>
<p>Answer: It is always advisable for those who experience a severe allergy to eggs or any other food or medication to discuss their condition with their health-care provider (physician or immunization provider). An individual assessment is always done to ensure the right vaccine is given and any extra precautions (e.g. longer observation period following immunization) are identified and available before the vaccine is administered.</p>

<p>Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach pulled out a win Saturday, collecting 77.4 per cent support from his own party members despite weeks of speculation he could fare poorly.</p>
<p>Progressive Conservatives counted 1,191 ballots Saturday, and 922 people voted against starting a new leadership race.</p>
<p>"We have a very big tent party, it's a democratic party, it's open, it's inclusive and I know that with such a large tent, a large party, there will be a variety of opinions," Stelmach said.</p>
<p>"Yes, (I'm) listening very closely, changes will be coming but they will be done in due course."</p>
<p>The week leading up to Stelmach's leadership review was marked by criticism of the government's handling of H1N1 vaccination clinics, poor poll numbers for the Progressive Conservatives and rumours the premier could fare poorly in the eyes of party members.</p>

<p>With all the hype about the H1N1 virus and media reports that sound like The War of The Worlds broadcasts to instill fear among the masses, people are left to wonder just what they should do.</p>
<p>There are many manufacturers capable of making this vaccine, so why is there a shortage? It seems to be more about revenue and where that revenue goes, rather than about quantity.</p>
<p>People seem to believe everything they are told, yet do nothing to help themselves. Look at any fast food restaurant and you will see kids playing on jungle gyms, swapping germs with all the other neighbourhood kids.</p>
<p>If you're that dense, the flu shot won't help. With the vaccine finally available, people are running for it (as they have been programmed) en mass. It's the perfect place from which to return home with more than you bargained for.</p>

<p>WE HAVE RELATIVES LIKE THAT "They're lonely. They're bored. They sleep during the day." -- Natalia Krawetz, a psychologist who is an expert on the behaviour of cats.</p>
<p>NOT TO MENTION WHAT HE LEAVES ON THE LAWN "Reuben is an avid swimmer, grass-roller, and general ruffian who starts out our walks white and comes home in various shades of dirt." -- Melanie Cassidy, who sells terry towel bags for drying your dog.</p>
<p>WE BUY TAKE-OUT FROM JOEY'S "Wherever you go here, you will find fish and chips that rival any in London." -- Prime Minister Stephen Harper, welcoming Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, to Canada.</p>
<p>THAT SHOULD BE ME UP THERE "I'm happy for John, but I wonder what more I had to do." -- Stevie Baggs, upon learning that teammate John Chick was named the Saskatchewan Roughriders' nominee as the CFL's most outstanding defensive player.</p>
<p>IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE "So, if they're expecting to see topless dancers in a cabaret show, that's not going to happen. It's girls in pointe shoes and dresses. It's not X-rated." -- Jorden Morris, choreographer of Moulin Rouge: The Ballet.</p>
<p>WORDS TO LIVE BY "When a woman is getting dressed, she should start with the coat. Check the weather first, decide which coat would be best, and base your outfit around that piece. Remember, your coat is like the wrapping on a gift. It is a large part of how you present yourself." -- Toronto fashion designer Linda Lundstrom.</p>
<p>WE KNOW THE FEELING "Acting is always uncomfortable. It is for me. I'm always in a state of discomfort and never satisfied." -- Jim Carrey, who plays Ebenezer Scrooge in <span class="companylink">Disney</span>'s rendition of A Christmas Carol.</p>
<p>DAMN YANKEES "I love it!" -- Sanitation worker John Freeman, as he was cleaning up the confetti and rolls of toilet paper thrown from the skyscrapers during the World Series victory celebration in New York City.</p>
<p>CAN'T SAY WE DISAGREE "And while on the subject of H1N1, how about a lot less sensationalism and fear mongering? All we need to know is when it is our turn to show up at the clinic for our flu shot. Full stop, please." -- Paul Heppelle, in a letter to the editor.</p>
<p>THERE'S A LOT OF THAT GOING AROUND "People are in shock and it's going to take a couple of days, I think, to sink in. It's going to be a very unhappy place." -- Union official Maureen Dawson, after employees at the Toronto Star were asked to think about voluntary buyout packages because the newspaper is considering contracting out more than 100 jobs in its editorial and production divisions.</p>
<p>IT'S A BIRD, IT'S A PLANE, IT'S ... EBENEZER? "The story that Dickens wrote in 1838 remains timeless, and if it's supercharged here with Scrooge swooping the London streets as freely as Superman, well, once you let ghosts into a movie, there's room for anything." -- Roger Ebert, in his review of <span class="companylink">Disney</span>'s A Christmas Carol.</p>
<p>SORRY, THE WIFE DOESN'T BUY IT "It was a pleasant surprise to find out we have a lot of really good athletes. I'm not going to say they look bad, but it's good to actually coach and be serious about it." -- Yo Murphy, head coach of the Tampa Breeze of the Lingerie Football League.</p>

<p>Every so often, the old European class system attempts a revival, albeit with money rather than heredity as the dividing criterion.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan people should not have to look farther than Toronto to decide whether we want private medical clinics in our province. Several private clinics there have obtained doses of H1N1 vaccine to sell to their patients, while those on the priority lists stand waiting in line, facing insufficient supplies.</p>
<p>This kind of queue jumping is exactly why many people with money really would like a parallel private medical system. For a few bucks, they can bypass the huddled masses, and feel both safe and superior at the same time.</p>
<p>Not only that, but with those of high influence taken care of, it becomes easier to ignore the less-connected public.</p>
<p>If we have one system for all, there's a greater incentive to make it a good system.</p>

<p>The lineup was short Saturday as the next eligible group for H1N1 vaccinations, children up to Grade six with an underlying medical condition, hit Prairieland Park to receive their shot.</p>
<p>There were approximately 50 parents and children waiting outside the doors at 9 a.m. when the clinic opened, but everyone was registered and on their way through in about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>People flowed through steadily the rest of the day.</p>
<p>A number of things qualify as an underlying medical condition ---heart disease, asthma, kidney disease, diabetes, weakened immune system, blood disorders and severe obesity.</p>
<p>Parents were not required to provide any kind of proof of the medical condition. A simple declaration, along with the names of the child's school, teacher and grade sufficed.</p>
<p>Children exhibiting flu-like symptoms, especially fever, were not given a vaccination at Saturday's clinic due to the concern that they may have an adverse reaction because they were already fighting off another virus.</p>
<p>Getting a shot in the arm is the last thing these children wanted to be doing on a Saturday, but they still managed to find some time to play.</p>
<p>During the required 15-minute waiting period after receiving their shots, many children left their parents to go make friends with other fellow vaccine recipients, running around and making shadow puppets on the screen from the light of the projector.</p>
<p>Reactions to the vaccine were typically minimal.</p>
<p>Some parents at the Prairieland clinic felt the danger of the pandemic was a bit overblown, but they felt it was best to play it safe.</p>
<p>"Bennett, our son, has asthma so I'm always a little bit more concerned about him," said Chandra Kretzer, who has two other children who do not have any underlying health problems. "I'm not 100-per-cent sure I'm sold on the whole panic that's setting in," said Kretzer. But, with H1N1 affecting the respiratory system, she did not want to take any chances.</p>
<p>Saturday's event was a special clinic to immunize high-risk school children before the regular school vaccination campaign begins this week. Beginning today, select schools in the Saskatoon Health Region will begin delivering vaccinations to all children from Kindergarten to Grade 6.</p>
<p>Parents will be notified when immunization teams will be going to their child's school.</p>
<p>More than 25,000 people in the health region have been vaccinated so far. Approximately 2,000 vaccinations were administered on Saturday at Prairieland, in the core neighbourhoods and through the Saskatoon health bus. To date, a total of 15 people have been admitted to the hospital in the health region with H1N1.</p>
<p>The Prairieland clinic will be closed for Remembrance Day, but open for the rest of the week. The clinic is still only open to children from six months to five years of age, pregnant women more than 20 weeks into their term and women up to four weeks post-partum.</p>

</p>
<p>To be or not to be (vaccinated, that is)?</p>
<p>Who can we trust for guidance? Is it Drs. Russell Blaylock, Leonard Horowitz or Rauni Kilde? I mention these names because I have been deluged by a tsunami of emails asking me if the anti-vaccine rhetoric - with which these self-proclaimed champions of the common man have flooded the Internet - has any substance.</p>
<p>One way of assessing the reliability of the stringent views of such opponents of vaccination is to take a look at what else they stand for.</p>
<p>I have long followed Blaylock's rants against food additives, aluminum cookware, fluoridation and dental amalgam.</p>
<p>A career in neurosurgery obviously does not confer expertise on these issues, but let's dig a little deeper into the mind of this man, a mind filled with conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>He opines that the social drug problem in the United States was created by the nefarious former Soviet Union "to weaken the resistance of Western society to Soviet invasion, undermine religion and make the youth unable to resist collectivism." And, oh yes, the Soviets were also responsible for an epidemic of hepatitis, AIDS, venereal diseases and highly resistant tuberculosis.</p>
<p>According to Blaylock, current attempts at health-care reform in the U.S. are being masterminded by the self-chosen "elite" (read President Barack Obama, supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and other such organizations) who want to establish a New World Order in which people judged to be a burden on the state, such as the infirm elderly and the disabled, are to be removed from society by positive or negative euthanasia. In Blaylock's esteemed opinion, "this is really not that far away from the German National Socialist Party's thinking." In other words, Obama's health-care reforms have Nazi overtones, with plans to reduce the population of elderly, who are bankrupting the social security system.</p>
<p>"Knowing they cannot easily pass a euthanasia law or just have them rounded up and exterminated, they (the proponents of socialized medicine) use the medical- care system to speed them along to their deaths." Totalitarianism is coming and, "as the economy worsens, which they can engineer with their Federal Reserve friends, people will be more accepting of such things as euthanasia on the elderly and terminally ill, the insane, the feeble-minded and the chronically ill." Vaccines are also one of Blaylock's many targets. He insinuates that the H1N1 virus may be the product of some pharmaceutical research project gone awry, or that it may even be a man-made virus purposely released by someone with the "Illuminati Depopulation Agenda." Blaylock appears regularly on right-wing radio programs such as the Alex Jones Show, where the popular topics are climate-change fraud and the supposed erosion of civil liberties under Obama.</p>
<p>This exemplary physician has also released a document about what people should do if they are vaccinated by force, a ridiculous notion.</p>
<p>To counter the dangerous effect of the vaccine, Blaylock suggests immediately placing a cold pack on the site of injection, taking cold showers, and ingesting a host of dietary supplements, ranging from fish oils and vitamins to astaxanthin and zinc.</p>
<p>And talking about supplements, this altruist icon also sells his own line of products, including Brain Repair Formula. There is no clinical evidence for its efficacy, and if Blaylock takes it himself, which I assume he must, there is at least some anecdotal evidence for it not working.</p>
<p>Horowitz, a former dentist, makes Blaylock look like an intellectual colossus. He believes that an international drug ring operating in New York is behind the origin of H1N1 swine flu, as well as behind its alleged prevention via vaccination. He, too, maintains that the aim is to decimate the population.</p>
<p>There's more. Listen to the man: "In the beginning there was only God and the 'word.' Word is sound, and sound is electromagnetic frequency. (That, as any high school student can tell you, is nonsense.) "The world began when the Creator's word acted on water, that is sound frequencies based on physics and mathematics were applied to water." This genius has now found a way to bring heaven to Earth with his "Water Resonator," which "displays the precise sound frequencies of universal creation to restore nature's resonance energy and electromagnetic purity of water." And what is it? It's a sticker that you apply to a jug of water. Of course, you can also apply it to acupuncture points for an "energetic blessing." Hallelujah! Then there's Kilde, a former provincial medical officer in Finland, whose video interview is splattered all over the Web. Again, the H1N1 vaccine was designed to diminish world population and put billions of dollars into the coffers of pharmaceutical companies and of Donald Rumsfeld, who "owns one." (Ridiculous.) According to Kilde, children and pregnant women are to get the vaccine first because this is the best way to eliminate the next generation. The good doctor's wisdom is also demonstrated by her belief that the Nazis visited the moon in the 1940s, that the U.S. government has inserted microchips into babies for future mind control, and that extraterrestrials have saved her life three times, once by using a force field to deflect an elk that jumped in front of her car.</p>
<p>So whose advice should we take about vaccination? That of mental Goliaths like Blaylock, Horowitz and Kilde, or that of the immunologists, virologists, toxicologists and epidemiologists at the World Health Organization, the Centres for Disease Control, Health Canada and leading universities.</p>
<p>You be the judge.</p>
<p>I'll be rolling up my sleeve.</p>

</p>
<p>Everything is big at a National Football League game; the tailgate parties, the stadium, the security, the press box, the locker rooms, the players, and even the cheerleaders.</p>
<p>My first NFL game was a dream matchup last Sunday between Philadelphia and the New York Giants. While it wasn't a classic, the sights and sounds were fascinating. Here is my experience in nutshells.</p>
<p>ADVICE</p>
<p>On my way to the stadium, I told myself to just pretend I have been here before. When I arrived at the stadium, I told myself one last time, "We all type our stories one keystroke at a time, so go in there and show them how it's done.'' Then I remembered I didn't have a laptop.</p>
<p>SECURITY</p>
<p>There was one main security check for the media; one of those empty your pockets, look in your bag and get frisked deals. I was so happy that my dirty underwear was in the bag at the hotel. We had to show our passes numerous times throughout the day. My pass passed better than Eli Manning.</p>
<p>STADIUM</p>
<p>Arriving in the press box, I walked to a window and looked out at Lincoln Financial Field. It was about two hours before game time and they were already doing a sound check on the referee's mic.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Eagles cheerleaders and one of the teams were warming up. Sorry, I don't remember which team. I opened my bag, but didn't see my binoculars. I remember when my wife asked if she could help me pack, I said there were three must-take items: 3. passport; 2. credit cards; 1. binoculars. I felt betrayed.</p>
<p>PRESS BOX</p>
<p>The press box is about 40 yards long, with four tiers of seating. I was in Row 4, four seats from being the farthest away from the field. I am not complaining, unlike one of the guys who sat near me. As he joined us, he said he had been relegated "to sit with you boys.''</p>
<p>As he chomped his breakfast, he lamented how he had the same seat for 10 years but now was with "you boys.'' It was the first time I have been a member of a 'you boys' club. I kind of liked it.</p>
<p>There were monitors everywhere, and during the pregame we saw a reporter out mingling with the thousands of tailgaters. The reporter picked up a piece of bacon from a guy's plate and then put it back. Hasn't he heard of swine flu?</p>
<p>Press box food</p>
<p>A long room runs the length of the press box, with a huge seating area and a buffet along one wall. Think of the Sunday breakfast buffet at your favourite hotel or country club times 10. There was bacon, sausage, fruits, salads, eggs and a chef preparing custom omelettes. All free. Having eaten breakfast at the hotel, I chose a salad and Mountain Dew. I wondered what would happen to all the leftover food, then saw Tony Siragusa on the field doing a pregame show. I didn't need binoculars to spot Tony.</p>
<p>That's not the end of the food story; at half time there was a new round of delights - roast beef, chicken fingers, chili, salads, fruits and gourmet desserts. I opted for the chicken fingers, more salad, chocolate cake and another Mountain Dew. Americans seem to love Mountain Dew.</p>
<p>THE GAME</p>
<p>I always thought there was no cheering in the press box, but three guys within earshot were not hiding the fact they were pulling hard for the Eagles. That, and eating and discussing their fantasy drafts, put in a good chunk of the next three hours for them. Is there anything more boring than listening to somebody discussing his fantasy team? By the way, how did Matt Ryan and Mike Bell do last Monday night?</p>
<p>One of them complained what a long day it was going to be. He was covering this NFL game and then sliding next door for the World Series. If he wants a gruelling day, maybe he should be deployed to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>From where I was sitting, you didn't get a sense of the incredible skill level of the players. There is limited perspective because of the distance from the field, and with Plexiglas in front of us, the noise Philadelphia fans are renowned for was all but drowned out.</p>
<p>That said, Donovan McNabb looked terrific and at times Eli Manning played like Michael Bishop. I thought the cheerleaders had a pretty good game.</p>
<p>The postgame</p>
<p>I followed the pack of reporters down to the Eagles dressing room. After taking an elevator, we walked down a path with mini fences on each side. Along those fences were autograph seekers, fans and some scantily clad young women who were likely groupies. Newspaper writers don't have groupies. Some TV guys, yes; but newspaper guys, definitely not. Maybe it's our stained shirts; I had Mountain Dew on mine.</p>
<p>Among those waiting was the incredibly charismatic Tiki Barber. Doesn't this guy get tired of smiling?</p>
<p>Suddenly a loud voice told us the door was open and into the room we trampled, like a bunch of reporters at a complimentary buffet. The dressing room was about the same size as the press box, with stalls along the walls and a huge empty area in the middle.</p>
<p>I scanned the name plates hanging above the cubicles to see where Michael Vick was sitting. I walked over, but he kept his back to the room while he dressed. He had one carry for four yards and the humiliation of having to take the kneel on the final snap of the game.</p>
<p>When he was done dressing, he quietly slipped out a side door. I never did see his face. I like Michael Vick and make no bones about it.</p>
<p>Members of the media moved from cubicle to cubicle as a group. Once they had interviewed the supporting cast, everyone wanted McNabb, the hero of the day.</p>
<p>After a brief one-on-one interview with Barber, McNabb was ushered into an interview room, similar to one in those hilarious Coors Lite commercials.</p>
<p>I noticed three things at the news conference: 3. what a genuinely nice guy McNabb seemed to be; 2. what a great suit and pair of glasses he was wearing; 1. that I wasn't the only one with a stained shirt.</p>
<p>As I left the stadium to return to my hotel, I thought again about the reporter who had to go from the NFL game to cover the World Series. I wonder if he claimed overtime.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hospital defends shots; Denies choosing donors for flu inoculations</b>
</div><div>AARON DERFEL   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>1007 words</div><div>8 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>The executive director of the Jewish General Hospital denied yesterday that 200 top financial donors were hand-picked to be vaccinated in the last two weeks, ahead of the rest of the population.</p>
<p>"It just isn't true," Hartley Stern said of a Gazette article yesterday that reported that "elite donors" were given priority for vaccination against the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>"I never ever authorized people to get vaccinated on the basis of their donation."</p>
<p>Stern, however, acknowledged the existence of a list of 200 volunteers - most of whom, if not all, are donors - who were vaccinated ahead of other volunteers. In some cases, volunteers were not vaccinated at all.</p>
<p>Stern said he did not have details about the list of 200 - specifically, what type of volunteer work some do or why they were chosen to be vaccinated before others.</p>
<p>He said some of the volunteers sit on various hospital boards and do not give direct care to patients.</p>
<p>Stern also confirmed to The Gazette that the Jewish General has already vaccinated at least 95 per cent of its staff, including such non-</p>
<p>clinical workers as plumbers, janitors and the in-hospital printers. That would be in apparent violation of provincial guidelines that only health-care workers and staff who provide direct physical care to patients were to be inoculated immediately.</p>
<p>Asked to explain how the hospital narrowed down a list of 200 volunteers for vaccination from a pool of many hundreds, Stern responded:</p>
<p>"You know, you ask a really tough question. ... Did I oversee every criterion that was met? No, I didn't. If I'm going to be faulted, and I'm going to be criticized - some of these volunteers probably ought not to have been given (vaccines), when we look back a bit - the fact that we were the first hospital to vaccinate all the critical staff and the first hospital to vaccinate all the really sick patients, we were the first hospital to volunteer to help the Agence (de la santé) deal with other chronically ill patients. On that score card, if we made errors in judgment on which volunteers got vaccinated first, I'll have to be judged on that basis."</p>
<p>Isabelle Caron, the Jewish General's associate director of nursing who is in charge of the pandemic-preparedness plan, also acknowledged that there was a list of volunteers for flu shots.</p>
<p>"There was a group that needed a list," she said. "I did not see the list. I don't know what's on the list and I'm going to have to look into that."</p>
<p>Stern said he has ordered an internal review to "cross-check the list of the vaccinated people because it's on paper records. ... But it's irrelevant anyways. What's the difference if some of these people donate?"</p>
<p>Reacting to the Gazette article, Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc told reporters that he disapproved of special vaccination privileges for donor-volunteers.</p>
<p>Marie-Ève Bédard, Bolduc's press attaché, confirmed last night that health-care workers who care for patients - not board members or janitors - were to be vaccinated first, before the rest of the population. "But we're not going to launch a witch hunt here," Bédard said.</p>
<p>Still, she noted that with the exception of Bolduc, who was vaccinated to set an example, none of the members of the National Assembly have received flu shots as yet. They will wait their turn like everyone else, she said.</p>
<p>"I visit hospitals with the minister every day and I haven't been vaccinated," added Bédard, a mother of young children.</p>
<p>Stern said he was personally offered $50,000 to have a family vaccinated and he turned down the person.</p>
<p>Caron, whose non-vaccinated son fell ill with the flu last week, said she also rejected cash offers for flu shots.</p>
<p>To date, the Jewish General has vaccinated about 1,500 patients with cancer and other diseases.</p>
<p>The decision by the Jewish General to vaccinate non-clinical staff and volunteers was not based on the concern that they might pass on the virus to patients. Rather, the hospital wanted to keep non-clinical workers in reserve in the event that a significant proportion of clinical staff got sick.</p>
<p>"As part of our pandemic preparedness, we made a decision that we would include volunteers in the vaccination program because we believe that if staff would (come) down (with the flu), we could count on our volunteers ... to help with some of the tasks to off-load some of the work," Stern explained.</p>
<p>Asked to elaborate on the vaccination of volunteers, Caron replied: "We have to give priority to the ones who are really on the unit clinically."</p>
<p>When informed that board members who do not care for patients had been vaccinated, Caron responded: "For this, I'll let Dr. Stern argue."</p>
<p>Stern said he was following the spirit of a government directive recommending that health-care workers and "other staff" be vaccinated.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hemsky heads Oil's lengthy injury list</b>
</div><div>Jim Matheson   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>772 words</div><div>8 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>OK, here's the Edmonton Oilers' roll call:</p>
<p>Ales Hemsky, shoulder. Out. J.F. Jacques, back. Out. Shawn Horcoff, shoulder. Out. Ryan Stone, knee. Out.</p>
<p>Sheldon Souray, concussion. Out.</p>
<p>Ryan Potulny, farm team. In.</p>
<p>Liam Reddox, farm team. In.</p>
<p>Ladislav Smid, flu. Somewhere in between.</p>
<p>That's four of the Oilers top nine forwards on the sidelines -- and two-thirds of their first line, which means coach Pat Quinn will probably have the blender out for combinations for the game tonight against the Colorado Avalanche. Sam Gagner and Dustin Penner will stay together on the top line with Patrick O'Sullivan moving up to Hemsky's spot.</p>
<p>Hemsky may have been hurt on Monday against the New York Islanders when Andy Sutton belted him three times on the same shift in the third period. Hemsky played against the New York Rangers on Thursday, but didn't make the trip here. Neither did the Oilers' most aggressive winger, Jacques, whose back tightened up on him Wednesday, but apparently it has nothing to do with last season's herniated disc that was repaired.</p>
<p>Horcoff wasn't on the charter, but may join the team on Thursday in Atlanta, where they'll wait for Sunday's game against the Thrashers. The unheralded Stone, who is sorely missed because he's a pain in the butt to play against, is walking fine, but hasn't made it near the ice since surgery 2-1/2 weeks ago. Souray skated by himself at the end of practice here on Saturday. He has missed 13 straight games.</p>
<p>"We've got an awful lot of balls in the air," said general manager Steve Tambellini. "Hemmer and J.F. may join the team in Ottawa (for Tuesday's game against the Senators)."</p>
<p>Jacques is on injured reserve, dating back to Monday. Horcoff is also on IR, allowing the Oilers to recall the two Springfield Falcons farmhands and stay under the 23-man roster limit. Hemsky is out day-today.</p>
<p>Souray can come back at any time because his long-term injury status (which means his $5.4-million salary doesn't count against the salray cap), is retroactive to Oct. 18, when he was hurt. It's well past the 10 games or 24 days LTI guys have to stay out, but Edmonton's most indispensable player isn't close to returning.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure when Hemmer got hurt, but Sutton is a big boy(six-foot-six, 240 pounds)," said Tambellini.</p>
<p>"J. F.'s back stiffened up. He's getting treatment. I don't think it's the same thing as before. I know one thing, we need him back (for his ability to protect the small forward crew)."</p>
<p>Jacques stepped in to fight Sutton after he checked Tom Gilbert hard. Nobody's sure if he tweaked it then, but Sutton was a dangerous opponent in the Islanders' 3-1 win.</p>
<p>Smid, the Oilers' primary shutdown defenceman, missed the Rangers game after not missing any time when diagnosed with the H1N1 virus last week. He didn't skate Saturday, and unless he wakes up today feeling 100 per cent, it doesn't look like he'll be up against Colorado's top line of Paul Stastny, Milan Hejduk and Wojtek Wolski.</p>
<p>Winger Chris Minard would have been one of the farm call-ups because he has nine goals in Springfield, but he's coming off a minor concussion. So Potulny, who led the Falcons in points last season (62 points, 38 goals) is up for his offensive ability, but will centre the fourth line with Ethan Moreau and Zack Stortini. Reddox, who was recalled even though he only has three points in 12 games on the farm, is on the way for his energy, and will play on the third with Andrew Cogliano and Fernando Pisani, who was cut in the face and needed stitches on Saturday after falling into the boards in a collision with Lubomir Visnovsky. Reddox played 46 games with the Oilers last season, so there is a familiarity factor despite being the last training-camp cut.</p>
<p>It's not like the cavalry's coming, though. Potulny (seven points in Springfield)and Reddox may only be up for a game or two, until Jacques and Hemsky are healthy.</p>
<p>"Neither Potulny nor Minard (signed in the off-season from the Pittsburgh Penguins), had good camps, and to their credit they both took credit for it. They didn't blame anybody else," said farm coach Rob Daum.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Can Chrysler be fixed? Fiat's Marchionne is taking a 'weird' approach to putting the brakes on automaker's demise</b>
</div><div>1115 words</div><div>8 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star    </div>
</p>
<p>Sergio Marchionne and his executives set the appropriate tone this week at their marathon, six-hour-long unveiling of Chrysler's rescue strategy. The strategy is bizarre, and so was the meeting.</p>
<p>In his impassioned windup to the more than 300 industry analysts, dealers, government officials and auto journalists gathered at Chrysler's headquarters in suburban Detroit, Marchionne quoted Bill Clinton, Machiavelli and Bobby McFerrin.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Marchionne, who spent most of his career in Toronto before a short stint with an Italian firm brought him to the attention of a then-crippled Fiat, had allowed earlier in the day that he bought a Fiat in 1968 in Toronto and was not impressed.</p>
<p>"If you had told me then I would be running Fiat, I would have laughed my head off."</p>
<p>Chrysler's salvation, should it come about, is entirely tied to its "Fiat-ization." To the adoption of Fiat styling, engine and drivetrain technology, and supposedly state-of-the-art manufacturing methods.</p>
<p>Decades after Fiat was driven out of a North American market where it had failed dismally, the stigma of "Fix it again, Tony" still falls readily from the lips of auto enthusiasts when the word Fiat is mentioned. Why remind us?</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Fiat's Canadian boss bragged that Chrysler's upscale Town and Country minivan, assembled in Windsor, is moving through Canadian showrooms like "chickenpox through a kindergarten class." Veteran auto analyst Nick Bunkley, who was live-Twittering the event, tweeted: "I can't make this crap up."</p>
<p>Marchionne has had precious little to say about his plan to restore Chrysler to viability since it exited bankruptcy in June. He did give one interview in which he complained that Chrysler was in much worse shape that he had imagined. A real confidence builder, that. Marchionne was at it again on Wednesday, boosting morale with his observation that Chrysler's in trouble "but it's not terminal"</p>
<p>This desultory tone was consistent with Marchionne's regard for Chrysler since Day One last spring. He insisted then that he would not take the reins at Chrysler, until Washington told him that was not on. He held out for a gratis 35 per cent stake in Chrysler until Barack Obama told him that was too greedy. (Marchionne had to settle for 20 per cent.)</p>
<p>He made war on Chrysler dealers by loading them up with inventory and then shutting them down. He fired the heads of the Dodge and Chrysler brands, posts to which he had just promoted them, when they broke Marchionne's directive not to talk to the auto press at the Frankfurt auto show. Omniscience and pettiness aren't an ideal mix in a turnaround CEO, whose troops already balk at keeping Marchionne's work hours. (The boss gets by on four hours' sleep.)</p>
<p>Despite four months to prepare, Wednesday's crucial tone-setting presentation fell flat. Not only from the gaffes, but the shoot-the-moon goals Marchionne proclaimed, described by one of the analysts at the Detroit event as "boldly delusional."</p>
<p>As one executive after another talked of doubling sales of a brand or boosting market share by unrealistic amounts, there were collective gasps in the audience. What are these guys smoking?</p>
<p>Still, it was a friendly audience. The auto press would love a Chrysler comeback story. There had to be a less petty way for Marchionne to deal with unstated skepticism than to say it is a "worldwide sport of beating people who are down."</p>
<p>The truth about Chrysler is that it's not down, but out. In a glut of global capacity, what the industry needs is for this chronically mismanaged firm to go away. Instead, Washington, Ottawa and Queen's Park have extended a total of about $14 billion in emergency loans to a company that hit the wall in the early 1970s, again a decade later, and survives now only on government life support - the latter an expression of goodwill that Marchionne might someday show some appreciation for.</p>
<p>Fiat has none of its own money on the line in this latest gambit to make Chrysler sustainably viable. It got its 20 per cent equity stake in the firm in exchange for taking on the task of fixing it. Marchionne has vowed not to commit a single euro of Fiat's own money to reviving Chrysler. Fair enough, since Fiat itself is bleeding cash back home in Europe.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Marchionne proposes to spend $23 billion (U.S.) to develop 21 new bestselling vehicles that will roughly double Chrysler's North American market share in the short space of three or four model years. To make Chrysler profitable in just two or three years - something that earlier Chrysler owner <span class="companylink">Daimler AG</span> could not do in nine years - and to pay off its $14 billion in government emergency loans by 2014.</p>
<p>Chrysler's sales volume has cratered by 50 per cent over the past two years. Its year-over-year market share has plummeted to 7.9 per cent in October from 11.3 per cent.</p>
<p>Where is the $23 billion (U.S.) going to come from, if not from Fiat? From a miraculous upturn in sales of Chrysler's current, unpopular product line, which will get a slapdash sprucing-up (inexpensive improvements to interiors, exterior trim and so on).</p>
<p>"It's cosmetics," shrugged Rebecca Lindland, of IHS Global Insight, telling the Detroit Free Press she cannot imagine that showroom dust-collectors like the Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Avenger are suddenly going to move like H1N1 through a crowded subway car.</p>
<p>Those 21 new Fiat-based models won't start arriving at Chrysler dealers for at least two years - the time needed to retool Chrysler plants, and for Chrysler hands to learn Fiat's manufacturing methods. That's too late. A resurgent <span class="companylink">Ford Motor Co</span>. will have replaced its entire lineup by then. Also, its other rivals won't be watching grass grow under their feet.</p>
<p>The real problem is the Fiat-ization of Chrysler. Americans have never taken to Fiat styling. Fiat is the unlikeliest candidate to erase Chrysler's abysmal reputation for poor quality. Fiat itself ranks in the bottom quarter of more than 20 brands in J.D. Power's latest customer satisfaction survey in the company's core European market.</p>
<p>The word crapshoot comes to mind to describe what Marchionne is embarked on, that's how pie-in-the-sky it is. Except in that game, you play with your own money.</p>

<p>Canadian soldier mourned</p>
<p>SASKATOON -- Citizens hung Canadian flags over a highway overpass and lined the route as the funeral procession for a soldier killed in Afghanistan wound its way through Saskatoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Lt. Justin Boyes was killed Oct. 28 in an explosion during a foot patrol near Kandahar City. It came only 10 days into the 26-year-old infantryman's second tour of duty. He was the 132nd Canadian soldier to die in Afghanistan since the mission began in 2002.</p>
<p>Among those who came out to pay honour to the young soldier was George Cook, a 90-year-old veteran of the Second World War. "I wanted to see a young man put to rest," said Cook. "It's just hard to let your son go into the battlefield when you know he might come home like this."</p>
<p>Gold-medal Ticket glitch</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -- The Olympic motto is swifter, higher, stronger -- but an online glitch Saturday morning left many would be ticket buyers grumpy, angry and inconvenienced.</p>
<p>They were among thousands who logged on to Tickets.com, the official ticket service provider for Vancouver 2010, hoping to snag some of the last remaining seats for the 2010 Winter Games.</p>
<p>Instead they found themselves trapped in virtual waiting room purgatory as two vital components of the ticketing website refused to acknowledge each other. In response to the website woes, the Vancouver Olympic Organizing Committee postponed the sale of the final 100,000 tickets until 10 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 14.</p>

<p>AN Ontario health unit is investigating after players and staff at an Ontario Hockey Association team were inoculated against the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The LaSalle Vipers hockey team is not the first to receive flu shots ahead of members of the public who are supposed to receive priority. Alberta's health authority has fired two people for involvement in giving Calgary Flames players and their families the H1N1 vaccine.</p>

</div><div>Terry McConnell   </div>

</p>
<p>On Canada Day, the Dominion Institute releases a poll that recounts just how ignorant Canadians are of their own history.</p>
<p>Well, ahem, we're not the only ones.</p>
<p>To commemorate Remembrance Day, a poll was undertaken in Britain by Erskine, a Scotland-based charity that provides nursing and medical care for British veterans. Sadly, that poll revealed one in 20 schoolchildren believes Adolf Hitler was a German soccer coach; one in six thinks Auschwitz was a Second World War theme park; and one in 20--presumably not the same kids who were ready to call Hitler "coach"--said the Holocaust was a celebration at the end of the war.</p>
<p>The survey polled 2,000 students between ages nine and 15, reports London's Daily Telegraph. As a result, Erskine will now take part in a nationwide effort to better educate schoolchildren about the two World Wars.</p>
<p>Soldiers know horror</p>
<p>"It is well that war is so terrible, or we should grow too fond of it."</p>
<p>--Civil War Gen. Robert E. Lee</p>
<p>Britain doesn't burn</p>
<p>This past Thursday was Guy Fawkes Day in Britain, a celebration that commemorates the day in 1605 when a guy named, er, Fawkes tried to blow up the Parliament buildings.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the festivities centre around a giant bonfire, but modern Britain's insurance and safety regulations are putting a dampener on this 400-year-old celebration.</p>
<p>Among those victimized by Britain's officious actuaries was the Ilfracombe Rugby Club in Devon, which was forced to stage what was billed as a "Virtual Bonfire Night" instead.</p>
<p>More than 2,000 Guy Fawkes revellers wielded sparklers as they gathered around a big screen that showed video footage of a bonfire. Heaters and a smoke machine were also brought in and the sounds of crackling wood were broadcast over loudspeakers, all in an effort to lend some authenticity to the event.</p>
<p>According to ananova.com,the</p>
<p>organizers opted for that instead of facing the mountain of paperwork and the resulting exorbitant cost to meet the stringent regulations involved in sparking a real bonfire.</p>
<p>Local celebrant Amy Collins was disappointed. "I doubt Guy Fawkes would have been able to blow up Parliament with virtual gunpowder," she said.</p>
<p>More health-care problems</p>
<p>Speaking of regulations, the radio commission in Uganda has barred witch doctors from advertising their healing powers on TV and radio. According to ScreenAfrica.com,the commercials violate Uganda's 1957 Anti-Witchcraft Act.</p>
<p>No respect</p>
<p>An eagle managed to skirt Sweden's penal regulations after it swooped down and snatched a little girl's pet rabbit for lunch.</p>
<p>The father of the devastated youngster called police and wanted the eagle indicted for murder.</p>
<p>Alas, reports the New York Post, the cops determined it is not illegal in Sweden for wildlife to behave like wildlife.</p>
<p>Road hazard</p>
<p>An elephant also avoided charges after it collided with an SUV--in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>According to the Houston Chronicle, a man and woman were driving home from church on a rural highway when their SUV struck the elephant. Evidently, the pachyderm had escaped from a nearby circus and was fleeing for its freedom when the collision occurred.</p>
<p>The couple wasn't injured, but police say the elephant sustained a broken tusk and an injured leg. No word on how the SUV fared.</p>

<p>"Woman Pleads Guilty In Road Rage Involving Salad Dressing"</p>
<p>--Headline in the Arizona Republic over a story that pretty much proves some people should not have ready access to condiments</p>
<p>Cat-scratch fever</p>
<p>As annoyed as that elephant might have been, you can be sure it wasn't any more perturbed than the household cat in Des Moines, Iowa, that came down with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>According to the Des Moines Register, the cat's owners reported it was sneezing and not eating. The feline was taken to the Iowa State University veterinary college where tests confirmed it had contracted H1N1.</p>
<p>Two people in the house had the flu before the cat, age 13, came down with it.</p>
<p>The humans and the cat all recovered nicely.</p>
<p>That's neighbourly</p>
<p>In other news from the wild kingdom, researchers have determined that female fiddler crabs put out for male neighbours who help them defend their homes.</p>
<p>Researchers from the Australian National University in Canberra found the male fiddler crabs will happily defend a nearby female against intruders in exchange for some crab nookie, reports the Australian newspaper.</p>
<p>'Aiiiieee! Jellyfish!'</p>
<p>"Japanese Fishing Boat Capsized By Giant Jellyfish"</p>
<p>--Headline at AllHeadlineNews.com over a story that pretty much confirms that maybe your average Godzilla movie is not so far-fetched</p>
<p>Move along, pardner</p>
<p>As crazy as that sounds, it's not any weirder than the response that residents of Columbus, Ohio, are getting from police when they complain about crime in their neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>The cops are telling them to move.</p>
<p>At least two Columbus city council members have heard about the cops telling folks to find a new neighbourhood if they're fed up with the crime in the one they're in, reports the Columbus Dispatch. A police union official says he understands if officers are frustrated with crime. Said Jim Gilbert: "It's like the OK Corral out there."</p>
<p>Having cake, not eating it</p>
<p>A bride and groom in Wales were just as stunned when they cut into their wedding cake, only to find it was made of polystyrene.</p>
<p>"It was a terrible shock," wailed the bride, named Aimee, from Pembrey. "I felt so embarrassed in front of all our family and friends."</p>
<p>Aimee, a bank worker, and new hubby Tony married in Cyprus, then flew home for their reception. They had pre-ordered the cake from local confectioners, but just four hours before the reception, Aimee discovered the bakers had forgotten to bake the cake.</p>
<p>"They admitted their mistake and said: 'Don't worry, we'll get you a cake.' They turned up that evening." Alas, it was all an illusion. The police were called and eventually the matter was settled in small claims court, reports the Guardian newspaper.</p>

<p>Quiz masters</p>
<p>Return with us, if you will, to the matter of the British schoolchildren and their lack of knowledge of history. Evidently, that is not their only educational shortcoming.</p>
<p>The following quiz was supposedly circulated to 16-year-old schoolboys in Swindon, Wiltshire, and forwarded to our attention by astute reader Roy Johnston:</p>

<p>RJ Currie, after Andre Agassi claimed he lost the 1990 French Open final because he was wearing a hairpiece and was concerned about accidentally ripping it off: "That's got to be the worst excuse ever; he lost because he was afraid of having the rug pulled out from over him?''</p>

<p>It is now alleged Oakland Raiders coach Tom Cable assaulted two women. Why can't he be like everyone else and stick to beating up assistant coaches?</p>
<p>One of the most interesting places I visited in Philadelphia was Carpenters' Hall.

<div id="hd"><b>Stelmach could not have wished for a better result; 77-per-cent approval buys premier precious time to prepare for 2012 vote</b>
</div><div>Graham Thomson   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>936 words</div><div>8 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Call it the Goldilocks number-- not too high, not too low. It was just right.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach couldn't have asked for a better leadership review vote if he had stuffed the ballot boxes himself.</p>
<p>He won a majority but not an embarrassingly low majority of 50 or 60 per cent that would have declared him a lame-duck leader. He also avoided an embarrassingly high 80 or 90 per cent that would have declared the party completely out of touch with reality.</p>
<p>When faced with the mandatory secret-ballot question "Do you wish a Provincial Leadership Election to be called?" 77 per cent of 1,200 delegates voted "No."</p>
<p>In other words, a considerable majority voted against turfing Stelmach. They are continuing to dance with the one who brought them a majority election victory just last year.</p>
<p>By any measure, Stelmach won a handy victory -- whether you measure victory as anything above 50 per cent or whether you measure it against a suggestion by former Premier Ralph Klein that Stelmach needed at least 70 per cent to stay on.</p>
<p>But just as importantly he did not stray into the stratosphere of 85 per cent or higher (a number predicted by some party officials).</p>
<p>If Stelmach had won a ridiculously high level of support from party members while the party itself is at 34 per cent support in the most recent public opinion poll that would have demonstrated a chasm of a credibility gap between the party and the public.</p>
<p>If there was such a thing as a "sweet spot" for Stelmach, it was somewhere in the 70s and Tory delegates hit it, if a little on the high side.</p>
<p>Stelmach was clearly tickled, seeing his victory as another example of how he has proven his critics wrong.</p>
<p>But did he?</p>
<p>This time around nobody was predicting he'd outright lose. Neither his outspoken critics in the opposition parties nor his whispering critics inside the Tory party expected him to get below 60 per cent.</p>
<p>What they predicted was that the party, acting on self-preservation, would rally behind Stelmach and give him an artificially high show of support. They predicted that Stelmach would then confuse victory with vindication--and refuse to change either the policies or the people in government that critics say have helped drive the government's numbers so low.</p>
<p>"Changes are coming," Stelmach assured delegates after the vote. But he wouldn't provide details or a schedule, adding: "They will be done in due course on my timelines."</p>
<p>The changes opposition critics are demanding include firing Health Minister Ron Liepert over the swine-flu vaccination program. Changes internal critics are demanding include firing some of the people closest to Stelmach including his chief of staff.</p>
<p>When pressed by reporters to name potential changes, Stelmach would only say: "I need the time to think it through."</p>
<p>He refused to get drawn into speculating about a cabinet shuffle and he seemed to reject any changes to government policy. The only change he suggested involved improving the government's faltering communications strategy: "Policies are right for Alberta; we're not getting the message out. So, we'll look at how we can get the message out better, accurate, clear, concise and we'll be working with the(party)executive tomorrow morning to discuss that and see how we can we improve upon it."</p>
<p>But Stelmach will have to do more than fine-tune his party's communications to win back supporters who, according to public opinion polls, have deserted the Progressive Conservatives for the Wildrose Alliance. And he will likely never placate the 700 or so angry protesters against health-care cuts who marched around outside the convention site at noon on Saturday while Stelmach addressed delegates.</p>
<p>Skeptics will look at Stelmach's 77-per-cent approval rating not as a sweet spot but as proof the party is out of touch with the 66 per cent of Albertans who indicated, in the latest opinion poll, they would prefer any other party to the Conservatives in control.</p>
<p>That 77-per-cent vote came only after party officials and MLAs spent months cajoling, begging and browbeating delegates to the Conservative convention. The result was a vote that was a good as it could get for Stelmach.</p>
<p>And, even then, almost one-quarter gave him the thumbs down.</p>
<p>After the vote, Stelmach said the dissent is proof he runs a "big tent" party with differing voices. Perhaps. Or it's proof that one in four party members are so dissatisfied with Stelmach they'd prefer the political chaos and bloodshed of another leadership race to seeing him continue as premier.</p>
<p>These days Stelmach has so many critics that he couldn't have won a complete, clear victory on Saturday, no matter the number.</p>
<p>But what Saturday's vote did do for Stelmach was buy him some breathing room. The critics inside the party will be silent, for now. He'll be able to face his opposition critics across the floor of the legislature with renewed confidence. Stelmach has more than two years until the next provincial election, expected in March of 2012.</p>
<p>Enough time, he hopes, for the provincial economy--and public opinion--to improve without him having to make too many uncomfortable or unpopular changes.</p>
<p>And, just like Goldilocks, he'll escape the clutches of the three (opposition) bears.</p>

</div><div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>308 words</div><div>8 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>An editorial in the Calgary Herald:</p>
<p>Those folks who are outraged that members of the Calgary Flames got their H1N1 shots should chill out--to the temperature of the ice the Flames skate on. And shame on Alberta Health Services for scapegoating and firing a senior staffer who was involved in making the decision that vaccinations should be provided for the team and their families. There was nothing wrong with making the vaccinations available to the team.</p>
<p>One of the most enigmatic aspects of the H1N1 virus is the way it has been singling out younger people in their 20s, 30s and 40s--the demographic of the Flames players. The team is at greater risk of contracting the virus because they play in a venue where thousands of people gather, and where they are swarmed by dozens of fans, including children. They travel to other cities, are in close, sweaty contact with the players of other teams, and when they are at home, they make dozens of public appearances, including visiting sick children in the hospital. Opportunities not only to contract the virus, but to spread it to hundreds of other people, are rife.</p>
<p>Apart from the public health aspect, it makes good business sense to ensure the team is healthy.</p>
<p>As for those who believe the Flames should have gone to stand in line with everyone else, it's worth remembering that these gentlemen cannot go out in public without being mobbed by fans, particularly adoring children. Vaccinating them separately was the most orderly, efficient way to do it, and the comparatively few doses of vaccine that were expended on the players and their families did not contribute to the shortage. The arguments of those who are irate about the Flames' flu shots rest on very thin ice indeed.</p>

<p>Pregnant women, toddlers and preschoolers were ushered straight in to get their H1N1 vaccinations on Saturday after lineups for the shots dwindled dramatically this weekend.</p>
<p>In St. Albert, Tanya Sloan, whose baby is due in six weeks, got her shot within minutes of arriving Saturday morning at the Grandin Mall clinic, where wait times were upwards of 2.5 hours just a day earlier.</p>
<p>"We had been on the fence the whole time about getting it done. We decided if we came here today and there was no line, I would get it, and if there was a line, we would wait," Sloan said.</p>
<p>On Friday, pregnant women and children in strollers had to wait in long lineups at the Grandin Mall clinic.</p>
<p>Mike Kluttig, communications director for the City of St. Albert, said the mall has felt at times like the largest day care on Earth, as kids younger than five and older than six months watched movies on laptops, ran down the corridors and played by the electronic rides in the mall.</p>
<p>To help out, city employees, clerical workers and emergency responders who have cross-trained as firefighters, paramedics and emergency medical technicians volunteered their time to keep the pregnant women comfortable. Ray Richards, fire chief for St. Albert, said Friday the volunteers reserved the women's spots in line if they needed bathroom breaks or time to get some refreshments and made sure the women had places to sit down and rest.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast, on Saturday morning, the mall was quiet, with no lineup at all.</p>
<p>There was no wait for the H1N1 vaccine at Westmount Centre, either. At noon, just three strollers were parked in a room on the main floor while parents took their young children upstairs to get their shots.</p>
<p>Esteban and Claudia Rivera said they were relieved their 19-month-old son got his shot so quickly.</p>
<p>"We came expecting to be here for at least an hour, and we were very, very surprised that we didn't have to wait," said Claudia Rivera.</p>
<p>"We went directly to the registration table and they sent us through to the nurse," Esteban said.</p>
<p>Several people, including seniors and child-care workers, were turned away from the Westmount clinic on Saturday because they were not eligible to receive the vaccine.</p>
<p>Alberta initially offered the vaccine to everyone starting Oct. 26, but the manufacturer slowed production just as mass clinics were inundated with people. In the face of a vaccine shortage, the province closed the clinics for four days and reopened them on Thursday, only to children older than six months and under five years old. On Friday, pregnant women were added as a group eligible for the vaccine.</p>
<p>Starting on Tuesday, two more groups will be eligible for the vaccinations. Families with babies under six months old will be able to choose two caregivers to receive the shots: two parents, for example, or one parent and a caregiver. The babies themselves can't be immunized, but risk becoming dangerously ill if someone else brings the virus home.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services said in advertisements on Saturday that the vaccine for parents and caregivers of babies under six months old in the Edmonton area will be available at the Commonwealth Stadium clinic only.</p>
<p>However, AHS spokesman Don Stewart said parents and caregivers who go to the other sites won't be refused the vaccine.</p>
<p>"Our preference is that people will go to the clinic at Commonwealth Stadium," Stewart said. "It will be one of the more comfortable locations should there be lineups."</p>
<p>The Commonwealth site is on the LRT line and has the largest capacity of the vaccination sites, with the ability to accommodate about 50 nursing stations compared with about 30 at the other locations, Stewart explained. It also has plenty of space so no one has to stand outside. Commonwealth will be best-prepared, with extra staff to handle the documents that parents and caregivers will have to provide, Stewart said.</p>
<p>"It helps eliminate situations where we have one of the smaller sites overwhelmed or we have other sites that may be underutilized. We are trying to manage our resources with our nursing staff at the stations."</p>
<p>According to the Alberta Health Services advertisement, people will have to produce a document that identifies them as a parent to a baby less than six months old before they will get the shot. That could be a birth certificate, hospital documents or documents from a nurse's or midwife's visit. Caregivers must have photo ID and should go to the clinic with the parents or come with a letter from the parents.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services is urging parents to leave their babies at home with another caregiver if possible, instead of bringing them to the clinic.</p>
<p>Children under the age of 10 as of Nov. 1 who have certain chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, can also come forward for vaccinations starting Nov. 10.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services will offer the vaccine to more high-risk groups as more vaccine becomes available, followed by shots for the general public.</p>

<p>NUMBERS GAME</p>
<p>When reporters arrived at the Capri Hotel in Red Deer on Friday afternoon, they were alerted to a bit of drama at the Progressive Conservatives' annual meeting.</p>
<p>Grumpy delegates discovered the ballots they would cast to vote in favour (or against) Premier Ed Stelmach's leadership were numbered, and immediately cried foul.</p>
<p>Tory organizers all but rolled their eyes at the paranoia.</p>
<p>"They're numbered so that we know how many we've given out," said Jim Campbell, executive director of the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta.</p>
<p>The party did not write down the numbers attached to the ballots. And, by 4 p.m., volunteers were automatically punching out all identifying marks to ensure votes were not traced.</p>
<p>"We do it every time and I suggest that anybody who's (here) knows that," Campbell said, adding he wouldn't speculate as to the reasons anyone would tip reporters off to numbered ballots.</p>
<p>Premier's spokesman Tom Olsen would speculate, however. "It's about causing mischief."</p>
<p>NORRIS BACKS PREMIER</p>
<p>Even on Friday night, just a few hours before the first votes would be cast Saturday, Tory delegates did not dare hazard a guess as to the kind of support Stelmach would see this weekend.</p>
<p>But after weeks of former MLAs and other disgruntled Tories airing their grievances, former Edmonton cabinet minister Mark Norris picked up the phone and called a number of reporters in defence of the premier.</p>
<p>"I think the premier's going to do extremely well, and I predict 75-per-cent-plus is a given. I also reject comments from former PC members saying there's some arbitrary number that's going to trigger further leadership," Norris said. "What I'm finding most offensive about all of this...is this piling-on on the premier. It's become completely unfair."</p>
<p>Norris ran for the leadership job in 2006. He echoed the advice of 2006 front-runners Jim Dinning and Sustainable Resource Development Minister Ted Morton: "This is absolutely not the time for a leadership race."</p>
<p>GIBBERISH DEFINED</p>
<p>Back at the legislature, opposition members kept the heat on the government through the week as more cracks in the province's H1N1 vaccination program showed up, from the clinics being halted to the Calgary Flames jumping the queue. Even independent MLA Guy Boutilier weighed in, using his private member's statement to define "gibberish."</p>
<p>Boutilier was booted from the Tory caucus this summer after he criticized the government for postponing a long-term care seniors facility in his Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo riding. At the time, Boutilier accused Health Minister Ron Liepert of talking "gibberish."</p>
<p>On Thursday, Boutilier said people in the coffee shops in his riding want real answers about what the province is doing about H1N1.</p>
<p>"They never have and never will accept gibberish as a response to Alberta questions because it's far too important," Boutilier said.</p>
<p>"In fact, one of them looked up in the Webster's dictionary what gibberish meant, and it says: 'Meaningless, unintelligible talk, also, babble, gabble, drivel, and googlygook.' I don't know how to spell googly-gook. Albertans as a whole believe in true accountability."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu fiasco spurs 700 to protest health cuts; Nurses, senior groups, students gather at Friends of Medicare rally</b>
</div><div>Archie Mclean   </div>

</p>
<p>As Progressive Conservative delegates tucked into lunch Saturday at their convention, about 700 people gathered outside to protest government cuts and hospital bed closures.</p>
<p>They waved banners, blew whistles and chanted, "No more cuts."</p>
<p>For them, the strong show of confidence by party members for Stelmach was beside the point.</p>
<p>"It was a message to the delegates that Albertans don't want to see Klein-style cuts in 2009," said David Eggen, the head of Friends of Medicare, who helped organize the protest.</p>
<p>Many of the protesters were union members from the United Nurses of Alberta and the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees.</p>
<p>Eggen said the high turnout was spurred in part by the government's response to the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>"People saw that as a test of the superboard, and it failed," Eggen said.</p>
<p>The coalition that organized the rally included seniors groups, advocates of the disabled, students and more. They came from as far away as Medicine Hat, Eggen said.</p>
<p>Jay Smith arrived from Edmonton to rail against what he said is privatization of health care in the province.</p>
<p>"I dislike the sharks in society, those who are predators," he said, motioning to the hotel hosting the convention.</p>
<p>The protesters marched around the outside of the hotel grounds before crossing the road and dissipating.</p>
