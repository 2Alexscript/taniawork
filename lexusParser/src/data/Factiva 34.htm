<div id="hd"><b>First doses of H1N1 vaccine sent to local doctors, clinics</b>

</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>The first doses of H1N1 vaccine for local residents in high-risk groups were sent out to doctors Monday morning.</p>
<p>But with a limited supply and some logistics still to be worked out, health officials urged a bit of patience until the program is in full swing.</p>
<p>"It does take a while to get it out to all the providers," said Karen Quigley-Hobbs, the region's director of communicable disease.</p>
<p>Patrick Nadon of Waterloo was frustrated after heeding expert recommendations and trying to get his son, Evan, 3, vaccinated right away because he fits two high-risk categories.</p>
<p>Nadon learned his family doctor isn't doing immunizations, then tried an urgent care clinic and was told it didn't have doses of the vaccine yet. High-risk people are the priority for vaccines this week, with clinics for the general public not scheduled to begin until Nov. 3. Quigley-Hobbs said it'll just take a bit of time for the vaccines to be distributed.</p>
<p>The region received its first batch of about 22,000 doses late last week, with another shipment from the province expected mid-week. Quigley-Hobbs estimated 75 per cent of local family doctors have agreed to give the vaccines. They should be the first point of contact for those in high-risk groups.</p>
<p>People who don't have doctors, or whose doctors who aren't participating, are advised to contact walk-ins clinics, which should have received doses Monday or get them early today.</p>
<p>High-risk groups include:</p>
<p>health care workers.</p>
<p>pregnant women.</p>
<p>children under five years and over six months old.</p>
<p>people under 65 with chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and asthma.</p>
<p>caregivers of infants or others at high-risk who can't be immunized.</p>
<p>The first three H1N1 clinics for the general public, to be held from 2 to 8 p.m., are slated for:</p>
<p>Nov. 3, Stanley Park Community Centre, 505 Franklin St. N., Kitchener.</p>
<p>Nov. 4, Jacob Hespeler Secondary School, 355 Holiday Inn Dr., Cambridge.</p>
<p>Nov. 5, Waterloo Memorial Recreation Complex, 101 Father David Bauer Dr., Waterloo.</p>
<p>Clinics for subsequent weeks will be announced every Thursday according to demand. More information is available from the regional health unit at 519-883-2289 or: www.waterlooregionpandemic.ca[http://www.waterlooregionpandemic.ca].</p>

<p>VANCOUVER</p>
<p>Canadians from coast to coast rolled up their sleeves Monday as the country's provinces and territories began vaccinations for the H1N1 virus, but for many the process was far from smooth.</p>
<p>In British Columbia, long lines were the norm at vaccination clinics, and some were even turned away due to vaccine shortages.</p>
<p>"There's quite a pent up demand. I think people have been hearing about the vaccine for quite a long time now and it's here and people are eager to get it," said Gavin Wilson, a spokesman for health authority Vancouver Coastal Health.</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced of the benefits of the hotly contested injection. Many Canadians are confused or conflicted about getting the flu shot.</p>
<p>In Ontario, doctors and health officials were doing their best to convince residents to get the shot, by appealing to their sense of duty, their flu fears, or just their sweet tooth.</p>
<p>"There was no pain whatsoever," said Dr. Bob Bell, chief executive officer of the University Health Network and a surgeon, who rolled up his sleeve at Toronto General Hospital.</p>
<p>"And there's a chocolate bar to follow."</p>
<p>In the Vancouver area, Wilson said turnout was higher than expected and one clinic had to turn people away after giving out all 350 of its shots. At a downtown Vancouver clinic, people waited up to 40 minutes to get their immunizations, saying they had no choice if they wanted to protect their health.</p>
<p>"I used to have hepatitis C and I got that cured but currently I have HIV so I want to make sure I'm really healthy," Shane Hutt, 37, said.</p>
<p>The lineups were even longer in Alberta, where residents waited up to two hours to be vaccinated. Alberta had asked that high-risk groups get their shot first, but had also said that no one would be turned away.</p>
<p>In the Alberta legislature, Liberal Leader Kevin Taft criticized the provincial government for having just four immunization clinics in Calgary and five in Edmonton.</p>
<p>"The organization is clearly not in place for this to succeed," Taft said. "Even if the current clinics run 24-7, the flu season may be over before a large portion of the population is immunized."</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach said his Tory government would do everything in its power to make sure everyone who wants the vaccination receives it.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Intensive care specialists who rode H1N1's rocky first wave are warning colleagues who've yet to see many of these difficult patients what they have in store.</p>
<p>ICU specialists from Mexico, Toronto and Winnipeg laid out their experiences before a standing room-only crowd Monday at the Critical Care Canada Forum, an annual meeting of intensive care specialists.</p>
<p>"There's very limited capacity to care for patients from the perspective of manpower and the perspective of machines and ventilators in certain parts of the country," Dr. Rob Fowler, an intensive care specialist at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, said on the sidelines of the meeting.</p>
<p>"That's because usually the need isn't there. And we're coming into a time when the need may be there and may be disproportionately there in some regions over others."</p>
<p>Fowler is one of several researchers internationally who are involved in trying to detail for the rest of the medical community what severely ill H1N1 patients go through and how ICU teams have managed to pull survivors through.</p>
<p>"Our system, whether we're in the middle of an urban centre in Canada or if we're in Nunavut or Northwest Territories is, I think, at the baseline usually stretched pretty tightly."</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>The nursery at Guelph General Hospital is expected to reopen today after a weeklong closure because of a viral infection among newborns that also saw several patients transferred to area hospitals.</p>
<p>Visitation remains limited.</p>
<p>"We didn't want to expose people unnecessarily," hospital maternal and child services director Louena MacInnis said Monday. She wouldn't identify the viral infection, but stressed it wasn't H1N1 or the seasonal flu currently spreading across Canada and other parts of the world.</p>
<p>The weekend before last, sixth-floor birthing unit nurses noted almost half a dozen premature babies were ill with what appeared to be a contagious infection. Tests last Tuesday confirmed the presence of a virus, MacInnis said. Working with health authorities such as public health, the birthing unit was closed to new admissions and a satellite nursery set up temporarily at the other end of the same floor.</p>
<p>Over the past week, seven patients were transferred as a precaution to other area hospitals in Fergus, Kitchener and Cambridge, at a rate of about one a day, MacInnis said.</p>
<p>Guelph Wellington Health Coalition chair Magee McGuire said Monday it would have been helpful if the hospital had made the outbreak public sooner, adding she only learned recently from staff at one of the other hospitals.</p>
<p>Having the information earlier would have allowed expectant mothers more time to prepare for birthing alternatives to the Guelph hospital, McGuire said.</p>
<p>Any significant restriction to hospital care "is really important to know," she said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, MacInnis said the babies that became ill are recovering well, with only two remaining at the General.</p>
<p>"Everybody else has gone home," she said.</p>
<p>Though the birthing unit nursery reopens today, precautions continue to be taken. MacInnis said visitation for the time being is restricted to two "healthy" adults per patient. No children are allowed.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Pregnant women are among the high-risk group advised by Health Canada to get the H1N1 vaccine early. But even though the vaccine was delivered to Guelph last Thursday, they can't be immunized until this Friday, when the public immunization clinics begin.</p>
<p>This is concerning to Peter Hamtak, whose wife is 25-weeks pregnant with their second child.</p>
<p>"I'm just so teed off," the Guelph man said Monday morning.</p>
<p>"I spent half a day on Friday trying to get some answers (from public health), and I got nowhere.</p>
<p>"They have the vaccine in a local warehouse. It's not doing any good there."</p>
<p>Jan Craig, spokesperson for Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health, said Friday the health unit did receive the vaccine, and it has issued a list of the public immunization clinics, that begin Oct. 30 and run Mondays through Fridays at varying times at College Avenue Public School until Dec. 23.</p>
<p>There will also be two clinics at public health's Southgate Drive location, on Dec. 29 and 30.</p>
<p>Public health is also offering immunization clinics in Fergus, Orangeville, Shelburne, Erin, Drayton, Palmerston and Mount Forest.</p>
<p>Craig expected the vaccine to be delivered to doctors' offices Monday or today.</p>
<p>"Doctors might be prepared to give the vaccine before our clinics begin. I would urge people to call their doctor if they feel they can't wait until Friday," she said.</p>
<p>Craig said health care workers will be immunized first - she received her shot last Friday. "We have to immunize our staff right away, so they can work in the clinics" she said, adding public health encourages high-priority groups, such as pregnant women and those with underlying medical conditions, to attend the earliest clinics. In the meantime, people in those groups should follow preventive measures like washing hands frequently and using hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>Public health is also giving vaccines to seniors for seasonal flu and that is spreading its resources, Craig said. Seniors are advised to get the seasonal flu vaccine but not the H1N1 vaccine as it seems to affect younger people.</p>
<p>The health unit received the adjuvanted vaccine that has an extra ingredient to boost the immune response. Craig said she expects a non-adjuvanted serum to arrive in the next week or so.</p>
<p>"Both are safe for pregnant women, but if she is over 20 weeks, a pregnant woman should talk to her doctor about receiving the adjuvant," Craig said.</p>
<p>Craig said it's difficult to hold clinics for high-risk populations only.</p>
<p>"People get rides from other people, or they bring their kids along. Then they wonder why the whole family can't be immunized at the same time. I can appreciate the anxiety, but we're talking about a few days," Craig said.</p>
<p>Hamtak said he's been doing a lot of reading about H1N1 and said that about one-third of pregnant women in the United States who became ill with H1N1 wound up being hospitalized. A wave of H1N1 hit the U.S. last spring.</p>
<p>"They had serious outcomes in the U.S. We don't want to be in that boat," he said.</p>

<div>The Leader-Post</div>

</p>
<p>(From The Regina Leader-Post, October 28, 2009) In a photo on Page A1 of Monday's Leader-Post, Lorrie Reed was incorrectly identified as a public health nurse. In fact, Reed is a licensed practical nurse. ***** </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus in southeast Saskatchewan's Sun Country Health Region is hitting hard at six area schools and is affecting a number of teenagers in 13 communities.</p>
<p>"We have 48 lab-confirmed cases," said Dr. Shauna Hudson, the region's medical health officer said Monday. "They've all been mild to moderate. We've had three inpatients, but they're all doing well."</p>
<p>The average age of those with lab-confirmed cases of H1N1 is 17.9 years.</p>
<p>"Twenty-seven of them are under the age of 15," Hudson said. "We have 11 towns and two cities that have cases now. We have six schools (Monday) in our health region that reported greater than 10 per cent absenteeism from illness."</p>
<p>She did not have the names of the affected schools or communities Monday.</p>
<p>Anytime a school reaches a 10-per-cent absenteeism rate due to illness, it notifies the health region. Six schools reported an absenteeism rate of 10 per cent or higher.</p>
<p>"Of course, that isn't all ILI (influenza-like illness), but the majority is," Hudson said.</p>
<p>On Friday, Sun Country reported 20 lab-confirmed cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>More than 7,800 students attend the division's 39 schools, which are spread over a large geographical area that includes Weyburn, Rocanville, Carlyle, Carnduff, Estevan, Fillmore, Pangman, Radville, Ogema and Yellow Grass.</p>
<p>Health-care workers in Sun Country joined their counterparts in rural Saskatchewan to get their pandemic H1N1 vaccinations on Monday.</p>
<p>Regina health-care workers will have the opportunity to get their H1N1 shots beginning today at the city's two hospitals, plus the Wascana Rehabilitation Centre and the former Robert Usher Collegiate.</p>
<p>Starting Nov. 2, depending on the availability of vaccine, regional health authorities will begin to deliver H1N1 vaccinations to at-risk populations --those with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women, residents of remote and isolated communities, First Nations and Metis residents and children, six months to five years of age.</p>
<p>All Saskatchewan residents are encouraged to receive the H1N1 vaccinations when mass immunization clinics are available, starting in the week of Nov. 16.</p>
<p>The symptoms of H1N1 flu are similar to the regular seasonal flu and include fever or shaking chills, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache and extreme tiredness.</p>
<p>Dr. Chris Vuksic, the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region's senior medical officer, urges people with mild illness, such as fever and sore throat, to stay at home until they are symptom-free.</p>
<p>"There are some groups who need some special attention," she said in a recent interview. "They may have a decrease in their immunity, they're weak or frail or women who are pregnant. We suggest they seek medical attention somewhat earlier."</p>
<p>Vuksic says people who are very lethargic, have a decreased level of consciousness or shortness of breath should seek immediate attention at an emergency department.</p>
<p>"We would actually encourage employers who have employees who aren't overly sick not to seek medical attention for a doctor's note," she said. "That's not going to be helpful for our system."</p>
<p>People with mild symptoms or who want more information about the H1N1 influenza are encouraged to phone the HealthLine at 1-877-800-0002. The free, confidential, 24-hour health-advice telephone line is staffed by registered nurses. The Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region has increased staffing to HealthLine by one nurse and is in the process of hiring additional staff.</p>
<p>Beginning Nov. 2 and running to Nov. 6, public health nurses in the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region will begin vaccinating children six months to four years with an H1N1 shot. About mid-November, public clinics will open for all Saskatchewan residents.</p>
<p>"When that H1N1 vaccine becomes available to individuals, we absolutely endorse and recommend that our clients and patients receive the H1N1 vaccine," Vuksic said.</p>

<p>As vaccination efforts go, the one under way (in America) for the H1N1 virus has not gone smoothly. Lower-than-expected vaccine yields have reduced the number of doses available, and this has led to the cancellation or scaling back of vaccination clinics across the country, including in Maryland and Virginia.</p>
<p>After eight years of talk about preparing for either biological attacks or life-threatening pandemic influenza, the performance is worse than disappointing.</p>
<p>Some of the pandemic planning has worked. When swine flu burst onto the scene in April, the government had contracts in place with five vaccine manufacturers that allowed it to immediately start the lengthy process of preparing a vaccine. The government runs 35 chicken farms for the sole purpose of producing eggs to be used in vaccine production. But in trying to get vaccine to people who want and need it, the process has run off the rails. Because swine flu vaccine yields did not meet manufacturers' initial estimates, filling the orders of states and localities has been pushed back by at least two weeks.</p>
<p>There's been considerable confusion about availability. Given the spread of the illness now, the promise that all who want the vaccine will eventually be able to get it is cold comfort. That's especially so for people deemed at risk -- pregnant women, those who live with or care for children younger than six months, people six months to 24 years old and people 25 to 64 with underlying health problems.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there have been problems in distributing the seasonal flu vaccine as well. Hospitals and clinics have been scrambling to make do with what they have, if they have any doses at all.</p>
<p>Congress passed laws to prepare the nation for pandemics and possible biological attacks in the aftermath of the al-Qaeda and anthrax attacks of 2001. Lack of progress became apparent during the planning for avian flu in 2005. There was plenty of talk then about the need to move away from egg-based vaccine production in favour of more flexible cell-based technology. Doing so would cut production time almost in half from between 20 and 23 weeks to between 12 and 14 weeks and would result in larger amounts of vaccine per lot. But the first facility to employ cell-based technology, which comes online next month, isn't expected to be able to manufacture U.S.-licensed flu vaccine until 2011.</p>
<p>Swine flu is spreading rapidly and overwhelming clinics and hospitals, but it is still considered relatively mild. The best way to protect yourself and others remains washing your hands or using hand sanitizer, covering your cough or sneeze, and staying home from work or school if you or your children feel sick.</p>
<p>But had the H1N1 virus mutated into something more virulent over the summer, the nation's inadequate infrastructure and inability to respond efficiently would have been even more consequential. In some ways, the federal government caught a lucky break with H1N1. But when it comes to the public's health, depending on luck isn't good enough.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Canada is importing adjuvant-free H1N1 vaccine from Australia for pregnant women, hoping to be able to offer that product sooner than if it waits for unadjuvanted vaccine from Canada to make it through the licensing process.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq announced yesterday she signed an interim order that will allow 200,000 doses of adjuvant-free vaccine from CSL Ltd. to be used in this country.</p>
<p>The CSL vaccine should be available starting next week, said Dr. David Butler-Jones, head of the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>"We have heard the concerns about pregnant women about having to wait for an unadjuvanted vaccine and we have been working very hard on providing it earlier, given they have always been considered a priority group," Aglukkaq said at a news conference in Ottawa.</p>
<p>CSL doesn't have a licence to sell flu vaccine in Canada but the product is licensed in Australia and the United States.</p>
<p>Pregnant women are at higher risk from flu viruses in general and this virus in particular. As a consequence, the World Health Organization has urged countries to put them near the front of the line for vaccination efforts.</p>
<p>The WHO has also recommended that because there are no studies on the use of adjuvanted vaccine in pregnant women, that countries should provide pregnant women with vaccine without adjuvants if that is an option.</p>
<p>Most of Canada's 50.4 million doses of H1N1 vaccine will contain an adjuvant, an additive that boosts the immune system's response to the vaccine. That vaccine, made at Ste-Foy, Que., by GlaxoSmithKline, was approved by Health Canada last week.</p>
<p>An order for unadjuvanted vaccine was placed after the main order, and that product requires a separate licence. Federal officials have said it should be available in the first half of November.</p>
<p>In the meantime, they don't want pregnant women to have to wait, especially those living in remote communities.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said the logistical challenge of vaccinating in northern and remote settings was one of the drivers of the decision to buy the CSL vaccine. In those communities, vaccinators are flying in, holding clinics then moving on.</p>

<p>Vaccine gridlock took hold yesterday as a stream of people seeking swine flu shots crossed Governor's Road, into the parking lot of Dundas Baptist Church.</p>
<p>It was the city's first public H1N1 vaccine clinic and was open from 1 to 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Parked cars filled side streets for at least three blocks.</p>
<p>A car nearly drove into two people crossing the road to the clinic before police arrived and stopped traffic to allow crossings. But many braved the long line, to get the shot as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Denise Bond said her son, 5, is high risk because of severe asthma.</p>
<p>"I wanted to get it done as soon as possible because their school's got a lot of H1N1 already. I think they said about 14 cases."</p>
<p>She said her kids attend Sir William Osler Elementary School.</p>
<p>In early afternoon, the wait was about 1 1/2 hours. The line trailed from inside the church, onto the sidewalk and stayed about 100 strong.</p>
<p>One man sat on his own portable stool and read a fat book while he waited. Another with a bad back took a perch on a nearby rock.</p>
<p>Kids in bright jackets, some in strollers, waited side by side with middle-aged adults and the elderly.</p>
<p>People were given a consent and information form to complete in line. Once they reached a nurse, the form was reviewed, any gaps filled in and a shot was given.</p>
<p>Public health staff said last night that about 1,750 people were vaccinated at the Dundas clinic yesterday.</p>
<p>Public health had 55 staff on hand, most of whom were nurses.</p>
<p>Public clinics in various locations this week are only for people in a high-risk group, such as those with compromised immune systems, chronic illnesses and kids from six months to less than five years old.</p>
<p>The city is planning more clinics next week for the rest of the public.</p>
<p>It will decide today or tomorrow on next week's clinic schedule and post it on its website.</p>
<p>"Right now we're just waiting on more information from the ministry on the vaccine shipments," said Marcia Matthews, mass-immunization clinic lead.</p>
<p>When asked how sure a Nov. 2 start date was for the clinics for the wider public, public health spokesperson Tara Hall said: "That's when we're expecting it, but it's this moving target."</p>
<p>Clinics will be held at the same four locations used this week for at least the first five weeks, but depending on demand, clinics may not be held daily, Matthews said.</p>
<p>A schedule will likely be posted on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>Matthews said the vaccine is offered to local doctors' offices and, if accepted, could be available at those offices as early as tomorrow, but still only for those in the high-risk group.</p>
<p>Matthews said the clinics operate on a honour system -- no one verifies people belong to the high-risk group.</p>

<p>Nearly one-third of local public schools are battling respiratory outbreaks as the second wave of H1N1 influenza sweeps Hamilton.</p>
<p>Public health officials have identified outbreaks in 32 of 114 schools in the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board, with all but one at elementary schools.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight of the outbreaks have been declared since the beginning of last week, as schools reported a surge in the number of students absent with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"The outbreaks are across the city; there is no specific geographical area where it's happening," said Jackie Penman, spokesperson for the public school board.</p>
<p>"We only had one or two schools prior to last week and then it definitely spiked."</p>
<p>Outbreaks were also declared at six of the 57 schools in Hamilton's Catholic school board yesterday, down from nine schools on Friday.</p>
<p>Those numbers are expected to change as absences grow among secondary students, said Jackie Bajus, superintendent of education for the board.</p>
<p>"It's definitely starting to hit the older kids," she said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, emergency rooms were "inundated" with people experiencing flu symptoms over the weekend, said Bill Krizmanich, chief of emergency medicine at Hamilton Health Sciences. The flood of patients is straining emergency departments and driving wait times higher.</p>
<p>People experiencing mild symptoms should call their family doctors and only use emergency rooms if they are severely ill, he said.</p>
<p>"We still have to maintain our responsibility to treat all those patients who don't have flu."</p>
<p>Hamilton's public health department is notified when more than 5 per cent of students in a school stay home with flu-like symptoms such as coughing, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headaches, chills and fever.</p>
<p>Public health then monitors the school for several days, looking for signs of ongoing transmission, before declaring an outbreak.</p>
<p>The public health department isn't testing for the H1N1 virus in every school, but there's "a good chance" it's behind most of the respiratory outbreaks, said Dr. Chris Mackie, Hamilton's associate medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"I'll put it this way -- we haven't identified any outbreaks that aren't pandemic H1N1," he said.</p>
<p>One school in the public board reported 30 per cent of its students absent, though some may have been kept home for other reasons or as a preventive measure, said John Forbeck, superintendent of staff and community engagement. He declined to identify the school.</p>
<p>In Halton as of yesterday, 23 of the region's 140 Catholic and public schools had at least 5 per cent of students away following a dramatic increase last week, said Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton's medical officer of health. Nine schools reported 10 per cent or more of their students absent with flu-like symptoms, he added.</p>
<p>The first wave of H1N1 arrived in Halton in the spring, hitting Oakville schools first before spreading to Burlington. This time, the virus is scattered throughout the region, Nosal said, causing the most illness in Burlington schools.</p>
<p>In Hamilton, letters are sent home advising parents that a school has more than 5 per cent absenteeism and reminding them of needed precautions. Halton isn't declaring outbreaks so no letters are sent home.</p>
<p>The Hamilton and Halton school boards have arranged additional daily cleaning in schools with specific instructions to disinfect surfaces. The public board also called a special meeting of principals yesterday to review flu protocols.</p>

</p>
<p>Day 1 of Montreal's massive vaccination program got off to a confusing non-start yesterday as health authorities scrambled with "shipping and handling" issues.</p>
<p>As immunizations of priority groups - including pregnant women - began in many provinces and territories across Canada yesterday, the Montreal Health and Social Services Agency began distributing 155,000 doses among 89 health facilities.</p>
<p>There were no vaccines available for first responders, health workers and the gravely ill, contrary to Friday's much-publicized campaign launch.</p>
<p>In addition to the confusion, a few dozen people showed up at vaccine sites - notably the Olympic Stadium and the Palais de congrès - that have yet to open, and they also called local clinics about where to go to pre-register for the inoculation. (No registration is required.)</p>
<p>Chief among the callers to the agency? Physicians seeking information about where to go for their own shots.</p>
<p>But health officials responsible for the campaign dismissed the delay as a minor hiccup and say the vaccination schedule is still on track even though most hospitals have yet to receive vaccine.</p>
<p>The initial wave of flu shots for front-line workers is to be handled within hospitals, long-term care centres and other workplaces, under the direction of health agency's 12 local Health and Social Service Centres (CSSS).</p>
<p>But as of last night, not all of the doses were distributed.</p>
<p>"This is a massive campaign with a goal of 1.4 million people, and it's never been done before," said health agency spokesperson Chantal Huot.</p>
<p>"Once the rhythm is established, it will get better and better," she said.</p>
<p>The agency is to finish the process of delivering the rest of the initial batch of doses today.</p>
<p>The first shipment of vaccine is intended for an initial group of about 90,000 people on the vaccination list, but they can't all be inoculated at the same time, Huot said.</p>
<p>"We didn't say that all will be done at once, but gradually," Huot said.</p>
<p>"This is a minor adjustment of 24 hours, and I don't think it will change anything."</p>
<p>CSSS Dorval/Lachine/</p>
<p>LaSalle, which covers a large portion of the West Island, was the first to get its batch of vaccine yesterday. It is to start vaccinating staff as of 2:30 this afternoon.</p>
<p>But some Montreal hospitals do not know when they will start vaccinating employees or their very sick patients.</p>
<p>"We have no precise date, but (it will be) this week," said Lucie Dufresne of the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal. "As soon as the vaccine comes in, we will start vaccinating our most at risk."</p>
<p>Health-care workers at the CHUM's three hospitals will be vaccinated over several days, beginning Nov. 2, in cafeterias and auditoriums, weekdays and weekends, she said.</p>
<p>The McGill University Health Centre is also planning a Nov. 2 start date for its employees.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, 80 deaths in Canada had been linked to the virus, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Warning: Vaccine misinformation is contagious; Many are choosing to believe unsubstantiated rumours on the Web rather than listen to experts</b>
</div><div>Catherine D'amico   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>915 words</div><div>27 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>I am a family physician and I am going to get my H1N1 flu shot and so are my children. I hope that my fellow Canadians will too.</p>
<p>Based on what occurred in the Southern Hemisphere during their winter this year, it is expected that about 80 per cent or more of the influenza virus circulating this year will be H1N1 and about 20 per cent seasonal flu.</p>
<p>There is a lot of misinformation being passed from person to person about the flu vaccine. And unfortunately many are simply accepting what they hear as fact. Why do people who would never use <span class="companylink">Google</span>, or the opinions of friends and colleagues, to decide that they knew more than their lawyer, engineer or architect, decide that they know better than their physicians? Or the PhDs in immunology and microbiology and public health staff who research these issues for months to years, and have the scientific background to be able to truly evaluate the research and safety data?</p>
<p>How could all the scientists and physicians and governments in every province, state and country in the world who are all looking at the data and recommending vaccination be wrong?</p>
<p>Here are the facts: The seasonal flu vaccine and H1N1 vaccine are called subunit vaccines and do not introduce live or whole flu virus into the body.</p>
<p>The flu vaccine delivers a minute quantity of a sterilized, purified portion of the influenza virus into the body. The immune system is then stimulated to respond and in about two weeks this results in immunity.</p>
<p>Someone who gets the flu, has had whole, live, influenza virus enter their body through their nose and mouth. The influenza virus attaches to the nasopharynx cells, then enters and reproduces within them. Millions and millions of live viruses are then released, teaming throughout the person's body and bloodstream.</p>
<p>This is an overwhelming attack and as the battle ensues and the immune system fights, the temperature rises, the body fatigues, and the symptoms of influenza result. Most cases of H1N1 have been mild, but as we have seen, for some, and sometimes randomly, the battle is severe and death results.</p>
<p>Why would you choose for yourself, or much more importantly for your child, to come into contact with the live virus, and submit to millions and millions of live, replicating viruses circulating for days and days? Does it not make more sense to instead get a vaccine that injects a sterilized and killed tiny portion of that same virus? I have chosen this option for my children and for myself (including during my pregnancies) for over a decade and have no regrets.</p>
<p>The problem with subunit vaccines is that since they contain only a part of the virus, they often cannot stimulate a complete immune response, especially in those with weak immune systems such as young children, the elderly, or those with chronic diseases.</p>
<p>For that reason, scientists add adjuvants to vaccines. Adjuvants are immune-system stimulators that enhance the response to the vaccine. The H1N1 vaccine contains an oil-in-water adjuvant called squalene. Squalene is a naturally occurring sterilized oil. Oil-in-water adjuvants have been studied and approved as safe and are used in various European vaccines including their flu shots.</p>
<p>Something that really puzzles me is how quickly people will put into their own and their children's bodies anything labelled as an immune stimulant if it is sold in a natural products store. These products do not have long-term safety data, are much less rigorously tested for safety than vaccines and adjuvants, and claims are often supported by poor quality studies that were done by the companies selling the product.</p>
<p>There is a question I am frequently asked: If the nurses, paramedics and hospital workers are not getting vaccinated, doesn't that suggest that I should be concerned about getting vaccinated?</p>
<p>It is interesting that the rate of vaccination among health care workers is similar to the rate in the general population. The reason for this seems to be that health care workers obtain their information about the vaccine and influenza in the same way as the public. They <span class="companylink">Google</span>, read newspapers and talk among themselves. There are no requirements for health care workers to participate in any accredited educational programs related to vaccines or influenza.</p>
<p>To protect those at high risk from influenza, in whom the vaccine does not protect well due to their weak immune response, it is important that their caregivers be vaccinated so that they do not infect them.</p>
<p>It is particularly concerning that health care workers could infect or kill our most vulnerable by choosing not to be vaccinated. Research indicates that H1N1 is infectious one day before symptoms, and up to seven to 10 days afterwards.</p>
<p>H1N1 is present in our community and will be spreading quickly. It's time for all of us to come together and protect ourselves and our families, and help to protect the vulnerable in our community. One way to do that is to get vaccinated.</p>

<p>People who feel their good health excludes them from requiring flu vaccinations are wrong. They need to understand it is not all about them.</p>
<p>I go through my days making contact with numerous individuals. If I have the virus, it could be in my system for several days before fully declaring itself.</p>
<p>During this period, I could pass it along to people at risk. While I might have a mild illness, I could do real harm to others.</p>
<p>This is the reason viral influenza is so sinister. I am a health care worker and have two "apparently healthy" young-adult daughters. I will be getting the H1N1 vaccine as soon as it is made available to me. So should everyone.</p>

<p>Re: Swine flu shot? Not for this little piggy, Oct. 24</p>
<p>As a child, I was hospitalized during the 1968 flu pandemic and now I have multiple sclerosis. Researchers suspect that there is a viral component to MS. I am the only one of my siblings with MS and the only one who was hit with the flu as a child.</p>
<p>The flu is not as benign as columnist Shelley Fralic makes it out to be. Get the flu shot, people.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Experts consider triage in H1N1 worst-case scenario; Medical leaders wrestle with who would get treatment and who would not if system is overwhelmed</b>

</p>
<p>As Canada officially enters the second wave of human swine flu, leading medical experts gathering in Toronto on Tuesday will discuss the worst case scenario: in the remote event that the pandemic overwhelms intensive care units, who goes to the ICU, and who doesn't?</p>
<p>Should scarce resources go to the people most likely to survive? Should triage occur on a first-come, first-served basis? If both have equal chances of survival, should the last available ventilator go to the 20-year-old over the 60-year-old, who has had 40 more years of life?</p>
<p>"I know this is an area that people just don't like talking about, in part because I think we all want to say we don't have to do triage in 2009 in one of the richest countries in the world, that we have resources for all," said Dr. Robert Fowler, a critical care physician at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and member of the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group.</p>
<p>"That's true to a degree, but it's definitely not true to the nth degree."</p>
<p>Fowler said Quebec, Ontario and B.C. are seeing increased H1N1 activity in the community. "That's starting to result in increased cases in the ICUs."</p>
<p>During an outbreak of swine flu in Winnipeg in June, intensive care beds at the Health Sciences Centre were filled with H1N1 patients suffering severe acute respiratory distress requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. One critical care doctor described them as the sickest patients he had have ever seen. The hospital has since made plans to double the number of ICU beds, if needed.</p>
<p>Experts say that, unless there is a dramatic change in the H1N1 virus or how sick it makes people, the possibility of critically ill H1N1 patients swamping intensive care units is exceedingly remote.Hospitals are preparing to increase their ICU "surge" capacity and share ventilators and other critical care resources if needed.</p>
<p>But still they say it is wise to prepare, "because if the unthinkable happens, you don't want to make these decisions on an ad hoc basis, with incomplete consideration and information," said Dr. Anand Kumar, an intensivist with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority.</p>
<p>Doctors say there are no national guidelines in place to help with those life-and-death choices. Without some federal-level guidance, "and because nobody knows what the legal liability is in doing so", Kumar said, "people are going to be very reluctant to use triage."</p>
<p>Yet with thousands of Canadians lining up to receive the vaccination on Monday, the first day it was available, officials are hopeful that such decisions won't have to be made.</p>
<p>The vaccine is being offered for free across the country to Canadians over six months old who are believed to be most at risk of flu-related complications, such as those with chronic medical conditions, children between the ages of six months and five years, pregnant woman and health-care workers. The general public will be included in November.</p>
<p>Canada, meanwhile, has bought additional H1N1 vaccine from Australia so that pregnant woman can get their recommended shot sooner than expected, the federal government announced Monday.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said she signed a special order to allow for the purchase of 200,000 doses of the unadjuvanted version of the vaccine from an Australian manufacturer called CSL Australia.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said the additional supply of unadjuvanted vaccine was secured because of the rising rates of H1N1 cases in Canada.</p>
<p>"While the order being produced by GSK in Canada is still on target for delivery in early November, we felt that given the increase in cases of H1N1 flu virus across the country it was prudent to offer pregnant women earlier access to the unadjuvanted vaccine," the minister said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Lines containing hundreds of people snaked through shopping malls, local arenas and community centres, as mothers and fathers pushing strollers, seniors, pregnant women and other Canadians believed to be most at risk of serious flu complications lined up before clinics opened.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, a west-end clinic had to turn away prospective patients after it became clear by mid-afternoon that the wait time was about four hours and that nurses would not be able to immunize everyone by closing time.</p>
<p>Montrealers, however, were left in limbo as health department officials scrambled to distribute 155,000 doses of the vaccine that were delivered to the city over the weekend. That means workers at most Montreal hospitals, who were expected to start receiving their shots Monday, will not get their jabs until next week.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 spread may force surgeries to be cancelled; 'Domino effect' at BC Children's Hospital pulling resources away from other areas</b>
</div><div>Larry Pynn   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>586 words</div><div>27 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Elective surgeries at BC Children's Hospital are at risk of being cancelled as more resources are devoted to the H1N1 virus, the hospital's head of pediatric general surgery said Monday.</p>
<p>Dr. Erik Skarsgard said the hospital's emergency department is experiencing such an increase in influenza-like illness (ILI) cases it has set up an ILI clinic, which has displaced the general pediatric clinic.</p>
<p>"The domino effect of increased ILI cases on other services in a fixed capacity system is inevitable," Skarsgard said. "As more resources are needed to care for the ILI population, our ability to provide business-as-usual care to the rest of our patients is compromised.</p>
<p>"Based on the experience of other health care jurisdictions, we are prepared for an ILI surge that would block our hospital beds -- and especially our intensive-care unit beds -- with H1N1 children, effectively shutting down elective surgery in our operating rooms, as our recovery room will become an overflow area for ventilated H1N1 patients."</p>
<p>Skarsgard urged British Columbians to get their H1N1 shots.</p>
<p>The virus is "extremely communicable and children appear to be high viral shedders," he said, noting it has the "potential to cause respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support in an ICU in previously healthy young people, including pregnant women."</p>
<p>He added: "I will get a flu [seasonal and H1N1] shot. I am at a higher risk for infection than some, but I get the shot as much for the families and children that I treat, as for myself."</p>
<p>Marisa Nichini, director of communications for the hospital, said 50 to 60 patients per day are attending the emergency department, most with mild to moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.</p>
<p>She said that's "higher than usual" for this time of the year, more comparable with the peak of a normal flu season. But it was too early to determine a trend.</p>
<p>No elective operations have yet been cancelled.</p>
<p>Nichini encouraged families whose otherwise healthy children have mild to moderate influenza-like symptoms to call their family doctors, or HealthLink 811 and ask to speak with a nurse, leaving hospital emergency visits for seriously ill children.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) kicked off its H1N1 vaccination clinics Monday, giving free shots to priority high-risk groups, including people under 65 with chronic health issues, pregnant women, and people who live in remote or isolated communities, including first nations.</p>
<p>VCH spokesman Gavin Wilson said health centres such as Arbutus and Three Bridges in Vancouver experienced lineups and waits, evidence of a pent-up demand for the vaccine. More than 30,000 doses were distributed to physicians for use in their offices.</p>
<p>Public health nurses began vaccinating at two community health clinics as well as at shelters in the Downtown Eastside. "It's a high-risk population," Wilson confirmed.</p>
<p>Phase two of the program starts next Monday, when the H1N1 flu shot will be available to children six months to five years of age, people who work in health care, and people who are in contact at home or through home care services with infants and those who have compromised immune systems. Phase three starts in mid-November for all others.</p>

<p>-For weeks, the NDP and Liberals have said the Conservatives are giving the stimulus funds to Tory ridings, but an analysis by Canwest News shows the NDP and Liberals, which hold 12 per cent and 25 per cent of the ridings respectively, actually received 25 per cent and 35 per cent of the money.

<p>- Canada's chief public health officer says it is our "civic duty" to get the H1N1 flu shot. In that case, probably fewer than a quarter of us will actually get it. Given the voter turnout at elections, that is our customary attitude to civic duty.</p>
<p>-If medical authorities want us to line up for H1N1 immunization, they should cough up some hard data backing their claims as to the severity of this pandemic. Simply crying "the sky is falling" no longer cuts it with a public that's been thoroughly desensitized by years of media hype.</p>

<p>Since Canadians are divided on whether to receive the H1N1 vaccine, why don't we start a study to compare the outcomes, including the flu and side effects, between those who are vaccinated and those who are not.</p>
<p>Government and the drug industry have lacked transparency on this issue to the point where their claims are no longer trusted many Canadians.</p>
<p>While the flu is still benign, let's study ourselves. Perhaps government and corporate claims will be borne out. That could be good news for future influenza threats.</p>
<p>Warning Canadians that their failure to be vaccinated may threaten the lives of others is not helpful. Canadians don't need to be bullied;we need evidence and reasoned discussion.</p>
<p>If there is some validity to the claims behind flu vaccination, let's see them openly studied. Make the study results public so that everyone can be kept apprised. Leave no opportunity for "cooking the results" to suit government and industry's positions.</p>

<p>Judging by the headlines, many people in Canada won't take the H1N1 vaccine now that it's available.</p>
<p>It's just the opposite in the developing world. Canada is reassessing its international immunization initiative, which saves about half a million of the poorest lives each year, with no plans to extend it.</p>
<p>Imagine the outcry in our own country if the H1N1 vaccine was now withheld. The international immunization initiative should be immediately extended and, indeed, expanded.</p>

<p>Re: "Skepticism greets flu vaccine; Nearly half of Canadians won't get H1N1 shot: poll," The Journal, Oct. 24.</p>
<p>Health Canada has been trying to impress upon Canadians the need to get H1N1 flu vaccinations, and prioritizing the vaccination of children, pregnant women, and the elderly.</p>
<p>This emphasis is contrary to the conclusions of two research papers published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Mexican and Canadian sensitivities to and lethality of H1N1, and the latest studies by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control (CDC).</p>
<p>In the Mexican study, 6.9 per cent of those who became critically ill were younger than 20 years old, whereas 78 per cent were between 20 and 60 years old. Of those who died, 4.2 per cent were younger than 20 years and 92 per cent were adults aged 20 to 60.</p>
<p>Of those who became critically ill or died, 53 per cent were women. The vast majority--84.5 per cent --of those who became critically ill or died from H1N1 were people who suffered from at least one other serious health problem, such as obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, or had a history of smoking.</p>
<p>In the Canadian study, the average age of critically ill people was 32.3 years. Sixty-seven per cent of those with confirmed or probable H1N1, and 72 per cent of those who died, were women. Fully 96 per cent of those who became critically ill suffered from at least one other medical problem, the most common being obesity, high blood pressure, chronic lung disease like asthma, and a history of smoking or diabetes.</p>
<p>According to the CDC, 45 per cent of the 4,958 people hospitalized with H1N1 between Aug. 30 and Oct. 10 were younger than 18 years old, and 48 per cent were between 19 and 64. However, of 292 people who died, the majority (71 per cent) were between 19 and 64 years old, versus 17 per cent who were younger than 18.</p>
<p>The groups that suffered the highest proportional death rates were those aged 50 to 64 (32 per cent) and those aged 19 to 24 (nine per cent).</p>
<p>The CDC said, "At this time, there are relatively fewer cases and deaths reported in people 65 years and older, which is unusual when compared with seasonal flu."</p>
<p>There is no evidence of higher risks for pregnant women in recent H1N1 studies, but prudence suggests it may present a serious risk to pregnant women.</p>
<p>While the governments' vaccination priorities and messaging is consistent with typical flu risks, every indication is that H1N1 is killing far fewer people than "normal" strains of influenza: so far, 2,800 people have died worldwide from H1N1, versus 500,000 each year from the flu.</p>
<p>Medical studies in Canada, Mexico and the U.S. suggest that children may be more likely than other age groups to get sick from H1N1, but are less likely to die from it than adults. Despite the bad optics, an appropriate emphasis for early vaccination programs in Canada might be on adults between 20 and 65, and especially those who are obese, have a history of smoking, or suffer from chronic lung conditions, high blood pressure or diabetes. Prudence suggests pregnant women also should be included.</p>
<p>However, focusing on children and the elderly is likely more political than anything else, perhaps because telling parents to worry more about themselves than their children simply doesn't play well.</p>

</div><div>Graham Thomson   </div>

<div>931 words</div><div>27 October 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>If you want to know what's going on in Alberta politics, don't look inside the legislative assembly.</p>
<p>The fall sitting may have started on Monday with 83 MLAs duly taking their seats and with reporters following them around the legislature like seagulls after a fishing trawler--but the Alberta legislative assembly is devoid of things politically interesting or significant.</p>
<p>All the action is taking place outside: Lineups for swine flu; rallies against Bill 50; the growth of the Wildrose Alliance; Conservatives plotting against Premier Ed Stelmach for his upcoming leadership review.</p>
<p>If it's relevant, controversial or important, odds are it's happening somewhere other than inside the assembly.</p>
<p>It's almost as if the Conservatives don't know what to do with the assembly. Wait a minute--it's exactly like the Conservatives don't know what to do with the legislative assembly.</p>
<p>After years of neglect and abuse by the Conservatives, the legislative assembly has been reduced to playing a bit part in our political theatre.</p>
<p>That, of course, is not the way it's supposed to be. The assembly should be the gravitational centre of politics where the government is held to account.</p>
<p>Instead, after 38 years in power, the Conservatives have turned the legislative assembly into something to be endured, not embraced.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach has made some changes to the system that give the impression he wants the assembly to be taken more seriously. He has, for example, set out firm starting dates for the spring and fall sittings, something Ralph Klein never did. Infamously, Klein did his best to avoid the assembly, dismissing those who took seriously legislative debate as suffering from "Dome disease."</p>
<p>Under Klein, the important decisions occurred behind closed doors in caucus and cabinet.</p>
<p>Thus we progressed from a democracy to a Kleinocracy. Nothing has really changed under Stelmach. Decisions on issues such as health care, cabinet salaries and cuts to education are done with little to no public say or debate. It is a mockery of democracy. Call it a mockracy.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that the two biggest players in the assembly--Stelmach and Liberal Leader David Swann-- are charismatically challenged and couldn't generate political heat if you soaked them in gasoline and shot them out of a cannon. They are both decent, intelligent men who are earnestly trying to do a job, but watching them debate in question period is like watching two kittens in a pillow fight.</p>
<p>Then you have the pit bull that is Health Minister Ron Liepert, who barks his way through question period.</p>
<p>When NDP MLA Rachel Notley asked Liepert about closed-door decisions to shut down long-term care beds, he shot back with a nasty, off-topic, partisan attack: "My guess is that the people that that member (Notley) was talking to probably belong to a public-sector union or the so-called enemies of medicare or one of these groups that is just part of their little organization out there, Mr. Speaker. I hardly doubt that that member even bothered to venture in to visit with seniors in a particular facility."</p>
<p>Actually, Notley spent part of October on a tour of the province listening to Albertans' concerns about health care.</p>
<p>Liepert is like a kid with a slingshot who sees the opposition as a pane of glass. He can't resist throwing stones. In the end, though, his bad-tempered answers make him look defensive and secretive--and lend credibility to complaints from critics who fear the government's ill-defined health-care reforms will harm the system.</p>
<p>That's not to say nothing of import happened on Monday.</p>
<p>Two MLAs entered the assembly and took their seats in the Outer Siberia of Alberta politics, in the far corner, as far from the speaker's chair as you can get without actually leaving the chambers. Both are recycled MLAs--one a shadow from the government's past, one possibly a foreshadowing of the government's future. Former cabinet minister Guy Boutilier, booted from government caucus by Stelmach in July and reincarnated as an Independent, is sitting next to Paul Hinman, the former Alberta Alliance MLA who won the recent Calgary-Glenmore byelection and has been returned to politics as the province's only Wildrose Alliance member.</p>
<p>Years ago we had the "Deep Six," a group of right-wing Conservative members who liked to rattle their own party's cage. Now, in Boutilier and Hinman, we have the Terrible Twos.</p>
<p>They might sit next to each other, but Boutilier is not saying whether he'll eventually join the Wildrose. Instead, he's making rumblings about showing up as a delegate to the Conservatives's annual convention next month where they're to hold a mandatory review of Stelmach's leadership. Boutilier won't say how he'll vote, but it's a safe bet he won't be writing Stelmach any Christmas cards from the ballot booth.</p>
<p>Hinman seems to be of two minds about being back. He's happy to have won the byelection, but says what goes on in the legislature is "just a lot of lip-flapping." His party's attention is on newly elected leader Danielle Smith--who doesn't have a legislative seat--touring the province to raise the party's profile.</p>
<p>In other words, just about anything interesting in Alberta politics is happening everyplace except the legislative assembly.</p>

<p>The City of Edmonton doesn't have access to the H1N1 flu vaccine, but started providing seasonal flu shots to workers who want them around the beginning of October, employee safety and wellness director David Doyle said.</p>
<p>There has been slightly higher interest this fall in the annual program, which over almost two months sees two occupational health nurses go to various work sites and give shots to about 3,000 of the city's 10,000 full-time and temporary staff, Doyle said.</p>
<p>The city is encouraging people to get an H1N1 shot but there aren't currently any plans to provide time off to attend a clinic, although workers can arrange with their supervisors to take time for medical appointments, he said.</p>

</p>
<p>On Day 1 of the largest mass-vaccination program in history, thousands of at-risk Canadians waited patiently in long queues Monday, to be among the first to receive the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>Lines containing hundreds of people snaked through shopping malls, local arenas and community centres, as mothers and fathers pushing strollers, seniors, pregnant women, and other Canadians believed to be most at risk of serious flu complications lined up before clinics opened.</p>
<p>An Ottawa clinic had to turn away prospective patients after it became clear by mid-afternoon that the wait time was about four hours, and nurses would not be able to immunize everyone by closing time.</p>
<p>"I've been in a high-risk category for several years now, and I've been told if I get pneumonia one more time, it could be my last," said Bruce Chute, as he waited at a clinic in the Ottawa suburb of Kanata.</p>
<p>In Calgary, people began lining up before dawn for their shots at all four of the city's clinics, with as many as 800 people crowded outside one shopping-mall venue when the doors opened. Similar scenes played out in Victoria.</p>
<p>Montrealers, however, were left in limbo as health-department officials scrambled to distribute 155,000 doses of the vaccine that were delivered to the city over the weekend. That means workers at most Montreal hospitals, who were expected to start receiving their shots Monday, will not get their jabs until next week.</p>
<p>Most provinces are first vaccinating Canadians who are believed to be most at risk of developing flu-related complications, such as those with chronic medical conditions, children between the ages of six months and five years, pregnant woman and health-care workers. The general public is being asked to hold off on going for their shots until priority groups have received theirs.</p>
<p>Canada, meanwhile, is spending more than $2 million to buy H1N1 vaccine from Australia, so that pregnant woman can get their recommended shot "on a timely basis," the federal government announced Monday.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said she signed a special order to allow for the purchase of 200,000 doses of the unadjuvanted version of the vaccine from an Australian manufacturer called CSL.</p>
<p>Canada is awaiting the production and approval of 1.8 million doses from its own manufacturer, Glaxo-SmithKline. The vaccine offered to most Canadians contains an adjuvant, a substance added to the vaccine to make it more effective. There are no clinical data on flu vaccines with adjuvants in pregnant women, so the government ordered a different version for them as a precaution, although it maintains both versions are safe for pregnant women.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said the additional supply of unadjuvanted vaccine was secured because of the rising rates of H1N1 cases in Canada.</p>
<p>The price tag for the order is $2,550,000.</p>
<p>The Australian vaccine will be distributed to all provinces and territories, and is scheduled to arrive the first week of November, barring any delivery problems. With files from the Calgary Herald, Ottawa Citizen and Montreal Gazette</p>

<p>One of Premier Ed Stelmach's former leadership rivals warned PC party members Monday that it would be risky for them to force a leadership race at their upcoming convention.</p>
<p>"It would be a big mistake for our party not to take seriously our loss in Calgary-Glenmore and the Wildrose party," Sustainable Resource Development Minister Ted Morton said.</p>
<p>"But it would be a bigger mistake to plunge the party into a leadership review at this time.</p>
<p>"So I'm encouraging my constituents and all PCs to vote against a leadership (race) on Nov. 7."</p>
<p>Morton's comments kicked off the fall session of the legislature, which saw the opposition raise questions about power-line legislation, health care and flu vaccines.</p>
<p>-Legislature isn't where it's happening: Thomson / A12</p>
<p>Morton is the second former leadership rival to deliver such a message this week, a possible sign that party members are rallying around their embattled leader.</p>
<p>On the weekend, former provincial treasurer Jim Dinning told the Calgary Herald the government should be focusing on important issues, not internal party machinations.</p>
<p>"To give Ed Stelmach a mortal blow would be a major mistake, a huge mistake for the party I've been a member of since 1972, when I was a kid," Dinning said. "It would give Alberta a serious black eye when we have to deal with our finances in the short term, environment and energy in the long term, and health care until kingdom come."</p>
<p>Dinning and Morton were the front-runners to replace Ralph Klein as party leader, but lost to Stelmach in December 2006 on the second ballot.</p>
<p>Stelmach went on to lead his party to a massive majority in the last election. But in recent months he has run into political trouble, including a byelection loss, falling popularity in the polls and rumours of defections to the upstart Wildrose Alliance party.</p>
<p>The premier faces a mandatory leadership review at the party's annual meeting on Nov. 7 and some have suggested he will do poorly.</p>
<p>In the first question period of the fall session of the legislature, opposition parties prodded Stelmach, questioning his leadership on health care, including H1N1 vaccines, and about Bill 50, the controversial power-line legislation.</p>
<p>NDP Leader Brian Mason went after the government's health reforms. He cited poll numbers showing the premier's popularity falling.</p>
<p>"When will the premier admit he's chosen the wrong direction for Alberta and start listening to the people who put him where he is?" Mason asked.</p>
<p>Liberal MLA Dave Taylor suggested upcoming hearings on Bill 50, which would streamline the process for approving power lines, are political cover for Stelmach's leadership review.</p>
<p>Stelmach called the idea "misinformation."</p>
<p>"I can tell you I'm not backing away from the principles that got me here, no matter what the threat from the opposition" he said.</p>
<p>Stelmach met later in the day with U.S. Ambassador David Jacobson to discuss trade and energy issues.</p>
<p>Outside the legislature, new Wildrose Alliance Party Leader Danielle Smith announced her tour of Alberta this week, with stops in Edmonton, Grimshaw, Valleyview, Grande Prairie and Slave Lake.</p>

</p>
<p>Ultimate Fighting Championship heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar has pulled out of his UFC 106 title match with challenger Shane Carwin due to illness.</p>
<p>Lesnar (4-1) has been sick for nearly a month and unable to train, forcing him to postpone the title defence which was scheduled to take place Nov. 21.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Yahoo! </span>Sports was the first to report the story. UFC confirmed the report on its website.</p>
<p>"(Lesnar) said he's never been this sick in his life," UFC president Dana White told <span class="companylink">Yahoo! </span>Sports.</p>
<p>"He said it's been going on for a long time and he just hasn't been able to shake it."</p>
<p>White said he did not think Lesnar had the H1N1 flu, but Carwin (11-0) on his Twitter account, wrote Monday that it "looks like it is postponed till Jan 2. I had H1NI myself and I understand how devastating it can be."</p>
<p>UFC 108 takes place Jan. 2 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The current main event pits Rashad Evans versus Thiago Silva. Anderson Silva, if healthy, might also be on the card, defending his middleweight title against Vitor Belfort.</p>
<p>Carwin told <span class="companylink">Yahoo! </span>Sports his "heart just sank, as you can imagine," when he heard the news about Lesnar.</p>

<p>For the sixth consecutive month, MLS residential sales in Calgary have increased from year-ago levels in both the single-family home and condominium markets--another sign the local real estate market has rebounded from its malaise earlier in the year. The housing market today is far more positive than it was last October, said Kathleen LaPlante, a realtor with Re/Max Realty Professionals.</p>

</p>
<p>F itness facilities are adding more sanitizers and increasing education in an effort to combat the spread of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Most gyms already have measures in place, with antiseptic sprays and clean towels for wiping down equipment, in addition to hand sanitizers around their facilities.</p>
<p>But some have boosted safety measures and are also emphasizing education to help keep the so-called swine flu at bay.</p>
<p>"Of course, there's going to be an elevated risk when you're out in the public, whether it's a gym or hospital or schools," said Ray Love, owner of Fitness Plus. "People don't want to start locking themselves in their houses because they're scared of the flu."</p>
<p>Still, he said, staff put up extra hand-cleaning stations in August as an additional precaution directly in response to the threat of H1N1.</p>
<p>"You want to do the best for your members. Some people are very concerned about it and you want to meet their needs," he said.</p>
<p>At the YMCA of Calgary facilities, staff are taking a two-pronged approach by increasing the number of hand-sanitizer stations--particularly in high-traffic locations, such as lobbies -- but also using posters to remind people about healthy habits.</p>
<p>Posters outlining proper handwashing techniques, reminders to cough into your arm and information about nutrition and staying home when ill have also gone up.</p>
<p>"We're encouraging healthy habits," said Emily Triggs, the organization's health and safety manager.</p>
<p>On the weight floors, disinfectant towelettes are on hand for patrons to wipe down equipment, and staff also go out regularly to clean the machines, she noted.</p>
<p>Talisman Centre has always had measures in place for fighting the spread of illness, but efforts have been increased in the wake of the H1N1 spread.</p>
<p>Human resources manager Jennifer Ireland said signs are up and information is on their website emphasizing that people should stay away if they are sick or showing symptoms. The posters also encourage people to wash their hands and clean equipment before and after use.</p>
<p>"We're just making sure we're taking as many proactive measures as possible," she said.</p>

</p>
<p>So Alberta Health Services has organized four H1N1 vaccination clinics in Calgary and clearly states that "at risk" people should be the first to get the shot, though they are not making any special arrangements for them in terms of priority. This means that many swollen and fatigued pregnant women as well as the elderly will have to endure potentially long lines. It doesn't seem quite fair does it? But let's not forget about our doctors, who will be needed on the front lines more than ever this flu season. It's somewhat unbelievable that there has been no special arrangements made for them or their families, who in terms of direct exposure are among those most at risk. This seems perhaps the most shortsighted of all, in terms of logistics.</p>
<p>If your doctor is unavailable in the near future, you might find him or her standing in line at one of the clinics, taking precious time away from their practices to get the H1N1 shot. Or maybe they just phoned in sick.</p>

<p>Re: "Flu shot clinics open today," Oct. 26.</p>
<p>Canadians and Albertans have heard too many versions when it comes to the H1N1 flu shot. If Alberta Health & Wellness is so concerned about people getting their H1N1 shot, PLEASE make it more convenient to have the vaccination. Calgary has about one million people, but ONLY four places to get the flu shot.</p>

<p>It's interesting to take note that most of the reasons that people have for not getting the H1N1 vaccination are selfish ones: I'm not at risk. I haven't had the flu in years. It's not that big a deal to me. The media is blowing everything out of proportion.</p>
<p>While I am an advocate of personal choice, I wonder if these people have thought for a moment about the ramifications their "personal choice" has on the rest of the population. Most people infected with H1N1 do not present symptoms, so of course it wouldn't be a big deal for you. But what about the person next to you on the bus? Or the child next to your child in the day-care centre? You have no idea what health problems they are faced with. Vaccinations work best when everyone gets them. As a carrier, you may not present symptoms or have any issues at all. But look around you at the rest of the population. Are you willing to risk their lives as well? Last I checked, that shouldn't be your call to make.</p>

<div>For The Calgary Herald</div>
<div>721 words</div><div>27 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>It should strike us as very telling that many of those complaining of unnecessary and unjustified fears over H1N1 flu are the same ones spreading unnecessary and unjustified fears over the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>The blatant hypocrisy of engaging in one form of hysteria while denouncing another belies a deeper agenda: vaccine denial.</p>
<p>The scope and severity of H1N1 may indeed have been overblown to some extent, although we've not yet really seen what this new virus is capable of. Fortunately, thanks to science and medicine, we need not witness its full potential.</p>
<p>Also, some of the alarmist rhetoric and sensationalist reporting has fostered a high level of public cynicism-- an atmosphere which has provided fertile ground for the anti-vaccine movement.</p>
<p>On top of that, there's the perception that this flu is, for the most part, unpleasant but not the end of the world. Most H1N1 cases have been relatively mild, so it may seem more of an inconvenience for people to get a shot: apathy as opposed to fear. When you couple that with the ramping up of antivaccine rhetoric, though, it's little surprise that some polls show a majority of Canadians saying they will not get vaccinated.</p>
<p>But even if you are at worst going to contract a minor case of H1N1 flu, what if you then pass it on to someone at much greater risk of complications? Moreover, H1N1 seems to pose more risk to healthy young women and men than does seasonal flu. Reducing the total number of cases of H1N1 flu is achievable and desirable--what's the upside of mass vaccine refusal?</p>
<p>There's some understandable concern among</p>
<p>Canada's medical establishment, which is why Canada's chief public health officer has gone out of his way to counter the myths and make sure we're all aware of the facts.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones is saying what the vast majority of top medical experts are saying: the H1N1 vaccine is safe and effective. The benefits of getting it far outweigh the risk of refusing it.</p>
<p>Flu vaccines are not perfect, but their efficacy and safety have been demonstrated over and over again in the peer-reviewed medical research. Yet that matters little to the true believers of the anti-vaccine movement who routinely denounce even our most proven and effective vaccines.</p>
<p>It is one of those curious strains of conspiracy theory which straddles the political fringes and brings people under a common umbrella who might be there for totally different reasons.</p>
<p>To those more or less pegged on the political left, the sinister villain in their eyes is Big Pharma. In this narrative, Big Pharma is diabolically concocting and distributing dangerous toxins-- and then laughing all the way to the bank.</p>
<p>It would seem self-evident that developing ineffective and dangerous vaccines is bad for business, but we ought not expect to encounter much logic in these outer reaches.</p>
<p>To those more or less pegged on the political right or libertarian fringes, the main villain here is not Big Pharma (although they've partly bought into that caricature), but rather the government--ordering up and administering these hazardous vaccines to the unsuspecting sheeple.</p>
<p>Mind you, the motive for this villain is much more murky: the government is forcing us to put ourselves at risk because, well, they can.</p>
<p>That's not to say that corporations have not cut corners in pursuit of profit or that governments at all levels have not taken an unhealthy interest in all aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>None of that, however, amounts to anything approaching an argument against this or any other vaccine. All the anti-government and anti-corporate rhetoric in the world is no substitute for scientific evidence.</p>
<p>In this respect, the antivaccine movement comes to resemble creationists: with no science or evidence to bolster their argument, they run around trying to poke holes in the mountain of evidence bolstering the case of that for which they are in denial.</p>
<p>Mind you, creationism never gave anyone the flu, measles, or polio.</p>
<p>Fear the quacks. Fear the conspiracy theories. Fear not the flu shot.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Morton joins Stelmach backers as review nears; Minister says Wildrose can't be ignored</b>
</div><div>Renata D'Aliesio   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald; with files from the Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>832 words</div><div>27 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Sustainable Resource Development Minister Ted Morton, one of the premier's main rivals for PC party chief in 2006, said Monday it would be a mistake for Tories to turf Ed Stelmach in the upcoming vote on his leadership.</p>
<p>Morton's public endorsement of Stelmach comes a day after the premier's other chief leadership contender--former Conservative treasurer Jim Dinning--pledged strong support for the Tory boss.</p>
<p>Stelmach, whose authority has faced increased scrutiny due to sagging support in public opinion polls and last month's Conservative loss in the Calgary-Glenmore byelection, called the endorsements "positive," but stressed his focus is on the economy as politicians of all stripes returned to the legislature Monday for the fall session.</p>
<p>The premier's leadership test is slated for Nov. 7 at a PC party convention in Red Deer.</p>
<p>While Morton voiced support for Stelmach on Monday, he also delivered words of caution, saying it would be unwise for the long-ruling Conservatives to dismiss the Wildrose Alliance's byelection victory as a one-off.</p>
<p>"I've told caucus that I think it would be a big mistake to ignore what happened in Calgary-Glenmore with the Wildrose," said Morton, MLA for the Foothills-Rocky View riding near Calgary.</p>
<p>"But I've also told friends and members of my(constituency) that it would be a bigger mistake to plunge the party into a leadership review at this point in time."</p>
<p>Morton suggests the Tories must re-examine some of its policies to "win back those wavering conservatives" who are eyeing other parties. He cited the province's oilpatch competitiveness review and sustainable government spending as two key priorities.</p>
<p>"It's a time to do policy, not argue about leadership," Morton said. "We have to make sure that we are a competitive place to invest and do business, particularly in the oil and gas business."</p>
<p>Morton said his decision to back Stelmach was an easy one.</p>
<p>"I've been through this stuff before federally," he said, "and you don't refight leadership races after they're over. When they're over, they're over."</p>
<p>Public pledges of support from Morton and Dinning-- who on Sunday said ousting Stelmach would be a "major mistake" for the party and a "serious black eye" for Alberta --arrive at a pivotal time for the premier, observes University of Calgary political analyst David Taras.</p>
<p>He said their endorsements signal that two likely heirs apparent aren't interested in challenging Stelmach for the Tory leadership.</p>
<p>"The absence of a rival is very significant," he said. "The fact that no top-name person is breaking ranks means that it's more difficult for others to break ranks."</p>
<p>A Tory who was booted from caucus in July after breaking ranks with the Conservative government on the issue of nursing homes returnedtothe legislature Monday.</p>
<p>Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo MLA Guy Boutilier, who now sits as an Independent and plans to vote at Stelmach's PC leadership review next month, said he remains rankled by the premier's "unilateral" decision to evict him from caucus.</p>
<p>Boutilier, a former cabinet minister, gets to ask his first question of the government Thursday. He said he plans to press the Conservatives on seniors and health care.</p>
<p>Another MLA who marked his return to the legislature Monday is the Wildrose Alliance's Paul Hinman, who won last month's Calgary-Glenmore byelection, giving the fledgling party its only riding. Hinman served as MLA for Cardston-Taber-Warner from 2004 to 2008.</p>
<p>"The people of Calgary-Glenmore, when I spoke to them at the door, were very upset with the direction in the way this government was behaving," Hinman said, noting concerns such as the province's projected $6.9-billion deficit and new centralized health board.</p>
<p>The first day of the fall legislative session served as a harbinger of flashpoints between the Conservatives and opposition parties. The Liberals and NDP challenged the government's handling of H1N1 vaccine clinics, hospital cuts and a contentious bill that proposes to fast-track the construction of new power lines.</p>
<p>Also at the legislature was the new U.S. ambassador to Canada, David Jacobson. Along with meeting with the premier, Jacobson sat down on Monday with the Pembina Institute, an Alberta-based environmental think-tank.</p>
<p>Oilsands and climate change were the main topics of discussion. Jacobson told reporters he's still learning about Alberta's energy development and hasn't finalized the message he'll take to Washington.</p>
<p>"This is a very, very important issue to my country," he said. "We believe that Canada is a pillar in the energy security of the United States."</p>

<p>Every notion, no matter how wacky, has its share of true believers.</p>
<p>About 12 per cent think the upcoming blank on the Mayan calendar signals the end of days in 2012. Some nine per cent believe aliens hide in comet tails waiting to beam to Earth during close orbits. There's even 15 per cent support for the federal Liberals in Alberta. Go figure.</p>
<p>But when two major newspaper polls find half of all Canadians will refuse to get the swine flu vaccine, believing the million-to-one risk of serious side effects outweighs the one-in-four odds of getting whacked with H1N1, it screams for a shot of common sense.</p>
<p>All credible medical opinion declares this vaccine a potential lifesaver as it rolls out a week ahead of schedule across the country. Yet, inexplicably, even as the bug starts to bite hard during a spreading fall pandemic, public support for taking the simplest dose of precaution has taken a dramatic slide.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer, David Butler-Jones, actually elevated his voice Monday above its usual monotone to insist immunization for everyone is a must, if not for the good of the individual's health, then for the vulnerable population at large who could pick up the contagious bug from vaccineavoiders.</p>
<p>The naysayers are led by the likes of Dr. Andrew Moulden, former leader of the barely alive Canadian Action Party and now linked to the even-less-so Christian Heritage party, who is touring Alberta charging $25 per gullible person to spread his fear-mongering as an anti-vaccinationist.</p>
<p>Every parent who believes Moulden's nonsense --at one point, he blamed a bad vaccine reaction for autism in kids--should note the case of a seemingly healthy young girl from Cornwall, Ont., who came down with the flu and shortness of breath last Friday and was dead by Sunday, diagnosed as the region's second H1N1 fall fatality.</p>
<p>This reflects the flu's most insidious impact. It does not strike the infirm or elderly the hardest. It cuts down those in the prime of their life with horrific speed.</p>
<p>Yet, incredibly, even some MPs are skeptical, including New Democrat Niki Ashton, who should know better. She is quoted in the Hill Times newspaper as merely "leaning towards getting it," despite coming from an high-risk aboriginal community in northern Manitoba already hit by 891 cases of the flu and seven deaths.</p>
<p>If she's queasy about the vaccine knowing the deadly speed with which it hit her own community, one can only imagine how passively it will be viewed by residents in Newfoundland, who will likely be among the last affected by the rippling-out pandemic.</p>
<p>It's time for this government, which is so proficient at stimulating its electoral fortunes by advertising with tax dollars, to deliver swine flu shock therapy.</p>
<p>Few Canadians watch those low-key, reassuring mid-afternoon news conferences by Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and her public health sidekicks.</p>
<p>Something scary in content and delivered with the saturation coverage of those Conservative attack ads on Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff or the commercial overkill of the government's economic action plan is needed to jolt the skepticism out of the general population.</p>
<p>After all, every person who refuses a vaccine shot could end up hooked to a rare hospital respirator or ventilator a week later, filling an intensive care bed that's needed for someone without a vaccine-preventable condition.</p>
<p>If they come down with mild flu symptoms, they could wander the workplace and social haunts passively infecting Canadian who have not yet been immunized or had time for the vaccine to take.</p>
<p>While the vaccine manufacturer and the government of Canada deserve credit for getting the immunization rolling quickly and, despite the lineups, fairly efficiently, public apathy has to be overcome.</p>
<p>The prime minister didn't do federal health officials any favours by waffling on the vaccine, saying only "we haven't actually made a final decision." Good grief. Stephen Harper should be dragged away from piano practice to have his entire family vaccinated in a photo op that actually does more than improve his political optics.</p>
<p>With the United States declaring a state of emergency in the scramble to find enough vaccine to meet the demand, low support for the immunization could mean a supply glut even as hospitals and clinics are over-run with gasping swine flu victims.</p>
<p>An injection of harsh reality is needed to boost support for a vaccine that could save lives now--even among those who believe human life on Earth will end in 2012.</p>

</div><div>James Gordon   </div>

</p>
<p>The Ottawa Senators devoted almost an entire practice to special teams play on Monday, but there was no mistaking which unit the session was aimed at.</p>
<p>While the Senators are the owners of the NHL's top penalty kill (89.7-per-cent success rate and four shorthanded goals), the 29th-ranked power play remains about as scary as a puppy in a Halloween costume.</p>
<p>After Ottawa once again failed to find the back of the net with three opportunities in Saturday's 4-3 shootout loss to Boston, coach Cory Clouston zeroed in on the PP and added a familiar wrinkle by putting Daniel Alfredsson on the point.</p>
<p>The real key to success may be more personnel than play, however. Defenceman and power-play quarterback Filip Kuba also skated in his first full practice after missing the past eight games with a nagging lower-body injury. Clouston said if Kuba makes it through another session today, the big puck-mover should be in the lineup Wednesday against Florida.</p>
<p>"I think he'll make a big (power-play) improvement as far as just poise, confidence and experience back there," Clouston said. "He doesn't have a booming shot, but he's able to get the shots through, for the most part. He's very intelligent, as far as reading (the play)."</p>
<p>The booming shot is where Alfredsson comes in.</p>
<p>"Right now, we don't have a shot threat," Clouston said, noting each difficult game causes his point men to play a little tenser. "When they do have an opportunity, they duff shots, they miss nets."</p>
<p>"It'll turn around, but right now Alfie has some experience on the back end. He does have a very good shot back there," the coach said. "Hopefully, if he does, it'll open up some other things. Right now, teams aren't too threatened by our point shots, and we have to change that."</p>
<p>Alfredsson hopes he can make a difference.</p>
<p>"We need to get something going, and I think it could be a good change for us," he said. "I think we were struggling, we got a little bit better and then the last game was just not good at all for us."</p>
<p>For his part, Kuba wasn't promising any miracles.</p>
<p>"I don't think it's about one guy playing on the power play," he said. "It's the whole unit, (but) obviously I want to play hockey. It's tough sitting in the stands."</p>
<p>Kuba's return presents some quandaries on defence. First and foremost, the Senators need to figure out what to do with rookie Erik Karlsson.</p>
<p>He missed practice with the flu, but if he plays Wednesday it'll mark his 10th NHL game this season.</p>
<p>That milestone starts the clock ticking on his eligibility for unrestricted free agency, whereas the Senators would save a year if he headed off to play in Binghamton or Sweden. He has three assists in nine games and is a minus-four.</p>
<p>Clouston acknowledged the diminutive defenceman needs to add size and strength, and improve his intensity, but also praised his offensive ability.</p>
<p>"We're going to have to make a decision, obviously, in the next 24 to 48 hours," Clouston said. "There are some pros and cons (for keeping him). It's going to be a tough decision either way and, again, we've got to make a decision for what's best for him in the long run and what's best for us immediately."</p>
<p>FLU BUGS SENS</p>
<p>Centre Peter Regin also missed practice with flu-like symptoms after a handful of other players reported feeling ill over the weekend. Fortunately for the Senators, everyone appears to be recovering within 24 hours.</p>
<p>With all the hoopla over H1N1, Clouston was asked if the team was taking any extra flu precautions. He said the team was handling it like any other sickness.</p>
<p>"We're trying to wash our hands as much as we possibly can," he said. "We're trying to have each guy to have their own water bottle, (that) type of thing, but, to be honest, we try and do that any time."</p>

</p>
<p>The City of Ottawa's reputation is in tatters now. It wasn't always that way. In 2001 when the area's municipalities joined with amalgamation, city hall was alive with hope.</p>
<p>The planning department, with the problems of combining all the previous urban administrations, jumped into developing a new official plan that emphasized new urbanism. Such was the devotion of the good public servants that, in the midst of bureaucratic chaos, they could undertake such an enormous, successful endeavour.</p>
<p>The optimism on Laurier Avenue did not go unnoticed on Parliament Hill and environs. Federal public servants, who previously wouldn't have given a sniff to working for the municipality, started shuffling down Elgin Street to city hall because it was perceived to be the level of government where the action was.</p>
<p>That view had been predated by the 1998 ice storm. City hall was the epicentre of the response to the crisis. That's where the news conferences were held that kept Ottawans in tune with the latest developments in the storm and its relief. The emergency centre operated out of there because the city had the hydro, police, fire, ambulance, transit and civic workers who were helping to get Ottawa and, later, eastern Ontario back running again. It was the City of Ottawa's finest hour, but not that of the senior levels of government; the former <span class="companylink">Ontario Hydro</span> was late and incompetent in its response while the federal government was just lost and irrelevant.</p>
<p>The city performed admirably throughout the 2003 blackout, doing all the right things while the federal government looked, once again, baffled. Meanwhile, the municipality was designing a cutting-edge light-rail plan that would not only move people quickly and cleanly but also was to move developers to design many residential dwellings and businesses around it -- transportation as a planning tool. Then the wheels started to come off the wagon, or rather the train off the tracks. The cancellation of light rail caused a number of key Ottawa public servants, who had gravitated to the sexy project, to quit in disgust. Now the city, with its new rail plan, is bereft of expertise. How the mighty have fallen.</p>
<p>That's just the beginning. There was the $100-million cost of the rail cancellation; the pouring of millions of litres of sewage into the Ottawa River; a dead, empty $20-million Ottawa Stadium on Coventry Road; promises of fiscal conservatism running into the reality of escalating municipal costs; an abysmal response to the massive sewage backup in Glen Cairn subdivision; and an epidemic of waffling among the city's leaders.</p>
<p>Now the city has an opportunity to redeem itself. The H1N1 flu issue brings the city back to what it does best -- or at least did best -- emergency management. The virulence of the swine flu outbreak could create much suffering and havoc in the community. On the front lines of battling the disease is Ottawa Public Health, a responsibility of the City of Ottawa. This is the first major test of the chief medical officer of health, Dr. Isra Levy, who, with his staff, has so far risen to the challenge of warning Ottawans about the danger of the disease. Levy's department appears to have gotten past some earlier troubles with restricting media access and has developed an ambitious plan of immunization. Certainly, public health appears to be further along in its plans than its counterparts in the U.S.</p>
<p>Fast and effective immunization of Ottawa's populace could fend off a crisis in our community. The City of Ottawa has reacted well in the past. But after yesterday's enormous lineups, people will be watching very closely to see if it can do so again. If the city recovers from a rocky start and inoculations go smoothly from here, it will be good for the health of citizens, and help restore faith in what has become an inept city government.</p>

<p>I am most distressed with the Citizen's editorial cartoon on Saturday, likening H1N1 vaccination with plunging off a cliff ("Who's next?"), particularly in light of the front-page article about the misunderstandings of the vaccination program (nearly 30 per cent of respondents believe they can get the flu from a vaccination).</p>
<p>The danger to an individual from not getting vaccinated far, far exceeds the potential danger of the vaccination itself. An unvaccinated person may die from H1N1, and even if not, may pass the flu on to another person who may die from it. What are the dangers of getting vaccinated? Perhaps the Citizen's editorial cartoonist knows something that legions of scientists, doctors, and epidemiologists have so far overlooked. But I doubt it!</p>

<p>Re: Nearly half of Canadians won't get H1N1 shot, Oct. 24.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones are trying to dispel the fear of this flu shot out of Canadians' minds.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be a boost towards this goal if these officials organized a photo-op of health officials and politicians alike receiving their H1N1 shot? Preferably leading the way would be some of our most famous photo-op-hungry politicians. For maximum exposure, this occasion should take place on Parliament Hill. City officials also invited of course.</p>
<p>TV and newspaper coverage of this occasion would surely help to get present concerns quickly out of the way.</p>
<p>Deeds are always better than words. Don't waste any more time talking. Act now!</p>

<p>Re: Misinformation on vaccines is highly contagious, Oct. 24.</p>
<p>Thank you very much to Dr. Catherine D'Amico, for the helpful opinion article related to the H1N1 flu vaccination and the misinformation surrounding its use.</p>
<p>However, Dr. D'Amico didn't deal with the situation where the general public is still quite confounded about various reports of how anywhere from 40 to 50 per cent of health-care workers, which includes doctors, do not get flu shots. If her premise is correct that these professionals make up their minds based on the same faulty sources of information that the general public uses, such as through the Internet or the mass media, then we are in much worse shape than I had ever thought.</p>
<p>Surely these professionals, who are exposed to much greater levels of risk for infection than the rest of us, and who would have access to the most current scientific information on the risks and the need for preventative measures, must have a heightened sense of concern for their own safety and for that of their families.</p>
<p>And yet still about half of them do not get vaccinated for the flu. Where is the clarion call among the health-care professionals to step up and set the example? No wonder the public continues to be confused and skeptical.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Shots for all to age 18, Ontario says; Expanded school-age vaccination program to be rolled out starting this week</b>
</div><div>David Gonczol, With files from Tom Spears   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>972 words</div><div>27 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>The influenza death of a pre-teen in Eastern Ontario has prompted authorities to recommend that all school-age children in the province receive the H1N1 swine-flu vaccine as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It may be too late for some health units, including the City of Ottawa's, to change strategy in time to make a difference.</p>
<p>Children between six months and five years old have been one of the priority groups who are supposed to be first in line for H1N1 shots. The change, which would expand that group to include children up to age 18, was announced at a news conference Monday by Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, chief medical officer of health for the Eastern Ontario Health Unit, which covers the counties east of Ottawa and the City of Cornwall.</p>
<p>The girl who died of H1N1 flu at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario has not been identified, but she was from the territory covered by Roumeliotis's health unit.</p>
<p>During a news conference in Kemptville, Roumeliotis said he had decided to offer the vaccine to all school children within the unit's jurisdiction starting at regular H1N1 clinics opening in the region this Friday and going all weekend.</p>
<p>He said he discussed his decision with Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, and he said she was recommending all school-age children 18 and under in Ontario be offered the vaccine as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"I think it's quite appropriate for us to say now that we want to vaccinate all school-age children this week," Roumeliotis said. "It will be rolled out to the rest of the province during the next week."</p>
<p>Dr. Isra Levy, the City of Ottawa's chief medical officer of health, said his city would not ask school-age children to come in for shots during the first wave of "sequence" groups at higher risk.</p>
<p>"What we're still asking (is for) the sequence groups to be coming in first, and people who are not in the sequence groups to be holding on. This is something we're going to be doing for several weeks."</p>
<p>He said the priorities were developed during the summer after a lot of study, and he did not want to make sudden changes.</p>
<p>"The vaccine itself takes about 10 days to become effective, anyway," Levy said. "Those sequenced groups were considered by federal-provincial task groups and advisory groups over the summer and the decisions were made with the full knowledge of the epidemiology (the pattern of illness in society). So the evolving epidemiology on a day-to-day here is unlikely to change sequence groups, which are essentially decided on across the country. It's not a decision we would make here in Ottawa or anywhere else. This is a decision of the larger Canadian public-health community."</p>
<p>Roumeliotis said H1N1 clinics in his region would have extended hours on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and he also had to obtain a promise from provincial officials that they would increase the amount of vaccine his health unit would receive.</p>
<p>The area covered by Roumeliotis's health unit has been identified as a hotbed of H1N1 prevalence in Ontario, and it comprises the counties of Prescott, Russell, Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, and the City of Cornwall.</p>
<p>Roumeliotis said the death of the girl, believed to have been from Cornwall, was a major factor in expanding the vaccination program to all children, but he said the increasing numbers of people arriving at hospitals with flu symptoms had been making him "very anxious" to vaccinate all school children.</p>
<p>He said 26 of the area's 125 schools were "in outbreak, and most of them are H1N1."</p>
<p>Officials were releasing few details about the girl who died this past weekend from H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Roumeliotis said the girl had symptoms for several days before being admitted to hospital in Ottawa, where her condition deteriorated rapidly.</p>
<p>He said health officials believed the girl did not have any underlying health problems, but they were investigating the possibility that she may have had asthma.</p>
<p>"H1N1 behaves in a very abrupt way," Roumeliotis said.</p>
<p>"And what we see in situations in the emergency rooms is that they can be fine talking to you and be in a coma in half an hour."</p>
<p>William J. Gartland, director of education for the Catholic District School Board of Eastern Ontario, said the girl had been a student at one of the board's schools. He said a crisis response team was at the school to help staff and students cope with the girl's death.</p>
<p>"They are providing comfort and counselling to students who are worried and fearful about their health and the loss of someone they cared about," Gartland said. "They are helping students express and deal with the feelings and emotions. They are identifying students who are at risk of suffering emotionally and who may need additional support. They are relieving teachers so that they have time to deal with their own grief."</p>
<p>He said that the family had requested that additional information about the girl not be disclosed.</p>
<p>Roumeliotis said other members of the girl's family did not appear to be ill.</p>
<p>She is the first child and second person known to have died from the virus in the area covered by the Eastern Ontario Health Unit.</p>

</p>
<p>H1N1</p>
<p>Hundreds of residents turned away from sites</p>
<p>People asked to honour vaccination priority list</p>
<p>Officials encouraged by strong interest</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>They came in wheelchairs, strollers and walkers, with some waiting up to six hours to get their H1N1 flu shot.</p>
<p>On the first day the pandemic vaccine was offered to Ottawa residents, the lines were so long that within hours of opening their doors, the city's six vaccination clinics open Monday, stretching from Orléans to Kanata, were turning people away.</p>
<p>Many simply left without being vaccinated.</p>
<p>"There's too many people in there," said Jasmine Riddell, who had planned on getting her seven-year-old son immunized at the Richelieu- Vanier Community Centre. "I'm not waiting. It could take hours."</p>
<p>Within the first hour, the clinic at the Kanata Recreation Centre had announced that it would not allow any more people to join the queue, which by then had stretched to a four-hour wait.</p>
<p>An hour later, the clinic at the Fred Barrett Arena on Leitrim Road followed suit. Those already in line, such as Gerry Hayes, were told they faced up to a six-hour wait.</p>
<p>At some clinics, mothers waiting in crowded hallways brought lunches and toys for their children; others kept their young ones entertained with movies on laptop computers.</p>
<p>By 5 p.m., officials at Ottawa Public Health were warning that anyone who was just joining a line would probably not get a shot by the time the clinics closed at 8:30 or 9 p.m.</p>
<p>With an initial 74,000 doses of the vaccine reserved for people considered at high risk of developing life-threatening complications from the swine flu, many of those who turned out were pregnant women, children and people with chronic illnesses, such as Victor Stalpar.</p>
<p>He was in line at 100 Constellation Drive when the clinic opened at 5 p.m. By then, the line had snaked out the building and down the sidewalk toward the parking lot.</p>
<p>"I have chronic bronchitis, and that's why I'm down here," said Stalpar, 54, who arrived at the clinic more than two hours before it opened.</p>
<p>"My doctor recommended I get the shot."</p>
<p>Officials are relying on the general public to use the honour system and stay away from the clinics, at least until enough vaccine has been shipped to inoculate everyone in Ottawa who wants the shot.</p>
<p>Monday's higher-than-expected turnout prompted public-health officials to ponder ways to speed up the queues as the clinics continue today with another 37,500 doses expected to arrive.</p>
<p>"We have got a lot of interest, obviously, so that's promising," said Dr. Isra Levy, the city's medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"Our surveys have shown that there will be a lot of interest, and we have asked the public to be patient with us. We've anticipated that, for the first few days, there will be delays because there's only so much staff resources."</p>
<p>Levy said the delays were not caused by a lack of vaccine, but by the amount of time it took to process large groups. Nurses who give the shots also have to handle paperwork and keep computer records, Levy said.</p>
<p>By the time the system is running at full capacity, nurses should be able to deliver up to 12,000 vaccinations a day, Levy said.</p>
<p>One glitch has surfaced early: Health-care workers are in the high-priority group to be vaccinated, yet they must leave their workplaces to get shots at the public clinics, at least in the early days. As more shipments of the vaccine become available, some will be sent to hospitals, nursing homes and other health-care facilities.</p>
<p>Levy said he hoped to find ways to hurry health-care workers through the lines.</p>
<p>In the meantime, federal Liberal health critic Carolyn Bennett has raised concerns that local public health units across the country may not have enough resources to get shipments of the vaccine quickly to the frontlines.</p>
<p>Bennett said she had heard from some public-health officials who had to cut back on routine programs, such as health clinics for mothers and newborns, and redirect staff and funding to ensure the H1N1 vaccine was rolled out in a timely way.</p>
<p>"Some of the local public health (units) are going to have trouble," Bennett said. "They have no idea what the costs are going to be. They have no idea whether they're going to be reimbursed."</p>
<p>Given public-opinion polls that suggest many Canadians have misgivings about the H1N1 vaccine, officials had initially worried that not enough people would be willing to roll up their sleeves.</p>
<p>Instead, hundreds showed up even before the Ottawa clinics opened Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>At the Tom Brown Arena, just west of downtown, more than 300 people waited outside until the clinic doors opened; with no chairs available, the elderly leaned on walkers, waiting for their turn.</p>
<p>Tammie Ranger of Chesterville brought her six-month-old daughter, Jordyn, to the arena before 2 p.m. and was surprised to find out that a line had already formed.</p>
<p>"We thought we would be at the front of the line," Ranger said. In fact, the first person had been in line since 12 noon.</p>
<p>Asked why she chose to get her daughter vaccinated, Ranger replied: "I don't think we had a choice. I think it's the best thing to do."</p>
<p>At the Vanier clinic on Des Pères Blancs Avenue, traffic spilled onto the street as the parking lot filled up. By the time the clinic opened, more than 200 people were already waiting in line.</p>
<p>Among them was Sandra Tucker, who works at the Wabano Centre for Aboriginal Health. She arrived in a van with 10 seniors, all of whom were considered high risk because they have diabetes and other chronic illnesses, Tucker said.</p>
<p>As someone working on the frontlines of a social-service agency, Tucker felt it was her duty to get the pandemic vaccine.</p>
<p>"Because of where we work, it's responsible to get the vaccine to protect the others that we work with," she said.</p>
<p>Kathleen Quilty, who suffers from asthma, was among the first to get the vaccine at the Vanier clinic. After filling out her registration form, she waited while a triage nurse checked to make sure she belonged in a high-priority group. She was also asked to show her Ontario health card and answer several questions to identify which high-risk group she belonged to before finally being given the shot.</p>
<p>Quilty described the clinic as fast-paced and "a little chaotic."</p>
<p>Among the frustrated vaccine-seekers was Craig Dobson, 52, who said he had been near the head of the line when the computer system at the Vanier-Richelieu location failed. He and his daughter were just turned away, Dobson said, because the health unit could no longer record that they had received their shots.</p>
<p>"It took us four hours for that, and then it was probably 200 behind us waiting and 50 already in that room," Dobson said. Worse, he said, the staff said his and his daughter's numbers wouldn't get them priority treatment today.</p>
<p>"They said, 'We can't accommodate a policy like that.'"</p>
<p>City spokesman John Steinbachs said it wasn't actually a computer problem that caused the problem at the Vanier clinic.</p>
<p>"There may have been technical glitches at Vanier, but it wasn't the computer system having an issue. It was pure volume at Vanier that they chose to stop taking more people in, just so they could deal with the flow they have," Steinbachs said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the clinic on Centrum Boulevard in Orléans was jammed, and an overflow crowd spilled into the lobby and out the door.</p>
<p>Anne Coughlan, who brought her two sons, Fréderick and Maxime Lebel, to the clinic, said she wanted to get the vaccine for her children after hearing about the incidence of flu in the United States and about the girl who died of the flu at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario over the weekend.</p>
<p>However, only Fréderick, who's three, is eligible. At three months old, Maxime is too young.</p>
<p>"I think people are more concerned about the vaccine right now than they are about the flu," Coughlan said. "A lot of people are scared of getting the vaccine, but that doesn't make sense to me. The vaccine is there to stop the flu, not to hurt us."</p>
<p>Elizabeth Somerville, a registered nurse, said she had no concerns about the safety of the pandemic vaccine.</p>
<p>"It doesn't bother me that the vaccine hasn't been tested very much," Somerville said.</p>
<p>"I always get the regular flu vaccine, and I think it's much better to get immunized against the flu than to get sick."</p>

<p>H1N1 Q&A</p>
<p>Who's eligible for an H1N1 vaccination in Ottawa?</p>
<p>At first, the city wants to give vaccines only to the people who are at high risk from H1N1 influenza. Those are:</p>
<p>- People aged six months to 65 years with chronic medical conditions</p>
<p>- Healthy children from age six months to five years</p>
<p>- Front-line health workers</p>
<p>- Household contacts and caregivers to children younger than six months or to people with compromised immune systems</p>
<p>- Pregnant women</p>
<p>What's a 'chronic medical condition'?</p>
<p>According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, people with these conditions are at increased risk from H1N1 flu:</p>
<p>- heart disease</p>
<p>- diabetes</p>
<p>- asthma or lung disease</p>
<p>- kidney disease</p>
<p>- blood disorders</p>
<p>- severe obesity</p>
<p>- liver disease</p>
<p>- weakened immune systems from cancer drugs or HIV</p>
<p>- neurological disorders</p>
<p>Where do I go?</p>
<p>This week, five city-run superclinics are the best bet.</p>
<p>- Orléans Client Service Centre, 255 Centrum (2:30 to 8:30)</p>
<p>- Vanier Richelieu Community Centre, 300 Des Pères Blancs (2:30 to 8:30)</p>
<p>- Tom Brown Arena, 141 Bayview (2:30 to 8:30)</p>
<p>- Public Health headquarters, 100 Constellation (5 to 9)</p>
<p>- Kanata Recreation Complex (2:30 to 8:30)</p>
<p>All five are open 9 to 3 on weekends. Also this week, there's another major clinic at:</p>
<p>- Fred G. Barrett Arena, 3280 Leitrim (2:30 to 8:30)</p>
<p>A number of roving clinics start for downtown and rural Ottawa at the end of the week. See ottawacitizen.com/flu for a list.</p>
<p>What about clinics outside of Ottawa?</p>
<p>Other health units are running their own clinics and have information available.</p>
<p>- Renfrew County and district: www.rcdhu.com[http://www.rcdhu.com] or 613-735-8666</p>
<p>- Leeds, Grenville and Lanark: www.healthunit.org[http://www.healthunit.org] or 1-800-660-5853</p>
<p>- Counties east and southeast of Ottawa, plus Cornwall: www.eohu.ca[http://www.eohu.ca] or 1-800-267-7120</p>
<p>- Outaouais: www.santeoutaouais.qc.ca[http://www.santeoutaouais.qc.ca] or 811</p>
<p>What do I need to bring to an Ottawa clinic?</p>
<p>Only an Ontario health card is required, though parents should also bring their children's immunization records if the children are being vaccinated. If you're taking someone else's child, you'll need written permission from one of his or her parents. Given how long the lines were Monday, a portable stool, a book and a snack seem like a good idea.</p>
<p>What do I do when I get to an Ottawa clinic?</p>
<p>Join the line. Eventually, probably as you get into the building, you'll take a number, and then find a place to wait. A city worker will call a group of numbers at once, and then you'll register with public-health employees tracking who's getting the shots. After that, you'll wait again for your individual number to be called, and then a nurse will see you and give you your vaccination.</p>
<p>How long does all of this take?</p>
<p>On Monday, the Fred G. Barrett Arena had the longest lines (peaking at about six hours), and all the suburban locations had lines noticeably longer than the two downtown superclinics, where typically the wait was about two hours. People may choose to head into the city to try their luck there, though, and even things out.</p>
<p>I'm not in a priority group. When can I get a shot?</p>
<p>The city expects to open H1N1 vaccination to any Ontarian who wants one in seven to 14 days, depending on how many people from priority groups they can vaccinate and how quickly.</p>
<p>Where can I find out more?</p>

<p>Progressive Conservative MPP Lisa MacLeod discovered the gaffe after constituents in her Nepean-Carleton riding phoned her office.</p>

</p>
<p>Some people wake up to beeping alarm clocks. Or nuzzling cats. I wake up to the smell of urine, when my 30-pound son, Noah, sits on my face.</p>
<p>He is followed, quickly, by his 3-year-old sister, Lyla. By 6 a.m., we've already exhausted the harmonic possibilities of "Twinkle, Twinkle" and "Row, Row, Row Your Boat." I've explained to them the merits of sleeping till 7. It hasn't stuck.</p>
<p>I shower like a Marine - fast, efficient, often in cold water, during Lyla's experiments with the toilet handle. I'm usually accompanied by one of 1-year-old Noah's books, which he likes to hurl into the bathtub. Don't mention it to anyone else, but since I had kids, I don't shower as much. If a year spent farming in India didn't cure me of the Canadian addiction to soap products, two years of maternity leave spent in the same pair of spit-up splattered jeans did the job.</p>
<p>I then spend a considerable amount of time getting dressed - me first, dodging the closet doors as they play hide-and-seek, and then them.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge involves Noah's diaper. Especially if he's had a "big poo" - the only two-word term in his vocabulary. He doesn't like to be changed, and he really doesn't like to be changed lying down. I regularly have to wipe poo off the wall. I do it while listening to Andy Barrie on the radio interview smart people like Dr. Barbara Yaffe and lawyer Julian Falconer. It makes me feel smarter.</p>
<p>The BIG TEST comes when we all descend downstairs. If the dishes are put away, it means my husband still loves me. If they clutter the drying rack, it means WAR, which entails glowering and vigorous banging of cupboard doors while simultaneously assembling the kids' breakfast, answering the phone (it is my mother), and scanning the newspaper.</p>
<p>We used to fight about money and sex. Our battle lines now encircle two different zones - sleep and household chores. I think he gets more of the first and less of the second. He disagrees.</p>
<p>If only there were an Olympic event for multi-tasking ...</p>
<p>This morning, for instance, I talk on the phone (my sister) while running downstairs with the laundry hamper, and upstairs with puzzle pieces Noah is busily jettisoning through the baby gate.</p>
<p>While the hot cereal bubbles on the stovetop, I whisk the overflowing compost bin through our backyard mud patch into the green bin bunker - our shed - where it is safe from the sharp clutches of neighbourhood raccoons.</p>
<p>I scrawl notes on random pieces of paper. Things like: Social Conundrum for the Perfect Mother - make Halloween costume for beloved child to show dedication, and buy professional costume for self, so look hot. Buy milk.</p>
<p>I cut up a shrunken cantaloupe into unchokeable pieces, while phoning a neighbour to say I'll drop off a Crock-Pot of pulled pork for the farmers' market. We started the market two years ago. As a nice gesture, we decided to serve dinner to the farmers each night, before they head off on the long drive back to the country. My number's come up again.</p>
<p>I eat like a bird - not in quantity, but in flight.</p>
<p>Later, once I've swabbed faces and hands, I check email while overseeing an ambitious colouring project at the kitchen table.</p>
<p>My grandmother calls. My mother-in-law calls. This is why my husband no longer answers the phone. I see his point, but never admit it.</p>
<p>By the time my nanny arrives, I am ready to crawl back into bed, just for a minute.</p>
<p>Instead, Lyla and I kick red oak leaves on our way to the community centre, where she takes an art and gym class, and then I cram into the subway. I prefer biking to work for obvious reasons. But not when rain's in the forecast. I don't like having a wet stripe up my bum from the spray of my back wheel.</p>
<p>I fold the newspaper up into an accordion and read it wedged between two men, standing. Flipping pages during rush hour is a real art form.</p>
<p>I practise what I call the whooping crane - arms pinched to chest, then bursting in two arcs forward and returning.</p>
<p>I have mastered it only at stations, so I daydream in between pages: Why should there be an emphasis on boys-only classes in schools and not on girls?</p>
<p>Why has Health Canada banned toxic chemicals in baby bottles and not sippy cups, since kids' brains develop until they are three?</p>
<p>Why, whenever a woman is really good at a sport, is she still labelled a man - figuratively (Czech-American tennis sensation Martina Navratilova) and literally (South Africa's running ingenue Caster Semenya)?</p>
<p>Is that pregnant woman planning to take the H1N1 vaccine, despite concerns about the untested booster? Should she be worried about it? Hey buddy, give her a seat.</p>
<p>I look forward to work and my first quiet moment over a coffee. The day has just begun.</p>
<p>I tell you all this by way of introduction. I'm a new columnist here in the A section.</p>
<p>I'll be writing about things that affect women, which is to say things that affect most of us.</p>
<p>I've always thought that if someone tagged along for the first three hours of my day, they'd really get me.</p>
<p>Now you have.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>First-day lineup 3 hours of waiting; 'It's more than we anticipated,' officials say as 800 brave chill to get vaccine in Whitby</b>
</div><div>Jennifer Yang    </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>

</p>
<p>On Monday, the needles came out, the sleeves rolled up, and in Whitby, the waits were long.</p>
<p>Really, really long.</p>
<p>"I've been waiting an hour and 50 minutes," said Whitby resident Cassie Kastelic, at 5 p.m. She and her two teens were standing outside one of Ontario's first temporary H1N1 vaccination clinics and hadn't even made the front doors.</p>
<p>"I certainly expected an indoor setup; it just feels like it was not well thought out," said Kastelic. "It's like it's a third world country."</p>
<p>By the time the Kastelics got through the lines, the paperwork, and received their shots, it was 6: 30 p.m.</p>
<p>Daunting lineups and autumnal chill weren't enough to deter 800 people from getting that tiny jab that just might save their lives, said site manager Kim Davis.</p>
<p>"It's more than we anticipated," said Davis, an assistant manager with Durham's public health department. "As a second wave of the pandemic has started ... I think more people are aware now that this is happening," she said.</p>
<p>Away from the queues, though, skepticism about the vaccine continues in the general public.</p>
<p>An intensive-care doctor who was on the front lines in hard-hit Winnipeg during the first wave of H1N1 said he's astonished by public ambivalence, and says it's time for authorities to be blunt about the message. "Quite frankly, the fact that people are saying they aren't going to get vaccinated just blows me away because I think it's an absolute no-brainer, especially when you understand what's going on here," Dr. Anand Kumar told a major conference on critical care in Toronto on Monday.</p>
<p>"Do we have media here? I was going to say you have to be an idiot not to get the vaccine, but I won't say that," he told 400 health professionals and a few journalists who let him know they were present.</p>
<p>"It was bizarre, it was frightening, it was startling," Kumar said of last spring's outbreak. "These patients were coming at you really sick - the sickest group of patients I have seen in my life."</p>
<p>People queuing in Whitby didn't need convincing. Not everyone showing up was at high risk.</p>
<p>"I called the department of health line," said Anne Robertson, a dental clinic nurse. "I didn't really fall into the (priority) category but they said nobody would be turned away."</p>
<p>The clinic felt like a natural disaster emergency centre. Workers in bright vinyl vests hurried about carrying megaphones, and weary-looking people sat in waiting areas while children's wails filled the air.</p>
<p>Tirzah Chung, 36, who is 32 weeks pregnant, decided not to wait for adjuvant-free vaccines that are coming next week. The only downside, she said, was standing in line for 21/2 hours. "My pelvis really hurts," she laughed.</p>

<p>H1N1 influenza cases are growing at southern Ontario's public schools.</p>
<p>"It's starting to increase," said Anne Marie Aikins, a spokeswoman with Toronto Public Health.</p>
<p>At six Toronto schools, more than 10 per cent of students are absent with influenza symptoms, likely from the H1N1 virus. None of these schools has been closed.</p>
<p>Public health units are monitoring absentee rates at schools because the virus spreads easily among children in close quarters.</p>
<p>Public health officials have identified outbreaks in 32 of the 114 schools - nearly one-third - in the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board. One school in the public board reported 30 per cent of its students absent, though some may have been kept home for other reasons or as a preventative measure, said John Forbeck, a Hamilton board superintendent.</p>

<p>Clearing the decks for 2010</p>
<p>It's known as The Summer of LeBron, when James and a handful of other all-stars - Chris Bosh among them - can opt to become free agents. Every player move made during the season will be couched in terms of what it means financially next summer.</p>
<p>What's up in New Orleans?</p>
<p>It wasn't too long ago that the Hornets were seen as one of the good young teams to watch. Now, all-star Chris Paul has lost some key players and friends, coach Bryon Scott's in a lame-duck year and the Hornets are just another team. How will fans react?</p>
<p>Labour talks</p>
<p>With the referees back in the fold on a two-year deal, all attention will be shifted to the labour contract with the players. The current deal expires in 2011 but talks have already begun and the league will be looking for some kind of economic concessions.</p>
<p>Attendance</p>
<p>Times are tough all over and the amount of discretionary income is limited. Some teams are trying different methods of getting fans into their buildings - the Nets will come and visit if the price is right - and we should see some interesting marketing ploys.</p>
<p>Being careful not to be sick</p>
<p>The league has mandated that any player showing signs of a flu needs to be tested for the H1N1 virus and kept away from the team. There will be more hand sanitizer than you can imagine around every franchise to help avoid spreading the virus.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Niqabs, face masks and Canadian blinkers</b>
</div><div>Martin Regg Cohn   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>760 words</div><div>27 October 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>This is not another media column about niqabs and burqas, the facial veils that attract so many eyeballs on the blogosphere.</p>
<p>This is a cautionary tale about a different kind of facial covering I encountered, unexpectedly, in Saudi Arabia several years ago.</p>
<p>Boarding my flight home, I assumed some of the Islamic veils would be lifted because female passengers often remove their head scarves after takeoff, away from the prying eyes of religious police.</p>
<p>Taking my seat, however, I discovered even more faces were covered: It was early 2003 and SARS was in the air - prompting my fellow passengers to don N-95 masks as protection.</p>
<p>Niqabs and N-95s. There wasn't a smile to be seen while airborne.</p>
<p>Nor at Ground Zero once we landed in Hong Kong, where I was based at the time. Indeed, there were probably more covered faces in that subtropical port city than in the desert air of Riyadh.</p>
<p>For the next few weeks, Hong Kong became a masked society that felt, and looked, utterly cloistered. A city of 7 million souls collectively held its breath - and cursed under its breath about medical malfeasance across the border in mainland China.</p>
<p>Now, as the spectre of H1N1 looms, should we worry that a pandemic might leave Canada more veiled than Saudi Arabia or Hong Kong?</p>
<p>I don't think we can close our eyes to some disturbing patterns here in Canada - then and now.</p>
<p>Toronto experienced its own painful crisis during the SARS era - not just medical, but political. It was plagued by some of the same lack of co-ordination and lagging disclosure that infected China, a world away.</p>
<p>Our city was blacklisted by the World Health Organization as a no go zone, costing us an estimated $1 billion. WHO targeted two countries - Canada and China - for failing to disclose timely information about the spread of SARS. When WHO wanted to know more about the situation in Toronto, it became embarrassingly obvious that the information was falling through the cracks.</p>
<p>Our antiquated reporting practices were borne out of historic federal-provincial rivalry, duplication and distrust. When WHO toughened its disclosure rules requiring national governments to send in epidemiological data in real time - not play telephone tag with the provinces - Ottawa pledged to rewrite its rules in 2006.</p>
<p>It didn't. The federal auditor general raised alarm bells in her 2008 report, warning that Canada was still not in compliance.</p>
<p>The federal Public Health Agency "relies on the goodwill of the provinces and territories to supply the needed information and this flow has sometimes been interrupted," the report concluded ominously. "In the event of a public health emergency, the agency runs the risk of not obtaining the information needed to do an assessment of the situation within 48 hours, to notify the WHO within 24 hours ... as required, because information-sharing agreements with the provinces and territories are missing."</p>
<p>We now know that the listeriosis outbreak of a year ago was exacerbated by a lack of communication between Ottawa and the provinces, allowing crucial data to once again fall through the cracks. Are we prepared to act in a coordinated way now that H1N1 is upon us?</p>
<p>If 190 countries can co-operate, why can't 10 provinces and the federal government? Instead, we've had dissenting voices and conflicting approaches, with the provinces going their own way instead of embracing a pan-Canadian strategy.</p>
<p>No wonder the latest opinion polls show the general public is full of doubts about the efficacy and safety of the new vaccine. By contrast, the U.S. is showing unity of purpose, with the surgeon general taking charge and President Barack Obama showing leadership. He declared a state of emergency over the weekend to ensure rapid decision-making if things get worse.</p>
<p>I'm no authority on the science of swine flu, but I worry about the politics of it.</p>
<p>In the weeks and months to come, I certainly intend to do my bit by lining up for both the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. But I also expect our federal and provincial governments to get their act together - by cooperating the way WHO expects them to.</p>
<p>These days, I find myself thinking back to the niqabs and N-95s on my flight home in 2003 - and wondering why Canada's competing governments are still wearing blinkers all these years later.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Long lines at city H1N1 clinics - Opening-day vaccine rush settles down</b>
</div><div>By Bill Redekop and Eva Cohen    </div>
<div>1020 words</div><div>27 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>Thousands of people across Manitoba rolled up their sleeves Monday to begin the great mass H1N1 vaccination of 2009.</p>
<p>In Winnipeg, 4,000 people were vaccinated by 3 p.m. Lineups stretched out the door to parking lots and waits were an hour or more at some locations when clinics opened.</p>
<p>But by late morning, the clinics settled down to a steady flow. At the Portage Avenue location, the wait time by mid-morning was 40 minutes, and there were enough chairs available to keep everyone comfortable.</p>
<p>In East Kildonan, the wait at a Munro Avenue church hall was about 45 minutes in the early afternoon.</p>
<p>The vaccine program is expected to run the next four to six weeks.</p>
<p>The rush of people the first day caused a nursing shortage, and some nurses not scheduled for the opening shift were called in at the last minute.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority also put out the call for more volunteers in the coming days to help with greeting the public, assisting with registration and consent forms, and observing the post-immunization wait.</p>
<p>"There are a number of things we learned the first day, like the need for better signage... " said Heidi Graham, spokeswoman for the WRHA.</p>
<p>Also, some sites are getting more traffic, so the WRHA will allocate its resources accordingly, she said. It's too early to say when the best times to visit are but she said mid-morning and mid-afternoon may be slowest.</p>
<p>Since children are one of the largest recommended groups for early vaccination, clinics were filled with strollers, toddlers and young mothers.</p>
<p>Michelle Vancaeseele, who arrived at the Grant Avenue clinic at mid-morning with her two-and-a-half-year-old son Mark, said her son is "like most kids" when it comes to needles, but there was no question she wanted to be immunized.</p>
<p>"The risks are quite small and are far outweighed by the potential benefits," said Vancaeseele. "We're going to take our chances. Mark and I are getting it done (Monday morning) and my husband is getting his later this week."</p>
<p>In northern Manitoba, the Burntwood Regional Health Authority opened clinics in Thompson at noon Monday and traffic was "pretty steady," said Blake Ellis, authority spokesman.</p>
<p>The clinics expect to be very busy in the initial weeks because 70 per cent of the Burntwood health authority's population of 45,000 is aboriginal and considered at greater risk. Clinics will also be flown to remote communities like Lake Brochet and Thicket Portage.</p>
<p>The recommended groups to receive immunization within the first weeks are those with heart disease, people with aboriginal and Métis ancestry, and children over six months and under five years of age. For the elderly, just in case the location you go to does not have enough chairs available, perhaps choose to bring a walker with a seat on it.</p>
<p>All that is needed to get the shot is a Manitoba Health Card.</p>
<p>Volunteers and nurses all wear fluorescent vests to guide and keep everything moving.</p>
<p>But flu-shot clinics didn't open in all parts of the province on Monday. Regions like Brandon, the Parkland, northeastern and southeastern Manitoba, don't open their clinics until today.</p>
<p>And in Central Manitoba, including Portage la Prairie, the Pembina Valley and six First Nations, immunization clinics don't open until Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The directive from the province was to have clinics open the week of Oct. 26, not on Oct. 26. (Opening later) was just a better fit for us as far as our resources," said Kathy McPhail, CEO of the Regional Health Authority -- Central Manitoba.</p>
<p>Clinics were active in southwestern Manitoba as well. The Assiniboine Regional Health Authority is doing clinics by appointment, so it knows how much vaccine is needed at any of its 11 clinics, said CEO Penny Gilson.</p>
<p>An Angus Reid poll released Monday said 39 per cent of Canadians and more than half of Americans do not plan to get the vaccine. A lack of confidence in the product is the main reason given. But a third of Canadians say they are not concerned about contracting the virus.</p>
<p>Winnipeg has 12 clinics and most have the same operation hours of Monday to Thursday from 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canada announced Monday it is importing adjuvant-free H1N1 vaccine from Australia for pregnant women, hoping to be able to offer that product sooner than if it waits for unadjuvanted vaccine from Canada to make it through the licensing process.</p>
<p>bill.redekop@freepress.mb.ca eva.cohen@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>BRITISH COLUMBIA: Long lines were the norm at vaccination clinics, and some were even turned away due to vaccine shortages. In the Vancouver area, turnout was higher than expected and one clinic had to turn people away. At a downtown Vancouver clinic, people waited up to 40 minutes.</p>
<p>ALBERTA: Residents waited up to four hours to be vaccinated. Clinics in Calgary stopped anyone new from lining up after 5 p.m., and clinics were still to stay open until 11 p.m. to deal with the backlog. Alberta had asked that high-risk groups get their shot first, but had also said no one would be turned away.</p>
<p>SASKATCHEWAN: Mass vaccinations of people involved in health care began Monday, amid concerns voiced by some workers. By next week, the vaccine will be offered to about 120,000 people with high-risk conditions.</p>
<p>ONTARIO: An Ottawa clinic had to turn away prospective patients after it became clear by mid-afternoon the wait time was about four hours, and nurses would not be able to immunize everyone by closing time.</p>
<p>QUEBEC: In Montreal, a delay in the delivery of the H1N1 vaccine meant 155,000 doses were only shipped out Monday. Vaccination is to start Wednesday.</p>
<p>NEW BRUNSWICK: Thousands of nurses, doctors and medical specialists took an H1N1 shot in the arm.</p>

<p>It didn't hurt.</p>
<p>I got my H1N1 shot Monday morning. The most painful part was the brief wait.</p>
<p>A media event was held at the Franco-Manitoban Cultural Centre to convince the public to get their shots. It was packed with aboriginal leaders, health officials and adorable children whose parents had agreed to have the tykes immunized in front of the cameras.</p>
<p>Dr. Sande Harlos, WRHA medical officer of health didn't blink as the needle slid in. David Chartrand, president of the Manitoba Métis Federation clearly wished he was somewhere else. His grandkids had already rolled up their sleeves so he was trapped.</p>
<p>Dr. Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief provincial public health officer, jokingly asked the nurse swabbing his arm if she'd given an injection before.</p>
<p>Cameras caught each poke, clearly hoping for a wince. Chartrand's tiny granddaughter obliged, shouting "no, no, no!" and bursting into tears.</p>
<p>She got a sucker when it was over. I didn't.</p>
<p>While the government is urging people in the most vulnerable categories to be immunized in the first few weeks of the clinics, they say the average person can wait a little longer. In fact, they'd prefer if you did.</p>
<p>There will be enough vaccine for all Manitobans.</p>
<p>It seemed as if everyone in the province wanted their shot Monday. The lineup was two hours long at the Grant Park Shopping Centre by early afternoon. An estimated 400 people, many of them elderly, were there when the clinic opened at the shopping centre.</p>
<p>Seniors are not one of the high-risk groups unless they have an underlying medical condition.</p>
<p>If you're aboriginal, have a chronic medical problem, are a preschooler, are homeless, live in an isolated area, have a weakened immune system or are a health-care worker or medical first responder, the WRHA would like you to roll up your sleeve in the first round of vaccinations.</p>
<p>I fit two of those categories. No, I'm not homeless but thanks for asking.</p>
<p>There was never any question I would get the vaccine. I've been seriously ill. If they can prevent me from hitting a hospital, bring it on.</p>
<p>Nurse Anna Cotroneo volunteered at the St. Boniface clinic. Normally she's a case co-ordinator for the Manitoba Home Care Program. Before nurses are allowed to dole out H1N1 shots they have their skills assessed, read material on-line and scan a list of questions patients may have.</p>
<p>"I knew they might be short (of nurses)," she said sitting at a table covered with syringes, Band-Aids, cotton balls and hand sanitizer. "I want to help."</p>
<p>I rolled up my sleeve, she swabbed, and the needle went in, tender as a mother's kiss.</p>
<p>People in line said they didn't hesitate to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>"I've had all my vaccinations and it's worked out well," said retired teacher Diane Plamondon. "Why wouldn't I get this one?"</p>
<p>There is a fear out there that the vaccine was rushed, that we're not sure what it will do to us in the long term and that we're being treated as guinea pigs.</p>
<p>What I know is that H1N1 is hitting people harder than the seasonal flu. It's making them much more ill. They're spending more time in hospital and on respirators.</p>
<p>Between 4,000 and 8,000 Canadians die from the seasonal flu each year. I got that shot, too. If there's a chance to avoid a life-threatening illness, I'm taking it.</p>
<p>Would I get the vaccine if I were pregnant? No, and it's not recommended this go-around. There will be another version shortly. Would I immunize my young children? In a flash. Watch a kindergarten class for 20 minutes and you'll see a living illustration of how germs are spread.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was mild chaos at the clinics, some grumbling from people waiting for their shots and no clear sense of where the paperwork was supposed to go once the Band-Aid was applied. They'll work it out.</p>
<p>Only seven Manitobans have died of H1N1. In the States, more than 1,000 have died since August. We don't know what the next stage of the pandemic will bring.</p>
<p>I only know I want to be healthy enough to tell you all about it.</p>

<div>THE H1N1 PANDEMIC</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Historic vaccine rollout begins as flu ramps up; Priority for prisoners B.C. correctional officers angered by plans to vaccinate inmates before prison staff, fearing overcrowded detention centres will become breeding grounds for flu</b>

</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -- British Columbia's sheriffs and correctional officers were alarmed yesterday to discover that the H1N1 vaccine is being made available first to prisoners and then to staff.</p>
<p>Authorities are gearing up to provide the option of an H1N1 shot to all inmates, Dean Purdy, a spokesman for the union committee representing 2,500 sheriffs and correctional officers, said in an interview. He spoke shortly after a phone conversation with a provincial health official on how the H1N1 crisis would be handled in B.C. detention centres.</p>
<p>But with provincial jails operating at close to 200-per-cent capacity, he said, the virus could spread rapidly beyond the prison bars.</p>
<p>“We'd like to see them make it a priority to provide the [vaccine to] staff at the same time, to give staff the opportunity to take the vaccine right away,” Mr. Purdy said.</p>
<p>“It's the responsibility of employers … to protect workers from injury or exposure to this type of situation on the job. We would like to see the staff have the same option [as prisoners], to have access to the vaccination right now.”</p>
<p>“… If this virus takes hold and this thing goes sideways, we want our workers protected.”</p>
<p>B.C. health officials have announced that H1N1 shots will be available this week for women more than 20 weeks pregnant, people under 65 who have chronic health conditions and people in remote and rural communities.</p>
<p>The program is scheduled to expand to children and health-care providers in the second week, although at least one doctor's office in Vancouver scheduled an H1N1 shot for an infant for later this week. The vaccination is expected to be available for the rest of British Columbians in mid-November.</p>
<p>B.C. jails have close to 3,000 inmates in about 1,500 cells in six maximum- and three minimum-security facilities. Mr. Purdy is the chairperson of the committee that represents correctional officers and sheriffs who are members of the B.C. Government and Service Employees' Union.</p>
<p>Ian Indridson, a senior public affairs officer with the B.C. Ministry of Public Safety, said inmates with chronic health problems will receive H1N1 immunizations this week. Correctional-centre employees will receive H1N1 vaccinations beginning next week, he said in an e-mail response to a request for an interview.</p>
<p>Inmates who receive the H1N1 shots could be released this week either from remand centres or upon completing their sentences, he said. “So by immunizing inmates who are at higher risk of H1N1, we are better protecting the community at large,” Mr. Indridson said.</p>
<p>The priority given to prisoners reflects the direction provided by health authorities and the Provincial Health Officer, he added. “This approach is reflective of how the vaccine is being administered to the general population,” Mr. Indridson said.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, Craig Jones, the executive director of the John Howard Society of Canada, warned that Canada's overcrowded detention facilities were incubation centres for the flu. Confining the virus to a penal institution would be difficult, he said in correspondence with federal Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan and Correctional Service Canada Commissioner Don Head.</p>
<p>“Overcrowding will likely result in spillover to correctional officers, staff and communities, and create potential disruption in the operations of institutions,” he stated, adding that the advocacy group intended to monitor the situation closely.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones said yesterday he intends to raise the issue again later this week, when he expects to meet with Mr. Head.</p>

</div><div>Doug Speirs / In the Doug House   </div>
<div>873 words</div><div>27 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>As part of my ongoing journalistic quest to protect your right to know, today I will once again cross swords with other big-shot media personalities in UNICEF's annual Celebrity Pumpkin Carving Contest.</p>
<p>Yes, while some journalists are frittering away their time talking to whistleblowers, freeing wrongly convicted prisoners and getting the bird's-eye lowdown on H1N1 flu, I will be up to my elbows in gooey pumpkin guts.</p>
<p>I realize you, the newspaper reader, are grateful, but there is no need to thank me. It's my job.</p>
<p>But if, like me, you have too much free time on your hands, I strongly urge you to put down whatever you are doing and come out to Kildonan Place Shopping Centre at 11:45 a.m. to watch this high-stakes gourd-related event.</p>
<p>I was delighted to be invited back for the second annual contest because (a) it raises awareness and funds for UNICEF's Trick-or-Treat campaign, which has been going on since 1955 and is poised to cross the $100-million mark; and (b) it's pretty much the only time I am encouraged to wander around a local shopping centre brandishing a large kitchen knife without being gang-tackled by mall security.</p>
<p>Last year, I was confident I'd be declared the Pumpkin King because I come from a family with a glorious tradition in the world of competitive carving. My mom was the Michelangelo of pumpkins. Every Halloween when I was a kid, she created massive pumpkin displays that were eerily similar to the Sistine Chapel, only more elaborate and with a lot more candles.</p>
<p>We usually had twice as many pumpkins as we had costumed kids pounding on our door demanding treats, which was OK because it meant we had enough of those little chocolate bars left over to put a small Third World nation into a sugar-induced coma.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I did not inherit my mother's carving wizardry, just as I did not inherit my father's handyman skills, a fact that became evident in high school when EVERY (bad word) project I made in metal shop -- candle holders, wheelbarrows, handguns -- ended up resembling an ashtray.</p>
<p>I once attempted to make a jack-o'-lantern using my wife's power drill, which resulted in the pumpkin spinning around like an astronaut in a centrifuge until it skittered away and turned into pie filling after slamming into a wall.</p>
<p>So I'm not overly talented in the carving department, which is probably why I bombed in last year's competition, wherein I attempted to wow the judges with something called The Puking Pumpkin, a revolting jack-o'-lantern that appears to be violently losing its lunch via the genius artistic technique of having gallons of gooey pumpkin guts spewing from its gaping mouth.</p>
<p>You'd think a pumpkin with that kind of artistic merit would have been a natural choice, but apparently I was wrong. The big winner last year was legendary children's entertainer Fred Penner, who I am pleased to announce will not be defending his title. Not that I am bitter.</p>
<p>Instead, I will be up against an assortment of "outstanding local celebrities," including local TV and radio weather persons; Jacqueline Chaput of the Winnipeg Police Service, who will not be bringing a gun; and Big Daddy Tazz, who is one of Canada's hottest comedians and, like myself, not the sort of person you want to see wielding a knife in a shopping centre.</p>
<p>In an effort to improve on last year's performance, I'm going to do the one thing you'd expect from a journalist of my standing in the community -- I'm going to cheat.</p>
<p>Seriously, I called the nice folks at UNICEF and asked whether they felt it would be a good idea for me to cheat, and they said, sure, go for it. "The only thing you CAN'T do is pre-carve your pumpkin," Tricia Schers, director of the charity's Prairie region, explained.</p>
<p>However -- and please do NOT tell anyone I told you this, because there are a lot of cheaters out there -- Tricia agreed to email me secret photos and instructions showing how to make a pumpkin that won big in a similar contest in Alberta.</p>
<p>What's really exciting is this top-secret pumpkin is potentially even more nauseating than the vomiting pumpkin, which Tricia agreed was "a classic." So I've got that going for me.</p>
<p>"We're not about being correct," she confided. "We're about having fun."</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm hoping fans of high-quality journalism will come watch me carve my way to glory.</p>
<p>For a measly $2 you can buy a ballot to vote for your favourite pumpkin. You can even buy the pumpkins, with the cash going to help schools in Rwanda and Malawi.</p>
<p>So, please, come out and cheer me on. The only thing I ask is that, while applauding, you do not make any sudden noises.</p>
<p>Because I've got a knife.</p>

<p>Winnipeg -- Why all the media fuss about swine flu (Fewer Canadians Interested In Getting H1N1 Shot – front page, Oct. 26)? Somehow, a comparatively mild disease has attracted overwhelming media coverage. At the same time, a vaccine of questionable efficacy has been portrayed as our best hope for salvation.</p>
<p>The southern hemisphere has just gone through its flu season. In New Zealand, where 18,000 swine flu deaths had been predicted, the actual toll came to 17. Similar data have been reported from Australia and Argentina. The evidence is clear: Swine flu is a bust for doom-mongers. Perhaps this explains why so many Canadians are reluctant to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Although the pandemic industry claims 90-per-cent effectiveness for the new swine flu vaccine, this does not mean the vaccine prevents flu in 90 per cent of cases. This figure refers to the percentage of people who develop antibodies in their blood after taking the vaccine. Will these people gain significant immunity as a result? There is no good scientific evidence showing this is the case.</p>
<p>Our public health establishment has enjoyed its day in the sun. Big Pharma has trucked fabulous profits to the bank. Perhaps it's time for our media to turn their attention to more serious problems.</p>

<p>With the H1N1 vaccine arriving at schools, doctor's offices and community centres, all Canadians need to ask themselves: Do I take this vaccine? Competing claims about the risks of the vaccine, the severity and likelihood of contracting the disease, and the measures needed to stop the spread of the flu abound. Ultimately, Canadians, with a few exceptions, should take the vaccine. Just as important as the decision itself are the thinking, reflection and research that Canadians should undertake in advance of their decision.</p>
<p>Granted, these are confusing times, and voices opposing the official medical community's line are many. Some espouse conspiracy theories: The vaccine is a plot to line the pockets of pharmaceutical executives; it will cause autism or Guillain-Barré syndrome. Others play down the risks: If doctors and nurses refuse it, why should I submit to it? Meanwhile, Canadians absorb contradictory messages from governments (on whether the vaccine replaces the annual flu shot) and fear-inducing but spottily applied edicts from community organizations (handshaking is now a no-no in some religious congregations and hockey leagues).</p>
<p>Canadians have a free choice. But they also have responsibilities: not to act as agents of flu dissemination, and to minimize their burden on the health-care system. To perform these obligations, they need to act positively, developing two kinds of literacy.</p>
<p>First, scientific literacy: Flu strains are best fought by the immune system with a vaccine containing antigens, which prompt the production of anti-H1N1 antibodies. The flu is highly contagious, so it is still best to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>A measure of statistical literacy is also necessary. The key question when considering vaccination is, What are the chances of my contracting a side effect by taking the vaccine, and are they greater than the risk I and others face by not taking the vaccine? People also need to be aware how much a disease can spread, once it is unleashed by enough carriers amid a largely unvaccinated population.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean Canadians should start suddenly flocking to advanced scientific journals. But they should make the effort to educate themselves on the basic science and statistics of disease, and apply some common sense when presented with alluring stories or cherry-picked data points.</p>
<p>And when this year's pandemic is beyond us, the need for Canadians to be scientifically and statistically literate will remain. Climate change, reproductive technologies and criminal justice are three complex policy areas that require these aptitudes. By developing them now, Canadians might even immunize themselves against harmful choices the next time.</p>

<p>Toronto -- I'm a retired physician who'll continue to get my flu shots. The flood of opposing views brings to mind an instructive story. Historian Michael Bliss's The Plague details the similar confused public debate about vaccination that clouded the Montreal smallpox epidemic of 1875. In that year, the disease claimed more than 3,000 lives in the city. Mr. Bliss documented misinformation about vaccination from the press and clergy that steered the debate against inoculation – and greatly influenced the outcome of that epidemic.</p>

<p>I haven't been feeling well. I'm lethargic and feverish, and my appetite is gone. Worst of all, I've been overcome with a compulsive desire to wash my hands with Purell every five minutes. Could it be that I have Swine Flu Overkill?</p>
<p>SFO is a serious illness caused by saturation media coverage and repetition of the word “pandemic.” I'm not one to minimize the horrors of the H1N1 virus, which can be unpleasant and even fatal. But please, people. Can't we get a grip? The CBC has been covering swine flu as if it were the biggest natural disaster since Hurricane Katrina. The newspapers have been full of drama about whether there will be enough vaccine, whether it's arriving fast enough, and if not, who's to blame. Ordinary citizens are feverishly researching the ins and outs of adjuvants, and wondering if they should drive to the next town so their kids can be vaccinated right away.</p>
<p>Meantime, a lot of people have said the hell with it. It's hard to blame them. Ever since the spring, when the World Health Organization declared swine flu to be a “pandemic” – after just 144 deaths – SFO has been running rampant. Ordinary pandemics kill at least a million people worldwide. Swine flu has killed around 5,000 people, including 86 in Canada. Worldwide, ordinary seasonal flu kills 700 to 1,400 people a day.</p>
<p>But everybody loves a good health scare. Remember BSE? Infected cows were going to turn our brains to mush. Then came SARS. In 2003, one widely quoted British expert predicted that it could turn out to be more lethal than AIDS. The final death toll from SARS was 774 – about one day's worth of flu victims. Then came deadly birds. In 2006, David Nabarro, a top WHO official, warned that avian flu could kill 150 million people. The White House's avian flu response plan projected that as many as two million Americans might die, and one leading influenza researcher warned that a pandemic might kill half the human population. To date, the worldwide death toll from avian flu is 262.</p>
<p>All these panics have a lot in common: a legitimate concern that's blown wildly out of proportion by various interest groups, including scientists and public-health agencies, whose warnings are then amplified by the media. Politicians have no choice but to respond in kind, just in case. This outbreak has followed the usual course. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology recently predicted that there might be 30,000 to 90,000 U.S. deaths from swine flu, peaking in mid-October. (That would be a week ago.) To date the U.S. death toll has barely reached a thousand, but the President has declared a national emergency anyway.</p>
<p>Ironically, the more the public hears about how important it is to get the shot, the more skeptical it gets. In the U.S., only half the population plans to get it, according to surveys, and a third oppose it for their kids. In Canada, 51 per cent of us are saying we won't bother – up from 38 per cent in July.</p>
<p>Perversely, all the flu news raises the profile of the nutty anti-vaccinationists – people who believe that vaccines cause autism or brain poisoning, or that children are better off if they get the flu, or that the vaccine campaign is a plot by greedy drug companies, or (as Rush Limbaugh says) that the whole thing is a plot to expand the power of government and “to cover up the mess that is the United States of America right now.” The epidemic of coverage also feeds a growing sense that the risks are overblown.</p>
<p>As for me, despite my SFO, I'm definitely going to get the shot. Although I'm in a low-risk group, the last thing I want to do is wind up in hospital, where MSRA, C. difficile, and other hospital-acquired infections kill around 8,000 Canadians a year. My advice is that whatever you do, stay out of the hospital – or you might get really sick.</p>

<div>THE H1N1 RISK</div>
<div>Comment</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Refusing to get vaccinated is selfish; Canadians who decide against having the flu shot should consider the harm that might come to other people and the health-care system</b>

<p>A recent poll indicated that 48 per cent of Canadians might refuse the H1N1 vaccination – and that number went up to 51 per cent in an online poll reported in yesterday's Globe and Mail. These figures suggest that many Canadians are not considering the public good and have a misguided understanding of their personal interest.</p>
<p>According to Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, David Butler-Jones, the risk of experiencing severe side effects after receiving the shot is one in a million, compared with the 20 to 35 per cent of the population who will get sick from this pandemic flu without protection. “If every single Canadian is inoculated,” he said, “then 30 Canadians could have the potential for a severe side effect, compared to 10 million people sick, 100,000 people in hospital and 10,000 people dead.”</p>
<p>In the face of such numbers, Canadians should consider not just the risks to themselves, their loved ones and those with whom they come in contact, but also to our health-care system.</p>
<p>The public nature of Canadian health care creates both individual rights and individual responsibilities. But people can assert rights to a public resource without recognizing a responsibility toward its limited nature. This problem was brilliantly described in 1968 by ecologist Garrett Hardin in the journal Science as “the tragedy of the commons.” In this hypothetical case, individual actors operate on self-interest and ultimately destroy a shared limited resource – even when such destruction is clearly not to anyone's long-term benefit. Canadians are familiar with this tragedy because it describes the collapse of the Atlantic cod fishery.</p>
<p>Mass H1N1 vaccination refusal similarly might destroy (at least temporarily) our health-care system, with the threatened 100,000 people in hospital. We have a limited number of hospital beds and respirators and a finite number of people who know how best to use them. Every vaccinated person increases the likelihood that health-care professionals will be free to treat other people. What's more, inoculation reduces transmission. If unvaccinated people make health-care workers sick, they cannot look after other patients.</p>
<p>While the tragedy of the commons can shed light on vaccination choice, it cannot explain why an individual would choose to act against his or her self-interest. (The cod fishers who depleted the fish stocks to the detriment of future generations at least enjoyed immediate personal benefit.)</p>
<p>Although vaccine refusers seem motivated to avoid personal risk, they are really acting from misinformation and a one-sided view of risk. Public-health officials have tried to transfer their considerable knowledge to those fearful of vaccination. But they are up against the Internet, which makes plentiful both good and bad information.</p>
<p>Moreover, lay people can be confused by publicly available scientific information because they don't understand the scientific method or conversations scientists have among themselves. If a scientist were 99-per-cent certain that something is true, the scientist would reveal and discuss the 1-per-cent uncertainty. Therefore, for lay people to state that the scientist is uncertain is to misstate the conversation.</p>
<p>Some vaccination refusers also imply that public-health officials are in the pocket of the pharmaceutical industry. But we pay these officials to act in the public interest. And, almost certainly, their moral disposition is to act in the public interest. Moreover, the Canadian public service has systems to ensure that its officials are not directed by private or foreign interests.</p>
<p>If half of Canadians refuse vaccination, our limited health-care resources (people, medical supplies and physical infrastructure) will probably be depleted. How can we avoid such a tragedy?</p>
<p>This year's Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to Elinor Ostrom for demonstrating that if those people who are threatened by the depletion of scarce resources repeatedly interact, then they change their behaviour to safeguard the threatened commons.</p>
<p>Such interaction includes talking. Perhaps the gravity of the current situation requires unusually frank conversation among Canadians, such as, “My diabetic child needs ongoing access to health care that you, refusing H1N1 vaccination for yourself and your children, might block.”</p>
<p>It seems better to have these conversations now than next year when it might be too awful to speak about how vaccination refusal put such a strain on health-care resources that loved ones with other conditions died.</p>
<p>Canadians share a common plight: an influenza pandemic; an already overstretched public health-care system tending to a vulnerable and aging population; the availability of a safe and effective H1N1 vaccine; and our Chief Public Health Officer's recommendation to become vaccinated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>These facts require citizens to decide how best to assess personal interest and to reconcile it with the duty to protect the public good.</p>
<p>We are entitled to share in limited health-care resources. How much will we demand? We are invited to be vaccinated against H1N1. How will we each respond?</p>

<p>I have watched with interest the reaction of Canadians to the H1N1 virus information as it has been evolving. It seems to me that Canada is more ready to tackle the virus because of the lessons learned by health officials during the SARS outbreak and these</p>
<p>officials are ably supported by the efficiency of Canada's chief public health officer supported by the minister of health.</p>
<p>In August, the minister, along with her officials, announced that a safe vaccine would be ready for use at the beginning of November and this is now happening.</p>
<p>Any confusion among the population has been caused by what I call pseudo-experts during media interviews making false statements and claims and also provincial health officials reacting to every piece of information whether it had been confirmed or not.</p>
<p>An example is the media reports on an unpublished study done in B.C. that said someone taking the regular flu vaccine would be more inclined to get H1N1. This study could not be verified and yet some provincial health officials acted</p>
<p>on this report to change from the well-thought-out plan that was in place.</p>
<p>Opposition MPs also caused confusion by chasing unconfirmed speculation.</p>
<p>The percentage of the population who normally get the regular flu vaccine is not high and if we treat H1N1 flu like regular flu, the country could allow this virus to take hold and become more invasive than it should be.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan is ready. Everyone can have the vaccine, so be patient and let the plan roll out.</p>

<p>Your coverage includes some statistics dealing with the H1N1 virus. One of the numbers was 50,000,000, described as the "number of doses of vaccine purchased in advance by the Canadian federal government." Yet Statistics Canada says that as of July 2009, there were 33,739,859 of us Canadians. What is the government planning to do with all the extra vaccine it bought? Or is this just another example of large government waste?</p>

<p>Re: H1N1 Virus: By The Numbers, Oct. 24.</p>
<p>Thanks for the statistics on the swine flu "pandemic." As Michael Fumento has noted, it's "more of a piglet than a raging razorback piglet." We're the same level of attention paid to the myriad under-reported adverse events produced by pharmaceuticals on a daily basis, the word "pandemic" would be put to better use. Perspective and bank accounts, is what it's really all about.</p>

<p>A branch of Toronto's renowned Hospital for Sick Children is being criticized for funding an autism conference whose organizers champion the discredited belief that childhood immunization causes the neurological disorder.</p>
<p>The event -- to start on Saturday at the University of Toronto medical sciences building -- also includes presentations that some experts are calling unproven science, promoting such alternative treatments for autism as homeopathy and hyperbaric oxygen chambers.</p>
<p>Organized by the American group AutismOne and Autism Canada, the meeting has received $5,000 in funding from SickKids Foundation, the hospital's fundraising wing.</p>
<p>Blogs designed to expose practitioners of dubious science have railed against the event for the past two months, questioning why a respected health-care institution would offer its support to a group that considers vaccination of children a health risk.</p>
<p>"The name of Sick Kids is worth more to them than the money: it is a stamp of legitimacy," Scott Gavura, a Toronto pharmacist who runs the Skeptic North blog, said in an interview yesterday.</p>
<p>"Sick Kids hospital has some of the world's most renowned autism researchers. I suspect most of them would not be thrilled by the fact that SickKids Foundation is supporting this conference."</p>
<p>Carole Duncan, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said the grant was awarded in May after Autism Canada submitted a detailed application.</p>
<p>"From our perspective, Autism Canada is a reputable organization doing excellent advocacy work in Canada," said Ms. Duncan in an email.</p>
<p>"Based on our experience in working with Autism Canada, their grant application and their reputation, we have no reason to believe the grant is being used for anything other than providing a respectful forum for parents, therapists, doctors, researchers and individuals with autism spectrum disorder."</p>
<p>In an email sent to Mr. Gavura and others who asked about the grant decision, the Foundation also indicated that it takes a "neutral stance" on alternative and complementary health care for children, and has a history of funding it.</p>
<p>The event's organizers were not available for comment yesterday.</p>
<p>AutismOne, one of the co-hosts, is a U.S. group whose website states prominently that "autism is caused by too many vaccines given too soon." The vaccine-autism connection was first promoted in a small 1998 study, but several "large and well-conducted" studies have since unearthed no evidence to support the notion, said Dr. Susan Bryson, a clinical psychologist and autism expert at Dalhousie University.</p>
<p>Dr. Bryson said she did not know enough about the conference to comment directly on the funding decision, but voiced skepticism about at least two of the presentations. One supports the idea of treating autistic children with hyperbaric therapy, where the patient is put inside a locked chamber and delivered a high concentration of oxygen.</p>
<p>Though approved for treatment of problems such as gas bubbles in the bloodstream and carbon-monoxide poisoning, there is no evidence it helps autistic children, said Dr. Bryson. She said she reviewed the last study published on the therapy for autism and found it to be "very poorly conducted."</p>
<p>Another presentation promotes treating the disorder with homeopathy, which uses heavily diluted solutions of miniscule amounts of substances like arsenic. There is little evidence to support its effectiveness in treating any condition, says the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Dr. Bryson said she is unaware of any research supporting its use in autism.</p>
<p>She said it would be wrong to "censor" any new or unusual idea for treating autism, but argued such theories must be examined with scientific rigour, not accepted on limited evidence.</p>
<p>Dr. Stephen Scherer, an autism researcher at Sick Kids Hospital, said he also did not know enough about the conference to comment on it. He did note, however, that one of the presenters was Dr. Evdokia Anagnostou, a "serious" and science-based autism researcher at Toronto's Bloorview Research Institute.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker is Dr. Martha Herbert, a Harvard Medical School neurology professor, and a medical advisor to the Autism Society of America.</p>
<p>When she testified in support of the 2006 lawsuit of a woman who claimed her daughter had contracted autism through mould in an apartment, however, the Massachusetts Superior Court judge rejected her testimony. Her study method appeared to be "a series of deductions based on possibilities, together with a process of elimination," concluded Justice Judith Fabricant.</p>
<p>"Clearly, Dr. Herbert's method is not generally accepted in the scientific community," she said.</p>
<p>"Dr. Herbert's theory of environmental triggers of autism may some day prove true. It has not yet."</p>

<p>AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani has confirmed that former England captain David Beckham would again join the club in the January transfer window.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Galaxy player arrived at the Serie A club on a similar deal earlier this year, playing out the second half of the season before returning to the Galaxy.</p>
<p>"I've never spoken about buying players in January," said Galliani. "However, someone will arrive in January, a great boost for our midfield. He's an English player, his first name is David, you can try to guess what his surname is.</p>
<p>"It's practically certain at 100 per cent, the only thing missing is the signatures, but the agreement is complete."</p>
<p>During last season's stint at Milan, Beckham played 18 league matches, scoring twice.</p>
<p>Delayed postponement blasted</p>
<p>PARIS -- Clubs blasted the French League after 20 people were injured and 18 arrested in clashes between police and fans following Sunday's postponement of a game between Marseille and Paris St Germain due to H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The two clubs and local authorities were unhappy that league president Frederic Thiriez had waited until Sunday lunchtime to postpone that evening's match when 2,000 PSG supporters were already on the streets of Marseille. Several PSG players had been diagnosed with H1N1 flu and the rest of the Ligue 1 team were quarantined.</p>
<p>"The decision to postpone the game was taken thoughtlessly and too late," said Marseille chairman Jean-Claude Dassier. Soon after the League decision was announced, Marseille and PSG fans clashed near the Vieux Port, in the historical centre. Police fired tear gas and baton charged, needing several hours to restore peace.</p>

<p>Manager Sam Allardyce said three players had contracted the virus, including Chris Samba and David Dunn who both missed Saturday's 5-0 drubbing at Chelsea.</p>
<p>Premier League rules do not allow clubs to call off matches because of outbreaks of swine flu following guidelines issued earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Totti out for undetermined recovery</p>
<p>ROME -- Roma captain Francesco Totti has had a minor operation on his troublesome right knee and his recovery time is uncertain, the Serie A club reported.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old striker suffered cruciate ligament damage in April last year and underwent major surgery. His knee continued to cause him problems last season though and he has missed the last two league games after suffering discomfort.</p>
<p>"No other tears were found in the course of the surgery," Roma said in a statement, adding it was too early to say when he might play again.</p>

<p>In response to federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, I'd love to have my family inoculated with the H1N1 flu vaccine but I want some reassurances first.</p>
<p>Exactly what went into evaluating the vaccine? I've read only a very small Belgian trial was done.</p>
<p>Which part of the international community besides the Belgian tests shared its clinical data and work with us? And was it for the exact, same vaccine we're using?</p>
<p>I've searched but cannot find any medical evidence that vouches for the safety of this vaccine in the race to get it out there. Where can I find that? And I'm looking for data from others besides the drug companies that manufactured this vaccine. We all know such information is not always accurate (thinking thalidomide here).</p>
<p>We need more than "trust us" when you are vaccinating millions of people with this -- we're talking about our children here. I am doing my best to become an informed consumer. Please show me where to look for that info.</p>

<p>We've repeatedly read that swine flu is coming, but now that it has apparently arrived, the vaccine is only just showing up in Canada.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Japan have been giving vaccinations for some time and the U.K. will start this week.</p>
<p>Apparently health officials expect the flu to be in full force in Vancouver by the time vaccinations start the first week of November. Can we blame the wait on the federal government regulatory approval? Even so, the vaccine is only arriving now. It seems the government has spent more time on TV hand-washing commercials in its preparation.</p>

<p>Pregnant women are doing a lot of soul-searching these days about whether to take the controversial H1N1 flu vaccine or not.</p>
<p>The women are not only at high risk from the virus, their decisions will affect the health of their unborn children.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities say six per cent of all H1N1 fatalities have been among pregnant women.</p>
<p>Tara Vello</p>
<p>Yes 4</p>
<p>Not all pregnant mothers are having difficulty with the decision to take the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>For Surrey mom Tara Vello, a health-care worker who sees a lot of illness, the choice was easy.</p>
<p>"I'm worried, working around all these sick people," Vello said Monday.</p>
<p>"Other pregnant ladies I've talked to are worried about 10 years down the road. I'm more worried about now -- my daughter being born during a pandemic.</p>
<p>"The complications can be quite scary. You hear about people being put on respirators and there aren't enough of them," she said.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old mom, who is 31 weeks along with her second girl, is comfortable with a personal trust in vaccines as a medical tool and her sense of the research that has been done.</p>
<p>Information on the Public Health Agency of Canada website [www.publichealth.gc.ca[http://www.publichealth.gc.ca]] was particularly helpful.</p>
<p>"It goes through everything, including information for pregnant mothers," she said.</p>
<p>However, Vello admitted it was "bothersome" that more research hasn't been done with pregnant women.</p>
<p>"[But] it doesn't change my mind," she said.</p>
<p>Advice from the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada has been for pregnant women to get the shot as soon as vaccines are available. Vello's doctor agrees.</p>
<p>"She told me the risks if I get the vaccine were one in a million. She said the risks of a baby catching H1N1 and getting complications were one in 100. B.C.'s infection rates are high. It is much safer to get the shot,"</p>
<p>Vello said.</p>
<p>She received the vaccine Monday and, for good measure, got the seasonal flu vaccine in the other arm.</p>
<p>"I get a flu shot every year. It's better to be safe than not. The shots will take 10 days to three weeks to kick in. I'll keep wearing a mask at work and put jelly on my hands.</p>
<p>"The health of my family is No. 1. I don't want to see them get really sick," she said.</p>
<p>Charran Waldref</p>
<p>Unsure</p>
<p>Pregnant mom Charran Waldref is not usually "paranoid," but she's fearful of what the H1N1 flu virus could do to her unborn twins.</p>
<p>"For some reason, this year's H1N1 really bothers me. I'm not a paranoid person. I'm a reasonable person. My own reaction has surprised me," Waldref, 29, said Monday.</p>
<p>Her impending motherhood, which should be a joyous time, has been weighed down with advice from family, medical reports and her own sense of "caution" in the face of the unknown.</p>
<p>She is at risk of premature labour, which has added to the tension, and has been sequestered at her Vancouver townhouse to await the twins' arrival in 10 weeks' time.</p>
<p>"I don't feel I've been informed enough to make an educated choice. Nobody has told me the vaccine won't induce pre-term labour," she said.</p>
<p>"What will the impact be on unborn fetuses? How can the government know absolutely 100 per cent?" she asked.</p>
<p>According to U.S. health authorities, H1N1 has been fatal for an unexpectedly high proportion of pregnant mothers.</p>
<p>Six per cent of deaths in the U.S. have been among pregnant women, who make up a tiny percentage of the population.</p>
<p>Waldref, who is in financial sales, said the media has contributed to her anxiety by "sensationalizing" the story.</p>
<p>"They point out all the negative things, especially on television," she said.</p>
<p>"I normally get a seasonal flu shot because I'm asthmatic. I'm not not adverse to drugs. I take antibiotics," she said.</p>
<p>"My family really wants me to get it. They think it's a no-brainer, but it's not that easy," she said.</p>
<p>"My primary concern is the kids. I will do whatever is best for them."</p>
<p>She will make her decision later this week when she sees her obstetrician.</p>
<p>"She has been following my pregnancy. I will trust no one other than her.</p>
<p>"I don't want to be a statistic," she said.</p>

<p>Re: Flu vaccine on its way (SP, Oct. 20). Not only is there "not a lot of clinical data on the use of adjuvanted vaccines in pregnant women," there is not a lot of information on adjuvanted influenza vaccines in general.</p>
<p>The seasonal flu vaccines in Canada do not contain adjuvants. The H1N1 vaccines being used in the United States, with 10 times the population of Canada, are non-adjuvanted.</p>
<p>While Health Canada has refused to disclose the adjuvant being used, the H1N1 vaccine being supplied in Canada by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> apparently contains squalene in a water/oil emulsion as an adjuvant. The use of this type of adjuvant (such as in experimental vaccines during the Gulf War) is controversial; it may increase the risk for chronic inflammation and auto-immune responses.</p>
<p>There has been no experience with its use in flu vaccines in North America. Thus the concern of the regulators about the safety and efficacy issues surrounding same. If the H1N1 flu vaccine had been produced in identical fashion to the seasonal flu vaccines, such hypercautionary measures would not be necessary.</p>
<p>Any medical treatment requires informed consent. With the Canadian H1N1 vaccine, informed consent requires a leap of faith. Caveat patiens. (Let the patient beware.)</p>

at the Parkridge Centre and continuing today with clinics at
Saskatoon's three hospitals. The region's deputy medical health
officer, Dr. Ross Findlater, said the goal is for all health region
employees to get the shot for this fall's expected second wave of

</div><div>SHARON KIRKEY    </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>439 words</div><div>26 October 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>As the nation embarks on an unprecedented mass immunization campaign, Canadian doctors consulted by the World Health Organization say shortness of breath is emerging as a hallmark sign of potentially critical H1N1 infection.</p>
<p>Experts have been struggling to understand why what is an uncomplicated illness for most people can be severe or fatal in others, and whether there is any way of predicting who is at risk of becoming critically sick with human swine flu.</p>
<p>Now they believe they have a sign.</p>
<p>"Influenza does a lot of things to a lot of people, but the one thing it should never do to anybody is make you short of breath," said Dr. Anand Kumar, with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, who specializes in the care of critically ill patients.</p>
<p>"That's a danger signal for everybody," Kumar said. "If you are short of breath, that means you need urgent assessment by a physician or by the emergency room.</p>
<p>"That would allow therapy early enough to hopefully prevent it from becoming a severe case."</p>
<p>Kumar was among a contingent of Canadian doctors who participated in an expert advisory meeting convened by the WHO this month to develop updated guidance documents on the clinical picture and management of H1N1 disease.</p>
<p>Those guidelines are expected to be released this week.</p>
<p>Data presented at the meeting suggest one-half to three-quarters of those who get severe H1N1 are relatively healthy.</p>
<p>"Because the general recommendations are that people with mild disease don't have to be treated, the question then becomes, if you're relatively healthy, when do you seek medical care?" Kumar said. "If you shouldn't treat everybody, when do you start taking anti-virals?"</p>
<p>"I think we all feel that if you're not improving by the third day, if you haven't plateaued or you're getting worse by Day 3 or 4, it's time to go in and see a doctor, and they should consider the possibility of anti-viral therapy."</p>
<p>Symptoms of H1N1 are the same for regular seasonal flu and include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue.</p>
<p>"But those are the obvious ones," Kumar said. "The one that we were most concerned people would overlook is shortness of breath."</p>
<p>In severe cases, people have deteriorated rapidly and gone into respiratory failure with 24 hours.</p>
<p>The first batches of the H1N1 vaccine will be released across Canada this week in what will ultimately become the largest immunization campaign in the nation's history</p>

<p>CORNWALL, Ont.</p>
<p>Preteen dies in hospital</p>
<p>from H1N1 virus</p>
<p>A preteen who died in hospital this weekend marks the first Cornwall-area fatality from the second wave of the H1N1 flu. The child was admitted to an Ottawa hospital on Friday and died over the weekend. Medical Officer of Health Dr. Paul Roumeliotis says he doesn't believe the preteen had any underlying health problems. The death comes days after the province's top medical official confirmed the second wave of the pandemic H1N1 flu has arrived in Ontario, with 29 deaths and 31 people currently in hospital.</p>
<p>VANCOUVER</p>
<p>Man arrested after five people stabbed over a half-hour</p>
<p>Vancouver police have arrested a 30-year-old man accused of going on a half-hour stabbing rampage. On Saturday evening at the busy intersection of East Broadway and Commercial Drive, a man was stabbed in the back. The man then stabbed a person every few blocks over the next half-hour. All victims suffered non-life threatening injuries and have been treated in hospital. None of the victims knew the man and the motive for the attacks is under investigation.</p>

<p>in gym lot before driving off</p>
<p>In a display that looked more like something from a demolition derby than a parking attempt, the driver of the <span class="companylink">BMW</span> SUV failed to brake after pulling into a parking spot at a gym in Thornhill. After driving up onto the hoods of two cars, the SUV driver reversed and then drove away. One of the vehicles was a rental being used by a tourist, but the other belonged to the gym's information technology specialist, who says he couldn't believe what he was seeing when he replayed the security tapes.</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Parents face charges for plan to take kids to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Police say a Toronto couple will likely face abduction charges for allegedly trying to fly to Hong Kong after fleeing to B.C. with their children during a court-appointed visit Saturday. The six-year-old boy and five-year-old girl were reported missing Saturday when they did not return to their foster parents' Toronto home after an unsupervised two-hour visit with their parents. Police found the children with their parents early Sunday in the Vancouver suburb of Richmond. The Children's Aid Society was planning to end all visits later this week. The parents were preparing to fly to Hong Kong on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>FOGO ISLAND, N.L.</p>
<p>Police recover two bodies after men reported missing</p>
<p>A search for a pair of bird hunters in waters off Fogo Island, N.L., ended in tragedy Sunday with the recovery of the bodies of two men, aged 47 and 50. A military helicopter, two coast guard vessels and a vessel from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans were involved in the search. The two men were reported overdue when they failed to return home after leaving in a small fibreglass boat to go bird hunting early Saturday. The weather was very bad on Saturday, police said.</p>
<p>MONTREAL</p>
<p>Girl, 14, dies after cars</p>
<p>full of teens leave party</p>
<p>A 14-year-old girl died early Sunday and a 15-year-old boy is in hospital in critical condition after a two-car collision in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que. Four other teenagers were also injured. They were packed into a Kia Rio hatchback and driving home from a party along with five other teenagers in a second car. The two cars collided as the drivers tried to pass each other on a country road and the Kia spun into a ravine, hitting several trees before crashing. The girl was thrown from the vehicle. Police blame speed and recklessness, not alcohol, for the crash. The five passengers in the second car escaped injury.</p>

<p>Damien Bertozzi and Izabelle Wrobel are wrestling with what to do about the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Bertozzi, 27, knows he won't be getting it, but Wrobel, 28, is still on the fence.</p>
<p>And the couple haven't yet decided what will be best for their two-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>The pair is concerned the vaccine, which has been generated in a matter of months, may not be safe. Wrobel points out how in the past, side effects have been found much later down the road.</p>
<p>"If we knew for sure that it was safe and it was going to prevent it, of course we would," Bertozzi said.</p>
<p>The couple aren't alone in feeling the vaccine may not be the best solution for the new strain of flu.</p>
<p>Several people The Spectator talked to said they had no intention of getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>"I don't plan on getting it just because I don't feel the need to," said Angel McCann, 18.</p>
<p>McCann said she's got friends who've had H1N1 and if she does get sick "then most likely I will recover from it."</p>
<p>The province recently confirmed the second wave of H1N1 has arrived in Ontario. Yesterday, it was announced a preteen in the Cornwall area died on the weekend after being admitted to hospital Friday.</p>
<p>There have been 29 deaths in the province and there are 31 people in hospital linked to the flu.</p>
<p>In Hamilton, vaccination clinics will start today, with specific groups of people being eligible for the shot. But that doesn't mean everyone will take advantage of it.</p>
<p>For Steve MacDonald, 32, the threat just isn't there.</p>
<p>"The media perpetuates things that aren't really a threat," he said.</p>
<p>"It's not really a concern. I'm not old. I'm not sick."</p>
<p>Stephanie Legere, 29, and her son, 5, don't want the shot.</p>
<p>"A flu is a flu as long as you take care of it in the proper manner," she said.</p>
<p>Ken McKenzie, 42, also plans to skip the vaccine for himself and his five-year-old son. He said every time his son gets the regular flu shot he's sick for a week or more. Last year, he left out the shot, and the illness.</p>
<p>"I get sick, I get sick, I guess," he said.</p>
<p>But there are some who have no bones about getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>Beverly Ward, 63, works with the public in both her jobs and also lives with her 86-year-old father whom she does not want to get H1N1.</p>
<p>Ward doubts the vaccine would be available for use if it weren't safe.</p>
<p>"I'd rather ... get it and hope for the best than not get it and get the swine flu," she said.</p>
<p>Terry McCabe, 63, will also be getting a shot because of her underlying health issues. And she does think people are taking the flu seriously enough.</p>
<p>"If they're not, they should be," she cautioned.</p>

<p>AT A GLANCE</p>
<p>* 29 deaths in Ontario linked to H1N1.</p>

<p>Will you get the shot?</p>

</p>
<p>Gilbert Brule didn't have the stomach for playing when the flu bug hit him for six days, but the centre dragged himself out of bed on Sunday to rejoin the Edmonton Oilers against the Vancouver Canucks.</p>
<p>"It wasn't H1N1, just the regular flu. I was achy all over my body ... had some headaches from dehydration and a bad stomach," said Brule, who got sick just before he was to play the same Canucks at Rexall Place last Monday. It was only hours after an army of Vancouver media folks conducted long feel-good interviews with him at the morning skate because he was off to a hot start-- seven points in his first seven games -- and he had played junior for the WHL's Vancouver Giants.</p>
<p>"I had my pre-game nap, woke up and was exhausted. It lasted until Saturday night and I got the green light (Sunday)morning to fly here," said Brule, who was bummed out that he couldn't play Thursday against his old club, the Columbus Blue Jackets.</p>
<p>"I really wanted to get back for that one ... but we'll get another chance at them(on Nov. 16)."</p>
<p>He hadn't stpped on a scale to see if he'd lost any weight, but not playing was eating away at him.</p>
<p>MacIntyre goes distance</p>
<p>According to hockeyfights.com,Steve MacIntyre's fight with Calgary Flames tough guy Brian McGrattan lasted over a minute, an eternity for a scrap with little or no wrestling.</p>
<p>McGrattan landed several heavy punches early, knocking the Oilers heavy's helmet askew, before MacIntyre came on later.</p>
<p>It was the first shift for both guys, 3-1/2 minutes into the game. The Oilers coaching staff would rather MacIntyre have played longer before dropping the gloves, and they're not crazy about fights that don't result from retribution on the ice. But nobody at the Saddledome was hiding their eyes when it started. The linesmen stood back and let them fire away.</p>
<p>"My dad tells me I have to learn to win fights in the first half of them," said MacIntyre. "Or I have to duck a few early punches. He caught me with a couple, for sure.</p>
<p>"He (McGrattan) asked me, Aare you done?' I told him, 'Settle down here, this fight will go as long as I want.' I wasn't going to let him off the hook. But he's a pretty tough guy."</p>
<p>McGrattan later wanted to go with Zack Stortini, who was in Jarome Iginla's grille, but MacIntyre wasn't going to let that happen. Stortini was playing too well, and irritating the Flames.</p>
<p>"I told him, 'I'm your knuckle-berry,'" MacIntyre said with a laugh. He played 51 seconds on the night; McGrattan logged 64 seconds.</p>
<p>Calgary leads the NHL with 13 fighting majors. The Oilers were second going into Sunday's game, with 10.</p>
<p>Scare for Jacques</p>
<p>Oilers winger J.F. Jacques got a scare in the first period in Calgary when Flames defenceman Dion Phaneuf's fell and his skate blade cut into Jacques' right wrist. The cut was about four inches long.</p>
<p>"Got six stitches. Luckily, it didn't cut anything," said Jacques.</p>
<p>The medical staff was concerned that he could have his tendon slashed, which would have been a major problem.</p>
<p>Wellwood breaks toe</p>
<p>Vancouver centre Kyle Wellwood, who almost tied the Oilers with a rink-long dash in the last half-dozen seconds last Monday in Edmonton, didn't play in the rematch Sunday. He broke the big toe on his right foot on Saturday when Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Mike Komisarek nailed him with a shot off his boot cap in the third period of the Canucks' 3-1 win.</p>
<p>Wellwood didn't miss a shift, but after taking his skate off at game's end, his foot was throbbing, and they found a crack.</p>
<p>"I had no clue when the shot first hit me. Funny thing about hockey players. You can always keep playing," said Wellwood, who will be out of action for three weeks.</p>
<p>Schneider finally plays</p>
<p>After six months off, much-travelled defenceman Mathieu Schneider played his first game for the Canucks. He was signed as a free agent over the summer after finishing last season with the Montreal Canadiens.</p>
<p>Schneider damaged his shoulder against Toronto with five games left in the season, and needed surgery, which was not done until after the playoffs.</p>
<p>"I got it shot up with painkillers to play against the Bruins, but it was difficult. It got worse after two games (of the four-game Boston sweep)," he said.</p>
<p>Canucks associate head coach Rick Bowness is getting Schneider, who is playing for his ninth NHL team, for a second time. Bowness was head man for a short time with the New York Islanders a dozen years ago.</p>
<p>"He got traded to the Leafs with Wendel Clark for Kenny Jonsson and some others," said Bowness.</p>
<p>One of those others was a first-round draft choice that the Isles turned into Roberto Luongo, before Luongo was dealt to the Florida Panthers, then to Vancouver.</p>

</p>
<p>Liverpool beat Manchester United 2-0 to end its four-game losing streak and keep Chelsea at the top of the Premier League yesterday, while Arsenal and Manchester City threw away two-goal leads and were held to draws.</p>
<p>Arsenal tied West Ham 2-2 but still moved ahead of Tottenham into third place, while Clint Dempsey's equalizer gave Fulham a 2-2 tie with Man City.</p>
<p>Goals by Fernando Torres and David Ngog earned Liverpool its third straight Premier League victory over Manchester United, which has become its closest rival and last season tied its record 18 league title triumphs.</p>
<p>"The players have answered a lot of questions and that's the most important thing," Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez said. "We have to keep going. We can't get too excited about today."</p>
<p>United's second defeat means it is two points behind Chelsea. Liverpool moved up three spots to fifth.</p>
<p>Dempsey headed home Jonathan Greening's free kick in the 68th minute to deny Man City the win at City of Manchester Stadium and prevent the home side climbing to third.</p>
<p>City appeared in control after strikes by Joleon Lescott (53rd) and Martin Petrov (60th). But Damien Duff replied in the 62nd and Dempsey knotted the score.</p>
<p>"At 2-0 up, we should see the game off," Man City manager Mark Hughes said. "We acknowledged before the game that Dempsey was a good header of a ball and told the guys, but we allowed him to score."</p>
<p>First-half goals by Robin van Persie and William Gallas gave Arsenal a lead at next-to-last West Ham, but Carlton Cole and Alessandro Diamanti forced the tie.</p>
<p>Arsenal still moved to third above Tottenham, which lost 1-0 at home to Stoke on Saturday. The Gunners also have a game in hand on Tottenham and Liverpool.</p>
<p>GERMANY</p>
<p>Ten-man Hamburger SV forced a 3-3 tie at Schalke to move into a tie with Bayer Leverkusen atop the Bundesliga. In other games yesterday, Werder Bremen rallied for a 4-1 win in Bochum and last-place Hertha Berlin ended an eight-game skid by holding champion Wolfsburg to a 0-0 draw.</p>
<p>SPAIN</p>
<p>Barcelona routed Zaragoza 6-1 to move three points ahead of Real Madrid at the top of the Primera Liga, helped by a Seydou Keita hat trick and two goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Goals from David Villa, Pablo Hernandez and Juan Manuel Mata gave Valencia a 3-0 win over 10-man Almeria, taking the side up to fourth place in the standings. Villarreal beat Malaga 2-1 to win its first game of the season and move off the bottom of the table.</p>
<p>FRANCE</p>
<p>Ireneusz Jelen scored twice as Auxerre rallied to beat Lille 3-2, while struggling Lens slumped to a fourth consecutive loss with a 2-0 home defeat by Toulouse. Paris Saint-Germain's match at Marseille was postponed. The decision came after a third PSG player was diagnosed with swine flu. No new date for the game has been decided.</p>
<p>ITALY</p>
<p>Juventus won 1-0 in Siena to keep pressure on Serie A pacesetters Inter Milan and Sampdoria. Juventus striker Amauri headed home a free kick taken by Diego to secure the points. AC Milan needed a brace from defender Alessandro Nesta in the last 10 minutes to take the points from Chievo Verona.</p>
<p>SCOTLAND</p>
<p>First-half goals by Shaun Maloney and Scott McDonald gave Celtic a 2-1 victory at Hamilton and helped the club move back on top of the Scottish Premier League. Celtic's sixth victory in nine games means the team has 20 points. Defending champion Rangers, unbeaten with five wins and four draws, has 19.</p>
<p>NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>FC Twente beat FC Groningen 4-0 to stay atop the Dutch league and extend its unbeaten run to 11 games, while Ajax beat defending champion AZ Alkmaar 4-2 to move into second place in the standings..</p>

<p>I've been fighting a cold for some days now, fighting it with OJ and hot tea, with vitamin C and taking it easy; as usual, the cold is winning.</p>
<p>In a departure from the usual, though, I'm mad about this cold. Mad at the red-nosed woman in the seat behind me on the train from Ottawa to Montreal last week, who took time out from coughing her way through the two-hour trip only to blow her nose as she tapped away at her laptop.</p>
<p>Mad at the waiter in the hotel breakfast room in Ottawa who sneezed all over the coffee station. Mad at the girl sitting to my left on a jammed airplane the week before that for wiping her dripping nose with her sleeve all the way down to Orlando. And mad at colleagues who don't think that coughing up mucus is something they should do in the privacy of their own homes.</p>
<p>I never used to feel this aggressive toward people for being out and about with their cold or flu viruses. But I've been laid low too often by what I take to be a complete absence of consideration on their part.</p>
<p>And the reporting these past months about the H1N1 pandemic, I confess, has turned me into a more frightened, cautious version of myself. I envision germs dispersing through the droplets in people's sneezes and coughs and wish I could duck them. I wash my hands so often the skin is raw, use alcohol-based sanitizer furiously and keep my hands away from my face to try and keep germs from spreading. An email on H1N1 prevention making the rounds counsels twice-daily gargles with warm salt water, and I can't see the harm in that. Before too long, I expect to have the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>I get that people think others depend on them and that they have to turn up at work even when they're sick. But I believe that they're wrong, that they'd be surprised by the length of the list of co-workers who, like me, would prefer that they stayed home.</p>
<p>Some people don't have paid sick days, I know, or are afraid of losing their jobs if they don't report for work. Seems to me that going to work with a plugged head and taking on the risk of getting even sicker or infecting those around you is pretty short-sighted. Still, bills and fear are powerful motivators; if I were in either of those camps, I confess I might consider working sick, too.</p>
<p>Yet many who choose to go into work even when they're under the weather are people whose jobs are in no danger, people who would be paid, anyway. Recent surveys have shown many people say they frequently go to work when they feel sick. Results of a poll made public this month, for instance, show that more than 25 per cent of Quebecers surveyed said they would continue to go to work if they had the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Andrew Simor, head of microbiology and infectious diseases at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, said the poll illustrates a workplace culture that rewards a work-at-all-costs attitude - and discourages people from taking sick time.</p>
<p>"I don't think organizations as a whole have done an awful lot to emphasize the importance of the healthy workplace - quite the opposite," he said. "The history and the culture we have is that you're a bit of a wimp if you take time off from work because you're sick. ... In light of the pandemic, I think people should be re-thinking that."</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I used to be one of those people. I thought staying home was a sign of weakness, believed there was something commendable about going to work even though I really wanted to be at home, under a blanket, drinking hot tea with honey. An exaggerated sense of obligation, prompted, perhaps, by an inflated perception of my value to the organization, was one reason, I suspect; as well, I was reluctant to take into account the potential effect of my actions on others in my sphere.</p>
<p>No longer. I see clearly now that we're not nearly as productive when we work sick, that there's a better-than-good chance we'll set into motion a cycle that risks making the people around us ill.  And generous as I like to think I am as a person, I'm thinking nobody wants me to be generous with my germs.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Risks of H1N1 vaccine are minor, compared with getting the virus</b>
</div><div>Jill Vihos   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>345 words</div><div>26 October 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Health Canada's recent approval of the H1N1 vaccine has been welcomed with a mixed reception.</p>
<p>While it is important to ask questions about the safety of the vaccine, it is equally vital to trust the process and recognize that surveillance and testing of the H1N1 vaccine is ongoing.</p>
<p>All medical interventions involve some degree of risk. However, increasing death rates from the H1N1 virus should be proof enough that H1N1 presents a significant danger to populations and the benefits of receiving the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with contracting the disease.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that skeptics do not recognize the commendable work and co-ordination that the federal government, the pharmaceutical industry and health agencies have executed in rapidly responding to H1N1. Producing a vaccine in a timely manner has unquestionably posed an insurmountable challenge, which has been met.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, we are fortunate to have vaccines available to reduce the spread, and prevent death from infectious diseases. In today's rapidly changing information age, it is easy to forget history and recognize that prior to the innovation of vaccines in the 20th century, infectious diseases attributed to millions of deaths a year worldwide.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, we are privileged to live in a country that values freedom of both opinion and choice. However, with respect to the known risk that H1N1 poses to the general population, perhaps it is time to be more egalitarian in our thinking and acknowledge that it may be socially responsible to get the H1N1 vaccine to protect others, as well as ourselves.</p>
<p>While it is a reality that adverse effects of H1N1 vaccine remain undiscovered, we must acknowledge that all facets of our lives will always be governed by fear of the unknown.</p>
<p>With regard to the H1N1 vaccine, perhaps it is more advantageous to take a "leap of faith" and recognize that the risks from the vaccine are less than the dire consequences from contracting the virus.</p>

<div>878 words</div><div>26 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Every day in Ottawa, we can safely assume at least one person falls through the cracks. It's an apt description, that phrase "falling through the cracks," of the way trouble can grab someone and pull them down and out, faster than anyone can throw out a hand and catch them. It's a daily happening in any city and no doubt, as you read this, a fellow citizen, due to circumstances over which he or she has no real control, is feeling that falling sensation.</p>
<p>It is also true that some parts of the city have more cracks than others. Overbrook, for example, has Rockcliffe beat hands down for fissures. The true measure of a city is how it administers compassion in those sections of town where the cracks congregate, and in the neighbourhood of Overbrook-Forbes, the administration of compassion is focused around the Community Resource Centre. (The neighbourhood is in Rideau ward, which includes Overbrook, New Edinburgh and Rockcliffe. As wards go it's a study in contrasts that, working in gross generalizations, steps down the income brackets and rises in its multi-cultural contingent as you move south. The main language in the southern half, and the working language of the community centre, is French.)</p>
<p>The 26-year-old centre is housed in a red-brick, square-box ex-school on Donald Street, at number 225, next to the church that is its landlord. Last year, because a health centre was moving in, dovetailing with the many services already packed into the building, the centre was renovated, and it shows. Fresh unmarked paint in non-institutional mustard and blue, art from the community on the walls, everywhere a feeling of ready-for-you.</p>
<p>On my visit there last week, I arrived about an hour before the afternoon rush, which these days is when people come in to avail themselves of the emergency food cupboard. Over the summer of recession we all just went through, the number of impoverished people seeking basic nourishment -- many of them families with several kids -- doubled, and they plug the foyer of the centre for several hours during distribution. Food cupboards and food banks in Canada should be an oxymoron, but they aren't, quite the opposite; they are increasingly imbedded, which is a sad, politically shameful fact.</p>
<p>First, I had an orientating chat with the executive director, Catherine, who arrived at her desk in July. There was mention, as the centre is principally funded with city taxpayer dollars, of the impending budget deliberations, which promise to be quieter than usual this time around (perhaps) but are always a nervous time for executive directors on the compassion-delivery side of city affairs, and Catherine has a set of good-fortune beads permanently dangling from her door handle. As she lists the centre's myriad services, I need all my fingers and toes to count the number of programs on offer in the hive of rooms around us.</p>
<p>Moving through the hive, one witnesses diversity of approach in dealing with a very diverse neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Here are a gang of volunteers getting the parcels ready for the Emergency Food Program, apples and canned goods and cereals and rows and stacks of comestibles filling a room with what feel like rations for the troops, which perhaps they are; and everything that goes out today will need replenishing by tomorrow. Here are a circle of parents and their small kids at play; nearby the breastfeeding consultant is talking to a mother who has dropped in. In the after-school drop-in room and site of the homework club, a dozen or so pumpkins are being sprayed gold as decorations for the upcoming Masquerade Ball. Over here plans are being made for the next walking club outing for seniors. Someone is cooking something spicy in the community kitchen. The staff of the Family Health Team are indeed busy bees, gearing up to distribute the H1N1 vaccine, which task hangs over health services everywhere like a hurricane warning.</p>
<p>In a softly lit office, a crisis intervention officer is listening to a man whose hands sketch out the crisis in the air as he talks. In another office a calm, tireless man working in the "Overbrook -- It all starts with you" program, which is running a pilot scheme in a socially challenged housing co-op, greets a resident with, "Bonjour, ma belle" and they commence talking in earnest even before sitting down. Smiles and frowns, more of the former than the latter, fill the other rooms as the day progresses. Meanwhile, the anti-poverty co-ordinator who is based here is out at the moment, abroad in the city, advocating for the assuagement of the true epidemic that beggars any community -- inequity.</p>
<p>So it goes, the daily administering of compassion in a centre in a city where, not three miles away, several hundred casualties of corporate misadministration and greed are rallying to try and save their pensions. And now, the Emergency Food Program rush begins, people filing quietly into the building, holding their dignity intact as they look down into the cracks and try not to fall in.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pressing the flesh taboo at convocation; Graduates improvise as fear of spreading flu puts an end to traditional handshake</b>

</p>
<p>As a former politician who has shaken countless hands, University of Ottawa president Allan Rock stood on stage Sunday and tried to control his compulsion to grasp another 1,400.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the fall convocation ceremonies, Rock warned this year's graduates that neither he nor university chancellor Huguette Labelle would shake their hands when they came on stage at the National Arts Centre to accept their degrees.</p>
<p>Rock says he was advised by officials that pressing so much flesh would be an excellent way to spread H1N1 flu virus among graduates.</p>
<p>And so it was that curtseys, winks, salutes, respectful nods and Obama-style fist bumps replaced the conventional hand clasp.</p>
<p>"I have a huge instinct to stick my hand out wherever I am and say 'Hi, how are you'?" Rock said later.</p>
<p>At times he felt like the film character Dr. Strangelove, who must hold down his mechanical arm to keep from saluting, he said.</p>
<p>But without the gesture, Rock says the brief moment on stage with each graduate was a bit more meaningful.</p>
<p>"A handshake is a way to shuffle people through," he said. "If there's no handshake, they stop and say, 'what we do now?' If we ask them a question, it's more likely to result in an actual exchange."</p>
<p>Jethro Constant, a six-foot-three football player graduating in physiotherapy, gave Rock a full-on chest bump of the kind typically seen on NFL sidelines.</p>
<p>"He was cool about it," Constant said.</p>
<p>After so many graduates before him simply nodded, a friend dared Alexander Leslie to give Rock an elbow bump.</p>
<p>"I felt he was getting bored up there," said Leslie, graduating with a masters of business administration. He went in with elbows up like Gordie Howe. Rock and Labelle played along.</p>
<p>Leslie said he believes fears about H1N1 are overblown and that the precaution was "a load of crap."</p>
<p>Krista Johnson, graduating with a masters in human kinetics, said her brief moment on stage with the two university officials was a bit uncomfortable without the handshake.</p>
<p>"There was social awkwardness," she said. "It was definitely a missing piece."</p>
<p>But Lisa Cohen, also an MA graduate in human kinetics, said she understood the need to cut the shakes.</p>
<p>"We really don't want to be spreading bugs around."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Doctors question ethics of needles for children</b>
</div><div>Tom Blackwell </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>814 words</div><div>26 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>With Canada on the brink of one of its largest-ever vaccination drives, a group of academics and doctors is urging health-care workers to make flu and other shots less painful for children, suggesting it is actually "unethical " for them to ignore the sting of injections.</p>
<p>Many doctors and parents believe a needle is nothing to</p>
<p>fret about, with the hurt lasting only a moment</p>
<p>and leaving no long-term effects, the researchers acknowledge in a series of medical-journal papers just published.</p>
<p>Using one of several possible pain-reduction techniques, however, could help avert needle phobias that affect as much as 10% of the population, last years and undermine vaccination campaigns, they argue.</p>
<p>Those methods -- from anesthetic cream applied to the skin to simply giving babies sugar water -- are seldom employed now, the panel says in the journal Clinical Therapeutics.</p>
<p>"The attitude is, 'It's only pain -- what's the big deal?' " said Anna Taddio, a pharmacy professor at the University of Toronto and lead author of the papers. "But it actually is when you start figuring out what all the costs of it are. It means someone is not going to donate blood ... and it means that person doesn't go to see the doctor, doesn't go to see the dentist because they don't want to be poked," she said. "They're probably sicker as a group of people."</p>
<p>The issue is becoming more pressing, given that Canadian children are receiving a constantly expanding range of vaccines --as many as 20 shots by age five -- while uptake on immunization is dropping, the journal articles argue.</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced of the need for widespread action, though. Pain in immunization is undoubtedly a serious issue for a "subset" of children who could benefit from pain-reduction methods, but they are likely the exception, said Dr. Peter Nieman, a Calgary pediatrician. "For the majority of kids I've seen, it's a trade-off," he said. "On the one hand, nobody in their right mind would say, 'I love needles,' but on the other hand, the pain you put up with is a small price to pay for the benefit you get."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Prof. Taddio's group, including pharmacists, physicians and pain researchers, is developing a formal practice guideline around vaccine-pain reduction that it hopes the Canadian Pediatric Society will adopt for its members soon.</p>
<p>There is also a movement to have pain reported as one of the adverse side effects of vaccine injections, which might encourage pharmaceutical companies to produce vaccines that hurt less, Prof. Taddio said. Some formulations are already less painful than others, a function of the chemicals used and how they interact with human tissue.</p>
<p>As a physician and pharmacologist in the emergency department of a London, Ont., hospital, Dr. Michael Rieder says he sees the impact of pain-induced needle fear "all the time," with older children and even teenagers recoiling at the approach of a hypodermic, whether it is to draw blood or inject local anesthetic.</p>
<p>"One of the biggest problems in pediatric acute care is fear of needles," he said. "If you have to draw blood and the child is struggling and fighting because they're afraid of a needle, it's not such an easy thing to do."</p>
<p>The group's review of evidence cites studies that suggest 90% of toddlers and 50% of school-age children experience severe distress during vaccination, with some evidence that early bad experiences can condition bodies to be more sensitive to pain in future.</p>
<p>About one in 10 people is estimated to have full-blown needle phobia, and 25% of adults to have significant fears, prompting them to avoid dental visits, fail to donate blood and neglect insulin injections, the researchers say.</p>
<p>In one study of 12,000 people, only 12% agreed to undergo a free flu vaccine, and virtually all of them chose a nasal spray instead of a needle, many of them citing the pain of injection for their decision.</p>
<p>In fact, recent polls suggest that only a third of Canadians plan to get the H1N1 vaccine, and Prof. Taddio believes memories of childhood immunization pain are likely a reason why some will pass on the shot.</p>
<p>To reduce needle pain, apply topical anesthetic creams; comfort babies by having them breast-feed or suck on sugar water during the shot; and simply distract the child. Doctors and others should also give needles without aspirating, a process designed to ensure they are not injecting vaccine into a blood vessel, Prof. Taddio said. Aspiration prolongs the pain and is not necessary, she said.</p>

<p>It is nice to see your newspaper take on the plight of individual Canadians. An elderly man indirectly killed by heartless bureaucracy, a woman stranded abroad, a man tortured abroad and the occasional abused animal.</p>
<p>Yet when all Canadians are put up against the wall by their own government, nothing happens. There is no outcry, no challenge from our defenders of democracy, law establishment, activists, religious leaders and media.</p>
<p>The Canadian government drew a page from the totalitarianism book when it decided to give legal immunity to manufacturers of H1N1 vaccine should complications arise after the vaccine is administered.</p>

<p>As we are now officially on the second wave of H1N1 flu, I would suggest to parents that they scale down the celebration of halloween. Rather than going to many houses, children should go to only a few houses for trick or treat. This would help prevent the flu from spreading.</p>

<p>Beaten by her drunk, screaming husband, she throws her teenaged daughter out of the house to keep her safe.</p>
<p>In this heart-stopping high school play, the daughter then appears homeless, shivering on a curb. Two guys approach and offer shelter if she "shares something" with them.</p>
<p>Tossing a lost look at the audience, she sighs and then gives in.</p>
<p>Curtain.</p>
<p>"Great work - but you boys need to be more threatening," drama teacher Cameron Ferguson coaches the would-be pimps. "Touch her hair. And speak up when you tell her you know a way that she can make money ..."</p>
<p>In five gritty skits they wrote themselves that will premiere this week, teens at a Markham high school portray some of the reasons people land on the streets as part of an experimental new curriculum developed by York University that is a cornerstone of a new awareness project on homelessness.</p>
<p>The Homeless Hub website, run by York's faculty of education, is believed to be the world's first user-friendly clearing house on homeless issues - including the spread of the H1N1 virus in shelters - from videotaped testimonials to reports from front-line workers and scholarly research made easy to read.</p>
<p>As part of the move to bust stereotypes and boost awareness, York has developed lesson plans on this uneasy topic, plus primers for students themselves. The drama unit was being pilot-tested at Bur Oak Secondary School. Ferguson, who teaches at Bur Oak, helped write the new curriculum.</p>
<p>"Some people think homeless people are all lazy bums, and we didn't know the real causes until we started our research," said student Dania Zargaran, 16, who wrote a skit about a girl who lands on the streets after being rejected by friends and family because she is gay.</p>
<p>She says the class now knows that poverty, homophobia and physical abuse often propel young people onto the streets.</p>
<p>"A high percentage of gay kids become homeless because they get disowned by their families," said the Grade 11 student at the school near McCowan Rd. and 16th Ave.</p>
<p>This is exactly the kind of awareness professor Stephen Gaetz was hoping would come from the project. As associate dean of research in York's teaching faculty, he has overseen the gathering of more than 25,000 items, including podcasts and reading lists, onto the website at www.homelesshub.ca[http://www.homelesshub.ca].</p>
<p>"The reality is, youth are often scared of the homeless because they don't have an understanding of how they got there, yet the homeless are far more likely to be victims of violence than to commit violence," said Gaetz.</p>
<p>"Our role is to seed the public discussion on the issue with facts, rather than stereotypes."</p>
<p>Teachers can find reading lists of books that provide opportunities for a discussion about the homeless, noted York Professor Evelyn Wilson - from The Odyssey to The Grapes of Wrath and even Harry Potter.</p>

</p>
<p>With children at particular risk of H1N1 influenza, members of hockey leagues across the country are being told to shun sports drinks and to avoid sharing water bottles on the bench.</p>
<p>The directive, from Hockey Canada, was drafted last month by the organization's chief medical officer, Dr. Mark Aubry, but is being circulated now to parents of players as the hockey season starts getting into full gear.</p>
<p>Sports drinks are a no-no because the bottles don't have spouts, making direct lip contact with the container more possible, providing a possible transmission route for the highly contagious flu viruses.</p>
<p>Gone are the days when teams would provide water bottles on the bench for all to use. Hockey Canada wants all players and coaches to bring their own and label them with names and player numbers.</p>
<p>In the locker room, players aren't to share towels, clothing, or even soap. Towels should be removed promptly from all benches, and teams are being told to carry extra hand sanitizer, as not all arenas have the prophylactic substance readily available.</p>
<p>Hockey equipment is another possible transmission route, and players should wash their hands after handling skates, gloves and uniforms, according to the directive.</p>

</p>
<p>Responding to a dramatic surge in the number of U.S. swine flu cases, President Barack Obama has signed a proclamation declaring H1N1 influenza a national emergency.</p>
<p>The order by Mr. Obama, announced on the weekend, will speed the ability of hospitals and health authorities to take measures to fight the pandemic through such steps as setting up tents in hospital parking lots to establish extra emergency room care and creating health clinics in school gymnasiums or community centres.</p>
<p>“The rates of illness continue to rise rapidly within many communities across the nation, and the potential exists for the pandemic to overburden health care resources in some locations,” Mr. Obama said in the declaration.</p>
<p>The action comes as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the disease is now widespread in 46 states, a development it calls “unprecedented during seasonal flu,” signalling the sweeping nature of the current outbreak.</p>
<p>The death toll in the U.S. since the end of August of laboratory-confirmed cases of the swine flu is 411, but a factor worrying health experts is that many of the victims are young children. With 53 of the fatalities among the young, about one out of every eight deaths are in those aged 17 and under.</p>
<p>The tally in children is on track to make the outbreak far worse than a normal influenza season in the United States, which typically claims the lives of about 80 young people annually.</p>
<p>The White House said in a statement that the declaration will allow medical centres to deal with a surge in H1N1 patients by allowing, as needed, the waiver of certain federal health requirements.</p>
<p>There have been 8,204 laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations due to the illness.</p>
<p>Tents set up outside of hospitals also offer the advantage of slowing the spread of the virus, by keeping flu-afflicted patients out of regular emergency rooms and wards. If hospitals are overwhelmed by flu cases, the federal proclamation also allows them to collect less patient information to speed up giving treatments.</p>
<p>The pandemic continues to spread around the globe, with the World Health Organization saying it has tracked nearly 414,000 laboratory-confirmed H1N1 cases and nearly 5,000 deaths.</p>

</p>
<p>As the federal government and the provinces begin to roll out their mass vaccination campaign against H1N1 influenza this week, support for the inoculations among Canadians has plunged and the public is deeply divided about the need for the immunizations, according to a new survey.</p>
<p>The online poll, conducted by Strategic Counsel for The Globe and Mail and CTV, found that only 49 per cent of Canadians sampled in October wanted to get the new flu shot, a sharp decline from the 62 per cent who said they would in a survey conducted in July.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, opposition to vaccination has grown sharply, with 51 per cent saying they wouldn't get the shots, up from only 38 per cent in July.</p>
<p>Doubts about vaccination are highest in Quebec, where 59 per cent, or nearly six out of every 10 people, said they didn't want to get the vaccine, followed by Ontario, where the figure was 53 per cent.</p>
<p>The growing opposition highlights the difficulty health officials will have in convincing Canadians they need the shots. It also reflects doubts among a significant part of the population that the vaccines have been fully tested and a belief the influenza outbreak isn't much worse than the common cold, the poll said.</p>
<p>“There has been a real drop-off in the desire to have the vaccination shot, notwithstanding all the government communication urging Canadians to the contrary,” said Tim Woolstencroft, managing partner at Strategic Counsel.</p>
<p>He said doubts about the vaccine are being “driven by those people who don't think it's safe” and reflect a view among a significant portion of the population that public health officials “have been crying wolf too many times” about the threat posed by the virus.</p>
<p>Health Canada approved a vaccine developed by pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> for protection against the flu last week, and Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq praised the shot as “safe and effective.” Provincial governments, which are currently ramping up their vaccination efforts, have said they will provide the shot free to everyone who wants it.</p>
<p>Although the Public Health Agency of Canada says the new flu has killed 86 people so far in Canada, the survey found 59 per cent of respondents believe the virus is no more worrisome than the common cold. Only 7 per cent thought it could be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Mr. Woolstencroft said opposition to the vaccination is greatest among young adults aged 18 to 34, of whom 64 per cent are opposed, while the situation is almost reversed for those over 50, with 60 per cent wanting the protection.</p>
<p>The findings suggest a lack of detailed public knowledge of the research into H1N1 influenza, which has been found to be more severe in young, relatively healthy people. Those who are older may have more immunity because they were exposed to previous outbreaks caused by a virus similar to the one now circulating.</p>
<p>Opposition to the vaccine also follows a gender divide, with 56 per cent of women saying no to the shots and only 47 per cent of men.</p>
<p>There is also a growing feeling that the media, which has been carrying a large number of stories about the new flu bug, is overplaying the threat. The media “has hyped up and exaggerated” the danger of the swine flu, according to 78 per cent of those polled, up from 68 per cent of those who agreed with the statement in July.</p>
<p>Although there are growing doubts about the vaccine, Mr. Woolstencroft said many Canadians are taking what he termed “sensible” precautions against falling ill to the H1N1 flu, with 63 per cent taking some action, up from 46 per cent who said they did in July.</p>
<p>The number of people who say they're avoiding crowded places has risen to 32 per cent from 27 per cent. There is also a growing opposition to shaking hands, a practice questioned by 35 per cent, up from 17 per cent.</p>
<p>Worries about the flu are also dampening the enthusiasm among some people for going shopping, with 19 per cent saying they're visiting stores less often, up from 14 per cent in July. Meanwhile, 19 per cent say they're more nervous about taking public transit, up from 16 per cent.</p>
<p>Strategic Counsel polled 1,000 people between Oct. 22 and Oct. 24. Because the respondents were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in an online survey, no estimates of the theoretical sampling error can be calculated, the firm said.</p>

<p>DEVELOPMENTS</p>
<p>• Canada's largest mass vaccination program is about to get under way this week across the country, although a small Quebec community jumped the gun because of a local outbreak. Trois-Pistoles, a community on the St. Lawrence River about 225 kilometres northeast of Quebec City, began vaccinations on Saturday after receiving confirmation that a group of students from the local high school had the flu</p>
<p>• In one of Canada's first sweeps of H1N1 inoculation, street nurses will be ducking in and out of alleys on Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, vaccinating the homeless, the downtrodden and the drug-addicted. Six volunteer outreach nurses are expected to start pounding the pavement and visiting local hotels for the skid-row “inoculation blitz” around the beginning of November.</p>
<p>• The president of the PEI Medical Society says the province needs an infectious diseases specialist. With the H1N1 pandemic sweeping the globe, Dr. Paul Schaefer believes PEI is at a disadvantage without a specialist. The province used to have an infectious diseases specialist but the doctor retired a few years ago and hasn't been replaced.</p>
<p>• A preteen who died after being admitted to an Ottawa hospital this weekend marks Ontario's first H1N1 fatality since the second wave of the pandemic was confirmed by health officials. Medical Officer of Health Dr. Paul Roumeliotis says he doesn't believe the preteen had any underlying health issues. The age and sex of the child and where he or she lived is not being released due to patient confidentiality.</p>
<p>• The CBC is among the first big employers to cancel the ‘Take Your Kid To Work Day' program this year because of influenza jitters. The event is normally held in November. The CBC said in a statement from its human resources department that it expects November and December will be the prime time for any outbreak of the H1N1 flu. “We've decided to cancel the 'Take Your Kid to Work' day in Toronto, for this year only, to prevent any unfortunate coincidence between H1N1 infection and the kids' presence. We think this prudent to protect the kids, ourselves in the workplace, and to avoid the problems of last minute cancellations for parents,” the statement said.</p>

A 50-year-old father and grandfather died following an explosion in a steam plant that heats 52 buildings in downtown Ottawa, including the Parliament Buildings. The man suffered severe burns to more than half his body when a boiler suddenly exploded last Monday.</p>
<p>His death raised a number of health and safety questions about that particular plant, which is tucked into a river bluff right below the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The incident also put a spotlight on another safety problem in Canada's parliament: asbestos.</p>
<p>When the boiler exploded, the debris it sent into the air was feared to include the tiny fibres which, when inhaled, cause any number of lung diseases, including rare fatal cancers. The plant's pipes were insulated with asbestos.</p>
<p>A hazardous materials team is still testing the air around the plant to see if there is a problem due to the asbestos.</p>
<p>It is yet another reminder of the dangers of asbestos, which has been mined in Canada for decades but has become an international pariah because of the dangers it poses.</p>
<p>Dozens of countries have banned its use but Canada continues to mine and export asbestos from one remaining mine in Quebec. Canada has also refused to allow asbestos to be added to an international list of toxic substances. Doing so wouldn't stop exports, but we'd have to warn importing countries that asbestos poses a serious health danger.</p>
<p>That is an important detail considering we mainly ship it to developing countries where labour codes and workplace safety regulations are sketchy at best.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper said last summer he will continue to support the mine in Quebec -- which is in a Conservative-held riding.</p>
<p>The feeling among anti-asbestos crusaders, such as Winnipeg NDP MP Pat Martin, is that consecutive Canadian governments have protected, promoted, and supported the asbestos industry solely because of Quebec politics and the fear of alienating Quebec voters in one, maybe two ridings.</p>
<p>One mine, with just a few hundred workers left, and we are risking the lives of millions in the developing world by exporting asbestos and refusing to even warn of its dangers.</p>
<p>The Harper government still argues that chrysotile asbestos, the form of the fibres mined in Quebec, is not as dangerous, and poses no risk if it is not disturbed.</p>
<p>Martin, whose political career has long focused on getting asbestos banned after he suffered lung damage from working in asbestos mines as a young adult, said that claim is ridiculous.</p>
<p>"That's like saying landmines are safe as long as you don't step on them," said Martin.</p>
<p>Martin has also long pointed out the hypocrisy of Canada spending millions to remove asbestos from the Parliament Buildings to ensure the health and safety of parliamentarians, while continuing to fund its production and export.</p>
<p>What is somewhat bizarre is the government will not release willingly the asbestos removal plan for Parliament.</p>
<p>Anti-asbestos crusader Kathleen Ruff this week was told she had to make an Access to Information request for the plan, which means the government can decide what parts of it are to be made public and spend months, if not years, to make those decisions.</p>
<p>One has to wonder if preventing this plan from going public might be because, by justifying spending millions to remove asbestos, the plan likely acknowledges asbestos does in fact pose a risk to human health, which would clearly prove the fallacy of the government's arguments to continue mining and exporting this deadly substance.</p>
<p>It is said 70 per cent of Canadians need to get the H1N1 vaccination to stop the spread of the virus. With various polls showing as many as half of Canadians don't plan to get the shot, it's unlikely that will happen.</p>
<p>It is a huge problem for Canada's public health efforts to battle H1N1.</p>
<p>Yes it is true so far that the death rates from H1N1 are not near the death rates from the regular flu. But without being alarmist, there is plenty of reason to be concerned, particularly as those who are getting the most sick are younger and healthier than those most affected by regular flu. In Ottawa Sunday, a preteen girl died from H1N1, and she had no known health problems otherwise.</p>
<p>The country's Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, was practically begging health workers to get the shot Friday.</p>
<p>The main issue seems to be a fear of the vaccine itself, uncertainty over its side effects, and concerns it was rushed to market with insufficient testing.</p>
<p>If Butler-Jones, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and Prime Minister Stephen Harper truly believe in the safety of the vaccine and truly believe it's necessary, they should line up to get the shot and ensure images of them getting it are part of a widespread public relations campaign. That would be true leadership by example.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 vaccinations start today GETTING IMMUNIZED? Clinics operating around the city - Manitobans divided on merits of immunization</b>
</div><div>By Carol Sanders   </div>

<p>The biggest mass immunization in Manitoba history gets underway this morning at 9:30 a.m. in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>With close to half of Canadians saying in a recent poll that they won't get vaccinated for the H1N1 virus, two Manitoba families who've lived through it have different opinions on H1N1 flu immunization.</p>
<p>"Take the opportunity and take these shots now," said David Chartrand, whose baby grandson Ronald had confirmed H1N1 virus earlier this year that made it difficult for him to breathe.</p>
<p>The nine-month-old has a rare medical syndrome and has spent much of his young life in hospital, said Chartrand, president of the Manitoba Métis Federation. Chartrand said he worries about hospitals being overwhelmed if people get severe H1N1 instead of the vaccine. "Enough studies prove this can prevent great harm or death," he said.</p>
<p>Scott and Michelle Myers, whose baby daughter Rhea spent weeks on a ventilator with severe H1N1 virus earlier this year, aren't sure.</p>
<p>"They're telling everyone to get it but I've heard a few different people" who have their doubts, Scott said Sunday. His aunt, a nurse, told him that vaccines usually undergo a lot more testing, he said. Doctors have told the Myers that Rhea is now immune to the H1N1 virus, and she would not need to get the vaccine, he said.</p>
<p>The toddler spent weeks in the pediatric intensive care unit this summer hooked up to a ventilator.</p>
<p>Myers said he and his wife Michelle weren't sure if they'd be getting the H1N1 vaccine but likely would not.</p>
<p>He's not alone. More than half the people who responded to a Free Press poll and an Ipsos-Reid poll, and a recent national survey, have said they will not be getting the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>A Free Press web poll found that of 2,458 votes cast, 37 per cent said they would be getting the H1N1 vaccine and 62 per cent said they would not.</p>
<p>Chartrand said he, his wife and grandkids will be getting the H1N1 vaccine this morning at the Centre Culturel Franco-Manitobain.</p>
<p>"There are strong indicators of potential harm if you don't have it," said Chartrand. He's heard about H1N1 vaccine concerns, but he's also seen the toll the first wave of the virus had on its victims and the health care system.</p>
<p>"The positive outweighs the negative. From my perspective, we have to do whatever we can to protect our families," he said.</p>
<p>Research has shown Métis people have a higher incidence of chronic health conditions than most Manitobans, and especially need to protect themselves.</p>
<p>"If we don't do something to prepare for the pandemic while we can, there could be such devastation that there will be nothing we can do about the death toll and its impact on our families," Chartrand said.</p>
<p>The MMF is waiting for approval from the province to send community liaison workers to 2,242 homes in Métis communities around the province to let people know about the pandemic and the H1N1 shot, he said. The province is also setting up vaccination clinics in Métis communities, he said. Unlike First Nations, Métis communities don't have federally funded nursing stations or health clinics, said Chartrand.</p>
<p>"We've been working hard with the province" to come up with a plan to help Métis living in communities far from doctors and hospitals get vaccinated," Chartrand said. He's hoping the details are finalized this week. A surge in severe H1N1 cases with more sick people than ventilators is a disturbing scenario that can be avoided, said Chartrand.</p>
<p>"At the end of the day, we have to protect ourselves."</p>

<p>The misinformation in Rick Salutin's column (If You're Feeling Hot, Get A Shot – Oct. 23) does Canadians a disservice by perpetuating myths about the H1N1 flu virus and dismissing the efforts of those with expertise and experience in fighting against preventable illness.</p>
<p>Undermining public confidence, particularly among pregnant women, in what is a safe and effective flu vaccine, risks the health and well-being of many and our ability to minimize the impact of this disease.</p>
<p>Provincial and territorial chief medical officers have unanimously endorsed the recommendations for the use of the H1N1 vaccine. No steps were skipped in the authorization process. We are still on target to deliver an unadjuvanted vaccine, for pregnant women who wish to stay with a traditional vaccine, in early November.</p>
<p>In cases where unadjuvanted vaccine is not available and H1N1 activity is high, medical experts recommend that women who are more than 20 weeks pregnant and those with other serious underlying risk factors be offered the adjuvanted vaccine. This is aligned with the recommendations of the World Health Organization and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.</p>
<p>Canada's response to the outbreak has been prudent, deliberate and measured. We have a pandemic plan and we have been following that plan and adapting it to the reality of the current pandemic.</p>
<p>All Canadians should be immunized as soon as possible in order to stop further spread of this very preventable disease.</p>
<p>Dr. , Chief Public Health Officer, Public Health Agency of Canada</p>

<p>Toronto -- • It isn't necessary to turn to conspiracy theories to understand public concerns surrounding the H1N1 vaccine (Health Officials Scramble To Counter H1N1 Myths – Oct. 24). The vaccine was distributed to clinics before it had been approved for use. How were medical testers supposed to deliver an impartial ruling on the safety of the vaccine when faced with the pressure of knowing it had already been distributed? In the event of uncertainty, might the benefit of the doubt not go to the more expedient alternative of approval, as opposed to a costly recall?</p>
