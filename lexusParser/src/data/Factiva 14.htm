</p>
<p>Call it the un-strike.</p>
<p>Paramedics took their labour dispute public Monday, showing up loud and angry with Health Minister Kevin Falcon outside the Terminal City Club in downtown Vancouver.</p>
<p>About 100 of the formerly on-strike workers ordered back to work Nov. 7 by Falcon made some serious noise -- and promised to continue the public protests -- while their ambulances now display their work status.</p>
<p>"They've blocked off the O, so it looks like a U," said union spokesman B.J.Chute.</p>
<p>"Un-strike.</p>
<p>"We're not picketing because we're not on strike." The paramedics were on strike for more than seven weeks -- and hounded Premier Gordon Campbell during his election tour -- but were ordered back by Falcon with the Olympics on the way and H1N1 angst in the air.</p>
<p>Chute vowed that such public demonstrations will continue, in part because the paramedics are angry that Chris Trumpy has been brought in by Campbell to probe the ambulance issue.</p>
<p>Chute said Trumpy, as a former deputy minister, is too closely aligned with the government for an objective probe.</p>
<p>"That would be like bringing in [union president] Barry O'Neill as an independent arbitrator, and asking him to do an unbiased report," said Chute.</p>
<p>"Mr. Falcon should admit he made a mistake, and bring in someone who has a history of labour negotiation." A B.C. Ambulance Service official said the company has no problem with demonstrations as long as they don't get in the way of serving the public.</p>
<p>"Paramedics have the right to protest on their own time, or their off-duty hours," said the aide. "We don't have a major concern unless it's affecting our operations.</p>
<p>"They have a right to do whatever they like in their own time." iaustin@theprovince.com</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sask. green flu outbreak claims a million victims</b>
</div><div>The StarPhoenix</div>
<div>602 words</div><div>24 November 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>Until last weekend, the news was dominated by the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>As of Sunday evening, however, a new contagion began an aggressive spread from Ground Zero in the heart of Rider Nation.</p>
<p>Two million infected lungs began to pant and pause in unison; a million throats became raw and voices went hoarse; and a million hearts pounded and froze as one.</p>
<p>Perhaps most indicative that this may be an ILI (influenza-like illness) was the unusual number of green faces -- and in some cases, entirely green bodies -- that were seen wandering the streets, exiting bars and screaming out car windows, like an attack force of hyperactive zombies.</p>
<p>Unlike H1N1, however, which was traced back to a town in Mexico, this illness definitely has its roots firmly planted in Canada.</p>
<p>In fact, it appears to have started with a group of misnamed "Slow White Canadians," who proved to be not so slow as they flew by the Grey Cup champion Calgary Stampeders in leading their team and this province to Sunday's CFL championship game.</p>
<p>And if Saskatchewan was surprised by this latest outbreak, it wasn't apparent at Mosaic Stadium, on the streets of Saskatchewan towns and cities, in the province's bars, or even in the legislature, where Premier Brad Wall beseeched his fellow citizens to continue to wear green all week in recognition of the job done by the Roughriders.</p>
<p>And while the province continues to be delirious about the win over Calgary, by all accounts the men who caused the fever seem a lot more grounded.</p>
<p>That could be because the second wave of this outbreak will undoubtedly prove to be a lot more challenging. That was made clear when, just moments before Saskatchewan began the battle that ended with Calgary's defeat, the Montreal Alouettes completely laid low the B.C. Lions.</p>
<p>The record of performance and strength of this Quebec team makes it the odds-on favourite to win the Grey Cup. As sports columnists across the land are quick to point out, the Alouettes are one of the most powerful CFL franchises ever. And if there is a province that comes close to fostering a football culture as strong as Saskatchewan, it is Quebec.</p>
<p>But, as Damien Cox with the Toronto Star points out, Saskatchewan boasts a national depth no other franchise can match.</p>
<p>"While the other seven clubs search high and low for speedy, sure-handed Americans to catch the football in what is primarily a passing league, the Green Riders prefer to use homebrews," Cox wrote Monday.</p>
<p>And while observers note that the Alouettes are beginning to realize and boast about just how good they are, the Saskatchewan squad has -- as Premier Wall pointed out -- a quiet confidence that doesn't allow them to get down even when they are down.</p>
<p>It is a confidence that springs from the heart of a province that is only too familiar with what it's like to be the underdog.</p>
<p>So while the latest ILI sweeping Saskatchewan may be unusually virulent and may even have a temporary impact on productivity in the province, it is a refreshing change from years of anticipation.</p>
<p>And if, as the team declares, its fans declare and even the premier suggests, there's a basis for confidence in Sunday's outcome, we shouldn't be surprised if even the most dedicated employees across the province call in on Monday, Nov. 25, to report they're suffering from an ILI whose symptoms include hoarse voices, sleeplessness and excited delirium.</p>

</div><div>The StarPhoenix</div>

</p>
<p>The Prairieland Park mass immunization site will be closed today so the clinic can move from one hall to another.</p>
<p>The clinic will move today from Hall E to Hall D at Prairieland Park, reopening at 1 p.m. Wednesday in time to offer H1N1 immunizations to the general public.</p>
<p>The H1N1 shot will still be available today for people in high-risk groups at the Saskatoon Health Region's rural clinics, in designated schools and other smaller sites that were previously announced. At-risk people include anyone six months or older with a chronic medical condition or caregivers of immune-compromised people.</p>
<p>Starting Wednesday, the vaccine will be made available to anyone who wants it. The Prairieland site will be open from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends until at least mid-December.</p>
<p>Starting in early December, the health region will offer second H1N1 shots to children aged six months to three years, and children aged three to nine who have chronic health conditions. The region says healthy children aged three to nine do not require a second shot of the vaccine.</p>
<p>The seasonal flu shot will also be available starting Wednesday for people traditionally at high risk. They include adults 65 and older, long-term care home or personal care home residents, pregnant women, infants and toddlers six-to-23-months-old, and people with chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>For more clinic locations and times, see the health region's website at www.saskatoonhealthregion.ca[http://www.saskatoonhealthregion.ca].</p>

<p>BERLUSCONI FIGHTS FOR HIS ALLIES</p>
<p>ROME -- Silvio Berlusconi was struggling to contain open warfare within his coalition government Monday after differences between his two most important allies degenerated into a slanging match.</p>
<p>Tension has been rising for months between the prime minister's allies Gianfranco</p>
<p>Fini, the leader of a conservative faction, and Umberto Bossi, the head of the Northern League, over immigrants' voting and citizenship rights.</p>
<p>It spilt over when Fini, the speaker of the lower house of parliament, said that "anyone who discriminates against foreigners is a piece of --."</p>
<p>The remark was made in a speech on the outskirts of Rome to teenagers from countries including Eritrea, China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It incensed the Northern League, which is largely hostile to the nearly four million foreigners who live in Italy, both legally and illegally.</p>
<p>FORMER DUCHESS'S AIDE ON THE RUN</p>
<p>A convicted murderer and former aide to the Duchess of York is on the run after she absconded from an open prison.</p>
<p>Staff at HMP East Sutton Park in Maidstone, Kent, discovered that Jane Andrews, 42, was missing at an 8 p.m. roll call Sunday.</p>
<p>Police are searching the area for Andrews, who was convicted in 2001 of murdering her boyfriend Thomas Cressman, 39, by stabbing him and battering him with a cricket bat after he refused to marry her.</p>
<p>Andrews, who worked as the Duchess's dresser for nine years until she was sacked in 1997, was moved to the women's prison last week. She had to be transferred to hospital after she took an overdose of painkillers within hours of arriving at East Sutton Park.</p>
<p>BRITISH POLICE TO PAY COMPENSATION</p>
<p>LONDON -- British police said Monday they have agreed a compensation deal with the family of an innocent Brazilian who was shot dead in London four years ago after being mistaken for a suicide bomber.</p>
<p>The family of Jean Charles de Menezes "are pleased that a compensation package has been agreed which enables them to put these events behind them and move forward with their lives," Scotland Yard declared in what it said was a joint statement with De Menezes's relatives.</p>
<p>It did not say how much the deal is worth, and said that no further comments would be made on the agreement.</p>
<p>FIRING HIV POLICE UNCONSTITUTIONAL</p>
<p>WARSAW -- A Polish court on Monday ruled that a directive from the interior ministry ordering the automatic firing of police officers who test HIV positive was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>"While the presence of the AIDS virus can, in effect, be considered undesirable in the case of rescue patrols, there are a number of posts in which it is not important, such as in the police administration, teaching, as well as analytical and other departments," a constitutional court statement said.</p>
<p>Introduced in 1991, the directive in question specified that all people diagnosed with the virus were "declared entirely incapable of working" in the police force.</p>
<p>SOUTH AMERICA</p>
<p>U.S., ISRAEL 'DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE'</p>
<p>BRASILIA -- Visiting Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad said Monday that U.S. and Israeli military threats against Iran were a thing of the past, and that, in any case, "they don't have the courage" to attack Iran.</p>
<p>"The age of military attacks is over, now we've reached the time for dialogue and understanding. Weapons and threats are a thing of the past," the Iranian told a joint press conference with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, closing his one-day visit.</p>
<p>Ahmadinejad's visit was greeted Sunday in Rio de Janeiro by a 1,000-strong rally of members of Jewish, anti-racist and gay rights groups who protested his past tirades against Israel and other groups.</p>
<p>Fielding a question on whether he feared an attack from Israel or the United States, Ahmadinejad said armed confrontation was no longer a possibility.</p>
<p>That's clear "even for mentally challenged people," he said with a smile.</p>
<p>Besides, he added, "those you mention (Israel and United States) don't have the courage to attack Iran. They're not even thinking about it."</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICA</p>
<p>SANTAS WANT PRIORITY FLU SHOTS</p>
<p>NEW YORK -- Santas in America have demanded priority status for swine flu vaccinations as part of an arsenal of precautions they are taking before welcoming the seasonal tide of runny-nosed children.</p>
<p>Doctors have warned that the traditional visit to Santa could become one of the prime means of spreading the virus throughout America. Health organizations raised concerns that the men in red suits would be among the most likely victims of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Professional Santa organizations have urged members to install hand sanitizers and subject suits and beards to extra cleaning. Shops have given elves the task of weeding out sickly looking children.</p>
<p>DUI DROPPED FOR KERRY'S DAUGHTER</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES -- Prosecutors have declined to file charges against U.S. Senator John Kerry's elder daughter, Alexandra, who was arrested in Hollywood last week on suspicion of drunken driving.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office said Monday the case was dropped "due to insufficiency of the evidence we were presented."</p>
<p>The 36-year-old aspiring filmmaker was stopped by police last Thursday and jailed briefly on a misdemeanoir charge of driving under the influence.</p>
<p>BERMUDA MARKING 400TH ANNIVERSARY</p>
<p>HAMILTON, Bermuda -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II began a three-day visit to Bermuda Monday to take part in celebrations to mark the 400th anniversary of the first English settlers here.</p>
<p>Accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, the queen was met by Bermuda Governor Richard Gozney ahead of Wednesday's celebrations here.</p>
<p>The royal couple will then head to Trinidad and Tobago to attend the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting which brings together the body's 53 member nations, most of which are former British colonies.</p>
<p>With a population of about 70,000 people, the Bermudas are Britain's oldest overseas territory.</p>
<p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
<p>IRAQI TV PRESENTER WOUNDED</p>
<p>BAGHDAD -- An Iraqi television presenter was wounded on Monday when unknown attackers shot him while he was driving to work in central Baghdad, police and the channel he worked for said.</p>
<p>Imad Abadi, 36, received shots to the head and neck while he was driving along Saadun Street in the centre of the capital.</p>
<p>He was in stable condition in the hospital, said Faisal Yasiri, the owner of the independent Al-Diyar channel.</p>
<p>"It was not a random shooting, he was targeted," Yasiri told AFP.</p>
<p>"He has a program in which he raises delicate issues, and he often defends journalists, and maybe he angered some people."</p>
<p>ASIA</p>
<p>MIDDLE CLASS PROTESTS IN CHINA</p>
<p>SHANGHAI -- China's burgeoning middle class lodged its first mass challenge against the government Monday by staging an environmental protest.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 people initially took to the streets in the southern city of Guangzhou to protest against the building of a garbage incinerator near their homes. But the crowd expanded as protesters sent reports through Twitter and posted photographs on the Internet.</p>
<p>Twitter is blocked by the government in China but has a growing following among those who can get access through servers abroad.</p>
<p>"The matter didn't directly concern us, but we were pursuing the public interest and we wanted to show our friends and other people what was going on so we used all the modern technology we could to show a protest in real time," said one demonstrator.</p>
<p>FORMER THAI PM SAMAK DIES AT 74</p>
<p>BANGKOK -- Former Thai prime minister Samak Sundaravej, who was forced from office in 2008 for appearing in television cooking shows, died of liver cancer today at the age of 74, associates said.</p>
<p>Samak led the People Power Party to victory in elections in December 2007, the first since a military coup that ousted his ally, former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, just over one year earlier.</p>
<p>"He died just before 9 a.m. in hospital. We still don't know his funeral plans," one close political associate said. An official at private <span class="companylink">Bumrungrad Hospital</span> in Bangkok also confirmed his death.</p>
<p>Samak had been battling liver cancer for more than a year.</p>
<p>His time as prime minister was abruptly cut short in September 2008 when Thailand's top court ruled that he had breached rules by accepting payment for two television shows, in which he cooked and critiqued food.</p>
<p>TAIWAN MAN ROBBED OF $2M</p>
<p>TAIPEI -- A man in Taiwan was robbed of more than $2 million in cash that he had just withdrawn from the bank, a police official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Three masked gunmen robbed the 50-year-old victim on Monday afternoon in the southern city of Tainan, logging the highest-value robbery in city history with a heist of T$77 million (US$2.39 million), said a police investigation official surnamed Chang.</p>
<p>The gunmen approached the victim, surnamed Tsai, as he drove from the bank to his watch shop nearby, Taiwan's Central News Agency said. One shot a shop employee in the foot during a scuffle to fight off the gunmen, the agency said.</p>
<p>Police are looking for the three men while advising people in the 769,000-population city to be more vigilant.</p>
<p>"We're putting out a notice on public safety, telling citizens that we're ready stand beside them for protection as they use the bank," Chang said.</p>
<p>AFRICA</p>
<p>SUSPECT INDICTED IN MAURITANIAN ATTACK</p>
<p>NOUAKCHOTT -- A suspected member of al-Qaida's north African branch has been indicted over his alleged role in a bloody 2008 attack which left 11 Mauritanian soldiers dead, a legal source said Monday.</p>
<p>"The investigating magistrate has heard the defendant and indicted him over the terrorist attack against his country and ordered his detention in Nouakchott's civil prison," the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP.</p>
<p>Twenty-three-year-old Mohamed Ould Ahmed -- also known as Khaled or Abou Mouslim -- is accused of taking part in the attack on an army patrol in the far north of Mauritania near the town of Tourine in September 2008.</p>
<p>The bodies of 11 soldiers and their guide were found beheaded and booby trapped after the attack.</p>

<p>Re: Time to address wages, by David Musyj, Nov. 14.</p>
<p>As president of the Ontario Nurses' Association, I was startled and disappointed, as were the dedicated nurses of ONA Local 011 at Windsor Regional Hospital, as we read the misleading column written by Windsor Regional Hospital president and CEO David Musyj.</p>
<p>This CEO has joined the ranks of those who are attempting to convince Ontario taxpayers that the province's hard-working registered nurses and other front-line caregivers must somehow be made to pay for the underfunding of our hospitals. Mr. Musyj fails to inform readers that he readily signed the negotiated, not arbitrated, contract of the RNs at Windsor Regional, and yet, calls for an immediate freeze of wages and benefits for health care workers.</p>
<p>Despite statements in the media recently that public-sector workers have been "sheltered" from the economic downturn, registered nurses were in fact among the first to see their jobs cut. RNs in this province have experienced years of job cuts, workloads that have become so unreasonable that many fear for their patients' safety, and have seen hospital CEOs turn to the front lines first when it's time to balance the bottom line.</p>
<p>The result of eliminating 1,265 RN positions in this province over the last six months will be increasing death and disease rates for our patients. The many years of evidence-based research regarding our patients' health outcomes tells us this loud and clear. This has also led to a severe decline in the morale of the nurses who work so hard to care for those in their communities.</p>
<p>Mr. Musyj's editorial targets those who do the most to provide patient care while failing to mention the increasingly large sums of taxpayer dollars going out the door to consultants.</p>
<p>Nurses are the backbone of this system. Our backs are weary as a result of the current nursing shortages, H1N1 and the excessive overtime we are working to hold the system together. Now is the time to support the nurses and the vital services we provide. We are taxpayers too, and we know where funding does the most good.</p>
<p>So do Ontarians.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 vaccine program on the mend</b>
</div><div>Dr. Yoel Abells   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>567 words</div><div>24 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>AL5</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine fiasco of the past few weeks has left me dumbstruck -- and maybe somewhat embarrassed. Let me explain.</p>
<p>On July 22, I wrote a column entitled "Planning for H1N1 trumps worry and fear." My intent was to try to allay some of the anxieties being promulgated by the media by offering insight into the extensive planning that had been going on since SARS in order to effectively respond to a pandemic.</p>
<p>I spoke from a position of knowledge (or so I thought). As I stated in that article, I was chair of Family Physicians Toronto (the group that demanded and formulated a response to community-based needs during SARS), co-presented a major paper to the SARS Commission on lessons learned from this experience and spent a number of hours over the past year serving as a member of the Pandemic Planning Committee developing guidelines for any future response to a pandemic.</p>
<p>Key amongst the recommendations was the need for strong leadership, an investment in health human resources, an integration of primary care and public health and a proper communication system offering clear and concise messages to health-care providers. Unfortunately, it seems as though much of what was proposed was ignored. Here are only three examples:</p>
<p>At first, family physicians (FPs) were led to believe that they were not to be part of the immunization process. In fact, by virtue of the paperwork demands that Public Health expected of those physicians wanting to offer the vaccines in their office, it appeared as though we were being strongly discouraged from doing so. Yet, when the clinics were unable to meet the demand, many in the public questioned the dedication of FPs because of their lack of involvement.</p>
<p>Then there were the unbelievably inane decisions regarding the vaccination clinics. For example, whose idea was it to limit the hours of operation to the times that were the least convenient for the public?</p>
<p>The issue of leadership and the importance of concise, uniform information was a major concern raised by us at the SARS Commission. Yet the same problems of leadership and communication have been happening during the past few weeks. I have been overwhelmed by the number of patients who have chosen to listen to celebrities such as the comedian Bill Maher who have abused their pedestals to make unproven statements about health-care issues and who have spoken loudly against the H1N1 vaccine. But I understand the reason for these patients' reaction. The fact is that Maher's message is unclouded by shades of grey, in counter distinction to the often conflicting communications emanating from the mouths of varying officials supposedly in the know.</p>
<p>If there has been one bright light in this whole debacle, it has been the Ontario Medical Association, lead by its president, Dr. Suzanne Strasberg. The OMA has sent out timely information about the vaccine and has been enormously responsive to the concerns of physicians in the community as they cope with the mess.</p>
<p>So where do matters stand at present? It appears as though -- finally -- the call for defined leadership and precise messaging is being heard, the recommended integration of public health and FPs is about to happen and the appropriate investment in human resources is being considered. It is about time.</p>

<div>Issues & Ideas</div>
<div id="hd"><b>A prescription for quackery; Many 'naturopaths' reject basic scientific principles of medicine. So why in the world does the Ontario government want to give them the legal right to prescribe real drugs?</b>
</div><div>Scott Gavura   </div>
<div>Special to the National Post</div>
<div>1554 words</div><div>24 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>The other day, I went to a magic show. The magician manipulated energy fields, pulled toxins out of my stomach, and then gave me a "remedy" ... but there was nothing inside. Then he pulled out a prescription pad, prescribed some Tamiflu, and sent me on my way.</p>
<p>Seem unlikely? Well, the Ontario government is poised to give another type of magician -- the naturopath -- prescribing rights, despite the reams of evidence discrediting their approach to patient health. It's a move that legitimizes a well-meaning but baseless profession, and puts patients at significant risk.</p>
<p>Surely, I much be exaggerating, right? After all, naturopaths practice "natural healing," and nature is good, isn't it?</p>
<p>Unfortunately for patients, no evidence exists to suggest that naturopaths are capable primary care providers. Naturopathy is a fundamentally flawed idea--and a government blessing only entrenches and magnifies the health risks to Canadians.</p>
<p>Naturopathy's key premise is bogus. Its underlying premise is called "vitalism": the idea that humans are possessed with a magical quality that transcends the laws of physics. Sometimes called vis medicatrix naturae (the healing power of nature), vitalism is essentially magical thinking: the belief that some type of "energy field" or "life force" can be harnessed and manipulated by the naturopath. Vitalism was rejected by the medical profession decades ago, about the time it was discovered that bloodletting to balance the body's "humors" was a bad idea. Substantial developments in medical science over the past hundred years have put the idea of vitalism in the dust-bin of medical ideas. Naturopathic principles are, at their core, based around this profoundly unscientific and incorrect idea of health.</p>
<p>With vitalism at its core, naturopaths accept and use just about every implausible or scientifically discarded therapy that exists. Without any minimum standard upon which to evaluate (and reject) treatments, anything can be "naturopathic." Homeopathy, for instance, is an elaborate placebo system without any persuasive evidence of efficacy, yet naturopaths have it as a central component of their curriculum. Based on the implausible premise of "like cures like" and "dilution makes it stronger," advocates believe that the light reflecting off Saturn, raccoon fur or even ultra-dilute table salt can be a homeopathic remedy. Other popular naturopathic treatments include reiki (magical energy healing), even hydrotherapy (flushing the colon with water). Given the questionable curriculum, it is unclear how naturopathy can be credibly compared to any science-based health profession.</p>
<p>Here, for instance, is a description of Asian Medicine I, from the Toronto-based Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine's curriculum:</p>
<p>"Students focus on the fundamentals of Traditional Chinese Medicine including basic history, philosophy, and development. They are introduced to fundamental theories including Yin/Yang, five elements and Zang-Fu. Therapeutic and diagnostic theories introduced include 8 principles, 6 Pathogenic Factors, Qi, Blood, Body Fluids and 7 emotions. There is discussion on acupuncture channels, pulse and tongue diagnosis as well as other therapies applicable for use in Traditional Chinese Medicine."</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Canada's only naturopathy school is not affiliated with any university, medical school or publicly-funded hospital. Unlike health professionals, naturopaths do not do undergraduate and postgraduate training in teaching hospitals.</p>
<p>A combination of a flawed premise and a credulous approach to evidence leads naturopaths to advocate all types of bizarre treatments for real medical conditions: cleansing diets for eczema, ginseng to treat cancer and even homeopathy for diabetes. Naturopaths antagonize established public health goals with their frequent opposition to vaccinations. Recent articles by naturopaths, advocating probiotics, herbal extracts or even homeopathy, instead of the H1N1 vaccine, underscore this concern. Vitamin supplementation for virtually every medical condition is common. If a treatment has been rejected as unscientific, or proven to be ineffective, there seems to be a naturopath who recommends it.</p>
<p>If naturopaths want to prescribe placebo treatments such as homeopathy, and wave their arms over someone to manipulate their invisible energy fields, the biggest risk to consumers is likely limited to their wallets. But when patients avoid legitimate, evidence-based care from health professionals, or receive prescriptions based on pseudoscientific ideas about a disease, there is a real risk of harm.</p>
<p>Prescription drugs have real effects and real side effects. There's no evidence that naturopaths have an evidence base equivalent to health professionals such as physicians and pharmacists. A review of the initial list of drugs that Ontario naturopaths want to prescribe is telling. Bioidentical hormones are on the list, with their celebrity advocates such Oprah and Suzanne Somers, but unequivocal criticism from medical experts. Also listed are animal "glandular extracts" (dried thymus, spleen, and liver, anyone?), which are used to treat "adrenal fatigue," a condition that seems to exist only in patients that see naturopaths. And there are antibiotics, antifungals and antivirals -- despite any evidence that naturopaths can accurately diagnose and treat conditions that require these therapies.</p>
<p>Other jurisdictions have experimented with giving naturopaths prescribing rights. (Ontario is now poised to become the second province to extend prescribing privileges to naturopaths -- the other is British Columbia.) Despite the claims made about the safety of naturopathy, deaths and serious injuries have been documented as a consequence of prescribing privileges. Canadian heath professionals have raised pointed and specific concerns about naturopathy. A coalition of seven Canadian allergy organizations wrote to the B.C. Minister of Health, George Abbott, protesting that province's plan to allow naturopaths to perform allergy testing and treatment. They point out that naturopaths do not define allergies in evidence-based ways, nor do they use scientifically-validated methods of testing allergies. They also emphasize that naturopaths do not support immunizations.</p>
<p>Naturopath prescribing is also raising questions about the liability of other health professionals who interact with their clients -- including pharmacists, such as myself.</p>
<p>A key role of the pharmacist is to double-check the safety and appropriateness of a prescribed drug. When required, the pharmacist resolves drug-related problems with the prescriber. This is only possible because pharmacists, physicians, and nurse practitioners work from a common, science-based understanding of drugs and disease. In contrast, naturopaths may not share this science-based approach to illness, and may rely on references that are unknown to, inconsistent with, or directly contradict the medically accepted standard of care. If naturopaths prescribe a drug based on a naturopathic belief system, and a pharmacist determines that the prescription is not appropriate from a scientific and evidence-based perspective, what will the pharmacist's responsibility be? Will pharmacists be held liable for prescriptions written by naturopaths who do not share a sciencebased view of illness?</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Earlier this year, when the Health Professions Regulatory Advisory Council (HPRAC) recommended that the Ontario government legislate a significant expansion of practice for naturopaths, health professionals were understandably concerned, and pressed for changes. In what appeared to be a decision in favour of evidence-based health care, the initial version of Ontario's Bill 179 -- the Regulated Health Professions Statute Law Amendment Act -- expressly omitted any expansion of scope for naturopathy.</p>
<p>It was clear the naturopaths were not going to let this pass without challenge, with British Columbia recently giving naturopaths prescribing rights. In June, Ontario naturopaths launched a write-in campaign to government that described naturopaths as primary care providers, comparable to family physicians, and worthy of the right to prescribe.</p>
<p>The bill passed second reading and was referred to the Standing Committee on Social Policy. Several naturopath organizations were on the agenda, and argued for "unambiguous authority for prescribing, compounding, dispensing or selling a drug as designated in the regulations" -- essentially a clause that will allow naturopaths gain access to prescription drugs, developing a list out of the public eye. The standing committee accepted this request, and put naturopath prescribing into Bill 179. Third reading is expected in the near future. If it passes, the right for naturopaths to prescribe drugs will become entrenched in Ontario law.</p>
<p>This year, the Ontario Government projects it will run $24.7-billion budget deficit. Significant changes are expected throughout the health system. That's fine. But why is the government proceeding with changes that will reduce quality, increase risk, and waste health resources? Naturopath prescribing lacks a sound evidence base, addresses no clear medical need and has the potential to increase patient harm and health care costs.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Save antivirals for worst cases: WHO; 'It's a bit of catch-22'. Most flu sufferers don't need drugs - but those who do need them fast</b>
</div><div>SHARON KIRKEY   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>984 words</div><div>23 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>As public health officials urge more rapid use of antivirals for H1N1, some experts worry the drugs could become over-prescribed for what is a relatively mild illness in most people.</p>
<p>More than one million antiviral doses have been drawn from the federal stockpile in recent months, and the number of prescriptions filled by Canadian retail drugstores for Tamiflu and Relenza, the frontline drugs being used in the pandemic, nearly doubled between September and October.</p>
<p>As of Oct. 30, 151,688 prescriptions had been dispensed by retail pharmacists nationwide so far this year -- an increase of 73,291 prescriptions over September, according to prescription-drug-tracking firm <span class="companylink">IMS Health Canada</span>.</p>
<p>Nationally, the number of visits to doctors for flu-like symptoms are at levels not seen in 12 years.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people in at-risk groups, including pregnant women, children under 2 and those with underlying conditions such as asthma, be treated with antivirals as soon as possible when they have flu symptoms, and that people without risk factors should also be treated if their symptoms worsen or persist.</p>
<p>WHO says otherwise healthy people experiencing only mild illness don't need antivirals. But the world agency warns the virus can cause severe pneumonia even in healthy young people.</p>
<p>"The window of opportunity is very narrow to reverse the progression of the disease," Nikki Shindo, a medical officer in WHO's Global Influenza Program, said in a briefing. "The medicine needs to be administered before the virus destroys the lungs."</p>
<p>WHO is urging doctors not to wait for lab confirmation before deciding to treat. Tamiflu, or oseltamivir, needs to be given within 48 hours of infection to be optimally effective.</p>
<p>"It's a bit of Catch-22, when the best impact of the oseltamivir is if you give it early. And yet we're not suggesting that the huge majority of people get oseltamivir," said Brian Ward, an infectious-disease physician and associate director of The Research Institute at McGill University Health Centre.</p>
<p>"Most of the people who have true influenza should not be prescribed oseltamivir," Ward said.</p>
<p>The drugs can cause nausea and vomiting, and widespread use could lead to H1N1 developing resistance to the only effective antivirals available.</p>
<p>"Really, the cutoff is clinical symptoms out of proportion for what you would expect for routine influenza," Ward said.</p>
<p>He had H1N1 in the summer, "and I very specifically did not take oseltamivir. I didn't want to spread a resistant bug to my children and family. And I had flu. I didn't have unexpected symptoms.</p>
<p>"We should be reserving the oseltamivir for people who are presenting with unusual symptoms."</p>
<p>For most people, that would be unexpectedly or surprisingly severe respiratory distress, he said.</p>
<p>"In a very young child, it would be rapid onset of very high fever with respiratory distress ... or an older child who does okay for a day or two - so muscle aches, headaches, a little bit of cough - who suddenly starts having difficulty breathing."</p>
<p>In addition, for children with asthma, the threshold for starting Tamiflu "is way, way lower" than it would be for an otherwise healthy child, Ward said.</p>
<p>According to Health Canada, Tamiflu has been shown to reduce the symptoms of illness by, on average, 1.3 days, or 30 hours. An average course of flu lasts approximately five to seven days.</p>
<p>"For the normal flu, they generally cut between a half a day and a day off of the length of symptoms," says Dr. Joel Lexchin, a professor in York University's School of Health Policy and Management.</p>
<p>"If we prescribe them for people with relatively mild flu, and the virus develops resistance, then they wouldn't be of very much use for people with severe cases of H1N1."</p>
<p>A 2008 study by University of Florida researchers who used health insurance claims data from five flu seasons found that adults given Tamiflu for seasonal flu were 30 per cent less likely to be hospitalized than those not given antiviral therapy.</p>
<p>In children and teens, the risk of a diagnosis of pneumonia was 36 per cent lower in 6- to 12-year-olds prescribed Tamiflu, compared to children not given the drugs. The study was paid for by Roche, the makers of Tamiflu.</p>
<p>Between April 1 and Oct. 23, the government received 19 reports of suspected adverse reactions for Tamiflu, of which 11 were classified as serious. The reports are based on suspicions only, and do not prove the drug caused the reaction. Serious reactions reported included increased blood pressure and dizziness. Delirium was reported in a 16-year-old.</p>
<p>As of Nov. 19, 250 deaths due to H1N1 had been reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada since the outbreak began in April.</p>

</p>
<p>This weekend marks five years since the start of the Orange Revolution that saw protesters mass in the streets of Kyiv to protest a flawed vote in the second round of the presidential elections that favoured incumbent prime minister Viktor Yanukovych. After a series of events and the intrusion of the Constitutional Court, that round was rerun and challenger Viktor Yushchenko was elected president of Ukraine. He formed a coalition of Orange forces that included his Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko and Speaker of Parliament, Oleksandr Moroz.</p>
<p>Five years on and into another election campaign, the Orange camp is in a sorry mess. Moroz has left the Orange camp. Although Tymoshenko is in her second term as prime minister, she faces a large opposition in parliament and feuds constantly with the president. She is running against Yushchenko for the presidency in January 2010.Yanukovych, leader of the Regions Party, is back once again, intent on sabotaging the Tymoshenko campaign as well as opposing fiscal measures to deal with the recession.</p>
<p>Very little makes sense in Ukrainian politics, which are so intricate, corrupt and mutable that few can unravel events to make a pertinent analysis.</p>
<p>Recently, for example, the International Monetary Fund, which last year provided a loan of $16.4 billion to help Ukraine, withheld a tranche of $3.8 billion. The reason was that the president and the parliamentary opposition (Yanukovych) backed a rise in minimum wages of 20 per cent next year, thus contravening IMF conditions for continuing the loans. Perhaps they acted from humanitarian motives, but more likely they simply wished to undermine the position of the prime minister.</p>
<p>The president has also vetoed a law that would have provided about $125 million to combat H1N1 in Ukraine, which recently reached epidemic proportions with 189 deaths. There is little logic to his agreeing to wage increases but ignoring the flu virus.</p>
<p>One of the ironies of the president's approval of the pay rises is that Yushchenko is known as a fiscal conservative, who lambasted Tymoshenko's 2009 budget for its free-spending profligacy. Rumours in Kyiv now suggest that the president's office would like to secure the release of former prime minister Pavlo Lazarenko, currently under arrest in the United States for money laundering. The reason is that his return to Ukraine would undermine the position of his former deputy prime minister, Tymoshenko, then known as the "gas princess" in an era of runaway corruption.</p>
<p>Tymoshenko, for her part, has campaigned hard to improve her position. Without doubt she has spent the most money -- according to Yushchenko, she has exploited the office of Prime Minister to finance her campaign. Last week she met with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in Yalta and secured an agreement on gas prices in 2010, which would mean that Ukraine would not be penalized for purchasing less gas than agreed. This was a major coup, given the interruptions to gas supplies to Europe last year as a result of a Russian-Ukrainian impasse. It also signals to voters that under a Tymoshenko presidency, relations with Russia would improve dramatically.</p>
<p>At the same time, Yushchenko hosted Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili in Kyiv. According to the Ukrainian media, Tymoshenko and Putin enjoyed a few jokes at the expense of the two chief leaders of the colour revolutions of the early 21st century. Russia has accused Ukraine's president of supporting the Georgians in the August 2008 conflict.</p>
<p>Polls suggest that Tymoshenko is catching up with Yanukovych as the election's front-runner. A poll conducted by Ukrainian Project System on Nov. 12, indicated that Yanukovych has the backing of 21.4 per cent of voters to her 18.1 per cent. Arseny Yatseniuk, in third place, has only eight per cent and is no longer a serious contender.</p>
<p>The most recent poll of the Razumkov Centre on a potential run-off between Tymoshenko and Yanukovych suggests it would be a very close call. Tymoshenko would win easily in Western Ukraine, by a lesser margin in the centre, and Yanukovych is well ahead in the south and east.</p>
<p>The choice for voters seems rather stark. Yanukovych is still the arch apparatchik, fumbling and inarticulate, and bankrolled by Ukraine's main oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. The Western media describe him as pro-Russian, but he is essentially a tool of eastern oligarchs, people who wish to maintain their influence and power over resources and industry. There is no question that the prime minister poses a threat to such forces.</p>
<p>Tymoshenko, on the other hand, is a ruthless politician with few clearly delineated principles other than her own advancement and power. In her first period as prime minister in 2005--it lasted only nine months --she alienated most of her cabinet. In the second, she has struggled to deal with the economic crisis. IMF funds have cushioned the blow, but the Ukrainian economy shrank by almost 16 per cent in the third quarter of 2009. The steel industry will take years to recover from a dramatic drop in trade abroad.</p>
<p>The next president will not only need to introduce radical economic measures, he/she will need to work with parliament. To date, the failure to form a workable coalition in the legislature, added to unseemly squabbles between the main leaders, has resulted in deadlock. In 2004, Yushchenko was the outsider, a potential candidate to end the rampant corruption in Ukraine and make a new beginning. In 2010 voters face a bleaker choice and the alternatives seems less clear-cut.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Millennium's first decade turned out to be a drag; Even the big stories look small in historical terms</b>
</div><div>Bruce Ward   </div>
<div>Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>817 words</div><div>23 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Somewhere, I've got a plastic champagne glass left over from the millennium celebrations and a ticket stub for Celine Dion's New Year's Eve 1999 show in Montreal.</p>
<p>Didn't make the concert, and I drank only coffee on the big night. My colleagues and I were stuck in the newsroom, waiting for the Y2K bug to wreak financial havoc. It didn't happen. We had to wait nine years for <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> to accomplish that.</p>
<p>So, for me, the new century started with a looming deadline and a big letdown. In literature, this is called foreshadowing--a warning or indication of some future event. And, sure enough, the entire decade turned out to be a drag.</p>
<p>Now the end of "the Naughties"-- did anyone ever call it that?--is in sight. I know time speeds up when you get older, but, boy, that didn't take long.</p>
<p>Looking back, it's pretty clear that the past 10 years should have been called the Dumb Decade. Pop culture got crass and ugly. There was nothing on network TV but idiotic reality shows, nothing worth listening to on the radio, and movies got steadily worse.</p>
<p>Politically, the Is-this-a-great-decade-or-what?moment arrived in November 2000. The Progressive Conservative Party was crushed in the federal election, winning 12 seats. I thought this would bring something interesting to the political landscape. But the Tories didn't stay in oblivion. The party gave itself a makeover, dropped a few pounds and went blond. It took on a new name--the Swinging Blue Jeans --and instantly became more attractive to Quebec voters.</p>
<p>The decade's scariest rise to power? No question, it was the ascension of Simon Cowell, the judge on American Idol.</p>
<p>So far the biggest stories of the 21st century have been terrorism, technology and the stock-market meltdown.</p>
<p>Each, in its own way, has not been that big a deal in historical terms. The tide of terrorist atrocities predicted in the wake of Sept. 11,2001, never materialized in the West. There have been no further attacks on American soil since 9/11, assuming the recent rampage at Fort Hood was an act of madness, and not the work of a "sleeper" Islamic terrorist/ psychiatrist.</p>
<p>The bombings in London and Madrid turned out to be isolated horrors. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been bloody enough, but nothing on the scale of the Second World War slaughters.</p>
<p>The economic downtown of the past two years seems minor compared with the global Depression of the 1930s. I was in London in late October, and Christmas decorations were already in place on Oxford Street. The sidewalks were heaving with shoppers, and the big department stores were so crowded that I had to give up and find a quiet pub. It didn't feel like a city battling a recession.</p>
<p>The decade saw a digital revolution of sorts, but it really wasn't all that breathtaking. Apple came up with some nifty gadgets, but mostly technology brought new ways to do things we already do. Watching TV on the Internet? It's OK, but nothing as exciting or life-changing as the day your family finally got its first television set.</p>
<p>For me, the decade's most compelling news story was the tsunami that struck on Boxing Day 2004. It ranks as one of the deadliest natural disasters in history, having killed an estimated 200,000 people. It was a reminder that humans are still vulnerable to the terrifying vagaries of the weather.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, the 20th century began with a disaster. On April 26, 1900, a house fire in Hull became an inferno when strong winds brought flaming embers across the river to Ottawa's lumberyards. Headlines in the next day's Citizen read Large Portion of Ottawa Destroyed and Hull to All Intents Wiped Out.</p>
<p>Though more than 14,000 lost their homes, only seven people died in the fire. More people died of disease in the unsanitary tent cities where the homeless were forced to live afterward.</p>
<p>If the past 10 years teaches us anything, it's how fortunate we are. We endured SARS and bird flu, and, although H1N1 is still in our midst, it seems to be peaking. We'll get through it, too.</p>
<p>The big news story of the new decade seems certain to be the waning of U.S. dominance and the emergence of China and India as the new superpowers, but that already seems so 1998.</p>
<p>Our times are more likely to be defined by how we finally woke up and began to preserve the environment. Or by our deadly failure to do so.</p>

</p>
<p>As the province reopens its H1N1 vaccination campaign to all Albertans who want to get the shot, a seventh clinic is opening in Calgary today to help ease some of the long lineups. The new clinic is in the South Calgary Health Centre at 31 Sunpark Plaza S.E.</p>
<p>"Certainly what we're trying to do is make it as convenient as possible," said Alberta Health Services spokesman Bruce Conway.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, health officials have been staggering delivery of the vaccine, focusing on providing the H1N1 shot to those more at risk of developing the new flu strain.</p>
<p>The province expects to receive enough vaccine to immunize 50,000 people a day over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Other strategies are in place if lineups get too onerous, including giving people wristbands so they can leave and come back for their shot at a particular time.</p>
<p>The clinics are scheduled to run until late December.</p>

</div><div>Denise Ryan   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>242 words</div><div>23 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>A Vancouver Coastal Health review has found that Richmond General Hospital was not at fault in the death of a Richmond woman who died of the H1N1 virus after twice being sent home from hospital.</p>
<p>Mae Mah, 51, died on Nov. 1, hours after being sent home from the Richmond hospital. She had also been to the hospital the day before.</p>
<p>Mah had asthma, and had been experiencing breathing problems and fever, but H1N1 was not diagnosed until after her death.</p>
<p>James Nesbitt, a VCH spokesman, said that "from Vancouver Coastal's point of view, there is no indication of negligence on the part of any staff."</p>
<p>But he said the health authority will meet with the family in December at their request, "as a final step before the review can be complete."</p>
<p>Nesbitt said all factors are taken into consideration when a VCH review is conducted.</p>
<p>To get an accurate picture, Nesbitt said VCH looked at the patient's underlying health conditions, and other treatments, the presence of H1N1 virus, and spoke to doctors, nurses and hospital administrators.</p>
<p>"The individual was in a high risk group for H1N1; she was asthmatic," said Nesbitt.</p>
<p>"VCH is reminding everyone who hasn't been inoculated to get an H1N1 shot."</p>

</p>
<p>Q: My cat is a seven-year-old neutered male Himalayan. He is mostly an indoor cat, but he likes to go outdoors when the weather is good. For a few weeks, he has been sneezing and has a bit of mucous discharge coming from his nose. He also has a bit of a cough about three or four times a day. He still eats well and is playful and active.</p>
<p>I have taken him to our vet a couple of times and, each time, he has put my cat on antibiotics, which didn't seem to help. The vet suspects a tumour or resistant infection and has suggested X-rays and a culture of the nasal discharge. What do you think the problem might be and what should be my next course of action?</p>
<p>A: Clinical signs such sneezing, coughing, and nasal discharge are typically associated with a respiratory problem. Sneezing generally relates to an upper respiratory tract problem (i.e. nose and throat), while coughing usually relates to a lower respiratory tract problem (i.e. lungs). Since the response to antibiotics was poor, the likelihood of this being a bacterial infection is reduced, but not out of the question, since this problem can still be due to an infection that involves a resistant strain of bacteria. Other possibilities include such problems as bronchitis, asthma, fungal infections, heartworm disease, parasites, tumours and viral infections. Cats will also cough if they have a heart problem called cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p>Certain viral problems, such as calici virus or rhinotracheitis virus, can cause signs similar to the ones you describe. Viral infections do not respond well to antibiotics. Once a cat has fought off one, they often suffer from recurrent episodes of coughing and sneezing for most of their lives. This is called a chronic carrier state and, during these episodes, they can spread the virus to other cats. With the recent discovery of a cat in Iowa that contracted H1N1 virus from its owners, there is also the possibility (albeit small) that your cat may have the H1N1 virus. If there is a history of someone in the family having had flu-like symptoms, mention this to your veterinarian.</p>
<p>Your veterinarian is quite right to suggest a bacterial culture and X-rays as the next logical step. X-rays will rule out any obstructions, tumours, foreign bodies or polyps in the nose, throat, or lungs as well as heart and lung problems. If the X-rays are not diagnostic, further diagnostic tests can be done. They include rhinoscopy, laryngoscopy, and bronchoscopy (looking at the sinuses, throat and lungs with a camera attached to a flexible hose), as well as ultrasound.</p>

</p>
<p>The .500 mark has never looked as good to the Ottawa 67's this year as it did Sunday.</p>
<p>Given the rough start to the season the 67's endured, though, being back on level ground was a welcome development.</p>
<p>The fact the red-hot team did it by notching its fifth consecutive victory, and against one of the Ontario Hockey League's top teams, made it all even sweeter.</p>
<p>"For us, we went into the game saying, 'If we win today, we're back to .500, we've won five in a row, we're a point out of first place in our division ... so it was a huge day for us getting two points, " coach Chris Byrne said after the 67's dumped the Kitchener Rangers 6-3 before an announced crowd of 9,552 at the Urbandale Centre.</p>
<p>"The fact that we beat a pretty good hockey team gives it even a little bit extra."</p>
<p>It was also a banner day individually for Tyler Toffoli, Dalton Smith and Thomas Nesbitt. They each scored two goals, including one apiece during a game-deciding span of three minutes 31 seconds in the second period.</p>
<p>Toffoli added two assists, and Smith had one.</p>
<p>Nesbitt scored once while the 67s were playing shorthanded and again when they were on the power play. One of Smith's markers also came with the man advantage.</p>
<p>Cody Lindsay set up three goals, Tyler Cuma recorded two assists and Chris Perugini earned his fifth victory in a row in goal with 21 saves.</p>
<p>Toffoli, who represented the OHL against Russia in the Subway Super Series game on Thursday in Barrie and will suit up again tonight, when the series resumes in Windsor, was named the No. 1 star.</p>
<p>"I thought he was electric on the ice (Sunday)," Byrne said. "He was really dynamic with the puck, he worked hard, he back-checked hard.</p>
<p>"It was a very good game for him."</p>
<p>Like the team, Toffoli got off to a slow start, with two points in his first seven contests. When National Hockey League Central Scouting released its preliminary rankings for the 2010 draft last week, his standing of 14th among OHL skaters -- behind teammate Ryan Martindale (No. 7) and ahead of Smith (No. 20) -- showed he had suffered.</p>
<p>Sunday's outing, though, gave Toffoli 23 points in 22 games.</p>
<p>"Our whole team's confidence is really high," Toffoli said after the 67's improved to 10-10-3-2. "My linemates, Linday and Smitty, we're playing really well together. We're going hard to the net, we're working hard in the corners and, for all of us, we're putting up the points.</p>
<p>"Hopefully, the next time the rankings come out, I'm higher up."</p>
<p>The Rangers (16-5-1-2) possess the second-best record in the OHL's Western Conference and are third overall, but against the streaking 67's they looked ordinary.</p>
<p>Mavric Parks of Eganville started for Kitchener, but he was replaced by Brandon Maxwell after giving up four goals on 19 shots.</p>
<p>Only Swedish rookie Gabriel Landeskog, with two goals, and Jeremy Morin, on the power play, managed to beat Perugini.</p>
<p>The 67's will try to make it six in a row on Friday night, when they play host to the Oshawa Generals.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Stop 'toxic' flyers, Liberals plead; 'Enough is enough,' Ignatieff says after Tories claim in political pamphlet that his party is anti-Semitic</b>
</div><div>Susan Delacourt   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>521 words</div><div>23 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A06</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff is demanding that the Commons crack down on what he calls "toxic political abuse" in a taxpayer-financed system of political flyers circulated to Canadian households.</p>
<p>Prompted by a wave of pamphlets that went out in the last week, painting Liberal MPs as anti-Semitic, Ignatieff has written to Commons Speaker Peter Milliken with calls for strict limits to be placed on the "10-per-center" pamphlets, as they're called.</p>
<p>It is the latest flare-up in the Liberal-Conservative battle over negative advertising.</p>
<p>Liberals are asking that MPs no longer be allowed to send these flyers beyond their own ridings and that the pamphlets bear the name of the party leader, plus his or her endorsement of the content.</p>
<p>Conservatives are not expected to endorse the proposal - Democratic Reform Minister Steven Fletcher said over the summer that the 10 per centers were an important contribution to political discourse.</p>
<p>Fred DeLorey, a Conservative party spokesman, said Sunday that an effective MP has to communicate with both constituents and Canadians across the country and that "an informed electorate is essential to a healthy, functioning democracy."</p>
<p>But Milliken may be open to the Liberal demand - twice in the past several months, he has ruled that pamphlets sent out by the Conservatives have violated the privileges of MPs in other parties.</p>
<p>The Speaker ruled last week, for instance, in favour of a complaint by NDP MP Peter Stoffer, who was portrayed - wrongly - in Conservative pamphlets as an opponent of moves to eliminate the long-gun registry. Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore) voted with the Conservatives in that private member's bill.</p>
<p>Conservatives aren't the only ones to use the system for attacks ads - this fall, the Liberals sent out highly inflammatory attacks on the government, related to the military and H1N1 flu preparation, under the names of Liberal MPs Hedy Fry and Carolyn Bennett.</p>
<p>But it was last week's pamphlets, sent into Liberal ridings with large Jewish populations and characterizing Liberals as anti-Semitic, that led Ignatieff to write Milliken.</p>
<p>Ignatieff, in his letter, describes it as a "shocking new low" and writes: "It is time to put an end to this toxic political abuse ..."</p>
<p>Among other things, the pamphlets portray Liberals as active participants in a conference in Durban, South Africa, where anti-Semitism was on open display. (Liberal MP Irwin Cotler was later thanked by Israel for staying at the conference to defend the nation.)</p>
<p>MPs can send out "householders" four times a year into their ridings. But to ensure small parties weren't overwhelmed by this privilege, rules also allow flyers to be circulated by parties into ridings they don't hold, up to 10 per cent of the votes they received in the last election. Thus, the name "10 per centers."</p>

</div><div>Trish Crawford   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>985 words</div><div>23 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>E01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Swine flu.</p>
<p>Laryngitis.</p>
<p>Sprained ankles.</p>
<p>Yikes! The Footloose cast and crew at Toronto's Cardinal Carter Academy for the Arts are dropping like flies and the first performance is a matinee Tuesday.</p>
<p>After months of rehearsals, the show is ready to go - if only everyone could stay well. Co-director Sheila O'Brien admits she wonders what else could happen.</p>
<p>"There are always challenges and illnesses. But it is the extreme nature of these illnesses, staff too, that has been so unusual. I wake up a lot at night."</p>
<p>Both school choreographers were ill, as were members of the orchestra, missing weeks at a time. Many students had flu and colds.</p>
<p>Nikolas Koschany has only one line: "Good morning, Reverend." Nonetheless, he fretted during a bout of H1N1 "that I would lose my voice."</p>
<p>That's what happened to one of the male leads, Frank Alfiere, who got laryngitis. Slated to play the evening performances on Nov. 25 and Nov. 28, Frank couldn't utter a peep for a week.</p>
<p>His doctor recommended steam treatments and they are working.</p>
<p>"I have steam for 15 minutes three times a day and I'm much better," Frank says, in a somewhat raspy voice. "It's been a lot of stress."</p>
<p>He has 40 family members and friends who have shelled out $20 to watch him perform on Saturday - an event that he says "will be my most memorable experience." He is one of two leads playing Ren, the city boy who moves to a small town where he must fight to have dancing allowed at the school's prom.</p>
<p>Mirabella Sundar Singh, who plays Ren's girlfriend Ariel, was knocked out for a week by a severe cold, while the other female lead, Christi-Anne Nazareth, sprained her left ankle twice during rehearsals.</p>
<p>Victor Fantaccione was the "last man standing" of all of the leads. The eldest son of Italian immigrants (and the only one in his family in the arts), Victor plays Ren in the double-cast play. It's the largest role - the play, after all, is Ren's story - and the character is on stage almost the entire two hours.</p>
<p>Given that Victor has had to sing the entire score with two different casts every day, he is exhausted. He has been worried about straining his voice, too.</p>
<p>When it all got too much last week, another student stood in for Victor so he could have a break for a couple of hours. He did his homework, he says, "and then I felt much better."</p>
<p>There have been light-hearted moments, too, Victor says, citing the first time he put on old-fashioned roller skates for the Burger Blast scene and almost fell into the orchestra pit.</p>
<p>"However bad a mood I'm in, hearing Tom Stesko say, 'Party in your pants, what are you thinking?' in the junkyard scene never fails at making me happy again."</p>
<p>Paul Burry, who plays Willard, is in awe - "Victor has worked so hard," he says. The cast has been unsettled by all the illnesses and mishaps, Burry says, "but students are very dramatic anyway."</p>
<p>The drama, the new friendships, the experience of being on stage - some for the first time in their lives - are creating memorable moments for the more than 80 students in the play.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Staples says she and fellow students practised "method acting" by actually playing a game of poker on stage during their card-playing scene.</p>
<p>"It was the most fun I've had in this process," she says.</p>
<p>Braeden Soltys, who describes himself as a "very small, scrawny kid," is revelling in his fight scene against "this big, buff guy." Needless to say, he gets thrown around a bit.</p>
<p>"The actions of this scene are hilarious," he says.</p>
<p>For Katie Ross, "The biggest surprise was when I danced in heels for the first time and truly realized how hard it is."</p>
<p>Mary Rupert is wilting under the demands of being in two shows - she also appeared in a Toronto Youth Theatre production this fall. She will not double-book again in the future, she says, but is delighted with the friendships she has made in the cast.</p>
<p>Because the play takes place in the '80s, students have been scouring their parents' closets for prom dresses, skinny ties and cowboy attire for the costumes. One parent snagged 25 cowboy hats for $1 each at a flea market, while another arranged for powder-blue tuxes to be loaned to the students.</p>
<p>Rebekah Lange is thrilled with her principal's costume - "If it has shoulder pads, this must be the '80s."</p>
<p>Without proper dressing rooms until show time, the students have been putting their costumes on everywhere they can find a private space. Paige Lansky has solved the modesty problem by wearing shorts and a tank top underneath her clothes.</p>
<p>"It's exciting that it is finally all coming together," the Grade 11 drama major says, summing up the general mood of the cast,</p>
<p>The lines have all been learned, the music perfected and the stage crew are ready to shine their spotlights on the show.</p>

</div><div>By Carol Sanders    </div>

</p>
<p>Most of the Brandon University women's basketball team -- including its head coach -- were sidelined in Winnipeg on Saturday by a fast but furious bout with the flu that sent one player to hospital.</p>
<p>"Thirteen of 17 kids were sick," Kirk DeFazio, Brandon's athletic director, said Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>"They were told it's intestinal flu."</p>
<p>DeFazio said the sick team members had recovered by Sunday and were on their way home to Brandon.</p>
<p>"It was violent vomiting and diarrhea and it hit everyone," said head coach Jaime Hickson. "It hit me, and from two o'clock I puked solidly till seven o'clock.</p>
<p>"When it hit at two we were already at the Duckworth Centre," added Hickson, who was unable to coach. "I don't even know the final score," she said. "We lost."</p>
<p>Only seven members of the Bobcats dressed for the evening game. The visitors fell 70-64 to the Wesmen.</p>
<p>Some of the Bobcats who were well enough to play immediately got sick when the game ended.</p>
<p>"The adrenaline kept them going... they started dropping like flies after the game," said Hickson.</p>
<p>"We still had kids (coming) down with it till 3 a.m."</p>
<p>The player who was sent to hospital fell ill right after the game. The violence of the vomiting left her hyperventilating, said Hickson.</p>
<p>To be safe, they called 911.</p>
<p>"She was sedated and they put fluids into her and she's a million bucks today," the coach said.</p>
<p>The illness wasn't caused by food poisoning because it affected team members who ate different foods from different places and stayed in different rooms, said Hickson.</p>
<p>She's sure it was some kind of gastrointestinal flu.</p>
<p>"The hospital staff said it's common right now," she said.</p>
<p>The team has been vigilant lately about hygiene and preventing the spread of flu, especially with the spectre of H1N1, said Hickson.</p>
<p>The Bobcats won't be practising today, she said.</p>
<p>They may go to the gym for a light jog Tuesday back at BU.</p>

<p>Catch the wind</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> claims the St. Joseph's wind farm will be smaller than the original proposal, reduced from 300 megawatts to 138 megawatts. With Manitoba being one of the windiest places in the country (especially southwestern Manitoba), Hydro should allow for faster tendering of wind projects to be built by private corporations, the public or rural municipalities.</p>
<p>These organizations will provide the financial backing to build the wind farms, rather than having the government finance the upfront costs, as it is doing with the hydro dams in northern Manitoba. All <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> has to do is follow Ontario's lead and buy the power back from the companies at an increased rate above the six or seven cents a kilowatt-hour Hydro is currently offering. If Manitoba is to reach its target of 1,000 megawatts by 2015, it had better buy power at a higher price or companies will build their wind farms elsewhere. (Ontario is currently offering 13.5 cents per kilowatt-hour to wind-energy developers.)</p>
<p>The Manitoba government should invest in wind, solar, and geothermal energy rather than hydro, because it helps to offset our dependence on one type of "clean energy." What happens if we have a drought, as was suggest by a whistleblower recently? Other clean power sources could make up the difference. Additionally, the power lost in transmission is likely to be lower for wind farms because the power is more likely to be produced in the more densely populated southern Manitoba, which consumes the bulk of the province's electricity. Germany has an integrated system of wind, solar, biogas and hydro all throughout the country. The German and Ontario examples provide a model that we could follow here in Manitoba -- if only this government was really committed to the idea of a diversified clean-energy portfolio.</p>

<p>Leave library alone</p>
<p>Is there no stopping Mayor Sam Katz and his city hatchet? Library services are now on the chopping block. By contracting out library services, we stand to lose much. Libraries are fundamental to a society and the culture of a city should not be lost on out-of-town cataloguers. Giving up this local autonomy is just another way of failing to recognize the value of Winnipeg and its citizens.</p>

<p>Freedom in danger</p>
<p>Canada's constitutional monarchy is going down. There is an understandable cause for the fact that Canadian freedom of expression is being reduced while America's is increasing. Canada's constitutional monarchy is less democratic since the end of 2008.</p>
<p>The powers of Queen Elizabeth II represented by Gov. Gen. Michaëlle Jean are partly limited by the Constitution in Canada. If Ms. Jean's office is now largely ceremonial, she still has a lot of power in some areas of our government. She has the responsibility of choosing the prime minister. Ms. Jean opens and closes the Parliament and has the authority to summon it, adjourn it, dissolve it, and signs the bills it passes. On Dec. 4, 2008, she agreed to prorogue Parliament and saved the minority government of Stephen Harper, knowing that the absolute majority of MPs were against it. That day, the power of the Queen curbed democracy in Canada.</p>
<p>Remember that the 105 Canadian senators are not elected by the population but appointed by the governor general on the recommendation of the prime minister. They can hold their position until they are 75 years old. The Senate, sharing the function of lawmaking with the House of Commons, is now filled with people who had the prime value of serving their party and being rewarded for it. No Canadian can compare such a political system to the United States' model without blushing. Democracy in Canada is a work in progress while the election of Barack Obama shows that the United States' system is far better. As the Reporters Without Borders' index of freedom of the press shows, there is still a lot of work to do to drag Canada's constitutional monarchy to a modern democratic level.</p>

<p>Charge them</p>
<p>Three people have been found guilty of smuggling ecstasy into North Dakota from Winnipeg. They are serving sentences in the United States. They were apparently smuggling guns from North Dakota into Winnipeg. I strongly feel that upon their release, if they attempt to return to Canada, they must face charges of bringing illegal guns into the country. They are accomplices in any crime committed using these weapons and should be charged as such. They should serve time for any crime connected to them and serve sentences consecutively.</p>

<p>Shame on HSC</p>
<p>As a proud graduate of the Winnipeg General/Health Sciences Centre School of Nursing, I hang my head in shame at the treatment of the gentleman who had brain surgery and was turfed out of HSC. He then became a much more debilitated patient on his readmission as a stroke victim. The nursing staff should be ashamed of the way they treated this patient. Where was the compassion of their profession, where was the discharge planning? The top- heavy administration of HSC has a lot to be accountable for. Thankfully, he will no doubt end up in an institution where nurses' aides, who have not forgotten how to deal with the elderly and sick, will care for him.</p>

<p>What about issues?</p>
<p>Re: Liberals stand by Israel: Ignatieff (Nov.19). I am very disappointed in your coverage of Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff's appearance in Winnipeg on Nov. 18. The photograph is pathetic. I attended the dinner and don't see any coverage of the speech delivered by the party leader, where he emphasized the need for improved education, "green-job" training and research. I simply can't understand why your paper chose to cover only the publicly funded propaganda distributed by members of the Conservative party.</p>

<div>Anatomy Of A Deal</div>

</p>
<p>Each week, the Financial Post revisits CBC's previous week's episode of Dragons' Den. We capture what the cameras didn't and in the process provide a case study for readers, zeroing in on what pitchers and dragons were thinking and what the challenges for the deal are going forward.</p>
<p>The pitch: Wendy Johannson and Claudia Harvey are friends and share many interests: rock climbing, mountain biking and gardening, among them. They also shared a frustration. "Both Claudia and I are very active in sports and outdoor activities and we like to get our nails done and for years we could not find a decent glove to protect the investment we were making in our nails," Ms. Johannson says.</p>
<p>"We know that sounds girly, but we talked to a lot of women who had the same dilemma. We started to look at the market and discovered women in North America spend over $1.4-billion a year on their nails. It's huge."</p>
<p>At a barbecue in September 2007 with their families they seriously discussed pulling their extensive business experience in sales, marketing, customer relationships and distribution together to fill that need. They dug deeper, buying gloves from specialty and hardware stores, and garden centres across the country and cataloguing what they found.</p>
<p>"We turned them inside out, looked at the materials, price point, how they were made and where they were made," Ms. Harvey says.</p>
<p>"We approached an industrial manufacturer in Guelph, Ont., and worked with their team to develop a glove that was unique in the market."</p>
<p>That glove is the premier product of Dig It Apparel, the company they cofounded and incorporated in May 2008.</p>
<p>"Our main focus is on all utility work: hosing down the driveway, washing your car, cleaning your home, sorting recycling, unpacking boxes," Ms. Johannson says.</p>
<p>"They are fantastic for golf because of the grips on the palm. People have used them for sailing and kayaking because they can get wet but dry quickly and still protect your fingertips. They are made from recycled material so you don't have to worry about allergies to latex or that type of thing."</p>
<p>The gloves are also proving to be a hit with people who have arthritis. "Their hands don't swell up because it's a breathable product," Ms. Harvey says. "We designed the gloves after five focus groups and five different prototypes. The glove is extremely form fitting and men can wear them, too."</p>
<p>The pair say Dig It gloves are a relevant product for a very broad market. Yet, they braved the Den. "When we looked at our product and our brand, we realized a product category does not exist for Dig It," Ms. Johannson says.</p>
<p>"We needed a way to get our name and product out there quickly and cost effectively. We were fans and recognized if we went on the show, there would be a great opportunity to raise brand awareness and get great exposure."</p>
<p>The deal: The entrepreneurs went in asking for $50,000 for a 10% stake. On camera, Jim Treliving offered $50,000 for a 25% stake, and Kevin O'Leary countered with $50,000 for 10% plus a 3% royalty.</p>
<p>They took Kevin's deal, and, after further negotiations during the due diligence got exactly what they asked for: $50,000 for a 10% stake and no royalty.</p>
<p>"The deal we took on camera was good, but the deal we now have is great," Ms. Johannson says. Since filming, she and Ms. Harvey have appeared twice on The Shopping Channel-- once with Mr. O'Leary-- are selling through retail partners in more than 75 stores, have launched a line of safety sunglasses called Eye Dig it and are preparing to launch Dig It in the City, an urban glove that protect against H1N1 and other viruses.</p>
<p>What the dragon has to say:</p>
<p>"I like their product, I like their market, but I like them even more," Mr. O'Leary says.</p>
<p>"I have a rock solid management team in these two women. They have a strong vision for serving a market they know very well and because they do they are putting the product into retailers I hadn't even thought of. We see very few entrepreneurs like these two. These are women executives who have designed and built a strong product and company. I believe in them, their product and their vision. There is no royalty component to the deal any more. I am provided operating cash flow and I am comfortable my money is not in harm's way."</p>
<p>The challenge, he says, is to build the business in Canada and find the right time to enter the U.S. market. Meanwhile, "they are increasing their volumes, driving manufacturing costs down," says Mr. O'Leary, who is also doing what he can to boost sales. "I have a pair of the original gloves and I use them to gas up my car. I've sold 10 pairs just at the gas station. A product that sells itself is magic. Everyone who sees them wants them."</p>
<p>What the expert thinks:</p>
<p>Chris Van Staveren, partner, transaction service, KPMG Enterprise Services, sees a few more challenges: "This is a luxury good in a tough economic time and there are a whole bunch of cheaper alternatives. You also have to ask, is the market too niche?" Also, $50,000 is not a lot of money. "If The Shopping Channel can guarantee significant sales, they are going to need much more money to stock up."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The new ethno-politics</b>
</div><div>National Post</div>
<div>771 words</div><div>23 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Who says the Tories can't do ethno-politics? Throughout the Chretien and Martin years, the Liberals had a lock on urban ethnic constituencies. Sikhs, Jews, Tamils, Somalians, Ukrainians, Arabs: The Liberal Party's urban machines were staffed by a tightly corralled rainbow coalition recruited and programmed at mosques, temples and community centres. On election day, the Tories and their Reform precursors -- who'd been painted as bigots by the Liberals and the media -- had no chance.</p>
<p>But times are a-changing. As demonstrated by Stephen Harper's high-profile trip to India, and the flap over Jewish-targeted Tory propaganda leaflets here at home, ethnopolitics is now a competitive game. Overall, that's a boon for Canadian democracy, even if you wouldn't know it from the grubby way that the battle is playing out.</p>
<p>The Tories have some catching up to do, certainly. Back in the 1990s, the Liberals declared themselves the party of the immigrant, and kept the floodgates open for up to 300,000 newcomers a year -- more immigrants,</p>
<p>in per capita terms, than any other developed nation on earth. Cash was dispensed freely to just about any community organization looking to put on a fashion show, parade or food fair. Want to get gramma in from grammastan? No problem. Your local MP would help you fill out the family reunification paperwork.</p>
<p>On foreign shores, Canada acted as an "honest broker" (which is to say, an amoral stooge) between terrorist groups and terror-stricken nations. Jean Chretien literally embraced Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Paul Martin showed up at a fundraising event for a group that U.S. intelligence linked with the Tamil Tigers. Some even did photo-ops at events where Sikh extremists glorified the "martyrs" who blew up Air India flight 182.</p>
<p>To his great credit, Michael Ignatieff put a stop to all this. Under his leadership, the Liberals became far more selective in their embrace of ethnic advocacy groups. Earlier this year, when the Tamil Tigers terrorist group was on its last legs in Sri Lanka, Mr. Ignatieff refused to take up the group's cause. He has stood foursquare behind Israel, maintaining the recent Canadian tradition of opposing UN resolutions singling out the Jewish state. Indeed, when it comes to foreign policy, Mr. Ignatieff is easily the most hawkish Liberal chief in a generation.</p>
<p>The result: Canada now has not one but two major-party leaders who are principled, pro-Israel and pro-American. Even the NDP seems to have ratchetted down its traditional rhetoric (which seems downright odd, given that Mr. Ignatieff's swing to the right on foreign policy has provided Jack Layton's party with such a massive opportunity to scoop up urban Canada's various Muslim, art-house, pacifist, NGO-type, and college-campus constituencies).</p>
<p>This is a welcome development. But it is also creating an odd and slightly unseemly phenomenon: The Liberals and Conservatives falling over one another in a slavish bid to court ethnic groups that tend to align themselves strongly with this pro-Zionist, anti-terror orientation -- including Indian Hindus and moderate (i. e., non-Khalistani) Sikhs. Jews, who form an important voting bloc in perhaps half a dozen ridings in Toronto and Montreal, are getting the most attention.</p>
<p>It is this dynamic that led us to this week's brouhaha over a Tory "ten-percenter" flyer that trumpets Tory support for Israel while suggesting (falsely) that the Liberals can't be trusted on the Middle East file. While nothing in the flyer is a flat-out lie (let alone legally actionable, as some especially apoplectic Liberals have suggested), the references to the Liberals are dated and overwrought.</p>
<p>It is, in other words, standard political propaganda, no better or worse than the absurd talking point, bandied about by a Liberal organizer, that H1N1 would prove to be the "Conservative's Hurricane Katrina."</p>
<p>Political parties say nasty, torqued things about one another all the time. The only thing that's unusual here is that this particular piece of nasty, torqued messaging targets a core Liberal constituency that has, for the first time in decades, suddenly become an object of real competition. And it is this that has the Liberals panicked. It was one thing for the Liberals to lose the West, the rural vote and much of Quebec. But now, their very survival is in question: If they lose their monopoly on ethnic Canada, their support level will begin falling into NDP territory.</p>
<p>Deal with it, Mr. Ignatieff. The era of one-party rule in Canada's ethnic communities is over.</p>

</div><div>The Leader-Post</div>

</p>
<p>Here is some H1N1 information from www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca], a Health Canada website, where you will be able to find out more about the flu.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is a new strain of pandemic influenza that is different from the seasonal flu. People have no natural immunity to protect against this virus. The H1N1 flu virus emerged in April 2009 and surveillance of its spread shows that it is affecting more young and healthy people than the regular seasonal flu, which normally affects seniors and young children. People with underlying medical conditions, and pregnant women, may be at a greater risk for severe illness.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus -- also known as human swine influenza -- is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs. This virus usually affects pigs, but has been transferred to humans.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus has caused primarily mild illness in Canada, but Canadians need to be prepared to respond to a potentially more severe form of the virus that may emerge this fall.</p>
<p>How is it spread?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is contagious and is spread the same way as regular seasonal influenza. This happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes and their germs enter the nose, eyes, or throat of another person. The germs can also rest on hard surfaces such as counters and doorknobs, and can be picked up on hands and transmitted to the respiratory system when someone touches his mouth and/or nose. It is not possible to catch it by eating pork or pork products or through blood transfusions.</p>
<p>Contagiousness</p>
<p>More research is being done on how long a person can be infectious (be able to spread the virus to others), but it is believed that this period is for one day before the onset of symptoms and continues for approximately seven days after symptoms have started. The time it takes between being infected and experiencing symptoms is between two and seven days.</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>- Almost always</p>
<p>Cough and fever</p>
<p>- Common</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle aches</p>
<p>Sore throat</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>Decreased appetite</p>
<p>Runny nose</p>
<p>- Sometimes</p>
<p>Nausea</p>
<p>Vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>- Wash hands often.</p>
<p>- Keep common surfaces disinfected.</p>
<p>- Cough and sneeze into your arm, instead of into your hand.</p>
<p>- If you are sick, stay home until your symptoms are gone and you feel well enough to participate in all activities.</p>
<p>- If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant, have underlying health problems, or if your symptoms get worse, contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant or have underlying health problems contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are otherwise healthy, you should stay home to recover. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience difficulty breathing or serious shortness of breath, it is important to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Antivirals are drugs used for the early treatment of influenza. If taken shortly after getting sick (within 48 hours), they can reduce influenza symptoms, shorten the length of illness and potentially reduce the serious complications of influenza. Antivirals do not prevent you from getting sick.</p>
<p>Canada has a National Antiviral Stockpile of 55 million doses of two antiviral drugs -- Tamiflu and Relenza. Both are effective in treating H1N1 flu virus. This stockpile is enough for all Canadians who will need and want treatment.</p>
<p>Antivirals are recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe illness, and for people at risk of severe disease. Your doctor will decide if treatment is right for you.</p>
<p>Vaccination</p>
<p>Influenza vaccines (also called flu shots) help you to prevent getting sick by introducing your body to a weakened or dead version of the virus to teach your body to build immunity to it.</p>

<p>Question: My mother and I have severe reactions to most fish. She starts to swell and I get violently ill with diarrhea, vomiting and a very severe headache. I understand there have been cases of people going into anaphylactic shock. Should my mother and I wait to have the H1N1 without the adjuvant like the pregnant women and children or is it safe for us to go ahead and take the adjuvant H1N1 shot?</p>
<p>Answer: It is always advisable for those who experience a severe allergy to eggs or any other food or medication to discuss their condition with their health-care provider (physician or immunization provider). An individual assessment is always done to ensure the right vaccine is given and any extra precautions (e.g., longer observation period following immunization) are identified and available before the vaccine is administered. Additionally, further consultation may be done with the local health region medical health officer or an allergy specialist.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>When to take sick child to ER</b>
</div><div>Rong-Gong Lin   </div>
<div>Los Angeles Times</div>
<div>730 words</div><div>23 November 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>C11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>For parents worried about a child sick with the flu, deciding when to head to the ER can be difficult.</p>
<p>Unlike the typical seasonal flu, which is generally most dangerous to infants and the elderly, the H1N1 strain has hit children, teenagers and young adults unusually hard.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated earlier this month that more children have died of the H1N1 flu than people over 65, about 540 children as of mid-October compared with 440 seniors. And the agency recently reported that flu-related pediatric deaths were continuing to rise. An estimated 2,900 adults between 18 and 64 have died. Most years, 90 per cent of people who die of the flu are 65 or older, officials said.</p>
<p>The most serious cases, however, remain unusual. As concern grows about the danger of H1N1, doctors also are seeing an uptick in what they call the "worried well," parents who seek emergency care for healthy children.</p>
<p>So when should you take your child to the emergency room. Doctors say parents and guardians should assess how sick a child is in part based on experience</p>
<p>"Is there something really different about your child that's different from the seven or eight viral infections your kid gets every year? Those are the changes to look out for," said Dr. Mark Morocco, associate residency director for emergency medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Warning signs include any significant difficulty breathing, an inability to drink fluids or urinate for more than six hours, any change in the colour of the mouth or lips, or unusual behaviourial changes, such as a crying child who cannot be consoled, or children who don't wake up or walk or talk normally.</p>
<p>If any of those symptoms show up in children, Morocco said, parents should take them to the ER, noting that "respiratory infections are often things that are the most life-threatening in children."</p>
<p>Lung inflammation is particularly dangerous to infants and young children because their airways are smaller. According to the California Department of Public Health, the flu virus replicates in the airways and lungs, causing them to swell. The inflammation makes it difficult for the lungs to work, reducing the body's ability to take oxygen into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Experts are telling clinicians to treat the H1N1 strain differently than they would the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>In a Journal of the American Medical Association editorial published earlier this month, former CDC director Julie Louise Gerberding wrote that patients who have a five- or six-day history of flu-like illness and whose ability to breathe is worsening "appear to be at risk for rapid deterioration" and should be treated with antiviral drugs and admitted to the hospital.</p>
<p>"Clinicians should not be falsely reassured by previous good health, young age, and absence of major comorbidities because these characteristics do not exclude the potential for respiratory failure and death," Gerberding wrote.</p>
<p>The CDC has also warned that some physicians are not prescribing antiviral drugs to H1N1 patients, pointing to studies that show that about 25 per cent of hospitalized patients with lab confirmed-H1N1 did not receive drugs like Tamiflu.</p>
<p>Even among those who did get antivirals, medication was often delayed for one or two days after they were admitted to the hospital, the CDC said. California health officials have also said that antiviral medication can reduce mortality even when given late, which is defined as being more than 48 hours after flu symptoms begin.</p>
<p>While most people who are hospitalized or have died of H1N1 have underlying medical illness, a significant proportion of H1N1 victims are otherwise healthy.</p>
<p>"What's surprising about this flu is ... we're seeing patients between the ages of 10 and 47 with no underlying medical problems that are getting into trouble. And that's scary for us because it's hard to know who is going to get in trouble," said Dr. Gail Carruthers, director of the pediatric emergency department at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center and Miller Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>Sometimes, patients will report flu-like symptoms for as few as three hours or as long as two weeks and then become significantly worse quickly. Their lungs begin to fail and fill up with fluid, requiring intensive care.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Wait times too long</b>
</div><div>Nadeem Esmail   </div>
<div>Special to The Windsor Star</div>
<div>706 words</div><div>23 November 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>News reports from across the country recently highlighted the plight of thousands of Canadians lining up and waiting for H1N1 vaccinations while politicians of all stripes cast about for someone to take the blame.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, wait times for medically necessary health services across Canada continue to remain unnecessarily high, but you'll find few politicians willing to discuss this issue in a realistic manner.</p>
<p>The Fraser Institute's annual survey of hospital waiting lists released this month showed that total wait time in 2009 is still 73 per cent longer than it was back in 1993, despite the fact that health spending per person has increased by 41 per cent since then. Simply put, the public health care system is still failing Canadians.</p>
<p>That Canadians are required to endure a median wait time of 16.1 weeks from GP referral to treatment by a specialist in the developed world's second most expensive universal access health care program should be considered unacceptable.</p>
<p>So should the fact that wait times remain historically high in spite of substantial increases in health spending across Canada over time.</p>
<p>This second point is critical in understanding why the small reduction in wait times in 2009, compared to 2008, is not something to celebrate.</p>
<p>Looked at another way, the 113 day total median wait time from GP to treatment in 2009 is the same as it was back in 2000-01, despite the fact that provincial health expenditures per Canadian have increased 29 per cent over that period, after adjusting for inflation.</p>
<p>Canadians, through their tax dollars, are spending more than ever on health care and yet are experiencing wait times that are just as long as they were at the start of the decade, an outcome that is hardly a sign of success.</p>
<p>Despite a minor improvement in wait times and despite the many excuses offered by defenders of the status quo, Canada's health care system is not delivering good value for taxpayer investments. Canada maintains a relatively expensive health care system yet leaves Canadians to endure relatively poor access to physicians and medical technologies, cares for them using far too many old and outdated pieces of medical equipment, and requires Canadians to suffer some of the longest queues for treatment in the developed world.</p>
<p>Importantly, there are seven developed nations that spend the same as or less than Canada on health care but manage to deliver universal access to health care services without queues for treatment.</p>
<p>Patients in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg and Switzerland all receive wait-list free access to health care services regardless of their ability to pay.</p>
<p>These nations all share a common approach to health care policy based on private competition and appropriate financial incentives for patients and providers.</p>
<p>That is, patients are free to choose for themselves whether their care provider will be a public or private hospital, all within the universal health insurance system. Patients in these nations are also free to purchase the care they desire privately if they wish to do so.</p>
<p>Finally, patients must share in the cost of the care they consume, which encourages them to make more informed decisions about when and where it is best to access the health care system.</p>
<p>By pursuing an approach to health care policy that has often been falsely labelled as the "Americanization" of health care in Canada, these nations are able to deliver what many Canadians might consider the impossible dream: a wait-list free universal health care system for the same or less cost than Canada's health care system.</p>
<p>This reality exposes the failure of Canada's health care system when it comes to dealing with queues for medical treatment.</p>
<p>The fact that wait times have fallen to the level experienced nearly a decade ago following sizable real increases in health spending is not a sign of sensible investments. Rather it is a clear indication that Canada's health care system continues to fail Canadians.</p>
<p>Nadeem Esmail is the Director of Health System Performance Studies at the Fraser Institute and author of the 19th edition of Waiting Your Turn: Hospital Waiting Lists in Canada.</p>

<p>I would really like the medical officers to quit saying in their news releases that patients who pass away from H1N1 had underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>Why does that matter? Just because I, and many other people, have underlying medical conditions doesn't make it OK that we die of H1N1.</p>
<p>Perhaps if these people with underlying medical conditions had received the flu shots that spouses of health workers were given earlier on, they would still be having meals with their families, raising their children and continuing to live with their underlying medical conditions.</p>

<p>BIN THERE, DONE THAT "I have concluded that while this conduct is unacceptable and wrong, it should not be stigmatized as criminal." -- Provincial court Judge Hugh Harradence, in a written decision that cleared a man in Prince Albert for helping himself to a handful of snacks from the bulk containers in a grocery store.</p>

For instance, the night he got stabbed, had the handler not kept him from going back to re-engage the guy that stabbed him, he was bound and determined to go and have another crack at this guy." -- Steve Kaye, of the Saskatoon Police Service canine unit, which includes a German shepherd named Icon, who has survived, in separate incidents, knife wounds and (earlier) an attempted drowning.</p>

<p>THAT'S THE SPIRIT "My Captain Hook is only my Captain Hook. The hope is that he'll be at once frightening, menacing, pathetic and sympathetic. It's a lot to shoot for.

<p>SIZE MATTERS "Come on people, wake up! Such a venue would be out of date before the doors opened!" -- Dan Brooks, in a letter to the editor, expressing the opinion that a 33,000-seat domed stadium for Regina would be inadequate.</p>

</p>
<p>Quebec's vaccination campaign will be expanded to include everyone sooner than expected, Health Minister Yves Bolduc says.</p>
<p>The statement was made during a news conference yesterday at which health officials announced nearly 2 million Quebecers have been vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus since the campaign began Oct. 26.</p>
<p>"We foresee being able to soon offer the vaccine to the whole population, meaning all the people who are not part of a risk group," Bolduc said.</p>
<p>"That last step should bring us towards covering a very large portion of the population."</p>
<p>People between 19 and 65 years old who don't suffer from a chronic illness were to be eligible for shots as of Dec. 7. Bolduc did not specify a new date but advised people to watch for announcements on a regional basis. (See our chart on how to get updates.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, centres in the Beauce region began offering vaccinations to people of all ages yesterday, according to media reports.</p>
<p>For now, healthy people between 19 and 65 are the only ones left to wait for a shot after health officials moved up - to Nov. 20 - the date on which all seniors can get a vaccine.</p>
<p>Bolduc said that if the supply of doses to the province is maintained at its current level, everyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get one before the holiday season.</p>
<p>He said the program of busing students to vaccination centres from their schools is progressing well. Nearly 400,000 students have been vaccinated through the program, he said.</p>
<p>At Olympic Stadium, the vaccination centre is closed today because of the Alouettes game and will remain closed tomorrow.</p>

</p>
<p>If at first you don't succeed in killing your husband, try, try again --and maybe even again.</p>
<p>It's a truism that has landed Dalia Dippolito in a load of trouble with the police in Boynton Beach, Fla.</p>
<p>The cops allege that on three separate occasions, Dalia did attempt to dispatch her wealthy husband, Michael Dippolito--mere months after they were married.</p>
<p>The first attempted homicide involved putting antifreeze in his coffee. That toxic brew did give him a stomach ache, but he was otherwise still standing afterward.</p>
<p>The second attempt attracted the attention of the police and all sorts of media coverage. That was in August when Dalia unwittingly hired two undercover cops, allegedly to kill Michael. Her tearful reaction to the news of Michael's supposed "death" was recorded on video by a crew from the TV show Cops, after which an arrest quickly followed.</p>
<p>Undeterred by that development, she is alleged to have mounted a third attempt by hiring another hit man to finish the job, reports the Palm Beach Post. However he, too, was a cop.</p>
<p>Dalia is under house arrest at her mom's house. Not surprisingly, Michael is suing for divorce.</p>
<p>Bad form</p>
<p>"Murder is always a mistake. One should never do anything one cannot talk about after dinner." --Oscar Wilde</p>
<p>Dead prove elusive</p>
<p>Police in Amsterdam might need a refresher course on how to find dead bodies after one eluded them during a search of the corpse's apartment.</p>
<p>According to Der Telegraaf, in a story brought to our attention by astute reader Shanta Meeder, the police broke into the home of an 85-year-old woman after she had been reported missing--yet they could find no trace of her.</p>
<p>They did find the woman's body the next day, however, after they were alerted to the smell. The woman was found under her bed. She died of natural causes.</p>
<p>On the job</p>
<p>When a worker found $40,000 US worth of rare coins on the grounds of a Catholic shrine in Maryland, its custodians thought they had been blessed with a large and secretive donation.</p>
<p>Not quite.</p>
<p>Evidently, it was the intent a woman visiting the National Shrine Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes at Mount St. Mary's University to leave the bags of money under the ever-vigilant eye of the Blessed Virgin Mary while she was out of town.</p>
<p>The woman returned a week later to reclaim her treasure, reports the New York Daily News. The school's security chief persuaded her it might be wiser next time to leave the money in a bank's safety deposit box.</p>
<p>When pensions aren't enough</p>
<p>Speaking of banks, FBI agents in San Diego are in pursuit of a bank robber who's been dubbed the "Geezer Bandit"--mainly because he appears to be in his 70s.</p>
<p>The elderly, thin, grey-haired gent is suspected of robbing five banks in the San Diego area since the summer. According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, the most recent heist was at a <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> in La Jolla, where the suspect displayed a handgun, asked for cash, and fled on foot.</p>
<p>What remains to be explained is how anyone in his 70s can successfully flee on foot. Who was he outrunning?</p>
<p>Why they call it dope</p>
<p>Another enterprising crook in Brownsville, Texas, decided it was a good idea to sell pot door to door.</p>
<p>Inevitably, he knocked on the door of a police officer.</p>
<p>According to the New York Post, the cop asked the pot vendor to wait while he went inside. The "customer" returned with his badge and handcuffs.</p>
<p>An arrest very quickly followed.</p>

<p>Also running afoul of authority was the young football fan in Ohio who was kicked out of school for getting a haircut that expressed his allegiance to the Cincinnati Bengals football team.</p>
<p>The 'do features the NFL team's stripes and the letter B cut into the hair on the back of Dustin Reader's head. The eighth-grader said the haircut was his tribute to the team's success this season.</p>
<p>Officials at Dustin's school in Hamilton, Ohio, saw it differently. They say he was in violation of the school's code of conduct, which prohibits extreme and distracting hairstyles.</p>
<p>According to the Hamilton Journal-News, the kid's parents and his barber are mystified and not a little bit annoyed at the ruling. However, the schoolmasters vow Dustin will be kept away from other students until his renegade haircut grows out.</p>
<p>Food fight</p>
<p>On the subject of bengals--well, of tigers anyway--zookeepers in China claim some big cats in their care have grown so tame, they're afraid of the chickens they are supposed to be eating.</p>
<p>The Chongqing Wild Animal Park has five rare white tigers that had originally been trained to perform tricks for humans, reports the Chongqing Morning Post. The keepers have been encouraging the cats to follow more natural instincts by throwing them live chickens. Alas, the ploy hasn't worked.</p>
<p>The tigers won't go near the squawking birds. When one of the chickens passed out from fear, "The tigers did approach it," said feeder Shi Ruqiang, "but then it woke up again and squawked and they ran for their lives."</p>
<p>Shi says the keepers are now forcing the tigers to stay outside their cages for at least 12 hours a day to toughen them up. Moreover, they plan to introduce a wild tiger to the mix to show the big babies how to be predators.</p>
<p>Kitty cargo</p>
<p>Meanwhile a circus lion is recovering from a harrowing ordeal in Germany. The five-year-old cat, named Caesar, was in a van when it was stolen by an unwitting thief.</p>
<p>Actually, Caesar is in fighting form. More likely it was the thief who faced the harrowing ordeal.</p>
<p>The vehicle containing the ferocious lion was recovered a few hours later, after it crashed into a road sign, said police. Its engine was still running. The thief is still at large.</p>
<p>According to the <span class="companylink">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</span>, police and officials from Circus Probst speculate the thief became aware of Caesar's presence--a hungry roar, perhaps?--and that might have precipitated the crash.</p>
<p>Too tough</p>
<p>Also in fighting form are the soldiers in the Moldovan army. They don't bother with pesky flu vaccines that take weeks to develop and months to administer. They're fending off the H1N1 flu with onions and garlic.</p>
<p>The Moldovan Defence Ministry's chief doctor, Col. Sergiu Vasislita, says about an ounce of onions and a half-ounce of garlic will be added to each soldier's diet, reports the Scotsman.</p>
<p>Onions and garlic are highly regarded in the former Soviet republic as ways to boost the human immune system.</p>

<p>It wasn't so long ago that student nurses were a staple of bedside nursing in hospitals across Canada. Many nurses were trained at the fine hospital schools right here in Edmonton. Upon graduation, nurses were hitting the ground running, confident and sure of their clinical judgment and skills.</p>
<p>The shift from the hospital school to post-secondary education -- while undeniably improving the nursing profession and patient care outcomes, and promoting ever-expanding evidence-based practice - has left some students feeling a little overwhelmed when it comes time to actually set foot inside a hospital.</p>
<p>It is my opinion, shared by many of my classmates, that both staffing issues and expenditure concerns regarding the H1N1 influenza vaccine clinics could be addressed by reaching out to our local, underutilized, colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Student nurses here at Grant Mac-Ewan University, Norquest College, and at the University of Alberta would jump at the opportunity to practice our clinical skills and support our community. (And we'd do it all for free.)</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Scandals spur students to write integrity oath; Uof A business class also creates Business Ethics Awareness Day</b>
</div><div>Bill Mah   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>898 words</div><div>22 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>What do the Calgary Flames, Enron and child labour in the chocolate industry have in common?</p>
<p>They have all inspired a class of University of Alberta business students to write an oath of integrity.</p>
<p>And they want you to take it. "I guess the essence is they're frustrated with the lack of business ethics today at all levels," said Sharon Ryan, instructor of the university's ethical marketing class.</p>
<p>"This would be a way for business students, when they leave the school, to remind themselves of what integrity is. That act itself would be so powerful, perhaps they'd carry it with them into their careers."</p>
<p>The students were so moved by their studies of immoral missteps, white-collar crimes and abuse of power that they also created the university's first Business Ethics Awareness Day, which takes place Thursday.</p>
<p>That's the day the class will take the oath they created and encourage their fellow students to take it too; the first 100 will get a free Fair Trade chocolate cupcake in the business atrium on campus.</p>
<p>But they hope the oath becomes a grassroots movement, spreading beyond the classroom to the boardroom and out onto the streets to remind everyone to behave ethically.</p>
<p>Edmonton MP Laurie Hawn has taken it. So has St. Albert Mayor Nolan Crouse. A visiting French student has sent it back to France where more than 100 others have signed it.</p>
<p>Anyone can take the oath online at www.business.ualberta.ca/People/CurrentStudents/BusinessEthicsAwaren[http://www.business.ualberta.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/People/CurrentStudents/BusinessEthicsAwaren] essDay.aspx.</p>
<p>The website will track the numbers of oath-takers and where they are from.</p>
<p>"We just felt it was important that people have a conscious ethical code for people to operate in their professional careers," said Michael Holmes, a fourth-year business student.</p>
<p>"A lot of people function with their own ethical code but it's not really conscious or established. So we feel by creating this oath and having people understand what it's about, it would help them in making professional decisions."</p>
<p>People who take the oath promise to balance society's well-being, individual rights, and justice on the job.</p>
<p>They pledge to act with honesty, competence and respect.</p>
<p>Ryan, who also writes a business ethics column for the Edmonton Journal, suggested that her students create the oath after she learned many of them had never studied ethics and were incensed by recent business scandals.</p>
<p>A lesson on how children are forced to work on cocoa farms, for example left them in stunned silence.</p>
<p>"The straw that broke the camel's back with these students were the Calgary Flames (hockey players) getting their H1N1 shots. If highly educated government health officials can't even make the distinction between very obvious ethical lapses, we've got to do something about this," she said.</p>
<p>"So what we decided to do was to take this oath and not only make it available to business students but make it available to anybody in the workforce, anywhere in the world."</p>
<p>Other universities are also creating pledges of professional conduct to rehabilitate the tattered image of business leaders damaged by scandals and the avarice in the financial services sector which triggered the global economic downturn.</p>
<p>Last month, graduates from the Telfer School of Management at the University of Ottawa became the first MBAs in Canada to sign pledges to conduct their affairs ethically and work toward the well-being of all stakeholders--not just their shareholders.</p>
<p>They were following the lead of Harvard University's business school and the Thunderbird School of Global Management in Arizona, which marked MBA graduations with ethics oaths.</p>
<p>Ryan said those oaths are elitist and aimed at business executives making decisions on how goods move from suppliers to consumers.</p>
<p>"Ours is different. Our oath of integrity is a very simple one reminding people how important justice is and integrity in our everyday decisions.</p>
<p>"We'd be happy if a cab driver took it, or a janitor took it."</p>
<p>OATH OF INTEGRITY - I promise to act with the utmost integrity in balancing the ethics of societal well-being, individual rights, tenets of justice and principles of care in my efforts to manage the resources of the enterprises i endeavour to serve. - I understand that integrity is defined as the quality of being whole and undivided in my thoughts and in my actions. it requires that i act in a state of being consistently of sound moral principles such that:</p>
<p>I promise to act with honesty; i promise to be helpful to stakeholders when called upon. - I promise to act with competence throughout my career. - I promise to be fair to people and to treat them with respect. - I promise to uphold the principles of honour and promise-keeping. - I will foster an attitude of action orientation whenever possible. - I will strive to create sustainable organizational, environmental, social, and technological prosperity balancing both short-and long-term interests. - I make this oath freely and sincerely, and upon my honour.</p>

</p>
<p>History is full of blood feuds. Back in the Roman era, there were the Christians and the lions, which was admittedly one-sided. Ancient Greece featured some epic tussles between Sparta and Troy.</p>
<p>Others were more personal: Ali-Frazier, McEnroe-Bjorg, Lennon-McCartney, Lougheed-Trudeau, Oilers-Flames.</p>
<p>Really, if you think about it, 85 per cent of human history is probably just writers trying to keep track of who was trying to tear whose throat out.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the Calgary Stampeders and Saskatchewan Roughriders, the latest, greatest blood feud to emerge since Prime Minister Stephen Harper went mixed martial arts on Stephane Dion and his coalition of the willing right around this time last year.</p>
<p>While there is much to be said about the players and coaches, we'll leave that to the sports department. We're here to dive into the psyche of the third rail of sports blood feuds: the fans. After all, you can't have a blood feud without a few hard feelings between cities, can you?</p>
<p>While it took a while for Calgary to notice them--about 100 years, give or take the decade they had Lancaster and Reed in the house--the Saskatchewan Roughriders and their rabid followers, like the H1N1 virus, multibillion-dollar provincial deficits and 2012 (the movie, not the apocalypse), are here to stay awhile.</p>
<p>What's worse, they're impossible to miss.</p>
<p>Toting those hollowed-out watermelons around on their wheat-thinned domes is attention-getting enough, but what separates a Rider fan from just about every other these days is their sheer passion.</p>
<p>As much as we want the Stamps to spank the Riders when they travel to Mosaic Stadium in Regina today, and leave the melon-heads weeping in their rinds,</p>
<p>we must tip our cap to them at the same time.</p>
<p>For, truth be told, the CFL is that much</p>
<p>more fun when the Roughriders are in contention. There is nothing quite like Rider fans anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>Kelly Kirch, the program director at the FAN 960, grew up in Regina, a diehard Riders fan during the barren years (the '80s and early '90s). "It's a different feel, if you've ever been to Regina on a game day," he says. "It's a little crazy. My mom sells real estate in Regina and they don't even bother having an open house or showing people houses when the Riders are playing," he adds, "because either the people looking for houses don't want to do it, or the people selling houses certainly don't want to get out while the game is on."</p>
<p>The Roughriders are the only pro game in their town--and because Calgary has so many Saskatchewan expats living here, we've almost become, I hate to say it, Regina West.</p>
<p>While that could provide a few uncomfortable moments this afternoon, we are all about keeping the peace--we are Canada, after all --but I say, peace within limits. Those limits being that if you can't get a Rider fan to shut his yap, yell louder than they yell. Either that, or acknowledge Stamps fans' deepest, darkest secret: you've become the second-craziest CFL fans in your own city! Here, then, is a fan's guide to the West final:</p>
<p>Riders Fan Headquarters:Pazzer's Saskatchewan Pub, 5032 16th Ave (at Bowness). FAN 960 morning man Mike</p>
<p>Richards will be in the house. Stamps Fan Headquarters:</p>
<p>Pick your favourite local. We'll say Schanks North (103 Crowfoot Terrace NW) or Schanks South (9627 Macleod Trail South).</p>
<p>Riders Fan beverage of choice: the Grasshopper.</p>
<p>Stamps Fan beverage of choice: Big Rock Traditional.</p>
<p>Riders Fan Finger Food of Choice: Potash pancakes</p>
<p>smothered in Saskatoon berry syrup. Stamps</p>
<p>Fan Finger Food of</p>
<p>Choice: Hot wings.</p>
<p>Riders Fan Headgear of Choice:Hollowedout watermelon.</p>
<p>Stamps Fan Headgear of Choice: Smithbilt Hat.</p>
<p>Riders Fan Face Paint: Green. Stamps Fan Face Paint: Red.</p>
<p>Riders Fan's Best-Case Scenario:Six sacks of the traitor Henry Burris, who ditched the Riders to sign with the Stamps in 2005.</p>
<p>Stamps Fan's Best-Case Scenario:Stem the early Riders onslaught, keep the score close, steal it late on a field goal by Sandro, then prepare for the craziest week of your lives.</p>
<p>Riders Fan's Worst-Case Scenario: Quarterback Darian Durant wakes up today, realizes he's four quarters from playing in the Grey Cup, and throws a pair of Pick Sixes. Riders fans wake up Monday to six months of winter in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>Stamps Fan's Worst-Case Scenario:A slow start lets the Riders get their mojo working, making for a long day at Mosaic, followed by an even longer flight home, followed by seven days of the sports section dominated by stories about the Roughriders' quest to win the Grey Cup.</p>
<p>However, for anyone but Stamps and Riders fans, the result of today's game is a win-win scenario: either the hometown heroes are in, or downtown will be filled with thousands and thousands of Riders fans. Both promise to turn Stephen Avenue into a five-day-long party.</p>
<p>In fact, there's probably only one guy for whom no outcome really satisfies: the FAN'S Kirch. "I'm torn like an old sweater," he says. "Business wise, it would be cool to have the Stamps in, because we've (the FAN 960) got stuff down at the Telus Convention Centre, and we're going live for the players awards and we've got a Grey Cup party at Schanks --a thing at Rush, a thing at Cowboys--so we're busy, busy, busy, (and) it would good to have the Stampeders in there."</p>
<p>The problem is that--to paraphrase Woody Allen in a much different context --his heart wants what his heart wants.</p>
<p>"But the green in me still would like to see the Riders come in and use the Stampeders locker-room," he says. "I think that would be kind of funny."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Winnipeggers out of flu-shot line -</b>
</div><div>312 words</div><div>22 November 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>Winnipeggers weren't exactly lining up for the H1N1 flu vaccine Saturday.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority reported that just 837 people were vaccinated at the two clinics open on Saturday; one at the University of Manitoba, the other at the Holy Eucharist Parish Hall on Munroe Avenue.</p>
<p>That's compared with more than 2,400 who were vaccinated last Saturday at two open clinics -- again at the U of M, with the other at the Philippine Centre on Keewatin Street. About 10,000 people per day were immunized at a dozen city clinics open the last few weekdays -- the first days the flu shots were available to all Winnipeggers.</p>
<p>WRHA spokeswoman Heidi Graham said turnout on Saturday was low, noting some families may be waiting until the province receives a large shipment of adjuvanted doses early this week.</p>
<p>The province ran out of the adjuvanted vaccine last week, and was only offering the non-adjuvanted form on the weekend.</p>
<p>The non-adjuvanted vaccine is approved for pregnant women and for people between the ages of 10 and 65 who have a healthy immune system. But it isn't to be used for people over age 65, people with impaired immune systems or children under 10.</p>
<p>An adjuvant is a substance added to a vaccine to improve the immune response. A dose of vaccine with adjuvant uses one-quarter of the amount of antigen (the material that induces an immune response) used in a shot made without such a boosting additive.</p>
<p>The unadjuvanted vaccine is recommended for pregnant women since adjuvanted vaccine has not been tested in this group.</p>
<p>It has a similar formula to the seasonal flu vaccine, which has long been recommended for pregnant women.</p>
<p>To date, 170,115 people have been vaccinated in Winnipeg, Graham said.</p>

<p>Whether the Canucks really jumped the queue when they received H1N1 vaccinations is debatable. But it should be clear why they wanted to get the shots before the vaccine was made available to all British Columbians on Friday. The vaccine has had significant side effects including fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. It can take 48 hours for the side effects to clear, according to the World Health Organization. The Canucks got their shots last Sunday and Monday, providing enough time to flush any effects from the system before home games on Friday and Saturday.</p>

<p>Do you love badminton? Of course you do, you play it at the beach all the time. Well, how would you like to take on one of the best badminton players in the world? Today, between 1 and 2 p.m. at the Richmond Oval, North Vancouver's Anna Rice -- who represented Canada at the Beijing Olympics -- will happily take your money.</p>
<p>Here's the deal: Bring your racket. Pay Anna 10 bucks. If you beat her in the mini-game, you get your moolah back. If you don't win, the money goes to the honorable Right to Play sports organization.</p>
<p>"My parents and my sister are coming to take me on, but they're insisting that I give them a head-start of four points," Rice says. "The game is only to five." (She punctuates that comment with a happy-face icon.)</p>
<p>Big man with racket, think you can beat Anna Rice? Good luck with that.</p>
<p>n they have cauliflower ears too</p>
<p>In the age of H1N1, people are worried about shaking hands. But we've talked about how this hasn't stopped certain people in the sports world. Golfers shake their opponents' hands. So do cricketers.</p>
<p>Adds Province reader Simon Smoldon: "Rugby players are unique in that they beat the hell out of each other on the field, but after the game shake hands, hang out with each other, chat and make a point of sharing refreshments with each other at respective clubhouses. This provides opportunity for friendship -- and greater understanding."</p>
<p>Good news, Simon: Setanta has a new four-year deal to broadcast Guinness Premiership, Heineken Cup and Magners League.</p>
<p>n around the horn</p>
<p>If you're reading this, and you can't wait for the Olympics, you'll watch it in English. Maybe a bit in French too, you never know. But which other languages can you hear from Canadian broadcasters? In alphabetical order: Bangla, Cantonese, Cree, Dene, Gujarati, Hindi, Inuktitut, Italian, Mandarin, Mechif, Mi'Kmaq, Mohawk, Ojibway, Oji-Cree, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Tamil, Ukrainian and Urdu . . . CBC's Battle of the Blades will return for a second season next fall. Is former Oilers enforcer Dave Semenko available? Or the best schnoz in hockey, Tim Hunter? We certainly hope so.</p>

</div><div>AARON DERFEL    </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>420 words</div><div>21 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>With 1.7 million Quebecers immunized thus far against the pandemic H1N1 virus, health officials are emphasizing that the vaccine is very safe despite two dozen severe reactions to the flu shots in the province.</p>
<p>"There is no reason to be frightened about the vaccine," said Dr. Richard Lessard, director of Montreal's Public Health Department, in response to questions about the death of an elderly man following a flu shot.</p>
<p>An autopsy has yet to be completed, but the man suffered from a number of underlying health problems that undoubtedly accelerated his death, officials have said.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization estimates that more than 65 million people have been inoculated to date, and out of that total it suspects fewer than 10 cases of the paralyzing neurological disorder known as Guillain-BarrÈ Syndrome. "These numbers are in line with normal background rates of this illness," the WHO said in a statement.</p>
<p>In fact, people who are not vaccinated are perhaps at greater risk of developing GBS from an influenza infection. The WHO noted that no one with GBS has died since the mass vaccinations began.</p>
<p>Like Quebec, the WHO is investigating a "small number of deaths (that) have occurred in people who have been vaccinated."</p>
<p>China, for example, has so far administered more than 11 million doses and has been notified of two deaths following vaccination. The WHO is awaiting autopsy results to determine whether the individuals had suffered from underlying medical problems.</p>
<p>Worldwide, H1N1 has been blamed for the deaths of 6,770 people. In its latest update yesterday, the WHO noted that "in Canada, influenza transmission continues to intensify without a clear peak in activity."</p>
<p>The WHO has found that for Canadian children and teens, the H1N1 flu is the worst that has been seen in at least the past 12 influenza seasons.</p>
<p>In Quebec, the second wave of the pandemic continues to take its toll. In just the last seven days, the province has recorded 720 hospitalizations and 11 deaths. Local officials say that the second wave might be cresting but does not appear to be on the wane, as appears to be the case in the United States.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, WHO scientists have been begun studying samples of an apparently mutant H1N1 virus in Norway, raising concerns that the current vaccine might not be able to confer full immunity should a new, more virulent strain emerge.</p>

</div><div>JASON MAGDER   </div>
<div>THE GAZETTE</div>
<div>439 words</div><div>21 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Act now.</p>
<p>Vaccination sites on the island of Montreal are offering a "vaccination special" for children, but only for a limited time, says Montreal's Health and Social Services Agency.</p>
<p>"There will be express lines for parents who bring school-age children to vaccination centres," Deborah Bonney, a spokesperson for the city's health agency, said yesterday.</p>
<p>School boards urged parents to take advantage of those express lines and get their children inoculated against H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>They said it would be better for parents to accompany children over the weekend or after school, rather than rely on school boards for transportation.</p>
<p>Bonney said 75,000 of 204,000 people age 5 to 19 on the island have already been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Elementary and high school students will be bused to vaccination sites starting next week.</p>
<p>Lucie Lalande, the assistant director general of the Commission scolaire de MontrÈal, said her board would like to prioritize children whose parents aren't able to take them to vaccination sites.</p>
<p>She said organizing busing for the board's more than 100,000 students has been a "logistical challenge."</p>
<p>Letters were sent out to parents this week, and permission slips from parents are due in Monday and Tuesday before busing begins on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Lalande said the more parents take their children to vaccination sites, the more smoothly the busing will run.</p>
<p>"We think it is the responsibility of parents to get their children vaccinated, but we're here to support parents who can't take their children," she added.</p>
<p>Lalande added she didn't know how much it would cost to transport students or whether the board or the province would pick up the tab.</p>
<p>Lalande said her schools have reported a slightly higher than normal rate of absenteeism since the second wave of the flu began, but in recent days it seems to have stabilized.</p>
<p>English Montreal School Board spokesperson Michael Cohen said permission slips will be sent out to parents of elementary students on Monday and mailed out to parents of high school students.</p>
<p>Cohen said schools will transport students starting next week.</p>
<p>He added that his board is also asking parents to take their children themselves.</p>
<p>"We respect their choice, but one way or another, the message is: Get your children vaccinated," Cohen said.</p>

</div><div>955 words</div><div>21 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>W08</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>CORRECTION A Nov. 21 Your View letter that referred to the author of a Nov. 7 letter incorrectly identified the letter writer. The Nov. 7 letter was written by Claudio Antelmi, not Robert Anselmi. 20091127</p>
<p>As you may already know, the union representing only 280 members of DriveTest employees, United Steelworkers Union 9511, are on strike.</p>
<p>This needless strike has prevented 300,000 voting Ontarians the tax-payer right and privilege to take a driving road test to graduate to a higher level.</p>
<p>This privilege that we all have paid for may therefore be construed as a fundamental right. It is a right of passage for teenagers to secure their G2, and then their G driver's licence.</p>
<p>Many are depending on this graduation in order to begin jobs requiring driving, or because of the inherent need in this province to drive to work.</p>
<p>Classified drivers need their bus, truck, ambulance and driver's licence simply to pay their mortgage, and support their families.</p>
<p>This fundamental right is now being denied by the province. Driving schools are closing, and employees are being laid off, affecting thousands more. No one seems to be listening! The swine flu seems to be a "sexier" topic than hundreds of thousands of our populace trying to make ends meet! Shame on you, Toronto Star!</p>
<p>Jim Bradley, the Minister of Transportation, has washed his hands of the whole affair.</p>
<p>Premier Dalton McGuinty has let collective bargaining stall out, without an end in sight. He needs to grow a spine and enact legislation ordering the errant union back to work, or enact some tough measure like firing the lot of them.</p>
<p>Only 280 union members have held hostage the 55 test centres, and hundreds of thousands of us who need the testing centres to do what we've prepaid them to do: conduct a test.</p>
<p>Unless the workers' perceptions change, and their collective consciousness forms a basis in reality, there will continue to be an upset in our economy resulting in tough economic times.</p>
<p>As long as people submit to the unrealistic union demands of a very few, the province will face a huge risk to its safety: senior drivers who need retesting, drivers with medical conditions who need retesting, truck and bus drivers who need retesting, and expired licence drivers.</p>
<p>All of them are circling around you on our busy highways, and right now given leave to drive because of this madness.</p>

<p>It's too bad satirical letter</p>
<p>went over readers' heads</p>
<p>In defence of manual shifting</p>
<p>Your View, Nov. 14</p>
<p>The negative replies to Robert Anselmi's letter, which apparently slammed manual transmissions, made me wonder why so many readers didn't get what he was up to.</p>
<p>The Star, if it should ever choose to quote from Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal, had better prepare for the onslaught of outraged letters, since Swift's brilliant piece - with an apparent straight face - recommends that the Irish, as a way to solve their chronic famines long ago, cook and then sell their babies as fare for refined English palates.</p>
<p>Though Anselmi is not trying to be a second Swift, it's still sad to see the art of satire go up in flames.</p>

<p>More pricing rip-offs</p>
<p>at the gas pumps</p>
<p>Wide price gap for premium gas</p>
<p>Eric Lai, Nov. 14</p>
<p>The real rip-off here is the difference in the price gap at major retailers in Canada versus the U.S.</p>
<p>If you buy gas in Buffalo, the price gap at any of the major retailers is 27 cents (U.S.) per American gallon. Based on gasbuddy.com, that's about the U.S. average.</p>
<p>Up here, at Esso, Petro-Canada, Shell and <span class="companylink">Sunoco</span>, the price gap is 12 cents (Cdn.) per litre. If you do the math, the price gap in Canada is almost double.</p>
<p>Same companies, different gap. And the price is not artificially inflated?</p>
<p>Brian Laskin, Mississauga</p>
<p>I would like to know why every gas station in our town sells gas for exactly the same price.</p>
<p>When prices go up or down, they all do it in price unison. The so called "no-name" stations also charge the same.</p>
<p>If this isn't collusion, I don't know what is! I thought there was a law against this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Also, we seem to pay higher prices for gas in the Midland area than north of here, even though, on question, the excuse was transportation costs.</p>

<p>For far too long this automotive magician has used his active imagination (without widespread recognition) to create radical, well made, custom cars and hot rods that do Canada proud.</p>
<p>His creations have been exhibited in the U.S. at the Detroit Autorama, and The Hunnert Car Pile Up, among others.</p>
<p>In addition, Stony Smith is an inspiration to all backyard builders who toil away on hot rods and custom car projects unheralded with little or no recognition, but simply for the passion of making a unique automotive creation.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Care cuts run deep; Scaled-back services for the elderly are causing trouble for patients and their families, writes Pauline Tam.</b>

</p>
<p>(From The Ottawa Citizen, November 25, 2009) Jim Mimnagh was not suffering from dementia when he was admitted to hospital last month, nor does he have dementia now. Incorrect information appeared in an article on page C1 Saturday.***** </p>
<p>The problems at the eastern Ontario agency in charge of home care and nursing-home admissions have left Jim Mimnagh stranded in hospital and his family sick with worry.</p>
<p>Mimnagh, 83, was already suffering from dementia when he was admitted last month to The Ottawa Hospital's Civic campus, where he was diagnosed with an inflamed gall bladder.</p>
<p>Since being treated, he has been stranded in a hospital bed, waiting to hear when he would be discharged home, which is what Mimnagh and his family want. His doctor feels he needs to be in a nursing home.</p>
<p>Either way, Mimnagh is caught in limbo because of the turmoil at the Champlain Community Care Access Centre (CCAC). The agency has overspent its $180-million budget by $6.5 million barely halfway through its fiscal year, forcing it to scale back home-care services for the frail, sick and dying. As a result, would-be clients such as Mimnagh are being told to wait as an ever-growing list of more needy people are given priority access.</p>
<p>And because cuts to home care force more seniors into nursing homes earlier, Mimnagh and an estimated 3,700 frail elderly across the region face progressively longer waits to be admitted into long-term care facilities. Already, eastern Ontario seniors wait up to a year for one of the region's 7,440 nursing-home beds -- the longest delay in the province.</p>
<p>It's a no-win situation for Mimnagh and his family, who are scrambling to do whatever they can to get him home.</p>
<p>"Anyone who's in a hospital longer than they absolutely have to be risks picking up things like infections," said Mimnagh's daughter, Marina Cashman.</p>
<p>She has hired a physiotherapist to visit her bedridden father in an effort to prevent him from deteriorating physically, which makes the odds of discharge even worse.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cashman, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, is struggling to manage her own illness, while keeping her 83-year-old mother from being consumed by worry.</p>
<p>"I'm trying to do as much as I can, phoning anywhere I can think of to try and get him help. It's a nightmare," said Cashman.</p>
<p>The situation highlights the ripple effects that occur across the health-care system when the CCAC doesn't function properly.</p>
<p>In a sign of gridlock, The Ottawa Hospital has seen the number of its frail elderly patients climb steadily over the past three weeks, to 145 from 132.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 143 elective surgeries have been cancelled during the same period, largely because the beds set aside for surgical patients are instead being occupied by elderly patients who don't necessarily need hospital care, but have nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>Hospital spokeswoman Allison Neill said the backlog has put more pressure on the hospital in recent weeks than the flood of patients showing up with symptoms of the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The situation is likely to get worse with the abrupt departure earlier this week of the CCAC's chief executive, Sheila Bauer.</p>
<p>The leadership vacuum could create further problems for the 56,000 eastern Ontarians who, each year, rely on home care as a more humane, less costly alternative to crowded hospitals and nursing homes.</p>
<p>In an attempt to rein in spending, the CCAC has already stopped taking new clients and cut back in-home services such as nursing visits, personal support and physiotherapy. Meanwhile, dying patients desperate to leave hospital are being denied their wish to spend their final days in their own homes.</p>
<p>The cost-cutting has also affected personal support worker Peter Dunnigan, who, over the past month, has seen his 30-hour work week whittled down to 20 hours.</p>
<p>"Now I have to worry about whether I can afford to pay my rent and pay my bills," said Dunnigan, who works for one of the agencies contracted by the CCAC to provide home care.</p>
<p>Dunnigan is equally concerned about his nine clients, half of whom have been told they will no longer have home-care services by the end of the month.</p>
<p>In desperation, one woman, who lives on a disability pension, approached Dunnigan about whether she could pay him as an independent contractor to continue the home visits.</p>
<p>"She asked me, 'How much do you charge an hour so I can get you to come in two hours a month and help me with the laundry?' " said Dunnigan. "That's sad."</p>
<p>Dunnigan said most of his clients live alone and depend on him to bathe them, help them get out of bed or do light housekeeping. Some are so isolated that Dunnigan's visits give them peace of mind.</p>
<p>"We're the angels of the community, and what the CCAC has done is they have clipped our wings," said Dunnigan. "That has really hurt a lot of people in need."</p>
<p>Oris Retallack, executive director of the Council on Aging of Ottawa, worries about the impact of the cuts on the those who care for frail or elderly relatives, given that home care typically supplements the support provided by family and friends.</p>
<p>"There will be more families in crisis," said Retallack. "When you have adult children who are working and then you have a parent who gets into crisis, the children either can't work or the situation affects their productivity."</p>
<p>Carol Burrows, a former CCAC board member, is concerned that the cost-cutting would undo recent efforts to reduce hospital wait times and improve care for the elderly by expanding home-care services.</p>
<p>"We really have to maintain funding and support for community-based health-care services or we're never going to turn around the pressures on the hospitals," said Burrows, who's also an adviser to the Champlain Local Health Integration Network, eastern Ontario's health-planning agency.</p>

</p>
<p>Warning: this column will not end, if the world ends first.</p>
<p>We're doomed! Do-o-oooomed! Everywhere I turn I'm hearing about the End of the World - in films, books and TV shows. The apocalypse is coming soon, to a planet near you.</p>
<p>The latest panic has been caused by a supposed Mayan prophecy that the world will end on Dec. 21, 2012, at 11:11 a.m. - just in time to ruin our last Christmas shopping season. Apparently the ancient Mayans had a 5,000-year calendar that stops abruptly that day, so many people fear this must mean the End of Time for all time.</p>
<p>The Internet is filled with a gazillion sites predicting "The End." Recently, an intelligent architect asked if I would be stockpiling food in my basement for the Mayan catastrophe. No, I said, but I will be sacrificing a chicken on the barbecue to appease the ancient Stomach Gods.</p>
<p>There's much debate about just how the world will end. The blockbuster movie 2012 predicts we will die from earthquakes, volcanoes, tidal waves and other special effects. But other big apocalypse films offer different scenarios. In Daybreaker, a plague sweeps the planet in 2019; in The Road, the planet turns as cold, dark and lifeless as Sudbury.</p>
<p>Take your pick of countless other films, books and TV shows predicting doomsday by meteor showers, solar flares, tsunamis, gamma ray bursts, global warming, a new ice age and a head-on collision with a planet called Nibiru.</p>
<p>There's so much fear out there NASA recently had to calm Americans by announcing the world is not ending any time soon - despite news reports the new Large Hadron Collider could create a black hole that swallows Earth.</p>
<p>Why this obsession with Armageddon - what does it say about our times? Expert explanations range from recent jitters over the financial crisis to lingering 9/11 angst, environmental panic and generalized fear about swine flu, tainted meat, a nuclear Iran and Obama's Godless Medicare Plan.</p>
<p>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse have been replaced by 400.</p>
<p>With so many imminent threats to Earth, it's hard to concentrate on this column. What if I'm interrupted by an asteroid, or a tidal wave that literally kills my deadline? There are portents of The End everywhere, if you just pay attention. I've had some signs myself.</p>
<p>Last week I opened a box of eggs and four were rotten - what are the chances of that? This week the batteries in my flashlight, my phone and my watch all died mysteriously, along with my car battery. So did my toaster, which doesn't even have a battery. Coincidence?</p>
<p>Yesterday, I tried to sign in to my online bank account and my keyboard stuck on the letter F and typed it six times. FFFFFF. According to the Nostradamus Code, F is the sixth letter of the alphabet so it actually spells 666666 - the bank PIN code of The Beast.</p>
<p>I can see the appeal of the apocalypse. It makes me feel important to think the end of time may be coming in my own lifetime. I can tell my grandkids: "I was there when the world ended."</p>
<p>It also raises the stakes in our mundane daily lives. We live in a wimpy age when there's little left to fear except cellphone rays, second-hand smoke and possible flu shot side effects. We feel guilty for our comfortable lifestyle - it can't go on, can it? We deserve punishment.</p>
<p>We secretly crave some fear and chaos to give urgency and focus to our lives. That's why so many people want ... Apocalypse Now!</p>
<p>Maybe we should look at the bright side of Armaggedon. There may be some advantages to living in a post-apocalyptic world. For instance, there will be no rush hour traffic on the Décarie Expressway and it'll be easy to find parking spots downtown.</p>
<p>Real estate will be cheap, especially on the new Arctic Riviera. There will be no more annoying cellphones chirping in restaurants because there won't be any cellphones, or restaurants. There will be no need to change your snow tires because it will be winter all year round.</p>
<p>You won't even have to turn back the clocks anymore - because it will always be dark, apart from occasional solar flares. So embrace Armaggedon now - or at least plan ahead. Make a big bank loan with a payback date of Dec. 22, 2012.</p>
<p>My own prediction is that we will somehow make it past the Mayan 2012 crisis, the plague terror of 2019 and the media meteor shower of 2029.</p>
<p>My only real fear is November 2012 - when Sarah Palin runs for president.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'Flying squads' to make house calls; To inoculate elderly shut-ins. No one will be forgotten in all this, health and social services agency says</b>
</div><div>JASON MAGDER   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>680 words</div><div>21 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Travelling vaccination squads will visit seniors residences and make house calls in the coming days to elderly people who are confined to their homes.</p>
<p>However, the logistics of such an operation were still being worked out yesterday, the first full day all senior citizens on the island of Montreal were eligible to be vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Seniors who are mobile are asked to visit a vaccination centre near them. The list is located at www.pandemiequebec.gouv.qc.ca[http://www.pandemiequebec.gouv.qc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca], or by calling 514-644-4545. Those who can't leave their homes should call their local CLSC.</p>
<p>However, those who can't leave their homes will be visited by what the health ministry has dubbed a flying vaccination squad.</p>
<p>"No one will be forgotten in all of this," said Deborah Bonney, a spokesperson for Montreal's Health and Social Services Agency.</p>
<p>She said each CSSS, or community health organization, will have its own plan for seniors, which would include having health-care workers visiting people at home or arranging transportation to a vaccination centre.</p>
<p>Louis-Pascal Cyr, assistant to the executive director of the West Island's CSSS, said workers are in the process of ironing out details of the travelling vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>He said there are 1,500 to 2,000 people in seniors residences or living on their own in the region, and they will likely receive information next week about when they will be vaccinated: "For many of those who live on their own, we already give some type of services, so we know who those people are and we will be giving them a call. For people not on our list, who can't leave their homes, we encourage them to call their local CLSC." Cyr said workers are planning the timetable for the flying vaccination squads, so he didn't know when the process would begin.</p>
<p>However, he said travelling teams have already vaccinated about 500 people who are immunosuppressed, many of whom are living at home.</p>
<p>In his daily briefing, Alain Poirier, the director of public health for the province, said yesterday the province-wide vaccination campaign is ahead of schedule, and it's possible the general population will start being vaccinated as early as next weekend in some regions. "But it will depend on the regions, because right now, there are some regions that don't have any more vaccines available and are closed, and others that have too much," he added.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, 42 Quebecers have died of the H1N1 flu. There have been 1,854 people hospitalized, and 240 of those were treated in intensive care units. Poirier said 80 per cent of those hospitalized had chronic illnesses. About 1.7 million Quebecers have been vaccinated so far.</p>

</div><div>Steve MacNaull   </div>

<div>748 words</div><div>21 November 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>C12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>Hand in hand, my daughter and I started climbing and counting steps . . . 118, 119, and finally, 120.</p>
<p>We'd summited Coba, the tallest pyramid in Mexico's Riviera Maya.</p>
<p>While only 42 metres high, the climb is over uneven stone stairs hand-placed by Mayan labourers trying to get closer to the gods some 1,200 years ago.</p>
<p>A lot of adults in our tour group couldn't make the assent, so it was gratifying to reach the top and view the accomplishment through the eyes of my seven-year-old daughter Grace.</p>
<p>She was awed by our climbing prowess, the 360 degrees vista of surrounding jungle and the scariness of peering down the steep series of steps we would soon have to descend.</p>
<p>We found out we'd almost missed this thrill because the pyramid had just reopened early after a six-week closure for renovations.</p>
<p>Mexican officials are also toying with the idea of permanently closing Coba to clamouring tourists because it's such an important archeological site.</p>
<p>The pyramid was part of the Coba Mayan Village tour ($110 US) my wife, daughter and I did on a one-week holiday to the Riviera Maya - the Caribbean Sea stretch of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula bracketed by Cancun to the north and Tulum to the south.</p>
<p>The region is also the most accessible to Canadians, with Transat Holidays flying non-stop to Cancun from 18 Canadian cities, including Toronto and London.</p>
<p>Better yet, at about $900 per person (all taxes and fees included), a weeklong flight and all-inclusive package is about half-price from what it was last season.</p>
<p>Mexico's tourism industry has been hard hit by the recession, H1N1 flu and competition.</p>
<p>While that's a challenge for airlines, packagers, resorts and tour operators, it's great for bargain-seeking travellers.</p>
<p>And Mexico hasn't changed through it all.</p>
<p>It's still the sun-soaked escape from winter Canadians are looking for complete with luxurious all-inclusives, fascinating and fun excursions, friendly people, nachos and tequila.</p>
<p>After our pyramid antics, the Coba Mayan Village tour took us to an authentic Indian settlement.</p>
<p>In transition from ancient to modern culture, they live in thatched roof huts with TVs.</p>
<p>It's where Mayan matriarch Eleutheria taught us how to make the Mexican staple food tortillas.</p>
<p>Her nimble fingers scooped out ground corn soaked in water and lime and worked the glob into perfectly flat and round tortillas with a dizzying finger-press-and-palm-shaping motion.</p>
<p>We did our best to follow along with lumpy, irregular-shaped results that still tasted good after quick flips over the fire.</p>
<p>Then we were off for a swim in a cenote, which is the exposed section of an underground river.</p>
<p>Revealed after a hike, the cenote lay there in the twilight flat and so clean that you could see the bottom.</p>
<p>The Mayans believe cenotes have special cleansing and healing powers and are very proud of them.</p>
<p>Lucky for us they are willing to share them with tourists.</p>
<p>The cenote theme played out again at the end of our Rancho Bahia horseback riding tour ($68 US).</p>
<p>The dip in the fresh, clean and cool water was welcomed after trotting along jungle trails and climbing an observation tower.</p>
<p>More water play ensued at Xel-Ha (pronounced Shell-ha), which just happens to be the world's largest natural aquarium formed where the Caribbean meets inlets, underground rivers and cenotes.</p>
<p>General admission of $75 US gives you access to snorkelling, river rafting, hiking, caves, cliff jumping, rope swings and rope walks over water. Grace also opted for the $109 US extra of swimming with dolphins.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, the luxury resorts we stayed at – Grand Melia in Cancun and Gran Bahia Principe near Akumel – have spectacular white sand beaches and elaborate pool complexes.</p>
<p>As all-inclusives the package price not only includes hotel room, but all meals and drinks, kids' club and many activities.</p>
<p>The Riviera Maya of Mexico is famous for both its luxury all-inclusive resorts and its Caribbean Sea beaches. Above is the Gran Melia Resort in Cancun. Coba is the tallest pyramid in Mexico's Riviera Maya, a holiday area located on the eastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula.

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Parents of children who had an initial H1N1 flu shot may be relieved to learn their kids won't likely need a followup booster shot as previously recommended.</p>
<p>Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health has learned from the Ontario Health Ministry and the Public Health Agency of Canada that the second shot won't be required.</p>
<p>"They have indicated it's not necessary for healthy children," health board communications specialist Lucia Zdeb said Friday.</p>
<p>Healthy children are considered those aged three to nine who don't have chronic illnesses.</p>
<p>Zdeb said lots of kids got their first shot several weeks ago, back when they were informed they should return for a booster shot after at least 21 days.</p>
<p>Those families are now starting to come in to vaccine clinics for those followup ones.</p>
<p>But in the interval, health authorities have concluded that's no longer needed.</p>
<p>As for others, those within the ages of three and nine with chronic conditions still need two shots to maximize their immunity, she said.</p>
<p>The vaccine isn't recommended for newborns to babies six months old. But it is generally advised for people 10 years old and older.</p>
<p>More information, including revised clinic times for the coming week and beyond, is on the organization's website, www.wdghu.org[http://www.wdghu.org].</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, the health board had administered 16,700 inoculations, provided 3,160 doses to hospitals and 28,080 doses to 131 doctors in the community. It also delivered 4,370 doses to others.</p>
<p>The board had a supply of more than 26,000 doses available as of Tuesday.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Guelph flu assessment centre closing down Wednesday</b>
</div><div>Vik Kirsch   </div>
<div>Mercury Staff</div>
<div>401 words</div><div>21 November 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>The H1N1 assessment centre in Guelph is closing next Wednesday, following declining visits there related to the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Assessment centre executive director Ross Kirkconnell said in a release "whether or not the clinic stays closed remains to be seen."</p>
<p>It depends on how the flu plays out in the months ahead and whether another wave of H1N1 flu materializes.</p>
<p>In an interview Friday, Kirkconnell added that when the centre opened earlier this month at 65 Delhi St., it was seeing 45 people a day for assessments.</p>
<p>"We're now down to fewer than 20 a day." In the last two days, that's dropped to 15 daily.</p>
<p>The centre has seen between 300 and 400 people to date, "which is good because it's kept those people from waiting" in the emergency room and doctors' offices, Kirkconnell said.</p>
<p>The centre's clinicians don't inoculate visitors but assess their illnesses.</p>
<p>Visitors, depending on the severity of their illness, might be sent home to rest, be given prescriptions for medicines to help them recover, or in more serious cases be sent to hospital for further testing and treatment.</p>
<p>The centre - a joint Guelph General Hospital-Guelph Family Health Team initiative - opened Nov. 4 in large part because the hospital's emergency room was being swamped by visitors with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Hospital communications specialist Perry Hagerman said Friday volumes at the emergency department that were notably above normal in recent weeks have eased.</p>
<p>They were 20 per cent above normal in recent weeks, but dropped to seven per cent above this week.</p>
<p>"On Thursday, we saw 121." That's two below the average of 123 emergency department visitors on a typical given day before the flu season struck.</p>
<p>The assessment centre began operating at a time when the H1N1 vaccine was in short supply and health care officials were concentrating on groups at highest risk, such as those with underlying chronic medical conditions.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Second H1N1 death confirmed</b>

</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Public health confirmed Friday the region's second death attributed to H1N1.</p>
<p>The man was under 50 with underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>The case was under investigation when Region of Waterloo Public Health reported a week ago the area's first H1N1-related death of a man over 50.</p>
<p>That man also had chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>Associate medical officer of health Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang said the local death rate from the H1N1 flu virus fits with the provincial rate of three deaths per million.</p>
<p>"It's a rare event overall," Wang said.</p>
<p>The regular seasonal flu's mortality rate is 33 out of a million.</p>
<p>The difference is the seasonal flu primarily affects people over 65 who are at high risk for complications. H1N1, on the other hand, mostly affects children and young adults who are not prone to serious complications. The majority of H1N1 cases are mild.</p>
<p>Public health only reports deaths where the H1N1 flu virus is confirmed with a laboratory test, which is only done for those seriously ill or hospitalized.</p>
<p>"It's probably unlikely that we would miss a significant number of deaths," Wang said.</p>
<p>Although it seems H1N1 is less active in the community, the virus is still circulating and public health officials urge people to get vaccinated at a public clinic or by their family doctor.</p>
<p>There's been a surge in demand at community clinics since public health announced Wednesday that everyone in the region can get the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>"We've seen an increase in interest since we've opened it up to the general population," Wang said. "We're very pleased with the response."</p>
<p>At the clinic held Thursday in Cambridge, 1,742 people were immunized - the second highest number since the campaign started. The busiest clinic was the first, held Oct. 31 in Kitchener, that vaccinated 1,836.</p>
<p>Lines moved quickly at the last clinic despite the crowd with the continued use of the numbered wristband system, Wang said.</p>
<p>There are four more immunization clinics being held next week and another on the last Monday of November. Public health will monitor the demand before deciding if more clinics need to be held in December. Vaccine will still be available, perhaps through appointments, Wang said.</p>
<p>Vaccine is still being shipped to family doctors, with 80,000 doses sent out to date. Public health reported earlier in the week an estimated 93,000 people in the region have been immunized - about one in six.</p>
<p>Upcoming community clinic dates:</p>
<p>Nov. 23 – Waterloo Recreation Complex at 101 Father David Bauer Dr., Waterloo, from 2 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Nov. 24 – Victoria Hills Community Centre at 10 Chopin Dr., Kitchener, from 2 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Nov. 25 – Waterloo Collegiate Institute at 300 Hazel St., Waterloo, from 2 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Nov. 26 – Glenview Park Secondary School at 55 McKay St., Cambridge, from 2 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Nov. 30 – Kitchener Memorial Auditorium at 400 East Ave., Kitchener, from 2 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Clinic dates are available on the health unit's automated line at 519-883-2324. For general information about H1N1, call 519-883-2289 or go to www.waterlooregionpandemic.ca[http://www.waterlooregionpandemic.ca].</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Sponsorship scandal figure pleads guilty</p>
<p>Gilles-Andre Gosselin, a key player in the federal sponsorship scandal, pleaded guilty Friday to several fraud charges. Gosselin was immediately sentenced by an Ottawa judge to two years, plus a day. "I'm sorry and I apologize," he told Judge Lise Maisonneuve, breaking into tears. An executive with Ontario-based Gosselin Strategic Communications, Gosselin was charged last December with 19 counts of fraud for offences allegedly committed between 1997 and 2000. His name surfaced in a 2004-2005 inquiry into the sponsorship scandal, which revealed the public-relations executive billed the government for 3,673 hours of work in 1997.</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>No new leads on missing student</p>
<p>Police say they have no new leads after interviewing almost all of the students at the high school attended by a missing 18-year-old Toronto girl. All but four students at Forest Hill Collegiate had been interviewed by Friday afternoon as police investigate the disappearance of Mariam Maknihashvili. The girl was last seen Sept. 14 outside the school but most students have said they never spoke to her. The only solid clue so far in the case is Mariam's backpack, which was discovered with some school books in a parking lot on Oct. 8. Police have also been conducting a canvass of the area.</p>

<p>Yukon confirms secondH1N1 death</p>
<p>A Whitehorse woman has died of H1N1 flu, a territorial Department of Health and Social Services official confirmed Friday. The department is not releasing the woman's name and only said she was under 50 years old. She had no underlying health issues, said spokesperson Marcelle Dube. This is the second death in the Yukon associated with the H1N1 virus. The first victim was an elementary school-aged girl who had pneumonia.</p>

</p>
<p>I'm very concerned about our society right now. We have lost our way. We are no longer kind and courteous to one another.</p>
<p>We don't offer seats on buses or trains to those who look weaker and feebler than ourselves. We don't yield an inch to another driver for fear that letting someone ease into our lane will get us home a tenth of a second later. And after being rejected too many times, I hardly ever offer gum to total strangers anymore.</p>
<p>Our compassion for our fellow man is gone and a me-first attitude has replaced good old-fashioned fairness and politeness.</p>
<p>Even female soccer players are kicking each other in the face and yanking one another to the ground by the ponytail. I would expect that from the field hockey crowd, but I thought soccer players took the "no-hands" rule seriously.</p>
<p>I was in a grocery store recently and saw a guy I know - one of those guys you know you know but aren't really 100-per-cent confident about his name (shoot, is it Bruce or Steve? I can't chance it) so you say, "Hey, Hey, how's it going?"</p>
<p>So that's what I said and I tried to keep walking. Then he did something that shocked me. He stuck out his hand. I shook it and no doubt looked like a kid eating an asparagus.</p>
<p>My wife said later, "You didn't know what to do with that did you?"</p>
<p>I did not.</p>
<p>I would not know what to do under normal circumstances, but with H1N1 hysteria, this guy's handshake traumatized me. And I had just finished applying hand sanitizer. I was feeling clean and healthy. Now I was surely on my last legs.</p>
<p>Handshakes are still OK in the context of a job interview or a formal introduction, or even a celebrity run-in. I mean, yes, I'm sure if I ever ran into a super huge celebrity like George Clooney, Beyoncé or Kermit the Frog I would try to shake hands.</p>
<p>But when you bump into someone you barely know and he ambushes you with a "Put 'er there, pal" gesture, well, what do you do with that?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you just have to shake hands or risk being labelled a "snubber" - which, I guess, is way worse than being labelled a handshaker in a time of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>It's just another one of our backward social conventions. You don't shake hands and you're the bad guy when, clearly, the person initiating the unnecessary handshake is the bad guy. He's the guy spreading a pandemic, but if I take a stand and stop him, I'm acting like a snob and a jerk.</p>
<p>I ran into another issue at the grocery checkout (after spreading handshake guy's germs all around the store). I never really got why it is that when there's a big line at one checkout and a cashier comes along and opens another checkout, she says, "I can help someone over here" and the first person to move is the person who was at the end of the line.</p>
<p>And the rest of us schmucks let it happen. No one ever says, "Hey buddy, you can't just make the jump from last to first!"</p>
<p>To say something would just be rude. The rule, flawed though it is, is that when a new checkout opens it's a free for all.</p>
<p>Our only hope for stopping this stuff might be to bring in some lineup security. And I know some female soccer players who would be good for the job.</p>

<p>In public health circles, they're known as black swans.</p>
<p>They are fundamentally the same species as the influenzas or respiratory ailments we see all the time.</p>
<p>But like H1N1 or SARS, they're different enough in their genetic plumage to warrant very close scrutiny.</p>
<p>The thing is, you just can't know how black swans are going to behave until you watch them for a while, says Dr. Donald Low, medical director of Ontario's public health laboratories and chief microbiologist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>And what's observed during that watching process is news, pure and simple, he adds.</p>
<p>"I haven't thought all along that the media has overreacted," Low says of the extensive and often-fraught coverage swine flu has received across Canada.</p>
<p>"We have to recognize that this event is news."</p>
<p>One of the widely hailed "heroes" of Toronto's SARS battle six years ago, Low says he learned the value then of keeping a pipeline open to the media as an epidemic unfolds.</p>
<p>So as the century's first pandemic reared up in April, and then made its fall return, Canada's public health apparatus was poised and pleased to speak to the media often and at length as the disease caught hold.</p>
<p>"I don't see how anybody could not consider that newsworthy," says Low, "and that the public would not be very interested, with the history we have of pandemics, of being informed about this."</p>
<p>That H1N1 turned out to be a mild flu was almost beside the point, he adds: The risk of under-reporting it, and having a more lethal ailment sweep though an unprepared population, was more dangerous than spreading some ultimately unwarranted fear.</p>
<p>"There is so much that we didn't understand and don't understand about influenza," Low says.</p>
<p>"We couldn't say that, 'Oh no, we're just going to stop reporting on this, that it's not important any longer, and just go about your daily business.'"</p>
<p>Morbidity and mortality rates, economic impacts - those remained "unknowns" throughout much of the summer and early fall, Low says.</p>
<p>As the disease revealed itself, however, urgent pleas to get vaccinated, wash hands or stay home were accompanied by caveats that this dark swan was a relatively benign bird.</p>
<p>Yet fear will inevitably spread during any public health crisis, Low says.</p>
<p>An innate propensity to panic among segments of the public and nuance-free coverage by some media outlets will always mean a dose of distress will accompany any emerging ailment.</p>
<p>"This happened for every event, I don't care what kind of event it is," he says. "There's a gradation of the quality of reporting depending on the agency, (or) the journalist.</p>
<p>"That's life, that is going to continue whether it's H1N1 or whether it's a terrorist attack, or whatever. That's because it's news."</p>
<p>Still, Low says, some major public health messages could have been cast less alarmingly.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization's spring declaration that H1N1 had achieved pandemic status, for example, may have been overwrought, he says.</p>
<p>"When they did that there was a tone that this was going to really cause a lot of death and destruction.</p>
<p>"Maybe that was overstated."</p>
<p>Yet such international and domestic declarations are also required to set official response wheels in motion.</p>
<p>"They facilitate measures which couldn't be done if that declaration wasn't made," Low says.</p>
<p>"It wasn't a statement to hunker down and go to your basements. This is being stated so we can facilitate the distribution of vaccine and so on and so forth."</p>
<p>Low says the same progression of public health and media reactions have accompanied a string of scares, from flesh-eating disease in the 1980s to avian flu last decade to SARS and H1N1 this century.</p>
<p>What's more, he says, that same "helter-skelter" progression is likely to repeat itself as new ailments emerge in the future.</p>
<p>"The next new emerging disease, we'll start at ground zero. We'll go through the same problems that we've had and the issues and the controversy about how it was reported and how public health responded.</p>
<p>"That happened with every new black swan event that comes along."</p>
<p>In the end, the media itself will decide when the H1N1 story is over, Low says.</p>
<p>"I'm telling you, when the media senses the public has had enough, this will be dropped like a hot potato."</p>

</div><div>Christopher Reynolds   </div>
<div>Los Angeles Times</div>
<div>711 words</div><div>21 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>G6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Mexico's drug war is entering its fourth year. Its H1N1 flu outbreak began with dozens of deaths and global headlines last spring. This leaves travellers with at least two reasons to study up before booking that Mexico trip.</p>
<p>But it doesn't necessarily mean staying home.</p>
<p>Mexico's drug-war death toll reached more than 9,900 between January 2007 and early October 2009, by the count of the University of San Diego's Trans-Border Institute. Many of the deaths have occurred near the U.S. border and far from the resorts and cities that draw thousands of North Americans every year.</p>
<p>Robert Reid, who has contributed to Lonely Planet's Mexico volumes and serves as the New York-based U.S. travel editor for the guidebook publisher, likes to remind people that Mexico is about the size of France, Spain, Germany and Italy -- combined.</p>
<p>"Before you let trouble in one corner of the country affect your travel to another corner, he said, "Imagine a shootout in Sicily forcing a cancelled vacation in Germany."</p>
<p>Also, as Mexican officials are quick to note, most drug-war victims have been active partisans -- that is, drug-traffickers or law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>Charles Pope, interim director of the Trans-Border Institute, visits Tijuana and Mexicali up to four times a month, travelling just as he did in the years before President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug-traffickers in 2006.</p>
<p>Pope dines out, drives at night and said he wouldn't hesitate to go to a baseball game, a "lucha libre" (professional wrestling match) or an event at the Tijuana Cultural Center.</p>
<p>Still, there has been plenty of trouble in Mexico, and it continues. On Oct. 16, authorities said they found nine mutilated bodies in Tlapehuala, a town in the state of Guerrero, and three more bodies in Acapulco, each accompanied by a threatening note signed, "The boss of bosses."</p>
<p>Mexican authorities say that in the first half of 2009, more than 1,000 killings took place in Ciudad Juarez, located across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas.</p>
<p>Although Canadian and U.S. citizens have been killed in Mexico, those deaths make up a small fraction of those who have died in the drug-related violence.</p>
<p>If you set flu aside, said Edward Hasbrouck, author of The Practical Nomad: How to Travel Around the World, the biggest danger for a law-abiding traveller in Mexico is probably "the same as the big danger in the U.S. -- road crashes. Almost everything else is negligible by comparison."</p>
<p>But Hasbrouck said, "You have to evaluate not only 'is it safe?' but also, 'Will I be so frightened that I won't enjoy my trip?'"</p>
<p>On its website www.voyage.gc.ca[http://www.voyage.gc.ca], Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada states, "Canadians should be particularly vigilant in northern Mexico and all cities bordering the United States, particularly when travelling to the cities of Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez, as firefights between the military and drug cartels can occur without warning at any time. Travellers should monitor local news before travelling to areas affected by turf wars."</p>
<p>Check the website before travelling, for updates. Travellers can also register on the website so they can be easily contacted and helped in an emergency.</p>
<p>On the swine flu front, Mexico drew worldwide attention in April and May when H1N1 was blamed for dozens of deaths. In the offices of Passport Health Los Angeles, a travel medicine and immunization clinic, executive director Rayann Aziz recalls the concern that erupted then. But lately, the U.S. and Mexico are in the same position -- jointly leading the world in cases.</p>
<p>Aziz's advice for anybody travelling to Mexico is identical to her advice for those staying home: Get a 2009 H1N1 vaccination, especially if you're in a high-priority group (pregnant women; people who live with or care for children up to six months old; health care and emergency medical services workers; those six months to 24 years old, and anyone 25 to 64 with a chronic health disorder or compromised immune system).</p>

<p>Another case of the east ripping off the west. We always seem to see them, but they never seem to see us. I want games in the evening, not in the afternoon.

<div id="hd"><b>Can Vancouver's cruise industry turn the tide?; Our loss is Seattle's gain. There are several reasons for this -- and ways B.C. tourism can make a comeback</b>
</div><div>Warren Gill and John M. Munro   </div>
<div>Special to the Sun</div>

</p>
<p>What's happened to Vancouver's cruise business and, more important, what's going to happen in the future? Studies of the direct economic impact of the cruise business on the British Columbia economy suggest that changes in the cruise industry will have lowered B.C.'s annual GDP by $300 million by 2010. This is because ports that serve as home ports for cruise ships enjoy three types of economic benefit.</p>
<p>First, passengers often combine a cruise with vacation time in the port where they board or disembark from the cruise ship, leading to substantial spending across the various sectors of the local tourism industry.</p>
<p>Second, crew members will often spend in home ports. The most important economic effect is the spending by cruise lines in provisioning and servicing their ships as they finish one cruise and begin another.</p>
<p>In 2002 1,125,000 passengers boarded and disembarked from cruise ships in the Port of Vancouver. By 2008 Vancouver passengers had decreased by 270,000, a decline of almost one-quarter. There was a slight rebound in 2009 due mainly to cruise ships diverted from Mexico because of the swine flu, but the downward trend is well established.</p>
<p>Next year there will be an acceleration in this negative trend as most cruise lines are reducing the number of ships they are operating on Alaska cruises and almost all this decrease is happening in Vancouver. Our rival home port, Seattle, can expect some decreases because of cruise-line rescheduling, but 85 per cent of the reductions will fall on Vancouver.</p>
<p>Next year's rescheduling reflects a cruise lines' expectation that the Alaska cruise will be less popular. In the five years from 1994 to 1999 traffic grew by an average of 12 per cent a year, adding 350,000 passengers over the period, and in the five years from 1999 to 2004 it also grew by the same annual average percentage, adding more than 500,000 passengers on the larger base. After 2004 average annual growth was slower -- about four per cent -- and since 2007 there has been little if any growth.</p>
<p>Alaska's 2007 imposition of a head tax on cruise passengers has been a factor in the market's stagnation; the worldwide North American cruise industry cruise business has continued to grow at seven per cent annually.</p>
<p>Worse, from Vancouver's point of view, about one-half of Alaska cruise passengers are now carried from and to Seattle. All of Seattle's growth has been since 1999, the last year that Vancouver enjoyed an unchallenged monopoly of this business. Since Alaska cruises travel to ports in a U.S. state and carry mainly U.S. residents, why did Vancouver monopolize home-port business for so long?</p>
<p>Vancouver's home-port monopoly was based on three factors.</p>
<p>First, only ships registered in the U.S can transport passengers between U.S. ports without visiting a foreign port en route. And only ships built in the U.S and staffed with a U.S. crew can operate as U.S-registered ships. Because most cruise ships are built in Europe and have international crews, they cannot transport passengers between U.S. ports without a stop in a foreign port, and Vancouver used to be that foreign port, making us the default home port for the Alaska cruise.</p>
<p>Second, Vancouver was just the right distance from the Alaska panhandle for one-week round trips; Seattle's two-way extra 300 miles was seen to be a critical disadvantage.</p>
<p>Third, Vancouver's cruise-ship port facilities were far superior to what Seattle used to have.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s the Alaska cruise market was growing more quickly than Vancouver's weekend terminal capacity. Vancouver even developed a weekday departure market -- rare in the cruise industry -- because the desirable weekend berths were full. In 2000, Norwegian Cruise Line experimentally placed a faster ship in Seattle so as to obtain a weekend departure. This faster ship, together with a new route outside Vancouver Island, enabled them to overcome Seattle's distance penalty and still visit the requisite "three ports and a glacier" that constitutes a basic Alaska cruise.</p>
<p>The main interest of U.S. passengers is Alaska -- the Last Frontier -- and Beautiful B.C. is just an impediment to getting there. But to have a Seattle-to-Seattle round trip the cruise lines needed a Canadian convenience port and the Port of Victoria gladly filled this role, although the first ship (like most today) stayed for only a few hours in the evening, when many passengers remain on the ship. On average each passenger routed through Vancouver spends locally more than eight times as much as a Victoria passenger. Cruise lines, whose total Vancouver spending amounts to about as much as total passenger spending, spend almost nothing in Victoria. B.C. has lost hundreds of millions in economic activity.</p>
<p>B.C.'s loss was Washington's gain. The terrorist attacks on the United States in September 2001 helped Seattle. Even though the attacks took place in the U.S., they had the effect of making some Americans leery of flying and, ironically, of foreign travel. As border crossing became more difficult, avoiding a cruise that started in foreign Vancouver was more and more attractive. The border formalities associated with a short stop in Victoria are comparatively trivial.</p>
<p>Seattle has enjoyed two other advantages over Vancouver. First, while the prices charged by the cruise companies are fairly similar for Vancouver and Seattle cruises, there is evidence of a Vancouver "surcharge" of 10 per cent. Second, the cost of a cruise to a tourist also includes the airfare to and from the cruise. Airfares to Seattle from U.S. cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles and Denver are about half as much as to Vancouver.</p>
<p>Vancouver could have countered these important handicaps by doing something to promote the scenery of the B.C. Inside Passage, which is only available for Vancouver-based cruise ships. With the rise of Seattle and increasing size of cruise ships, cruise lines have abandoned the beautiful protected waterways along B.C.'s mainland coast and now use the often stormy open seas of Hecate Strait on their way to and from Alaska, just as they do for Seattle-based cruises.</p>
<p>Can Vancouver regain lost business?</p>
<p>Since our cruise home-port monopoly was partly the result of a protected market, gaining this trade back in a competitive market where we are clearly uncompetitive will be a challenge. The airfare handicap could be addressed by truly open-skies air transport policies. Some of the trade could be regained by a concerted effort by tourism agencies to work with the cruise lines to promote the Vancouver and B.C. aspects of the cruise to U.S. passengers. Much of the Alaska cruise experience is oriented to beautiful scenery. B.C. should work to market B.C.'s Inside Passage in the way that Alaskan scenery, such as Glacier Bay has been used.</p>
<p>Could more revenue be gained from the Victoria stopovers? Yes, if the cruise lines could be encouraged to stay longer and at better hours. This might be done through price incentives where longer stays were cheaper than shorter ones. This would not compensate for the loss of the home-port function in Vancouver, but it would produce some additional returns.</p>
<p>Without a coordinated public policy response it seems unlikely that there will be an improvement, and it will be left to individual ports to fight for business without any apparent understanding of the overall impact on the B.C. economy.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Soaring health care costs need to be curbed</b>

</p>
<p>As health care costs continue to reach amazing new heights, Canadian politicians are trying hard to look the other way.</p>
<p>Debate during Parliament's fall session has focused on the roll out of stimulus spending, H1N1, crime, the long gun registry; all manner of things -- except health costs. This, despite the fact:</p>
<p>- Governments spent $172 billion in 2008 on health care, nearly 60 per cent more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>Only half that increase is attributable to combined affects of population growth, inflation and aging.</p>
<p>- Drug spending increased by 136 per cent during the decade.</p>
<p>- In B.C. this year, health care will account for 47.5 per cent of government expenditures; and 43 per cent in Ontario.</p>
<p>With governments increasingly confronting jumbo deficits, it's hard to see how the issue can be backburnered much longer.</p>
<p>As the Canadian Institute for Health Information observed in its latest annual report: "If there is a unifying theme to the past decade in Canadian health care it is abundance.</p>
<p>"Spending rose substantially compared to the previous decade's restraint."</p>
<p>Even with the spending, the institute concludes: "we do not have enough comprehensive information to link, with any precision, health care spending to health outcomes."</p>
<p>In the November issue of the Literary Review of Canada, physician and health consultant Charles J. Wright argues, Canadians are overdosing on Medicare, consuming more health services and pharmaceuticals than is in fact good for them.</p>
<p>He says Medicare has gone way beyond its original mandate, which was to provide "necessary medical services," provided by physicians and hospitals.</p>
<p>And in years to come spending could well increase because governments have lately invested in training more health care professionals. In the last 10 years, for example, the entering class of medical students has increased by 68 per cent; nursing students by 51 per cent.</p>
<p>Wright warns that Canada's "continuous limitless growth of health services cannot possibly be sustained.</p>
<p>"All but the most mathematically challenged supporters of universal health care recognize that there is a limit and that we have reached it."</p>
<p>The public has been hearing this sort of message for years and the spending has continued. Health care costs have gone from consuming seven per cent of GDP in 1975 to 9.8 per cent in 2005 and this year spending is expected to reach 10.7 per cent of GDP.</p>
<p>Studies launched under Prime Minister Jean Chretien included the 2001 Romanow Commission, the 1999 Kirby Commission and the 1994 National Forum on Health. All failed to provide the impetus to curb costs.</p>
<p>"The serious need for change," asserts Wright, "seems to face an even more serious lack of political enthusiasm."</p>
<p>Politicians, knowing voters are sensitive about access to health services, haven't wanted to touch the file with a bargepole.</p>
<p>Wright argues bigger health budgets aren't necessarily translating into better outcomes; that in some cases, therapeutic testing and prescription drugs are doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>The Canadian Institute for Health Information notes that governments will be better able to judge the efficacy of all the spending once health records are computerized. Ottawa's last budget earmarked $500 million for work on electronic health records. Ballooning health budgets, of course, aren't an exclusively Canadian problem.</p>
<p>When it comes to spending as a percentage of GDP Canada ranks seventh among 30 industrialized nations, with the U.S. at the top, with 17.6 per cent of GDP going towards health care in 2009. If misery loves company, there's plenty of it to go around.</p>

<p>Has no one else connected the H1N1 confusion and fiasco with the departure of three top public health doctors in 2008. (Former MDs worked cheap; Public health docs, fired for salary demands, paid below scale," The Journal, July 29 2008.)</p>
<p>At the time Ron Liepert chose not to renew their contracts because they disagreed with him on the syphilis crisis facing Albertans. Even though they (the specialists) were modestly paid by Canadian standards, he claimed they were too expensive and said the province couldn't afford them. The public health doctors wanted a public awareness program on the sharp rise of syphilis and the risk factors etc. and he didn't. If I can recall, four infants died. They actually all left their jobs in protest, a major vote of non-confidence of the Minister of Health from the medical community!</p>
<p>He obviously didn't consult experts on the way to go about the vaccination program. We just can't afford to have someone with so much ego and bloody-mindedness making decisions at this level.</p>
<p>He must be fired, if not for the H1N1 fiasco then finally for the firing of all our top public health doctors and leaving the whole province vulnerable.</p>

</p>
<p>In all the furor over the availability of H1N1 shots, folks seem to be unaware of the creeping, two-tier medicine involving seasonal flu shots.</p>
<p>Until this year, my wife and I, both over 65, got our seasonal shots for free at a public clinic. This year, we decided to get them again. But now they're only available at public clinics when you also get an H1N1 shot. Since seniors have the lowest risk of getting H1N1 it was unknown when we could get the seasonal shots.</p>
<p>We seniors have a high risk of developing complications from seasonal flu. So it seemed prudent that my wife and I get the shots even if we had to pay for them. Accordingly, we got them at a <span class="companylink">Safeway</span> pharmacy for $18 each. The pharmacist said they charge because they have to buy their vaccine.</p>
<p>I later learned we could have got them at <span class="companylink">Costco</span> for $12 each. Their pharmacist didn't know if they cover their cost at$12. But it's likely the reason they charge so much less than <span class="companylink">Safeway</span> is that they like to out-price competitors, he said. Both places give the shots by appointment, unlike the first-come, first-served system at the public clinics.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Why didn't province use emergency plan?</b>
</div><div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>457 words</div><div>21 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>O ne year ago, the Alberta Emergency Management Agency offered its expertise at a seminar in Victoria, B.C. Under the heading "Alberta--A Province Prepared," it outlined an impressive co-operative plan between municipalities, industry and other partners to deal with emergency events. Established following the events of Sept. 11, 2001 and honed with the planning for the H5N1 virus in 2005, the Alberta model is regarded as one of the best civic response systems in North America.</p>
<p>So where, Albertans should ask, was all this expertise during the province's botched rollout of the H1N1 vaccine? Calgary's emergency response team was largely ignored by Alberta's health superboard, which apparently felt it could do it all on its own, thank you very much. The Calgary Emergency Management Agency (CEMA) was ready to jump into action, as it has numerous times for the Y2K security threat, the Hub Oil explosion, the G8 summit, the Stanley Cup Playoffs and WorldSkills. But the call from the province and the health board was delayed.</p>
<p>In the province's attempt to co-ordinate supply at four distribution points, pregnant women lined up shivering outside with small kids in tow and seniors had to climb stairs at the Olympic Oval. Fire halls sat empty. The Stampede was left twiddling its thumbs. When the call finally arrived for a sixth Calgary clinic, the Stampede and CEMA sprang into action in 30 minutes, giving Calgarians their best vaccination site -- the inside warmth of the Stampede grandstand, with C-Train access, lots of parking and even hot chocolate.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert, when he met with the Herald's editorial board Oct. 30, said it is difficult to find space in Calgary for vaccination sites. Meanwhile, the Stampede grandstand was sitting there, empty, along with who-knows-how many sites that CEMA could have coughed up.</p>
<p>With the H1N1 eligibility list being expanded to virtually everyone by early next week and more vaccination sites being added, we can only hope that future rollout goes more smoothly.</p>
<p>There will be more emergencies and clearly there are lessons to be learned. Which is why it is important for Fred Dunn, the auditor general, to review the province's pandemic plan, its implementation and its cost. CEMA has valuable expertise. If the staff at Alberta Health Services were control freaks and ignored them, it is hoped Dunn will say so. If tight control of supply and distribution was necessary, fine.</p>
<p>But it's clear that the Stampede grandstand was there all along. The province and the superboard didn't use it for nearly two weeks, while people climbed stairs and shivered in the cold.</p>

<p>How long do flu germs live outside the body?</p>
<p>S.I.</p>
<p>According to <span class="companylink">Mayo Clinic</span>, the length of time that cold or flu germs can survive outside the body on a hard surface, such as a doorknob, varies greatly. But the suspected range is from a few seconds to 48 hours -- depending on the specific virus and the type of surface.</p>
<p>Flu viruses tend to live longer on surfaces than cold viruses do. Also, it's generally believed that cold and flu viruses live longer on non-porous surfaces -- such as plastic, metal or wood -- than they do on porous surfaces -- such as fabrics, skin or paper.</p>
<p>Although cold and flu viruses primarily spread from person-to-person contact, you can also become infected from contact with contaminated surfaces. The best way to avoid becoming infected with a cold or flu is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or with an alcohol-based sanitizer.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website says the H1N1 virus can survive and infect a person for two to eight hours after being left on a surface.</p>
<p>What is the best way to clean piano keys?</p>
<p>D.A.</p>
<p>For general cleaning on plastic or ivory keys, use vinegar and water on a soft cloth. For ivory keys, wipe with non-gel, non-bleach toothpaste on a damp cloth. Ensure that you rub gently and do not scrub. Rinse with fresh milk and buff well. Note: Over time and with repeated cleaning, the yellow on your ivory keys can be significantly reduced. Whitening your ivory piano keys takes a long time and a great deal of patience.</p>
<p>Extra tidbit: If you are unsure whether your piano keys are plastic or ivory, note that piano keys that have ivory tops are made in two parts. If you look carefully you will see where they join. Also, ivory piano keys are off-white instead of stark white. Lastly, ivory has a grain. Modern pianos have plastic keys that do not have any grain. Be careful not to mistake ivory keys with cellulose keys -- cellulose also has a grain, but the cellulose grain is more even than ivory.</p>

<p>Amid all the reported confusion and complaints about the H1N1 vaccination centres in Quebec, we found none of this last week when we arrived at the Vaudreuil-Dorion centre on Harwood Blvd. We received our appointment coupon within five minutes and when we reported back at our designated time, the whole experience took about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Hand sanitizer is flying off shelves and people are forgoing large crowds to avoid catching swine flu, but, for many, basic hygiene seems to take a vacation when on holiday.</p>
<p>Take, for example, Ireland's Blarney Stone. Why would anyone in their right mind kiss the same stone surface that the lips of almost half a million people have touched that year alone? Maybe it's the Guinness.</p>
<p>According to a poll of more than 4,600 travellers on tripadvisor.com, however, 34 per cent of travellers say that since the H1N1 outbreak, they're being more "germaphobic" by washing and disinfecting their hands more frequently when travelling. Here are the top five germiest attractions in the world according to TripAdvisor's editors and readers:</p>
<p>1. Kiss me, I'm filthy: Blarney Stone, Ireland</p>
<p>Legend says that those who kiss the Blarney Stone, a block of stone built into Ireland's Blarney Castle, are rewarded with eloquent speech. But given that up to 400,000 mouths from all over the world touch the stone each year, putting your own to the grimy attraction -- no easy task in itself -- may be too high a price for the promised "gift of gab." One TripAdvisor traveller commented, You "have to bend over backwards, and kiss the stone upside down -- imagine the germs on the stone from everyone doing that!"</p>
<p>2. Sticky situation: Wall of Gum, Seattle</p>
<p>A bizarre tradition at Seattle's Market Theatre in Post Alley has turned into a fascinating yet very germy attraction: a giant wall of gum. In the 1990s, visitors began sticking their gum to the wall while waiting in line, resulting in a colourful and somewhat stomach-turning sight after more than a decade of gum gathering. Some intrepid visitors have even moulded shapes and faces out of their masticated gum.</p>
<p>3. Lip reading: Oscar Wilde's Tomb, Paris</p>
<p>It is a testament to the love and respect felt by booklovers and admirers the world over: Oscar Wilde's tomb in Paris's Père Lachaise cemetery is famously covered in lipstick prints. But with a rainbow of hundreds of visible kiss marks adorning the grave, and countless more planted every year, one can't help but wonder ... isn't there a cleaner way to show your literary appreciation?</p>
<p>4. Foul fowl: St. Mark's Square, Venice</p>
<p>A place of immeasurable beauty, Venice's famed St. Mark's Square has a dirty side: its thousands of hungry pigeons. While vendors no longer sell food to tourists to give to the birds, they still flock in countless numbers, with many visitors choosing to touch and even hold the pigeons. Be careful -- these dirty fowl have been known to leave foul unexpected gifts on tourists. One TripAdvisor traveller wrote: "I know it does seem a little bit disgusting, but it's so totally hilarious to see your friend/partner/dad being attacked by birds!"</p>
<p>5. Grubby mitts: Forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theater, Hollywood</p>
<p>The forecourt to this historical Hollywood landmark features the hand and footprints of some of the biggest stars in history.</p>
<p>But this intimate look at Hollywood's hands can get a bit grimy, given that millions of fans place their fingers in the moulds of their favourites.</p>
<p>You may think about bringing some gloves or hand sanitizer before comparing your own paws to those of the greats.</p>

<p>Two additional H1N1 vaccination clinics will open this weekend, the City of Ottawa announced Friday.</p>
<p>One clinic will be held at The Ottawa Hospital's Riverside campus, at 1967 Riverside Dr. It will operate from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. today and Sunday, but will have a limited number of shots available.</p>
<p>No other hospital sites or emergency rooms will offer public vaccinations.</p>
<p>A one-day roving clinic will be held today at the Cyrville Recreation Centre, 4355 Halmont Dr., from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p>
<p>A list of fixed vaccination sites can be found at www.ottawa.ca/health[http://www.ottawa.ca/health] or by contacting the Ottawa Public Health information line at 613-580-6744.</p>
<p>In the the Outaouais there was a sixth death attributed to the H1N1 virus Friday, one more than in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Céline Jacob, a spokeswoman for the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de l'Outaouais, said the unnamed 58-year-old female victim had chronic health problems before she became ill with the virus.</p>

<p>After losing to Stefan Psenak by one vote in a judicial recount following Gatineau's civic election, former councillor Frank Thérien is planning to ask Quebec Superior Court to order a new election in Aylmer.</p>
<p>Psenak, 39, was sworn in as the councillor for Aylmer after the Nov. 1 election, along with Mayor Marc Bureau and other council members.</p>
<p>The judicial recount gave 1,789 votes to Psenak and 1,788 votes to Thérien, 68. The recount was held after Thérien won the first count by two votes.</p>
<p>Thérien, who served 10 years on Aylmer council and four years on Gatineau council, said he might have had more support if so many seniors had not been afraid to vote because of the H1N1 flu virus. He said the voter turnout in Aylmer was only 33 per cent.</p>
<p>Psenak, the owner of a translation and communication company, is one of three members of the civic movement Project Gatineau elected to council. The movement, which does not yet call itself a civic political party, favours an overall planning vision for Gatineau as Quebec's fourth largest city instead of concentrating mostly on district issues.</p>
<p>Immediately after the recount, Thérien said he was disappointed, but had decided to retire, travel and spend more time with his children in Texas. On Friday, he said that he found life dull with nothing to do and already missed his city council job.</p>
<p>"There was a ballot missing that was used by someone that they never found," Thérien said. "Your guess is as good as mine about what happened --it could have ended up on the floor or maybe somebody pocketed the darn thing.</p>
<p>"There is a precedent in Quebec during the 1980s where the judge ordered a new election. We are asking the judge to declare a new election because of the lost ballot."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 + H5N1 = Worst-case scenario; Health experts watch closely as swine flu meets avian flu</b>
</div><div>Alan Sipress   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1844 words</div><div>21 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>When swine flu erupted this spring in the southwestern United States and Mexico, it had been 40 years since the last flu pandemic. The outbreak has dispelled any illusion that pandemic influenza belonged to a bygone era, like smallpox, polio or scarlet fever. But we haven't seen how bad things might yet get.</p>
<p>What's the worst-case scenario? It could be a continuing vaccine shortage. It might be a mutation in the swine flu virus that suddenly makes the strain resistant to Tamiflu, as some seasonal flu strains already are. Or it could be that hospital ICUs become so overwhelmed that people who could have been saved die.</p>
<p>These are all unnerving possibilities. Yet many flu specialists say their real nightmare is that swine flu could meet up and swap genetic material -- or reassort, as these scientists say -- with another, deadlier flu strain, breeding a new virus that is as contagious as but far more savage.</p>
<p>Such a strain is already circulating in Asia and Africa, and it could be ready for a chance encounter with swine flu. It is called bird flu.</p>
<p>Unlike swine flu, which is no worse than a seasonal flu bug for most people, bird flu kills more than half of those who contract it. Bird flu preys on the young and healthy, ravaging their lungs -- reminiscent of the 1918 flu that killed up to 50 million people.</p>
<p>So far, scientists haven't found proof that swine and bird flu will merge and spawn a deadlier virus. But the prospect is so chilling that health officials have been warning about it since earlier this year. Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization, urged public health experts not to take their eyes off H5N1 bird flu even as H1N1 swine flu was sweeping the globe.</p>
<p>"No one can say how this avian virus will behave when pressured by large numbers of people infected with the new H1N1 virus," she told an assembly of the world's top health officials. Separately, she appealed to Asian health ministers: "Do not drop the ball on monitoring H5N1."</p>
<p>Influenza is a cruel wonder of nature, one of the most promiscuous microbes. Its viruses have a rare gift for swapping genetic material with one another: The genetic material in a flu virus, unlike in nearly all other viruses, is composed of segments that can be individually replaced. If two different strains invade the same cell, they can trade attributes, then dispatch that progeny back into the world. So the WHO and other health agencies are watching closely as swine flu spreads to countries where bird flu is well established.</p>
<p>I tracked bird flu for several years starting in 2004 in nine Asian countries, from jungle villages to squalid urban quarters, run-down hospitals and cutting-edge labs. I discovered how economic, political and cultural realities were conspiring to imperil us. In a single generation, East Asia's surging demand for protein has led to an explosion in poultry farming, and these flocks have become perfect breeding grounds for a pandemic strain. Meanwhile, age-old customs facilitated the virus's spread.</p>

<p>Fukuda, now WHO's top flu official, says he remains humbled by flu's stubborn unpredictability.</p>
<p>Already, the swine flu epidemic has chastened us by revealing the sorry state of our antiquated technology for producing vaccines and the limits of our brittle, underfunded system for emergency medical care. But swine flu is not merely a warning shot. The virus itself could be the catalyst for a new flu -- and an even deadlier pandemic.</p>
<p>Alan Sipress is author of The Fatal Strain: On the Trail of Avian Flu and the Coming Pandemic.</p>
<p>Photo: reminiscent of the 1918 flu that killed up to 50
million people. So far, scientists haven't found proof that swine
and bird flu will merge and spawn a deadlier virus. But the prospect
is so chilling that health officials have been warning about it
since earlier this year. Margaret Chan, director general of the
World Health Organization, urged public health experts not to take
their eyes off H5N1 bird flu even as H1N1 swine flu was sweeping the
globe. "No one can say how this avian virus will behave when
pressured by large numbers of people infected with the new H1N1
virus," she told an assembly of the world's top health officials.
Separately, she appealed to Asian health ministers: "Do not drop the
ball on monitoring H5N1." Influenza is a cruel wonder of nature, one
of the most promiscuous microbes. Its viruses have a rare gift for
swapping genetic material with one another: The genetic material in
a flu virus, unlike in nearly all other viruses, is composed of
segments that can be individually replaced. If two different strains
invade the same cell, they can trade attributes, then dispatch that
progeny back into the world. So the WHO and other health agencies
are watching closely as swine flu spreads to countries where bird
flu is well established. I tracked bird flu for several years
starting in 2004 in nine Asian countries, from jungle villages to
squalid urban quarters, run-down hospitals and cutting-edge labs. I
discovered how economic, political and cultural realities were
conspiring to imperil us. In a single generation, East Asia's
surging demand for protein has led to an explosion in poultry
farming, and these flocks have become perfect breeding grounds for a
pandemic strain. Meanwhile, age-old customs facilitated the virus's
spread. In Thailand, I went to cockfights at makeshift arenas where
fans crowded around birds that may be carrying the disease. At live
poultry markets, where the air was rank with the odour of chickens
and ducks, and the floors slick with their blood, I saw how people
and livestock were crammed together, a crucial nexus in the spread
of the virus. Several Asian countries covered up their bird flu
outbreaks, sometimes until it was too late to contain the virus's
spread, then later claimed to have cornered the virus. But it keeps
coming back, and each time it gets another chance to reassort with
another virus. And now, along comes swine flu. Although its
mortality rate is well below 1 per cent, there have already been
tens of millions of cases worldwide. Is this more contagious virus
the key that might unlock bird flu's terrible full potential? Swine
flu is so new that researchers have yet to plumb its secrets. How
exactly is it transmitted, how does it attack the body, and why, in
very few cases, is it catastrophic? Could it reassort with another

</div><div>Mark Zwolinski   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>498 words</div><div>21 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>S01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>There isn't one or two Marlies on the radar as potential call-ups should the Leafs undergo a roster shakeup.</p>
<p>There's at least six, and that's only the forwards.</p>
<p>While the Leafs' AHL affiliate is off to a mediocre 7-6-3 start, the club's roster boasts the promise of the top club's U.S. college connection - Christian Hanson, Tyler Bozak and Viktor Stalberg - as well as some names who haven't been circulated as much.</p>
<p>Ryan Hamilton, for instance, acquired last January from Minnesota for Robbie Earl, has turned heads within the organization even though he wasn't a factor in the Leafs' pre-season, where the collegians and first-round pick Nazem Kadri grabbed the spotlight.</p>
<p>Marlies' captain Ben Ondrus, like Hamilton, remains a reliable player capable of adding grit, energy and sound two-way play. Jiri Tlusty is a strong call-up candidate, while on defence, Jurag Minkus has quietly played himself into consideration.</p>
<p>"It's tough, for sure," Bozak said Friday in a phone interview from Cleveland when asked whether the Leafs' situation is a distraction for the Marlies.</p>
<p>"All of us, our No.1 goal is to play in the NHL, we all want to do that. But you have to be patient," Bozak said. "We all have a job to do and we're playing with the Marlies and that should be the most important thing on our minds."</p>
<p>Bozak's story, which involves a bout with H1N1 and a bumpy road to recovery, is a great example of the difficult transition from college or junior to the AHL, and then the Leafs.</p>
<p>Bozak, like Stalberg, Hanson and the rest of the young prospects, were in a tough rookie tournament even before Leafs' training camp started. When camp opened, it included the obvious regimens, but it also included a heavy schedule of up to eight exhibition games.</p>
<p>Combine that with a lack of proper nutrition, and Bozak was a prime candidate to contract the illness.</p>
<p>"We did a lot of cooking in college and I learned to cook a lot of fast things (foods)," Bozak said. "Now I'm talking to nutritionists here and I think it's helping me a lot more."</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Marlies have shown patience with Bozak during his recovery, but they are forced to press him harder in practice so he can attain the level of fitness to make the next step to the NHL.</p>
<p>Bozak and the rest of the prospects will remain on the radar for the time being, but the Leafs appear to be pursuing change through trades first.</p>

<p>JOHN McDERMOTT</p>
<p>McDermott may spend a good chunk of the year on the road, but he never fails to show up in Toronto to put his down-homey spin on holiday favourites - in a show dubbed "Sharing Christmas" - in the company of an eclectic collection of musical friends. This year it includes the Arrogant Worms, Guido Basso, Larry Gowan, Dave Young, Russell De Carle and Erica Goodman.</p>
<p>Details: Dec. 22 and 23 at the Glenn Gould Studio, 250 Front St. W. Tickets: $45 at 416-872-4255 or www.roythomson.com[http://www.roythomson.com].</p>
<p>John Terauds</p>
<p>HANNAFORD STREET SILVER BAND & AMADEUS CHOIR Nothing says Christmas better than this 24-member brass band and 100-voice choir, in what is usually a pretty traditional selection of carols and anthems. Late Canadian Opera Company general director Richard Bradshaw used to take on the conducting duties at this concert, but now it's David Briskin, the music director of the National Ballet Orchestra. Lydia Adams leads the Amadeus Choir. It's no surprise that organizers call this one The Majesty of Christmas.</p>
<p>Details: Dec. 14 at Metropolitan United Church, Queen and Church Sts. Tickets: $12-$35, 416-366-7723 or www.stlc.com[http://www.stlc.com].</p>
<p>CANADIAN BRASS It's been 35 years since the Canadian Brass gave its first concert, so Torontonians sometimes take them a bit for granted. But this accomplished quintet is known around the world as one of the best, and their musical arrangements are used by brass ensembles everywhere. These guys are at their bright-and-shiny best every December, in the company of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. This year, there's extra vocal support from the Mississauga Choral Society. John Morris Russell conducts. And there are plenty of sing-along opportunities, too.</p>
<p>Details: Roy Thomson Hall, 60 Simcoe St. Tickets: $26-$70 for Dec. 23 matinee; $28-$99 for Dec. 22 and 23 evenings, at www.tso.ca[http://www.tso.ca] or 416-598-3375.</p>
<p>John Terauds</p>
<p>ST. MICHAEL'S CHOIR SCHOOL</p>
<p>Welcome to the magical choral world of Toronto's only full-time choir school, the alma mater to some of the country's great vocalists, including Michael Schade, Matt Dusk and Michael Burgess. Every year, the kids, who range from the primary, middle and high-school grades, present a festive program that reflects their wide range of ethnic backgrounds as well as their main role in the Saturday and Sunday masses conducted every week at St. Michael's Cathedral. This year's program includes Dancing Day, a piece that includes harp, by English composer John Rutter. William O'Meara accompanies on organ.</p>
<p>Details: Dec. 11 and 12 at Massey Hall, Victoria and Shuter Sts. Tickets: $22.50-$36.50 at www.roythomson.com[http://www.roythomson.com] or 416-872-4255.</p>
<p>PUPPETMONGERS</p>
<p>There comes a point in every holiday season when even the most understanding and patient of parents run the risk of exploding if they have to cope with one more high-energy, in-your-face, top-of-the-voice family entertainment. It's to preserve our sanity at just such moments that Puppetmongers have been plying their trade for the past 20 Decembers. Ann and David Powell, the co-directors of the group, are also brother and sister and true masters of the art of puppetry. Their work is elegant, detailed, loving and lovely. This year's show is a revival of Cinderella in Muddy York, one of their most charming works. It takes the age-old story of the poor, oppressed Ella and adapts it to an 1834 setting in "Muddy York," as Toronto was known back then. She doesn't go to the ball to meet the prince, but instead winds up at Government House, dancing with the son of the lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada. It's all done with wit and economy and adults enjoy it every bit as much as younger audience members.</p>
<p>Details: Dec. 19 to Jan. 1 at the Tarragon Extra Space, 30 Bridgman Ave. Tickets: $13-$16 at www.puppetmongers.com[http://www.puppetmongers.com] or 416-469-3555.</p>

<p>ROBIN HOOD, THE ENVIRONMENTAL FAMILY MUSICAL</p>
<p>When you're in Toronto, the aroma that announces the yuletide season isn't chestnuts roasting on an open fire, but the headier scent of baked ham ... theatrical ham, that is. It wouldn't be the holidays if Ross Petty and his troupe of intrepid entertainers didn't conspire to wreak havoc on yet another beloved story from the annals of family literature. This year, it's Robin Hood that gets the topsy-turvy treatment, and the starry cast includes Jeff Irving (fresh from The Sound of Music) in the title role, with Canadian Idol winner Eva Avila as Maid Marion, the Royal Canadian Air Farce's Jessica Holmes as the Good Fairy and Petty as the Sheriff of Nottingham. You don't review a cast that hammy. You just get your swine flu shot and hope for the best.</p>
<p>Details: Nov. 26 to Jan. 3 at the Elgin Theatre, 189 Yonge St. Tickets: $55-$79 at www.rosspetty.com[http://www.rosspetty.com] or 416-872-5555.</p>
<p>Richard Ouzounian</p>
<p>THE NUTCRACKER</p>
<p>Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker is as much a cow as a ballet - a cash cow with candy-coated, non-trademarked brand-name appeal that reaps much-needed profits for financially stretched dance companies across North America.</p>
<p>Some U.S. troupes rely on it for as much as 70 per cent of their total annual income. Without The Nutcracker they'd be doomed. Things are less dire in Canada, where public subsidies at least partly reduce dependence on box-office takings. Even so, bean counters at the National Ballet annually bite their nails over whether they'll meet their Nutcracker "target," since it accounts for close to a third of annual box office revenue. A little snow helps put folks in the seasonal ticket-buying spirit, but a call-in-the-troops-style storm can have serious financial repercussions.</p>
<p>Fortunately, former artistic director James Kudelka's spectacular 1995 Nutcracker has handsomely repaid the more than $2 million it cost the company to create. It's not just the wildly colourful sets and costumes by ace American designer Santo Loquasto. Kudelka is one of the smartest choreographers around, and his account of a trip to the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy is full of witty surprises and sly hints of family dysfunction amidst the constant bickering of its prepubescent sibling protagonists. It's as satisfying for adult ballet devotees as it is for the thousands of little kids who sit wide-eyed through its two hours of theatrical magic. There are not many Nutcracker ballets around that can claim that distinction.</p>
<p>Details: Dec. 12 to Jan. 3 at the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, 145 Queen St. W. Tickets: $20-$210 at www.national.ballet.ca[http://www.national.ballet.ca].</p>
<p>Michael Crabb</p>
<p>NATHANIEL DETT CHORALE</p>
<p>Canada's only Afrocentric choir radiates a deep, bright blue in what has become a 21st-century holiday tradition for them: something they call An Indigo Christmas. This is basically a collection of Christmastide favourites from the Gospel, Caribbean and African traditions, with a bit of contemporary pop thrown in for good measure. The diverse group, led by founding artistic director Brainerd Blyden-Taylor, is usually joined by special guests. The intimate Glenn Gould Studio should give the concert a special energy.</p>
<p>Details: Dec. 16 and 19 at 250 Front St. W. Tickets: $39.50 at 416-872-4255 or www.roythomson.com[http://www.roythomson.com].</p>

</div><div>Joseph Hall   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>796 words</div><div>21 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>IN04</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Months of dire swine flu warnings were a dangerous, disruptive cry of "wolf" for an ailment Canadian health officials knew would be a mild, manageable beast.</p>
<p>That's the pointedly caustic judgement of Dr. Richard Schabas, a one-time provincial health officer who says flu experts knew in July that H1N1 would hold little threat for Canadians this fall.</p>
<p>Schabas, now Medical Officer of Health for Hastings and Prince Edward Counties, says many of his colleagues fed a credulous media with worst-case warnings while downplaying the flu strain's relative weakness.</p>
<p>"I think the media has to get its head around just how massive an overplay this was. I am quite sure that there has been more high-level coverage of this than all other health stories combined."</p>
<p>By the time this second H1N1 wave peters out in December, it will have killed between 200 and 300 Canadians - making it one-tenth as lethal as the seasonal flus that strike the country annually.</p>
<p>What's more, Schabas says, evidence from the southern hemisphere, where the flu is a spring and summer scourge, conclusively anticipated this comparatively low death toll.</p>
<p>In particular, H1N1's May and June run through Australia, which mirrors Canada in its health care capabilities, showed the virus was a temperate one.</p>
<p>"By their measures, things like physicians' visits and the like, this was no different than a usual flu year," says Schabas of the Australian experience. "In fact, it was milder."</p>
<p>But even after its terrifying Mexican debut in April, where it was blamed for hundreds of deaths, health officials knew that H1N1 had no apocalyptic potential.</p>
<p>"Within about a week of the first stories out of Mexico, it was becoming clear that the death toll (there) was in the order of hundreds, not tens of thousands," Schabas says.</p>
<p>"And a mild pandemic in Mexico would be expected to kill 30,000 people."</p>
<p>Schabas says accumulating evidence of the ailment's mildness indicated conclusively by early July that it posed no pestilential threat.</p>
<p>Schabas also contends there was no evidence the virus was capable of rapid mutation, of morphing into a more lethal strain.</p>
<p>That the disease appeared to be targeting the young was worrisome to many and gave credence to the ominous public health pronouncements.</p>
<p>But this too was a canard, says Schabas, who argues that young people are always more apt to catch influenzas and that the incidence of H1N1 appeared higher among them largely because many elderly people had pre-existing immunity and didn't get sick.</p>
<p>As with almost any flu, however, young people's robust immune systems are able to fight off the infection in the vast majority of cases, Schabas says.</p>
<p>And the tragic death of 13-year-old Toronto hockey player Evan Frustaglio, which galvanized the nation's attention on the disease, did not warrant the ensuing panic.</p>
<p>While mortality rates among people 20 and younger in Canada will be slightly higher than in a normal flu season, the actual number of deaths among healthy youngsters will be in the range of just seven, Schabas says.</p>
<p>"The risk of a young person being killed by a car in Ontario ... is 100 or more times higher than the risk of being killed by H1N1."</p>
<p>Finally, Schabas argues, public health officials have cried wolf many times in the recent past, with bird flu, West Nile and flesh-eating disease warnings. Even SARS killed just 800 people worldwide, he says, when deaths in the tens of millions were being forecast. Such "fear mongering" undermines their credibility.</p>
<p>Schabas says there is a growing medical consensus that some apocalyptic plague is lurking out there - in a Chinese poultry farm or an African jungle - just itching to swoop down on humanity. But all such fears have proven false in the past and are unlikely to be warranted in the future.</p>
<p>"For the past five or six years, lots of public health officials, nationally, provincially, internationally, have been warning people about the dreaded bird flu pandemic. It hasn't happened, it hasn't killed anybody in the Western hemisphere."</p>
<p>A proper media role, Schabas says, is to remind health officials of their past pronouncements and to throw a blanket of scepticism over future pandemic fires.</p>
<p>And any hyperventilating coverage of an H1N1 "third wave" - predicted for the spring - would be a sham, Schabas says.</p>
<p>"They (health officials) sound like burnt-out surfers sitting on a beach, watching the waves go in and out and arguing the next one will be better."</p>

</p>
<p>At the end of April, the world stopped, mid-stride, and slowly turned its eyes toward Mexico.</p>
<p>For a month the deaths there had been quietly mounting. Twenty people, 60, 100. Mostly they were young and healthy. Mostly they were felled in days.</p>
<p>Within weeks the severe respiratory illness - quickly identified as a new and virulent form of swine flu - would spread to pockets across the globe, in a classic pattern of pandemic.</p>
<p>But fear spread faster. And unlike the H1N1 virus - which proved a relatively mild pestilence - that fear would grow in its potency.</p>
<p>Sometime in the past week, H1N1 hit its peak across Canada. And from this infectious apex, we can look forward with a growing consensus.</p>
<p>Far from apocalyptic, H1N1 was a mild form of influenza, by almost any measure. It will have killed just 200 to 300 Canadians by the time this largest wave peters out completely in mid-December. That's far fewer than the thousands who die every year in this country from commonplace seasonal varieties.</p>
<p>Looking back, however, the picture is murkier.</p>
<p>Did public health officials overplay those relatively innocuous dangers? Was the hyperventilating coverage of the ailment justified? And was there, reasonably, anything to fear in the first place?</p>
<p>Two of the country's top public health officials weigh in on the issue today - with very different perspectives about the governmental and media roll out of H1N1.</p>

<p>McMaster has fallen from the ranks of the undefeated in Ontario university women's basketball.</p>
<p>After recording three straight wins to open conference play, the Marauders fell 70-59 to the Laurentian Lady Vees at the Ben Avery Gym in Sudbury last night.</p>
<p>"I thought we played like a young team tonight," McMaster coach Theresa Burns said in a telephone interview. "We weren't reading the play on the court as well as we have been.</p>
<p>"Lakehead did everything right to get their veteran posts the ball. We didn't have an answer for that."</p>
<p>Lisa Furchner and Darrah Bumstead led the Laurentian front-court with 22 and 12 points, respectively. Each added eight rebounds as the Voyageurs won the battle of the boards, 40-31.</p>
<p>The other top scorer for 3-3 Laurentian was Norma Jean Roberts, who tossed in 14.</p>
<p>Mac, which trailed 34-26 at the half, fell behind by as many as 20 points early in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Taylor Smith led the Mac attack with 15 points. Taylor Chiarot contributed 14 and Rebecca Rewi added 11.</p>
<p>"We didn't shoot well and you could just see us getting tighter and tighter," Burns said. " We were terrible at the foul line, particularly in the first half."</p>
<p>McMaster made only 21 of its 63 field goal attempts, while Laurentian connected on 25 of 55. From the foul line, Marauders shot 52.4 per cent (11 of 21).</p>
<p>"Individual defence was not there tonight. That let us down. We went an entire game having to play help defence. You can't win games that way."</p>
<p>In the men's contest, the nationally fifth-ranked Marauders won their fourth game in five starts with an 81-68 decision over the East Division Voyageurs.</p>
<p>McMaster outscored the home side 27-14 in the third quarter to pull away. The score at the intermission was 35-33 for Mac.</p>
<p>Veteran guard Tyrell Vernon led McMaster's scoring with 23 points. Keenan Jeppesen contributed 21 and Cam Michaud added 11 points.</p>
<p>Five-year veteran Matas Tirilis replied with 14 for the 2-3 Voyageurs.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the league, the RMC women's team forfeited this weekend's games against Western and Windsor due to a number of injuries and institutional academic restrictions.</p>
<p>Both Mac teams play at York tonight, beginning with the women's game at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>The McMaster women's game against Toronto, postponed recently because of an outbreak of H1N1 flu in the Toronto lineup, has been rescheduled for Wednesday, Dec. 2 at Mac's Burridge Gym. Tip-off is 6 p.m.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Some programs closed by H1N1 set to restart</b>

<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>743 words</div><div>21 November 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A07</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>Halton is restarting key public health programs that were temporarily shut down by H1N1.</p>
<p>Hamilton is planning to follow suit by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Scores of programs, including prenatal classes, support for students in schools, vaccinations other than H1N1, help for new moms and health promotion had to be put on the back burner while public health redirected dozens of staff to H1N1.</p>
<p>At the pandemic's peak at the end of October, Halton was immunizing 6,000 people a day and getting 1,600 calls daily about H1N1.</p>
<p>That has now dropped to about 3,500 vaccinations and about 250 calls a day.</p>
<p>As a result, Halton's medical officer of health Dr. Bob Nosal is sending some staff back to their regular jobs so key services, particularly for new moms and those needing mental health support, can start up again.</p>
<p>However, public health staff in schools and health promotion programs such as anti-smoking, good nutrition and increased physical activity will remain shut down. School vaccinations programs set to run in November and December will be postponed until the New Year.</p>
<p>"We'd rather not (have them shut down)," said Nosal. "But it's doable."</p>
<p>Hamilton has over a dozen programs that remain shut down including support to schools, new moms, women and some health promotion.</p>
<p>Public health hopes to have most programs running again by the end of the month.</p>
<p>The cost of H1N1 for Hamilton and Halton isn't known yet. Hamilton is expected to provide estimates to the board of health Monday. Past estimates have topped $4 million for Hamilton.</p>
<p>Overwhelming demand for vaccines, assessment and advice required public health to beef up its staff. Hamilton hired 128 casual workers to help the 232 staff working on H1N1 at its peak. It also had seven staff from other departments deployed to H1N1.</p>
<p>Halton hired 165 casual nurses to help out the 70 staff nurses working on H1N1. It used a temp agency to provide eight to 10 staff at each vaccine clinic to do registration.</p>
<p>Other city departments and the Red Cross donated about 1,000 volunteer hours mostly to crowd control when clinic lineups reached five to six hours long.</p>
<p>Nosal said he expects the casual nurses will now be able to handle much of the H1N1 demand as the number of flu shot clinics decrease. That frees up staff nurses to restart programs.</p>
<p>Communicable disease staff are back at their regular jobs.</p>
<p>The region's mental health clinic and other similar support is now running at about 80 per cent.</p>
<p>And all programs for pregnant and new moms are starting again except for weekly peer support groups for moms of babies under one.</p>

</div><div>By Lindor Reynolds    </div>

<p>They are the unpaid front-line workers in the battle against a raging pandemic.</p>
<p>Many are seniors. Some are students. A handful are men. What they have in common is a drive to help others. It's the same urge that flourishes when our city faces natural disasters, when people go hungry or charities need a boost.</p>
<p>Since the H1N1 clinics opened in October, the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority has been averaging 125 volunteers a day. They usually work four-hour shifts. Some stay longer when necessary.</p>
<p>In the past six weeks, these unsung volunteers have amassed 5,292 hours in the clinics.</p>
<p>"The city of Winnipeg is just amazing," says Suzie Matenchuk, manager of volunteer services for the WRHA. "When there's a need, people come out."</p>
<p>The staff who administer the vaccine have volunteered to be there. They're still getting a paycheque.</p>
<p>The folks who register clients, who make sure they know how to fill out their forms, who call out numbers and who watch over people in the recovery area are there because they know they are needed.</p>
<p>Marsha Stewart, a 28-year-old Winnipeg Technical College student, calls out numbers.</p>
<p>"Forty-five, 46, 47, please line up against the wall."</p>
<p>She's kitted out in a yellow fluorescent vest, the sort you'd expect to see on a road crew. All the volunteers are easily identifiable.</p>
<p>Stewart says the most common question she gets is how long the wait will be.</p>
<p>"They've heard the lines are three or four hours long," she says. "They're not here, at least not now. We're really organized."</p>
<p>Her advice?</p>
<p>"The thing they need to do is read the fact sheet. A lot of them are just putting them down. You need to know what to look for."</p>
<p>Stewart had her shot Wednesday. She had to go home. "I was in pain all over. I was cold, I didn't feel well."</p>
<p>Friday morning, she was back volunteering and feeling fine.</p>
<p>Fern Lee, a grandmother of two, wanted to help in any way she could.</p>
<p>"I like to volunteer. I'm not really sure why I volunteered here. I guess I thought they might have a shortage," says Lee.</p>
<p>She says part of the job is soothing people who are worried about the injection. "Some are a little bit scared," she says. "I usually just laugh it off, relax them. I tell them vampires don't bite."</p>
<p>With a smile, she hustles back to the registration table at East Kildonan's Holy Eucharist parish hall.</p>
<p>"Sixty, 61, 62," sings Stewart.</p>
<p>Pam McKechnie is a retiree. She was once an occupational therapist. She also worked at the Selkirk Mental Health Centre.</p>
<p>Because her husband is dependent on home care, she can only volunteer for short periods of time.</p>
<p>"I think it's important to do this," she says. "I like the challenge."</p>
<p>She has sat on a variety of boards and put in countless hours of volunteer time. The fight against H1N1 seemed to be a good use of her time.</p>
<p>"I felt they needed me."</p>
<p>The clinic is a scene of controlled chaos. Children scream as they get their shot. Most people roll up their sleeves and wait stoically.</p>
<p>Monique Jacques, 29, is a classmate of Stewart's.</p>
<p>She says she volunteered because she knew health-care workers would need the help.</p>
<p>"I want to work in health care so this seemed like a good idea."</p>
<p>She's holding a scanner, the sort you'd see in a checkout line.</p>
<p>She runs it over every patient, making sure they've had their shot and are spending enough time in the recovery area.</p>
<p>And Marsha Stewart continues: "Sixty-six, 67, 68 ...."</p>
<p>John Warkentin, number 67, says he's grateful for the staff and volunteers. He figures the vaccine is what stands between our city and a devastating health crisis. "If we all get really sick, we don't have the health-care facilities to take care of all of us," he says.</p>
<p>"The treatment here was excellent. I waited in line about 10 minutes. Everyone in line was very well-behaved. They were quietly moving people with kids to the front. No one minded that."</p>
<p>"Seventy, 71, 72 ...."</p>
<p>Dr. Sande Harlos, the WRHA's medical officer of health, says there was a steep learning curve when the clinics opened.</p>
<p>A vaccination of this magnitude is complex.</p>
<p>"I think the role of the volunteers is huge," she says.</p>
<p>"People are feeling like they're accompanied and given information and feeling guided. You're already relaxed.</p>
<p>"We're so appreciative of the volunteers," she says. "In this city we're very accomplished at pulling together and helping."</p>
<p>"Eighty-three, 84, 85 ....."</p>

<p>Playwright and screenwriter Michel Marc Bouchard has found fame both in his native Quebec and farther afield, sculpting and adapting many of his nearly 30 French-language plays to the tastes of new audiences. But his latest offering, The Madonna Painter, adds a new twist: Commissioned and written in Italy, it was first performed in Italian in Florence. On Thursday, his tale of small-town Quebec during the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918 premiered in English at Factory Theatre in Toronto. We sat down with him to discuss fear, lies, the church and the demands on his writing.</p>
<p>The play depicts a community looking for some protection from the Spanish Flu. Are there present-day lessons about H1N1 to be learned from your play?</p>
<p>I think fear may be the only connection, because the flu is a plague, and a plague came from God at this period [1918], not from a virus. But fear is an important thing in the play, because it's the first weapon of the church sometimes. And the flu is more efficient for the fear [it creates] than for the sickness itself. … I chose kind of a dark period; we are in the First World War, and it's a really dark, medieval period in terms of the church. But it's not a charge [criticism] against Catholics, I must be precise about that. I just use that [religion] as a vocabulary.</p>
<p>You've described your play as ‘a bouquet of lies disguised as a fable.' Is this a tale without a moral?</p>
<p>My work is more impressive than didactical or pedagogical. My story is a tale, and that means I'm working by impressive scenes, not didactical or pedagogical scenes. In the end, I don't know if I am moral or not. But I hope I live to have a few good questions to share.</p>
<p>The word ‘lies' surfaces again and again around this play. Why the preoccupation?</p>
<p>Lies [are] always there in my work. The show, for me, it's a motivation to try to find the truth in the middle of the lies. My next play will be about big lies. I truly believe lies [are] more pro-active than truth for a writer. We always say theatre or art is talking about love, hate and death. But I think, add lies. … And for me, church dogma, it's lies, because it's a fabrication of reality, and suddenly it becomes more political than spiritual.</p>
<p>Are you religious?</p>
<p>No, I consider myself agnostic. But I grew up under such a huge Catholic influence, and all my mythology and vocabulary onstage, it became Catholic. I have this idea of, when I am onstage, it's kind of a procession. It's something sacred.</p>
<p>You named the setting of your play after your home region, Lac Saint-Jean</p>
<p>Yes, it's a real story. In 1952, an Italian painter came to my parish to make a fresco about the Holy Virgin and decided to pick a model from the congregation, and he had auditions. For the community, it was something big because someone, a foreigner, came there. He's the painter of God, so he's almost sacred, and he decided which girl. It's like a Hollywood producer going now into a town and finding the next star, because the lady picked, she will be the Madonna, she will be really close to Heaven. And we had such a rumour about [the painter] in my community, about his flirting.</p>
<p>But the characters in the play, they're not the people from your town. …</p>
<p>Absolutely, no. Because they don't speak the language of my town. It's not a vernacular. I don't try to be naturalistic in my vocabulary. It's a little bit poetic, there's a lot of lyricism.</p>
<p>How has your work on screenplays shaped your career?</p>
<p>For 10 years now, a lot of movie producers decided to adapt my plays for the big screen, and I became the screenwriter for my own plays. [The movie Lilies was adapted from his play Les feluettes; the TV movie L'Histoire de l'oie (The Tale of Teeka) was based on the play of the same name.] … Now they offer me [the chance to write] new stuff, but I was a little bit fed up … always returning to some play and destroying the play to make a movie. Because at the finish, you understand the producer is more attracted by the anecdote rather than all of the play. I discovered fast that in movies, the audience doesn't want to hear the author. In theatre, you're there because you want to hear the writer.</p>
<p>The Madonna Painter runs at Toronto's Factory Theatre until Dec. 13.</p>

<p>SOAP AND WATER & COMMON SENSE</p>
<p>The Definitive Guide to Viruses, Bacteria, Parasites, and Disease</p>
<p>By Dr. Bonnie Henry</p>
<p>Anansi, 276 pages, $19.95</p>
<p>Looking for the perfect gift for the incorrigible germaphobes on your Christmas list? Try Bonnie Henry's Soap and Water & Common Sense. There's enough material here to frighten and titillate them until next Christmas. If the salmonella in this year's turkey doesn't get them first, that is.</p>
<p>The rest of us non-germaphobes may be less intrigued. Infectious diseases are not quite the threat to Canadians that Dr. Henry cracks them up to be. A person living in Canada in 2009 is less likely to die from an infectious disease than anyone ever before in the history of the human species. About 20 times as many otherwise healthy Canadians will be killed by cars this year than by the dreaded H1N1 influenza virus, for example. So, if you are concerned about protecting your health, a book on defensive driving would be far more useful.</p>
<p>Subtitled The Definitive Guide to Viruses, Bacteria, Parasites, and Disease, this book is really a quick and superficial guided tour covering virtually the gamut of human infectious diseases in about 250 pages. The book is generally well written, but it fails because it lacks focus.</p>
<p>The reach of Soap and Water exceeds its grasp. The book tries to do too many things, and falls short on all of them. It lacks the precision and reliability of a reference book. While it's rich with interesting anecdote, it's not structured as a history book. It lacks the depth of a policy “think piece.” It does not have the organization or detail of a how-to manual.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there are some great stories here. The dead flamingoes in the Bronx Zoo were the first North American victims of West Nile Virus. The emergency dog-sled relay across Alaska to bring antitoxin to fight a diphtheria outbreak in Nome gave birth to the annual Iditarod race. More storytelling would at least have added entertainment value.</p>
<p>It's hard to know the real audience for this book, but I have no doubt that it will find a readership. If nothing else, Henry's book enjoys an impeccable sense of timing. Driven by the hype over H1N1 influenza, infectious diseases are now the subject of almost unprecedented media attention.</p>
<p>The greatest failing of Soap and Water, as with much of the media coverage, is a lack of perspective. The age of infectious diseases may not be over, as a U.S. surgeon-general famously and prematurely declared in 1959. But the public-health importance of infectious diseases has dropped precipitously, particularly in developed countries such as Canada.</p>
<p>Henry would like us to believe that the threat of infectious diseases is increasing – a devil's brew of persisting threats (e.g. salmonella), new diseases (e.g. AIDS) and the re-emergence of old enemies (e.g. tuberculosis). The evidence speaks to the contrary. Death rates from infectious diseases have been declining steadily in this country for as long as we have kept vital statistics.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis makes a good case in point. In the 19th century, TB was the commonest cause of death in Canada, but rates have been dropping for 150 years. In the past two decades, this drop has levelled off, but at historically low levels – about 200 times less than a century ago. This improvement is due primarily to better living conditions and overall health. Antibiotics and improved medical care are only the icing on the cake.</p>
<p>Henry gets this all very wrong. She talks about TB being “temporarily thwarted in much of the Western world” but now undergoing a “dramatic resurgence” that is “decimating families.” This is hardly an accurate picture of the risk in Canada today or realistic prospects for the future.</p>
<p>Scientifically, Henry is well credentialed and generally reliable. There are, inevitably, a few errors. Jonas Salk used killed viruses in his polio vaccine, a very different technique from Edward Jenner's live cowpox virus vaccine against smallpox. Human rabies is almost unknown in North America, but not because of access to the human rabies vaccine. Rather, it is because we have eliminated wild dog packs. Tetanus is not a traveller's disease. There are plenty of tetanus spores right here at home. The Walkerton E. coli outbreak was a major tragedy, but it was not “the second-largest waterborne outbreak in history,” not even remotely close.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the book's title tells it all. We shouldn't be complacent about infectious diseases, but we shouldn't lie awake at night worrying about them either. A little basic hygiene and a little common sense are all most Canadians need. Be careful with hazardous foods, judicious with your sex life and get the recommended vaccines, and chances are very good that you will live a long and healthy life until cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes call your number. Unless, of course, you get run over by a car on your way to get the H1N1 shot.</p>

<p>Dear Susan,</p>
<p>My workplace, a large college, now has an H1N1 policy that allows students, staff and faculty to self-diagnose and then stay home for a week. I suspect that a fair number of students and colleagues are using this honour system to defer exams and papers and are not really sick. As chairperson, should I suggest that we ask for a doctor's note in suspicious cases?</p>
<p>– PG, Ontario</p>
<p>Dear PG,</p>
<p>Unless you are demonstrating good hygiene habits through 20 seconds of non-stop sudsing, I don't suggest taking matters into your own hands. Asking for a bona fide medical diagnosis will cut down on cheaters, to be sure, but it will also risk spreading the virus in a population that is hardly retiring or risk-averse.</p>
<p>Most students have little natural immunity to this flu strain, one of the few drawbacks of having been born within the last 25 years. They are also prone to engage in high-risk activities, such as gathering in tightly knit groups in cafés, libraries, dorms and lecture halls, hugging, kissing and touching each other's laptops.</p>
<p>These are just a few reasons why they have the second-highest H1N1 hospitalization rate, after infants, of any age group, according to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.</p>
<p>When I checked the CDC's prevention plans and Canada's public health guidelines, both sites suggested that people who think they have H1N1 should simply stay home, without seeking a doctor's confirmation. Why should you be the renegade?</p>
<p>Because cheating is wrong, of course. Allowing some students an extra week to cram and hand in assignments is unfair to straight-shooters. Abusing the self-report system is like plagiarism – it confers an advantage on those who would break the rules.</p>
<p>But it is also the lesser evil, says Daniel Weinstock, the director of the Centre of Research in Ethics at the University of Montreal, and head of Quebec's ethics committee on public health.</p>
<p>“The worst-case scenario would be having our already stretched-to-the-limit medical personnel have to write a bunch of notes. In the present circumstances, tolerating a bit of cheating is the lesser evil,” he wrote in an e-mail.</p>
<p>You'd only be justified in asking for proof if you believe that discouraging cheaters trumps preventing the spread of H1N1. Most institutions and businesses have sided with prevention, said Nicholas King, an assistant professor of biomedical ethics and occupational health at McGill University.</p>
<p>It's really a question of competing values – promoting honesty on the one hand, health on the other. When it comes to the distaste you feel at turning a blind eye to dishonesty, “to maximize health in a community, you often get things you don't like,” Dr. King said. Quarantines during the SARS crisis, mandatory treatment of TB or forced evaluations for violent psychiatric illnesses are what happen when individuals in our society are expected to knuckle under what's best for the group.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of precedents out there that show that the health of the community is of paramount importance,” according to Dr. King.</p>
<p>Ignoring a few small-time cheaters is just another one of those trade-offs.</p>

<p>WEB EXTRA: Olympic flame travels through Nova Scotia</p>
<p>Olympic torchbearer Lena Masters couldn't help but have a teary moment while running the flame through Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley yesterday afternoon, but a far simpler and more dramatic sentiment was running through her mind. "I was just thinking: 'don't drop it,' " said Masters, who carried the torch through Wolfville, N.S.</p>

<p>Silvia Cordero eyed the row of disinfecting gels, soaps and hand sanitizers at a <span class="companylink">Rite-Aid</span> in Culver City with the intensity of a drill sergeant preparing troops for a skirmish with the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>"They're going in my car, in my desk at work, and in my sons' backpacks," Cordero, 28, said. "I don't really like the way any of them feel on my skin, but they might help keep us healthy."</p>
<p>Concerns about the contagiousness and severity of the H1N1 flu strain have generated a boom in the hand sanitizer market. Sales of gels and wipes have soared by 70.5 per cent, from $69.4 million to $118.4 million, in the 24 weeks that ended on Oct. 3, according to data from the <span class="companylink">Nielsen Company</span>.</p>
<p>Driven in large part by businesses seeking to protect employees and customers, sanitizers helped boost earnings at bleach maker Clorox Corp. and were a bright spot in an otherwise difficult period for <span class="companylink">Johnson & Johnson</span>, whose Purell subsidiary is one of main producers of alcohol-based gel cleaners.</p>
<p>Demand for antivirus products has also spawned a cottage industry in personalized sanitizers. Consumers can go online to order them in fur-trimmed pump-bottles on one site or with their company names printed on the front at another.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Pier One Imports</span> is selling holiday-themed sanitizers with such scents as cinnamon and cilantro, packaged as nicely as perfume offerings.</p>
<p>One Internet start-up company is getting so many orders for its disinfecting products from hotels, restaurants and other employers that his suppliers can't keep pace.</p>
<p>"Everything you touch has germs," said Carol Lewis, 65, a Los Angeles resident who keeps hand sanitizer gel in her purse, in her car, and at her home because of concerns about catching H1N1 flu. "I don't know if it's going to protect me, but psychologically it helps."</p>
<p>About one-third of businesses are taking precautions against H1N1, about the same number that prepared for Avian flu and SARS when those viruses were of concern, according to a recent survey by the consulting company <span class="companylink">Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc</span>. But unlike those earlier scares, the H1N1 pandemic materialized -- and sanitizers and disinfectants now seem to be popping up all over.</p>
<p>At <span class="companylink">Ventura Transfer Co</span>. in Long Beach, all employees have been furnished with hand sanitizers, and the company has also stocked up on the N95 particulate filter, respirator and surgical masks.</p>
<p>"We have an obligation to provide our customers with an assurance that we can maintain functionality, that we will be able to handle their products the way they expect them to be handled," said safety manager Jim Cheney.</p>
<p>Bottles of Purell sanitizer sit on every desk at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where signs pronouncing, "clean hands save lives" greet visitors at every turn. The hospital complex has been ordering 2,200 liters per month of the clear gel, nearly twice the amount that it used before the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>"You can't really turn around here without seeing Purell," said Rehka Murthy, Cedars-Sinai's director of hospital epidemiology.</p>
<p>At the Creative Center for Children in Los Angeles, door knobs are cleaned with disinfectant wipes every 90 minutes. So are tabletops in common areas in the school.</p>
<p>Crossroads School in Santa Monica is taking similar steps.</p>
<p>"Our facilities department is cleaning twice daily, paying special attention to doorknobs, handles, railings, and other surfaces frequently touched by multiple people," according to a recent e-mail sent to parents. "In addition, the school provides hand sanitizer in many locations around the campus."</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts like Nik Modi of <span class="companylink">UBS</span> are telling investors that H1N1 is giving businesses a boost in what would have otherwise been another set of dreary, recession-battered earnings reports.</p>
<p>"H1N1, that's the name of the game," said Modi.</p>
<p>Last week, Clorox Corp. reported a 23-per-cent rise in net profits to $157 million in the fiscal first quarter that ended Sept. 30. Most of it was driven by record sales of its Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, said Donald R. Knauss, Clorox chairman and chief executive, who added that demand was so high that the company was diverting part of its manufacturing capability.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Johnson and Johnson</span> of New Brunswick, N.J., makers of Purell Instant Hand Sanitizer, wouldn't release sales figures, but demand has been so high that the company recently put out a statement meant to reassure customers that it would be able to meet demand.</p>
<p>"We are committed to working with our suppliers to attempt to increase production," the company said.</p>
<p>Anticipating the wave of demand, Warren Persky started an Internet operation, handsanitizerstore.com, in September. He advertised with <span class="companylink">Google</span>, ensuring that his company shows up on any search that uses the terms "hand sanitizer" or "hand sanitizers." Customers can get their names printed on the containers.</p>
<p>Business is great.</p>
<p>Persky says that he has gotten so many orders for his pen-style pocket sprayers and half-ounce sanitizing gel products from hotels, restaurants, county health departments, home-care companies, banks and construction companies that his suppliers can't keep up.</p>

</p>
<p>In a black and white photograph, a woman juggles a grumpy baby in a billowing christening gown, and a sign that accuses the government of inciting chaos. Behind her, a crowd of men and women are gathered in front of the Saskatchewan Legislative Building. If the woman's wide-brim hat and paisley dress didn't give away the date of the picture, it could be a photo of a modern protest, maybe people angry over the botched rollout of the H1N1 vaccine or lack of funding for a potentially life-saving treatment.</p>
<p>The accompanying story, almost unfathomably, is that they're protesting medicare. This snapshot of an outraged public ran in the Regina Leader-Post on July 12, 1962, after the medicare bill passed and doctors across the province withdrew services in protest. The photo is No. 56 in 100 Photos That Changed Canada, edited by Mark Reid of The Beaver Magazine.</p>
<p>"I think everyone has this idea that the creation of medicare was this happy-go-lucky thing where everyone woke up and said, 'Hey, of course we deserve medicare' and it was the opposite," says Reid of the photo. "All they know is the medicare plan has forced doctors to quit, and that woman cannot get health care for her baby."</p>
<p>The eye-opening image is one of a handful of photos that were taken in or have a connection to Saskatchewan, but Reid's vision for the book was to have a collection of photos that spoke to the national consciousness, despite where people might live, what culture they descend from, whether they're men or women, young or old. The idea for the collection was hatched when Reid published a 'top 10 photos that changed Canada' story in The Beaver. The final product is a gorgeous coffee-table book that makes Canadian history easily consumable with photos presented in scrapbooked settings adjacent to enlightening one-page essays.</p>
<p>"I had a suspicion that everyone has an iconic photo, which got me thinking, are there photos out there that show shared moments in which we as Canadians all felt something?" Reid recalls. His personal favourite is the award-winning 1980 photo of a silhouetted Terry Fox. Where the magazine focused on the mechanics of how the photo was taken and the photographer's situation, the book concentrates on the photo itself, the story it tells and its impact on Canadians.</p>
<p>Reid started with a list of 300 photos and worked with a group of historians, photo archivists, and writers from across the country over a three-month period to whittle down the list to 100. "We didn't want this to be 100 photos of white guys with mutton chops. We wanted it to be reflective of the mosaic of Canadian people, and so you will find photos of aboriginals, photos of women, and white guys with mutton chops. Put together they make up the fabric of the story of Canada."</p>
<p>Reid is careful to delineate this is not the definitive collection of iconic Canadian photos, that it is just one list his team felt in some way changed Canada. Of course there were many questions to debate. "How many from each province? Which ones speak nationally to us? Which ones speak regionally to us? Can you have too many war photos, too many political photos? The photos from Saskatchewan by no means reflect the entire A to Z of Saskatchewan history. I'm sure you could get together and put together 100 photos that changed Saskatchewan."</p>
<p>While the Saskatchewan photos were far removed from the population and political hub of the country, there were broad implications and reactions to all of them. Take, for instance, two photos concerning Louis Riel.</p>
<p>In the first photo, Riel isn't depicted at all. Instead, the picture shows a railcar full of snoozing soldiers, guns cradled in their arms, and boots up. The soldiers were actually escorting Riel to his trial in Regina on May 22, 1885, but Reid points out the story is about much more than the Metis hero's impending doom. "They had gone out to northern Saskatchewan, fought Riel, captured him and were bringing him back to trial. The only reason they could do that and put down the resistance or rebellion was because they built the railway. Until then Sir John (A. Macdonald) had no more power over Saskatchewan than I do today."</p>
<p>The following photo captures Riel delivering an impassioned plea in court. Reid picked it to capture the power of Riel the orator. The accompanying essay explains that Riel was so persuasive the jury rendered a guilty verdict but with a recommendation of mercy. The judge refused, and the outcome stirred a commotion as far as Quebec, where they saw Riel as a Robin Hood figure, and viewed the verdict as another example that French Canadians would never be treated equally.</p>
<p>To flesh out the story behind each photo, Reid pairs each picture with an essay, written by someone who has a strong personal connection to the photo or expertise on the topic. Photo 27 shows high jumper Ethel Catherwood, the 'Saskatoon Lily,' clearing the bar at the Amsterdam Summer Olympics in 1928. International Olympic Committee member Dick Pound explains in the essay that sexism was rampant at the first games that allowed women to compete, despite the athletic feats claimed by Catherwood and her teammates.</p>
<p>Fast forward 74 years to a photo of the Canadian women's hockey team posing with their gold medals at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games. No explanation is necessary to see the progress made by women in sport, though Pound talks about the many roles these women filled and sacrificed in addition to being hockey players. They had careers, were going to school and raising families, as evidenced by Shaunavon's Hayley Wickenheiser balancing her young son on her knee.</p>
<p>"The funny thing is to see how far we've come and see how far we have to go," says Reid. "Look at the women ski jumpers trying to fight their way into the 2010 games."</p>
<p>Reid was further vindicated in his selection of essayists when former Member of Parliament Deborah Grey wrote about a picture of a rural family raising their hats to a passing train in 1979. It was John Diefenbaker's funeral train. "How fitting it was that he was coming home at the height of the harvest," she writes. "As the funeral train neared, we waited for the sound of the mournful whistle, the one that we would remember forever."</p>
<p>"I'm a 38-year-old man from Nova Scotia," says Reid, now a Winnipeg resident. "When I was young, I couldn't have picked Diefenbaker from a line-up. Deborah, a prairie gal who saw the train go by, could put us in the mind of a Westerner."</p>
<p>For the many revelations and proud moments the book offers, there are as many photos that elicit shame or sorrow.</p>
<p>A photo of three Jewish orphans comes with a heartbreaking story. During the Holocaust, anti-Semitism in Canada was widespread. During that time, Canada accepted only 3,000 persecuted Jews into the country versus the 150,000 taken in by the United States. The children shown in the photo were supposed to be among 1,000 young people saved but by the time the government decided to accept them, it was impossible to even find that many Jewish children left alive.</p>
<p>"It's important to understand it happened and not shy away," says Reid of that photo and many others that are difficult to look at. "It forces you to take a good hard look in the mirror and ask, 'What does it mean to be a Canadian?' "</p>
<p>Another photo, taken in Alberta, will capture any farmer's empathy. It shows a figure in a barren field clouded with dust. Reid thought the photo was 'photoshopped.' "How could this man be sitting in an other-worldly landscape. It's featureless; it looks like the twilight zone. There's nothing but dust and dirt; if that doesn't put into perspective what farmers in Saskatchewan faced during the Dirty Thirties, I don't know what would."</p>
<p>The issue of manipulating photos is front and centre in Over the Top, the iconic Canadian war photo of soldiers on the firing line ready to pass into the killing fields. Essayist Tim Cook describes how the image captures the "anxiety before battle and the unknowingness of soldiers who are about to face death." He then reveals what the country learned decades after the photo was taken. It's a fake.</p>
<p>Cook asks whether that fact strips the photo of its power when it so accurately represented the battle. Reid waffles on the debate over faked photos. "I'm torn myself. Coming from a journalism background, I can see the argument for saying a fake photo is a fake photo and we should discount it, but I understand what Tim is saying." It's just one of many discussions he hopes the book will initiate.</p>
<p>"This book is an attempt to make us as a nation feel something, to care about our country, to care about all the different moments, the good and bad, and to really get a conversation going. If people start talking about the photos, I'll think of this as a really successful project for us."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Journalists & potluck - a recipe for disaster</b>
</div><div>Karen Hall   </div>
<div>The Windsor Star</div>

</p>
<p>Our darling Julian Revin, the self-professed "newbie" in the newsroom, sent a universal e-mail on Wednesday to announce she was planning the Christmas potluck party.</p>
<p>A collective sigh went through the office, but nobody said anything, because Julian was very excited, and we didn't want to hurt her feelings. (Did I mention she's darling?)</p>
<p>But everyone was thinking the same thing: We've been down this road before, and it hasn't always been pretty.</p>
<p>It's not that journalists don't love food. We do, especially when it's free, and particularly when someone else does the cooking.</p>
<p>Typically, we eat at our desks. Sometimes, we eat things that fall under our desks. We aren't afraid of H1N1. Anyone who can find a chunk of chicken in their keyboard and scarf it down -- three days later -- can survive anything.</p>
<p>Perhaps Julian sensed our dysfunction, which is why she included a helpful selection of menu items gleaned from her very own recipe book.</p>
<p>Among the dishes we could consider: couscous, risotto, pasta primavera, stuffed peppers, beef stirfry, cabbage rolls and a black olive tapenade (a what?).</p>
<p>Another sigh went through the newsroom. Preparing these items seemed to require a high level of commitment on the part of staff. Nowhere, for instance, did we find frozen TV dinners, Pop Tarts or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on the list.</p>
<p>This wasn't good; the potential for a culinary disaster was real, and it was weighing on us. We were paralyzed.</p>
<p>Until, suddenly released from a stuffed-pepper stupor, Anne Jarvis jumped to her feet, grabbed a pen and scrawled her name next to the veggie tray. That meant all she had to do was go to the store and buy one, ready-made.</p>
<p>"Hurry," she whispered. "If you get there fast enough, you can grab the cheese and crackers."</p>
<p>I knocked her to the ground on my sprint to the sign-up sheet.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, yes!" I shrieked. "I got cheese and crackers, and guess what? They come pre-made, on a platter. Sorry for your luck, losers!"</p>
<p>(Goodness. Did I say that out loud? My apologies.)</p>
<p>But perhaps the greatest consternation belonged to the men, many of them single, who began to fight for the right to purchase the traditional family pack of assorted Christmas Tim Bits. (Back off, Doug Schmidt.)</p>
<p>The problem with the men is that they are under the impression there is only one food group, and it includes anything that ends in the vowel "o."</p>
<p>You've got your Tostito, Dorito, Frito and Cheeto dish; your nacho and taco platter; the festive holiday mojito sampler and, for those among us who value our health, the Jell-O and Cheerio casserole.</p>
<p>Things got heated when Schmidt tried to bully his way into a second year of Tim Bits.</p>
<p>"Is there no justice?" cried Rob Gurdebeke, before asking: "How do you spell Pepperettes?"</p>
<p>And so it went, until finally someone signed on for the cabbage rolls and Roseann said she'd defrost some meatballs.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how things will go. I only know I'll do my best to talk John Coleman out of bringing his baked bean and SPAM casserole, much as we've come to enjoy it over the last 30 years. (Nothing says Christmas like SPAM.)</p>
<p>But I do know this: Whatever lands in the newsroom we'll eat, because the last thing we want to do is upset Julian, who might, come to think of it, want to bring the Tums.</p>

<p>A brawl broke out in the stands of Anaheim's Honda Center on Thursday night after Ducks defenceman Scott Niedermayer tossed his stick over the glass to celebrate his game-winning goal in overtime. It's believed to be the first time ever that fans were happy when someone gave them the shaft ... Niedermayer was trying to give a gift to a little girl behind the glass, but someone else grabbed the stick and fighting erupted. The way the fans reacted, you'd think Niedermayer was tossing them the last-ever dose of the H1N1 vaccine ... Word out of Vancouver says the Canucks are the latest NHL team to jump the queue to get their H1N1 shots. Once again, a group of men suffers the embarrassment of premature inoculation.</p>
<p>Since the New York Yankees' World Series victory, shortstop Derek Jeter has been a popular guy. "If I had shots with everyone that offered, I'd be drunk all the time," he told the New York Post. That sounds like a dig at Alex Rodriguez, who got in trouble for taking shots that his cousin offered a few years back ... Here's Greg Cote of the Miami Herald: "Baseball general managers meeting in Chicago failed to take a vote on expanding instant replay following a post-season in which several controversies arose from players tripping over umpires' white canes or being chased by guide dogs." ... San Francisco Giants hurler Tim Lincecum, who recently was nabbed with a small amount of marijuana, won the National League Cy Young Award for the second straight season. He's rollin' now!</p>
<p>Hours after Lincecum was honoured, Miami Dolphins tailback Ricky Williams -- who also has a history with weed -- scored three TDs in an NFL victory over the Carolina Panthers. As Janice Hough put it: "It might have been the best day for stoners since they invented Doritos." ... On Monday, the CBS affiliate in Boston cut away from The Price Is Right to show a media conference at which New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick once again tried to explain his failed fourth-down gamble in Sunday's game against the Indianapolis Colts. "Good symmetry," wrote Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe. " 'The Price is Right,' but The Call is Still Wrong."</p>
<p>Brian Billick could be recognized as a former NFL head coach or as an NFL analyst on Fox -- but he isn't. As he told the San Diego Union-Tribune: "I coached for 30 years and got a Super Bowl ring and most people, when they see me now, go, 'Hey, you're that <span class="companylink">Coors Light</span> guy.' " ... San Diego Chargers tailback LaDainian Tomlinson is about to become a dad, so his head coach is prepared to offer some suggestions for baby names. "Not mine," Norval Eugene Turner told the Associated Press. "I'm still mad at my mom about that." ... Former NFL head coach Jerry Glanville recently was fired by Portland State University. "If that's not hitting bottom," wrote Jeff Schultz of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, "I'm assuming the next job involves either bowling shoes or circus elephants."</p>
<p>This week's wacky soccer story comes from England, where Arsenal striker Robin van Persie apparently has decided to undergo radical treatment for a serious ankle injury. He's going to Serbia, where a doctor is to massage his right leg with fluid from a placenta to help speed up the healing process. The treatment doesn't sound very pleasant-a ... Former NBAer Dennis Rodman was held by authorities in Trier, Germany, after hotel staff claimed he hadn't paid his bill. Rodman's room was covered through the "USA Legends of Basketball'' exhibition tour, but his $5,100 bar tab wasn't. That's one expensive package of peanuts from the mini-bar ... The last word this week goes to Milwaukee Bucks centre Andrew Bogut, who told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that he was in great position to grab offensive rebounds during rookie Brandon Jennings' 55-point outing the other day.

<p>Question: Someone was telling me that people over the age of 50 have more immunity against the H1N1 virus than younger people. Is this true? I have fibromyalgia and asthmatic bronchitis, but I don't like the idea of getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>Answer: Public health officials have found that adults born before 1956 have acquired some immunity to H1N1, likely through exposures to similar flu viruses at a young age. This is why these residents are scheduled to receive the vaccine after other at-risk populations.</p>
<p>However, it is highly recommended that individuals of any age with chronic health conditions that place them at risk for severe H1N1 illness receive the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>At this time, all residents with underlying health conditions are eligible to receive the H1N1 shot. These conditions include asthma, diabetes, chronic heart and lung disease, obesity and liver disease, among others.</p>
<p>Based on the amount of vaccine we have been receiving, Saskatchewan public health has targeted the vaccination program to ensure those who are most at-risk have access to the vaccine first.</p>
<p>A complete list of health conditions that make a person at-risk as well as information on H1N1 clinic schedules is available online at your regional health authority's website or through HealthLine at 1-877-800-0002.</p>

<p>Ila Fehr's eight-year-old son Nathan got his H1N1 shot on Nov. 12, but it must be redone.</p>
<p>Neither Nathan nor his mother are impressed he and four other students at Schell School in Holdfast must be re-vaccinated.</p>
<p>Several days after Nathan was immunized, a public health nurse with the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region called Ila to say Nathan had to be re-immunized because the vaccine wasn't mixed properly. Despite the phone call, Ila was confused about why Nathan requires the shot in the arm again.</p>
<p>"I wish I would have asked a few more questions," Ila said. "I'm impressed that they went back and found their mistake and they told us -- they're not letting it go -- but I'm not impressed that Nathan has to get another shot, and neither is Nathan."</p>
<p>It's a case of better safe than sorry, said Dr. Tania Diener, the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region's medical health officer.</p>
<p>She explained that public health nurses prepare 10 doses of the H1N1 vaccine by mixing 2.5 ml of antigen from a vial with 2.5 ml from a vial of adjuvant -- which acts as a booster.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, after they started immunizing, they realized that they left a very small amount of the adjuvant behind in the vial ... We were unclear whether this would have any effect on the immune response the person would build up. In a case where you're not sure, it's better to re-immunize," Diener said.</p>
<p>Prior to contacting the families, health officials checked with the drug manufacturer and were given the go-ahead to re-immunize. Nathan hasn't been re-immunized because he's been feeling under the weather, but he will be soon.</p>
<p>Diener hasn't heard of similar incidents in other areas of the province.</p>
<p>"I think that it's important that as soon as we realize that there's anything wrong that we correct the situation," she said.</p>
<p>Because Nathan is a healthy child, he won't require a second H1N1 vaccination.</p>
