</p>
<p>Progressive Conservative party members gave Premier Ed Stelmach a strong show of support Saturday, defying public sentiment and bolstering his leadership as he enters a trying political period.</p>
<p>Seventy-seven per cent of convention delegates approved Stelmach's leadership. That passes the informal threshold of 70 per cent set by former Premier Ralph Klein and will likely quiet some of Stelmach's most ardent critics.</p>
<p>"We have a very big tent party," Stelmach told party supporters. "And I know that with such a large tent, a large party, there will be a variety of opinions."</p>
<p>Stelmach said he heard one message in particular from delegates.</p>
<p>"Improve your communication. Policies are right for Alberta, but you're not getting the message out."</p>
<p>Still, resounding support from the party is different than resounding support from the public, and Stelmach has faced an autumn of discontent.</p>
<p>From the province's $6.9-billion deficit, to a byelection loss in Calgary, controversial health-care reforms and problems with the H1N1 vaccination program, the premier has had little good news lately.</p>
<p>Most recently, an Environics poll showed his party has fallen from 55-per-cent support across the province to 34 per cent today.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Wildrose Alliance Party, under its new leader, Danielle Smith, has seen its support take off.</p>
<p>Saturday's result won't immediately change the poll or budget numbers, nor will it vaccinate people, but it should give Stelmach some political breathing space as he tries to put together another budget in the midst of a recession.</p>
<p>Stelmach has said an election will take place in March 2012.</p>
<p>By then, he's hoping commodity prices will have turned around and the province will be running surpluses again.</p>
<p>Stelmach's opponents said the victory does little to change the political picture in the province.</p>
<p>"The premier has survived this leadership review, thanks to his ability to motivate his tightly-knit cadre of supporters. But I'm afraid that this won't help him win back the support of the wider public," Liberal Leader David Swann said in a statement.</p>
<p>"His administration has dropped the ball too often for Albertans to forgive."</p>
<p>Smith, the Wildrose party leader, said she won't be doing anything different after the vote.</p>
<p>"This is exactly what we expected, but it goes against what I am hearing across the province," Smith said.</p>
<p>"Albertans are upset with this government for destroying investor confidence in our energy industry, for mishandling our health-care system and for taking us back into deficits."</p>
<p>Going into the convention, there was some griping among Tories that Stelmach was dragging the party down and needed to be replaced in time for the next election.</p>
<p>Even during the convention, there was obvious division over policy, including a tie vote on Bill 50, a piece of legislation to streamline the approval process for power lines.</p>
<p>But in the end, party members said the convention brought them together and hardened their resolve in tough times.</p>
<p>"I think what's happened this weekend is this party has been galvanized around itself and around the leader," Aboriginal Affairs Minister Gene Zwozdesky said.</p>
<p>Tourism Minister Cindy Ady said Stelmach showed this weekend that he can and will listen to grassroots Tories. "We think that he is the right premier in the spot right now," Ady said. "I think the party's saying we trust him as a leader and we're going to work with him."</p>
<p>In total, 1,191 ballots were counted in the mandatory leadership review. Of those, 922 voted against plunging the party into a leadership race.</p>
<p>Edmonton MLA Thomas Lukaszuk said Saturday's result shows they are on the right track, "but there's room for sort of retuning your radar and readjusting some of your policy."</p>
<p>Indeed Stelmach said he is contemplating bigger changes in his government, possibly including a cabinet shuffle. But he won't do it right away. "I need time to think it through," he said. "Again, it will be my timeline."</p>

<p>The province's health super-board fired two Alberta Health Services staff members this week who helped organize a private H1N1 vaccination clinic for about 150 Calgary Flames players, families and staff, after finishing a probe into the controversial queue-jumping. Meanwhile, Alberta announced Friday two more H1N1-related deaths, and the province continued to immunize high-risk groups, including young children and pregnant women.</p>

<p>I have a three-week old baby in my house and the Alberta Health region does not consider my wife or myself high risk? It seems like eastern Canadian provinces consider parents of newborns high risk, but Alberta does not. If the Calgary Flames make the headlines about H1N1, I think the public should be made aware of this. Children six months or older are considered high risk, but my son cannot get the shot because he is too young. Then I think the parents are super high risk.</p>

<p>Re: "Alberta targets high-risk patients at reopening clinics," Nov. 4.</p>
<p>I am appalled at the arrogance and disrespect shown by this Conservative government to the citizens of this great province. I e-mailed our premier's office requesting suggestions as to how my almost 93-year-old mom is to get the H1N1 vaccine. It does not take a genius to know that many of our senior citizens are unable to wait in any lineups. Of course, I have not received a reply, due to the fact that I am asking for assistance, versus sending an e-mail filled with compliments. Shame on you and your government, Premier Stelmach. Is this how you would appreciate your mother being treated?</p>

<p>Who cares if the Flames got special treatment and had their H1N1 shots? They need to stay healthy so they can entertain us if and when we get the flu.</p>
<p>I say great--at least I'll have something decent to watch on television!</p>

<p>Re: "Flames are not to blame," Licia Corbella, Opinion, and VoxPop, "Was it wrong for the Flames to receive their flu shots last Friday? Yes, 67 per cent; No, 33 per cent," Nov. 6.</p>
<p>Interesting that the VoxPop results about the subject of Licia Corbella's excellent column show how Calgarians feel about the Flames benefiting from a private H1N1 clinic. Corbella's succinct and plausible explanation outlining the inevitable "fandemonium" had the Flames shown up at any of the clinics should have been top story news in all Calgary media from the beginning. Equally, her outlined timing of the Flames' inoculations takes the heat from any argument and off the Flames organization.</p>
<p>I am dismayed by those who loudly proclaim their disgust with the Flames, the NHL and hockey in general. Pity the child whose parent locked away his or her Flames jersey this week and forbids the mention of anything to do with hockey in the household. These are knee-jerk reactions that do not serve anyone, particularly our children. Better to channel your disgust with the way the H1N1 situation has been handled next time you are asked to exercise your right to vote.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 hasn't sidelined minor hockey players; Stampede clinic best for infants: health official</b>
</div><div>Jason Markusoff   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>

</p>
<p>Most minor hockey players haven't gotten the H1N1 vaccine like their professional Calgary heroes did, but so far the disease hasn't sidelined many of the skaters.</p>
<p>Amid the sweaty, high-impact environment they play in, hockey youngsters are being urged to take extra steps to avoid transmitting the fast-spreading flu, such as not sharing water bottles or towels.</p>
<p>In the season's first weeks, some children are staying home sick instead of playing --as leagues across Canada strongly recommend -- but not at higher rates than in past years, said Hockey Calgary's Perry Cavanagh.</p>
<p>"So far, knock on wood, everything has been typical," he said Saturday.</p>
<p>No players in Calgary's youth leagues have been reported as confirmed cases of H1N1, Cavanagh added.</p>
<p>Facing a supply shortage, Alberta is now only giving the vaccine to children between six months and five years old, as well as pregnant women. On Tuesday, children up to age 10 with chronic illnesses and parents or caregivers of infants younger than six months will also be eligible.</p>
<p>Uproar emerged last week that Calgary Flames players, their families and team officials had a VIP flu-shot clinic just before Alberta's all-comers vaccination policy ended in late October.</p>
<p>Team brass justified their request for special treatment in part by arguing their players had extra risk because of their frequent physical contact. However, public health officials say they determine highrisk based not on who's most likely to cont ra c t H1N1, but on who is most likely to become seriously ill from the flu strain.</p>
<p>Waits at Calgary's vaccine clinics were virtually non-existent Saturday, the third day of Alberta's limited-access inoculation policy. The lineup at the Avenida Tim Hortons was longer than the one at the Avenida Village clinic, a striking change from the seven-hour waits experienced there a week earlier.</p>
<p>"I was really surprised, after what I had seen all over the news," said Yad Brar, who waited in a chair only five minutes with his three-year-old daughter before getting her a shot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alberta Health Services revealed Saturday that it is encouraging parents and caregivers of infants to only go to the Stampede Grandstand clinic to get shots once they're eligible.</p>
<p>The hospital superboard's advertisements say "Stampede clinic only," although spokesman Don Stewart said eligible guardians won't be turned away from other open clinics.</p>
<p>But the board is directing them to the Stampede facility as a crowd-control measure, since it has the most capacity -- up to 100 nurse's stations, compared with 40 or fewer at the city's other five flu-shot clinics. Due to how it's set up, parents are least likely to be waiting outside at the Stampede site, especially important for ones who bring their newborns or infants with them, Stewart said.</p>
<p>The addition of new categories of flu-shot patients is expected to make clinics busier, but AHS is trying to minimize waits, and the Stampede recommendation is part of that strategy.</p>
<p>"We're hoping to avoid a situation where one site is overwhelmed, or another site is underutilized," Stewart said.</p>

</p>
<p>As Progressive Conservative delegates tucked into lunch Saturday at their Red Deer convention, about 700 people gathered outside to protest government cuts and hospital bed closures.</p>
<p>They waved banners, blew whistles and chanted, "No more cuts."</p>
<p>For them, the strong show of confidence by party members for Premier Ed Stelmach was beside the point.</p>
<p>"It was a message to the delegates that Albertans don't want to see Kleinstyle cuts in 2009," said David Eggen, the head of Friends of Medicare, who helped organize the protest.</p>
<p>Many of the protesters were union members from the United Nurses of Alberta and the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees.</p>
<p>Eggen said the high turnout was spurred in part by the government's response to the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>"People saw that as a test of the superboard, and it failed," Eggen said.</p>
<p>The coalition that organized the rally included seniors groups, advocates of the disabled, students and more. They came from as far away as Medicine Hat, Eggen said.</p>
<p>Jay Smith arrived from Edmonton to rail against what he said is privatization of health care in the province.</p>
<p>"I dislike the sharks in society, those who are predators," he said, motioning to the hotel hosting the convention.</p>
<p>The protesters marched around the outside of the hotel grounds before crossing the road and dissipating.</p>

<p>Re: "Expendable," (Letters, Nov. 3).</p>
<p>Norm Shacter is not a priority patient for early receipt of the H1N1 flu shot. He wonders if he is expendable in the eyes of government.</p>
<p>This perception underscores the problem of using the emotionally freighted terms "priority/non-priority patient" in our national swine-flu immunization campaign. It is unlikely that any Canadian self-identifies as a non-priority patient in any medical situation, let alone a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Public health officials should replace this socially divisive terminology with patient categories that are less demeaning, such as increased-vulnerability patient groups and reduced-vulnerability patient groups.</p>

<p>To the doctor who urged us all to get H1N1 shots: We'd love to trust science and our physician, we really would. We just don't trust your pals at Big Pharma, who appear to control both.</p>
<p>After decades of manufactured syndromes and convenient research, and doctors who behave more like pushers than healers, Big Pharma has ironically created a new malady: BPBSS, or Big Pharma BS Syndrome.</p>
<p>Sufferers understand that while BP legitimately saves lives, it couldn't resist a juicy bonanza like a flu pandemic. So yes, we hesitate, with the dilemma you gave us - is there really a wolf this time?</p>

</p>
<p>The regional health unit is investigating after players and staff at an Ontario Hockey Association team were inoculated against the H1N1 virus, even though some team members may not have classified as high risk.</p>
<p>"We definitely will be speaking to the physician who is responsible for it," Deb Bennett, director of health protection for the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit, said Saturday. "Everybody is aware of what the criteria are. I'm a little taken aback."</p>
<p>The LaSalle Vipers hockey team is not the first to receive flu shots ahead of members of the public who are supposed to receive priority.</p>
<p>Alberta's health authority has fired two people for involvement in giving Calgary Flames players and their families the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>It's part of what appears to be growing tensions over who is getting access to flu shots ahead of targeted priority groups.</p>
<p>There was fresh anger in Montreal on Friday when it was revealed wealthy Jewish General Hospital donors got H1N1 flu shots. A spokeswoman for the hospital said all 200 donors who received H1N1 shots serve as volunteers in some capacity.</p>
<p>That followed the revelation that board members of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital were offered H1N1 flu shots. A statement from the hospital said the vaccinations were given during a clinic that was open to the general public during a time where no shortages had been announced.</p>
<p>In Windsor, Vipers spokeswoman Gail Robertson confirmed that players, staff and some volunteers with the Junior B men's team received H1N1 vaccinations last week at a regular team practice.</p>
<p>She said management went ahead with the vaccinations, in consultation with team medical advisers, because one of the players contracted the flu in October.</p>
<p>Bennett, however, said the health unit distributed the vaccines, for which people have been standing in long lineups, to physicians on the understanding the Ontario Health Ministry's guidelines of vaccinating people on a priority basis were followed.</p>
<p>The shots began a couple of weeks ago and were to be administered on a priority basis, starting with the most at-risk groups.</p>

</div><div>Kate Jaimet   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>787 words</div><div>8 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>With dozens of nurses, obstetricians, anesthesiologists, and pediatricians on volunteer duty at the Ottawa Hospital's Riverside campus Saturday, the H1N1 vaccine clinic for pregnant women was ready to take anything in stride -- even the surprise arrival of a baby.</p>
<p>"We fully expect we could have some (women) who are one or two weeks before delivery," said Dr. Jim Worthington, vice-president of medical affairs with The Ottawa Hospital, as he stood watching the steady stream of pregnant women arrive. "There isn't too much, medically or clinically, that we can't manage." No babies were born, but by mid-morning about 700 people had been vaccinated at the one-day clinic that had a capacity to inoculate 5,500 people.</p>
<p>And though women are often cautious about any kind of medical intervention during pregnancy, obstetrician Dr. Jessica Dy, one of the volunteers staffing the clinic, was pleased to see many of them taking the opportunity to get the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>"It's always a balance of risks, and we know that vaccine is safe in pregnancy, and we also know if you get the H1N1 flu, pregnant women can get much sicker than the average person," she said.</p>
<p>"It's much harder to treat a sick pregnant women, because you don't have one patient, you have two patients." A lineup of about 100 people had formed by 7:30 a.m. for the clinic that opened at 7:45, about 15 minutes ahead of schedule. The pregnant women and their families were not forced to wait outside, but were welcomed instead into the hospital's foyer.</p>
<p>Soon the backlog had cleared and as of mid-morning a steady stream of women and their families were being registered and vaccinated with little or no wait time. By later in the day Saturday, the clinic was made available to anyone from the high priority groups for the vaccine.</p>
<p>"We haven't had a lineup all day," said Cameron Love, the Ottawa Hospital's vice-president of planning and support services.</p>
<p>The Riverside had 40 vaccination stations, 2,000 doses of unadjuvanted vaccine and 3,500 doses of the adjuvanted variety, said Worthington.</p>
<p>Pregnant women were welcome to bring their spouses and children for the shot, since protecting the entire family against the H1N1 virus helps to protect the newborn baby.</p>
<p>Clinics for pregnant women were also held at the Montfort and Queensway-Carleton hospitals Saturday. Ottawa Hospital spokeswoman Allison Neill said 800 pregnant women were vaccinated at all three sites during the day.</p>
<p>Worthington said the vaccine is important for pregnant women, since, although they are not more likely to catch the flu than anyone else, if they do catch it they are five times more likely to be hospitalized and three times more likely to have complications than the general population.</p>
<p>And while many women have built up an immunity to the common, seasonal flu, the H1N1 is a new strain against which most people are not immune.</p>
<p>"Some of the protectiveness of the vaccine spreads to the infants (in the womb)," Worthington added. "The infants will have some degree of immunity." Melissa Cutler, 31, took advantage of the clinic to get the vaccine for herself and her two sons, aged two and four. She said at first she was hesitant about the shot, as were many of her pregnant friends.</p>
<p>"I've never had the flu shot, and I probably never will again. And if I wasn't pregnant, I probably wouldn't get it either," she said.</p>
<p>But the option of receiving non-adjuvanted vaccine eased some of her anxieties, and the widely reported deaths of two Ontario youngsters last month -- 10-year-old Vanetia Warner and 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio -- finally made up her mind.</p>
<p>"I think it was when the two younger children passed away. And there was a confirmed case of H1N1 at his daycare," she said, motioning to her two-year-old son, Linden.</p>
<p>"And then when they were doing this clinic, I thought: Ahh, no lineup."</p>

because if they catch the virus they are five times more likely to
be hospitalized.

<div id="hd"><b>FLU MAGNET; Pearson airport is a case study in a reality of our times: The link between air travel and disease</b>
</div><div>Kenneth Kidd   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>2034 words</div><div>8 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Passengers are streaming through the glass doors and into the muted light of the public hall at Pearson's Terminal One. Some march, almost head down, toward the exits and waiting limousines. Others linger, searching for loved ones among the welcoming crowd.</p>
<p>Nearly everyone sports the universal airport face, that strange, half-asleep look of apprehension, as if they're inhabiting some kind of in-between world, suspended.</p>
<p>Above them, a giant electronic board lists the scheduled arrivals of planes from Amritsar, London, Houston, Frankfurt ... the list goes on.</p>
<p>As Toronto struggles through H1N1 influenza amid shortages of vaccine, it is here, at the international arrival gates of Pearson, that every subsequent pandemic will also arrive, borne from every imaginable corner of the planet.</p>
<p>By one estimate, Toronto is the third most vulnerable city in North America, surpassed only by New York and Los Angeles in its potential exposure to diseases that develop elsewhere and quickly travel the world's airlines, unseen.</p>
<p>Many of those disembarking at this point in the afternoon have arrived on Etihad Flight 141 from Abu Dhabi, but that's only the last leg of their journey. Kelly Surette and Kane Riley-Henderson started theirs 30 hours earlier in Sydney. Neelima Dahata began hers 22 hours earlier, in New Delhi.</p>
<p>It's those types of trips that set Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease specialist at St. Michael's Hospital, on another kind of voyage five years ago, in the wake of SARS.</p>
<p>That disease follows humans might seem obvious, but Khan dreamed of a loftier construction.</p>
<p>More than 2 billion passengers shuttle between 3,500 international airports each year.</p>
<p>Could an intricate knowledge of their travel patterns allow him and his colleagues to predict how and when an emerging disease would reach Toronto?</p>
<p>And could that information help contain the spread of disease?</p>
<p>Doing graduate work in New York, Khan had watched the arrival of West Nile disease first-hand. He was there for the anthrax scare, too, and when he returned to Toronto, it was just in time for SARS, the virus that killed 44 people.</p>
<p>"It was very clear what an emerging epidemic could do to a city and a country," says Khan. "I think it was always understood that this could happen, it's just that this was right in our face."</p>
<p>He remembers looking at maps showing where new cases were arising, and realizing that a kind of social networking was at play, as if international airports had their own group on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p>Or, as Khan puts it: "Pearson knows Reagan knows JFK knows Charles de Gaulle."</p>
<p>Academics have long been interested in the relationship between air travel and disease, but Khan wanted to develop a tool that could help handle real-time outbreaks of disease and pandemics. "We can't stop air travel, but we can try to understand it."</p>
<p>The result was the Bio.Diaspora project, centred at St. Michael's, beginning in early 2004. It would grow to include 11 other academics, with specialties ranging from geography to mathematics, and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring detailed flight data from the world's airline industry.</p>
<p>Pearson is by far Canada's busiest airport. Last year, 32.3 million passengers passed through it - including just under 10 million international travellers, more than Montreal and Vancouver combined.</p>
<p>But as Khan's project gathered steam, it was Pearson's central position in the architecture of world travel - where and how people move - that really started to stand out.</p>
<p>With 133 direct connections to cities outside the country last year, Pearson would rank 17th in the world, well behind London, with 362.</p>
<p>Flights between cities in the European Union, however, are effectively domestic. If you remove those from the equation, Toronto moves up to eighth in the world, just slightly behind New York, the only other North American city among the top 10.</p>
<p>Another measure Khan's group studied was "closeness" - how accessible a city is to all other cities, based on calculations around flight times and passenger loads.</p>
<p>Last year, Toronto ranked ninth in the world.</p>
<p>Calibrating those and other measures, Khan argues that Pearson is the third most vulnerable city in North America, after New York and Los Angeles, even though Miami receives more international passengers.</p>
<p>That's because Miami's international exposure is so heavily skewed to the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Pearson's central place in the global network shone through when Khan's group starting running simulations, tracking how a disease that emerged in, say, Cairo or Hong Kong, could be expected to travel the world in a first wave of 21 days.</p>
<p>"Our system has been developed with sufficient ability that you could call me and say, 'There's something happening in this city of the world today,' and we could look at that location and come up with a prediction of where (the disease) is likely to go and where it's unlikely to go in the first wave," says Khan.</p>
<p>A range of other factors could still temper the spread, including the specific nature of the disease and how effective the local response has been in the originating city or region.</p>
<p>But "once the cat's out of the bag, then we can start making some reasonably good predictions about where it's going to go and when," says Khan.</p>
<p>And in any disease outbreak, forewarned can mean forearmed.</p>
<p>In the bowels of the <span class="companylink">Greater Toronto Airports Authority</span> building at Pearson is a large, grey-walled room. A massive wooden table dominates, with 14 chairs around it, the table lined with telephone consoles, each with a microphone on a long stem.</p>
<p>It's here, in the Emergency Operations Centre, that the sundry parts of the Pearson community met daily during the first two weeks of H1N1's arrival in the spring, and it's here they'll inevitably meet for the next pandemic.</p>
<p>To travellers, Pearson may seem like a single entity, but it's a many-headed beast.</p>
<p>The GTAA is a federal body, hospitals and ambulance services are provincial, while off-site firefighters are local, hailing from both Toronto and Peel Region.</p>
<p>Then there's the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency, both federal, and the private-sector airlines and concessionaires, among others.</p>
<p>As manager of emergency management systems at the GTAA, it's Deane Johanis's job to ensure that everything's in place for all those players to move in coordinated fashion in a crisis.</p>
<p>"Our role is really one of bringing all the parties together and making sure there's an information flow," says Johanis.</p>
<p>Last month, for instance, the GTAA brought together 90 people from Pearson's extended community and had them work through various scenarios. What would happen, for instance, if 30 per cent of your staff booked off sick?</p>
<p>"If there's nobody at customs counters to screen people, that would bring the whole thing to a screeching halt," says Johanis. "We were trying to make sure that those critical points continue to be resourced and that there are contingencies in place."</p>
<p>In the wake of SARS, she notes, much has changed. The Public Health Agency, for instance, was specifically created to handle those sorts of threats, and the public health officer for eastern Canada is stationed at Pearson.</p>
<p>The Quarantine Act, virtually untouched since the arrival of air travel, was revised to give quarantine officers sweeping powers, including the ability to summon police assistance.</p>
<p>Depending on what symptoms a passenger shows, a quarantine officer is now automatically dispatched along with the airport's regular medical crew.</p>
<p>"They can evaluate whether there's a public health risk, right from the beginning," says Johanis.</p>
<p>The spectrum of responses can be broad, depending on the specific disease and how widespread it has become.</p>
<p>"The strategy in a limited, focused outbreak, as with SARS, is vastly different than in a general outbreak, where the barn doors are open anyway," she says.</p>
<p>The latter quickly became the case with H1N1, so one response was giving all travellers headed to Mexico a health alert that described the influenza and its symptoms. It also advised travellers to avoid sick people while in Mexico and to seek medical help immediately if they developed a fever and cough.</p>
<p>But in the case of a more virulent yet limited threat, an entire aircraft and its passengers can now be quickly placed in quarantine under the post-SARS regime.</p>
<p>In April, Khan was at the Four Seasons Centre for a performance of Simon Boccanegra, Giuseppe Verdi's sweeping tale of death and deception, when his cellphone started to vibrate during intermission.</p>
<p>On the other end of the line was Michael Gardam, the infectious disease specialist at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion and another member of the Bio.Diaspora team.</p>
<p>At that point, there were cases of H1N1 in Mexico and the Mexicans were sending viral samples to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for testing. The Bio.Diaspora group, then finalizing a major report on its work, now had an actual outbreak to work on, in real time.</p>
<p>By the next day they were churning out their first bits of analysis and responding to queries from federal and provincial health authorities.</p>
<p>"This couldn't be an academic thing," says Khan, "We needed to be able to generate information in less than 24 hours."</p>
<p>Looking at travel data from the previous March and April, his group found that during that period 2.35 million people flew from Mexico to 1,018 cities in 164 countries. So this was big, not something easily contained.</p>
<p>Among the questions: How many of those coming to Canada do so on direct flights?</p>
<p>It turns out only 87 per cent do; the rest make connections, most often at airports in Texas.</p>
<p>Knowing those sorts of facts can help local health authorities make more informed decisions about how to marshal finite resources. Do you concentrate on that 87 per cent? What would it take to try covering the other 13 per cent?</p>
<p>"What we provide is risk stratification," says Khan.</p>
<p>"If we know of an epidemic in a particular place, (we can identify) which cities and countries need to be on a very heightened alert, and which places should be monitoring the situation but don't necessarily need to pull the trigger and start mobilizing their resources at that particular moment."</p>
<p>Khan's group later calculated that, among countries receiving more than 1,400 passengers from Mexico in that two-month period, flight patterns alone were more than 90 per cent effective in predicting where H1N1 would land.</p>
<p>That's why the Bio.Diaspora group has lately been working with the government of Saudi Arabia, since roughly 2.5 million pilgrims will be making their way to Mecca later this month.</p>
<p>"We looked in extreme detail at where all the pilgrims came from last year," says Khan.</p>
<p>While most hailed from other Middle Eastern countries, huge contingents also landed from Pakistan, India and Indonesia. Only 3,500 went from Canada.</p>
<p>Apart from an unexpected outbreak of something new, the main concern is that a good many pilgrims will then return home to parts of the world that have, so far, been relatively untouched by H1N1, such as sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>"The last frontiers for H1N1 are places that are not well connected, and these tend to be poor countries," says Khan.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's the poorer parts of the planet that often lack the resources to mount vigorous campaigns against any disease.</p>
<p>And until that changes, note Khan, we'll remain far from the "perfect world" in which "outbreaks would be dealt with effectively at their source." PEARSON continued on a8 PEARSON from a1</p>

<p>Give flu shots in schools, Editorial,</p>
<p>Nov. 6</p>
<p>I echo the Star editorial that H1N1 flu shots should be administered in local schools across the city and province. For years discussions and debates at school boards have revolved around the importance of the local school as a hub for the community. We routinely ask for parental permission for kids to go on class trips, to get their pictures taken and for report cards. I am sure most parents would jump at the chance to have H1N1 vaccinations at their local school.</p>

<p>STORM CLOSES IN ON CANCUN</p>
<p>CANCUN, Mexico -- Officials readied storm shelters along Mexico's Caribbean coast Saturday and told fishermen and tour operators to pull in boats amid warnings that Tropical Storm Ida could become a hurricane as it neared the resort city of Cancun.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said Ida's winds strengthened to near 110 km/h, just short of a Category 1 hurricane.</p>
<p>Ida's forecast track moved slightly toward the north, on a path that would take it through the Yucatan Channel that separates Mexico and Cuba around midday Sunday. Forecasters predicted Ida would weaken and enter the Gulf of Mexico and possibly brush the U.S. Gulf Coast next week.</p>
<p>SAUDIS PREP FOR HAJJ, H1n1</p>
<p>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- The Saudi health minister said that the kingdom will not bar anyone considered high-risk for H1N1 flu from performing the hajj pilgrimage this year, though he urged countries where pilgrims set out from to take precautions.</p>
<p>The hajj, required of all able-bodied Muslims at least once in their lifetime, has become a concern for world health officials because the density of pilgrims has raised fears of a spread of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The pilgrimage attracts about 3 million people from 160 countries annually and begins this year on Nov. 25, as the winter flu season approaches in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Maintain financial aid: G20</p>
<p>FINANCE officials from rich and developing countries have pledged to maintain emergency support for their economies until recovery is assured, but failed to reach a clear agreement to bear the cost of fighting climate change.</p>
<p>There was also a mixed reaction among the Group of 20 leading rich and emerging nations Saturday in St. Andrews, Scotland, to a British-led push to consider a fund for bank bailouts, possibly financed by a tax on financial transactions, to ensure that taxpayers don't bear the brunt of any future rescues.</p>
<p>NATO PROBES AIR STRIKE</p>
<p>KABUL, Afghanistan -- U.S. and Afghan authorities are investigating whether a botched NATO air strike was to blame for the death of Afghan soldiers and police during a search for two American paratroopers missing in the country's western region.</p>
<p>The probe into a possible friendly-fire incident further aggravates already strained relations between Afghan President Hamid Karzai and the international community, which holds his enfeebled government partly responsible for rising instability.</p>
<p>DOMINOES REPLACE WALL</p>

<p>DALLAS -- Steve Bernier was in a sweat Saturday for all the right reasons.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Canucks winger was spotted in the gym after recovering from a mild case of the flu and put to rest fears that he had contracted a more serious strain when the club embarked on its five-game road trip Wednesday.</p>
<p>"I feel a lot better," said Bernier, who plans to practise today. "I was pretty worried on the plane coming down from Vancouver, but it was only a mild flu for about 48 hours."</p>
<p>Regardless, Bernier didn't fly on the team's post-game charter Thursday night following a 5-2 win at</p>
<p>St. Paul, Minn. He flew into Dallas on Friday and has had his own hotel room because of league-wide concern over the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"He's improving dramatically," said Canucks GM Mike Gillis. "We'll keep him away from the team until he's over the transmission period."</p>
<p>The Canucks had considered getting H1N1 vaccine shots while in Texas, but Gillis said because of high demand in Dallas among those most susceptible to the swine flu, the team will wait until it returns home on Nov. 14 to get the shots.</p>
<p>"We checked into it, but it's the same situation as back in Canada," he said. "There's a shortage here and it's on a high-priority-need basis. We thought in the event there was extra vaccine or if we had an opportunity to do it in the U.S., we would, and we did check it out."</p>
<p>Gillis also stressed that the Canucks won't jump any cues to get their players the vaccine.</p>
<p>"Absolutely not," said Gillis.</p>
<p>David Krejci of the Boston Bruins is the latest to be diagnosed with the H1N1 virus. Four others NHL players have had it, too.</p>

<p>Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach faced a party vote Saturday night that could determine his political future.</p>
<p>Members of Stelmach's governing Progressive Conservatives were voting to determine if a leadership convention should be called.</p>
<p>The test of Stelmach's support within his own party comes as the man known as "Steady Eddie" faces the greatest adversity of his premier- ship.</p>
<p>His party's popular support is sitting at a 16-year low, and public discontent has been growing over such issues as the province's H1N1 flu vaccinations, its politicians' pay and the effects of the new resource royalty framework.</p>
<p>Former premier Ralph Klein has said Stelmach needs at least 70-per-cent support from party members to stay.</p>
<p>Klein himself stepped down after winning 55-per-cent support at a convention in 2006.</p>
<p>But Stelmach did not say what show of support he needs to stay in the job.</p>
<p>Stelmach's ministers insist rumours of trouble for Stelmach are little more than media hype.</p>
<p>Just 20 months ago, Stelmach delivered the biggest majority of any first-time Alberta premier when he led his Progressive Conservatives to a dominating provincial election performance that saw them take 72 of 83 seats in the legislature.</p>
<p>In the past month, three different polls showed public support for the Tories slipping as interest grew in the upstart right-wing Wildrose Alliance party.</p>
<p>In September, the Liberal opposition's Paul Hinman pulled off a surprise byelection victory in Calgary after running a campaign with the slogan: "Send Ed a message." --</p>

<p>RED DEER -- Premier Ed Stelmach collected 77.4-per-cent support from his own party members, despite weeks of speculation he could fare poorly.</p>
<p>Progressive Conservatives counted 1,191 ballots Saturday, with 922 voting against starting a new leadership race.</p>
<p>"We have a very big-tent party, it's a democratic party, it's open, it's inclusive and I know that with such a large tent, a large party, there will be a variety of opinions," Stelmach said.</p>
<p>"Yes, [I'm] listening very closely, changes will be coming but they will be done in due course."</p>
<p>The week leading up to Stelmach's leadership review was marked by criticism of the government's handling of H1N1 vaccination clinics, poor poll numbers for the Progressive Conservatives and rumours the premier could fare poorly among party members.</p>
<p>About 1,400 Tories met at the Capri Hotel in Red Deer over the weekend for their annual general meeting.</p>
<p>Party rules demand a new leadership contest start if 50.1 per cent of the delegates asked for it.</p>
<p>While some watching the leadership review said low support figures for Stelmach would have looked like the party was in panic mode, a good figure could point to a party that has gone too far from real people.</p>
<p>"It could have the effect of making regular Albertans feel like they are out of touch," pollster Bruce Cameron said Thursday.</p>
<p>Cameron's poll last month was one of three that showed public support for the Tories is sinking, while Danielle Smith's Wildrose Alliance improves.</p>
<p>But Aboriginal Relations Minister Gene Zwozdesky said the weekend was one of rejuvenation for the party.</p>
<p>"This party has been galvanized around itself and around the leader," Zwozdesky said.</p>

<p>Members of the B.C. legislature pushed through a bill ending the B.C ambulance paramedics strike after a gruelling 13-hour session that started Friday and ended Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Government House Leader Mike de Jong had warned that MLAs would sit through the weekend, if necessary, to ensure Bill 21 was in place by Monday.</p>
<p>The government argued that the strike, which began in April, was becoming a risk to public health, with the ongoing danger of the H1N1 virus and the approach of winter.</p>
<p>But CUPE maintained the legislation was spurred by requests from the Vancouver Olympic organizing committee to the Health Ministry.</p>
<p>Paramedics had still been working during the strike under an essential-services order from the government.</p>
<p>The province moved to legislate the 3,500 paramedics back to work with less than a month to go in the current legislative session -- the last regular sitting of the house before the 2010 Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>The settlement outlined in the Ambulance Service Collective Agreement Act reflected the offer made to the union in September. The one-year deal is retroactive to April 1, and includes a pay hike of three per cent.</p>
<p>In September, the president of CUPE Local 873 -- the union representing the paramedics -- called the company's contract offer "woefully short of reasonable expectations."</p>

<p>The Canucks have gone up even higher in my estimation. Never mind their play, they have the honour and fairness not to push children and veterans out of the lineup for the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>There was a time when no one in sports would push ahead of children and the vulnerable.</p>
<p>Teams who lose players to flu and then have to play queue-jumpers should be able to have the game deferred until all their players are healthy again.</p>

<div>382 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>F17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>in which employees work from home while staying in touch with the office via telephone, email and other forms of communication - is far from a new concept, yet people haven't taken it up in nearly the numbers that telework's proponents think they should.</p>
<p>A catalyst like a severe outbreak of H1N1 could force the issue, however, as employers could find themselves relying on telework programs to keep their business running in a time of crisis, said Bob Klay of Klay Information Management Consulting Ltd.</p>
<p>Telework could help maintain business continuity in many situations, be it a reduced workforce due to illness or unforeseen events like the loss of a building or loss of IT, Klay said.</p>
<p>"You need to be prepared to really protect your business. Individuals are easy to change, relatively speaking. It's the business that has a hard time to change," he said.</p>
<p>Peter Tertzakian, chief energy economist of ARC Financial Corp. and bestselling author, said he views telework as a part of a broader societal change.</p>
<p>More broadly, it's about a changing society as it relates to technology and energy.</p>
<p>Telework could help change the current North American lifestyle, which has been defined by energy.</p>
<p>It's a model that sees people "driving in to a central core like a herd of cattle first thing in the morning . . . and then doing the same thing at the end of the day when you only interact with five or six people," Tertzakian said.</p>
<p>Change could be brought about by many reasons. One of them is the high price of gasoline.</p>
<p>Tertzakian said the trigger point is around $80 to $85 per barrel of oil.</p>
<p>The price recently crossed $80 for the first time in over a year.</p>
<p>"There's no question that high energy prices are going to be a catalyst, particularly high oil prices, and I believe we're looking at the trigger point right in the face right now," he said.</p>
<p>Telework will also need to be a compelling proposition for corporations before it will be fully adopted, or perhaps even require a marshalling event to encourage more widespread adoption.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Jewish General inoculates its top 200 donors; They're all volunteers: hospital. But Quebec insists you don't get a shot unless you give care directly to patients</b>
</div><div>AARON DERFEL    </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>697 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>As thousands of Montreal adults wait anxiously to get their H1N1 flu shots next month, the top 200 donors to the Jewish General Hospital have already been inoculated, The Gazette has learned.</p>
<p>Hospital officials, however, denied that there's a link between making a financial donation and getting fast-tracked for the flu shots. Rather, the 200 donors are all volunteers at the Jewish General in some capacity, spokesperson Karen Ohayon said.</p>
<p>"It has nothing to do with the fact that they gave money," she said.</p>
<p>"There's absolutely no link." Last month, the Quebec government announced that health-care workers - including doctors, nurses and other staff who are in close contact with patients - would be the first to be vaccinated against the pandemic H1N1 strain.</p>
<p>However, the Jewish General has decided that in addition to health professionals, donors who sit on various boards would also be vaccinated.</p>
<p>"Most of the people that donate to the hospital in one way or another volunteer at the hospital, because they are all part of boards and are involved in the hospital," Ohayon explained.</p>
<p>"They are inside the hospital, they give their time. They are inside meetings. They are part of the hospital in a way, because they are always here." Asked whether a donor- volunteer of the Jewish General foundation is in close contact with patients, Ohayon responded: "Yes, because there is contact. I work for the PR department, which is next to the entrance, and I'm in the hospital almost all day and I was vaccinated. We're exposed to the virus." However, a physician who works at a Montreal hospital accused the Jewish General of applying a double standard to favour "elite donors." "That's disgusting," said the doctor, who spoke on condition that her name not be used. "Where are the priorities in our society? Are sports figures and elite donors a priority?" The physician was alluding to a report this week that a British Columbia doctor had vaccinated 22 pro hockey players. B.C.'s health officer responded immediately, saying the shortage of vaccine means that athletes should not have jumped the queue.</p>
<p>Marie-Ève Bédard, press attaché to Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc, said board members of hospitals and donors are not entitled to vaccines ahead of the rest of the population.</p>
<p>"There has been a gap in communication because this morning we learned that certain (hospital) boards of directors were vaccinated, which the minister considers unacceptable," Bédard said.</p>
<p>"Whether they are donors or volunteers, unless they give care directly to patients, they should not have been vaccinated" as part of the first-priority group.</p>
<p>"Perhaps some institutions have taken their own initiatives, but they were never authorized by the Health Department," Bédard added.</p>
<p>The Montreal hospital physician was also upset by the government policy of vaccinating health-care workers last week but not their children.</p>
<p>"We find it despicable that the Health Ministry did not vaccinate health-care workers' children in the hospital," she said. "Instead, we now have to take a full day off work to get our children vaccinated."</p>

</p>
<p>Board members of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital were offered H1N1 flu shots at a board of governors meeting Oct. 26, says the union representing 46,000 health-care workers in Ontario.</p>
<p>"The message this is sending is that the wealthy and influential should be treated first," said Pat Chastang, a spokesperson for the Service Employees International Union Local 1 Canada, "even if it means pregnant women and children must be made to wait."</p>
<p>The Ontario union urged all 65 of Mount Sinai's board members to resign.</p>
<p>"The most important quality of a board member are their ethics and their integrity. Clearly, jumping the queue was a mistake," Chastang said.</p>
<p>A statement from the hospital said the vaccinations were given during a clinic that was open to the general public at a time when no shortages had been announced.</p>
<p>The revelations come as the World Health Organization warned "intense and persistent" flu transmission continues to be reported in North America, "without evidence of a peak in activity."</p>
<p>This week, Canada's death toll reached more than 100 since the beginning of the pandemic in late April. As of Thursday, 115 deaths due to H1N1 had been reported to the federal government. The number of new hospitalizations were more than three times higher than the previous week, and 737 new flu outbreaks were reported - 710 of them in schools.</p>
<p>Virtually all flu cases diagnosed in Canada - 99.7 per cent - are H1N1.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada had received reports by Oct. 31 of 2,440 hospitalized cases, including 443 admitted to intensive care and 230 that required mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p>In its weekly situation update yesterday, WHO said rates of influenza-like illness, the proportion of respiratory samples testing positive for flu, and outbreaks in schools "continues to increase sharply in Canada as activity spreads eastward."</p>
<p>Across Canada and the U.S., flu rates are higher than normal for this time of year.</p>
<p>Significantly more cases of H1N1 have been recorded in Mexico since September than were seen during the initial outbreak of H1N1 in the spring.</p>
<p>"Everything we are seeing is the 2009 H1N1 virus," said Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the U.S. National Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The jury's still out on booster shots; Quebec recommending two doses for children as it awaits more studies</b>
</div><div>AARON DERFEL    </div>

<div>457 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>Confusion reigned in provincial government circles yesterday about whether to recommend giving children a second booster shot to protect against the deadly H1N1 flu strain.</p>
<p>At first, Quebec public-health officials recommended that children from the ages of 6 months to 5 years be given two half-doses administered at least 21 days apart.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, however, Quebec's chief public health officer said children should require only a single half-dose of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Alain Poirier told CBC Radio that researchers in Quebec had tested 150 children who had been vaccinated only once and found that "100 per cent of them had the right level of antibodies." On Thursday, thousands of children in Montreal were vaccinated. Some parents were told the single dose was enough, while others were advised to wait for the second booster shot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Public Health Agency of Canada continues to recommend two half-doses for children. And <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, the Quebec City-based manufacturer of the vaccine, also recommends two shots for children age 6 months to 9 years.</p>
<p>A nurse contacted The Gazette yesterday saying that "as per protocol ... there is not a scheduled booster shot for kids under 6 (years old) at this time." "There will be a government evaluation in three weeks to monitor incidence in that age group and act consequently." But Marie-Ève Bédard, press attaché to Health Minister Yves Bolduc, said the government is still recommending two doses.</p>
<p>"There are studies that have shown that a single dose will confer 100-per-cent immunity," Bédard said. "This research is not enough to be conclusive - there are other studies that are being carried out.</p>
<p>"So for the moment, we are recommending two half-doses." Bédard added the government will probably hold a news conference in the coming days to clear up the matter.</p>
<p>Traditionally, most children are given two flu shots because their immune systems are not fully developed.</p>
<p>Karl Weiss, an infectious-diseases expert at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, said that he believes one dose will be enough for most children.</p>
<p>"If we have the data from the 150 kids (who were studied), I would say that's good," he said.</p>
<p>"That shouldn't be a problem with healthy kids.</p>
<p>"It's just the little ones, 6 months to 2 years old, did they have enough of these children in that study to make that recommendation?" Bédard denied suggestions the government has been improvising in its vaccination campaign to make up for an apparent shortage of the vaccine.</p>
<p>"There is a sufficient amount of vaccine to give two doses to children," she said.</p>

</div><div>Richard Warnica   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>631 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>(From Edmonton Journal, November 11, 2009) An A1 story Saturday should have said Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission employees would be asked to sign statutory declarations if they missed more than two consecutive days of work due to illness during the flu pandemic.***** </p>
<p>Alberta government employees will be asked to swear oaths declaring they were sick if they miss work during the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>Employees were told this week they would need the statutory declarations, sworn in front of a commissioner of oaths, if they are absent more than three consecutive days.</p>
<p>The policy is meant to ease the pressure on family doctors by removing the need for medical notes during the outbreak, government spokesman Gerald Kastendieck said.</p>
<p>"It's not something they need to do the minute they come back or anything," said Kastendieck, who works in corporate human resources.</p>
<p>"They can go to their HR person, say, 'OK, I was away for however many days beyond the three, how do I get this addressed?'"</p>
<p>Kastendieck said most government agencies have commissioners of oaths working for them already. No employees will be asked to pay to have their declaration done.</p>
<p>"The idea is not that your supervisor doesn't believe you or anything like that," he said.</p>
<p>There are 28,000 provincial employees. The policy was adopted after Alberta's Chief Medical Officer asked employers to relax their rules on doctors' notes during the pandemic.</p>
<p>In response, some organizations, such as the University of Alberta, have waved the requirement altogether.</p>
<p>"We are going on the honour system with our employees," university spokeswoman Bev Betkowski said. "No doctor's note or any other paperwork is required."</p>
<p>The same applies at the Workers' Compensation Board, which would normally require a doctor's note from employees absent longer than five days.</p>
<p>"With the flu, this year in particular, our larger concern is that they stay home, protect and care for themselves, and return healthy when they are better," spokeswoman Jennifer Dagsvik said.</p>
<p>Others organizations, such as the City of Edmonton, have eased their rules, expanding the number of days employees can miss without a note, but not eliminating the requirement entirely.</p>
<p>More than five days</p>
<p>"Generally, now they're only required if a person is off more than five working days," city official David Doyle said.</p>
<p>"We believe that if you're that ill for that long, you should probably be going to see your doctor anyway. But in the other situations where we used to require a sick note, we've said no, not anymore, not for now anyway."</p>
<p>In the schools, parents of sick children have not been asked for notes or any other proof of illness beyond a courtesy call, said both the Catholic and public boards.</p>
<p>Teachers in the public system don't need notes either, said Jane Sterling, a spokeswoman for the board. The Catholic board plans to meet next week to review its policy for teachers.</p>
<p>At the Gaming and Liquor Commission, a government body, two employees have already sworn the sickness oath, spokeswoman Vanda Killeen said.</p>
<p>She said copies of the policy were posted in the commission's St. Albert head office this week.</p>
<p>Employees there would normally be asked for a sick note after missing two days of work. The same now applies for the declaration, Killeen said.</p>
<p>With scores of certified commissioners of oaths on the commission's payroll, Killeen doesn't think commission employees will have a problem finding someone to sign the form.</p>
<p>"There's probably several on every floor of the building and some in Calgary, too."</p>

<p>A second person has been fired by Alberta's health authority for involvement in giving Calgary Flames players and their families the H1N1 vaccine last week.</p>
<p>A statement made public yesterday by Alberta Health Services detailed how the hockey players got their shots without having to stand in hours-long lineups with other members of the public.</p>
<p>"A Calgary Flames medical representative approached Alberta Health Services on Oct. 27 through a staff member to see if an H1N1 immunization clinic would be made available to the Flames and their families," the statement reads.</p>
<p>Oct. 27 was the second day the vaccination was available to everyone in Alberta. "The request was forwarded to a more senior AHS staff member who in turn took it to a supervisor, and the request was approved."</p>
<p>The clinic for the players and their families was held on Oct. 30 at Father David Bauer Arena in Calgary, one day before the province closed the doors of all mass immunization clinics because of huge public demand and a vaccine shortage.</p>
<p>"There is no written record of approval to proceed and there is no process for authorization of the use of the H1N1 vaccine for this purpose, as it contradicts existing protocols and processes," the statement said. "Use of the vaccine was not discussed or authorized above the level of the individual who authorized its use."</p>
<p>The name of the most senior staff member involved, who was dismissed earlier this week, has not been released.</p>
<p>The investigation is complete and no further disciplinary action is being considered.</p>

</p>
<p>Standing in line for an H1N1 vaccination yesterday morning, an elderly woman was reading the front page headline in her Gazette: "Montrealers get in line."</p>
<p>This line was at the métro level of Alexis Nihon Plaza. It moved very smartly. It was extremely well organized. Everyone involved, from the health-care workers to the people running the queue, knew what their jobs were and did them in a highly efficient and friendly manner. They had even hired a clown to entertain the kids in line.</p>
<p>And there were lots of kids, from babes in arms to toddlers in strollers, as well as their parents, on the second day of this clinic run by the Quebec government's Montreal Health and Social Services Agency. It's one of 15 sites on the island of Montreal, and by next week there will be five more, including one at the Olympic Stadium.</p>
<p>The mood of the people in line was calm and good-humoured, not a lot different than a queue for a children's movie matinee, or for that matter DisneyWorld, the evident model for giving out coupons with times written on them. There was no jostling, no shoving, and no queue-jumping. Canadians are conditioned from birth to stand in line. Above all, there was no sign of panic or even anxiety. Parents mixed easily, comparing their H1N1 mental preparation notes back and forth in both official languages.</p>
<p>Best of all, they were not lined up in the cold, catching air-borne germs from hundreds of others. It was all indoors, and from the time anyone joined the line, it took only 45 minutes to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>The first thing people in the line received was a note from the doctor, Richard Lessard, head of the health agency, "to inform you that new priority groups have been chosen for Montreal," asking citizens to respect them. On the other side of the one-page letter, available in either language, he explained which groups would be vaccinated first, and why. First, children, 6 months to 5 years. Then, parents and siblings of infants younger than 6 months. Then, women 20 weeks pregnant or more, and persons with chronic medical conditions, such as asthma or diabetes.</p>
<p>Although I'm in a low-risk demographic, I was able to join the line as the parent of an infant under 6 months of age. Zara is 4 months old and lives with her mother at her grandparents' home in Whitby, Ont. She is the picture of good health, but like mothers of all infants under 6 months of age, her mom is understandably determined to avoid exposure to anyone who hasn't been vaccinated, at least until the baby can be.</p>
<p>It took a little explaining at the registration desk, and it definitely helped that I had a photo-copy of her birth certificate, as well as her SIN and Ontario health cards. Not to mention baby pictures. But they were very sympathetic and understanding.</p>
<p>When the clerk punches in the number of your Quebec health card, the computer automatically generates a form with your name, address, postal code and phone number, and all you need to do is attest that you understand the caveats, and hand it off to the "verification desk," before being vaccinated.</p>
<p>And that's the quickest part of the whole process, taking no more time than it does to roll up your sleeve. Then, they ask you to take 15 minutes in a waiting room, to make sure you're not having a bad reaction to the shot. Total elapsed time, 60 minutes, exactly one hour. And the service was outstanding, starting with security guards greeting you with a smile, and ending with the health-care worker who administers the vaccine and sends you on your way with a piece of paper attesting to the vaccination.</p>
<p>"Put that with your important papers," she said pleasantly.</p>
<p>"Good work, thank you."</p>
<p>In all the furor over the H1N1 rollout in the last two weeks, the media and the political class bear some responsibility for raising anxiety levels in this country. Both have lost sight of the inherent patience of Canadians, and the ability of health-care providers to sort out difficulties and deliver the product.</p>
<p>It's one thing to get worked up over pro hockey players jumping the queue ahead of pregnant women. It's another for the opposition Liberals to call the rollout "a national disgrace" or compare it to Hurricane Katrina, which was the tipping point in the political fall from grace of the second George Bush. The blame game is a not a long game, and could be dangerous to the Liberals' health.</p>
<p>Our constitutional division of powers might be imperfect, and might not have envisioned pandemics, but it has served us well enough for nearly a century and a half. Ottawa is responsible for the safety of our citizens, and assuring a supply of vaccine; the provinces are responsible for delivering the service and meeting the demand.</p>
<p>It's the way our country works. And it works best when the people providing the service, and the people receiving it, regard each other with kindness and respect.</p>

<p>Of all the cringe-inducing sentences I've heard on CBC Radio over the years, the following ranks among the worst: "After standing in a parking lot for hours, a health official told these people they were wasting their time." The culprit broadcaster was reporting from St. Eustache on the first day of vaccinations against the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>It's not the health official who was waiting in line, of course, and that's why the sentence is so unfortunate. To make grammatical sense, the reporter should have said: "A health official told these people, who had been standing in a parking lot for hours, that they were wasting their time." Or he could have used the passive voice: "After standing in a parking lot for hours, these people were told ..."</p>
<p>Why does this matter? For several reasons, I'd argue, among them the fact that the audience in a city like Montreal includes many people who are listening in their second or third language. Clarity - in language as in ideas - is crucial.</p>
<p>That applies to newspapers, too. And, I'm sad to say, The Gazette occasionally perpetrates the same kind of grammatical howler I heard on CBC. In last Sunday's paper, an item on the Insight page described an owl in an English zoo who has discovered a liking for pumpkins. Here's how we reported it: "High in vitamins, potassium, protein and fibre, zoo officials said the pumpkin made a perfect enrichment toy ..."</p>
<p>Zoo officials may indeed be high in fibre, but is this something I really need to know?</p>

</div><div>Randy Shore   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>651 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>(From the Vancouver Sun, November 9, 2009) A headline on the top right graphic placed on page A7 of Saturday's Vancouver Sun did not accurately reflect the content of the graph. It should have read: "Percentage of out-patient medical visits reported by general practitioners as due to influenza-like illness in 2008/09 compared to the average for the past 19 seasons." ***** </p>
<p>One of the key tools used by medical authorities to get ahead of a virus as it races through a population is mathematical modelling, which uses computers and a whole host of data to mimic the behaviour of the virus in human populations.</p>
<p>As you take your simple model and add layers of complexity to it, you gain the power to predict a variety of outcomes based on variables such as when the vaccination program starts, how many people are vaccinated before the virus begins to spread widely or who you decide to vaccinate first -- super-spreaders such as school children or low-spreaders such as nursing home clients.</p>
<p>Modelling used today is based on the pioneering work of British epidemiologists W.O. Kermack and A.G. McKendrick, who coined the ideas of the reproductive number, the number of new cases that result from each infection; and the generation time, how long it takes new cases to occur.</p>
<p>The resulting model predicts an attack rate -- how quickly a virus will spread through a given population until those spreading the virus start running into more people with immunity than people who have none. At that point, the pandemic starts to wane and we transition to herd immunity, in which even those without immunity are protected because it is so difficult for the virus to spread.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu has a reproductive number between 1.3 and 1.8. That means each infection will generate about one-and-a-half new cases, said University of Toronto epidemiologist David Fisman, a researcher for the MITACS [Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems] network based in Vancouver.</p>
<p>He noted the bubonic plague that killed 20 per cent of the people in Europe had a reproductive number of 1.2.</p>
<p>He was quick to point out that death is almost certain with the plague and very rare for the swine flu, which is considered mild even for an influenza.</p>
<p>Armed with these numbers, scientists led by the B.C. Centre for Disease Control's director of mathematical modelling Babak Pourbohloul used a computer program populated by 2.4 million nodes, one representing each person in the Lower Mainland. Models can represent populations ranging from a small village to the entire world.</p>
<p>Researchers assign the nodes different characteristics based on what is known about the population, such as how many people are a particular age, how many work in hospitals and in offices and how many are in kindergarten and likely to wipe their noses with their hands.</p>
<p>"We try to connect all those nodes in the way that people connect to each other on a regular day," said Pourbohloul.</p>
<p>Researchers then infect a few nodes and run the program that simulates the spread of the virus thousands or even millions of times to see which scenarios occur most often and use that to predict how the virus will behave in the real world.</p>
<p>That predictive model helps health authorities decide what they should do to either head it off -- which they do fairly successfully with the seasonal flu -- or manage the wildfire-like spread of a pandemic virus to minimize the number of deaths that occur.</p>

</div><div>Elise Stolte   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>1181 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>(From the Edmonton Journal, November 8, 2009) A story on B1 of Saturday's Journal misspelled the name of Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Alberta and a specialist in infectious diseases. ***** </p>
<p>The H1N1 influenza virus seems to infect tissue deeper in the lungs than other strains of the flu, which is one reason why more healthy people are falling seriously ill, says Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Alberta and a specialist in infectious diseases.</p>
<p>People who end up in intensive care units with H1N1 often develop a rare type of viral pneumonia, she says.</p>
<p>Bacterial pneumonia is more common, and usually shows up after a person has started getting better from the flu. Bacteria grow in the lungs while the person is still weak.</p>
<p>With viral pneumonia, the flu virus itself infects the deepest tissues of the lungs. Scientists don't fully understand why, but that's what seems to be landing younger people in the hospital. The lungs become inflamed, the thin, delicate tissues grow thick and the body struggles to absorb oxygen.</p>
<p>Most people who end up in intensive care start to get sick, then rapidly feel themselves getting sicker and sicker without a levelling off, Salinger said. "Those are the people who become very short of breath quickly."</p>
<p>The influenza virus has adapted itself to infect the membranes in the upper and lower respiratory tract, in the nose, throat and lungs, Salinger said. It changes form slightly year by year to get past the body's immune defences.</p>
<p>The virus itself is basically a shell filled with DNA, or its simpler form, RNA, the programming script that dictates what an organism looks like. The virus has no way of growing or reproducing unless it hijacks a host cell, forcing it to spend all of its energy on making more copies of the flu virus. Then it pushes the new viruses out to to infect others and the first cell dies.</p>
<p>The process also irritates the throat and airwaves, which makes the sick person cough, spreading more viruses in small droplets to others.</p>
<p>They can live on a surface for days, waiting for someone else to touch the door handle and then put their hands to their mouths or eyes.</p>
<p>When a person feels sick, they don't feel the presence of the invading virus, Salinger said.</p>
<p>They feel their body's response to the virus as tries to contain the infection.</p>
<p>When the cells detect the presence of the virus, they make proteins that alert other cells and the body's complex immune system ramps up. The infected tissues swell, the flow of blood changes, and the nose and airwaves increase the production of mucus. This also makes a person cough, which is good for the body because it helps to get rid of the virus and any weak, infected cells that slough off from the wall of the throat.</p>
<p>Scientists don't entirely know why the flu makes a person feel sore all over, Saxinger said. But a big part of the immune response is the production of cytokines, "molecules produced by immune cells that affect every part of your body in different ways." They're meant to help, but they make you feel achy and sick.</p>
<p>When people react to the type of flu vaccine given in Canada, they are reacting to dead forms of the virus, which can't reproduce. But the body still gears up to fight the invader. The person feels briefly sick but it's a good sign, Saxinger. said "I always say, good for you. You're making yourself some good immunity."</p>
<p>The main kind of anti-viral medication, Tamiflu, works by preventing the infected cell from releasing the thousands of new viruses it created. Instead, it hangs on to them until a white blood cell comes along, engulfs the infected cell and its viruses, and destroys them all. But the medication works well only if the sick person takes it within the first three days.</p>
<p>Cases like that of Evan Frustaglio, the 13-year-old hockey player from Toronto, who collapsed suddenly and died, are extremely rare. He complained of a sore throat on a Friday night and died the following Monday.</p>
<p>"That's the point that scares everyone about that case," Saxinger said. "It seems like I can't just rely on my own judgment anymore. But really, mostly you can.</p>
<p>"Any time you have an infection that can infect up to a third of the population, you're going to see the full range (in severity) of responses to that infection."</p>
<p>People are probably getting too scared about this pandemic, she said. "It's something to take seriously, certainly it is a real phenomenon and many more people than usual will get sick. But I think people are losing track of the fact we have an influenza epidemic every year."</p>
<p>Even in an atmosphere where it everyone is on edge, "reasonable prudence and logic is enough. You don't have to lose your mind with fear."</p>
<p>The good news in this pandemic is that after the initial mutation, the virus seems to have changed very little. Few people have immunity to H1N1 because its genetic code is a combination of avian, swine and human influenza viruses, and only those older than about 55 have been exposed to a virus that looks anything like it.</p>
<p>But when the scientists picked a sample to make the vaccine in May, they picked a good sample strain, and the vaccine so far appears to give solid immunity against the H1N1 pandemic strain.</p>
<p>Without a vaccine, a person's immune system recognizes the invading virus and starts developing antibodies, but it takes days to even build up enough to help clear the virus. A normal case of influenza take about five to seven days to get over.</p>
<p>A vaccine jump-starts that process, so that by the time the live virus comes along, there are plenty of antibodies already in the blood to identify it, clamp onto it, and prevent it from infecting any cells, Saxinger said. "It neutralizes it."</p>
<p>Provincial lab tests are showing that 90 to 97 per cent of the flu cases coming in now are H1N1, so if a people have been seriously ill with classic flu symptoms--fever, aches and a cough--they probably already have immunity.</p>
<p>But there are still cold viruses and other respiratory infections circulating. The sniffles could be a mild case of the flu, but also could also be unrelated.</p>
<p>Her advice on the flu vaccine: "We don't know how long this flu season will last. If you haven't been sick yet, get it."</p>

</p>
<p>"Keep Calm and Carry On"</p>
<p>Earlier this year, my daughter gave me a framed print with that line. It was widely produced in London during the Second World War. The message was elegant in its simplicity.</p>
<p>The challenges of coping during either of our last "major wars" or other widespread epidemics, puts the H1N1 issue into a bit of perspective. I remember lineups in school gyms for polio, smallpox or chickenpox vaccinations. During the course of the past 40 years, through medical science, some of which was perfected in Canada, most of these horrific diseases were eradicated.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus strikes terror in many parents. It is the fear of the unknown. Two highly publicized deaths, of a young boy in Toronto and a girl in Waterloo, sparked massive lineups at public health clinics across Ontario.</p>
<p>H1N1 has called into question the state of preparedness by the federal and provincial governments and local health agencies. Like any event of its kind, it challenges systems, procedures, medical science and, sometimes, common sense. The Canadian public is confused about H1N1 flu. Government information has been unreliable. Media have been no more helpful.</p>
<p>Ontario residents are upset with the delays and lineups associated with a major medical event, which most people knew would happen. Lineups in the cold and rain may well induce other medical problems.</p>
<p>Some communities have managed quite well. North Bay and Thunder Bay have organized indoor clinics that have moved quickly. Hamilton and Burlington have done reasonably well under the circumstances.</p>
<p>The major flaw in the dispensing of the H1N1 vaccine has been an ill-advised bureaucratic preoccupation with setting up special clinics. For reasons known only to public health officials, these clinics were established, effectively bypassing family doctors.</p>
<p>Family doctors are the front line of health care. In the course of one visit the family doctor might well help the patient with other medical issues. The doctor's offices and walk-in clinics may be "private" ... who cares?</p>
<p>One would have hoped that following the SARS crisis of 2003, our institutional knowledge of epidemics would have improved. It hasn't. People who are not qualified or entitled to get the vaccine yet, have jumped the line. Public health officials have ignored it the same way the nice lady at the grocery store knowingly looks at you when you have 15 items in the express lane at the store.</p>
<p>Canada is one of the few places in the world where you can obtain the vaccine at no cost, and in a relatively timely manner. Americans have one third of the amount of vaccine that we have, and have to pay for it themselves.</p>
<p>Free health care is part of our DNA. That said, we have obligations to try to manage our own health-care outcomes. This starts with not smoking, moderation in terms of alcohol consumption, and proper nutrition. We have obligations to family, co-workers, and fellow students to do our best to reduce the spread of H1N1, any other flu or any infectious disease. The root of all of this is common sense, and personal responsibility. It means carrying a handkerchief, managing public hygiene. Perhaps staying home when you know you are unwell. Those in public office will go a long way in elevating public confidence by avoiding the "blame game." We should all hope that we can produce enough vaccine to ensure that everyone who wants an H1N1 shot can get one, before they become infected and possibly spread the disease to others.</p>
<p>Early November is a time of year when many of us reflect upon the sacrifices of those who fought in the two "Great Wars." We lost more young men in several days of combat, than we will to the "regular flu" or the H1N1 flu. Fortunately, today, our war efforts are limited, and perhaps coming to a conclusion. And the ability of medical science to combat these pernicious diseases is much stronger.</p>
<p>Hats off to those working in the clinics and at our family doctor's offices. "Keep Calm and Carry On" as the sturdy Brits said. We'll get through this.</p>

<p>Re: 'Politicians turned a blind eye to public safety' (Letters, Nov. 3)</p>
<p>Nurses, personal support workers and housekeepers have been highly trained in processes to reduce/ remove germs and avoid cross-contamination. They are not responsible for this disease or its spread. Newcomers are not bringing the virus here; the writer groups them as though they have never used a tissue. Research suggests most cases of H1N1 are reported in the U.S. Perhaps these are the newcomers who must learn our way of germ evasion.</p>
<p>No one is purposely spreading illness; one is infected long before symptoms are visible.</p>
<p>While we complain that vaccines should have been available earlier, we are living in real time. One cannot snap fingers to have a vaccine ready overnight. Politicians are no more to blame than nurses, PSWs, newcomers or even the "swine" the virus is named for. Could clinics have been handled differently? Sure -- but we have the advantage of judging after the fact.</p>
<p>How politicians are failing to make our workers No. 1 is a separate issue to H1N1. I don't understand the connection the writer is making. But I do agree with her that keeping our germs to ourselves in our own homes at this time could reduce the risk of transmission.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu is spreading</b>
</div><div>Viewpoint: Asahi Shimbun (Tokyo):</div>
<div>478 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>WR08</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>The new swine flu (H1N1) epidemic is spreading, especially in and around major cities. Especially worrisome is the fact it is mostly children who are becoming seriously ill and need to be hospitalized. Children 9 or younger accounted for 60 per cent of all hospitalized patients. Those 14 or younger represented as many as 80 per cent.</p>
<p>It was believed those with pre-existing conditions like asthma were more likely to develop serious conditions, but so far, many of the hospitalized patients were healthy children. In some cases, despite the fact they had received early treatment, their symptoms rapidly deteriorated, leading sometimes to death.</p>
<p>Saving the lives of our children must be our top priority.</p>
<p>In some regions, inoculations for those other than doctors and medical services personnel began Oct. 30. However, according to the priorities set down by the health ministry, pregnant women and patients with pre-existing conditions are first in line. Inoculations for children without illnesses are due to start in early December or later.</p>
<p>Vaccinations are believed effective in preventing infections or preventing the symptoms from growing severe. Experts and medical organizations say small children should be inoculated earlier.</p>
<p>The Tokyo metropolitan government recently decided that inoculations of preschool children would be moved up so that they will get the shots from mid-November. This is because a number of small children without pre-existing conditions have died from encephalopathy. It is safe to assume other local government authorities are as alarmed over the situation as Tokyo officials. In a policy change, doctors and medical services personnel no longer need to be inoculated twice, so more vaccines can be used on small children.</p>
<p>It was thought epidemics starting in schools would spread to society at large, and become a serious threat to those with pre-existing conditions. However, fortunately, the number of serious cases has been smaller than originally expected.</p>
<p>The health ministry should quickly get a handle on the situation, and re-examine how the vaccines should be utilized. This is the first time our nation has experienced a full-blown new influenza epidemic. It is necessary for the government to review its policy in a flexible manner on the basis of scientific data.</p>
<p>The administration, which aims to establish political leadership in governing the nation, should exercise its political prowess in working out effective policies by receiving proper input from medical experts.</p>
<p>Providing accurate and clear information to the public is also important.</p>
<p>The Japan Pediatric Society has asked the health ministry to lead the way in establishing a co-operative network among local hospitals and clinics, and also to urge the public to visit the clinics during the daytime.</p>
<p>The government should do everything it can to save children's lives, and to support the pediatricians who work diligently day and night.</p>

<p>Re: 'Flu fears give a boost to Clorox profits' (Nov. 3)</p>
<p>This rise in profits and increase in price of shares for Clorox Co. proves the only thing that cures fear is the fear of something else.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, headlines were filled with alarming updates on the recession, and people were overly cautious with expenditures. This further affected the fall of the worldwide economy.</p>
<p>Now, news of H1N1 flu has driven stories of the recession from our front pages. Those who were once vigilant with their cash are throwing it at companies that promise protection against this flu.</p>
<p>Although it is excellent that money is pouring back into the economy, it is almost humorous that something that dominated headlines for so many months and that is still in effect is forgotten so easily once something else that generates a widespread fear comes into the spotlight.</p>
<p>If H1N1 has been good for anything, it has provided a distraction from, and perhaps a solution to, financial woes.</p>

<p>What's an app? It's a bite-sized bit of software that can be downloaded to a mobile phone.</p>
<p>Why are they important? They turn a smartphone (which has its own operating system and web capabilities) into a customized business tool, game player, life enhancer, navigation device, reference library, music player, photo editor ... virtually anything at all.</p>
<p>The numbers: Apple's App Store, the biggest player on the scene by far, just this week surpassed 100,000 apps. There have been more than two billion downloads since the store opened in July 2008. The average iPhone or iPod touch user has 25 to 30 apps at any time.</p>
<p>Other players: BlackBerry, Google, Windows Mobile, Nokia and Palm all have their own app stores. But they have a fraction of the offerings of Apple. Other giants like Yahoo! are looking to get into the game as well.</p>
<p>The cost: Many apps in the App Store are free. Others range from $0.99 to $2.99. Some business or specialized apps such as medical encyclopedias can cost $50 to $100.</p>
<p>Most expensive: A $999.99 app called I Am Rich was billed as a "work of art with no hidden function at all." Its only purpose was to show others you could afford it. It was yanked by Apple a day after its launch in August 2008 after a host of complaints. It was reported eight people had already bought it.</p>
<p>A few of our favourite apps</p>
<p>Wunder Radio</p>
<p>This won the MacWorld 2008 best radio app award. It streams more than 30,000 Internet radio stations, and users can search by location and genre and send Twitter messages to their favourite DJs. ($6.99)</p>
<p>Let's Golf</p>
<p>Animated golf in 3D, featuring 63 holes in Fiji, England, Scotland and the United States. Customize characters, play in multi-player mode and choose level of difficulty. Advanced is like a sports simulator and users can even add spin. Casual cuts down on the bogies, but you still can't cheat. ($1.99)</p>
<p>NFB Films</p>
<p>This app has been highly praised on arts and tech blogs. The National Film Board of Canada opens up its vaults to stream more than 1,000 movies, documentaries, animations and trailers. The offerings include the hockey classic, The Sweater. (Free)</p>
<p>Dude Deluxe</p>
<p>In the 'Huh?' department, this app has dozens of recordings of people saying what the developers call the "most versatile and popular word in the English language." They promise "hours and hours of fun" as you try to determine whether the word is used to admonish, interrogate, deflate or celebrate. ($0.99)</p>
<p>Beat the Swine 09</p>
<p>You are an antibody superhero taking on H1N1 travelling through 15 body parts. Other apps are more serious, tracking and mapping the appearance and severity of the virus. ($0.99)</p>
<p>Scanner 911</p>
<p>Listen in to the LAPD, NYPD and other police, fire and EMS radio channels all over Canada and the U.S. You can also record transmissions and listen later. It's the top-paid app on the iTunes store. ($0.99)</p>
<p>Tap Tap Revenge 3</p>
<p>Tap and shake along to beats from preloaded songs or buy new ones. Play the system or take on others online. It's the third most popular paid app right now. ($0.99)</p>
<p>I Am T-Pain</p>
<p>Fans can karaoke to preloaded songs, or buy more, and through a program called Auto-Tune, the software changes their voice into T-Pain's robot-like voice. It's generated a lot of celebrity buzz and is on track to pull in $3 million this year. ($2.99)</p>
<p>iHandy Carpenter</p>
<p>No need to go to the basement for a toolbox. This virtual version features a level, plumb, protractor, and ruler. Just don't try to use it as a hammer. ($1.99)</p>

<p>* Set policy: Decide whether employees who have any flu symptoms will be told to stay away from the office. Will they require a doctor's note?</p>
<p>* Equip employees: Give them hand sanitizers as well as access to information about the flu, its symptoms and how to stay healthy.</p>
<p>* Share the load: Figure out work-sharing agreements, with rivals if necessary, to ensure customers' needs will be met even if absenteeism doubles or triples.</p>

<p>If you ask Lauren Gervais how she's feeling this week, the answer is: "Good. No flu." But if the H1N1 virus does knock on the door at Gervais's market research firm, Data Probe, she will be ready.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg entrepreneur has been checking the World Health Organization's website to track the progress of the flu. She's provided 150 employees with hand sanitizer, encourages those who are high-risk to get vaccinated, and told them to stay home if they aren't feeling well.</p>
<p>Most importantly, she has a work-sharing agreement with her competitors. If the flu keeps the seats at her call centre empty, she can subcontract her firm's work so it still gets done and she keeps her clients happy.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, they will ride it out, Gervais said.</p>
<p>"Small business is the backbone of the economy so we just have to keep chugging along."</p>
<p>Across the country, businesses are quietly making plans to ensure that, in the face of the flu, the lights stay on and customers can keep coming through the door.</p>
<p>At least, that's what some are doing.</p>
<p>Two recent surveys have found most small businesses, in particular, are unprepared for any event that may disrupt the workflow, and only a minority actively make contingency plans.</p>
<p>A June survey by the Bank of Montreal found that 82 per cent of Canadian small businesses did not have what business experts call a health-related continuity plan.</p>
<p>"When you consider the potential risk to business, this low level of preparedness is disturbing," said Cathy Pin, vice-president of commercial banking.</p>
<p>A quarter of respondents said having a plan was not a priority. A poll by American Express Canada uncovered a similar sentiment:</p>
<p>40 per cent of respondents said a plan was a low on their list, too.</p>
<p>"The kind of economy we've been in, in the last 18 months makes it difficult for them to step back and prepare for something like this," said Howard Grosfield, general manager of small business services at American Express Canada.</p>
<p>Banks, financial institutions and business groups such as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce have posted tool kits on their websites for small business owners who want to develop a plan.</p>
<p>At Telus Corp., the focus is on communicating with employees, said senior communications manager Shawn Hall. It has launched a special section on its internal website giving flu updates, health information and links to government authorities.</p>
<p>"Our overall plan goes back two or three decades. We keep refining it. We updated it for SARS and we updated it for H1N1," Hall said. "Companies that plan for any eventuality tend to survive crises. Companies that look at that as a luxury tend to fail."</p>
<p>Nearly half of Telus's 35,000 employees are already set up to work from home or another site through using laptops, video and audio conferencing, and a virtual private network that keeps the company's data secure. Several hundred of its call-centre employees already work from home.</p>
<p>Employees showing any flu-like symptoms, even mild ones, are told to stay away from the workplace.</p>
<p>In B.C. and Alberta, where Telus operates the 911 emergency systems, extensive cross-training</p>
<p>ensures that properly trained</p>
<p>employees can cover for absent colleagues.</p>
<p>"That means those technical teams don't feel like they need to be the hero and come in and infect the rest of the team," Hall said.</p>
<p>The task of preparing for an event that may never come to pass can seem daunting for a small business, Grosfield said. It's important to remember that each company is different and would have different priorities in an emergency.</p>
<p>"Businesses need to think about: what are the top one or two things that would create the biggest issue for the kind of business we're in, and what are the top one or two things that we could do to solve for that?" Grosfield said.</p>
<p>For many firms, clarifying company policy would be a good start.</p>
<p>"You'd better make sure that supervisors know what to say. They're going to be getting calls from employees asking: 'My son came home with a fever. What should I do?'" said Rod Phillips, president and chief executive of Shepell.fgi, an employee assistance plan provider.</p>
<p>Shepell.fgi handles about 4,000 calls from workers each day.</p>
<p>"The biggest single increase in calls has been people asking about health," Phillips said.</p>
<p>Small business owners also need to determine whether they have the technology to handle a large number of employees working away from their usual workplace. Many may need to upgrade.</p>
<p>"This is the right excuse for companies to look at the technology that is available," said Jeff Lorenz, vice-president of sales and marketing for Primus Canada. "That is going to benefit you day-to-day but also give you the flexibility of dealing with the unforeseen."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A third wave? Experts debate vaccine timing</b>
</div><div>Joanna Frketich  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>1051 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>The spectre of a third wave of H1N1 is being raised as Hamilton and Halton are at the peak of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Whether this flu will come back for one more round between January and March is the big question infectious disease experts are hotly debating.</p>
<p>The answer is critical as the general public decides whether there is any point to getting vaccinated as the current wave of H1N1 winds down here. Currently, only those at highest risk are supposed to get the shot with no time set for when it will be more widely available.</p>
<p>Public health officials overwhelmingly say it's not late to get immunized as H1N1 is expected to be around for at least four to five more weeks and the shots could be key to avoiding a third wave.</p>
<p>"It is worthwhile to get," said Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious disease prevention and control at Ontario's Agency for Health Protection and Promotion. "The majority of people have not been infected yet so in my mind it makes sense. What's the downside? Scientifically there is no downside."</p>
<p>A minority of infectious disease experts disagree. They doubt there will be a third wave and believe the threat of H1N1 has passed.</p>
<p>"If you're a healthy person and the outbreak has already come and gone from your area, I'm not aware of any good reason why you should be immunized," said Dr. Richard Schabas, Ontario's medical officer of health from 1987 to 1997. "The benefits would be very small and probably not enough to justify the cost and the inconvenience."</p>
<p>He says Ontario "just barely missed" getting the vaccine out in time.</p>
<p>"If we'd had the vaccine even three to four weeks earlier, it would have been much more effective," he said. "The lesson about vaccine is get the vaccine before the outbreak, not during the outbreak. That's when it really makes a difference."</p>
<p>Schabas along with Oakville infectious disease expert Dr. Neil Rau believe the threat of a third wave is only being raised to justify universal vaccination.</p>
<p>"It just seems to me to be like grasping at straws, like trying to find something else to keep people worried about," said Schabas. "The issue now is that they want people to be immunized. There was a decision that everyone needs to be immunized and if people get the idea that the danger is passed, then they're not going to be immunized. I think that's what it's about. Personally, I think the danger such as it was has by and large passed."</p>
<p>Most health officials aren't so quick to let their guard down about H1N1, which hit first in April and then again in October.</p>
<p>Hospitals are still bracing for a wave of serious illness as H1N1 makes it way through the community, starting with kids in school and moving on to the elderly and those with chronic illness, who are more likely to end up in intensive care.</p>
<p>"We're in very early days yet, frankly," said Dr. David Higgins, chief of staff at St. Joseph's Healthcare. "I remain very anxious because I think we haven't seen the impact yet of the virus on the more fragile and elderly people in the community. The timing of the epidemic is the young people first, the kids, then the parents and then the middle-age to older people as it spreads around the community. Those are the folks who often have more significant medical problems who would be at greater risk once they get the infection."</p>
<p>Plus most people haven't had H1N1 yet despite widespread flu in this area, says Dr. Chris Mackie, Hamilton's associate medical officer of health.</p>
<p>He notes tests show only about half of people with flu-like symptoms actually have H1N1. It's a high number -- more than double what is seen in a typical flu season -- but nowhere near the majority.</p>
<p>Mackie says only those with a laboratory-confirmed case of H1N1 should skip the shot.</p>
<p>"I hope that people continue to come and get the vaccine," he said. "We're probably at or near the peak right now. but there's two halves to a peak and we still have half the wave to go through."</p>
<p>It's also key to preventing a third wave in Hamilton.</p>
<p>"Assuming people keep coming to get the vaccine, then I don't think we'll have much of a third wave if any," said Mackie. "The chances of us getting one in Hamilton are pretty low. We've been hit very hard now so we have a lot of immunity in the community. We've got a lot of vaccine out and we're going to get a lot more vaccine out."</p>
<p>If past pandemics are any indication, third waves tend to have much less impact in communities hardest hit during the second wave.</p>
<p>In the 1918 pandemic, the second wave came in October and the third between January and March, 1919.</p>
<p>In 1957, the second wave came in November and the third in March, 1958.</p>
<p>"The Spanish flu gives one example of where in the same winter season there were two waves and how bad the second of those two waves were depended on how heavy that first wave was," said Dr. Monir Taha, Halton's associate medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"Those cities in the U.S. that had massive outbreaks in October, they had a very small peak in January, February and March. The cities that didn't have as big a wave in October, had somewhat pronounced waves in January, February or March."</p>
<p>The hope is that Hamilton and Halton will be protected from a third wave because they were among the earliest areas of the province reporting widespread H1N1, but with flu there is no guarantee.</p>
<p>"There's still a great deal of unknowns," said Gardam. "You never know what flu is going to do."</p>

</p>
<p>As outrage grows over hospital boards and professional sports teams jumping the queue for H1N1 shots in Toronto, Hamilton health officials continue to give the vaccine to some healthy people although immunization clinics are for high-risk only.</p>
<p>Associate medical officer of health Dr. Chris Mackie said these are rare exceptions where family members attending clinics with a high-risk individual receive the vaccine although they don't meet the criteria.</p>
<p>Mackie stressed this is the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p>He was responding to reports of members of the general public receiving H1N1 shots when lineups are down.</p>
<p>"I can't speak for every case, but our system isn't perfect," Mackie said. "We're still focusing on high risk."</p>
<p>Despite reports that supplies might run out, Hamilton's community clinics remain open next week at the usual locations and times.</p>
<p>Ontario announced yesterday it is receiving another allotment, of 770,000 doses (about half of them unadjuvanted for pregnant women), next week from the federal government and Mackie expects to get Hamilton's portion by Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
<p>Should Hamilton run out before then, clinics will close only briefly, he said.</p>
<p>The number of doses Hamilton will receive is unknown, but Mackie expects it will be comparable to the size of shipments received in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>Ontario Health Minister Deb Matthews yesterday urged healthcare professionals to stick to strict guidelines for administering the vaccine to high-risk groups until there are enough doses available to immunize everyone.</p>
<p>"I am asking everyone to respect the definition of priority groups," she said. "Do the right thing. Wait your turn."</p>
<p>High-risk groups include pregnant women, children under 5, health-care workers, and people under 65 who have a medical condition.</p>
<p>In Hamilton, neither St. Joseph's Healthcare nor Hamilton Health Sciences have given the vaccine to their hospital board members, spokespersons for the two hospitals said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hamilton's boards of education are seeing a decrease in schools with flu outbreaks. There are 50 public school outbreaks compared to a peak of 70 last week, and 11 Catholic school outbreaks compared to 17 last week.</p>
<p>"The tides are turning," said Jackie Bajus, a Catholic board superintendent.</p>
<p>But flu illness continues to rise locally and across Ontario. The local proportion of H1N1 positive tests rose to 48 per cent last week, up from 38 the previous week.</p>

</p>
<p>TRANSPORTATION REPORTER</p>
<p>The erosion in Air Canada's business-class revenue is becoming less severe, sparking hope that the travel market is finally on the mend.</p>
<p>“The worst of the worst seems to be behind us,” Air Canada chief executive officer Calin Rovinescu said during a conference call yesterday, after announcing a profitable third quarter due to foreign-exchange gains. “We're seeing sprouts of green coming up from the earth. ”</p>
<p>In the third quarter, Canada's largest carrier saw its revenue from premium travellers decrease 16 per cent from the same period in 2008, marking an improvement from the 30-per-cent decline for the second quarter.</p>
<p>The airline was able to lure back some corporate travellers in the third quarter after introducing a lower-priced ticket for its “Executive Class” category earlier this year. The reduced fares in the premium cabin carry restrictions such as advance purchase and minimum stay periods.</p>
<p>In combatting weak travel demand, Montreal-based Air Canada has spruced up service in business class, offering more choices for meals and new amenity kits.</p>
<p>Mr. Rovinescu expects corporate travel budgets to gradually loosen up, but cautioned that it could take until mid-2011 before there is full recovery.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">British Airways PLC</span> is also seeing smaller declines in traffic, part of an industry trend. But the International Air Transport Association noted that global carriers lost a combined $6-billion (U.S.) in the first half of this year, and the industry is on track to lose $11-billion in 2009.</p>
<p>IATA estimates that average premium fares globally in July slumped 18 per cent, compared with the same month last year, while economy ticket prices fell 14 per cent.</p>
<p>In the latest quarter, Air Canada's operating profit fell 39 per cent to $68-million (Canadian), while revenue slid 13 per cent to $2.67-billion, including an estimated $10-million reduction due to the H1N1 influenza outbreak.</p>
<p>The company's operating loss in the first nine months soared to $233-million, compared with an $18-million loss for the same period last year. In July, the carrier lined up $1-billion in financing and cut costs, avoiding filing for bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p>Robert Kokonis, president of airline consulting firm AirTrav Inc., said Air Canada's third-quarter unit revenue – a key industry measure stated in revenue per available seat mile – fell 10.2 per cent, compared with <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>.'s steeper drop of 15.5 per cent.</p>
<p>Air Canada is paying more attention to the eastern triangle of Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, where three-year-old <span class="companylink">Porter Airlines Inc</span>. has been making inroads.</p>
<p>While Air Canada operates from Toronto's Pearson International Airport, privately owned Porter is based at Toronto City Centre Airport, located on an island near the city's downtown business core.</p>
<p>Mr. Rovinescu said he wants regional carrier Jazz, which flies on behalf of Air Canada, to return to the island airport in 2010, when Porter's “exclusivity arrangements” expire.</p>

<p>Just as Toronto extends the operating hours of its H1N1 vaccination clinics, Peel is shutting down all clinics in the region for four days because of a vaccine shortage. Peel Public Health announced yesterday that clinics will be closed Sunday through Wednesday because "they do not have enough vaccine to operate." The vaccination centres are expected to reopen on Nov. 12, but with reduced hours, spokeswoman Janet Eagleson said. Almost 25,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine have been injected in Peel clinics, she said. Meanwhile, the 10 vaccination clinics in Toronto have started staying open later in the evenings and five will be open Sundays, starting this week. Those locations include Metro Hall, Timothy Eaton Business and Technical Institute, and the East York, North York and Etobicoke civic centres. Susan Sperling at Toronto Public Health said the clinics have not experienced shortages.</p>

<p>BLOGTO.COM ROUNDS UP THE WEEK'S HEADLINES ETOBICOKE</p>
<p>Residents are being warned about a scam involving a pair of "noncitizens" who claim that they're unable to collect lottery winnings due to their citizenship status. Be astute -- don't take strangers you just met in a bus shelter to an ATM and give them $18,000!</p>
<p>CITY HALL</p>
<p>The City of Toronto made a move toward greater transparency this week, by opening its data doors to the public on a website that makes large quantities of information accessible. Hopefully Torontonians will find creative uses for the fairly mundane data.</p>
<p>YORK MILLS</p>
<p>Parents discovered a razor in candy given to their kid on Halloween. Doesn't this happen pretty much every year? At least the area didn't fall victim to the armed, mugging, purple Teletubby that struck in London, Ont.</p>
<p>Indictable kidnapping charges against neighbourhood grocer David Chen have been dropped, but he still stands accused of lesser charges of assault and forcible confinement for the incident that occurred this summer (when he chased down and held a shoplifter until police arrived).</p>
<p>HARBOURFRONT</p>
<p>While enjoying a glass of wine after performing at Harbourfront Centre, a Canadian lyrical tenor was unaware that his car was going up in flames in a nearby parking lot. Arson is suspected.</p>
<p>Residents should keep watchful eyes on their cats and Chihuahuas. Coyotes are once again lurking in the neighbourhood, and they'll likely be looking for pint-sized snackables.</p>
<p>IN LINEUPS</p>
<p>High-risk groups seeking H1N1 vaccinations at local clinics waited in long lines. What's worse is that there's a shortage of vaccine, and the invitation to the general public to get the shot has been deferred to next week. And how about them Leafs and Raptors? I thought the only risk they faced was losing. Is it fair to call this a fiasco yet?</p>
<p>EVERYWHERE</p>
<p>A proposed (and significant!) fare hike for TTC use has some riders wondering if $126 for a Metropass will represent good value come January 2010, or if they'll instead walk everywhere in the dead of winter in protest. Tunes will surely change once wind chill brings temperatures of -40C.</p>

</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I caught Jim Cramer on his CNBC TV show, Mad Money, and listened to his 25 Rules of Investing, along with his Mad Money Stock Worksheet.</p>
<p>These are some examples I fully support.</p>
<p>What sector does the company belong to (natural market rotation), and how has that sector performed? Don't own too many names (overdiversification). Be a TV critic (the experts have conflicts and self-serving agendas) and there's always a bull market (it's up to you or your adviser to find it).</p>
<p>Let me now table two groups of investment strategies, split between those that tend to work and those that tend not to.</p>
<p>Strategies that tend not to work:</p>
<p>Short-term daily charts are fine for the financial pages, but they do not set out the longer-term trends required for investment decisions.</p>
<p>Engaging in sheep-like behaviour by entering overcrowed trades. Some examples were the red-hot potash and energy companies in early 2008. The current overcrowed trade is the buy-gold and sell-the-dollar trade, so use caution here.</p>
<p>Acting on, or following investment folklore such as seasonality, which is now too widely followed to be of any value - when we all know something will work, it usually won't. So don't sell and go away just because it's May.</p>
<p>Investment decisions based on economic data. Follow these numbers and you may as well follow the business headlines of three months ago.</p>
<p>Acting on "buy" recommendations from experts, and then expecting a phone call when they are selling.</p>
<p>Strategies that tend to work:</p>
<p>Following the market leaders such as the financial sector, the technology sector and the materials sector, because no bull market can exist without the participation of these key stock sectors.</p>
<p>Follow weekly and monthly charts, because they set out the longer-term trends in the major stock indexes. This will at least identify bull and bear markets. Keep in mind the duration of the average bull phase is about 28 months, give or take, and the bear phases generally last 15 months.</p>
<p>Use obscure and simple analysis, because if most participants are using the popular 50- and 200-day moving average crossover, you end up following the crowd (remember those sheep). Another overused study is the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) momentum indicator. Some obscure studies are trend lines, cycles, spreads, divergence and point & figure charting.</p>
<p>Our chart this week shows the monthly closes of the Dow Jones industrial average spanning about 15 years.</p>
<p>The Dow is an important bellwether because it is loaded with large multinational companies that are direct beneficiaries of the global economy. If the Dow sneezes, we all get H1N1.</p>
<p>I have placed very long-term trend lines to identify bull and bear conditions. Trend lines are placed joining the lows during price advances and conversely placed to join the peaks during price downtrends. The idea is to join at least three lows in an uptrend or three peaks in a downtrend.</p>
<p>A trend change, or juncture, occurs when any trend line is violated. Caveat: always use a semi-log scale when placing trend lines on long-term charts.</p>
<p>I have identified the bull phase of April 1995 through to February 2001. The bull ended when the Dow broke down under the 1995-2001 trend line. The following down trend ended on or about October 2003 when the Dow broke up above the 2001-2003 down trend line.</p>
<p>The last bull phase is set out in the upward 2002-2008 trend line with the break down signalled in February 2008. The most recent signal was a break above the declining trend line in September 2009 to signal a new bull market.</p>
<p>The only take-away is the slow signals that could be fine-tuned using weekly charts. Have fun, and don't share our little secret.</p>

<p>Forever grateful to two strangers</p>
<p>ONE day at the grocery store after a big shop to stock up, I reached into my purse for my wallet and to my horror, it wasn't there.</p>
<p>I frantically searched my purse and the bags I had brought and still couldn't find it. Then I realized that I had left the wallet on the bus.</p>
<p>I automatically thought, "My money is gone," and I panicked. I had hundreds of dollars in there. Surely, the money was gone by now. All I could do was call Winnipeg Transit, explain the situation and pray and hope someone was honest enough to turn in the wallet to the bus driver.</p>
<p>I was told that anything found on the bus would be turned in to the depot on Main Street when the driver was done his shift in about an hour. But I was without a car and couldn't quickly get to the depot from Portage Avenue and School Road.</p>
<p>That was when I witnessed the most incredible act of kindness I have ever seen. The customer next to me in line had seen my meltdown, and she offered to drive me to the depot. I was so grateful, beyond words.</p>
<p>This was only the beginning of some incredible acts of kindness, though.</p>
<p>When we reached the depot, the driver hadn't made it in yet so we sat and waited almost 45 minutes. I learned a few things about this kind woman, including that we share the same first name.</p>
<p>When the bus driver arrived, my wallet was among the items he turned in to the lost and found -- and all the money was there, too! I was so grateful to the person who found it and turned it in, I cried.</p>
<p>But, it didn't end there. The other Diane drove me back to the grocery store, and despite having worked a full day already, she drove me home with my groceries. She wouldn't even accept gas money.</p>
<p>She and the person who turned my wallet in restored my faith in people. I am forever grateful to them both.</p>

<p>Flu clinic staff were extra-special</p>
<p>WE are the parents of an autistic, non-verbal 17-year-old girl with asthma. Melanie would not understand the importance of waiting for the flu shot.</p>
<p>We had been turned away from clinics earlier in the week because of masses of people waiting for the shot.</p>
<p>When we tried the flu clinic at the Grant Park Shopping Centre, Melanie started shrieking from fear and anxiety of being in a crowded place, and we had to leave.</p>
<p>On Oct. 30, after our daughter went to school, we headed to the H1N1 flu clinic at St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church on Grant Avenue.</p>
<p>We waited 45 minutes in the cold until the doors opened at 10 a.m., and we got inside the warm building. By 11 a.m., we'd been processed and were waiting our turn for the shot. There were only 150 people in front of us.</p>
<p>After we found out how long the wait would be, we talked to one of the staff about our daughter's special needs. She told us we could talk to the on-site manager.</p>
<p>We went and got our daughter and consulted the manager. We were immediately removed from the noisy waiting area to a quiet room where we were able to wait for our shots.</p>
<p>We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the staff member, the manager (we think her name is Jane) and the nurse, Maybelle. They treated us with such kindness.</p>
<p>Words do not begin to describe how grateful we are to these special people at this very busy flu clinic.</p>
<p>-- Brenda and Phil Halprin</p>
<p>Strawberries sprinkled with a senior's kindness</p>
<p>proved a sweet treat</p>
<p>My story goes back to 1969 or 1970 when I was about five years old. I was with my mom and two little brothers riding on the transit bus on a hot summer day. I am sure we must have been fussing and giving my poor mom grief about being hot.</p>
<p>An elderly man sitting near us opened up his grocery bag and pulled out a pint of strawberries and offered us kids the treat. I remember them as being the best strawberries I had ever tasted -- possibly because they were sprinkled with kindness.</p>
<p>Through the years, I think of that older gentleman who acted in kindness to a native family on a bus, and I say Meegwetch.</p>

<p>Leona Aglukkaq</p>
<p>... the federal minister of health.</p>
<p>There has been blundering all over the map as Canada tries to get ready for an outbreak of the H1N1 flu, but the early returns show Ottawa as the most culpable and Aglukkaq as having a woefully weak grasp of the vaccine situation and her portfolio in general. After encouraging all Canadians to get the shot, and after watching the provinces mount their awareness campaigns, her department sprang the news that there was nowhere near enough vaccine.</p>

<p>At the annual rally to celebrate the takeover of the U.S. embassy 30 years ago, much of the crowd obediently chanted "Death to America" outside the building that used to house the embassy. But far too many threw away the script and shouted "Death to the dictator." Others marched in silence, flashing V-for-victory and still others wore green scarves or wristbands in the colours of Mir Hossein Mousavi, who claims Ahmadinejad stole the election from him by fraud.

<p>Spin it as they might, his spokesmen couldn't polish the Democratic party's defeats in the two gubernatorial elections on Tuesday.

It will be blood in the water for the Republican sharks circling for next year's midterm elections, when a third of the Senate, all of the House of Representatives and most governorships are on the ballot.</p>

</p>
<p>Before I start talking about H1N1, I think it’s important to state what I’m not: I’m not a doctor, nor an expert in disease control and immunology. I’m also not a wack-job conspiracy theorist inclined to bethink large pharmaceutical companies, in conjunction with the federal government, are intent on poisoning us. What I am is a parent with two children, one of whom is in the priority group for H1N1immunization, struggling with the decision on whether to vaccinate my kids. While I don’t want to influence anyone else’s decision, here’s how my wife and I went about making ours. My first challenge was to assess the risk the virus posed to my children. Both are healthy. They have no known allergies and take no medications regularly. As one is in school and the other in full-time day care, they get their share of colds and occasional bouts of the flu. I often joke that the Running of the Noses is an annual event in our family from October until May.</p>
<p> And while reports of H1N1deaths are concerning, it’s important to realize people die from the flu every year, cases that go largely unreported by the news media. And almost everything I’ve read from reliable sources — defined by me as mainstream media and traditional medical organizations — indicates H1N1 is no more deadly than normal seasonal flu. I’ve also been interested in the case of Australia. Because it’s in the southern hemisphere, Australia’s flu season is now largely over and it had fewer than 200 deaths — and nothing to indicate that it was taking down kids in massive numbers. Based on my research, I’ve decided the H1N1flu does not pose an undue risk to my kids. They may get sick, yes, but I don’t think they are likely to die from it. But why not take the better safe than sorry route and get the children vaccinated, as many parents I’ve talked to have done? There are a few reasons, but it boils down to the fact I have concerns about the possible long-term effects of the vaccine. I’ve done hours and hours of reading on adjuvants, squalene and mercury and have subjected myself to some truly bizarre conspiracy theories regarding vaccinations. And while I’m inclined to believe the H1N1vaccine — which is not only new but produced in a new way, at least for flu vaccines — is safe, I can’t find a single study that tells me what the long-term effects might be. That’s because there isn’t one. Other factors: the vaccine takes two weeks to become effective and H1N1is already here; it isn’t 100-percent effective in all people and I think my three-year-old is more likely to get sick from standing in the freezing cold for hours waiting for a shot. In other words, I could vaccinate them and they might still get the flu. The standard public health response to all this is that the risk posed by the vaccine is far less than the risk posed by H1N1. It’s a good argument and it’s probably true, but there’s no way to know for sure. This has been one of our most difficult decisions as parents. While I feel perfectly comfortable making decisions for my own health — I don’t get yearly flu vaccines it should be said — the consequences of this decision have kept up me nights. If I’m wrong and something happens to my children, I’ll never forgive myself. Because of those dire consequences, I think it’s vitally important parents make sure they and their kids do the little things — wash their hands, eat properly, sleep lots — as well as the big things: educate themselves and make the best decision they can. Somewhere in the mass of information, amid the waves of hysteria and fear, our parental instincts are often our best tools.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>The exodus continues from Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff's inner circle.</p>
<p>Two more aides confirmed late Friday they're leaving the leader's office, a week after Ignatieff turfed his chief of staff, Ian Davey.</p>
<p>Mark Sakamoto and Alexis Levine, both directors of political operations, are returning to the private sector.</p>
<p>Both say they're leaving voluntarily.</p>
<p>"I won't be returning to Ottawa as my two-month old baby and lovely wife are in Toronto and I need to focus on them," Sakamoto said in an email.</p>
<p>"Of course, I remain a staunch supporter of Mr. Ignatieff and wish him and the team the best."</p>
<p>Sakamoto was inadvertently involved in controversy this week when he was interviewed by the CBC as he, his wife and their infant baby stood in line awaiting vaccination against H1N1 flu. He criticized the disorganized inoculation campaign without identifying himself as an aide to Ignatieff.</p>
<p>Sakamoto's comments were broadcast on CBC's The National but were pulled as soon as a producer recognized him as a Liberal strategist. Some Conservative bloggers nevertheless claimed the incident proved the public broadcaster's Liberal bias.</p>
<p>Liberal insiders said the incident had no bearing on Sakamoto's departure.</p>
<p>Levine said he's returning to his law practice.</p>
<p>"It was a personal choice," Levine said in an email. "I'm happy to have worked with an exceptional team and am looking forward to helping out in other ways going forward."</p>
<p>The pair may be jumping before they're pushed.</p>
<p>Peter Donolo, one-time communications director for former prime minister Jean Chrétien, will be officially starting as Ignatieff's new chief of staff in 10 days and insiders say he's been given carte blanche to clean house.</p>
<p>Communications director Jill Fairbrother, Davey's partner, and principal secretary Dan Brock are considered prime targets.</p>
<p>Ignatieff has been under enormous pressure to shake up his inner circle since early September, when he declared his intention to defeat the Harper government at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>Liberal fortunes and Ignatieff's popularity have plunged since then, although they've shown signs of stabilizing in the past week.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Ontario hospitals that are allowing their board members to jump the queue for the H1N1 vaccine must stop the practice immediately, Health Minister Deb Matthews warned Friday.</p>
<p>Board members are not health-care workers and should not be given the shot unless they fall into one of the other five priority groups set out by the province, health officials added.</p>
<p>"It just isn't right that a six-year-old has to wait and someone else with better connections can go ahead," Matthews said. "It's not OK. I have said it as strongly as I can and I will continue to say it: the priority groups must be respected."</p>
<p>Members of at least four hospital boards in Toronto have been offered the H1N1 vaccine that's intended for priority groups only.</p>
<p>Board members at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital got the H1N1 shot last week and the University Health Network is offering the vaccine to its board and executives, along with nurses, doctors, volunteers and other hospital workers.</p>
<p>Health-care workers are among the six groups considered to be high priority for getting the shot in Ontario, and some hospital officials argue that board members fall into that group.</p>
<p>Everyone who works at the Toronto General, Toronto Western and Princess Margaret hospitals is being offered the H1N1 shot because they're all needed in a time of crisis, said Dr. Bob Bell, president of the University Health Network.</p>
<p>"Our analysis of the situation at University Health Network is that every individual who works in the hospital is essential to the hospital's functioning," Bell said. "And that includes our managers, our directors, our executives. Let's face it, we're making day-to-day decisions on how this hospital responds to this epidemic. Of all times, this is the time that hospital leadership is most necessary."</p>
<p>Others have held off. The Hospital for Sick Children has vaccinated 4,500 staff, including front-line health-care workers and other staff who work with patients, but has no plans to give the shot to its board members, said hospital spokesperson Matet Nebres.</p>
<p>Matthews and Premier Dalton McGuinty have both said they'll also wait their turn.</p>
<p>While health officials have urged people from the start to let the priority groups go first, they originally said no one would be turned away. That changed as demand surged and Ontario's supplies dwindled, prompting the province to restrict the shot to priority groups only late last week.</p>
<p>Tempers began to flare in recent days after several pro athletes were accused of jumping the queue - recriminations that have now spread to hospital officials and agencies that are supposed to enforcing the rules.</p>
<p>The Mount Sinai board, which includes several high-profile business leaders and former politicians, got special treatment and its chair Lawrence Bloomberg must resign, she added. Mount Sinai's chief microbiologist Dr. Donald Low, who is also medical director of Ontario's public health labs, expressed regret Friday that he offered the board the flu shot at an Oct. 26 board meeting, the first day it became available in Toronto.</p>
<p>Sixty-five people, including doctors, staff and volunteers as well as board members, got the shot, and 15 of them would have been in the high-priority category, he said.</p>

<p>LONDON</p>
<p>In Britain, there are no long lines of people seeking H1N1 vaccine. Doctor's offices aren't swamped with desperate calls. And there are no cries of injustice that the vaccine is going to wealthy or healthy people who don't really need it.</p>
<p>Here, and across most of Europe, vaccine to protect against the pandemic flu is mostly given by invitation only to those at highest risk for flu complications.</p>
<p>"That is one of the great advantages of the British health system," said Dr. Steve Field, president of the Royal College of General Physicians. "We have a list of all the names of patients who qualify to be vaccinated."</p>
<p>When Britain unrolled its pandemic vaccination program last month, it designed its campaign to ensure that priority groups - including pregnant women, health workers and those with chronic health problems like diabetes, cancer and AIDS - get the shots first.</p>
<p>Instead of advertising that vaccine had arrived and waiting for the lines to form, Britain's National Health Service sent letters, inviting all those who qualify to make an appointment and get the shots first.</p>
<p>Field said Britain's socialized health care system allows the country to target people who need to be vaccinated quickly: "It's not like the U.S., where it's the survival of the fittest and the richest."</p>
<p>Just this week, Americans learned that Wall Street giants <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> got H1N1 vaccine, even as many doctor's offices and community clinics still had none. The companies obtained the vaccine through standard procedures, and it was targeted to employees who met criteria for vaccination. But the perception of unfairness set off an outcry. In the United Kingdom, the general population will be offered the shot after priority groups have been taken care of, in about two months. For now, only children with health problems are a priority; healthy children are not.</p>
<p>Similar programs are being carried out in other European countries, all of which have socialized medicine:</p>
<p>In Germany, doctors have also been contacting high-priority patients to come in for their H1N1 shot, though other people who have asked for one have not been turned away.</p>
<p>In Sweden, Denmark and Finland, some local governments are sending invitations to people in high-risk groups.</p>
<p>So far, France is only vaccinating health care workers. Six million people in priority groups would start being vaccinated next week.</p>

<p>Have you heard of the Golden Poo Award?</p>
<p>It's not as prestigious as the Nobel Prize but now that the virus season is here, it's time to think about influenza and the H1N1 virus. And remember there's more to infection than these two diseases. That's why this award was recently presented to contestants who made outstanding contributions to hygiene and sanitation.</p>
<p>The award, sponsored by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, had one main message: People often don't wash their hands after using the toilet. The contest's goal was to motivate them to do so.</p>
<p>The school had good reason to reach its unappetizing conclusion. It reported a recent survey during which public washroom sinks were outfitted with sensors. It then monitored 250,000 people who used the facilities. This revealed that only 28 per cent of men washed their hands and women had only a slightly better track record.</p>
<p>So what did the winning contestant propose in an effort to improve hygiene? In the women's washroom an LED screen was inscribed with the question, "Is the person next to you washing with soap?"</p>
<p>In the men's washroom the message went right to the jugular, "Soap it off or eat it later." This motivated more men to scrub at the sink. Clever cartoon films also got the hand washing message across to children.</p>
<p>Dr. Val Curtis, director of hygiene at the school, said "We need to talk more about poo. It shouldn't be a taboo subject. Poor hygiene kills 5,000 children every day."</p>
<p>The importance of hand washing was proved to be life-saving 150 years ago by Dr. Semmelweiss in Vienna. He observed that one in six women died of infection after childbirth. He decided it was because doctors, following autopsies, often delivered babies without washing their hands. Once hand washing was adopted, the maternal death rate dropped. Experts say that only 40 per cent of hospital workers wash their hands. That's why each year an estimated 200,000 Canadians develop hospital infections and 8,000 die.</p>
<p>A few years ago the New Orleans Health Department stationed medical student spies in washrooms during a meeting of infectious disease specialists. Of 500 doctors using the facilities, only 69 per cent washed their hands. It's amazing how careless some people are about hand hygiene. How many times have you seen a person blow his or her nose, then offer to shake your hand?</p>
<p>Experts in the field stress that hand washing is the most important habit to prevent the spread of disease-causing germs. Often we hear people say, "I have a cold so I won't kiss you." But then they proceed to shake your hand. The best solution would be to follow the Japanese and just bow.</p>
<p>As seasonal influenza and H1N1 viruses now spread across the country, there is debate about the wisdom of taking these vaccines, particularly H1N1. But there should be no debate about hand washing.</p>
<p>So how much money did contest winners receive? The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine pooh-poohed the idea that money motivated contestants. Instead it created a golden statue. But it was a statuette of poo.</p>

</p>
<p>In 1932 my mother stood on the platform of the railwaystation of Trenton, Ont., the small city where she grew up. She had just finished high school. With her was a small beige and brown striped suit case. Toronto General Hospital had accepted her into its nursing program.</p>
<p>From then until 1980, when she retired, except for about 10 years when I was young, she worked in some capacity as a nurse. For the last 20 years of her career she was a public health nurse. You will forgive me, then, if I have a bias. Although I respect all health care professionals, I reserve my highest admiration for nurses. I don't think that I have ever met one who I did not respect.</p>
<p>Listening to my mother at the dinner table when I was young does not qualify me as a public health expert, but it did give me some insight in the problems of the public health world</p>
<p>Ontario has had an exemplary public health policy with regard to flu inoculations, one of the best in the world. It has tried to inoculate everyone. Like smallpox or polio or any other infectious disease, the more people who are inoculated, the fewer places there are for the virus to hide and then spread again. Smallpox has been eradicated and Rotary International in conjunction with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has reduced the prevalence of polio from 125 countries in the world in 1985 to four now. There are very few parents who would not get their children inoculated against mumps, or measles, or rubella.</p>
<p>Getting a flu shot as an individual dramatically decreases the chance that you will get the flu. Or, it is better to say, a flu, because there are many strains. It is not just one disease - like the cold is not just one disease, but an unpleasant runny nose, coughing kind of thing we don't much like to have that is caused by a number of related viruses.</p>
<p>The flu is like that too. The seasonal flu shot normally protects against three strains of the flu that public health officials forecast are likely to be prevalent. Flu viruses mutate in often unpredictable ways, so they aren't always right, but they are right more often than not.</p>
<p>This year they knew that there was a strain, H1N1, that was going the rounds. So they prepared a vaccine to inoculate against it. Although public health authorities originally feared that it might prove deadlier than the normal seasonal flu, they were relieved when they discovered that it was just merely nastier (as my wife can testify). It also caused exceptional harm to an unusual group, the healthy young, and caused less harm to the elderly.</p>
<p>They called the group that was unusually susceptible to this particular strain high risk. That group included small children, pregnant women and people with serious underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>They reserved the first doses of the vaccine for these and also for people such as health care workers. They were the priority groups. Not everyone can be vaccinated at the same time.</p>
<p>Overall, morbidity rate (the percentage of people who get the illness who die) from H1N1 is probably no higher than for other flus, but it is still a flu. You should not be asking yourself: Am I high risk? Whether you are high risk or low risk of serious complications from the flu, your chances of getting the flu is the same as anyone else's.</p>
<p>You probably won't die if you get the flu, but you will spend a miserable week in bed. Get inoculated and, after two weeks, there is a 90 per cent chance that you won't catch it.</p>
<p>Just as important, if you don't get the flu, you cannot pass it on to your family, your friends, your co-workers, or people you cough on at <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span>.</p>
<p>Once vaccination becomes available to the general public, you have three good reasons for getting inoculated: to avoid unnecessary misery, to help maintain a healthy community, and to say thank you to all the dedicated health care professionals like my mother, who believe that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>

<p>FERGUS</p>
<p>Groves Memorial Community Hospital has leapfrogged to the forefront of diagnostic imaging with Friday's launch of its new state-of-the-art $3-million CT scanner suite.</p>
<p>The hospital jumps to second from 13th out of 14 health districts in terms of patient wait times, Guelph MPP Liz Sandals said.</p>
<p>She was at the official launch in part because Groves in Fergus can now easily send images electronically to Guelph General Hospital radiologists for analysis.</p>
<p>Wellington-Halton Hills MPP Ted Arnott stressed rural patients will no longer have to travel to Guelph when Fergus is closer. The CT scanner is expected to serve 450 to 500 people a month in Centre and North Wellington.</p>
<p>"A vision has become a reality. Health care is getting better all the time here in Centre Wellington," Arnott told dozens of dignitaries and others gathered for the official launch of the CT suite, which sees its first patients Monday. It will boost patient satisfaction that's already high at Groves, he added.</p>
<p>The ceremony was held at a temporary tent set up near the rear of the hospital because of proactive visiting restrictions imposed in the face of the H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Those attending rubbed elbows - literally. It was welcomed as an alternative to shaking hands and possibly spreading the virus.</p>
<p>"They're not trying to check you like in hockey," hospital chief executive Jerome Quenneville said of the elbowing, as people burst into laughter.</p>
<p>"It's been a long road," he said, noting the project was first proposed in 2007 and required considerable fundraising, much of it through the hospital's 250-strong volunteer association.</p>
<p>"This is a great occasion," Quenneville said at Friday's ribbon-cutting.</p>
<p>Groves Hospital Foundation chair Jackie Ranahan said volunteers and donors have raised $1.7 million to date.</p>
<p>"That's a tremendous feat; we're not finished yet," she said. Friday's ceremonies included presentation of a $100,000 cheque from the volunteer association.</p>
<p>"I know it's a wonderful day for the good people here," said provincial Revenue Minister John Wilkinson, speaking on behalf of Health Minister Deb Matthews, who couldn't attend.</p>
<p>"She has a lot on her plate right now," Wilkinson said. Matthews is in the midst of rolling out a broad H1N1 vaccination program, which hasn't been without its glitches, including an anticipated vaccine shortage next week. The CT scanner represents fast and efficient diagnostic imaging, Wilkinson said.</p>
<p>It's the right service at the right place and time, said Kathy Durst, chair of the Waterloo-Wellington Local Health Integration Network, the regional health planning and funding body.</p>
<p>Hospital board chair Gord Feniak said that's why approval of the project "was a very easy decision to make."</p>
<p>It's important to stress diagnostic imaging for rural residents is now on a par with urban counterparts, North Wellington Health Care board chair Patti-Jo McLellan said.</p>
<p>"We're bringing quality care closer to home," she said.</p>

<p>Too many hockey players in Canada seem confused about who is entitled to be vaccinated against the H1N1 influenza. Indeed, NHL pros with the Calgary Flames and Toronto Maple Leafs have crassly elbowed their way to the head of the vaccination lines and received a preferential treatment that is entirely undeserved.</p>
<p>To set the record straight, this vaccine is still reserved for high-risk groups such as pregnant women, young children and people with underlying health issues. Last time we checked there are no pregnant women or young kids skating in the NHL, and few, if any, players with serious health problems. These big, tough offending pros should wait their turn – like everyone else with a conscience.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Nicholas Henry Klassen aspired to be prime minister of Canada. But he never got that chance.</p>
<p>At the age of 23, Klassen died in his sleep in the early hours of Oct. 27. He succumbed to complications from the onset of the H1N1 virus, said Dr. Nicola Mercer, medical officer of health for Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health.</p>
<p>Klassen is the first person in the Guelph area to die of the virus.</p>
<p>Klassen, who was born in North Bay, was a social science graduate of the University of Ottawa. He had recently moved to Edmonton to be with his girlfriend, Paige Atkinson, and his twin brother, Richard. He was in Guelph visiting his mother, Susan Klassen.</p>
<p>"He was a wonderful and caring individual," Susan said Friday in a phone interview.</p>
<p>"He had a lot of promise. He wanted to be the next prime minister of Canada."</p>
<p>Klassen's younger sister, Erin, wrote his obituary for the North Bay Nugget. She described him as "warm-hearted, intelligent, unfailingly considerate and widely admired for his sincerity and charm."</p>
<p>Klassen developed a cough Oct. 23. The following day, his fever spiked at 40.3 C. He and his mother went to Guelph General Hospital's emergency room.</p>
<p>Susan Klassen said her son had to fill out several medical and information forms because he was in the process of changing from Ontario to Alberta health-care coverage. She said her son was then seen by a triage nurse and his temperature had receded to 39.5 C, roughly 103 F.</p>
<p>"We should be at home and not spreading germs around - that was the general attitude we received at the Guelph General," Susan Klassen said. "They basically said that the fever wasn't high enough (for him) to even be there."</p>
<p>After waiting more than an hour without seeing a doctor, Klassen insisted he and his mom return home. They left the hospital "sometime before midnight."</p>
<p>"He was regarded as low priority. Things weren't moving and he was tired. He just wanted to go home," Susan Klassen said.</p>
<p>Guelph General Hospital's chief executive Richard Ernst said Friday hospital records show Klassen's wait time "was very brief."</p>
<p>Ernst said Klassen was triaged, registered and called in to be seen by a health care provider all within 17 minutes.</p>
<p>"Absolutely not," Susan Klassen said. "We sat right by the nurses' station and we were never called. We then told someone we were leaving. I even asked if there were exit papers we needed to sign."</p>
<p>Nicholas Klassen was scheduled to return home to Edmonton the next day, but his mother decided he was too ill to travel and rescheduled his flight.</p>
<p>She said his condition neither worsened nor improved after the trip to the emergency room.</p>
<p>"I considered going back to the hospital but he was somewhat reluctant to do that," she said.</p>
<p>She said she heard her son moving around at about midnight on Oct. 27. But when she went to check on him at 6:30 a.m., he was dead.</p>
<p>"I rescheduled his flight from Sunday so I could take care of him," Susan Klassen said between sobs. "You just assume someone's going to get better from something like this, like they have every time before. But this time, he just didn't get better."</p>
<p>Klassen was what doctors would consider obese, his mom said.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Health, serious obesity is considered a chronic condition. That would have put Klassen in a high- priority group for the H1N1 vaccination.</p>
<p>Susan Klassen felt Guelph General Hospital's ER staff weren't aware that her son's obesity put him at a higher risk of illness and death from the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"I do think the more information people have will be of help," Susan Klassen said. "I would like to see the front-line people at the hospital more knowledgeable about risk factors."</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Health, there are 11 underlying chronic conditions - including heart disease, asthma and diabetes - which elevate the risk of complications due to H1N1.</p>
<p>"Any risk is taken into consideration," said Eileen Bain, Guelph General's vice-president of patient services.</p>
<p>"I can't speak to that specific case because I don't know who was ahead of him. We see the most critical patients first. If they're growing sicker while they wait, they're encouraged to let the nurse know."</p>
<p>Bain said Guelph General Hospital's protocol is to have a registered nurse assess patients, including a respiratory evaluation. The nurse then assigns the patient a triage level.</p>
<p>"We have been seeing very, very high number of patients with flu symptoms," Bain said. "They're triaged and seen as anyone would be."</p>
<p>The hospital has opened a flu assessment centre on Delhi Street.</p>
<p>"That's an ideal place for patients to present their symptoms," Bain said.</p>
<p>"If people are unwell and not getting better, they need to come to emergency."</p>
<p>Susan Klassen said Nicholas had not been vaccinated against H1N1, but his twin brother, Richard, has been.</p>

</p>
<p>It appears that the Saskatchewan Roughriders are no longer flu-riddled.</p>
<p>Riders head coach Ken Miller said Friday that the team is healthier than it has been for two or three weeks heading into today's CFL game against the Calgary Stampeders at Mosaic Stadium.</p>
<p>None of the players missed practice this week due to the flu. Last week, the Riders had five players absent at times with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"We haven't had any new reports of the flu," Miller said. "We've had some reports about head colds but that's about it."</p>
<p>There have been some reports about some sports teams looking to jump ahead of civilians when it comes to being vaccinated for the H1N1 virus. There are concerns that athletes in a team setting</p>
<p>may be more susceptible to the flu strain because of their proximity to each other and the travel demands that may weaken some players. Miller doesn't feel that the Riders deserve special treatment.</p>
<p>"Those in need in the regular population should be first to get the vaccine," Miller said. "We should get it after those who need it most get theirs."</p>
<p>End over end</p>
<p>Miller met Friday morning with disgruntled defensive end Stevie Baggs to discuss the results of the first round of voting for the CFL's defensive player of the year award.</p>
<p>John Chick, who plays the other defensive end, was selected as the nominee by Miller and a panel representing the Football Reporters of Canada. Baggs said Thursday he was happy for Chick but wondered why he wasn't selected based on his superior statistics.</p>
<p>"I talked to him about being team-oriented and (Baggs) talked about being humble," said Miller. "Generally on a team there are individuals, some of whom are more transparent than others and some who might be more vocal. In every interview that he conducted, Stevie congratulated John before he talked about the things he had accomplished, like being the defensive player of the week three times and the player of the month. Those are reasons why he might have had reasonable expectations for being a strong candidate.</p>
<p>"Stevie understands that it's a team game and he's going to sublimate himself for the team. He won't be divisive in the locker-room."</p>
<p>College comeback</p>
<p>Roughriders quarterback Darian Durant wants to give tonight's game the ol' college try.</p>
<p>Tonight's West Division first-place showdown with Calgary reminds Durant of a big game he played at the University of North Carolina in 2004.</p>
<p>"We played Miami in my senior year," Durant remembered. "They were ranked No. 3 in the country. It was like Game 8 of the season. They were having national-championship talk and things like that. They came into Chapel Hill and we ended up beating them on the field goal with no time left. I led the team down on the last-second drive. If I had to relate this game to any big-time game that I've had, it would be that one."</p>

</p>
<p>J eff Funnekotter, on the big uproar this week as Flames players were among the first to receive H1N1 vaccinations: "No such problem in Toronto-- there's no way the Leafs would come close to first.''</p>
<p>- Bill Littlejohn, after Boston Bruins centre David Krejci was diagnosed with swine flu: "He reportedly asked to be taken to Calgary for speedy treatment.''</p>
<p>-One more on the same topic, this one from Derek Wilken: "Professional athletes have been called pigs for years, but when they try to get a shot for it everyone calls them line jumpers.''</p>
<p>- R.J. Currie, after Andre Agassi claimed he lost the 1990 French Open final because he was wearing a hairpiece and was concerned about accidentally ripping it off: "That's got to be the worst excuse ever; he lost because he was afraid of having the rug pulled out from over him?''</p>
<p>-An estimated 700 million people worldwide would like to move to a different country, according to a Gallup poll. Wouldn't it be wonderful if one of those wanting to live in Canada was Alexander Ovechkin?</p>
<p>- Janice Hough, after Kobe Bryant played earlier this week for the Los Angeles Lakers against the Oklahoma City Thunder despite flu-like symptoms: "Apparently neither team was worried about H1N1, figuring, it's Kobe, he never passes on anything.''</p>
<p>-The perfect scenario for Alex Rodriguez's much-discussed World Series home run would have had the ball hitting a camera brought to the game by Jeffrey Maier and landing in the hands of Steve Bartman.</p>
<p>- Kate Hudson was so upset that A-Rod wasn't named the World Series MVP that she is dating Hideki Matsui.</p>
<p>- Bill Littlejohn, after Joe Girardi stopped to help out at a car crash scene on the way home from winning the World Series: "This is no surprise; after all, Girardi helped clean up the Rodriguez train wreck."</p>
<p>-Vancouver comic Torben Rolfsen, on the movie The Men Who Stare At Goats</p>
<p>opening this weekend: "Finally, a documentary on Bill Buckner and the 1986 World Series.''</p>
<p>-It is now alleged Oakland Raiders coach Tom Cable assaulted two women. Why can't he be like everyone else and stick to beating up assistant coaches?</p>
<p>-One of the most interesting places I visited in Philadelphia was Carpenters' Hall. It is famous as being the building where, in 1774, colonial leaders met just before the American Revolution to condemn the actions of the British. Among those at this historic meeting were Patrick Henry, John and Sam Adams, and Chris Chelios.</p>
<p>-If Carpenters' Hall had been built in Saskatoon, it would have been demolished for a parking lot.</p>
<p>-Currie, after reality TV star Kim Kardashian took part in a charity boxing match and got a shiner: "Reports say she is a sight for sore eyes.''</p>
<p>- Stephen Colbert's TV show is now the primary sponsor of U.S. speed skating. Here are three other possible sponsorship deals:</p>
<p>3. David Letterman, a college intern program; 2. Plaxico Burress, trap shooting;</p>
<p>1. the Calgary Flames, the H1N1 rollout.</p>
<p>-One Toronto report would have us believe Steve Yzerman</p>
<p>was in Hogtown this week to scout Vincent Lecavalier, Martin St. Louis, Steve Stamkos and Francois Beauchemin. Which one doesn't belong?</p>
<p>-Currie, when asked how many Maple Leafs jokes he thought were out there: "No more than five, plus a goalie."</p>
<p>-It's not shocking that broadcaster Jim Nantz has to pay his ex-wife $1 million per year as part of their divorce settlement or that she was awarded their six-bedroom house or that he has a 29-year-old girlfriend. What shocked me is he makes $7 million a year. To put that in perspective, that's the kind of bread the backup catcher for the Yankees makes.</p>
<p>-The Columbus Blue Jackets are losing $12 million US a season, according to numbers released by the Columbus Chamber. Only $12 million; isn't this what Gary Bettman calls a model NHL franchise?</p>
<p>-When I got to my room at a Reading, Pa., hotel last weekend, the first thing I noticed was tissue jammed into the peep hole. I thought this is cool; I've got the Erin Andrews suite. I took the tissue out and tossed it into the garbage. I figure if somebody wants to shoot nude video of me, well, go for it.</p>

<p>Black Dogs Blue Giants Jeff Stuart & the Hearts (Independent)</p>
<p>Rating 4 1/2</p>
<p>Alt-country might be the starting point for the Hearts, but only in an allusive way, almost as if they decided to reconstruct the genre after hearing about it rather than actually hearing it. They're baroque rather than barroom, enamoured of tricky musical arrangements and elliptical lyrics ( Wrong I Guess), shoegazers that sometimes like to stomp. Brian Wilson would appreciate the vocal harmonies, Charlie Rich would nod appreciatively at Stuart's existential weariness; call them what you will, I'm calling them for the year-end Top 10 list. Jeff Stuart and the Hearts perform Tuesday at The Pawn Shop on Whyte Avenue. Showtime:9p.m. Tix are $15 at the door.</p>
<p>Tom Murray, Edmonton Journal</p>
<p>Mastrzofthayoonavrce Citizen and Critical Mass (Independent)</p>
<p>Rating 2 1/2</p>
<p>Local MC Citizen and Saskatchewan producer Critical Mass are masters of their universe --their first collaboration is a collage of woozy melodies, jazzy beats, news clips, vinyl scratches, and rhymes about love, mathematics and the need for social change. mastrzofthayoonavrce feels both retro and futuristic--like an old transistor radio spitting out 100-year-old messages to the citizens of a bleak and repressive world in 2109. "I'm trying to introduce the kids to a new existence," Citizen raps on Raise the State. "Because we must admit this sophisticated system / Isn't what we think it is." Logic, with its paranoid news clips about bankers, 9/11 and swine flu, is particularly relevant to our times. "I find that whenever I get the flu shot, I end up getting sick," says a young man's voice. Disappointed Like So Many Dreams feels like a bittersweet Prince-like ode to the power of music in the face of "total annihilation." The album's only disappointment? At 16 tracks, Mastrzofthayoonavrce drags on a bit too long and loses its potency by the end of its 64-plus minutes. Citizen and Critical Mass will perform Friday at The ARTery, 9535 Jasper Ave. Doors open at 8 p.m. Tix are $10.</p>

<p>Exploding Head A Place to Bury Strangers (Mute)</p>
<p>Rating 4</p>
<p>With an album title referring to the Canadian horror classic, Scanners, A Place to Bury Strangers takes elements of noise, shoegaze and experimental pop to produce one of the best--and loudest--rock releases of the year. While remaining true to their previous effort, the Brooklyn musicians exercise more pop sensibilities on Exploding Head. APTBS takes a page out of the My Bloody Valentine songbook, while evoking contemporaries such as The Cure with their dark ominous tones. The wall-of-sound production throughout this stellar release further cements APTBS's place within the world of garage and indie rock.</p>
<p>Taz Dhariwal, Edmonton Journal</p>
<p>Power Boys Noize (Boys Noize)</p>
<p>Rating 4</p>
<p>Has bloghouse come full circle? Has the backlash against hipster techno reached an apex?Will the hippest of kids continue to embrace distorted synth riffs and fuzzy hi-hats? Germany's Boys Noize, a leading vanguard among the seemingly thousands of new electro producers, has taken his signature glitch electro sound and given melody a little more time in the limelight this time around. Don't get it twisted, this album brings the electro stompers en masse, but without any of the repetitiveness of his lesser-educated peers. One of the best electronic releases of the year, Boys Noize does have Power.</p>
<p>Taz Dhariwal, Edmonton Journal</p>
<p>Between My Head and the Sky Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band (Chimera)</p>
<p>Rating 4</p>
<p>Few women have caught more flak for loving their men than Yoko Ono, especially when you consider the widow Lennon's esthetic pedigree. Ono has long been prominent as artist and collaborator in the international avant-garde, made worthy stabs into electro dance music during the last decade, and has been an icon to noisemakers and No Wavers. Still, critics turn a jaundiced ear. Now, at 76, Ono may have her best and most fully realized work. With son Sean Lennon, Japan's "Cornelius" Oyamada, and NYC jazz improvisers Erik Friedlander and Daniel Carter, Ono takes on ruminations over her own death with dark humour (the discordant funk of Waiting for the D Train), as well as themes such as decaying elegance ( I'm Going Away Smiling) and the passing of young friends on the precious, haunting ballad Memory of Footsteps. The bass-heavy The Sun Is Down and the snarling, psychedelic Calling benefit from her raw but clarion call, as does all of Head's primal, jazzy roar of saxophones and guitar. Pushing herself to sing in tones more roughly expressive and beautiful than ever, Ono becomes one with the music in a way she hasn't since the cracked blues of the initial Plastic Ono Band recordings of 1970.</p>
<p>A.D. Amorosi, Philadelphia Inquirer</p>
<p>Here Waits Thy Doom 3 Inches of Blood</p>
<p>(Roadrunner)</p>
<p>Rating 4</p>
<p>Battles! Brotherhood! Preachers' daughters! 3 Inches of Blood's Here Waits Thy Doom has it all, and it delivers it in ear-shredding power metal glory. Vocalist Cam Pipes has one of the funniest voices in modern metal--his high pitched falsetto is hard to take seriously--but it couldn't fit in with the Vancouver band's distinctive style any better. The album's opening track, Battles and Brotherhood, conjures up images of Viking marauders storming across an idyllic medieval field. What could possibly set the tone for a power metal album better than that?Lovers of classic metal will be delighted by Rock in Hell, a classic rock-inspired tune made for fist pumping. As a whole, the songs on the album flow together smoothly without losing momentum. Here Waits Thy Doom is a great example of modern metal that still stays true to the genre's roots.</p>
<p>Codie McLachlan, Edmonton Journal</p>
<p>Prior to the Fire Priestess (Indica) - - - - 1/2</p>
<p>Montreal's premier heavy metal act takes it up a notch on its second album. The followup to 2005's Hello Master, this 11-song set was recorded in L.A. and produced by Dave Schiffman (System Of a Down, Nine Inch Nails, Mars Volta). "Keep your voices quiet / ears are all around," Mikey Heppner wails, over raunchy guitars and a very fat beat on The Firebird. Fast, furious and relentless is the way this band rolls. But it's not all punishment. Thick grooves, strong melodies, complex arrangements and a classic rock sensibility -- not to mention stellar musicianship -- underlie every song. Priestess sounds like the mammoth metal acts of yore, with the hunger of a young band out to make an indelible mark on the present. Priestess performs Saturday, Nov. 28 at the Starlite Room. Tickets are $17.50 plus service charges at <span class="companylink">Ticketmaster</span>.</p>
<p>T'Cha Dunlevy, Montreal Gazette</p>
<p>Plain Jane Chantal Kreviazuk (MapleMusic)</p>
<p>Rating 3 1/2</p>
<p>Chantal Kreviazuk is often taken for granted, but nothing draws attention to your strengths like a foray out of your comfort zone. Plain Jane's smooth-jazz title track (featuring Chris Botti) and Half of Me's glossy R&B are new territory for Kreviazuk, and both are worth more than mere curiosity value. But both also sound like genre experiments when placed next to some of her most effortlessly melodic pop. Say the Word and Halfway Around the World are as empathetic as anything she has written, and The Way's galvanizing chorus might be her single greatest spinetingler. There are a few wonky moments -- not the least being some rushed vocal phrasing on Invincible -- but this is Kreviazuk's most satisfying work since 1999's Colour Moving and Still.</p>
<p>Jordan Zivitz, Montreal Gazette</p>
<p>Let Freedom Ring! Chuck Prophet (Yep Roc)</p>
<p>Rating 3 1/2</p>
<p>It sounds like a collection of disasters that could befall a character from one of his songs: When Chuck Prophet went to Mexico City to make this record, he encountered a pandemic, an earthquake and an antiquated studio. But with the grit and resilience that have typified his work since his days in Green on Red, Prophet soldiered through. The result is Let Freedom Ring!, another solid collection of his sturdy, rootsy rock 'n' roll. Prophet is a storyteller with a sharp eye for detail and a deft sense of character. His ninth solo album nods to Bob Dylan ( Hot Talk, You and Me Baby), Randy Newman ( Barely Exist), and John Mellencamp( American Man), with a bit of Texas roadhouse blues thrown in ( Where the Hell Is Henry?) It doesn't delve quite as deeply as The Hurting Business or Soap&Water, but as always, Prophet's stories ring true.</p>
<p>Steve Klinge, Philadelphia Inquirer</p>
<p>Soulbook Rod Stewart (<span class="companylink">Sony</span> BMG)</p>
<p>Rating 2</p>
<p>Why mess with a proven formula?Rod Stewart follows the success of his Great American Songbook series with this batch of soul remakes. "A sentimental fool am I," he sings, on It's the Same Old Song, "to hear an old love song and want to cry." He's faithful to a fault to the originals, as he makes his way through Stevie Wonder's My Cherie Amour (featuring Wonder on harmonica) and other classics such as Tracks of My Tears, You've Really Got a Hold On Me, Wonderful World and Just My Imagination.</p>
<p>Also on the guest list are Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Hudson and Smokey Robinson--none of them enough to bring these songs to life. That said, your mom will love it.</p>

<p>- Definition of happiness: Seeing three junior high school boys skipping along a grassy boulevard. They reminded me of Snoopy doing his happy dance. - A well deserved toast belongs to every frontline health-care worker who has helped vaccinate Albertans for the H1N1 virus over the past two weeks. Under thankless conditions, these people make me proud to be an Albertan. - A sincere thanks to RBC and Fresh&Co in Rutherford for providing coffee and a place to warm up on Saturday. Those of us standing in line for the H1N1 vaccine really appreciated it. - Maria Stubel must be the most awesome 101-year-old in the history of the world and she's still going strong, knitting hats to give away. It goes to show what having a purpose can do for you. - I'd love to give kudos to the two groups that are studying the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in the hope of perhaps eliminating it one day. Good for them. Their efforts will be good for our planet and its marine life.</p>

<p>Red noses, red ribbons and red flashing police lights await partygoers this upcoming holiday season, sober-driving advocates say.</p>
<p>The annual end-of-year Checkstop campaign got underway Thursday night with a bit of good news: Officers found no impaired drivers among the 125 vehicles they checked.</p>
<p>In 2008, Checkstops and other enforcement activities resulted in impaired driving charges against 2,130 people.</p>
<p>As a way of encouraging revellers to get home safely, Operation Red Nose organizers on Friday announced their plans for the holiday season. The service, in which volunteers transport people home in their own cars, will be offered from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. on Nov. 27 and 28, Dec. 11, 12, 18, 19, 26, 27 and 31.</p>
<p>"The biggest night for us is New Year's Eve, but we're also working the corporate Christmas party circuit," said Lacey Untereiner of the Spirit Keeper Youth Society, which is organizing the service this year. "We are trying to get the word out to banquet halls and restaurants and bars that have those parties."</p>
<p>Untereiner said Operation Red Nose is in need of volunteers. About 70 are currently signed up, but she believes at least 200 will be required to field all the calls. Last year, the service gave about 550 rides through the holiday season. Interested volunteers should call 780-428-9299 as soon as possible because they must go through a security check.</p>
<p>Rides are free, but volunteers accept donations that go to the youth society, which administers programs for native people.</p>
<p>It's unclear how busy the Checkstops and Operation Red Nose will be this year because Christmas party bookings are down, said Cliff Higuchi, assistant general manager at the Shaw Conference Centre.</p>
<p>This year, the Shaw has taken orders for 36 parties expected to serve about 12,000 people through late November and December. Those numbers represent a small drop from 2008.For example, a children's party was dropped due to fear of H1N1 flu spreading, while other cancellations are due to the weak economy.</p>
<p>"We have seen some of our regular parties cancelled," Higuchi said. "Some companies had to layoff people this year and felt that having a Christmas party wouldn't be perceived well."</p>
<p>Higuchi said the Shaw provides information to discourage drunk driving.</p>
<p>Also this week, Mothers Against Drunk Driving launched its red ribbon campaign, in which people are encouraged to purchase or donate a ribbon to honour victims of drunk drivers.</p>
<p>The ribbons can be displayed on key chains or a car antenna.</p>

<p>- Why is it that waiting in line for 10 to 12 hours for a Boxing Day sale is an adventure, but waiting in line for five to six hours for a flu shot is a travesty? - I hate it when the television shows babies getting needles. It makes me feel ill. - Alberta Health Services reminds me of the old Soviet Union: Inefficient, ineffective central planning and access to services based on personal relationships with the commissars. - I am sick of hearing about the H1N1 fiasco. What about Lucy the elephant? - Get a grip, people. Jarome Iginla did not bodycheck a pregnant woman and snatch her vaccine. He and the rest of the Flames were simply following the medical orders of their employer. - What do you bet they found which bureaucrat OK'd the shots for the Flames...and then fired his assistant?</p>
<p> - If all this hype about H1N1 actually gets people washing their hands, covering their mouths when they sneeze or cough, and staying home when they're sick, it will be the most significant improvement in public health in 100 years. - I know I've been exposed to the H1N1 virus but I can't get upset with my co-worker for coming in sick. We don't get sick days. We have only our vacation pay we can use. Unfortunately, customers still want their orders on time. - If you've come down with H1N1, remember your 10th-grade science class. Getting the vaccination now is a waste of time. Your body is already making its own antibodies. Make room in line for someone else. - If the government stalls long enough, most of the people will get sick, recover, and then it won't have to worry about giving out the vaccine anymore. - I guess that old buck will float around the legislature for years to come. No one seems inclined to let it stop near their desk. - So a venter wants all working Albertans to call in sick for a few days to get the politicians' attention. Obviously, this person has never owned or been responsible for a business. - Edmonton police should have been one of the first to be inoculated and the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party the last. - As long as Ed Stelmach keeps Ron Liepert in cabinet, it proves how gullible he is. Stelmach deserves to be replaced. - Only in Alberta can a conservative party screw up for decades and only start to lose support when an even more conservative option comes along. - All this mishmash over the vaccines would not have happened if people had elected the Liberals or the NDP instead. - The biggest challenge of the Tory leadership review will be to tell Ed he is failing miserably while telling Albertans Ed is the greatest leader ever. - As an octogenarian, few things frighten me anymore, including the H1N1 virus. The only thing that scares me now is when my wife says, "You know, I've been thinking ... ." - A salute to the Liberal and NDP MPs who refused to be constrained by their respective parties, listened to their constituents and voted to bring down the costly, ineffective gun registry. Such bold democracy is rare in Canadian politics. - Weakening the national firearms registry would have made James Roszko smile. - It's nice that police can check gun registries when they're at a standoff. - John Crosbie showed a lot of gall to wear a sealskin coat in front of the royals in St. John's. They are supporters of the environment. - A big-box store is already playing Christmas music. Why can't retailers wait until the end of November before doing that stuff? - I read in Venting about the man who asked the woman who was not pregnant when she was due. My rule is this: never imply a woman is pregnant unless you can actually see the baby leaving the birth canal.</p>

</p>
<p>This is Alberta. We are Albertans --a people who pride ourselves on our collective work ethic.</p>
<p>We work hard when we're healthy. And we work hard when we're ill.</p>
<p>In Alberta, there's always been a tacit cultural consensus that sick days are for wimps and losers. The unwritten rules of the Alberta workplace-- and the Alberta schoolyard -- are clear. You show up when you've got a cold. You show up when you've got a fever. Unless you're actually hemorrhaging or projectile vomiting, you report in.</p>
<p>A cough?A sore throat?A sniffle? Humbug. We learn from earliest childhood to put on a game face and work through our aches and pains. So what if we infect our colleagues, our classmates, our customers, our clients?</p>
<p>We're Albertans, and we tough things out.</p>
<p>Well, those were the rules. Until the advent of H1N1, that is. Suddenly, all you have to do is mention that you have a scratchy throat, or that you feel a bit achy, and your bosses and co-workers are practically pushing you out the door. Call in to tell your supervisor you've got a fever, and you now can expect up to seven guilt-free days off.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you cough or blow your nose on the job, or out in public, and you're no longer a stoic hero--you're a social pariah. Whereas we used to admire and praise those who left their sick beds, dosed themselves with Advil, and went about their business, we now view them as epidemiological menaces, 21st-century lepers, whose careless disregard for community health is little short of criminal.</p>
<p>It is, too be sure, a slightly hysterical overreaction to the current influenza outbreak.</p>
<p>(It's just one of many, of course. If I have to read one more poster or hear one more lecture telling me how to wash my hands or stifle a cough with my elbow, I may go screaming into the street--or try to drown my sorrows by drinking hand sanitizer straight from one of the pumps on the office wall.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, or so I've been told, when you smelled alcohol in a newsroom, it was because some grizzled old reporter had a mickey of rye in his desk drawer. Now our whole office is redolent of the boozy scent of Purcell.</p>
<p>Which is not to say I don't have my own semi-irrational virus-busting talismans and fetishes. I've taken to popping Cold F-X capsules for breakfast, and wearing leather gloves whenever I hit the bank machine or the grocery store, all in the superstitious hope that such tactics will ward off swine flu the way garlic and crucifixes ward off vampires.)</p>
<p>Still, in the long run, this new social model, which finally gives us permission to be sick, may do us all some good.</p>
<p>Our traditional culture of mass martyrdom has always been quite unhealthy.</p>
<p>It was easy enough to understand, especially two or three years ago, when our economy was in mad manic boom mode, and every employer was short staffed. And I suppose it's still easy enough to understand now, in these days of downsizing, when we know that when we stay home, we increase the workload for our peers, and put our own jobs at risk.</p>
<p>But really, has it ever made sense for us to drag ourselves into work when we're sick?</p>
<p>Or to send our kids to school or music lessons or hockey practice when they're unwell?</p>
<p>Yet so many of us do it-whether we're trying to prove how tough we are, trying to prove what responsible parents we are, or just trying to hang onto our jobs.</p>
<p>It would be nice to imagine this pandemic might force us all to re-evaluate our attitude toward working sick, especially when we've come down with something contagious. But old habits don't die easily. When this influenza outbreak passes, will we simply revert to our traditional machismo? Or will we keep giving our employees, our kids, and ourselves the social sanction to be sick when we're sick?</p>
<p>If only common sense were as catching as the flu. Perhaps then we'd stop oscillating between under-reaction and overreaction, and find a happy medium that preserved</p>
<p>our physical health-and our mental health too. I thought it would happen when pigs fly. But maybe it will be when swine flew.</p>

<p>Re: "Wrongly fanning the Flames," Editorial, and "Parents of sick kids need flu shots," Valerie Fortney, Opinion, Nov. 5.</p>
<p>I am shocked and disappointed that the Herald's editorial board would defend giving the Flames, their families and others in the club the H1N1 vaccinations before other high-risk groups got theirs. If people in their 20s, 30s and 40s are at greater risk, why are they not one of the high-risk groups according to the WHO and federal/ provincial health departments? The fact they meet many people should not put them at the head of the line. Police officers, firefighters and bus drivers are equally exposed to the public, yet these groups were not moved to the front. Valerie Fortney knows of some healthy adults who deserve to go to the front of the line far more than hockey players.</p>
<p>Let the Flames have their own clinic, but only when the high-risk groups had been served. I am in favour of large companies having their own clinics as well. Let's include seniors' residences, schools, etc. because making the vaccine available at mass clinics was a major public health blunder. I do not blame the Flames organization. I blame Alberta Health Services for having one set of rules for the public and another for a select group.</p>

<p>Re: "More backup," Editorial Nov. 5.</p>
<p>I am writing to correct the misinformation in your editorial. The Harper Conservatives have had four years to put in place an effective pandemic plan. A closer look at the facts puts their failure to adequately prepare the supply and quick distribution of H1N1 flu vaccine into proper perspective. Jean Chretien's Liberal government built up Canada's domestic capacity to make it possible to produce sufficient pandemic influenza vaccine. The 2001 pandemic vaccine contract with Shire Biologics (later acquired by GlaxoSmith-Kline) still allowed vaccines to be ordered from other manufacturers in case of a tight supply. The 2004 Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan clearly stated, "Multiple suppliers should be considered in the planning process."</p>
<p>Canada's auditor general has found that the Conservative government failed to prepare for an impending pandemic. They have not allocated the $400 million set aside for pandemic response in the 2006 budget, which could have been used to speed up vaccine delivery by funding school-based clinics to vaccinate children, fund additional clinics, and get the shots into the hands of family doctors for their high-risk patients.</p>
<p>The Harper Conservatives decided to order two different vaccines from one company with one plant and only one manufacturing line. The decision to order the second vaccine from the same company meant the company had to stop mass-producing adjuvanted vaccine, and is directly responsible for the shortages we've experienced this week. For the Conservatives to blame the previous government only heightens the national disgrace of their mishandling of this pandemic.</p>

</p>
<p>First it was hockey players. Now, wealthy hospital donors have jumped the queue to get H1N1 flu shots.</p>
<p>On Friday, news emerged that the top 200 donors at Montreal's Jewish General Hospital have already been inoculated. Meanwhile, board members of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital were offered H1N1 flu shots at a regularly scheduled board of governors meeting Oct. 26, says the union representing 46,000 healthcare workers in Ontario.</p>
<p>"The message this is sending is that the wealthy and influential should be treated first," said Pat Chastang, a spokeswoman for the Service Employees International Union Local 1 Canada, "even if it means pregnant women and children must be made to wait."</p>
<p>A statement from the hospital said the vaccinations were given during a clinic that was open to the general public during a time where no shortages had been announced.</p>
<p>"The focus was on inoculating health-care workers, patients, and any member of the public who requested the vaccine. No one would be turned away; it was understood there was sufficient vaccine available," said the statement on Mount Sinai's website.</p>
<p>In Montreal, a spokeswoman for the Jewish General Hospital said all 200 donors who received H1N1 shots serve as volunteers in some capacity.</p>
<p>"It has nothing to do with the fact that they gave money," said Karen Ohayon. "There's absolutely no link."</p>
<p>However, Marie-Eve Bedard, press attache to Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc, said board members of hospitals and donors are not entitled to vaccines ahead of the rest of the population.</p>
<p>"There has been a gap in communication, because this morning we learned that certain (hospital) boards of directors were vaccinated, which the minister considers unacceptable," Bedard said.</p>

<p>A lberta government employees will be asked to swear oaths declaring they were sick if they miss work for an extended period due to the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Most employees were told this week they would need the legal declarations, sworn in front of a commissioner of oaths, if they are absent more than three consecutive days.</p>
<p>The policy is meant to ease the pressure on family doctors by removing the need for medical notes during the outbreak, said government spokesman Gerald Kastendieck.</p>
<p>"It's not something they need to do the minute they come back or anything," said Kastendieck, who works in corporate human resources.</p>
<p>"They can go to their HR person, say, 'OK, I was away for however many days beyond the three, how do I get this addressed?' "</p>
<p>Kastendieck said most government agencies have commissioners of oaths working for them already, and no employees will be asked to pay to have their declaration done.</p>
<p>"The idea is not that your supervisor doesn't believe you or anything like that," he said.</p>
<p>Alberta's chief medical officer asked employers across the province to relax their rules on doctor's notes during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Some organizations, such as the University of Alberta, have already waived the requirement.</p>
<p>Others, such as the Edmonton Public School Board, have relaxed their rules by expanding the number of days employees can be absent without a note.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Eligibility for shots expanded; Families with babies under six months old to choose two caregivers</b>
</div><div>Jodie Sinnema   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>938 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Two more groups will be eligible to get H1N1 vaccinations starting on Tuesday as the province, yet to hit the peak of the pandemic's second wave, expects to see more deaths and a growing number of hospitalizations.</p>
<p>Families with babies under six months old will have to choose two caregivers who will be eligible for the shots: two parents, for example, or one parent and a caregiver. The babies themselves can't be immunized, but risk becoming dangerously ill if their parents bring the virus home.</p>
<p>"We'll have to ask the collaboration of those families to select two of the most important caregivers for the babies and make a choice," said Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Children under the age of 10 who have certain chronic illnesses can also come forward for their vaccinations starting Nov. 10.</p>
<p>"The vaccine supply issue that we're facing is forcing us to make some very difficult decisions, probably some of the most difficult that I have had to make in my career," Corriveau said. "If it was up to us, we would be providing vaccine to everyone who wants it immediately, but we have to face reality that we're dealing with the supply that is coming in one bit at a time."</p>
<p>Alberta first offered the vaccine to everyone starting Oct. 26, but when the manufacturer slowed production just as mass clinics were inundated with people, the province closed the clinics for four days to regroup.</p>
<p>On Thursday, when the clinics reopened, 35,000 children older than six months and under five years old were immunized. Pregnant women lined up on Friday.</p>
<p>"We view that as quite a success, to get 35,000 vaccinated on one day," said Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services. "We do have to make our decisions based on the greatest good for the greatest number, and that's what we're trying to do."</p>
<p>Corriveau said Alberta expects to receive another 237,000 doses next week. Even if that number doesn't come through, there is still enough vaccine left to allow nurses to give half-doses to an estimated 10,000 children under 10 who have conditions such as diabetes. Not all chronic health problems put children more at risk, so details on which conditions will make children eligible will be released Monday. Children currently in hospital will also get the shots.</p>
<p>Another 46,000 parents or caregivers of about 23,000 babies under six months old can also come forward.</p>
<p>All 20 people who have died in Alberta to date were adults, including two men from the Edmonton area whose deaths were announced Friday. Still, Predy said kids are most at risk of needing hospitalization.</p>
<p>While the actual number of children hospitalized has been fewer than adults--91 children under nine as of Nov. 2, compared to 104 people between 25 and 44, and 120 between 45 and 64--the rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 show that the younger the kids, the higher their risk of needing intensive care.</p>
<p>If the province decided to target older adults with chronic health conditions, the huge number would overwhelm the limited vaccine supply, Corriveau said.</p>
<p>As more vaccine arrives, more high-risk groups will become eligible.</p>
<p>On Friday, 41 more people were hospitalized with flu symptoms, bringing the provincial total to 490.</p>
<p>Roger Palmer, a business professor at the University of Alberta, said Alberta should from the start have rolled out the vaccination campaign to at-risk people first.</p>
<p>"If this had been an avian flu with the sort of death rates that produced, then this (throwing the doors open to everyone, even the healthy)would have been a very serious mistake," said Palmer, a former deputy health minister with Alberta Health and Wellness, and former dean of the U of A's School of Public Health.</p>
<p>Health officials said more deaths are expected in the coming days.</p>
<p>"I don't think we're at the peak of this second wave," Corriveau said.</p>
<p>For people who can't get their vaccination and begin to feel ill, Corriveau said they can ask for Tamiflu treatment from their doctors. Close to six million Tamiflu orders are available across Alberta, and doctors are prescribing 3,000 each day. If the pill is taken quickly, it can shorten the sickness and prevent complications.</p>
<p>People don't need to go to their family doctors to get the prescription. They can phone their doctors, who can then phone the prescription to a pharmacist.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Parents and caregivers of infants under six months old don't need to take the babies with them to the immunization clinic, but if caregivers come alone, they will need photo ID and a letter from the parent or guardian confirming their role. All parents and caregivers also need to provide proof of their infant's age, such as a birth certificate or healthcare card.</p>
<p>Children must be under the age of 10 as of Nov. 1, and have underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk of severe illness related to influenza. They will need proof of age, plus a prescription or other medical record indicating their medical condition.</p>
<p>A list of relevant health conditions will be made public Monday.</p>

</p>
<p>Months of speculation will come to a head tonight, when Premier Ed Stelmach's own party tells him whether he should stay or go.</p>
<p>On the surface, it looks good for the man some call "Steady Eddie." He's the first to note that just last year he delivered the biggest majority of any first-time premier when he won 72 of 83 seats in the legislature.</p>
<p>His ministers and MLAs insist rumours of trouble for Stelmach are little more than media hype. The premier can expect a solid mandate from the 1,300 or so Progressive Conservative party members casting ballots today, they say. Each MLA comes to this weekend's party convention in Red Deer with as many as 15 delegates from home, all of whom should have been urged to support Stelmach.</p>
<p>"They certainly know my position and that means that they should follow suit," Lesser Slave Lake MLA Pearl Calahasen said of her delegates.</p>
<p>"They have their own minds, but you do your best."</p>
<p>And there's the rub for Stelmach. There's no way to know how every delegate will vote, no way to know whether MLAs can deliver delegates.</p>
<p>"I've heard many different people speculate on the outcome of this weekend," said Bruce Cameron, a Calgary-based pollster. "It's so volatile."</p>
<p>In the past month, three different polls showed public support for the Tories slipping as interest in the right-wing Wildrose Alliance party grew.</p>
<p>The poor showing in the polls can be blamed on any number of things: a provincial economy that fell from a massive surplus to massive deficit in less than a year;new laws on land ownership and electricity transmission that riled rural residents; still-simmering anger over Stelmach's revamped oil royalties structure; and, making headlines all last week, long lineups and mixed messages on the province's delivery of H1N1 flu vaccinations.</p>
<p>Then there was the Calgary byelection loss in September to the Wildrose's Paul Hinman, whose campaign slogan was, "Send Ed a message."</p>
<p>What Tories may realize, Cameron said, is poll numbers "get so low that the credibility and the trust in the brand is weakened."</p>
<p>On Friday night, Stelmach delivered a plea to party delegates for confidence and unity.</p>
<p>"It's a competitive world out there. And that reminds us that we need to work together as a team," Stelmach said.</p>
<p>"As a family, I (have learned) that you can always accomplish more together than as individuals.</p>
<p>"We've always demonstrated that as a party. Just as premiers (Peter) Lougheed, (Don)Getty and(Ralph) Klein went through some difficult times, Conservatives battle through ... together."</p>
<p>At the end of his time onstage at the Capri Hotel, as Tories prepared to head into a night of partying, Stelmach pleaded for their support.</p>
<p>Just last month, former premier Klein has said Stelmach needs at least 70-per-cent support from party members to carry on.</p>
<p>Klein stepped down after winning 55 per cent in 2006.</p>
<p>But Lethbridge College political scientist Faron Ellis, who has a Wildrose Alliance membership, said Stelmach needs a lot of support. Low support, he said, looks like panic.</p>
<p>"The party really should rally around him," he said.</p>
<p>There may not be certainty about the vote, but there also isn't a "lightning rod" for dissent, Ellis said.</p>
<p>There may be people ready to take Stelmach's job, but they are not going public.</p>
<p>"The last thing the party needs, is whatever divisions they have, someone bringing those out into the public," Ellis said.</p>
<p>But in recent weeks, divisions have come to light.</p>
<p>Former Bonnyville MLA Ernie Isley has suggested the best thing that could happen to the upstart Wildrose Alliance is to see Stelmach continue as premier.</p>

</div><div>Liz Nicholls   </div>

</p>
<p>Edmonton theatre, and by extension the theatre community across the country, has lost one of its most magnetic and inspirational artists, teachers, mentors, agents provocateur.</p>
<p>With the death Thursday night of Tim Ryan, felled at 62 by congestive heart failure complicated by the H1N1 virus, Grant MacEwan University's influential theatre arts department is now without its leader and visionary founding father.</p>
<p>Daughter Kate Ryan said her father had a heart condition and had been ailing since spring. He entered the heart institute at the University of Alberta Hospital a week ago and was tested for the H1N1 virus, which was later confirmed.</p>
<p>The Ryans are a fabled Edmonton theatre family in the grand tradition: Both daughters, Kate and Bridget, are actors, directors and playwrights, as is his ex-wife Maralyn, and his wife Laurie Fumagalli, a pianist/musical director and lawyer.</p>
<p>They are mourning the loss of a man who combined the love of art and the love of family in a way that has resonated in theatres here and across the continent.</p>
<p>Tim--both "Professor Ryan" and indeed "Mr. Ryan" are jarringly wrong for his puckish, casual style --emigrated to Canada in 1979, a precocious young American director from Cleveland armed with a startling resume of credits in opera and theatre, to start a new program at Grant MacEwan. The way Tim has told the story, a potential musical in itself, he arrived after midnight, got put up at the Saxony, and by 9 a.m. the next day, the then-college had a theatre program that specialized in musicals, to distinguish it from the University of Alberta drama department.</p>
<p>With him on this extended, 30-year foreign excursion was his then-wife Maralyn, with whom Tim had run the prestigious Willoughby School of Fine Arts in Cleveland, modelled after Alberta's Banff Centre, for seven years. "That was a legacy, too," she says of Tim's artistic directorship there.</p>
<p>That first Canadian summer Tim put together not one, but two, big musicals: Pal Joey and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. It was a tip-off: Edmonton had acquired the services, the rarefied knowledge, and the unflagging energy and invention, of a true musical theatre expert.</p>
<p>Passion to share</p>
<p>The bonus, for 30 years of Grant Mac students, is that Tim was the rarest kind of expert, one who was "passionate to share everything he knew," as Farren Timoteo puts it. Director and lyricist of the new Teatro La Quindicina musical Everybody Goes To Mitzi's and artistic director of Alberta Opera Theatre, Timoteo says meeting Tim was "a life-changing experience," a sentiment echoed by other Grant Mac grads. "My life would not be the same if I hadn't met him," says Timoteo. "The word is 'inspiring.' He was a man of massive passion, devotion and excitement, as well as an accomplished landmark director."</p>
<p>That was his endearing charm. Not only did he know his stuff, in a way that never ceased to dazzle, he was an enthusiast, an appreciator. Talent made him hopeful, happy. Tim would call me up: "Liz, you've gotta see this kid! He's amazing! This kid cracks me up!" Musical theatre made him joyful. "There was no bigger fan," says Timoteo, one of the kids who cracked Tim up. "No show was ever just a job with him. He was in love with it, and that showed in his direction ...What I learned was that the best things would happen when you played. He'd be so full of giddy excitement."</p>
<p>The same thought occurs to Chris Wynters. The presiding muse of the folk/roots band Captain Tractor is a Grant Mac musical theatre grad who has gone on to write musicals of his own, including Red Lips with Tim, and a musical version of The Winter's Tale with Tim's daughter, Bridget. "The first thing is the energy of the man, to inspire. I'm just one of many people who feel like that," says Wynters, currently recording a CD. "Not a day goes by, in any of the things I do, that I haven't heard his voice in my head.</p>
<p>"I'm so lucky I got to work with him. Such a depth of knowledge. And so fun."</p>
<p>Juilliard tickets</p>
<p>Kate Ryan talks about the way her father "never stopped believing in us," the family actors. "If I took a role, he'd always say, 'I know you can do it!'" The gift Tim gave to many people, she says, was "never to be afraid ... When I decided in high school I wanted to go to New York, to Juilliard, he bought the ticket ... His life was the arts and he never separated that from family."</p>
<p>And as for audiences, Tim gave us musicals we'd never heard of, musicals we couldn't have hoped to see anywhere else, hip new ones, vintage ones, musicals that had flopped on Broadway because they'd been overproduced. In the summer, the academic off-season, he took his student casts to Fringe stages. In his non-existent spare time, he founded Leave It To Jane, a company that specialized in pocket, off-Broadway musicals and straight plays. He did his research where it counts, in person in the theatre. As Maralyn Ryan points out, in the year Tim spent doing an MA at the University of London-- his thesis? the application of Oriental dance and movement to theatre-- he saw 300 shows.</p>
<p>"This is a man who affected so many people," says Maralyn Ryan. "He was a storyteller, both in person and on the stage."</p>
<p>His own story, after months of declining health and six days in hospital, ended far too abruptly.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Premier asks for 'political stability'; Stelmach urges Tory 'family' to unite before leadership vote</b>
</div><div>Jason Fekete   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>799 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>A n embattled Premier Ed Stelmach appealed for political stability and Tory party unity Friday on the eve of his leadership review, calling on his "family" to band together to fend off challenges from opponents and lead Alberta out of the economic downturn.</p>
<p>In a speech to more than 1,000 Progressive Conservative faithful in Red Deer for the Tory convention--and to decide Stelmach's fate--the premier pledged more fiscal restraint in his government and evoked the successes of party leaders before him.</p>
<p>He noted his government won an overwhelming mandate from Albertans 20 months ago, but now needs the support of his party.</p>
<p>"We need the political stability to build on that massive vote of confidence," Stelmach told delegates, amid hearty cheers and pounding of thundersticks. "It's going to take the confidence and solidarity of this party, supporting your government in delivering on the commitments we made to Albertans."</p>
<p>Stelmach is facing arguably the greatest adversity of his premiership, with his party's popular support sitting at a 16-year low and public discontent growing over issues such as the H1N1 flu vaccinations, politicians'pay and the impact of the new resource royalty framework.</p>
<p>To sell his message of unity, the premier conjured memories of Tory premiers before him who also governed through challenging times --but survived and became the foundation of the party's 38-year reign over Alberta.</p>
<p>"As a family, I learned that you can always accomplish more together than as individuals," Stelmach said. "We've always demonstrated that as a party. Just as premiers Lougheed, Getty and Klein went through some difficult times, and you know, Conservatives battle through adversity together."</p>
<p>Facing mounting criticism from within his party for poor financial management, Stelmach pledged to rein in government spending.</p>
<p>He promised to limit future provincial expenditure to population growth plus inflation--a guideline that's been called for by spending watchdogs for years. He also committed to "holding the line" on spending and to "live within our means."</p>
<p>Only when he wrapped up his speech and question-and-answer session, did Stelmach ask delegates for their support in the review.</p>
<p>Calgary Ald. Diane Colley-Urquhart, a failed PC candidate in the recent Calgary-Glenmore byelection, said Stelmach delivered one of the best speeches she's heard, but isn't certain he'll survive the leadership review. If he does, he must overcome the "disconnect" with the public.</p>
<p>"If he gets by the vote(today), he'll have to work harder at making that connection with ordinary Albertans," Colley-Urquhart said. "You never know until the vote is in."</p>
<p>Others, however, predicted the premier will handily survive the leadership review.</p>
<p>"He's more than safe," said CalgaryToryMLAMoeAmery, believing Stelmach will snare more than 80 per cent.</p>
<p>Following his speech, Stelmach told reporters "we'll see what happens" with the review, but said he's "not stopping to worry" about whether he's won over detractors.</p>
<p>The expectation going into today's leadership review is that Stelmach will get by with the support he needs, argued David Taras, political analyst at the University of Calgary.</p>
<p>"Defeating him would be very difficult," Taras said.</p>
<p>Approximately 1,500 eligible PC voting delegates began rolling into Red Deer on Friday as they prepare to determine the fate of the party, premier and provincial government. A largely pro-Stelmach crowd, many wearing "I support Ed" stickers and pins with the premier's face, packed into the Capri Hotel for the start of the two-day affair.</p>
<p>But the convention opened with a bit of a political row, as some delegates sounded alarm bells about the leadership review ballots being numbered. Delegates are concerned the numbered ballot can be traced.</p>
<p>Progressive Conservative party executive director Jim Campbell said the ballots are only numbered so they can track how many are handed out, adding delegates can rip the number off the ballot.</p>
<p>Tom Olsen, the premier's press secretary, said the concern over numbered ballots is an attempt to stir up trouble.</p>
<p>"It's about mischief. We've seen stuff like this for the last two or three weeks," Olsen said. "It's something that is to be expected."</p>
<p>Beyond internal squabbling, the premier and PC party are also fighting a surging Wildrose Alliance and its new leader, Danielle Smith.</p>
<p>An Environics poll released this week revealed the Wildrose Alliance is biting at the heels of the ruling Conservatives as the favoured party among decided Alberta voters, and has vaulted past the Tories in Calgary.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Russians are out of Forsberg stakes, Canucks still bidding</b>
</div><div>Iain MacIntyre   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>526 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final C</div><div>H2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The Peter Forsberg sweepstakes -- assuming the contest isn't a hoax -- got a little smaller Friday with news that Russian champions <span class="companylink">Ak Bars</span> Kazan has no interest in the Swedish free agent.</p>
<p>The Kontinental Hockey League team was reported this week to be close to signing Forsberg. But not only has it no deal in place, it isn't interested in the 36-year-old former Hart Trophy winner who is attempting a comeback this weekend at an international tournament in Finland.</p>
<p>"We have conducted no negotiations," <span class="companylink">Ak Bars</span> Kazan vice-president Ravil Shavaleev claimed to Sovietsky Sport. "And I can tell you more: We haven't even thought of inviting him."</p>
<p>If Forsberg's chronic foot problems do not recur at the four-nations Karjala Cup, the centre is expected to sign soon with a professional club team so he can play for Sweden at the Vancouver Olympics in February.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Canucks are among a handful of National Hockey League teams interested in signing Forsberg, who briefly returned to the NHL with the Colorado Avalanche at the end of the 2007-08 season.</p>
<p>The Canucks have assigned scouts Thomas Gradin and Inge Hammarstrom and player development director Dave Gagner to assess Forsberg at the weekend tournament, which began with a 4-3 Swedish victory against the Czech Republic on Thursday.</p>
<p>"If he's healthy, he's got game left," Swedish Canuck Mikael Samuelsson said. "At the same time, it's not easy to come back. He's done it a couple of times. He's been pretty successful, even when he was [playing] hurt.</p>
<p>"He can pretty much have any role. He can do a lot of things. He's obviously a good player, but he makes other people better as well."</p>
<p>Forsberg went pointless in Sweden's tournament-opener, centring a second line that included long-time NHLer P.J. Axelsson and San Jose draft pick Patrick Zackrisson. Sweden plays Russia today, then finishes the tournament Sunday against Finland.</p>
<p>Canuck general manager Mike Gillis, who confirmed his interest in Forsberg on Thursday and told The Sun that he believed Vancouver would be on the player's short list, said he would be debriefed by his scouting staff after the tournament.</p>
<p>The Canucks began the season at the NHL salary limit of $56.8-million US and almost certainly would have to waive or trade a player to make room for Forsberg.</p>
<p>NO FLU SHOTS: Gillis has abandoned the idea of trying to get Canuck players vaccinated for H1N1 during Vancouver's U.S. road trip. "They have the same issue here they have in Canada," Gillis said, citing demand for the swine flu vaccine that far exceeds supply.</p>
<p>BERNIER IMPROVES: The condition of winger Steve Bernier, whose flu strain is not believed by Canuck medical staff to be H1N1, has improved dramatically and he could play Tuesday in St. Louis. Rather than risk a flu outbreak within the team, the Canucks bought Bernier a first-class ticket to fly commercially to Dallas from Minnesota.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'Mr. Bold' serves up a hot tip on a bad stock</b>
</div><div>David Baines   </div>

</p>
<p>It started last Saturday with a teaser. A penny stock promotion service called BoldStocks.com sent me an e-mail saying it was going to recommend a stock on Monday. The stock's identity would remain a secret until then, but "Mr. Bold" offered a hint: "It could not be more timely."</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, there was another hint: "Don't leave home without it." And in the evening, yet another: "More than 10 years in business with stable management and key researchers."</p>
<p>On Monday, the mystery company was revealed: <span class="companylink">Skinvisible Inc</span>., a Las Vegas-based company that has developed a hand sanitizer to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Boldstocks.com is one of several Internet tout services run by Pentony LLC of Frisco, Tex. The disclaimer revealed that Skinvisible had paid Pentony 500,000 restricted shares to stage this little game.</p>
<p>At the close of business on Monday, "Mr. Bold" proudly announced that Skinvisible, which trades on the OTC Bulletin Board in the United States, had closed up seven per cent on double the usual trading volume. But keep in mind, this is a penny dreadful where percentages can be very misleading. The absolute increase was one cent, to a grand total of 15 cents.</p>
<p>Skinvisible claims its "DermSafe chlorhexidine hand sanitizer has been tested against many bacteria and viruses. It has been proven to kill / inactivate a number of influenza A viruses; including a strain of H1N1, the swine flu virus."</p>
<p>But there are lots of effective hand sanitizers already on the market (including plain old soap). The difference is that Skinvisible claims it has a patented ingredient that fights germs up to four hours after washing, but this has not been proven.</p>
<p>In the United States, the product requires Federal Drug Administration approval before it can claim to combat swine flu. It has not received that approval. In Canada, the product has been approved by Health Canada for personal use only.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the company announced it has sold licensing rights to a distributor for all of Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. This might be encouraging, but for two things: Payment terms were not disclosed, and the announcement was made by Terry Howlett, the company's president and CEO.</p>
<p>Howlett is well known to me as a former Howe Street denizen who learned very early in his career that a promoter, like a virus, has to adapt quickly to its environment to survive.</p>
<p>Howlett's first Howe Street adventure, Presley Laboratories Inc., was listed on the Vancouver Stock Exchange in April 1987.</p>
<p>It began as a multi-level marketer of "Lady Love" cosmetics and hair products, but soon switched gears and announced it would acquire Modern Electronics Inc., which had developed a security system for buildings.</p>
<p>By June that year, the company was referring to Modern as its "wholly owned subsidiary" and projecting sales of $500,000 the first year and $1 million the second. But several months later, Howlett announced the "proposed" acquisition had fallen through. More premature exclamations would follow.</p>
<p>In September 1988, Howlett announced Presley would market a telephone touch-tone order entry system developed by a person named Jerry Hodge of Irving, Tex. (A dozen years later, Hodge would pop up again in Skinvisible.)</p>
<p>In February 1989, Howlett announced a letter of intent to sell 10 systems worth $665,000 to a Calgary company over the next six months. Projected sales over the next year were $3.3 million.</p>
<p>But within several months, he announced this deal had also fallen through. Instead, the company would sell marketing and software rights to the ordering system to a Vancouver company for $5.5 million. This also fell apart.</p>
<p>In January 1990, Howe Street bon vivant Harry Moll -- who was building a VSE mini-conglomerate called <span class="companylink">Pineridge Capital Group</span> -- acquired a controlling interest in Presley from Howlett.</p>
<p>Howlett -- who remained as chairman -- kept churning out good news. He said the company's Canadian dealer would buy $6 million worth of product over the next 12 months. And that was just Canada. Marketing in the U.S. would start in September 1990.</p>
<p>As always, the proof was in the financial statements. Total sales for the two years ending July 1991 -- when Howlett was promising millions of dollars in revenues -- were only $98,000, and losses were a whopping $1.3 million.</p>
<p>In 1992, Moll's mini-conglomerate collapsed in scandal. It was revealed he had sold hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of shares in Presley and several other Moll-controlled companies to the Wolverhampton municipal pension fund in England. That raised the question, what was a supposedly sober fund like this doing in flaky stocks like these?</p>
<p>The fund manager was later fired, raising suggestions that he had been taking bribes. Moll denied he had provided any special incentives: "Just lunch, and a cocktail or two," he said.</p>
<p>Then-B.C. premier Glen Clark was sufficiently alarmed by Moll's antics that he commissioned a government inquiry into regulation of the exchange. VSE officials, meanwhile, blackballed Moll from any association with its listed companies.</p>
<p>In the wake of this scandal, Moll returned control of Presley -- which by this time had been renamed Voice-It Technologies Inc. -- to Howlett.</p>
<p>Without missing a beat, Howlett announced the touch-tone ordering system would be used in a venture called Talking Flowers, which enabled people to send flowers and talking messages to their loved ones. It was also a flop.</p>
<p>Howlett made more breath-taking announcements that never amounted to anything. By June 1997, he resigned as director and president. The company limped along until March 1999, when it was suspended for failure to file financial statements, then delisted for failing to pay its listing fees.</p>
<p>In 2000, Howlett reunited with his old pal Hodge and his buddy Moll -- even though he had been thoroughly disgraced by now -- and took Skinvisible public on the bulletin board.</p>
<p>In his usual style, Howlett has been spewing a steady stream of boosterish announcements, but they haven't amounted to much. During the six months ending June 30, the company reported $146,976 US in sales while racking up another $879,621 in losses, raising its cumulative losses to $17.8 million. Total assets were only $195,938 against $746,484 in liabilities, which means the company is basically insolvent.</p>
<p>Howlett said during a brief telephone interview this week that he now lives in Las Vegas, where the company's head office is located. He said Moll and Hodge are no longer involved.</p>
<p>I asked what he thought of the BoldStocks.com hype. He said he had nothing to do with it, which is strange considering that Pentony says the company paid 500,000 shares for the service.</p>
<p>Asked what he thinks of that style of promotion, he replied, "I have no opinion on it."</p>
<p>That was an astute answer. I mean, who wants to spoil their own party?</p>

</p>
<p>Although the H1N1 flu pandemic is certainly a genuine public health concern, balance appears lacking in how the media are disseminating information about its effects and measures to prevent and treat it.</p>
<p>In the latter category, in "Should you get the H1N1 vaccine?" (Nov. 4) Drs. Lilah Rossi and Jane Hailey stated that "Tamiflu is an antiviral that is safe for everyone, including pregnant women."</p>
<p>While Tamiflu is an effective antiviral medication, not all affected patients should be taking it. Guidelines are in place. The drug's makers state unequivocally that it is "normally not recommended for use during pregnancy or nursing, as the effects on the unborn child or nursing infant are unknown." See Tamiflu.com/sideeffects.aspx.)</p>
<p>Before taking Tamiflu, pregnant patients need to talk to their doctors. The same goes for patients with kidney or liver diseases. Also, Tamiflu is not indicated for children younger than one year.</p>

<p>I thought Dr. Catherine D'Amico did a good job of explaining the sterilized H1N1 virus in the vaccine versus a live virus taxing the immune system ("Warning: Vaccine misinformation is contagious," Oct. 27). What she neglected to mention is what happens to the immune system when a person is infected with the live virus and then gets the vaccine on top of that.</p>
<p>It has long been my understanding that once a person is bitten by a bat, he/she doesn't seek rabies vaccine and that when you have chicken pox, you don't seek a vaccine. Therefore, isn't it too late to start vaccinating against H1N1, since the pandemic is already upon us?</p>
<p>When this flu started circulating in Mexico, Mexican governments shut down schools and universities and cancelled large public gatherings to stem the spread. It worked.</p>
<p>Why, then, are we allowing -- and, indeed, encouraging -- people to line up thousands deep in enclosed spaces to await their already-too-late vaccine? Large numbers of these people must be carrying the virus and infecting others in the lineups.</p>
<p>Just a thought from a mom whose two teenagers recently got and beat this flu.</p>

<p>Dr. Richard Schabas is used to swimming against the tide. He resigned as Ontario's chief medical officer of health in 1997 after becoming frustrated that his advice was being ignored by the provincial government.</p>
<p>After seven people died and more than 2,000 fell ill from contaminated water in Walkerton, Ont., he testified at a judicial inquiry that then-premier Mike Harris refused to listen when he tried to warn that funding cuts he was making would lead to exactly that kind of disaster.</p>
<p>In 2003 he harshly criticized Ontario's response to the SARS outbreak, arguing that it depended on needless press conferences that pointlessly frightened people based on shaky science while failing to exercise the kind of rigorous surveillance that should have been in place.</p>
<p>Now he's at it again with H1N1. In August, he publicly challenged health officials to show their rationale for a universal vaccination program.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview Friday, he said that case still hasn't been made, and in his current role as the medical health officer for two counties in southeastern Ontario, he is not recommending that otherwise healthy people get vaccinated when their turn comes.</p>
<p>"I stand to be corrected on this but I've never seen a well-written, reasoned explanation as to what the business case is and the health case is for immunizing 25 million low-risk Canadians against this virus."</p>
<p>He argues that the pandemic plan was developed before much was known about the H1N1 virus, and once the evidence was in from the flu season in the southern hemisphere, it was never reconsidered.</p>
<p>In his criticism of the H1N1 advice from the federal and provincial governments, Schabas doesn't have much in common with the league of vaccine-doubters on the Internet.</p>
<p>He says the H1N1 vaccine is safe and effective and that it is important for vulnerable people to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>He also supports the universal immunization program Ontario has been running for several years for seasonal flu.</p>
<p>But he argues that the seasonal flu program differs from H1N1 in a couple of important ways.</p>
<p>First, seasonal flu is worse than H1N1 from a public health point of view.</p>
<p>"We think that 4,000 people a year die from seasonal flu, and these are primarily older people who cannot mount immunity as effectively using the vaccine, so the logic for universal immunization is to protect them by preventing younger people from getting the disease," he said.</p>
<p>"In this so-called wave of H1N1, we probably won't see more than 200 deaths and 300 total for the first two waves for all of Canada, not remotely comparable to what we'd see from seasonal flu."</p>
<p>The other problem is that by the time otherwise healthy people are to get the vaccine, it will be too late to do much good.</p>
<p>"Local outbreaks are going to last six-eight weeks. Provincial outbreaks, maybe eight-10 weeks, but no matter how you cut it, B.C. must be pretty much at its peak, unless there's something extraordinary. I don't know, maybe it's the water or something."</p>
<p>B.C. provincial health officer, Dr. Perry Kendall, is still urging British Columbians to get the vaccine when it becomes available.</p>
<p>So with conflicting advice from the people we count on as health authorities, who should ordinary folk believe, I asked.</p>
<p>Right now, Schabas says, it doesn't matter, because the vaccine isn't available yet. After that, people will have a choice to make.</p>
<p>"I suspect that at least in Southern Ontario and British Columbia, 10 days from now it will be obvious to everyone that these outbreaks are on the wane if not almost over.</p>
<p>"And if people still want to go out and get vaccinated against a disease that's come and gone, that's their privilege."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Managing the crisis is his business; Dr. Perry Kendall cut short a Mexican vacation after hearing about a highly pathogenic virus. He's been busy ever since</b>
</div><div>Randy Shore   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>1003 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall was enjoying a holiday in Mexico last spring when he heard about a new virus ripping through parts of Mexico and it looked like a killer.</p>
<p>B.C.'s medical health officer hopped a plane home a week early, leaving his family to finish their vacation.</p>
<p>"I came back and everybody was on an emergency public health footing," he said. "The critical thing was that we had to determine the nature of the virus because the initial reports out of Mexico were that it was a highly pathogenic virus with lots more morbidity than what it proved out to be."</p>
<p>Kendall immediately took on the role of co-chair of the federal-provincial public health advisory committee and dialled into daily conference calls with his counterparts across Canada.</p>
<p>Before the end of April, 20 people had died in Mexico and World Health Organization director general Margaret Chan declared the H1N1 pandemic "a public health emergency of international concern."</p>
<p>"We were tracking it across Canada and around the world and watching the numbers go up quite markedly," Kendall said. B.C. began to roll out anti-viral drugs to people most at risk of serious complications or death as a first line of defence in the absence of a vaccine. Anti-viral drugs can be used by those who catch the virus to reduce the severity of symptoms and shorten the course of the illness.</p>
<p>A June outbreak of the virus on Manitoba first nations reserves that saw dozens of people breathing on ventilators "set alarm bells ringing," Kendall said.</p>
<p>"We started developing our first real outreach plan for rural and aboriginal communities, knowing that they would likely be the most at risk," Kendall said. Those populations remain a priority and were among the first groups to get the vaccine when B.C.'s vaccination program finally got going two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Although public panic is not a desirable reaction to a flu virus, Kendall maintains that the word "pandemic" is generating unreasonable fear. In daily press conferences this past week, he has carefully pointed out each and every day that the H1N1 influenza -- also known as swine flu -- is a mild to moderate flu with a much lower risk of death than the seasonal flu we battle year in and year out.</p>
<p>"We saw the numbers go up and up and up and we had a few school closures that June because we didn't know if the virus was bad or not," he recalled. "Then we had what was effectively a mass school closure across Canada," he said, referring to summer holidays.</p>
<p>Kendall fanned a faint ember of hope that when schools let out for the summer vacation, the virus might peter out and disappear.</p>
<p>Normally, as the weather improves and schools let out, flu activity slows, and H1N1 was no exception.</p>
<p>"What we didn't know was whether it would come back and how it would come back," he said.</p>
<p>For instruction, they looked to the winter flu season in Australia and New Zealand, which coincides with our summer. Demographically similar to Canada -- complete with an indigenous population -- those southern hemisphere nations provide a glimpse of one possible future and a chance to judge the success of their efforts to manage the outbreak.</p>
<p>"We could then guess what the impact might be on Canada in the fall and draft guidelines for treatment and figure how to manage a mass community outbreak to a new form of the swine flu," Kendall said. "We had people working across the country on clinical guidelines, looking at evidence that would support school closures and questions like should we close churches."</p>
<p>Had B.C. not reopened the schools in September, the current outbreak of H1N1 might have been delayed for weeks or months, which might have given authorities enough time to roll out vaccinations before it struck, he said, dismissing the idea as impractical. "We want to deal with it as best we can without paralysing society."</p>
<p>Early in the summer, the WHO began releasing seed strain samples of swine flu so countries could begin vaccine production.</p>
<p>"But our producer [<span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>] in Canada was full steam ahead on producing the seasonal influenza vaccine," Kendall said. The consensus among the country's health officers was to allow that production to continue before starting on the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>"We decided to have the company fulfil its contract for seasonal vaccine," he said. Had Canada asked GSK to stop production and switch to H1N1 vaccine production, "we might have gained a week or two, which would have been useful."</p>
<p>Hindsight is always 20/20, but indications through the early summer were that the second wave peaking now in B.C. would not be too severe.</p>
<p>"We knew H1N1 would come back, but we are seeing more infections than they did in New Zealand and Australia," he explained.</p>
<p>As a public health officer, crisis is Kendall's business, but that doesn't make an outbreak a particularly fun time. Not when your work day starts before 6 a.m. with four hours of e-mail, three conference calls and one media briefing to follow.</p>
<p>"When the SARS outbreak came along in 2003 I thought, 'This is what I've been training for as a public health physician in many respects,'" he said. "Then I hoped it wouldn't come back in my working lifetime, but it has."</p>
<p>When the pandemic wanes, Kendall hopes to pick up where he left off seven months ago. "I'm planning a week at Christmas to go back to Mexico," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>My feverish daughter opened the door to fear</b>
</div><div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>766 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>J1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>It was a scene that has surely played out in hundreds of homes across</p>
<p>Ottawa, thousands across the province, tens of thousands in the country.</p>
<p>My husband and I looked helplessly at our feverish tween-aged daughter -- in bed, shaking with chills, her fever not responding to Tylenol -- and tried hard not to fear the worst. But, of course, we did.</p>
<p>We listened for "shortened breath." (How short is shortened breath?) We tried hard not to think about the deaths of Vanetia Warner and Evan Frustaglio, so close in age to our child. And we tried hard to keep parental anxiety from escalating into full-blown fear.</p>
<p>Fear is usually portrayed as bad, something that leads otherwise rational people to act rashly and the public to demand that the authorities do something, anything, no matter how impractical that something may be.</p>
<p>But can't fear also be good, something to spur the passive to action?</p>
<p>In our case, that most fearful moment in the middle of the night led us on a search for information. As a reporter, I fancy myself up to speed on the major topics of the day. But it's amazing how a shaking child left me unsure of my grasp of facts.</p>
<p>Along with my husband, I turned to the Internet for information on when to take her to the hospital: a few days of fever (uh-oh) and shortness of breath (definition, please).</p>
<p>Following a few productive <span class="companylink">Google</span> searches, our next stop: Ontario's toll-free Tele-Health line. After a 40-minute wait we were told that a nurse would call us back -- in five hours. Instead, in semi-consciousness we alternated shifts, listening all night for what might be considered shortness of breath.</p>
<p>In the morning, we called our doctor's office only to be told she was not in that day. Although our family doc is part of a practice that offers walk-ins for patients only, the lineups for that service were, the voice on the line warned, monstrous.</p>
<p>Of course, our daughter came through it fine, as will the vast majority of flu sufferers. But the experience left me wondering where fear fits in the pandemic response puzzle. In our case, it prompted us to find online advice. For others, that wouldn't have been enough.</p>
<p>It was fear that led a wide swath of the population to change their minds about getting vaccinated. From a public health perspective, this should have been good news. After all, officials had been urging everyone to get the shot. But when demand surged, the system wasn't prepared to handle it.</p>
<p>The problem with fear, though, is that it threatens to metastasize into panic when the systems in place are inadequate. Generalities never put anyone's mind at ease. Mixed messages are worse.</p>
<p>For instance, the official position that only individuals in designated high-risk groups should come to early vaccination clinics was undermined by the fact that others who showed up -- not-at-risk parents of toddlers, spouses of those with underlying conditions -- were routinely given, even offered, their shots too.</p>
<p>As well, health-care workers brought along many</p>
<p>family and friends to their vaccination sites for unauthorized shots. What's the signal there? Same with the late moves to add school-age</p>
<p>children to the approved list at some public clinics. Why, in light of the vaccine shortage?</p>
<p>These inconsistencies and lapses are perfectly understandable. It's a challenging, changing situation. But the point of pandemic planning is for those in charge to know in advance how they'll respond when fear goes viral.</p>
<p>It might turn out to be just as important to know how to respond when fear subsides. Because perhaps the most amazing thing about fear is how rapidly it gives way to apathy.</p>
<p>Once you've had the flu or received the shot, it's easy to feel invincible -- I've been using handrails with abandon for a week now! -- or at least detached. Your kid sleeps soundly and so do you. As the H1N1 story unfolds, look for the theme of the first weeks -- mass fear -- to give way, probably too early, to indifference.</p>
<p>It's only natural. But like so many issues, short-term and chronic, personal and public, we'd do well to try to keep a bit of that sense of urgency alive after the crisis has passed. Think of it as remembering the fear of the night in the welcome light of day.</p>

</p>
<p>Why is the government creating such confusion over the H1N1 vaccination? To make people, sick or healthy, stand in long lines not knowing if or when they're to receive the vaccine is ridiculous.</p>
<p>There should be strict guidelines that should be followed. People should have to present proper identification and proof with their medicare cards.</p>
<p>The chaos could be alleviated if the government would agree to vaccinate children in their schools as they do with so many other vaccines. The parents of these children could be vaccinated at the same time.</p>
<p>Churches and synagogues could step up to the plate. too. They could do vaccinations too. What about our own doctors? It is absurd that they are not given these vaccines to administer to their patients.</p>
<p>There has to be a much better, and more organized system than what is in place now. Too many people are receiving vaccinations who are not on the priority list. By the time Dec. 7 rolls around, will there be vaccine left to inoculate my family?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mexico from A to Z; Mexico has been hit hard by the recession, the flu and weather. Which is why it's a great time to go</b>
</div><div>Andrew McCredie   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>1637 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>G1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Can there be any group that has suffered the slings and arrows of misfortune more in the past year than Mexico's tourism industry?</p>
<p>First, a worldwide economic downturn of unprecedented scope decimated the number of international travellers visiting the country; next a tiny Mexican village became ground zero for a swine flu pandemic; then hurricanes and all-around nasty weather battered its Pacific coastline.</p>
<p>Now the skies have cleared and, just as they have for centuries, the Mexican people will rebuild and come back better and stronger.</p>
<p>As the tourism industry heads into an all-important winter season, an improving global economic outlook should help their effort, as should airfare and accommodation deals too good for Canadian travellers to pass up.</p>
<p>If that's not enough, here's a list from A to Z of what the country has to offer.</p>
<p>A - Archeology</p>
<p>Get in touch with your inner Indiana Jones at any number of archeological sites, featuring pyramids, caves, lost cities and sacred sacrificial bogs. Catch one of the ancient wonders of the New World at Chichen Itza, especially during the spring or fall equinoxes when the sun's light creates a slithering serpent descending the Temple of Kukulkan. Simply otherworldly.</p>
<p>B - Beaches</p>
<p>Of course, reading about ancient civilizations is almost as good as being there, and there's no better place to soak up some scholarship and the sun than a Mexican beach. My personal favourites run along the Pacific Ocean, as surf big and small is never far away, and there's nothing like falling asleep to the sound of rolling waves.</p>
<p>C - Cancun/Cabo</p>
<p>The bona fide Spring Break capitals of Mexico -- if not the world -- the double shot of Cancun and Cabo San Lucas is party central from January through May. Tens of thousands of college students descend on the beaches and bars of these built-to-party resorts to blow off semester stresses. Be afraid. Be very afraid.</p>
<p>D - Diego Rivera</p>
<p>Just as the Group of Seven's stark, desolate style defines the Canadian experience, Diego Rivera's paintings define Mexico's. Many of his great works are found throughout the world's top museums and galleries, however, Mexico City's Museo Dolores Olmedo is home to a treasured Rivera collection and one well worth a visit.</p>
<p>E - Ecotourism</p>
<p>Sure it's a rather contrived buzzword, but ecotourism is a vibrant part of Mexico's tourism business, and judging from the ever-increasing number of operators going green, it isn't going away any time soon. One of the best tours is the Sian Ka'an Biosphere, located on the Mayan Riviera in the largest protected area in the Mexican Caribbean.</p>
<p>F - Festivals/Fiestas</p>
<p>If there's one thing Mexicans love to do, it is party, and the nation's calendar is littered with fiestas. Festivals large and small take place throughout the year and throughout the country. Next year, consider booking a flight to Mexico City to catch El Día de los Muertos, the spooky Day of the Dead festival, on Nov. 2 in the city's Mixquic suburb. Once a village in its own right, it retains its rural roots and its Day of the Dead celebration is said to be one of the most colourful.</p>
<p>G - Golf</p>
<p>The game's global explosion the past two decades has left an indelible imprint on Mexico, with some 150 courses scattered throughout the country. For a memorable golf holiday, check out El Tamarindo Beach & Golf Resort, located between Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta in a 2,040-acre nature preserve. The thing about this luxury resort is even if you don't golf, you'll be blown away by the lush and undeveloped setting.</p>
<p>H - H1N1</p>
<p>Taking a page or two from Tourism Canada's playbook following the SARS outbreak of 2003, Mexico has been on full damage control since spring, when the so-called swine flu devastated the all-important tourism business. The upshot? Great deals for Canadian travellers. And wash your hands.</p>
<p>I - Isla Mujeres</p>
<p>Located a dozen kilometres from the party capital of Mexico, this tranquil island couldn't be more different from the nearby Spring Break mecca of Cancun. Just seven kilometres long and 650 metres wide, Isla Mujeres is a great place to chill out for a day or totally unwind for a week.</p>
<p>J - Jalapeno</p>
<p>The little chili that launched a million heartburns is cultivated in a number of places in Mexico, but the Papaloapan River basin is where it was traditionally produced by the townspeople of Xalapa.</p>
<p>K - Kissing</p>
<p>Latin American countries are renowned for their homegrown lovers, but it's not difficult for visitors to Mexico to find a little love in the air too. Long a honeymoon destination, the country is ripe for romance.</p>
<p>L - Lime</p>
<p>What is it about putting a lime in a pint that makes even a rainy night in an Ottawa lounge seem a little bit of Mexico? Nearly 15 per cent of the world's limes come from Mexico, and with the fruit growing virtually everywhere in the country.</p>
<p>M - Mayan Riviera</p>
<p>Few stretches of waterfront anywhere in the world offer the diverse range of experiences that this 132-kilometre tourist corridor does. There are Mayan ruins in Tulum at one end, at the other a Hooters restaurant in Cancun; there are all-inclusive luxury resorts just minutes from the quaint seaside town of Playa del Carmen; and there are five-star restaurants where a dinner jacket is required and beachside stands that serve you barefoot.</p>
<p>N - National Palace</p>
<p>Built more than a century before the Palace of Versailles, the National Palace in Mexico City sits on a site that has served as the seat of power since the Aztec Empire. Fittingly, the main stairwell mural painted by Diego Rivera is titled The Epic of the Mexican People.</p>
<p>O - Oaxaca</p>
<p>The Free and Sovereign State of Oaxaca has more than 250 kilometres of accessible beaches, but it's the colonial architecture in the capital city of Oaxaca that brings camera-toting tourists to this Pacific Coast state by the planeload.</p>
<p>P - Pesos</p>
<p>With the loonie translating to roughly 12 pesos, coupled with the fact the country's reeling tourist industry has slashed prices across the board, there's plenty of value for the Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>Q - Quesadillas</p>
<p>Ottawa's Mexicali Rosa's serves up tasty quesadillas, but as the old saying goes, "Ain't nothing like the real thing, amigo." Best one I ever had was at an outdoor restaurant in the busy town centre of Manzanillo.</p>
<p>R - Riviera Nayarit</p>
<p>Located just north of Puerto Vallarta on the Pacific Coast, this new luxury resort community has quickly, and somewhat quietly, become the place to play golf in Mexico. No fewer than six championship courses are within an hour's drive of one another, and later this month the Jack Nicklaus-designed Punta Mita Pacifico course hosts a Canadian Professional Golf Tour event, the Riviera Nayarit Classic.</p>
<p>S - Scuba/Surfing</p>
<p>From the world-class diving sites off Cozumel to the Pacific Ocean swells off Puerto Escondido, Mexico is heaven for those who like to dive below the waves and those who like to ride them. Most resorts offer scuba certification courses for beginners, while surf schools can be found up and down the Pacific coastline.</p>
<p>T - Tourism</p>
<p>As integral to Mexico's economy as natural resources are to Canada's, international tourism to the country has taken a battering the past year for reasons it can't control. But with more than one out of every 10 Mexicans employed directly in the industry, the country is pouring resources into promoting itself around the world.</p>
<p>U - UNESCO</p>
<p>Mexico ranks first in the Americas and eighth in the world for the number of sites recognized in recent years by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. No fewer than 26 sites have UNESCO endorsement for their historical, cultural and natural significance.</p>
<p>V - Veracruz</p>
<p>Home to the highest point in Mexico -- the 5,363-metre volcano Citaltépetl -- the State of Veracruz is also home to the oldest still-standing Catholic chapel built in the Americas (in the village of La Antigua). Papantla, in the state of Veracruz, is home to the ritual dance of Los Voladores (The Flyers), shown above.</p>
<p>W - Whale watching</p>
<p>The Pacific Ocean off Mexico is a major whale highway, and an increasing number of tour operators will help you get close to these creatures. Mid-December to March is prime whale-watching season, and with some tour operators using spotter planes to locate the massive marine mammals, your chances are good.</p>
<p>X - Xcaret Eco Park</p>
<p>Imagine if <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> built a Mayan ecological theme park and you'll have some idea what this place is all about. Featuring the flora and fauna of the Mexican southeast, including sea turtles, manatees and spider monkeys, the main attraction is a massive water park that lets you swim with dolphins and other marine life. Great for families.</p>
<p>Y - Yucatan Peninsula</p>
<p>Rich in history and culture, the Yucatan peninsula was home to the ancient Maya and boasts two of the greatest archeological sites in all of Mexico -- Chichen Itza and Tulum, shown above.</p>
<p>Z - Zihuatanejo</p>
<p>This laid-back Pacific Coast community is part fishing village, part beach resort and is the ideal place to recharge for a week or so. For a great dining experience, check out Coconuts. And if the urge strikes for some Jell-O shooters and techno, the bright lights of Ixtapa are just a cab ride away.</p>

<p>Re: "Getting the runaround" (Gazette, Nov. 5).</p>
<p>I read Michelle Goodman's saga trying to get her daughter Hannah vaccinated. We have finally entered the Twilight Zone, when an immuno-suppressed girl whose father is home with H1N1 cannot get vaccinated, but the Calgary Flames and their families can.</p>
<p>The person who arranged the Flames' shots has been fired, and so should all the "health-care providers" who turned Hannah away.</p>

<div>923 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>D1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>One of my favourite newspaper headlines about the H1N1 crisis read, "Now is not the time to panic."</p>
<p>Presumably, public health officials will let us know when it's the right time to become hysterical.</p>
<p>Some people, however, haven't waited to panic. Medical experts have been clear about the risks of contracting H1N1 and they describe the virus as milder than the seasonal flu. Nevertheless, there are those, including a few of our political leaders, who are reacting as though tens of thousands of lives are at risk.</p>
<p>The result is that even if H1N1 isn't as serious as some fearmongers would have you believe, it could still be very costly for business.</p>
<p>Across the country, almost every available public health resource has been turned over to a mass vaccination program. Nevertheless, opposition parties are raging about supposed missteps in getting the antidote to the public. Professional hockey teams have attracted fury for getting their players inoculated ahead of the public.</p>
<p>(You can forgive the Toronto Maple Leafs for jumping the queue. They just wanted to know what it felt like to be first at something.)</p>
<p>Public health officials are in a difficult position. Their objective is to react proportionately to the virus but they can't appear to take a threat too lightly. What if H1N1 turned out to be worse than expected and they had chosen not to produce a vaccine? So, they err on the side of extreme caution.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with being better safe than sorry, right? Unfortunately, there is a cost to overreacting. The <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> predicts that a mild pandemic would cut Canada's economic growth by two per cent. But just the threat of H1N1 is already causing a change in consumer behaviour and employee productivity. Workers are distracted. They're more likely to stay home if either they or their kids have the sniffles. Consumers are said to be going out less often. It's like round two of the bus strike.</p>
<p>Some stories have suggested that businesses are underprepared. An Ontario Chamber of Commerce survey found that only 22 per cent of companies have an emergency preparedness plan.</p>
<p>Another study by the <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> showed that 82 per cent of small businesses don't have a health-related continuity plan. And an <span class="companylink">American Express</span> survey showed that 80 per cent of small-business owners put preparing for disruption low on their priority lists.</p>
<p>But none of that proves that businesses are avoiding or refusing to prepare for H1N1. It just shows that in many cases they can't.</p>
<p>If you have a retail operation with three employees and two of them are sick, no amount of planning will prepare you for that. Instead, you do what small businesses do: Hope for the best and adapt when necessary.</p>
<p>Even in a larger company, which might have the resources to prepare exhaustive plans, there's little you can do to change public reaction and the potential impact on your business. Your only choice is whether to ride it out or look for opportunities arising from the crisis.</p>
<p>If there is a silver lining, it's that you don't have to be a manufacturer of hand sanitizer to be opportunistic.</p>
<p>A change in consumer behaviour is often an opportunity to improve market share.</p>
<p>If you can differentiate yourself from your competitors based on a new priority for your customers, you can profit.</p>
<p>The H1N1 situation is a chance to show your customers that you are serious about health and cleanliness.</p>
<p>A grocery store, for example, could introduce new protocols for handling produce that would separate it from its rivals.</p>
<p>More importantly, it's a chance to partner with employees on a healthier work environment.</p>
<p>Putting bottles of hand sanitizer around the office might once have been a wasted effort.</p>
<p>Maybe now, more employees will take advantage of them regularly and you'll see fewer sick days from the seasonal flu next year.</p>
<p>Until recently, you were a hero if you showed up for work even if you were suffering from flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Now, you might be considered a jerk for bringing your germs to the office.</p>
<p>Some employees, especially hourly workers, may come in anyway because they can't afford to miss a day's pay. And others may still feel guilty about burdening their co-workers with the extra load.</p>
<p>But there is a new consciousness about protecting the work environment that didn't exist before.</p>
<p>With the right input from management, that could be a good thing for a business long after H1N1 is old news.</p>
<p>A crisis is often the only time that significant change in behaviour occurs.</p>
<p>Some medical experts have argued for years we should do away with the handshake, but it's hard to change a custom without a huge incentive.</p>
<p>And while getting people to regularly bow or tap elbows may still seem highly unlikely, it wasn't that long ago that people were coughing and sneezing into their hands and not their elbows.</p>
<p>Change is possible when fear is a motivator.</p>
<p>To a level-headed business person who is used to measuring risk, the response to H1N1 may be an overreaction that is frustrating and damaging.</p>
<p>But you can't control the hysteria.</p>
<p>Instead, treat it like any other crisis: Be glad it's not bigger and try to profit from it as best you can.</p>

<p>Helping those in need is the foremost function of all persons at whatever level or position they may be. Religious leaders can help individually as well as collectively through their congregations by asking their volunteers to help people in need of transport to medical facilities, offering church halls and facilities for organizing inoculation camps, assuring the safe handling of food and other items in places of worship.</p>
<p>They can also help inform their congregation about the advice from medical experts and government programs, specially for people who do not have good knowledge of official languages.</p>
<p>Collection of donations for places of natural disasters has been a part of Sikh Gurdwara Societies all over the world.</p>
<p>If the pandemic situation becomes serious, religious leaders should keep themselves informed and try to help in the best possible manner.</p>
<p>Finally, religious leaders can furnish spiritual advice to congregants in times of extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>Getting through this flu season will take a community effort. As part of the larger community, religious leaders have a part to play.</p>
<p>The pastors at our church are seeking to make a contribution in three practical ways.</p>
<p>First, we are encouraging our congregation to help reduce the spread of the flu. We ask folks to make use of the hand-sanitizer dispensers that we've added to our church lobby. We're also encouraging folks who are ill to stay home and listen to the service online at our church's website.</p>
<p>Second, we will encourage our congregation to help relieve the suffering caused by the flu. Many people at the Met are part of a smaller group that meets during the week.</p>
<p>We've found these small groups become like extended families, caring for one another as needs arise. Group members can bring meals or run errands for those who are ill.</p>
<p>They can also look beyond our congregation and help meet needs of those in the wider community. Galatians 6:10 instructs us: "Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers."</p>
<p>Third, we will encourage our congregation to reorient their perspective about the flu. Many people are anxious and afraid about the dangers posed by the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>As pastors, we can invite them to cast their anxieties on God in prayer (Philippians 4:6). We can encourage them to trust God's protecting power and sustaining grace (2 Corinthians 12:9-10).</p>
<p>We can remind them that life on earth is fragile and fleeting. We all need to be ready to face eternity.</p>
<p>That means having a personal, life-changing relationship with God through faith in His Son Jesus.</p>
<p>Faith in Christ gives security the swine flu can't touch.</p>

<p>Religious leaders must encourage those entrusted to their care to consider recommendations of the authorities so as to avoid sickness and remain calm. With the advice of our physicians, each of us must do what is best to remain healthy.</p>
<p>Our leaders can do much to help each of us to do this with serenity and certainty. It is important to review our practices at home, at work or school and during our leisure time as well.</p>
<p>In our archdiocese, Archbishop Prendergast issued a thorough set of guidelines to be put into effect in each parish, according to their specific needs. He left it up to each pastor to work with his congregation to set a policy that meets their needs, often different from one parish to another.</p>
<p>At the Cathedral Basilica, we had already begun to modify certain practices when the guidelines were issued.</p>
<p>Once we received them, we studied them and developed a practice that suited our own situation.</p>
<p>We have eliminated shaking hands at the exchange of peace: We show reverence for our neighbours by bowing to them or finding some other appropriate gesture. We have limited the sharing of the cup of precious blood to the priests. We have reminded everyone that they are excused from the Sunday obligation if they are ill. We have asked anyone who feels the least bit ill to stay home so as not to pass on any virus.</p>
<p>Finally (I find this the most difficult), when priests greet all the members of the congregation at the door before and after Mass, they no longer shake hands with them.</p>
<p>All of this will remain in effect until the threat of this flu has passed. Should things become more severe, we may put other suggestions that the archbishop has made into effect.</p>

<p>They can contribute what they always do: a broader spiritual perspective. Of course, they will also take the normal precautions expected of those responsible for gatherings in public places.</p>
<p>This is especially needed in tactile congregations that normally put a lot of emphasis on physical contact, as Orthodox Christians do: the kiss of peace, receiving communion on a spoon from a common cup, kissing icons, the cross and the priest's hand for a blessing. The sacraments are "for the healing of soul and body," but we don't want to be foolish and dare God to protect us.</p>
<p>Although it is not as virulent as first expected, the virus is another piece of evidence of a natural world gone wrong.</p>
<p>As St. Paul wrote, "We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labour pains until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies" (Romans 8:22-23).</p>
<p>Jesus healed sicknesses as a sign that there is no room for illness in a future spiritual kingdom of eternal life, "where there is no sickness, nor sorrow, nor sighing." But it's not here yet and we still wait in hope.</p>
<p>Finally, a pandemic also reminds us that "the natural environment unites us in ways that transcend doctrinal differences," as Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople said recently (he is the spiritual head of the Eastern Orthodox Church and is known as "the Green Patriarch" for his attention to ecology).</p>
<p>The fact that I can catch H1N1 from a total stranger who pressed the buttons on a vending machine before I did is just a tiny example of this invisible intertwining of human lives. Whatever our other sources of identity -- religious, civic, ethnic, socio-economic -- we are first of all human beings linked in innumerable ways.</p>

</p>
<p>Leadership, plain and simple.</p>
<p>Leadership in this has many applications. Mainly, though, it is leadership by example. Leadership involves making sure there is no panic, but also no laxity.</p>
<p>Leadership includes assuring that the liquid hand cleanser is readily available for the congregation attending services or other events, and that it is used properly, not in a token way.</p>
<p>The proper way takes about 20 seconds, with the gel reaching all areas, including between the fingers, and rubbed in well.</p>
<p>Leadership means urging congregants to stay home if they are not feeling well, much as you would want them to attend services.</p>
<p>Leadership means inspiring them to think about the welfare of others as we wrestle through this health challenge. So, staying home from work or school instead of being heroic is a message the congregations need to hear from their leaders.</p>
<p>And other means of personal acknowledgement than the simple handshake, which is a potent germ transmitter, need to be implemented. At our congregation, we are starting to use the "elbow touch."</p>
<p>Then there is the matter of the vaccine itself. There are probably individuals who should not take the vaccine.</p>
<p>Aside from those, taking the vaccine again falls into the category of leadership, by example and by message.</p>
<p>Religious leaders should take the vaccine, they should state in public that they are so doing, and they should push their congregants to do the same.</p>
<p>There is a moral issue here, namely the responsibility we all have for the welfare of society. Each of us has the sacred duty to take the appropriate actions that will be in society's best interests. Failure to take the vaccine obviously increases the chances of contracting the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>This in turn increases the chances of transmitting the flu to others, with consequences that are not in our control, but are surely our responsibility.</p>
<p>It is therefore a religious duty to take the vaccine, and religious leaders are the ones to convey this message.</p>

<p>The two most important contributions religious leaders might make in any societal crisis are to maintain a sense of perspective and to offer a non-anxious presence throughout the community.</p>
<p>I take basic pastoral care to the afflicted and their loved ones as a given, pandemic or no pandemic.</p>
<p>We must never lose sight of the sad reality of the number of young people and children who have lost their lives as a result of the H1N1 virus, but it is difficult to be charitable to those in the media and other walks of public life who have whipped up a frenzy of hysteria over this illness.</p>
<p>In consequence of the public fear generated by constant and often contradictory coverage of this particular flu strain -- a variety of which has apparently visited us before, in 1957 -- we have witnessed the unseemly spectacle of a mad rush for vaccine on a first-come first-served basis, leaving those who are the most vulnerable untreated and at risk.</p>
<p>We have been advised to cough into our sleeves and to avoid human contact when the virus -- according to the provincial health authorities -- lives but 15 minutes on flesh but up to 12 hours on cloth and 24 hours on hard surfaces such as doorknobs.</p>
<p>We are being taught to fear our neighbour.</p>
<p>Any death toll is sad, but just over 3,000 identifiable H1N1 deaths worldwide in a year isn't quite the same as 20,000 child deaths every day from malaria, which is totally eradicable at little cost.</p>
<p>Religious leaders can encourage the telling of truth: about H1N1, about malaria, and about the fact that no one gets out of life alive. We can urge reflection on meaning and mortality even when the media neglects to remind us.</p>
<p>And if Jesus could touch lepers, we should at least be willing to shake hands.</p>
