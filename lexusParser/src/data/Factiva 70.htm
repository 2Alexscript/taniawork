<p>As health experts scramble to understand the implications of a swine flu outbreak rippling across the globe from Mexico, one word is on many lips: pandemic.</p>
<p>Some might think it's an overreaction, but given that 149 deaths have been linked to the new strain of flu in Mexico, and there are confirmed cases in Canada, the U.S. and Europe, it's prudent to consider a "worst-case" scenario.</p>
<p>"We are preparing as if this is a pandemic. However, it may fade out. We're not sure," Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer, Dr. Moira</p>
<p>McKinnon, said Monday as she announced three suspected swine flu cases in the province.</p>
<p>Adding to the growing concern, The World Health Organization (WHO) raised its pandemic alert status to 4 (on a scale of 1-6), which "indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic, but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a forgone conclusion."</p>
<p>If human-to-human transmission is confirmed in at least two countries, the threat level would move to 5, indicating a pandemic was "imminent".</p>
<p>Statistically, the world is "due" a pandemic. They occur at least twice each century. In the 20th century there were three:</p>
<p>- 1918-19: Spanish flu killed an estimated 50 million.</p>
<p>- 1957-58: Asian flu claimed up to two million lives.</p>
<p>- 1968-69: Hong Kong flu killed about 700,000 people.</p>
<p>The world has had 40 years to prepare for the next pandemic, and the WHO says almost 150 countries -- including Canada -- have drawn up contingency plans. Anti-viral drugs that can mitigate the effects of a new flu strain have been stockpiled, though it's estimated it would take up to three months to produce a vaccine to prevent illness. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control is already working on a swine flu vaccine.</p>
<p>In addition to its planning, Canada's experience with the 2003 SARS virus, which killed 44 people and sickened hundreds, has given the health system practical experience that could prove useful if there is a pandemic.</p>
<p>The dark side of this picture is the fact that a global pandemic would hit the most vulnerable hardest -- in the Third World. In Africa, for example, there are generally poor medical services and a shortage of laboratory testing facilities.</p>
<p>While health concerns must take priority, the economic impact of a pandemic on a shaky global economy can't be ignored. Millions would be unable to work and travel would be curtailed.</p>
<p>There's no need for panic. But there is need for vigilance and preparation.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level a notch Monday amid a worldwide battle against the swine-flu outbreak, while Canadian health officials warned to expect more cases and likely some deaths in Canada.</p>
<p>As cases were confirmed for the first time in Spain and Scotland, the WHO raised its pandemic alert phase to four from three, on a scale of one to six. It's the first time the pandemic alert has attained that level since the world health agency created the system in 2005.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, WHO officials cautioned a flu pandemic is not "inevitable."</p>
<p>"What this can really be interpreted as is a significant step toward pandemic influenza but also it is a phase which says that we are not there yet. In other words, at this time we think that we have taken a step in that direction but a pandemic is not considered inevitable at this time," said Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general of health security at the WHO.</p>
<p>In Canada, the number of confirmed cases remained at six Monday: four in Nova Scotia and two in British Columbia.</p>
<p>"We have no new confirmed cases to date and all existing cases have recovered completely from their mild symptoms," Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer said in a release Monday evening.</p>
<p>Symptoms in the Canadian cases have been milder than those in Mexico, where 20 deaths due to swine flu have been confirmed.</p>
<p>One Canadian health official warned the public the worst could be yet to come.</p>
<p>"Simply because we're seeing mild symptoms so far does not mean we can take this for granted. We will likely see more cases, we will likely see more severe illnesses and we will likely, unfortunately, see some deaths as well," Butler-Jones said in Ottawa, earlier in the day.</p>
<p>"We hope not. But that is a normal part of an influenza outbreak of any type."</p>
<p>Another infectious disease authority didn't see the deadly outbreak some had feared.</p>
<p>"It's not the killer pandemic strain, at least on the surface without more information, that we would have feared," said Dr. Gerald Evans, president of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada."If it's a pandemic, it may not be one associated with that horrendously huge mortality that was seen with previous ones."</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Canada had begun implementing its national flu-pandemic plan, with officials stepping up surveillance for flu cases and government scientists rushing to develop a vaccine.</p>
<p>The federal government also took additional steps to protect travellers and "has issued a health-alert notice to the airlines that they are now distributing," Aglukkaq said in a release Monday night. "In addition, airlines are making onboard announcements to advise travellers of health precautions. The situation is evolving and we will remain vigilant and continue to monitor the situation closely."</p>
<p>As the number of cases doubled in the United States, Washington declared a public health emergency and warned Americans to avoid non-essential travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>But while Ottawa emphasized its efforts to co-ordinate plans with the U.S. and Mexico, Canadian officials were still weighing whether to follow the U.S. and issue a travel advisory against Mexico.</p>
<p>In Mexico, where the outbreak is believed to have originated earlier this month, officials continued to raise their estimate of the death toll. There are 20 confirmed deaths in Mexico, and officials estimate the toll could rise to 149.</p>

<p>One of the first Canadians to catch the swine flu at first thought it was just a case of heat stroke.</p>
<p>Ryan, who lives in the Vancouver suburb of Richmond, B.C., became tired and light-headed on the last day of his Mexican vacation.</p>
<p>On the plane home the next day, "I was freezing cold. I was wrapped in two blankets and flight attendants gave me hot chocolate and hot water bottles."</p>
<p>On the weekend, the 26-year-old learned he's one of six Canadians -- two from B.C. and four from Nova Scotia -- with a confirmed case of swine flu, an illness that has caused more than 100 deaths in Mexico since an outbreak was reported last week.</p>
<p>"How's that for my odds?" he said from his home on Monday, during his last day of quarantine. "Why couldn't I win the lottery?"</p>
<p>Ryan said he flew to Cancun on April 14 with a friend, but began feeling sick before his return flight last Wednesday.</p>
<p>When he got home, he spent the next two days bedridden with all the symptoms of the common flu, only worse. He also had trouble breathing.</p>
<p>He described swine flu as like four days of the worse case of food poisoning imaginable.</p>
<p>"It's the sickest I've been," he said.</p>
<p>By Friday morning, with his symptoms persisting, he was quarantined in a local hospital for blood tests and chest X-rays.</p>
<p>Ryan was sent home the same day and told to stay there and wear a mask.</p>
<p>He said hospital staff initially told him it was unlikely he had swine flu because he had not visited a danger area, such as Mexico City. But the following day, the hospital told him he had tested positive for an unidentified subtype of influenza A. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control on Sunday confirmed it was swine flu.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Outbreak has similarities to 1918 pandemic</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>489 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Ominous similarities exist between the swine flu and the 1918 pandemic virus that killed millions around the globe, from a shared "death profile" of 20-to-40-year-olds to an ability to spread rapidly among humans, experts say.</p>
<p>Some warn the swine flu outbreak has all the hallmarks of a pandemic. Others say it may be no worse than normal flu.</p>
<p>The confirmed death toll in Mexico is 20, with a likely total of 149 deaths, according to a national health ministry spokesman. There are now 40 confirmed cases in the United States, all mild, in five states. Six "mild" cases have been reported in Canada but that number could rise as officials await test results from several provinces.</p>
<p>No one can predict whether the swine flu is capable of morphing into a strain capable of unleashing a severe global pandemic.</p>
<p>"The bottom line is, we really don't know," says Dr. Brian Ward, an expert on viruses, vaccines and pandemics at McGill University in Montreal.</p>
<p>Experts don't know because important numbers are still missing. No one knows how prevalent the illness is. There could be millions of infected people in Mexico, with only the most severe cases ending up in a clinic or hospital, meaning what we're seeing is only the severe end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>"If it's 80 deaths on a background of 2,000 cases, that's really, really bad," says Ward, associate director of The Research Institute of McGill University Health Centre. "If it's 80 deaths and 1,300 hospitalized on a background of 10 million, it's still perhaps worse than the seasonal flu and a funny pattern. But it's not the same kind of hair-raising scenarios that the former numbers would lead you to believe."</p>
<p>Health authorities have been fearing an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu for years, and the only reason they haven't pressed the panic button is that it has never shown the ability to pass easily from human to human, Ward says.</p>
<p>The virus in Mexico, and now other places, "clearly has that capacity," meaning it has much greater pandemic potential than bird flu.</p>
<p>Swine flu normally spreads from pig to pig. Occasionally it will spread from pig to human. "This particular version has mutated so that it's able to transmit from person to person," says James Scott, a professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health and an expert in the airborne movement of germs.</p>
<p>"If you always need proximity to a pig in order to catch the disease, I'd feel pretty safe in downtown Toronto because we don't have a lot of pigs. But if it starts transmitting from human to human, I get a little more worried."</p>
<p>Scott says the virus is the same type as the 1918 strain.</p>

<p>In terms of the swine flu's impact on excursions from Saskatchewan to Mexico, local travel agencies say it couldn't have come at a better time.</p>
<p>"It's off-season travel now for Mexico. People are heading to Europe," said Jean Hammerlindl, owner of The Art of Travel in Regina. "If this would have happened in December, January, it would have (had) considerably more impact on our clients."</p>
<p>Agencies say there are no more charter flights from Saskatchewan to Mexico this season, so the closest ones would leave from Calgary or Edmonton.</p>
<p>While most agencies reported no ticket cancellations, a representative from CAA Saskatchewan Travel Agency on Quance Street said one person asked if it's all right to travel to Mexico, and wondered if planned tours would be in areas the flu has hit hard.</p>
<p>"We just called their tour company directly and they said so far everything was still a go and whatnot, but told them to keep their ears out," said travel agent Luana Wingert, adding that a 1-800 number was provided to acquire more information.</p>
<p>At the Regina airport, copies of a provincial health ministry information sheet on symptoms and treatment were being offered to departing and arriving passengers, said acting CEO Derrick Thue.</p>
<p>Although airport staff and passengers are clearly aware of the situation, "it's business as usual," he said.</p>
<p>Travel agencies say the situation is being monitored carefully through websites such as the Public Health Agency of Canada (www.phac-aspc.gc.ca[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca]) and the World Health Organization (www.who.int[http://www.who.int.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca]).</p>
<p>"If we had somebody that's, say, going to be travelling toward the end of May, we would just encourage them, between them and us, to continue to monitor the public health agency website because that is the heartbeat and that's where all the new information is," said Hammerlindl.</p>
<p>Both WestJet and Air Canada have issued travel advisories for passengers.</p>
<p>On Sunday, WestJet said guests travelling to and from Mexico up to April 30 can change or cancel the flights at no charge, and travel at a later date.</p>
<p>Air Canada announced Monday that due to the outbreak of influenza in Mexico City, it will waive change fees for customers who plan to travel to or from the city at a future date. This applies to travel arrangements up to May 6.</p>

</div><div>Annie McLeod   </div>

</p>
<p>There are no known connections between Saskatchewan hogs and the swine flu, and it's business as usual, said the province's pork industry Monday.</p>
<p>"There's always people that are misinformed and don't realize that there's no connection between the people and animals at all, but that's the fact of the matter," said Neil Ketilson, general manager of Sask Pork.</p>
<p>He said Sask Pork has been contacted by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the provincial veterinarian to make sure that everything in the Saskatchewan pork industry is OK. Additionally, the organization has been in contact with the Canadian Pork Council and there has been no inclination of reducing, or changing, the imports and exports of pork.</p>
<p>"From the purity, quality point of view, there's no reason to suspect there'd be any issues at all," said Ketilson. "If, in fact, this thing prolongs and gets worse, then of course we'll have to consider what the implications are from a perceptual point of view, but in terms of Canada, there's nothing to be concerned about in terms of the quality."</p>
<p>The CFIA stated on Monday that the Public Health Agency of Canada is the lead agency on the issue because it relates to human health and has not presented itself as an animal health matter.</p>
<p>"At this point, there are no signs of increased disease or death in Canadian swine. However, as a precaution, the CFIA is asking producers, veterinarians and labs to increase their vigilance in monitoring for and reporting swine disease," its website said Monday.</p>
<p>The agency's website also stated that swine influenza is not a food safety concern.</p>
<p>"On behalf of the producers in the province, we have either been in contact, or contacted by, the provincial (veterinarian and) the CFIA -- and we've done this at both the provincial and national levels -- just as a monitoring effort," said Ketilson. "There's absolutely nothing that people need to be concerned about with respect to the consumption of pork and/or working with the animals."</p>

<p>Just after Dr. David Butler-Jones became Canada's chief public health officer, he promised Canadians the truth, as he saw it.</p>
<p>"The last thing people need is somebody saying 'everything is fine' when it's not. But at the same time, to say 'everybody is going to die!' is also not helpful," said Butler-Jones, who spent seven years as Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer. "It really is ensuring people have the best information, communicated clearly -- no cover-ups, absolute transparency about what the issues are and what the information is."</p>
<p>Today, he's one of the most visible public servants in Canada, overseeing the federal response to the emerging outbreak of swine flu.</p>
<p>The entire nation will see what Saskatchewan saw a decade ago: a guy who's smart, cool under fire and a good communicator.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones was born in 1953 in Toronto and earned a medical degree from the University of Toronto in 1978, adding a degree in community health and epidemiology in 1982.</p>
<p>He was chief public health officer in northern Ontario's Algoma district before taking an equivalent position in Barrie, Ont. in 1986. He came to Saskatchewan in 1995.</p>
<p>"He's quite eloquent, particularly in front of a camera," said John Wright, Saskatchewan's former deputy health minister -- who didn't work directly with Butler-Jones in Regina, but did so later, after Butler-Jones had taken up his federal job. "He has a bit of a gift of being able to take a complex subject and put it into simple terms."</p>
<p>He stepped down in 2002 to focus on clinical and teaching work, but also acted as medical health officer for the Sunrise Health Region in southeast Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>Then came the 2003 SARS outbreak that killed more than 40 Canadians (mostly in Toronto) and 800 worldwide.</p>
<p>The federal government created a position akin to what existed in Saskatchewan. Having served on the National Advisory Committee on SARS and Public Health, Butler Jones was picked to head it.</p>
<p>He saluted his political masters in Regina, saying, "every once in a while somebody would try to say, 'Lay off this restaurant because he's a good guy,' or whatever. And I'd say, 'Fine, go talk to the premier, and the premier will tell you to go talk to me.' "</p>
<p>Only two months ago, he told a Regina audience that federal agencies had made enormous strides in planning for a flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"It could be a mild one, just a little bit worse, but not a lot worse, than a regular flu year. Or it could be really nasty -- in which case, we need to be thinking through all of the possibilities," he said, explaining being prepared lets public health officials focus on the surprises, "because there will always be surprises."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccine researchers not worried ... yet</b>

<p>Vaccine researchers in Saskatoon are not panicking about the swine flu first detected in Mexico.</p>
<p>"Every year we go through the seasonal influenza thing, and those viruses come out of animals, both swine and poultry and we never worry about this sort of thing," said Andrew Potter, director of the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO) at the University of Saskatchewan. "This one seems to have captivated the public for some reason."</p>
<p>VIDO is a U of- research centre and a leader in the research and developers of vaccines for humans and animals. Researchers at VIDO have studied swine vaccines for many years, although not this particular strain.</p>
<p>Precautions should be taken, said Potter, but there is little researchers can do until the size and scope of the outbreak becomes clear.</p>
<p>"We don't know that there's a problem yet of any kind. It sounds like we have a virus that is transmitted fairly easily from person to person but it doesn't seem to make them all that sick," he said. "Right now we just don't have the information to say 'this is the big one.' "</p>
<p>All influenza viruses are related, said Potter, and technology used for vaccine development can be applied to any strain.</p>
<p>VIDO Researcher Yan Zhou has developed a technique of making any flu vaccine very quickly. By replicating the process by which strains of flu develop in animals, Zhou can create a vaccine for any strain in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>Getting such a vaccine out to the public is a "totally different scenario," said Potter. VIDO does not have the capacity to manufacture vaccines on a larger scale.</p>
<p>In Mexico more than 1,600 influenza-like cases were reported and at least 20 deaths from the new strain confirmed, which could rise to 149. Specimens examined at the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg tested positive for swine flu virus.</p>
<p>California and Texas had the first reported cases outside Mexico and the U.S. has declared a public health emergency Sunday. Further cases were confirmed in Canada and Spain and suspected cases in New Zealand, France, Israel and Brazil were also found.</p>
<p>The influenza type A H1N1, is thought to be a mixture of swine, bird and human viruses.</p>
<p>According to the Saskatoon Health Region, it is up to the government to dictate a plan to deal with any potential outbreak.</p>
<p>The Health Region will follow the direction of Moira McKinnon, the province's chief medical health officer. Travel agencies in Saskatoon are also keeping a close eye on the situation, though most travel to Mexico has already wrapped up for the season.</p>
<p>Only one charter flight remains, returning from Mexico Saturday. Otherwise, flights, arrivals and departures from the airport are normal.</p>
<p>The situation would have to get "very severe" before flights were cancelled, said a spokesperson with the Saskatoon Airport Authority.</p>
<p>So far there is "absolutely nothing" that would lead the airport to believe they need to cancel flights, said Maxine Montgomery, with the Saskatoon Airport Authority.</p>
<p>"The only precaution that would be taken is if we were notified there were individuals on board showing flu-like symptoms," she said.</p>
<p>The majority of clients who do go to Mexico visit tourist areas, none of which have reported incidences of flu, said Sandi Levinton, manager at Marlin Travel in Saskatoon.</p>
<p>They are keeping an eye on the situation to see what happens. So far the government has not issued a travel advisory.</p>
<p>Levinton has no clients travelling to Mexico within the next week. Generally trips are non-refundable, though most travel insurance would cover last-minute cancellations. Ultimately it's "better to be safe than sorry," she said.</p>

<div>944 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Saskatchewan is readying for potential swine flu cases as the world waits to see how the respiratory illness unfolds.</p>
<p>Although there were no confirmed cases in the province as of Monday evening, politicians and health officials reassured the public that plans are in place to handle an outbreak should one develop.</p>
<p>"We expect that we'll have a lot of people under investigation that we'll have to do lab tests on. We don't know how many will be positive but it's probable we will at some stage get a case," Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer Dr. Moira McKinnon told reporters gathered at the T.C. Douglas building in Regina, where the health ministry has set up an "operations centre" to monitor the evolving swine flu situation.</p>
<p>The province is awaiting results of lab tests for three people in the Cypress, Five Hills and Prince Albert Parkland health regions who showed symptoms of possible swine flu, while another five people have tested negative. The individuals waiting for results of lab tests, which must be confirmed in Winnipeg, are all resting at home, McKinnon said.</p>
<p>She emphasized that the six cases of swine flu confirmed in B.C. and Nova Scotia have all been "mild," as have the cases in the U.S., unlike in Mexico where it is suspected in more than 100 deaths.</p>
<p>The province is preparing "as if this is a pandemic," but the situation might instead fizzle out, she said.</p>
<p>Ten people are staffing the central operations centre, set up Friday, to gather infection control information, assess how the stockpile of anti-virals could be mobilized if needed, provide information to travellers and keep up-to-date on the latest developments. Individual health regions are also setting up their own operations centres.</p>
<p>"I would just reassure people that the ministry is on top of it, we are monitoring it and let's certainly hope that we don't have any confirmed cases but in the event that we do I think that the Ministry of Health and the regions are positioned very well," said Health Minister Don McMorris.</p>
<p>An information sheet is being given to visitors at airports, alerting them to "clusters of severe respiratory illness" in Mexico being tracked by the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>McKinnon said potential swine flu cases involve people who develop influenza-like illness -- with symptoms such as fever and cough -- within 10 days of returning from Mexico and those who get sick after being in contact with others from Mexico who are unwell.</p>
<p>The province is asking people to see their family physicians or call the HealthLine at 1-877-800-0002 if they have concerns. Only nine people called the line with influenza-related inquiries on Sunday, McKinnon said.</p>
<p>People are encouraged to wash their hands frequently with soap and water, or use alcohol-based hand gel, as a prevention tool. McKinnon said people should also cough or sneeze in the crook of their elbow, rather than their hands, to prevent the spread of influenza.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan has been preparing for a "moderate pandemic" for a few years, so if that such an event were to occur plans would be ready, she said. There is also a stockpile of anti-virals that would be enough to treat the people that estimates suggest could fall ill in that scenario, she said.</p>
<p>Regina, too, has been involved in planning for the possibility a pandemic might one day occur, including how the services important to the public would continue to be provided, said Grant Nicurity, deputy of public safety, planning and prevention for the City of Regina's fire and protective services.</p>
<p>"If this or any other influenza outbreak were to escalate what we really have to do is switch into more of a business continuity mode," he said, adding the city would be directed by health authorities as action was warranted.</p>
<p>But he also urged people not to panic as media attention worldwide centres on the swine flu.</p>
<p>"The sky is not falling yet," he said.</p>
<p>"What we're really doing right now is due diligence."</p>
<p>Also watching the swine flu developments is the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO), which has been doing research and developing swine flu vaccinations for pigs, as well as work related to humans, said director Andy Potter.</p>
<p>"It's very early days," said Potter, who noted the mortality rate has not been that high. "We'll have to wait and see but everything I've seen, the cases in Canada, the cases in the U.S., would suggest that maybe we don't have too worry too much."</p>
<p>BRIEFING</p>
<p>- Swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by the type A influenza virus.</p>
<p>- The symptoms of swine flu in people can be similar to the symptoms of regular human seasonal influenza infection and include fever, cough, headache, general aches, fatigue and other symptoms.</p>
<p>- Some people with swine flu also have reported runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>

<p>PUERTO VALLARTA, Mexico --The smiling airline clerk at the Puerto Vallarta Airport check-in counter looks at the 2.5-metre-long tandem bicycle and raises her eyebrows. My wife, Charlotte Hunt, and I have just finished a short tandem trip in the region, and we are bringing our behemoth of a bike home.</p>
<p>"How much did you pay in extra baggage fees to fly with that from Edmonton to Puerto Vallarta?" she asks, as she examines our unusual piece of "luggage." Nada. Nothing. We didn't pay a peso. The clerk does a bit of checking and discovers to her surprise that indeed bikes fly free on Skyservice flights. It might cost $5 for a pillow in the aircraft's cabin, but our 20-kilogram bike, stowed away in the cargo hold next to suitcases bulging with sunscreen and bathing suits, doesn't cost us a thing.</p>
<p>Charlotte and I are on our way home from my third cycling trip to Mexico in two years. On past trips, we cycled around Isla Mujeres, a sand spit of an island near Cancun, and I did a solo trip from Cancun down the Mayan Rivera to Tulum. This Puerto Vallarta trip was the first time we would ride the tandem straight from the airport to our final destination.</p>
<p>We arrive at the Puerto Vallarta Airport in the middle of the afternoon after a very early departure from Edmonton. The 6 a.m. departure means little sleep the night before, but it does give us reason to count on enough daylight in Mexico to reach our destination. We plan to ride 40 kilometres north to Sayulita, a coastal town on the other side of the mountains from the airport.</p>
<p>As the aircraft comes in for a landing, Charlotte and I clearly see the serpentine road we will soon be peddling on.</p>
<p>At the airport, we awkwardly pull the tandem from the luggage carousel to a quiet corner of the airport to get the bike ready for the ride. Before leaving Edmonton we had wrapped the bike in a long heavy plastic bag for protection.</p>
<p>We stow the bag on our rear rack, pump up the tires, make a costume change in the airport bathroom into cycling clothes and we're ready to ride to Sayulita.</p>
<p>Other than the little drawing in our guidebook, we don't have a proper map. We don't really need one, however, since Highway 200 goes pretty much straight from the PV Airport to Sayulita. "Keep the Pacific to your left and we'll be fine,"Charlotte says as we head out.</p>
<p>The route from the airport to the foot of the mountains is clogged with traffic, much of it trying to drive on the wide shoulder with us. One of the wonders of bike commuting at home is that you never get caught in traffic, since there's always a couple of feet on the shoulder to slowly squeeze past the gridlock. Not here. In front of the <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, the traffic is so dense we are actually stuck for a while. Eventually, traffic thins out, giving us lots of room on the wide shoulder.</p>
<p>Not a lot to marvel at for the first 25 kilometres, but suddenly, as if we pedalled from one world into another, we are surrounded by thick towering jungle and a long hill in front of us. At the same time, the marked shoulder disappears and four lanes of traffic narrow to two. The climb continues for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>On the flat highway out of the airport we were averaging 26 km/h; now we are doing about nine. The traffic is heavy, but moving slowly up the mountain. We have to get to Sayulita before dark because riding on a narrow highway at night on a mountain road is not a good idea. We now only have about an hour before sunset.</p>
<p>Finally, we round a curve and start the fast descent to Sayulita. The downhill is nail-biting since the traffic is moving faster, and the potholes and steep embankment are more menacing at 45 km/h than they were at nine km/h. We can't afford to slow down too much since it is getting dark.</p>
<p>Charlotte is really afraid since she is on the back of the bike, hoping I can handle the speed, traffic and unpredictable road. As the stoker on a tandem, she can't brake or steer; going downhill, the stoker just hangs on tight and sometimes even closes her eyes.</p>
<p>We arrive in Sayulita with time to spare and find our hotel at the top of yet another hill.</p>
<p>For the next seven days, we go on relaxing little excursions from Sayulita by bike.</p>
<p>On our way back to the Puerto Vallarta Airport, we spend the day on a slightly longer, less-travelled route through Punta Mita. We take a long break on the vast and almost empty beach at Litibu, riding on the firm, packed, golden sand, chasing the waves as they move back and forth, just missing our wheels.</p>
<p>We're just starting our ride out of Punta Mita when a Mexican hotel worker lording over his hotel parking lot sees our long tandem and smiles. "We have free limousine parking," he calls to us, as we wave goodbye.</p>
<p>For cycle-touring aficionados, our tandem trips on Isla Mujeres and Puerto Vallarta may seem rather pedestrian, but my solo one-week cycling trip from Cancun to Tulum is worthy of my earning a few cycle-touring stripes.</p>
<p>This time, I pack a tent and ride much farther than my trips in Mexico with Charlotte. The coastal highway between Cancun and Tulum is great for cycling, mostly because the highway has a very wide shoulder and is seldom used by Mexican drivers. I feel like it's all mine.</p>
<p>On the way to Tulum, I tent overnight on the grounds of a scruffy hotel in Playa Del Carmen. The next day, on my way to Tulum, I discover Cenote Tankah -- a fresh water sinkhole -- and have the most refreshing swim of my life.</p>
<p>Most tourists visit big privately run cenotes, but Tankah is modest, free -- and there's no one else around. You have to have a bike or a car to get here.</p>
<p>Just down the highway from Tankah, I find a campsite for $9 per night in the shade of a huge tree at a campground/cabana operation on the Tulum beach called Mar Caribe.</p>
<p>Tulum's beach area is a 10-km strip of small hotels and restaurants, but the town and all other services are about 15 km from the campground.</p>
<p>Without a bike, a visit to town would mean trying to find a</p>
<p>cab or a bus (they are rare)</p>
<p>or walk. On my bike, I zip into the centre of town in 20 minutes. Part of the road has a gravel bike path and Tulum even has dedicated bikeways in town.</p>
<p>On my last day in Tulum, I crawl out of my sleeping sheet and pack up my tent at dawn to start the 110-km ride straight to the Cancun Airport.</p>
<p>It rains lightly for most of the day, so when I arrive at the airport around 4 p.m., I'm soaked. Before I check in, I slip into the bathroom, open my waterproof bike pannier and change into dry clothes before wrapping the bike in its big plastic bag. Me, my bike and my dry socks are ready to fly home.</p>
<p>If you take your bike . . .</p>
<p>- To take a bike on a flight, let the air out of the tires, turn the handlebars in, take the pedals off and put the bike in either a box or a big plastic bag.</p>
<p>- The plastic bag option is easier since you don't have to find another box on the return trip. A plastic bag can be rolled up and reused on the return trip.</p>
<p>- During the winter, the main carriers from Canada to Mexico are WestJet, <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span> and Skyservice. Bikes ride free on <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span> and Skyservice flights, while WestJet allows one bike per passenger but may charge for excess weight.</p>

<p>TORONTO -- Canadian stocks were hit hard yesterday, as mounting fears of a major swine-flu outbreak placed new doubts on an already-fragile global economy.</p>
<p>The S&P/TSX composite index lost 154.68 points, or 1.62 per cent, to 9,394.80, as losers outpaced gainers by more than three to one and eight sub-indexes ended the day in negative territory.</p>
<p>It was the first losing session for Canada's main exchange since last Monday when it fell more than 300 points.</p>
<p>The TSX Venture exchange also snapped a winning streak, losing 3.83 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 1,002.98. The dollar was down 67 basis points to 82 cents US.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the effect of swine flu on markets was less pronounced as investors turned their thoughts to some positive developments in the U.S. auto sector. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 51.29 points or 0.64 per cent to 8,025.</p>
<p>The S&P 500 lost 8.72 points or 1.01 per cent to 857.51 and the Nasdaq composite index closed at 1,679.41, down 14.88 points or 0.88 per cent.</p>
<p>"Increased public awareness over the possibility of a major swine-flu pandemic appears to have raised a number of</p>
<p>concerns among investors," said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets Canada.</p>
<p>"Trading [yesterday] seems to suggest that fears have increased that a major flu epidemic may keep people at home and impact business and leisure-travel demand, consumer spending, and demand for pork products. On the other hand, it also appears that a pandemic may increase demand for vaccines and medical diagnostic tools."</p>
<p>In Toronto, the air-travel group was hit particularly hard, with <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. and Air Canada, both down more than five per cent and tour operator Transat A.T down more than 10 per cent.</p>
<p>Cieszynski added that commodities also took a hit as oil prices fell $1.41 US to $50.14 a barrel, copper prices fell slightly and gold dropped $5.90 US to $908.20 an ounce. As a result, energy and materials stocks were down 1.87 per cent and 2.01 per cent, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Maple Leaf Foods</span>, meanwhile, held up relatively well on the day, despite concerns surrounding pork products. The food services company lost just four cents in mild trading, to close at $8.45.</p>

</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY -- A 5.6-magnitude earthquake hit southern Mexico yesterday, shaking buildings far away in Mexico's flu-hit capital, but there were no major reports of deaths or damage.</p>
<p>A woman died of a heart attack near the quake's epicentre in the southern state of Guerrero, home to the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco, officials said, but there were no other casualties reported.</p>
<p>"It felt really strong here. There's been no one hurt or killed. We're monitoring the situation,'' said Marcos Gonzalez, a civil protection official in the city of Chilpancingo near the epicentre.</p>
<p>The tremor was felt in Mexico City, around 240 kilometres away, and hundreds of people evacuated buildings. Most of them wore surgical face masks as protection against a swine-flu outbreak that has killed up to 149 people in Mexico.</p>
<p>The U.S. Geological Survey revised the quake's magnitude down to 5.6 from 6.0 initially. Quakes of magnitude 5.6 are classified as moderate, capable of causing slight damage to buildings.</p>
<p>There was no major damage in Mexico City, a sprawling metropolis of around 20 million people, many of whom remember the devastating 1985 earthquake that killed thousands of people.</p>
<p>"It was quite strong. I was eating a sandwich in a cafe and my table started shaking,'' said Luis Fernandez, 35, a lawyer who was sitting with a crowd of evacuees in the city centre. "But it wasn't that bad. I stayed and finished my coffee.''</p>
<p>The tremor hit as many people in the city were huddled at home because of the flu outbreak, which has grown into a major global health scare.</p>
<p>Office workers raced outside after the quake, but were visibly anxious about finding themselves in a crowd. "I'm a bag of nerves,'' said cellphone executive Xochitl Cortez, 33.</p>
<p>In Japan, a moderate 5.0-magnitude quake struck off the east coast of the main island of Honshu yesterday but there were no reports of casualties or damage.</p>
<p>The quake's epicentre was 44 km east-northeast of the city of Mito and 142 km northeast of Tokyo, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It was about 41 km beneath the sea floor but no tsunami warning was issued.</p>

</div><div>Canwest News Service</div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level a notch yesterday amid a worldwide battle against the swine-flu outbreak, while Canadians were warned to expect more cases and likely some deaths.</p>
<p>As cases were confirmed for the first time in Spain and Scotland, the WHO raised its pandemic alert phase from three to four on a scale of one to six.</p>
<p>It's the first time the pandemic alert has reached that level since the world health agency created the system in 2005.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, WHO officials cautioned a flu pandemic is not "inevitable."</p>
<p>"What this can really be interpreted as is a significant step toward pandemic influenza, but also it is a phase which says that we are not there yet," said Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general of health security at the WHO.</p>
<p>In Canada, the number of confirmed cases remained at six yesterday -- two in B.C. and four in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Symptoms in the Canadian cases have been milder than those in Mexico, where 149 deaths due to swine flu are suspected, although only 20 have been confirmed.</p>
<p>However, Canadian health officials warned the public the worst could yet be to come.</p>
<p>"Simply because we're seeing mild symptoms so far does not mean we can take this for granted. We will likely see more cases, we will likely see more severe illnesses and we will likely, unfortunately, see some deaths as well," Chief Public Health Officer David Butler-Jones told reporters in Ottawa.</p>
<p>"We hope not. But that is a normal part of an influenza outbreak of any type."</p>
<p>As the number of flu cases doubled in the U.S., Washington declared a public-health emergency and warned Americans to avoid non-essential travel to Mexico. Canadian officials were still weighing whether to do the same.</p>
<p>"This is obviously a cause for concern and requires a heightened state of alert. But it is not a cause for alarm," said U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Some nations, such as India, Australia and Malaysia, were cautioning their citizens about visiting countries where cases have been confirmed, including Canada.</p>
<p>Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan called travel advisories against Canada an "overreaction."</p>
<p>In Mexico, where the outbreak is believed to have originated earlier this month, more than 700 people are being treated in hospital there for serious respiratory illnesses and 1,070 have been treated and discharged.</p>
<p>There are 40 confirmed cases in the United States, all mild, in five states -- New York, Ohio, Kansas, Texas and California.</p>

<p>Silvia Quintero, visiting Vancouver from Mexico with her husband and daughter, was relieved to remove her blue medical mask yesterday after landing.</p>
<p>"Here, the mask is not necessary," Quintero said.</p>
<p>She, and many others arriving at Vancouver International Airport, were wearing masks to try to avoid the swine flu that has killed at least 20 people in Mexico. Officials there estimate the number of dead at 149 as more than 700 people are being treated in hospital for serious respiratory illnesses.</p>
<p>Quintero's daughter, Lorena, said there has been tension in the country as news spread of a potential pandemic.</p>
<p>"There is panic. Everybody is getting worried," she said. "I am concerned. I stayed in my house. I was not going to places with a lot of people."</p>
<p>Fellow passenger Maggie Parsons had a mask dangling from her neck.</p>
<p>"I'm very concerned about my health. I spent six months in Mexico," said Parsons, who was relieved to be back home in Vancouver.</p>
<p>"Everything is closed in Mexico City or, rather, the big events such as churches and schools are shut down," she said as she exited through the arrivals area.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are no new confirmed cases of swine flu in B.C., although health officials are keeping a close eye on the situation.</p>
<p>Two Metro Vancouver men, aged 25 to 35, who had travelled in Mexico, are recovering from a mild case of the swine flu and did not require anti-viral treatment, said Dr. David Patrick, the B.C. Centre for Disease Control's director of epidemiology.</p>
<p>But he said officials are expecting there will be "other exports of this virus."</p>
<p>Patrick said the A, H1N1 flu strain responds to treatment with anti-viral drugs such as Tamiflu. B.C. has ample stockpiles.</p>
<p>"People should be reassured by that. This is a virus so far which is amenable to treatment with one particular class of antivirals, and we have hundreds of thousands of doses," he said.</p>
<p>Patrick said the single biggest thing people can do is to take themselves out of circulation for a week if they come down with a fever and a cough.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a West Vancouver woman who fell ill with flu-like symptoms after returning from her honeymoon in Mexico learned yesterday that she doesn't have the swine flu.</p>
<p>Anne Gavin, who is five months pregnant, said she was told that she had contracted the H5N1 or avian type of influenza A, which can range from typical influenza-like symptoms to severe complications.</p>
<p>"I am focused on my recovery and very relieved," she said yesterday.</p>
<p>Canada has not issued any restrictions or warnings about travel to Mexico, but some airlines, including Air Canada and WestJet, are offering would-be travellers to Mexico refunds on plane tickets.</p>

</p>
<p>What with the economic crisis, the fading fortunes in Afghanistan and now, the potential for a swine flu pandemic threatening the planet, it would be understandable if people concluded the end is near.</p>
<p>In fact, after Mexico City, which was reeling already from being the epicentre of the swine flu pandemic, was hit Monday by a strong earthquake, it wasn't hard to find people who believed the Apocalypse had begun.</p>
<p>The dismal world conditions had so discombobulated our national capital that, for a brief moment during Monday's question period, it looked as if Parliament was going to work just as it should in such times of crisis. When Opposition Leader Michael Ignatieff kicked off the session with three, well-considered and relevant questions about the government's response to the swine flu threat, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and Immigration Minister Jason Kenny actually took the unusual step of answering the questions respectfully and completely.</p>
<p>Mr. Ignatieff wanted to know how Canada would protect itself from a potential pandemic, what it was doing to address travel bans being enacted by countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia, and how this country would address the imminent influx of temporary farm workers from Mexico.</p>
<p>All good questions and, more importantly, ones that all got good answers. Ms. Aglukkaq pointed out the lessons learned during the 2003 SARS outbreak had been put into action and foreign government were being kept informed; Mr. Kenny said Mexican farm labourers would be required to have a medical checkup to make sure they exhibited no symptoms of the flu, or have had immediate contact with anyone who did.</p>
<p>To be sure, it didn't take long for the proper functioning of Parliament to run off the rails. But even as the politicians seem to have come up short, the rapidity with which the swine flu crisis has been addressed at the bureaucratic level illustrates that Canada is on the ball. Even before the U.S. Centres for Disease Control had issued a statement on the swine flu, Canada's pandemic plan was in place.</p>
<p>By mid-week, even hospitals in Saskatoon had received notice already of the potential for the disease to spread out of Mexico, that it seemed to be easily transmitted human to human like the flu, and that health workers in danger of coming into contact with the virus should be using the proper type of mask.</p>
<p>This contrasts nicely with the slow and isolated response when Canada became one of the top nations forced to deal with SARS. While the danger is clearly still strong, this change in tactics is a clear indication of the strength of the response network established in the wake of the SARS crisis.</p>
<p>And that the swine virus was identified early on at the national microbiology laboratory in Winnipeg for Mexico speaks well of the infrastructure Canada is assembling to deal with what everyone understands is inevitable.</p>
<p>It's also worth remembering that the health infrastructure is continuing to expand, for example with the construction on the University of Saskatchewan campus of the InterVac addition to the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, which will be used to help develop vaccines for such episodes.</p>
<p>The Canadian battle against this potential pandemic doesn't stop there. Just as VIDO helped to develop the defence against SARS, those institutions it worked with -- such as the Winnipeg lab and the Genome Sequence Centre in Vancouver -- are also back on the frontlines to make sure the new threat is minimized.</p>
<p>Such a co-ordinated national response, by the way, is a far superior means of battling a global epidemic than the tactic too often used by panicked countries such as China. Hong Kong, which was an epicentre for SARS, has returned to checking people's temperatures at one of the busiest international airports, thus disrupting global travel.</p>
<p>The European Union has recommended citizens of the region refrain from travelling to countries where the virus has been diagnosed, even though cases have been identified in Spain and Britain. Such panicky reactions only serve to discourage vulnerable countries from identifying the threat of similar outbreaks, or announcing it when they occur, for fear of the economic fallout.</p>
<p>It's too soon to predict the scope of this outbreak -- the deadly Spanish flu of 1918-1919 claimed an estimated 50 million lives and infected a third of the world's 1.5 billion people at the time. If one needs evidence the world isn't coming to an end this time, however, it should check with Canada and see the difference between the hype and the reality.</p>

<p>ROYALS THUMP JAYS</p>
<p>Brian Bannister gave up one hit over seven innings and Jose Guillen hit two homers to lead the Kansas City Royals over the Toronto Blue Jays 7-1 Monday night. The Blue Jays entered the game leading the majors in runs, batting average and slugging percentage, but Bannister limited them to Adam Lind's first-inning single. Bannister walked six, including five of the first 14 batters he faced.</p>
<p>CHELSEA PREPARES FOR TEST</p>
<p>Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink is expecting an open game against Barcelona but warned Monday that his team has to be alert to avoid a repeat of Bayern Munich's collapse against the Spanish side in the previous round. The Dutchman said he has watched videos of Barcelona's victory over Bayern at the Nou Camp where the Germans conceded four first-half goals. "We've studied that game and looked at what Bayern did wrong and it wasn't just the defence which was to blame but the whole team," Hiddink said.</p>
<p>NO CHANGES TO TRACK</p>
<p>NASCAR officials are not considering changing the racing surface at Talladega Superspeedway following a spectacular last-lap accident that sent debris flying into the grandstands. They will study several different safety standards, including the height of the fences surrounding the track and perhaps the need to be stricter about aggressive driving and blocking, when one car deliberately moves into the path of a competing car trying to pass it. Debris from the crash injured seven fans.</p>
<p>VARLAMOV SUPPORT</p>
<p>The Washington Capitals are convinced rookie netminder Simeon Varlamov has the talent and temperament to see them past the New York Rangers in the deciding game of their Eastern Conference series today (7 p.m., TSN). Varlamov has sparkled in goal since replacing Jose Theodore in Game 2 of the series but a pressure-packed Game 7 of a Stanley Cup quarter-final might be another matter.</p>
<p>NO SPECTATORS ALLOWED</p>
<p>The Canadian Tour event scheduled this week in Mexico will proceed, but no spectators will be allowed on the golf course to watch the tournament. Players are also prohibited from using local Mexican caddies at the San Luis Potosi Open in an effort to prevent the spread of the swine flu virus that has hit Mexico hard in the past week. About 40 Canadians are in the field at the US$125,000 event in north-central Mexico.</p>
<p>SKINNER SURVIVES RAIN</p>
<p>Mike Skinner waited through two days and two weather delays to win the rain-shortened O'Reilly Auto Parts 250 trucks race at Kansas Speedway. Skinner was in the lead when the race was postponed after 52 laps Saturday, lost the lead in the pits to defending champion Roy Hornaday Jr., then went back up front just before the second rain delay hit Monday. Skinner was in the pits when the race was called after 132 laps</p>
<p>PHILLIPS CITED FOR BATTERY</p>
<p>Chargers linebacker Shaun Phillips has been cited for misdemeanor battery for allegedly striking a security guard in the face at a downtown hotel early Sunday morning in San Diego. It is Phillips' second run-in with the law in three seasons.</p>
<p>AZAM CLEARED</p>
<p>Gloucester's French hooker Olivier Azam has escaped a ban after a charge of gouging was dismissed on a technicality. The forward had been cited for allegedly making contact with the eyes or eye area of Cardiff Blues' Jamie Roberts during the Anglo-Welsh Cup final April 18, which the Welsh side won 50-12.</p>
<p>BLAKE DEFEATED</p>
<p>America's James Blake was beaten 7-5, 6-3 by Romanian qualifier Victor Crivoi in the first round of the Rome Masters, where play was curtailed by rain and wind Monday. The 14th seed fought back to 5-5 after losing the first five games of the match but he failed to force a tiebreak.</p>

<p>A mutant superhero is no match for the swine flu that has killed up to 149 people in Mexico.</p>
<p>Hollywood movie studio 20th Century Fox said Monday it was scrapping plans to release X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the first big movie of the summer, in Mexico this weekend.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the studio said the Hugh Jackman action movie would probably be delayed by a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The outbreak has forced Mexico's top movie-theatre chains to shut down dozens of cinemas throughout the nation's capital, part of a push by authorities to limit large public gatherings that could facilitate the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>Wolverine is still on schedule to open virtually everywhere else in the world this weekend. The following weekend, Star Trek flies into 50 markets, including Mexico. A spokeswoman for the film's distributor, <span class="companylink">Paramount Pictures</span>, was not immediately available to comment on a possible new release date.</p>

<p>Greenhouse owners and vegetable and fruit growers are worried the offshore worker program could be temporarily halted by the outbreak of Mexican swine flu.</p>
<p>About two-thirds of the 5,000 migrant workers who come to Essex County for months at a time are from Mexico.</p>
<p>Larry Verbeke, a vice-president of the Essex County Federation of Agriculture, said a majority of the Mexican workers needed by local farmers are likely already here.</p>
<p>However, he said another influx would be expected in several months.</p>
<p>Small numbers of migrant workers are always leaving and arriving as well, Verbeke said.</p>
<p>So far, Canadian federal health and agriculture officials are content with increased medical screening of Mexican workers before they leave for Canada, and no limits have been put on the offshore worker program.</p>
<p>Across Canada, about 20,000 offshore workers are recruited annually for greenhouses, vegetable and fruit farms in Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia.</p>
<p>They come from Central America and Jamaica, as well as Mexico.</p>
<p>Leamington Deputy Mayor Rob Schmidt, also a farmer, said there's concern among local residents about the Mexican swine flu, given the large number of Mexican nationals, but "nobody's panicking.</p>
<p>"People are waiting to see what's going to happen," Schmidt said.</p>
<p>Bernard Nelson, a Kingsville dairy farmer and president of the Essex County Federation of Agriculture, expects the Mexican swine flu will be closely watched in this area because of the numbers of migrant workers from that country.</p>
<p>"That's the first thing I thought of," he said when he heard about the flu.</p>
<p>Since the 1960s, offshore workers have done farm work across Canada that Canadians frequently shun. They typically make $9 to $12 an hour, depending on the type of work.</p>
<p>HOSPITAL STEPS</p>
<p>WHAT TO DO</p>
<p>With the World Health Organization raising the alert level on swine flu to a Phase 4 public health emergency, Windsor Regional Hospital is asking all its visitors two questions: Are you experiencing a new or worsening cough or shortness of breath? Are you feverish?</p>
<p>Visitors who answer yes to either or both of the above questions are advised not to visit family and friends at the hospital. Instead, they should seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Patients who answer yes to either question will be asked to wear a mask to their appointments.</p>
<p>WRH said the steps are necessary as part of worldwide efforts to stem the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>According to WRH, a Phase 4 health alert means the virus is becoming increasingly adept at spreading among humans.</p>

<p>No cases have been confirmed yet in Ontario but the outbreak of a potentially fatal swine flu from Mexico has local, provincial and federal officials taking quick steps to limit the spread, Windsor-Essex Medical Officer of Health Dr. Allen Heimann said Monday.</p>
<p>Along with local vacationers returning from Mexico recently, the thousands of migrant Mexican farm workers in the Leamington area are a particular concern here, Heimann told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said a temporary halt to the arrivals of additional Mexican workers is under consideration by federal officials.</p>
<p>There are too many Mexican workers in the Leamington area to screen them all, Heimann said. Those who have been in Canada for months and are healthy are not a risk to anyone, he said.</p>
<p>The concern is mainly to make sure recent arrivals from Mexico have no flu symptoms, he said.</p>
<p>As a result of the swine flu scare, Mexican migrant workers about to depart for Canada are now being screened there for flu symptoms and asked to fill out a questionnaire.</p>
<p>Immediately after Monday's news conference, Heimann left for the Leamington area to confer with hospital officials there. He said he would be holding frequent news conferences as new information became available.</p>
<p>"It is difficult to say how this outbreak will proceed," Heimann said.</p>
<p>Local doctors have received alerts about the swine flu. The health unit is monitoring local hospitals, nursing homes and long-term-care facilities.</p>
<p>The elderly and infirm are more at risk from the flu. "We're monitoring all our long-term-care facilities carefully," Heimann said.</p>
<p>Heimann advised Windsor and Essex County residents against travelling to Mexico if they could avoid it. "I certainly wouldn't be comfortable with a family member travelling to Mexico right now."</p>
<p>Heimann said travelling to the U.S. was not a concern.</p>
<p>The areas of Mexico with the most cases of swine flu include Mexico City and San Luis Potosi.</p>
<p>As of Monday, about 1,900 cases of swine flu were reported in Mexico with 149 deaths from what medical authorities there called a "grave pneumonia."</p>
<p>Heimann said only six cases of swine flu have been confirmed in Canada -- four students at a school in Nova Scotia who had travelled to Mexico and two cases in British Columbia.</p>
<p>By early Monday, U.S. health officials had confirmed 20 cases -- in New York City, California, Kansas, Texas and Ohio, Heimann said. Later Monday, the count was up to 40 confirmed U.S. cases and one suspected case in Livingston County, Mich.</p>
<p>Heimann stressed all the swine flu cases in Canada and the U.S. to date were mild infections with no hospitalization required.</p>
<p>Heimann said medical officials are very concerned about the Mexico flu outbreak because of the high number of fatalities and that many were young adults not normally at risk of dying from flu exposure. "That is certainly unusual," he said.</p>
<p>However, even more common flu strains can kill 500 to 1,500 people across Canada each year, Heimann said. So far, no serious respiratory illnesses have been reported recently in Windsor and Essex County, he said.</p>
<p>FLU SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT</p>
<p>Symptoms of Mexican swine flu are similar to those of any flu -- fever, coughing, sore throat, muscle and joint pain and shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Anyone with those symptoms who has travelled to Mexico recently should call their doctor first or call a hospital emergency room before coming in for treatment, says the local health unit. Symptoms may take up to seven days to show up after infection.</p>
<p>A vaccine for the Mexican swine flu has not yet been developed, but several drugs are effective in its treatment.</p>
<p>The usual precautions for flu season are also recommended: Frequent handwashing, coughing into tissues that are promptly disposed of, minimizing contact with others if you have symptoms and not visiting hospitals or nursing homes.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pandemic fears may complicate stock markets, tourism sector; 'The Last Straw'</b>
</div><div>Alia McMullen   </div>
<div>National Post; With files from David Akin, Canwest News Service and The Daily Telegraph</div>
<div>626 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Growing fear of a flu pandemic could delay an economic and stock market recovery and deal an even harder blow to Canada's tourism and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>"It's another complication we don't need in our tough economic situation," said Douglas Porter, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. "It might just be that last straw for some people that causes them to cancel vacation plans or stay home."</p>
<p>While the United States updated its travel alert on Mexico, the European Union issued travel warnings against the United States, and India and Malaysia issued travel warnings against Canada, stock markets lost ground as investors attempted to gauge the degree of threat from the swine virus.</p>
<p>At the height of the SARS epidemic in 2003, Hong Kong's Mandarin Oriental Hotel was reduced to a single paying guest. <span class="companylink">Cathay Pacific Airways</span> had to cut 42% of its flights in Asia.</p>
<p>This was although few people actually caught the disease. Just 813 died worldwide, fewer than deaths from normal flu every day. Yet the human reaction-- some say panic, others wise evasion-- was enough to bring the Pacific Rim to its knees for months. Estimated losses were US$30-billion.</p>
<p>Shares of any business connected to travel were battered. <span class="companylink">Continental Airlines</span> was among the worst hit, with its stock falling about 17%.</p>
<p>Fears of contracting a human-transmitted form of an animal virus could have psychological impacts that reach further than tourism by denting food production and trade.</p>
<p>Hog and pork-belly futures fell yesterday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as demand for pork products was expected to drop, even though experts say swine flu cannot be contracted by eating pork.</p>
<p>"Everyone gets worried about the origin of products --are they safe? Do they need to be tested? It adds another blockage to the system," said Peter Hall, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Export Development Canada</span>. "Anything like this could be very disruptive to the way global trade is organized right now."</p>
<p>The wave of fear was a boon for health care companies such as Noveko International, which makes air filters and face masks, and signed a deal to provide such equipment to Mexico in December.</p>
<p>In Europe, stocks rose for a second day, led by drugmakers as speculation a swine flu outbreak would boost sales of flu treatments overshadowed declines by travel companies.</p>
<p>But economists and market-watchers also cautioned that, although the World Health Organization raised its threat level yesterday from three to four on a scale of six, there is no indication yet a pandemic is imminent.</p>
<p>For economists, a pandemic exists when 15% to 35% of a given population is ill, forcing a massive loss of productivity as employees are simply too sick to work.</p>
<p>"There's no evidence that this will be pandemic but if it were, what that does, it shuts down national borders, it reduces the flow of goods and services between countries, and it leads therefore to significant supply shortages because no single country is self-reliant," said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p>"I think Canada is very well prepared. At this stage, there's no macroeconomic response required. I do know that the hospitals around the country are using their pandemic preparedness plans right now to make sure that, in the event that this were to spread, they are ready."</p>
<p>In a report last year, the World Bank estimated a global pandemic in which 1% of the world's population died, or 70 million people, could slash US$3-trillion (4.8%) from world GDP.</p>

<p>Canadian stocks were hit hard yesterday, as mounting fears of a major swine flu outbreak placed new doubts on an already-fragile global economy.</p>
<p>The S&P/TSX composite index lost 154.68 points or 1.6% to 9394.80, as losers outpaced gainers more than three-to-one and eight subindices ended the day in negative territory. It was the first losing session for Canada's main exchange since last Monday when it fell more than 300 points. The TSX venture exchange also snapped a winning streak losing 3.83 points or 0.4% to 1002.98. Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar was down 67 basis points to US82¢.</p>
<p>"Increased public awareness over the possibility of a major swine flu pandemic appears to have raised a number of concerns among investors," said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets Canada.</p>
<p>"Trading [yesterday] seems to suggest that fears have increased that a major flu epidemic may keep people at home and impact business and leisure travel demand, consumer spending, and demand for pork products. On the other hand, it also appears that a pandemic may increase demand for vaccines and medical diagnostic tools."</p>
<p>In Toronto, the air travel group was hit particularly hard, with <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. (WSJ/TSX) and Air Canada( AC/ TSX), both down more than 5% and tour operator, <span class="companylink">Transat A. T</span>. (TRZb/TSX), down more than 10%.</p>

</p>
<p>Airline stocks went into a free fall yesterday on fears that a global outbreak of swine flu could prove as detrimental to the industry as SARS did in 2003.</p>
<p>While it's still too early assess the impact of the latest outbreak, the AMEX Airline index fell 10.6% yesterday after the virus continued to spread from its epicentre in Mexico to locations around the world, including Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>Andrew Busch, BMO Nesbitt Burns global foreign exchange strategist, has studied the effect of such epidemics, and notes that travel, leisure, and retail sectors are typically the hardest hit.</p>
<p>"I do think travel to the originally infected areas will be severely curtailed," he said in a note yesterday. "Mexico's tourism will be severely negatively impacted."</p>
<p>Certainly that was the case with SARS. Asian-Pacific airlines lost an estimated US$6-billion in sales in 2003 after demand fell by 50% in the months following the outbreak, according to International Air Transport Association figures. However, as SARS spread, so did its economic impact.</p>
<p>Air Canada, whose hub in Toronto became a hot spot for the disease, was hit disproportionately hard. The resulting drop in demand during its peak summer season became a tipping point for it filing for bankruptcy that year.</p>
<p>While <span class="companylink">Transat A. T. Inc</span>. (TRZb/TSX), <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. (WJA/TSX), and <span class="companylink">Jazz Air Income Fund</span> (JAZun/TSX) all fell on the news yesterday, shares in Air Canada (AC/TSX) remained largely unaffected.</p>
<p>Cameron Doerksen, Versant Partners analyst, noted that Air Canada shares have already fallen more than 60% since mid-February when concerns were raised about its mounting debt and pension obligations during the downturn. "They've got other issues which are probably more serious than a flu epidemic," he said.</p>
<p>At this point, however, he said he doesn't expect the swine flu to have same impact on Canadian carriers SARS did.</p>
<p>So far, the Canadian cases have been isolated in British Columbia and Nova Scotia, and carriers here are also in the midst of moving much of their capacity out of the Mexican market with their winter schedules set to expire at the end of the week, he noted.</p>
<p>"If we had an outbreak of flu in February or March, I think it would be a lot more significant," Mr. Doerksen said.</p>
<p>Moreover, because such epidemics are typified by a sharp drop in demand and an equally quick recovery, there might be some buying opportunities created in the resulting sell off, according to Michael Linenberg, Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. analyst.</p>
<p>"The negative headlines could likely create a more attractive entry-point down the road for many of the names," he said in a note to clients. "However, a materially worsening of the situation could mean that we have to revisit our near-term investment stance."</p>
<p>He has a "buy" rating on <span class="companylink">AMR Corp</span>., Continental, <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span>, and <span class="companylink">UAL Corp</span>., and a 'neutral' rating on Air Canada and WestJet.</p>

<p>After more than a week at home, wheezing and coughing with flu-like symptoms, West Vancouver mom-to-be Anne Gavin is on pins and needles this morning.</p>
<p>That's when North Shore health officials are supposed to confirm whether she has the swine flu.</p>
<p>"I definitely fear that I do," Gavin, 43, who is five months pregnant, told The Province. "I am anxious to find out one way or the other. I want to know. It's a long wait."</p>
<p>Gavin and her husband, Ian Gavin, 46, returned from Mexico April 18 after their honeymoon in the southern Baja.</p>
<p>Within 36 hours, she was diagnosed with pneumonia and was treated in the emergency department of Lion's Gate Hospital.</p>
<p>"It's just strange," she said. "Within 36 hours of getting home, I am sick. And the next day they tell me I had pneumonia.</p>
<p>"I am still wheezing and coughing a lot," said Anne, who is on antibiotics.</p>
<p>She is isolated from her teenage son and her father and was also asked not to attend her maternity clinic this morning for a scheduled appointment, because of the risks to other moms and babies.</p>
<p>"We are expecting to hear definitely, one way or the other, whether she has the swine flu," said her husband.</p>
<p>He said he was sneezing uncontrollably on the flight back to Vancouver, where a fellow passenger was coughing throughout the flight.</p>
<p>But he's not too impressed with the way health officials are handling the situation. "They don't want to induce any kind of panic," he said. "So they are trying to play it as low-key as possible."</p>

</p>
<p>Swine flu has hit B.C.</p>
<p>Two Metro Vancouver men are suffering from a milder form of the potentially deadly flu strain that has already led to about 80 deaths in Mexico.</p>
<p>More cases are expected.</p>
<p>B.C. health officials confirmed the men, aged between 25 and 35, contracted a form of swine flu while visiting Mexico.</p>
<p>The same, milder strain of type A, H1N1 swine flu has infected about 20 people in the U.S. and suspected infections have cropped up as far afield as Europe, Israel and New Zealand.</p>
<p>"We've confirmed some cases of swine influenza in B.C.," Dr. Danuta Skowronski, flu expert at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, said yesterday.</p>
<p>"We would expect there to be more cases."</p>
<p>The B.C. men are being monitored. They are recovering at home, without being hospitalized.</p>
<p>"They were asked to self-isolate," said Skowronski. "This is not scary monsters. We had a surveillance system on high alert to be able to detect these cases, and we have."</p>
<p>Health officials are conducting follow-ups with those who came into contact with the men, including passengers on their airline flight.</p>
<p>There have also been four cases of swine flu in Nova Scotia, bringing the number of cases in Canada to six. The four, all students at a Windsor private school, recently visited Mexico. All are recovering and none was hospitalized.</p>
<p>The students' headmaster said 17 students and four staff were being isolated for seven days as a precaution.</p>
<p>"At this point, we are not seeing severe cases like we are in Mexico," said Nova Scotia's chief public health officer, Dr. Robert Strang.</p>
<p>"One of the challenges with this illness is that it has been so mild that many of the students can't really tell how sick they are," said local health officer Dr. Gaynor Watson-Creed.</p>
<p>Skowronski said Vancouver International Airport is being monitored for people with more severe symptoms.</p>
<p>People returning from Mexico with a fever and coughing, she said, should phone their doctor and stay home.</p>
<p>Doctors aren't sure why the illness has been so deadly in Mexico and mild in other countries.</p>
<p>New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg confirmed yesterday that eight schoolchildren there had contracted a mild form of the virus. Another 12 cases have been confirmed in California, Kansas, Ohio and Texas.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, 10 students from a school party that had been in Mexico were being tested after showing flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has declared the flu, of a type never seen before, a "public-health emergency of international concern" and says it could become a pandemic, or a global outbreak of serious disease.</p>
<p>Premier Gordon Campbell said public-health officials continue to stay on top of the potential outbreak.</p>
<p>"We're ready for this and we're going to keep on watching," Campbell told reporters in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Deputy provincial health officer, Dr. Eric Young, said more tests are being done on the B.C. patient specimens at the national microbiology lab in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>He said B.C. is working with the Public Health Agency of Canada, as well as officials in the U.S. and Mexico, to monitor the situation.</p>
<p>Health officials have issued a health notice for people travelling to Mexico, but no ban. Travellers should frequently wash their hands, cover up coughs and sneezes, and stay home if ill.</p>
<p>Anyone can call HealthLink B.C. at 8-1-1, around the clock.</p>

<p>What is swine flu?</p>
<p>Swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by the type A influenza virus. Symptoms can be similar to those of human influenza, including fever, cough, headache, aches and fatigue. Some people have reported runny noses, sore throats, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>

<p>Seventeen students and four teachers at a private Nova Scotia boarding school that recently sent a music class to Mexico are in medical isolation today after four of them tested positive for the same strain of swine flu that threatens to launch a global pandemic.</p>
<p>All are "recovering nicely" from minor respiratory ailments, and reluctant to sit out a week of school at the end of term, said Joseph Seagram, headmaster of the King's-Edgehill School in Windsor, N. S. "They're like, 'But I feel fine.' "</p>
<p>Two more separate cases of swine flu were confirmed yesterday in British Columbia. Both people had returned from Mexico with a mild respiratory ailment and sought medical help due to the publicity of the growing outbreak.</p>
<p>"These are Canada's first confirmed cases, but as we continue to ramp up our surveillance efforts, these cases are likely not the last we'll see," said federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>"We would be concerned if we weren't getting reports," said Danuta Skowronski, physician epidemiologist with the BC Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>The Nova Scotia students and teachers, only one of whom was on the Mexico trip to the southern state of Campeche, are to be isolated for seven days from the onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>"They are allowed to be with students who are sick, so they are not completely alone," Mr. Seagram said.</p>
<p>He said the illnesses were so mild that it took several days for anyone to report it.</p>
<p>Mr. Seagram said that when public health officials made further inquiries, they discovered cases of "allergies" or "sniffles" dating to just after the trip returned on April 8.</p>
<p>"For those who are sick, to be told you can't go to school for a week, that's really unwelcome news," Mr. Seagram said.</p>
<p>"If there wasn't the Mexican backdrop to this, our students would be wondering what the big deal was."</p>
<p>A blog kept by students describes their public performances at a Mexican school and for an Easter Week festival. It also mentions they travelled through Cancun, and that one student's mother and aunt travelled from Mexico City to join them.</p>
<p>Robert Strang, the province's medical officer of health, said the virus was "acquired in Mexico, brought home and spread," although precisely how is likely to remain a mystery.</p>
<p>"We're all assuming that the trip is the vector," Mr. Seagram said. "There's never been a definitive statement that this is exactly how the virus came into the school."</p>
<p>David Butler-Jones, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, said it is "naturally worrying" to see the first cases, but that Canada expected them, and is prepared for more.</p>
<p>"The SARS outbreak in 2003 changed how we approach these things," he said. "We have plans in place, and we are following them."</p>
<p>He contrasted swine flu to SARS, "a disease with dramatic effects and huge impacts," on account of the longer incubation period that made SARS so difficult to track and prevent.</p>
<p>Dr. Butler-Jones described the U. S. declaration of a state of emergency as a procedural formality, and said that while Canada did not follow suit, Canadian border agents are trained in medical surveillance, have immediate access to expert advice, and have already referred a few cases for further investigation.</p>
<p>Frank Plummer, scientific director of the National Micro-biology Laboratory, said the Winnipeg lab has done testing for Mexico, in addition to confirming the Canadian cases. His staff scientists are now turning their efforts to devising a vaccine in the way they make a new flu shot each year, and also testing whether the current flu vaccine offers any protection.</p>
<p>Air Canada and Westjet meanwhile announced they were waiving change fees for passengers to and from Mexico booked until April 30.</p>
<p>There is no government travel advisory for Mexico, where the outbreak began and has caused more than 80 deaths, but Dr. Skowronski urged people to "at least stay in touch with public health advisories."</p>
<p>She said officials in B. C. were only looking for hospitalized cases, and still discovered two mild ones.</p>
<p>"This indicates that yes, swine influenza is present in Canada. That's not unexpected. We had our surveillance system on high alert," she said.</p>

</div><div>Helen Popper And Alistair Bell   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>865 words</div><div>27 April 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Fears of a global swine flu pandemic grew with new infections in the United States and Canada yesterday, and millions of Mexicans hid indoors to avoid a virus that has already killed up to 103 people.</p>
<p>While the only deaths have been in Mexico, the flu is spreading, with 20 cases in the United States and six in Canada, and possible cases as far afield as Europe, Israel and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Offering a glimmer of hope in Mexico, President Felipe Calderon said most of the roughly 1,600 people in the country suspected of having the flu have been given a clean bill of health.</p>
<p>The United States declared a public health emergency and a top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said she feared there would be deaths in the United States as the new strain of flu spreads.</p>
<p>The normally bustling streets of Mexico City, one of the world's biggest cities, were all but empty yesterday, with millions preferring to stay at home rather than risk catching swine flu.</p>
<p>Many of those who did venture outside wore the blue face masks being handed out by soldiers at checkpoints along the main avenues. "This is the first time I've left the house in two days. I had to get some air," said Juan Casiano, a 39-year-old office worker, walking briskly through a city park.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic faithful listened to Mass on the radio rather than go to church, professional soccer games were played in empty stadiums and weekend cyclists stayed off the road in the city of 20 million people.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu a "public health emergency of international concern" that could become a pandemic, or global outbreak of serious disease. Deaths are now feared in the United States, a CDC official said.</p>
<p>Primer on swine flu, A10</p>
<p>"I do fear that we will have deaths," the agency's Dr. Anne Schuchat said. She told reporters that officials were preparing for the illness's possible spread beyond the 20 cases confirmed in the United States.</p>
<p>New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg confirmed yesterday that eight schoolchildren there had contracted the virus, although the cases were mild and it did not appear to be spreading rapidly to the general population. Some of the students at the school had reportedly been in Mexico on Spring Break.</p>
<p>Another 12 cases have been confirmed in California, Kansas, Ohio and Texas.</p>
<p>Officials said they would release a quarter of the U. S. stockpile of the antiviral drugs Tamiflu, made by <span class="companylink">Roche AG</span>, and Relenza, from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>. Both have been shown to be effective against the new swine flu.</p>
<p>Flu is characterized by a sudden fever, muscle aches, sore throat and dry cough. Victims of the new strain have also suffered more vomiting and diarrhea than is usual with flu. People who are infected can spread the virus before they even start showing symptoms.</p>
<p>Although it is called "swine flu" there is no evidence that any of the cases stemmed from contact with pigs.</p>
<p>Health officials say they do not understand why deaths have been reported in Mexico but nowhere else. "I think right now it is really premature to say the disease is different in Mexico from here," Dr. Schuchat said.</p>
<p>A 1968 "Hong Kong" flu pandemic killed about one million people globally.</p>
<p>Authorities across Asia, who have had to grapple with deadly viruses such as H5N1 bird flu and SARS in recent years, snapped into action. At airports and other border checkpoints in Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, officials screened travellers for any flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Spain screened all passengers arriving off flights from Mexico yesterday and tested eight suspected cases of swine fever.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, 10 students from a school party that had been in Mexico were being tested after showing flu-like symptoms and two patients in Scotland were also under observation after their return from Mexico. A 30-year-old man was isolated at a medical centre in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on suspicion he is suffering from a swine flu strain.</p>
<p>A pandemic would deal a major blow to a world economy already suffering its worst crisis in decades, and experts say it could cost trillions of dollars.</p>
<p>In the United States, the Obama administration said it would be premature to talk about the potential impact of a new flu outbreak on a hoped-for economic recovery in the United States and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>"In terms of anything that is affected economically, both here and worldwide, it is probably far too early to determine whether that will be a case or whether that will have some factor," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters yesterday.</p>

</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>It's a respiratory disease pigs get caused by type A influenza viruses. Humans are rarely infected.</p>
<p>How do you get it?</p>
<p>Through contact with an infected person or pig. It's unknown how easily it spreads person-to-person, but it's mainly through coughing and sneezing. People can also touch something with the virus on it and then touch their noses or mouths. You cannot get it from eating pork. It's not spread through food. It's transmitted through close contact with infected pigs or their environments such as barns or fairs.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms?</p>
<p>It's similar to influenza and includes fever, chills, cough, sore throat, body ache, headache, fatigue, lethargy and lack of appetite. Sometimes it also causes diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and a runny nose.</p>
<p>Who is at risk?</p>
<p>Reports suggest it is infecting previously healthy young adults. That is unusual compared to normal human flu which puts the elderly and very young children at highest risk.</p>
<p>Can you treat it?</p>
<p>Swine flu ranges from mild illness to severe and even deadly. Prescription antiviral drugs are used to treat it, particularly oseltamivir, more commonly known as Tamiflu, or zanamivir, also known as Relenza. It's best to start taking these within two days of getting symptoms.</p>
<p>Is there a vaccine?</p>
<p>There is no vaccine for humans, only pigs. The seasonal flu shot is believed to provide at least some protection.</p>
<p>How long can an infected person spread it?</p>
<p>Adults are contagious for up to seven days after the onset of illness and for the entire time they have symptoms. Children can be contagious for 10 days or longer.</p>
<p>How is it prevented?</p>
<p>The best protection is washing your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand cleaners. Keep about one metre away from people and avoid close contact with anyone who is sick. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Live healthy by getting plenty of sleep and exercise. Avoid stress. Drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritiously. If you are sick, cover your cough and stay home.</p>
<p>When should you go to the doctor?</p>
<p>Seek medical attention if you have visited Mexico, California or Texas in the last two weeks and are having any respiratory symptoms.</p>

<p>Work on a new vaccine to guard against human swine flu is underway at a Winnipeg lab as health officials across the continent move to contain the growing threat that could spark a worldwide influenza outbreak.</p>
<p>With the mysterious disease that initially cropped up in Mexico spreading to Canada, teams of scientists from the Winnipeg-based National Microbiology Lab have started work on a vaccine to protect against H1N1 swine flu and are investigating whether the existing flu shot could offer any protection from the virus.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Plummer, the lab's scientific director, said scientists will test to see if the flu shot will protect animals from swine flu since the annual shot already contains H1N1 human flu virus.</p>
<p>Plummer said there are still many unknowns about human swine flu, but said genetics or environmental factors could help to explain why Mexico seems to be experiencing a more severe form of swine flu than seen in Canada and the U. S.</p>
<p>Winnipeg's lab has done most of the testing of swine flu samples from Mexico.</p>
<p>Plummer said he's had a good working relationship with Mexican health officials through the Canadian-led Global Health Security Action Group, which is why Mexican authorities approached the Winnipeg lab for help diagnosing samples on April 17.</p>
<p>Plummer said Friday it would take scientists at least six months to develop a vaccine.</p>

</p>
<p>Canada is likely to see more cases of the swine flu that has killed dozens in Mexico, but no one in Canada has become seriously ill.</p>
<p>So far, six cases have been confirmed in Canada, two in Metro Vancouver and the others in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>In Nova Scotia, health officials said two of the four victims, all students at the same private school, recently visited Mexico.</p>
<p>The Canadian cases "have thankfully been relatively mild and the patients are recovering," said Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, who warned, "as we continue to ramp up our surveillance efforts these cases are likely not the last we'll see in Canada."</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said health officials were "following plans and protocols prepared in advance for events like this."</p>
<p>David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said it is "troubling" for Canada to have its first confirmed cases. The symptoms in the Canadian cases are mild, he said, but people should practise good basic flu-prevention techniques to reduce risks of infection.</p>
<p>"At this point, we are not seeing severe cases like we are in Mexico," said Dr. Robert Strang, chief public health officer for Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Joe Seagram, headmaster of the Windsor, N.S. private school where the cases were confirmed, said 21 people -- 17 students and four staff -- are in isolation for seven days as a precaution. In all, 28 people took part in the trip to Mexico.</p>
<p>"All those who had the flu are recovering either at home or in the dormitory," said Strang.</p>
<p>Dr. Gaynor Watson-Creed, medical officer of health for the Capital District Health Authority in Nova Scotia, said health officials are closely monitoring the other students at the school.</p>
<p>"One of the challenges with this illness is that it has been so mild that many of the students can't really tell how sick they are," she said, adding that most of the children just had a cough and fatigue. There may be many more children who had the virus and didn't report it because they felt fine, she said.</p>
<p>While some people at the school were wearing face masks over the weekend, Strang said protective covering had not been recommended by health authorities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Air Canada and WestJet announced they were waiving change fees for passengers to and from Mexico booked until Thursday.</p>
<p>The new flu strain, a mixture of various swine, bird and human viruses, poses the biggest risk of a large-scale pandemic since avian flu surfaced in 1997, when several hundred died.</p>
<p>New flu strains can spread quickly because no one has natural immunity to them and vaccine takes months to develop.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Two cases of swine flu found in B.C.; CDC urges recent travellers to Mexico to 'self-isolate' if suffering from influenza-like symptoms</b>
</div><div>Denise Ryan   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>807 words</div><div>27 April 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Two people in Metro Vancouver have the same swine flu virus that has killed dozens in Mexico, according to local health authorities.</p>
<p>"None of the cases of influenza have been hospitalized," said Dr. Danuta Skowronski of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>She said both of those affected had experienced mild respiratory symptoms, both were young adults and both had recently travelled to Mexico. Skowronski declined to identify what area in Mexico the young people had travelled to.</p>
<p>Because both cases were mild, Skowronski said the patients had not required treatment with Tamiflu or other anti-viral medications.</p>
<p>Swabs processed at the Centre for Disease Control's provincial laboratory identified the influenza strain as the same type A, H1N1 swine flu virus that has appeared in California and Mexico.</p>
<p>B.C.'s two cases brings the total of confirmed cases in Canada to six, including four in Nova Scotia, all of whom presented only mild symptoms and were not hospitalized.</p>
<p>The CDC said Sunday it expects more cases to be diagnosed.</p>
<p>The B.C. cases were detected thanks to "intense surveillance" by health care workers responding to a high alert from the CDC, said Skowronski.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. Department of Health has confirmed 20 cases and declared a public emergency, and Mexico has reported up to 81 deaths and more than 800 cases, Skowronski urged the public not to panic.</p>
<p>"This influenza virus does not automatically mean hospitalization and death. This is not necessarily scary monsters," she said.</p>
<p>Skowronski recommended anyone who has travelled to Mexico and comes down with an influenza-like virus to "self-isolate."</p>
<p>"People with fever and cough, do us all a favour and stay at home. If you are feeling worse, see your doctor."</p>
<p>Skowronski said those who have travelled to Mexico and have flu-like symptoms should let their doctor's office know in advance so those in the office can take measures to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Health care workers have been provided with detailed advice on how to manage suspect or confirmed cases, the CDC said.</p>
<p>If a patient who had travelled to an affected region came in with a mild or severe respiratory illness, the family doctor would take safeguards similar to those for a seasonal flu, said the CDC's Roy Wadia.</p>
<p>That would include gloves and possibly masks. Doctors would notify the health authority and make sure specimens are sent to the appropriate labs.</p>
<p>Skowronski said: "With just six cases so far across Canada, that's still a small number. We know how it's spread, we know how to minimize it."</p>
<p>The Centre for Disease Control recommends covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you sneeze or cough, and disposing of it afterward. It also recommends frequent hand-washing, and avoiding close contact with sick people.</p>
<p>No travel advisories have been issued as yet, but the Public Health Agency of Canada is working with the World Health Organization and other agencies to monitor the outbreak. Travel notices will be updated accordingly.</p>
<p>"Quarantine officials at airports across Canada have been notified to be alert for symptoms of respiratory illness among travellers from Mexico," said Skowronski.</p>
<p>Quarantine officials are not screening individual travellers due to the volume of passengers who enter Canada from Mexico each day, nor are they reporting individuals to the CDC.</p>
<p>Skowronski said there is no pandemic alert at this time. "Pandemic alerts are about severe, not mild illnesses," said Skowronski.</p>
<p>Teams from Canada are in Mexico, she said, working closely with world health authorities to track the spread of the influenza and determine its potential severity.</p>
<p>Minister of Health Leona Aglukkaq and chief public health officer Dr. David Butler- Jones also spoke out to ease fears Sunday, saying the federal government is working closely with the provinces and territories and international partners to protect the health and safety of Canadians.</p>

<p>FLU PREVENTION</p>
<p>Precautions</p>
<p>- Cover nose and mouth when you sneeze.</p>
<p>- Dispose of tissues in trash.</p>
<p>- Wash hands frequently with soap and water. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.</p>
<p>- Avoid close contact with sick people.</p>
<p>- If you get sick, stay home.</p>
<p>- Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Germs spread that way.</p>
<p>- Germs can rest on hard surfaces like counters and doorknobs.</p>
<p>- Swine flu is not a food safety concern.</p>
<p>- Proper cooking of pork products would kill any viruses. Additionally, swine exhibiting symptoms of influenza would not pass tests to enter into the food market.</p>

</p>
<p>Canadian health officials reported six "mild" cases of swine flu on Sunday -- the first confirmed cases in Canada since an outbreak of the illness began in Mexico several days ago -- and warned there could be more cases in the days ahead.</p>
<p>As governments around the world rushed on Sunday to check the spread of a new type of swine flu that has killed as many as 81 people in Mexico and has infected about 20 people in the U.S., Nova Scotia health officials said two of the four victims in that province, all students at the same private school, recently visited Mexico. Two cases also were confirmed in British Columbia. None of the people in Canada has been hospitalized.</p>
<p>The Canadian cases "have thankfully been relatively mild and the patients are recovering," said Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, who warned "as we continue to ramp up our surveillance efforts these cases are likely not the last we'll see in Canada."</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said health officials were "following plans and protocols prepared in advance for events like this."</p>
<p>The minister said that the government was co-ordinating its response in key departments and that, in addition to consulting with provincial and territorial counterparts, she had been in contact with officials in the U.S. and at the World Health Organization. Aglukkaq said the prime minister was being regularly briefed on the situation.</p>
<p>"To have our first confirmed cases is, of course, troubling," said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, adding that while the symptoms in Canada were "mild," Canadians had to practise good basic flu-prevention techniques to lower risks of infection.</p>
<p>Because the outbreak is at an early stage "there's a lot more unknowns than is known" said Frank Plummer of the Public Health Agency of Canada. "We'll learn a lot more as we do further epidemiological analysis and research."</p>
<p>Health officials said Washington's decisions to declare a public health emergency did not suggest people were in greater danger, but that the declaration was part of a normal course of action to facilitate state and federal response.</p>
<p>"At this point, we are not seeing severe cases like we are in Mexico," said Dr. Robert Strang, chief public health officer for Nova Scotia, where four cases were confirmed.</p>
<p>Joe Seagram, the headmaster of the private school in Windsor, N.S., said 21 people were in isolation, 17 students and four staff. They are being isolated for seven days as a precaution.</p>
<p>"All those who had the flu are recovering either at home or in the dormitory," said Strang.</p>
<p>Dr. Gaynor Watson-Creed, medical officer of health for the Capital District Health Authority in Nova Scotia, said health officials are closely monitoring the other students at the school.</p>
<p>"One of the challenges with this illness is that it has been so mild that many of the students can't really tell how sick they are," she said, adding that most of the children just had a cough and fatigue. There may be many more children who had the virus and didn't report they were sick because they felt fine, she said.</p>
<p>While some people at the school were wearing face masks over the weekend, Strang said wearing protective covering had not been recommended by health authorities.</p>
<p>Dr. Danuta Skowronski, a spokeswoman for the BC Centre for Disease Control, said the two people with mild cases of swine flu were in the greater Vancouver area and had recently travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>"This is not scary monsters," she said at a news conference in Vancouver. "We had a surveillance system on high alert to be able to detect these cases and we have."</p>
<p>Doctors aren't sure why the illness has been so deadly in Mexico and mild in other countries, said Skowronski.</p>
<p>"The six confirmed cases in Canada are different from what we are seeing in Mexico," she said. "We do expect more cases."</p>
<p>Officials in Ontario and Quebec said there were no cases of the swine flu in their provinces, but had people are under observation for the respiratory virus.</p>
<p>Air Canada and Westjet, meanwhile, announced they were waiving change fees for passengers to and from Mexico booked until April 30.</p>
<p>While all the deaths so far have been in Mexico, the flu is spreading in the United States, and possible infections popped up as far afield as Europe and New Zealand.</p>
<p>About two-thirds of the 1,300 people in Mexico who were suspected of having swine flu were given a clean bill of health and sent home from hospital, according to Mexican President Felipe Calderon.</p>
<p>Officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday that they expected fatalities from swine flu in the United States.</p>
<p>However, the CDC's acting director, Dr. Richard Besser, told a White House briefing that "if you do not have symptoms you should not get tested" by a doctor.</p>
<p>New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg confirmed on Sunday that eight schoolchildren there had contracted the virus, although the cases were mild and it did not appear to be spreading rapidly to the general population. Another 12 cases have been confirmed in California, Kansas, Ohio and Texas.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has declared the flu, of a type never seen before, a "public health emergency of international concern" and says it could become a pandemic, or a global outbreak of serious disease.</p>
<p>A 1968 "Hong Kong" flu pandemic killed about one million people globally.</p>
<p>The new flu strain, a mixture of various swine, bird and human viruses, poses the biggest risk of a large-scale pandemic since avian flu surfaced in 1997, killing several hundred people.</p>
<p>WHO director general Dr. Margaret Chan urged greater worldwide surveillance for any unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness.</p>
<p>Although it is called "swine flu" there is no evidence that any of the cases stemmed from contact with pigs, said Liz Wagstrom, a veterinarian who works on public health issues for the U.S. National Pork Board.</p>
<p>New flu strains can spread quickly because no one has natural immunity to them and a vaccine takes months to develop.</p>
<p>Authorities across Asia, who have had to grapple with deadly viruses, such as H5N1 bird flu and SARS in recent years, snapped into action. At airports and other border checkpoints in Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, officials screened travellers for any flu-like symptoms.</p>

<p>TORONTO --</p>
<p>The World Health Organization moved its emergency committee meeting up to today with the expectation that the pandemic alert level will be raised as officials began investigating more cases of a new strain of swine flu.</p>
<p>The current level is 3 on a scale of 1 to 6. Level 3 indicates very limited human-to-human transmission of a new virus. Level 4 is evidence of community-wide outbreaks, while level 5 indicates significant human-to-human transmission. Level 6 is a pandemic.</p>
<p>“We have seen the disease spread geographically, and because of this spread and because of the increasing number of cases, the second meeting of the emergency committee, which we had originally expected to convene tomorrow, has been brought forward to today,” WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl told reporters in a conference call from Geneva.</p>
<p>The virus was suspected in up to 103 deaths in Mexico, with more than 1,600 cases suspected.</p>
<p>It is confirmed in 40 cases in the United States, 26 in Mexico, six in Canada and one in Spain. Those affected in Canada, the U.S. and Spain suffered mild symptoms and have either recovered or are recovering.</p>
<p>The United States is issuing a travel advisory instructing Americans to avoid non-essential travel to Mexico. Canadian officials are expected to speak later today.</p>
<p>Mr. Hartl said he didn't want to prejudge what would happen at the emergency committee meeting.</p>
<p>“We don't know how much human to human transmission in communities there are in these other locations. It might still be the case that all these cases are imported cases,” Mr. Hartl said. “There will be judgments made because of that as to whether Phase 4 or Phase 5 is more appropriate.”</p>
<p>Given that the virus is spreading, Mr. Hartl indicated that containing it may not be feasible unless it's found that most of the cases come from a single area and that the cases in other countries are imported cases because of travel to that particular area.</p>
<p>The unusual influenza A H1N1 swine virus was first reported last week, when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced it had found cases with the virus.</p>
<p>There are two confirmed cases in British Columbia, and four in Nova Scotia. Furthermore, health officials are investigating 12 suspected cases in Ontario and two in Quebec.</p>
<p>Several countries have issued advisories or advice about travelling to Canada, Mexico and the United States because of swine flu. India's government has issued a travel advisory, telling its citizens to restrict visits to Canada, Mexico, the U.S. and New Zealand, where three people are suspected of having swine flu. The Times of India reports all travellers flying into India from Canada and other countries that have confirmed cases of swine flu will be individually checked for symptoms such as a fever and upper respiratory tract infection.</p>
<p>Media reports from Malaysia say that country's Health Ministry is advising Malaysians against travelling to Canada, Mexico and selected U.S. states where there are swine flu cases.</p>
<p>Australia's Foreign Affairs department makes note of the Canadian swine flu cases on its Web site, telling Australian travellers to Canada they should consult a doctor or go to a hospital if they develop flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>The European Union's health commissioner, Andorra Vassilio, urged Europeans to postpone non-essential travel to the United States or Mexico due to swine flu, but did not mention Canada.</p>
<p>Russia, Hong Kong and Taiwan said they would quarantine visitors showing symptoms of the virus amid a surging global concern about a possible pandemic.</p>
<p>A Canadian woman is undergoing tests at a hospital in Manchester to determine if she represents England's first case of swine flu. Loren Grant, a spokeswoman for the North West Area Health Authority, says it's going to take some time before the tests are confirmed.</p>
<p>Ms. Grant says she does not know whether the woman was recently in Mexico, and the health authority isn't releasing further details on her condition. A local newspaper says she was visiting family in England before being admitted to hospital in Manchester this morning. The paper quotes hospital officials as saying the woman seems “well” and is not displaying severe symptoms.</p>
<p>In Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said the threat of spreading swine flu infections is a cause for concern but “not a cause for alarm” as the United States undertook close border monitoring to contain it.</p>
<p>WHO investigators are tracking down the origins of the virus and are trying to figure out why cases in the U.S., Canada and Spain are milder than the some of the ones in Mexico. Mr. Hartl said a team in Mexico is looking into it, and will hopefully have some answers.</p>
<p>Richard Besser, acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said just because the cases aren't severe outside of Mexico, doesn't mean that won't change. “I wouldn't rest on the fact that we have only seen cases in this country [the U.S.] that are less severe. As we continue to look, I expect that we will see additional cases. I expect the spectrum of disease will expand,” he said in a conference call.</p>
<p>The new strain appears vulnerable to anti-viral drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza if it is caught in its early days. Canada has stockpiled 55 million doses of the anti-viral drug.</p>
<p>Health officials believe the rate of infection may decrease as summer comes, giving them time to find a vaccine or to do further research before the flu season kicks in again next fall. It is believed that the new swine influenza spreads the same way as the seasonal flu and has similar symptoms, including fever and joint aches.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Unknowns linger over swine flu; Health officials warn against complacency due to fears the disease could spread and become more severe</b>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Despite evidence that swine flu viruses are circulating in at least three countries, the World Health Organization said yesterday it needs more time to decide whether to raise the pandemic alert level.</p>
<p>Canada joined Mexico and the United States on the list of countries with confirmed cases, with Nova Scotia and British Columbia reporting a total of six cases. All have had mild disease and are recovering. There were reports as well that Spain and New Zealand have suspected cases.</p>
<p>Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the WHO's acting assistant director general for health security and environment, said the emergency committee that advises the WHO's director general on whether to raise the pandemic threat level or declare a pandemic will convene again tomorrow, unless new developments require an earlier meeting.</p>
<p>"We want to make sure we are on pretty good, solid ground,'' he said in a teleconference from Geneva.</p>
<p>The discordant disease pattern -- mild in the U.S. and Canada, more severe in Mexico -- is puzzling influenza experts and making it difficult to see what it truly going on. Adding to the confusion is the fact that genetic sequencing of viruses from the U.S. and Mexico show the same strain of the influenza A H1N1 swine flu is responsible for the illness.</p>
<p>Officials tried to prepare people for the idea that it is early days and the mild illness currently being seen in the U.S. and Canada is unlikely to be the whole picture.</p>
<p>"Just because we're having mild cases nobody should take this for granted in any way,'' Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said at a news conference yesterday.</p>
<p>"No one should lull themselves into thinking that everything's just fine because it's a relatively mild disease.''</p>
<p>International authorities as well suggested people should prepare themselves for continued spread of the virus, the possibility of school closures as the virus hits new communities and that deaths are likely to occur.</p>
<p>"Of course, we may be fortunate and not have them,'' said Dr. Anne Schuchat, interim deputy director for the science and public health program at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.</p>
<p>"But I think we really need to prepare for the idea that we will have additional cases . . . and I do fear we will have deaths here.''</p>
<p>The acting head of the CDC, Dr. Richard Besser, said people should start making plans for how they can cope when the virus reaches their communities, for instance how they would handle child-care arrangements if their children's schools were closed.</p>
<p>He suggested authorities are in discussions with vaccine manufacturers exploring the option of making a vaccine against the virus. Among the ideas being explored would be to add a fourth component to the existing flu shot, which is designed to protect against two subtypes of influenza A and one family of influenza B viruses.</p>
<p>Schuchat also revealed that testing being done at the CDC suggests seasonal flu shots probably don't offer protection against this virus.</p>
<p>Flu shots contain a component to protect against human H1N1 viruses. While swine viruses have the same name, they are genetically very different, experts say.</p>
<p>"The tests that we've done so far against the seasonal flu vaccine of H1N1 is very pessimistic. It does not look like there's cross-reacting antibodies from the seasonal vaccine . . . to this particular virus,'' said Schuchat.</p>
<p>She said work is ongoing to see whether having been infected with H1N1 flu viruses in the past would confer any immune protection against the swine flu viruses.</p>
<p>Fukuda, the WHO's acting assistant director general for health security and environment, said teams from the WHO, Canada and the CDC are in or are heading to Mexico to help public health authorities there try to figure out why the pattern of disease appears to be so different.</p>
<p>The United States has reported 20 cases, and Mexico's health authorities say the disease has killed up to 103 people in his country and likely sickened more than 1,600 since April 13.</p>
<p>It has been reported that in Mexico a large percentage of the cases are in people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, a demographic not generally hard hit by flu.</p>
<p>Officials haven't ruled out the possibility that some other viruses are causing some of the illness there, though there are no reports that they have found any other likely culprit.</p>
<p>Fukuda said people should understand that flu viruses change constantly and that the current behaviour of the virus is no guarantee of its future actions.</p>
<p>"It's quite possible for this virus to continue to evolve. So when viruses evolve, clearly they can become dangerous for people, that is to cause more serious disease,'' said Fukuda, whose specialty is influenza.</p>
<p>"Or they're also able to mutate so that they cause less serious disease. And that's very difficult to predict and it is one of the things we will watch for very carefully.''</p>
<p>He cautioned against predictions about how a pandemic with this virus might play out, if it goes on to become a pandemic strain.</p>
<p>"I think we are too early in our investigations to be able to address the lethality of the virus,'' Fukuda said.</p>
<p>"Clearly we are seeing reports of cases which are mild . . . and we are also hearing reports about cases in Mexico, although it's a little bit less clear how often these are associated with either fatal cases or serious illness cases.''</p>
<p>"I think it's way too early right now to predict whether we might see a mild pandemic or a severe pandemic.''</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Swine flu has entered Canada with a whimper but public-health authorities warn that a half-dozen mild cases reported in Nova Scotia and British Columbia could give way to a more serious outbreak.</p>
<p>All the Canadian illnesses are linked to Mexican travel, although the cases announced yesterday have been so innocuous that none of the patients in Nova Scotia or B.C. even required hospitalization.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean the bug will remain mild, federal authorities warned as they cast a wary glance at the scores of deaths in Mexico caused by the virus.</p>
<p>Federal officials said they have already begun discussions with drug companies about producing a new vaccine, amid fears that existing treatments would fail to resist the virus.</p>
<p>David Butler-Jones, the chief public health officer for the federal government, noted that the first patients may have had mild flu symptoms but he cautioned against complacency.</p>
<p>"It doesn't mean we won't see either more severe illness or, potentially, deaths,'' he said.</p>
<p>"There's many reasons to treat this seriously. No one should lull themselves into thinking that everything's just fine because it's a relatively mild disease.''</p>
<p>Canadian government scientists helped identify the virus. Their Mexican counterparts contacted them by e-mail with concerns on April 17 and they conducted tests at Winnipeg's national microbiology lab.</p>
<p>Fears of a pandemic quickly rippled across the globe. There were 20 cases reported in the U.S. in states ranging from California to New York; there were 10 suspected positive tests in New Zealand from students who recently went to Mexico; Russia even banned meat imports from Mexico, although health experts say it's unlikely the virus would be transmitted through food.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said she's been in touch with her provincial counterparts and has ordered the Public Health Agency of Canada to alert border authorities, quarantine officers and other officials.</p>
<p>Customs agents at airports are on the lookout for anyone with flu-like symptoms and have already pulled aside two arriving passengers and sent them to be examined.</p>
<p>Air Canada and WestJet both announced yesterday they would waive fees for anyone seeking to change their Mexican flight plans between now and April 30.</p>
<p>For the time being, however, Aglukkaq urged the general public to concentrate on "important but very simple precautions.''</p>
<p>They include the standard advice for people to wash their hands frequently, cover their mouths and noses when they cough or sneeze and stay home and avoid contact with others if they feel ill.</p>
<p>The minister also advised anyone who has recently visited Mexico and developed flu-like symptoms to see a doctor without delay.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, Dr. Danuta Skowronski, of B.C.'s Centre for Disease Control, told reporters that so far there is no sign in Canada of the severe respiratory illness that Mexico has been grappling with.</p>
<p>Skowronski said the two people on the B.C. Lower Mainland who have contracted the flu have been asked to "self-isolate'' but have not been quarantined.</p>
<p>Twenty-one people at a private school in rural Nova Scotia were placed in quarantine after a trip to Mexico, which included a cultural and music exchange in the southern Yucatan Peninsula.</p>
<p>Four teenagers at King's-Edgehill School were diagnosed as some of Canada's first swine-flu patients. The students reported fatigue, muscle aches and coughing, but nothing out of the ordinary for a flu sufferer.</p>
<p>Only one of those sick students had actually been to Mexico. The school placed the 17 children in its medical facility, while two teachers joined them there and two other teachers were forced to remain home.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia's chief public health officer said the four "very mild'' cases of swine flu were detected in students ranging in age from 12 to 17 or 18. All are recovering, he said.</p>
<p>"It was acquired in Mexico, brought home and spread,'' said Dr. Robert Strang.</p>
<p>Because swine flu is so new, most laboratories don't have tests to identify them, and they show up as untypeable influenza A when tests are run.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon told CTV the federal cabinet has set up an operations committee and has been monitoring the swine flu situation closely.</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs has posted information on its website on the health situation in Mexico but is not telling Canadians to stay away from the country.</p>
<p>More than one million Canadians travel to Mexico each year, and about 600,000 Mexicans visit Canada.</p>
<p>The federal government has a telephone hotline and websites for information about the virus.</p>
<p>The phone number is 1-800-454-8302, and the websites are www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca], www.voyage.ca[http://www.voyage.ca] and www.phac.gc.ca[http://www.phac.gc.ca].</p>

</p>
<p>Airline and tourism stocks have been hit by fears that the swine flu outbreak will force consumers to scale back travel plans.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines</span> Ltd.fell 5 per cent, tour operator <span class="companylink">Transat A.T</span>. Inc.tumbled 10 per cent and Air Canada's regional affiliate, <span class="companylink">Jazz Air Income Fund</span>, slid 5 on Monday morning.</p>
<p>The Canadian companies were part of a global trend that saw Asian and European airline and tourism shares decline on concerns about dampened travel amid the spread of swine flu.</p>
<p>On Sunday afternoon, Air Canadasaid it will waive change fees for passengers with reservations to and from Mexico City up to this Thursday, and WestJet followed suit Sunday night with its decision to not charge customers who change or cancel flights to and from Mexico until the end of April.</p>
<p>Versant Partners Inc. analyst Cameron Doerksen said some consumers will reconsider their trips to Mexico in the short term, but he noted that the peak winter travel season is over for holidays to sun destinations.</p>
<p>While it's too early to determine the impact on Canadian carriers, the epicentre of the swine flu outbreak is in Mexico and not at Air Canada's hub in Toronto, which got hit by the SARS outbreak in the spring of 2003, Mr. Doerksen said.</p>
<p>“Toronto was a SARS hotspot, but that's not the case with this swine flu outbreak,” he said.</p>
<p>Air Canada shares were flat on Monday morning at 80 cents, while the airline's parent company, <span class="companylink">ACE Aviation Holdings Inc</span>., recovered to post a small gain after its shares shed 5.5 per cent when the Toronto Stock Exchange opened.</p>
<p>“SARS was much worse on Air Canada than what we're seeing here,” Mr. Doerksen said.</p>

<p>Lewis Black</p>
<p>At the Winter Garden Theatre On Sunday in Toronto</p>
<p>A baseball announcer, to let his listeners know to expect a wild, wooly and offensive game, will say that the "wind is blowing out today" at such and such stadium.</p>
<p>The wind was blowing out at the Winter Garden Theatre on Sunday.</p>
<p>Lewis Black, a touchy U.S. humorist with all the serenity of Ralph Kramden, sputtered brilliantly on the third night of his three-show stand. The flabbergasted one questioned Toronto weather — fairly a default target for visiting comics — and railed against the alcohol warnings to pregnant women posted at restaurants here. He told a laughing crowd that he was not concerned that the departure of former president Bush would put him at a loss for material. "Do you think stupidity left the country?" he asked. "Leadership in my country is like whack-a-mole. You get rid of one idiot, and another three pop up."</p>
<p>The Maryland-raised ranter pronounced the pronoun "you" interestingly, as if the middle of the word was cinched — "yeww." He used his middle fingers often, always simultaneously and pointedly.</p>
<p>He grimaced, suffered, stuttered and dropped F-bombs heroically. He was for the legalization of marijuana, but against bran muffins.</p>
<p>Seemingly affected by a cold, Black reckoned that Canada was the "phlegm capital of the world," but was happy to be here for his Dual Citizenship Tour, given the swine-flu outbreak to the south.</p>
<p>The star, aged 60, was bothered by birthday celebrations and short-term memory loss, but reconciled his landmark age by viewing himself as "two 30-year-olds who spend the day describing my problems."</p>
<p>Black went on for about 100 minutes, strenuously. He vented his comical rage palpably, as if grasping nitwitted leaders by the throat with one hand, while throttling his audience into understanding his concerns with his other.</p>
<p>It was something to see, but he really needn't have tried so hard. He had us at "[Bleep] you!"</p>
<p>The Daily Show commentator was left speechless only twice: Once, when his audience blanched at the description of Bush junior as a "dry drunk" — "If you're going to vote for a person because you think you'd like to hang out with him, don't elect a dry drunk" — and a second time when the mention of his parents' 63rd wedding anniversary earned no applause. "You people are the most bitter group of people I've ever met," he sighed.</p>
<p>A long bit on having to follow the angelic couple of Vince Gill and Amy Grant ("God made her of cream") at a concert in St. Louis was gold.</p>
<p>In these depressed times, Black closed with a lengthy monologue on hope. "Obama's nipples are bursting with hope," the comic was heard to say, before turning genuine. "Nothing beats hope," said the momentarily lapsed curmudgeon. "It's the best drug — and I've tried them all."</p>
<p>The crusty-for-show comedian, who autographed copies of his books afterward, told us that when he was younger he wished for alternative energy, flying cars and nationalized health care, but that his "little basket of hopes and dreams" was pissed upon repeatedly. And so, his expectations are lower. All that he hopes for now is a bowl of whipped cream at his hotel door when he wakes up tomorrow morning. What does that mean? You'll have to see his act to understand. Just know that Lewis Black doesn't ask for too much — he really doesn't.</p>
<p>Lewis Black plays Winnipeg, April 29; Regina, April 30; Saskatoon, May 1; Victoria, May 5; Vancouver, May 8-9; Calgary, May 12; and Edmonton, May 13.</p>

</p>
<p>The White House says Barack Obama is "highly engaged" in monitoring the swine flu outbreak -- and well he might. For a while, the president's doctors feared he had come as close as anyone in the country to contracting the virus.</p>
<p>According to reports from Mexico City, Felipe Solis, a distinguished archeologist who showed Obama around the city's anthropology museum during his visit to Mexico this month, died the next day from "flu-like symptoms."</p>
<p>Solis met Obama at a gala dinner at the museum April 16, before travelling to the Americas summit in Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mexico's health minister said that Solis had died of pneumonia and that it was not thought he had swine flu.</p>
<p>The White House said the president's doctors had given him an all-clear. Obama showed no symptoms after the usual incubation period.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Despite evidence that swine flu viruses are circulating in at least three countries, the World Health Organization said yesterday it needs more time to decide whether to raise the pandemic alert level.</p>
<p>Dr. Keiji Fukuda said the emergency committee that advises the WHO's director general on whether to raise the pandemic threat level or declare a pandemic will convene again tomorrow.</p>
<p>The discordant disease pattern -- mild in the United States and Canada, more severe in Mexico -- is puzzling influenza experts.</p>
<p>Fukuda said teams from WHO, Canada and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are in or are heading to Mexico to help authorities figure out why the pattern of disease appears so different, even though genetic sequencing of viruses shows the same strain of the influenza A H1N1 swine flu is responsible.</p>

<p>A handful of Hamiltonians with links to Mexico are being monitored for swine flu after coming down with respiratory illness.</p>
<p>"We don't know whether some of the cases are swine flu or not, and we will know within the next couple of days," said Dr. Chris Mackie, associate medical officer of health. "Anyone who has been to Mexico and is displaying the relevant symptoms is being tested."</p>
<p>Canada confirmed its first cases in British Columbia and Nova Scotia this weekend as the number of ill continued to rise in Mexico and the United States.</p>
<p>There are no confirmed cases in Ontario, but Hamilton's public health department sent samples this weekend to the province's central public health lab.</p>
<p>Mackie said there are fewer than five Hamiltonians ill and none are health-care workers, teachers or students.</p>
<p>"We've had several people call us or physicians call us with people who are sick and coming back from Mexico with flu-like symptoms," said Mackie</p>
<p>Some are seriously ill, but no cases are life-threatening.</p>
<p>Any in hospital are in isolation. The rest have been asked to go into voluntary self-isolation at home until the test results come back.</p>
<p>Swine flu is spread person to person, so public health has notified those who have had close contact with those who are ill.</p>
<p>"Everyone we believe is at risk, we're in contact with them directly."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ending swine flu is top priority - City scientists scramble to make vaccine</b>
</div><div>By Jen Skerritt   </div>

</p>
<p>Work on a new vaccine to guard against human swine flu is underway in a Winnipeg lab as health officials across the continent move to contain the growing threat that could spark a worldwide influenza outbreak.</p>
<p>The mysterious disease that initially cropped up in Mexico has spread to Canada, and countries as far away as New Zealand are testing suspected cases. There are no cases reported in Manitoba so far.</p>
<p>Canadian health officials confirmed six people have tested positive for a mild form of human swine flu, with four cases in Nova Scotia and two in British Columbia.</p>
<p>The United States has reported 20 cases. Mexican officials say the disease has killed 103 people in that country and likely sickened more than 1,600 since April 13.</p>
<p>Scientists are trying to figure out why the illness appears to infect a demographic that is typically untouched by severe flu -- healthy adults between the ages of 25 and 44.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said experts from the U.S. and Canada are heading to Mexico to obtain more specifics on who has fallen ill and how the disease spreads. To date, Butler-Jones said, experts have had access to information on swine flu cases from select hospitals in Mexico, which may not be providing the full picture of who is getting sick.</p>
<p>Often, he said, seasonal flu crops up in schools and hits young adults first before spreading to older adults.</p>
<p>Although the six Canadians who tested positive for the virus were only mildly ill, Butler-Jones warned that the potential severity of swine flu should not be ignored. Border officials are on the lookout for any travellers returning from Mexico who should see a doctor. Health notices advising travellers going to and returning from Mexico of symptoms that should prompt them to seek medical attention will be posted in airports later this week.</p>
<p>At least two people have already been directed to seek care by a border agent, Butler-Jones said: "No one should underestimate this disease."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, teams of scientists from the Winnipeg-based National Microbiology Lab have started work on a vaccine to protect against H1N1 swine flu and are investigating whether the existing flu shot could offer any protection from the virus.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Plummer, the lab's scientific director, said scientists will test to see if the flu shot will protect animals from swine flu since the annual shot already contains H1N1 human flu virus. Plummer said there are still many unknowns about human swine flu, but said genetics or environmental factors could help explain why Mexico seems to be experiencing a more severe form of swine flu than Canada and the U.S.</p>
<p>Winnipeg's lab has done most of the testing of swine flu samples from Mexico. Plummer said he's had a good working relationship with Mexican health officials through the Canadian-led Global Health Security Action Group, which is why Mexican authorities approached the Winnipeg lab for help diagnosing samples on April 17. "I think we're at the beginning of this outbreak and there's a lot more that's unknown than known," Plummer said during a teleconference from Ottawa Sunday. "There are many potential explanations for severe respiratory illness in Mexico and the absence here."</p>
<p>Health officials in Canada are bracing for more cases. Dr. Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief medical officer, said it's only a matter of time before the disease surfaces here.</p>
<p>Hospital workers are on the lookout for severe respiratory illnesses.</p>
<p>Kettner said anyone experiencing severe flu symptoms should see a doctor.</p>
<p>"The virus is turning up in not only Mexico but the southern U.S. and New York and Nova Scotia and B.C. and New Zealand. When the infection makes its way around the world it's a pandemic.</p>
<p>"The bigger question is how severe is it and what is it doing?"</p>

</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -- NDP Leader Carole James expressed faith in British Columbia's health officials and didn't stir up any campaign-trail rancour over the swine flu, after two mild cases of the illness were confirmed in the province.</p>
<p>The most important thing is for the public to stay informed, Ms. James said, after a party event in Vancouver's West End to highlight severe rent increases in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>“Fear is the worst thing,” Ms. James said. “The most important thing is to make sure people are aware of what's going on – and I'm confident in B.C.'s medical health [officials].”</p>
<p>Liberal Leader Gordon Campbell said “B.C.'s been on this from the start,” calling the two cases in the province “very mild.”</p>
<p>“The really important thing to understand is if [people] have a cough or fever and they're concerned, they should call their physician. Their physician will tell them what to do next. The important thing for us is to be diligent and we are,” Mr. Campbell told reporters during a campaign event in Vancouver's Chinatown, where local candidates gathered with supporters for a luncheon.</p>
<p>“We are ready for this and we're going to keep on watching. There may be more cases that are detected over the next few days or weeks, and we'll be on top of them right away.”</p>
<p>Politicians running for re-election May 12 aren't directly involved in the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>“We take professional advice with regards to this,” Mr. Campbell said. “This is not something where there's political influence. If I can help in terms of communicating or anything like that, I will.”</p>
<p>The swine flu cases overshadowed a quiet day on the provincial election campaign trail.</p>
<p>Public health officials emphasized the two cases – men aged 25-35 who had recently returned from Mexico – were mild, and citizens should not be unduly concerned.</p>
<p>“Respiratory illness is not uncommon at this time of year,” said Danuta Skowronski, head of influenza and respiratory illnesses at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, which is operated by the provincial health service. “We don't want to put a run on physicians' offices.”</p>
<p>The two men live in the Lower Mainland and are under self-imposed seclusion in their homes at the requests of health officials. The cases were discovered through normal flu testing conducted by the disease control centre after the men had visited a doctor with mild flu symptoms. It was noted they had just returned from Mexico.</p>
<p>It is severe flu symptoms that are the key issue, Dr. Skowronski said, rather than mild incidences such as a sore throat and coughing. Symptoms to watch for include: high fever, strong aches, heavy fatigue and a sharp headache.</p>
<p>Swine flu has killed several dozen people in Mexico and sickened more than 1,000. A small number of cases have appeared elsewhere, including in Nova Scotia and the United States.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure we're taking measured precautions, that we're not unnecessarily alarming people, that we're not getting ahead of ourselves,” Dr. Skowronski said. “We don't issue alarms about a pandemic on the basis of mild illness.”</p>
<p>More cases are expected, officials said, but there is no special screening process in place, such as monitoring every passenger coming off a flight from Mexico. There is a general look-out for passengers from Mexico with severe flu symptoms.</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, Mr. Campbell gave a short speech at the Chinatown luncheon and introduced local candidates. He said a key part of his message is the Liberal Party's focus on improving Vancouver's position as a North American entry hub for Asian and Chinese goods.</p>
<p>Ms. James appeared at an event at a West End apartment building, where tenants face eviction as the owner prepares to renovate. Many such renovations are superficial – paint and the like – and are used by owners to justify large rent increases, the NDP contends. Ms. James said her party would amend the Residential Tenancy Act if she wins the election.</p>
<p>The Liberals, in an e-mail response, said it was “wrong” that the act allows, in the words of the NDP, “unjust renovictions.”</p>
<p>The Liberals said the act is clear that landlords can evict tenants with two months notice if it is shown that the units have to be vacant for renovations to occur.</p>

<p>Even as health officials around the world rush to contain the spread of a deadly swine flu, they remain in the dark on a central question: Why is new viral strain making people sick?</p>
<p>“Nobody knows right now. We just don't have enough information on it,” said Michael Gardam, director of infectious diseases prevention and control at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion.</p>
<p>Health officials worldwide are awaiting information from investigators representing the World Health Organization and U.S. Centres for Disease Control, who have travelled to Mexico to determine how dozens of people have died there since April 13, what their symptoms were, and whether they shared any characteristics such as age.</p>
<p>Karen Hunter, a CDC spokeswoman, said yesterday there have been few answers. “This is a new strain of swine flu. It's never been seen before. So we have no idea why it would be mild in some cases and more severe in other cases. And we're so early in our investigation process that we don't really have the answers.”</p>
<p>Such information is needed to target prevention strategies, Dr. Gardam said. Agencies such as the WHO are warning people to watch for flu-like symptoms -- fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, chills and fatigue. But those symptoms are shared by a wide variety of flu viruses -- so really amount to best guesses with respect to this new swine flu, Dr. Gardam said.</p>
<p>“Once you start to get more cases, you start to get a better sense: Is this affecting more people between ages of 15 and 45, are they getting worse disease? And then you can start giving people guidance,” he said.</p>
<p>Robert Brunham, executive director of the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control said the “big mystery” is: “Why are we seeing severe respiratory illnesses in Mexico and mild, otherwise typical influenza in the U.S. and Canada? We don't understand that and that's the question that all of us are paying a lot of attention to: Is there something different going on in Mexico?”</p>
<p>Many of the people affected are between the ages of 20 and 45, fuelling speculation that their deaths may have been caused by a phenomenon known as “cytokine storm,” which happens when the body's immune system goes haywire, and essentially attacks the disease so viciously that it harms the person. But Dr. Gardam warned that such conjecture is premature.</p>

</p>
<p>CALGARY -- In April, 2003, as the SARS epidemic swept across Toronto, a team of researchers on the other side of the country accomplished a minor miracle. In just six days, the Genome Sequence Centre lab in Vancouver led by Marco Marra sequenced the genetic code of the SARS virus.</p>
<p>It was a task that, at the time, often took researchers months or even a year to complete. But lives were at stake, and Mr. Marra's lab worked around the clock to accomplish something that seemed impossible.</p>
<p>Establishing the genetic code of a killer bacteria or virus can provide vital information to those looking to diagnose patients, track outbreaks and create vaccines. Yet, in a situation that still has not been addressed, Mr. Marra's lab could have sequenced the virus in half the time if it had been given funding it requested a year earlier, to establish a set of systems to rapidly sequence dangerous pathogens. Even after it proved the value of its work with SARS, that money – Mr. Marra requested several million dollars in 2002 – has not been granted.</p>
<p>Six years after Canada stumbled through the SARS crisis, that lack of funding shows that as the country prepares for another potential pandemic, even its upgraded public health system continues to suffer from serious shortfalls.</p>
<p>The handling of the 2003 SARS outbreak, which killed 44 Canadians and caused an estimated $1.5-billion in economic losses, gave rise to several commissions and hundreds of pages of reports and recommendations. While they universally praised the efforts of front-line workers, they found that the epidemic caught the country flat-footed. Information flow was muddied by the lack of a single spokesperson, hospitals had too few negative-pressure rooms to isolate the sick and health care workers had to make up pandemic strategies on the fly.</p>
<p>The lack of co-ordination between levels of government was called an “international embarrassment.” Even ethical issues about who should get treatment and how medicine should be doled out came as a surprise.</p>
<p>“SARS was an important dress rehearsal for a major global pandemic,” said Peter Singer, a professor of medicine and director at the McLaughlin-Rotman Centre for Global Health who helped draft a set of ethical guidelines for caregivers after the outbreak.</p>
<p>Today, as authorities identify the first cases of the H1N1 strain of swine flu in Canada, they say a number of changes are already bettering their performance.</p>
<p>“The fact that we could recognize this virus in Canada within a week and identify six people who are probably at the leading edge of it – we couldn't have done that six years ago,” said Robert Brunham, the executive and scientific director of the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control. “Lives are being saved.”</p>
<p>The single biggest change was the creation, in 2004, of the Public Health Agency of Canada. It has helped co-ordinate provincial agencies and testing laboratories across the country, and filled the need for a single point of authority and communication in an outbreak. At the same time, hospitals have drafted pandemic plans and boosted some of their ability to care for infectious patients by preparing more isolation rooms and hiring more staff.</p>
<p>But in a few key areas, the system remains as vulnerable today as it was six years ago. Only a tiny percentage of Canadian hospitals has access to a key lab test – called the “PCR test” – that can identify whether or not someone has a flu overnight, compared to the week it takes for a standard culture test. Public health offices remain a generation behind in their use of electronic database tracking.</p>
<p>The key problem: budgets. When the National Advisory Committee on SARS and Public Health reported in October, 2003, its two key recommendations were the establishment of a public health agency – which the government accomplished – and $700-million in new federal public health spending by 2007.</p>
<p>In 2006-2007, the last year for which a performance report is available, the Public Health Agency spent only $510-million.</p>
<p>“That 40 per cent gap in what we should be spending on public health at a federal level is an enormous gap that compromises everything public health does for this country,” said Allison McGeer, the director of infection control at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>One striking example is the use of digital technology. During SARS, health staff wasted thousands of hours managing paper files for 23,000 possible cases. While British Columbia is in the process of installing technology that would help solve the problem, it's not yet ready to go.</p>
<p>“Surveillance systems, although they're getting better, are an era away from the kinds of surveillance systems that your bank uses to track your money,” said Ms. McGeer.</p>
<p>“I don't want for a moment to suggest that we're not doing much better – this is infinitely better than the situation we were in during SARS,” she added. “At the same time, at an overall level, the important lesson [from SARS] was you need to invest in public health. And that's the lesson we haven't learned.”</p>

</p>
<p>MONTREAL -- Canadian and Mexican officials are scheduled to meet today to assess whether it's safe for thousands of Mexican agricultural workers to travel to Canada in light of the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>More than 15,000 Mexican workers are entering Canada this year under a federal seasonal farm workers' program, a number of them due to arrive in the coming days and weeks. The volatile state of the flu outbreak in Mexico is creating worries among Canadian farmers, who regard the Mexican farmhands as crucial for their production.</p>
<p>In Montreal, planes carrying Mexican farm workers have been landing every weekday evening at Trudeau International Airport, and while a flight landed on Friday, the status of today's flight is uncertain.</p>
<p>“If they put an embargo on this program, it will be catastrophic for me and the great majority of other growers,” said Jacques Notaro, a lettuce grower south of Montreal who is awaiting farm workers from Mexico this week.</p>
<p>Concerns about his labour supply are coupled with vigilance toward the dozen Mexican labourers who already arrived on his farm.</p>
<p>“Every time a worker coughs I don't take any chances – I bring him to a clinic,” Mr. Notaro said yesterday.</p>
<p>Another Quebec grower in the Mauricie region brought a Mexican farm aid to hospital over the weekend because of concerns about the flu; the employee was given a clean bill of health.</p>
<p>René Mantha, director-general of the organization that co-ordinates farm-labour placement in Quebec, is working on a “Plan B” in case Canada temporarily suspends the Mexican program. But he said a delay of even a few days can hurt local fruit and vegetable growers, for whom May and June are the busiest months.</p>
<p>“There are pretty urgent decisions to make. We can't replace thousands of workers overnight,” Mr. Mantha said. “There's a long selection and recruiting process. In the short term, it would be impossible to replace these workers. This is very serious. Everyone is worried.”</p>
<p>He said Canadian and Mexican officials are to meet in Mexico City this morning to address the issue.</p>
<p>“The idea is to avoid running risks to our population,” Mr. Mantha said. “We want to ensure the workers aren't carrying the virus.”</p>
<p>Nearly 17,000 Mexican farm workers came to Canada under the federal program last year, and between 15,000 and 20,000 are expected this year. About 300 are expected to land in Montreal this week alone.</p>
<p>Immigration Canada, which screens Mexicans for the farm-labour program, is working with the Public Health Agency of Canada and other agencies to assess current risks.</p>
<p>In response to the virus outbreak, all temporary foreign workers from Mexico are required to undergo a pre-departure examination, which includes a questionnaire, physical exam and fever measure performed by two doctors, an aide to Immigration Minister Jason Kenney said yesterday.</p>
<p>The examination is done prior to departure, at the time of permit collection in Mexico City.</p>
<p>Mexican workers form the majority of employees who come to Quebec farms. Several farms also employ workers from Guatemala, but they transit through Mexico to get to Canada.</p>
<p>In Ontario, which gets the largest share of Mexican farm workers in Canada, growers are also warily watching the virus's progress.</p>
<p>“It is a concern and it's something we're going to monitor,” said Ray Duc, a grape grower in Niagara-on-the-Lake and board director of the Ontario Fruit and Vegetable Growers' Association. He said Mexican workers are “a good, reliable source of help, and we're dependent on them.”</p>

</p>
<p>QWhat is swine influenza?</p>
<p>A The World Health Organization calls viral swine flu "a highly contagious acute respiratory disease of pigs" that is present year round, with spikes in colder months, just like in humans. It is well established in Canadian pigs, without any unduly adverse effects on either the pigs themselves or the pork sold for human consumption.</p>
<p>QWhy do people get sick, then?</p>
<p>A Usually, human cases of swine flu arise from direct contact with live pigs, and can run the spectrum from asymptomatic infection to full blown pneumonia and death. In the past two years, the WHO is only aware of such infections in Spain and the United States. The rarity of direct swine-to-human infection also means that very few people have an immunity to the viruses, nor are there any vaccines. Eating pork is rarely the cause, if ever, because influenza viruses do not survive proper cooking.</p>
<p>Q</p>
<p>A The key to this outbreak is human-to-human transmission, which suggests a new kind of virus that has genetically adapted from the traditional strains of swine flu. As Dr. Margaret Chan of the WHO put it in a weekend briefing, "A new disease is, by definition, poorly understood," but there is an epidemiological context that is well understood. Like birds in avian flu, pigs are like living genetic laboratories, in which viruses can combine and adapt to create newer versions of themselves with unpredictable results. Even a single virus that is able to adapt to human transmission will only have to infect one person to launch a pandemic. Once the "species barrier" is crossed, the new human virus can carry on through the population via sneezes and unwashed hands, no matter what happens to Pig Zero.</p>
<p>So why is a WHO crisis team in Geneva monitoring the Mexico outbreak?</p>
<p>What the #!%*? is an occasional series answering the many questions that arise from the day's news.</p>
<p>Follow it online at nationalpost.com/posted</p>
<p>How serious is it?</p>
<p>A The regular flu is serious enough. Despite a vaccination per capita of almost one in three people, Canada still sees around 4,000 deaths annually from influenza. In comparison, the 2003 SARS strain had a far higher fatality rate of about 10%, but caused less than 800 total deaths globally. But with 81 deaths so far in Mexico, and more expected in the United States and possibly Canada, this strain appears particularly dangerous. The WHO has kept its pandemic threat level steady at three, which means swine flu is able to spread through close contact, but not so efficiently that it can sustain a community-level outbreak. Phase four would be reached when the disease remains sustained in a community. Phase five would require human-to-human transmission in two WHO regions, and phase six, the "pandemic" phase, requires spread between these global regions.</p>
<p>How much antiviral medication has Canada stockpiled for a flu pandemic?</p>
<p>A More than 60 million doses of various types, enough for perhaps six million people, but the release of them is tied to a similar U. S. program, and so far it has not been activated.</p>
<p>Q Will we see the SARS scanners at the airport again?</p>
<p>A Not yet, at least. Officials have not changed screening procedures, but are trained to watch for obvious symptoms, and can access expert advice on short order. "Everyone's on heightened awareness, paying particular attention</p>
<p>to flights from Mexico," said Alisa Cooper, a spokeswoman for the <span class="companylink">Vancouver International Airport Authority</span>.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine Flu Lands in Canada; GLOBAL CRISIS: Mexican virus spreads north as U.S. declares a public emergency</b>
</div><div>Iain Marlow   </div>
<div>in Toronto Richard J. Brennan in Ottawa</div>
<div>958 words</div><div>27 April 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Ontario health officials are maintaining a vigilant watch for cases of confirmed swine flu in the province but, as fears of a possible global pandemic continue to spread, the only cases to emerge so far in Canada are in Nova Scotia and British Columbia.</p>
<p>All six Canadian cases - four at a Windsor, N.S., school, two in B.C.'s Lower Mainland - were linked to Mexican travel. Unlike Mexico, where the flu is believed to have killed more than 100 people and sparked fears of a pandemic, the Canadian cases were so mild they did not require hospitalization.</p>
<p>But as Canadian health officials tried to ease fears yesterday, they also warned against complacency.</p>
<p>"The swine flu symptoms seen in Canada have thankfully been relatively mild and the patients are recovering. These are Canada's first confirmed cases but ... these cases are likely not the last we'll see in Canada," federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq told an Ottawa press conference yesterday.</p>
<p>Passengers returning from Mexico at Toronto's Pearson airport yesterday wore masks during their flights. Canadian border guards who greeted them wore masks and latex gloves.</p>
<p>"We were just afraid that maybe people, if they were carrying the disease, might sneeze or cough or anything," said Emerson Abrego, 45, who returned from his homeland on a Mexicana flight from Mexico City.</p>
<p>He called the mood in Mexico "scary" and said nightclubs and other public places have been closed until the flu threat passes. "The police and military, they are on the street over there stopping everybody to give them a mask."</p>
<p>David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said the fact only mild cases have been confirmed so far means little. "Simply because we are having milder cases nobody should take this for granted in any way. That's why we are paying very close attention," he said.</p>
<p>"It's too soon to say where this will lead us," Butler-Jones said. "It doesn't mean we won't see more severe illness or potentially deaths."</p>
<p>To protect yourself, Butler-Jones advises washing your hands often and thoroughly, using a hand sanitizer, coughing or sneezing into an arm or sleeve rather than your hands, staying at home if you have flu-like symptoms and getting a flu vaccine, which he says may offer limited protection.</p>
<p>So far the only deaths have been in Mexico, where officials last night said there were 1,614 possible cases of swine flu, including 103 suspected deaths. People are staying inside or wearing masks in public.</p>
<p>There have been 20 confirmed infections in the U.S., which declared swine flu a public health emergency yesterday; six in Canada; and possible cases in New Zealand, Israel and Europe. But while Canadian and international health officials grow more concerned, a Toronto expert warned against panic.</p>
<p>Any flu has a wide range of symptoms and the severe, complicated cases get the most attention, said Dr. Andrew Simor, head of microbiology and infectious diseases at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. "But they're not all like that and certainly the (cases) we've seen in the U.S. and Canada have been much milder," he said.</p>
<p>Canada's experience with SARS - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - in 2003 gave health professionals a unique expertise in handling outbreaks like this, and Ontario health officials say the province's emergency departments and clinics are well prepared and have protocols in place for handling any flu outbreak.</p>
<p>As well, some doctors noted, warm weather will help curb person-to person transmission.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Plummer, scientific director general for the federal public health agency, said the outbreak is only beginning "and there is a lot more unknown than is known."</p>
<p>Plummer noted Canada has done much of the testing of the virus for Mexico because of a prior relationship between the two countries with respect to infectious disease.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, the government has taken drastic measures - urging its populace to avoid Mexico and ordering the detention at hospital of anyone arriving with symptoms of a respiratory illness after travelling through a region with confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Ontario health officials were investigating 11 possible cases across Ontario, said Steve Erwin, spokesperson for Minister of Health David Caplan. By yesterday evening, however, provincial public health officials said no cases had been confirmed.</p>
<p>The process of confirmation is complicated because flu-like symptoms can be caused by a variety of other, non-fatal viruses.</p>
<p>Canadian officials have not yet warned against travel to Mexico, but several airlines, including Air Canada and WestJet, were waiving cancellation fees for passengers wishing to postpone or change flights to Mexico City.</p>
<p>Patrick Chuidian, who returned from Mexico on Friday after a one-week visit, greeted his wife and daughter yesterday after their three-month stay there.</p>
<p>"Of course we're worried, but I've been checking around with the family doctor, so we're okay," Lourdes Chuidian said in Spanish through her husband. She said schools and universities in Mexico have been closed for a week and concerts and movies have been suspended for 10 days. "Traffic is very good now because people are scared and they're staying at home," she said. "Driving around Mexico City is perfect - no traffic."</p>
<p>Patrick Chuidian, a nurse at St. Joseph's Health Centre, said he had to be cleared by occupational health and safety inspectors before returning to work. He was warned to stay home if cold symptoms develop within two weeks.</p>

</p>
<p>How many have died? Have Canadians been affected?</p>
<p>All the fatalities have been in Mexico; according to latest government figures, 103 people have died from the flu virus, and more than 1,600 likely sickened with the virus since April 13. Six cases have been reported in Canada; 20 in the U.S., but in all cases symptoms were reported as mild and patients are recovering.</p>
<p>What kind of flu is it</p>
<p>and how is it spreading?</p>
<p>The virus is an influenza A virus, carrying the designation H1N1 and is spreading from person to person. It contains DNA from avian, swine and human viruses. Passed on by sneezing, coughing or when people pick up the virus from their hands, the virus likely originated in pigs. You can't get it by eating pork.</p>
<p>How serious is it?</p>
<p>WHO has declared the flu a "public health emergency of international concern." It poses the biggest risk of a large-scale pandemic since avian flu re-emerged in 2003, killing 257 out of 421 infected in 15 countries.</p>
<p>Can I travel to Mexico?</p>
<p>Yes. There is no government travel advisory against going, but airlines including Air Canada and WestJet will cancel rebooking fees if you want to reschedule your trip. If you go, the Public Health Agency of Canada suggests using the same measures you'd use to avoid seasonal influenza - a flu shot and good personal hygiene.</p>
<p>I'm back from Mexico and think I have swine flu symptoms. What do I do?</p>
<p>Call your doctor or call Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0007 to speak to a nurse. Do not go to your doctor's office, walk-in clinic or hospital emergency department without calling ahead and letting them know so they can take precautions to isolate you from other patients.</p>

<p>Two young adults on the Lower Mainland have been diagnosed with the swine flu virus that has caused serious illness and a reported 103 deaths in Mexico, Premier Gordon Campbell confirmed yesterday.</p>
<p>Campbell said the B.C. cases were not as severe as the cases in Mexico and the patients are now at home.</p>
<p>Public health officials, however, continue to stay on top of the potential outbreak.</p>
<p>Dr. Danuta Skowronski, a spokeswoman for the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, said both patients had links to someone who had travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>"This is not scary monsters," she said at a news conference in Vancouver. "We had a surveillance system on high alert to be able to detect these cases and we have." Doctors aren't sure why the illness has been so deadly in Mexico and mild in other countries, said Skowronski.</p>
<p>"The six confirmed cases in Canada are different from what we are seeing in Mexico," she said. "We do expect more cases." Campbell urged the public to keep informed, follow proper hygiene practices such as regular hand-washing, and seek medical advice if necessary.</p>
<p>"If you feel like you've got a fever and a cough, and you're coming from Mexico, it's a good idea to let people know," he said. "If it gets worse, you should certainly go and talk directly with your doctor." Campbell, who is in the middle of campaigning for re-election, made the comments following a rally in Chinatown. He will receive regular briefings on the issue, and said the election will not interfere with public-health efforts.</p>
<p>"We're going to make it a priority. We have a very good Centre for Disease Control and public health protocol in place.</p>
<p>"In Mexico, they've lost some lives. We certainly don't want to see that happen in Canada." The B.C. cases and another four in Nova Scotia are the first confirmed Canadian cases since an outbreak of the illness began in Mexico several days ago. About 20 people in the United States are infected.</p>
<p>Air Canada and Westjet announced they were waiving change fees for passengers booked on flights to and from Mexico until Thursday.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia health officials said two of the four victims in that province, all students at the same private school, recently visited Mexico. None of the Canadian patients has been hospitalized.</p>
<p>Joe Seagram, headmaster of the private school in Windsor, N.S., said 21 people were in isolation: 17 students and four staff. They are being isolated for seven days as a precaution.</p>

<p>Warren D. Ward, 48, was in high school when the swine flu threat of 1976 swept the U.S. The Whittier, Calif., man remembers the episode vividly because a relative had died in the 1918 flu pandemic and the '76 illness was feared to be a direct descendant of that deadly virus.</p>
<p>"The government wanted everyone to get vaccinated," recalls Ward. "But the epidemic never really broke out. It was a threat that never materialized."</p>
<p>What did materialize were cases of a rare side effect believed to be linked to the shot. The unexpected development cut short the vaccination effort -- an unprecedented national campaign -- after only 10 weeks. The episode triggered an enduring public backlash against flu vaccination, embarrassed the federal government and cost the director of the U.S. Center for Disease Control, now known as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, his job.</p>
<p>The pandemic fears of the time and the resulting vaccine controversy may be fueling some of the public's -- and media's -- anxiety about the current outbreak, say health officials.</p>
<p>Ward said his family discussed the vaccine in 1976 and decided against it. If a vaccine is ordered for this latest threat, he says,"I'm not getting it. I felt back then like it was a bunch of baloney."</p>
<p>The swine flu brush of 1976 -- some call it a "debacle" -- holds critical lessons for the government and health officials who must decide how to react to the new swine flu threat in the days and weeks ahead.</p>
<p>For starters, officials must keep the public informed. They must admit what they know and don't know. They must have a plan ready should the health threat become dangerous. And they must soothe everyone's nerves with reassurances that there is no need to worry in the meantime.</p>
<p>It's a tall order. Doubts about the government's ability to handle a possible flu pandemic linger, says Dr. Richard P. Wenzel, chairman of internal medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University who diagnosed some of the early cases in 1976. Health experts today, however, know much more about influenza, vaccines and the public's reaction to both, he says.</p>
<p>"I think we're going to have to be cautious," Wenzel said. "Hopefully, there will be a lot of good, honest public-health discussion about what happened in 1976."</p>
<p>Officials should be prepared for plenty of second-guessing, especially for any decisions regarding vaccination, which was at the core of the 1976 controversy, says Dr. David J. Sencer, the CDC director who led the government's response to the '76 threat and was later fired.</p>
<p>"There were good things and bad things about it," says Sencer, who is retired. "People have to make science the priority. They have to rely on science rather than politics."</p>
<p>The question of whether politics overtook science in 1976 still haunts the people involved and has been the fodder of books, articles and discussions.</p>
<p>The panic in 1976 was due in part to the belief ‚ now known to be erroneous -- that the 1918-1919 flu pandemic, which killed half a million Americans and an estimated 20 million people worldwide, was caused by a virus with swine components. Recent research suggests instead that it was avian flu -- but that seems unlikely to assuage the anxiety over the current outbreak.</p>
<p>The episode began in February 1976, when an Army recruit at Fort Dix, N.J., fell ill and died suddenly from a swine flu virus thought to be similar to the 1918 strain.</p>
<p>Several other soldiers at the base also became ill. Shortly thereafter, Wenzel and his colleagues reported two cases of the flu strain in Virginia.</p>
<p>"That raised the concern that the original cluster at Fort Dix had spread beyond New Jersey," says Wenzel, the immediate past president of the International Society for Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>At CDC, Sencer solicited the opinions of infectious disease specialists nationwide and, in March, called on President Gerald Ford and Congress to begin mass inoculation. The $137 million program began in early October, but within days reports emerged that the vaccine appeared to increase the risk for Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological condition that can be fatal.</p>
<p>Waiting in long lines at schools and clinics, more than 40 million Americans -- almost 25 per cent of the population -- received the swine flu vaccine before the program was halted in December after only 10 weeks.</p>
<p>More than 500 people are thought to have developed Guillain-Barre syndrome after receiving the vaccine and 25 died. No one completely understands what causes Guillain-Barre in certain people, but the condition can develop after a bout with infection or following surgery or vaccination. The federal government paid millions in damages to people who developed the condition or their families.</p>
<p>But the pandemic, which some experts estimated at the time could infect 50 million to 60 million Americans, never unfolded. Only about 200 cases of swine flu and one death were ultimately reported in the U.S., according to the CDC.</p>
<p>The public viewed the entire episode as political farce, says Sencer, instead of a dedicated, science-based effort to protect public health. He says the government chose to err on the side of caution and risk scorn -- something that experts working on the current outbreak may also face.</p>
<p>"If we had that knowledge then, we might have done things differently," Sencer says."We did not know what sort of virus we were dealing with in those days. No one knew we would have Guillain-Barre syndrome. The flu vaccine had been used for many years without that happening. If that hadn't happened, no one would have had any concern about the program."</p>
<p>Wenzel also recommended vaccination in 1976. "It was a tremendous program," he says. "It was a great effort. It just had unexpected, unfortunate side effects."</p>
<p>In Mexico, where several dozen people have died from the current swine flu outbreak, government officials are under fire for their handling of the situation. But people fail to understand the challenges faced by health officials in the face of a mysterious threat, says Dr. Peter Katona, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>"You have to look at not only 1976 but 1918," he says. "The pandemic flu that occurred in 1918 lasted a year and a half. In 1976, we didn't know what was going to happen. The virus might burn out. It might proliferate. These viruses have a mind of their own, and we don't know how to predict what will happen."</p>
<p>CDC officials have been wisely circumspect in their comments about the current outbreak, Sencer says.</p>
<p>"I like the fact that they have said, 'We may change our minds,' " he says. "Don't expect health officials to have the answers overnight. These things need time to be sorted out. We're still in the learning curve."</p>

<p>Q: What is swine flu?</p>
<p>A: Swine flu is a general term for influenza viruses adapted to pigs, causing a respiratory disease in the animals. There are many different strains. Swine flu can infect humans and in such cases most often is transmitted from a pig to someone handling pigs. Swine flu can pass from human to human through coughing, sneezing or touching infected people or surfaces and then touching your mouth or nose. It is not contracted by eating thoroughly cooked pork.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of swine flu?</p>
<p>A: The symptoms are similar to regular types of flu seen every winter: fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, poor appetite, body aches and chills. Some people also have nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. People who have other illnesses are at higher risk for developing complications from flu, such as pneumonia.</p>
<p>Q: Is it contagious?</p>
<p>A: The virus is contagious, but health officials cannot yet say how easily the current strain of swine flu spreads from person to person. People are usually contagious for as long as they are symptomatic, typically four to five days for adults and longer for children. Some children may be contagious for a few days even after recovering.</p>
<p>Q: How dangerous is this swine flu?</p>
<p>A: In Mexico, health officials have confirmed that 20 deaths were linked with swine flu; dozens more are suspected. But all known cases in the U.S. have been mild. Experts don't know how deadly swine flu is because they don't know how many people have been infected overall. The World Health Organization says that the mortality rate from swine flu is 1 percent to 4 percent.</p>
<p>Q: How is it diagnosed?</p>
<p>A: A respiratory specimen must be collected within the first four or five days of illness. The viral specimen is then sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing.</p>
<p>Q: What is the incubation period?</p>
<p>A: Only a day or two.</p>
<p>Q: How can flu be prevented?</p>
<p>A: Standard methods of prevention include covering your mouth when you cough and sneeze. Use tissues and throw them in the trash immediately. Wash your hands often with soap and water. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Avoid sick people. If you become sick, stay home from work or school. People who know they have been exposed can obtain a prescription for the antiviral drugs oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza).</p>
<p>Q: Is there a vaccine?</p>
<p>A: The vaccine for seasonal flu that was available this past winter will not work against the swine flu. The CDC has not yet ordered production of a swine flu vaccine. Development of such a vaccine would take at least four months.</p>
<p>Q: What is the treatment?</p>
<p>A: Of the four antiviral drugs, only two --oseltamivir or zanamivir -- are thought to work against swine flu. These drugs may make the illness milder and work best if started within two days of getting sick. There is no other treatment other than rest.</p>

</p>
<p>A new flu virus that has killed up to 81 people in Mexico could start a global epidemic, the World Health Organization warned Saturday as the disease spread further in the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>The Mexican government says the flu has probably killed 81 people, raising the likely death toll from 68, and that more than 1,300 people were believed to have been infected with the new strain, which causes severe respiratory illnesses.</p>
<p>Most of the dead in Mexico were aged between 25 and 45.</p>
<p>In Mexico's capital of 20 mil-lion people, where most of the victims have died, residents were buying surgical masks and foodstuffs Saturday.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, after a meeting of WHO's emergency committee, the UN agency said it was recommending that" all countries intensify surveillance for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia."</p>
<p>On Friday, Canadian Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said there are no confirmed cases of the new H1N1 flu strain--a mixture of swine, human and avian flu viruses--in Canada.</p>
<p>"While there is no immediate threat to Canadians at this time, we will always be vigilant," Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>Reports that two people were quarantined in Montreal, suspected of being infected with the strain, were strongly denied Saturday.</p>
<p>Johanne Simard, an official of the Montreal regional health board, called the reports "rumour" and said there are no cases of swine flu at Lakeshore General Hospital and no quarantines in effect.</p>
<p>Also Saturday, the B. C. Health Ministry said there have been no reported cases of the severe respiratory illness in B.C., but issued an information bulletin that stated: "Based on currently available information, the Public Health Agency of Canada has issued a travel health notice regarding swine flu in Mexico, California and Texas."</p>
<p>It did not call for an official advisory or travel ban to Mexico, however.</p>
<p>So far, the swine flu strain has been confirmed only in Mexico and a handful of U. S. states.</p>
<p>Eleven cases, none fatal, have been confirmed in California, Kansas and Texas, and eight schoolchildren in New York City caught a Type A influenza virus that was likely to be the swine flu, health officials said Saturday.</p>
<p>In Colombia, five people who arrived from Mexico with flu symptoms were being monitored. There is also one possible case in London -- a member of an aircrew who was taken to a London hospital as a precaution after developing flu-like symptoms on a flight from Mexico City.</p>
<p>As far away as Hong Kong and Japan, health officials stepped up checks of travellers with flu-like symptoms, and the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was actively looking for new infections in the United States.</p>
<p>"We are worried, and because we are worried, we are acting aggressively on a number of fronts," the CDC's Dr.Anne Schuchat told reporters. "The situation is serious."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Washington Post reported Saturday that U.S. officials were unaware of the growing out-break in Mexico for days after Mexico started bringing in protective measures. And the newspaper said Canadian officials knew the deaths were caused by the new strain before their U. S. counterparts--it was scientists at the Winnipeg-based National Microbiology Lab who confirmed the new strain of flu in samples sent by Mexican authorities.</p>
<p>WHO chief Margaret Chan said in a teleconference the outbreak is "clearly an animal strain of the H1N1 virus and it has pandemic potential because it is infecting people.</p>
<p>"However, we cannot say on the basis of currently available laboratory, epidemiological and clinical evidence whether or not it will indeed cause a pandemic."</p>
<p>The United Nations health agency has warned for several years that a new virus strain could spark a human influenza pandemic that could sweep around the globe and kill millions.</p>
<p>"Experts at WHO and elsewhere believe that the world is now closer to another influenza pandemic than at any time since 1968,when the last of the previous century's three pandemics occurred,"WHO said.</p>
<p>The "Hong Kong" flu, as it was called, killed about one million people globally.</p>
<p>WHO's pandemic alert currently stands at Level 3, which indicates "no or very limited human-to-human transmission."</p>
<p>WHO officials have not decided yet whether to increase the alert level to 4 or higher, saying Saturday that "more information is needed before a decision could be made concerning the appropriateness of the current Phase 3."</p>

</p>
<p>Mexican police arrested two people Saturday for hawking surgical masks for 25 times their regular price to people scurrying to cover their faces from a deadly outbreak of a new flu, a media report said. A 35-year-old woman and her 15-year-old brother were trying to sell a pile of about 1,000 face masks at a subway station in front of a major public hospital in Mexico's crowded capital for 50 pesos each -- nearly $4, the daily Reforma reported.</p>
<p>Pharmacies in Mexico City sell the masks in packs and each costs about two pesos. But many had sold out as residents cleared the shelves after the new strain of swine flu killed as many as 81 people across Mexico.</p>
<p>"They'd managed to sell a few, but we received a complaint and we took them before a judge," Reforma's online edition quoted a police spokesman as saying. Mexico City's backstreets are a den of street stalls run by vendors who produce fake handbags as soon as they hit catwalks and lay out pirated DVDs of movies barely released to cinemas.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Few alter plans to travel despite flu outbreak; Ottawa-area residents still booking trips to Mexico, agents report</b>

</p>
<p>An outbreak of deadly swine flu in Mexico doesn't appear to have deterred Ottawa-area residents from taking their vacations in the sun-soaked country.</p>
<p>Local travel agents say that while they've received some questions of concern about the situation in Mexico, none of their clients have cancelled already booked vacations. "I haven't had one call concerning Mexico," Lorna Sale, an agent with Handa Travel, said Saturday.</p>
<p>Nicole Kirouac, an agent with Sears Travel, said that while some customers have expressed "moderate concern" about the situation, none of those who have already booked trips to Mexico are cancelling.</p>
<p>An unusual strain of swine flu in various regions of Mexico -- Mexico City, San Luis Potosi, Oaxaca and Baja California Norte -- is being blamed in the deaths of as many as 81 people. More than 1,300 cases of influenza have been reported. Most of those who've died are aged between 25 and 45.</p>
<p>Mexicans have taken to wearing surgical masks when they go outside. Authorities have closed schools, museums, libraries and cancelled public events throughout the country.</p>
<p>What particularly concerns experts is the uniqueness of the virus and the rapidity with which it has spread. The virus combines genetic material from pigs, birds and humans in a way that researchers have not previously encountered. "We are very, very concerned, said Thomas Abraham, a spokesman for the World Health Organization. "We have what appears to be a novel virus and it has spread from human to human."</p>
<p>So far, though, WHO has stopped short of declaring a pandemic, although officials held emergency meetings Saturday at the organization's headquarters in Geneva to consider whether to raise the pandemic alert level or issue travel advisories.</p>
<p>A flu pandemic occurs when a type A influenza virus undergoes a radical mutation -- known as an antigenic shift -- and is suddenly able to infect people. The resulting worldwide epidemic is known as a pandemic.</p>
<p>Health authorities around the world went on high alert for a potential pandemic when this new virus crossed the Mexican border into the United States.</p>
<p>Eleven cases have been confirmed in California, Kansas and Texas, and eight schoolchildren in New York City caught a type A influenza virus that was likely to be the swine flu, health officials said Saturday.</p>
<p>However, a U.S. authorities have stopped short of warning people to avoid Mexico.</p>
<p>Similarly, Canada's Foreign Affairs department has not issued a travel advisory for Mexico, although the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends that those travelling to Mexico follow the same precautionary measures as with seasonal influenza. These include receiving a seasonal flu vaccine, washing your hands often, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when ill. Anyone who has travelled to Mexico recently and develops symptoms of influenza or severe respiratory illness, especially high fever, is urged to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>To date, there have been no reported cases of this new strain of influenza in Canada.</p>
<p>Local travel agents, meanwhile, say they'll take their cue from Foreign Affairs on what to advise clients planning to travel to Mexico. Until a travel advisory is issued, they don't expect many people will be cancelling their Mexican vacations. As Eileen Villemaire, an agent with Tripcentral.ca, pointed out, many going to Mexico head for places like Cancun, Puerto Vallarta and the Mayan Riviera, where the resorts and hotels often have their own water purification systems.</p>
<p>"I had one lady who was just a little concerned about the situation, but she only bought travel insurance just in case," said David Moore, an agent with Adventure Travel. "People are still booking for Mexico."</p>

<p>A Winnipeg woman was brought to a city hospital by ambulance Friday night after she and her family feared she may have contracted swine flu during a recent vacation in Mexico.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service attended the woman's house and brought her to the Victoria General Hospital, where she was put into isolation until health officials determined she did not have a severe respiratory illness.</p>
<p>A Winnipeg Regional Health Authority spokeswoman confirmed the hospital had treated a patient who had been at risk of contracting a severe respiratory infection in Mexico.</p>
<p>"The proper protocol was followed, which meant the patient is put in a single room and anyone who goes in and visits is gowned and masked," the WRHA spokeswoman said. "She was put into isolation."</p>
<p>The woman's doctor consulted with a provincial medical officer of health on call, and they determined she did not have a severe respiratory illness.</p>
<p>"This was not a reportable case," said a Manitoba Health spokeswoman.</p>
<p>The woman was treated and released from hospital.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Quebec's health ministry and hospital officials confirmed Saturday that the province has no confirmed cases of the swine flu that has gripped Mexico.</p>
<p>But they refused to comment on media reports that a woman placed in quarantine subsequently tested negative for the flu virus.</p>
<p>"We don't have any confirmed cases, that's what's important," Karine White, spokeswoman for Quebec's ministry of health, told The Canadian Press.</p>
<p>"If there is a confirmed case, you'll be informed."</p>
<p>Lakeshore General Hospital spokesman Louis-Pascal Cyr told CTV News Saturday that the two patients were in isolation for further investigation as a precaution after returning from Mexico. One of the patients was later released and both tested negative for the virus, CTV reported.</p>
<p>"Our infection-control doctors are in direct link with the public health (department)," Cyr told The Canadian Press.</p>
<p>"Whenever a doctor suspects something we call them. It's our people that told public health the results of the investigation. We were in touch with them today."</p>
<p>But Cyr wouldn't comment on any specific case seen at the hospital.</p>
<p>White said the province's health authorities had been placed on high alert.</p>

<p>The deadly new strain of human swine flu that has emerged in Mexico and the United States has not shown up in Canada, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said yesterday.</p>
<p>"Canada is working hand in hand with the World Health Organization and our partners both internationally and within Canada to respond quickly to this developing situation," she said at a news conference where, where she also said there are no confirmed cases in Canada.</p>
<p>The health minister was joined by chief public health officer David Butler-Jones, who said a handful of cases in Canada are being looked at, but so far none has turned out to be swine flu. "If we find any, Canadians will know about it,"he said.</p>
<p>Results from samples tested at Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg helped Mexican authorities confirm yesterday that they are dealing with an outbreak of the same human swine flu that has been detected in eight people in the United States. The Canadian laboratory was contacted on April 17 by the Mexican government and asked to test the samples, which were received Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mexico is a major tourist destination for Canadians, and Butler-Jones said that, while the developments are "very concerning,"the government is not issuing a travel advisory.</p>
<p>Canadians who have returned from Mexico in the past two weeks and are experiencing flu-type symptoms should contact their doctor, Canadian health officials said.</p>

<p>Montreal hospitals have taken extra precautions but none has reported any confirmed or suspected cases of swine flu.</p>
<p>At the McGill University Health Centre, staff have gone through a pandemic-flu preparations checklist, determining that they have enough N95 respiratory masks on hand in the event of a confirmed case.</p>
<p>"The most active thing we've done is modified our triage in the ER just to make sure the nurses who are triaging are checking for fever and coughs and asking anyone whether they've been back from Mexico," said MUHC public-relations official Rebecca Burns.</p>
<p>The MUHC has also double-checked its negative-pressure isolation rooms to make sure they are functioning properly.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Montreal Public Health Department issued a "call for vigilance" to health-care professionals to pay attention to any patients with a severe respiratory infection, and to notice symptoms like a sore throat, joint and muscle pain and physical exhaustion. The health department recommended that any patients with such flu-like symptoms who have recently returned from Mexico be placed in isolation.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Laboratories in Canada and the United States confirmed yesterday that an outbreak of unusual illnesses in Mexico is caused by swine flu viruses very similar to those found in eight people in California and Texas.</p>
<p>The findings are further proof that there is person-to-person spread of a new flu virus to which many people may have little or no immunity -- key ingredients for the development of a flu pandemic. But international authorities, including those at the World Health Organization, were not ready to say that is what the world is watching.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization signalled it was convening a meeting of experts -- likely by teleconference -- who will advise Director General Margaret Chan on whether to raise the pandemic alert level from the current Phase 3 to 4 or beyond. Phase 6 is a pandemic.</p>
<p>In Canada, officials said while public health authorities have investigated a number of cases of illness in people returning from Mexico, to date there have been no positive findings.</p>
<p>"There's no confirmed cases in Canada,'' said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canadian's chief public health officer. "We're working very closely with the Mexicans and the Americans and continuing to provide technical support.''</p>
<p>The WHO said yesterday there have been no cases seen outside of Mexico and the U.S., though they urged countries to be on the lookout.</p>
<p>Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg tested a variety of samples sent by Mexican authorities earlier this week because the Mexicans were having problems diagnosing what was behind a respiratory outbreak that was sickening hundreds.</p>
<p>To date, 20 deaths have been attributed to the virus in Mexico, 40 others were being investigated and at least 943 across the country were sick from the suspected flu. In Mexico City, authorities closed schools, museums, libraries and movie theatres yesterday to try to limit spread.</p>
<p>In contrast, only one of the American cases was hospitalized and that person had other medical conditions.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg lab found 16 samples containing the unusual influenza A H1N1 virus that American authorities discovered in California and then Texas in the past week.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said Canada was on the alert after the Americans notified the World Health Organization of the findings on April 17. When Mexico then sought help diagnosing an unusual respiratory illness, he said it was hard not to think there might be a link.</p>
<p>"The spidey senses did go off,'' Butler-Jones said in an interview.</p>
<p>The acting head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Rich Besser, said the CDC's labs also confirmed seven cases in 14 samples sent from Mexico, and that early analysis of the viruses suggested they are very similar to those responsible for the American cases.</p>
<p>Besser revealed U.S. authorities have raised their confirmed case count to eight, with discovery of an additional infection in a child living in San Diego. The person has since recovered.</p>
<p>Besser said the Centers are hearing from the public that they are concerned, adding: "We are worried as well.''</p>
<p>"Our concern has grown since yesterday in light of what we've learned since then,'' he said.</p>
<p>Heightened anxiety was also apparent among WHO officials in Geneva. The organization activated its 24-hour emergency operations centre yesterday. Both Canada and the U.S. have activated theirs as well.</p>
<p>It wasn't clear when the decision would be taken on the pandemic-alert level, though experts expect events to move quickly in the coming days.</p>
<p>The viruses responsible for the cases are made up predominantly of swine flu genes. They are influenza A viruses from the H1N1 subtype.</p>
<p>Though human H1N1 viruses have been circulating for decades, it is not clear how much protection previous infection with them would confer against a swine flu virus and in particular this swine flu virus, which looks unlike any experts have seen before.</p>
<p>Flu viruses from an animal source -- whether pigs, birds or other mammals -- have the potential to cause pandemics because they are generally so different from human viruses that people have little or no immunity to them.</p>
<p>Widespread illness would be expected to occur if the viruses take off and become a pandemic strain. But the severity of the illness caused depends on the virus, and at present these viruses seem to be causing symptoms similar to regular flu, said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases expert at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>"What I'm feeling best about is that it does not seem to be a terrible illness. And if this is going to go, then it's going to be at least to some degree manageable,'' she said, noting that even though Mexico is reporting deaths, there are no reports yet that hospitals there are being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Facts about swine flu</p>
<p>What is swine flu?</p>
<p>Swine flu is a respiratory illness caused by a type A influenza virus, usually of the subtype H1N1, that triggers outbreaks in pigs fairly regularly. It can also transfer from pigs to humans, from humans to pigs and from humans to humans.</p>
<p>Four main virus subtypes -- H1N1, H1N2, H3N2 and H3N1 -- have been isolated in pigs, though the virus, like all influenza viruses, constantly mutates. When influenza viruses from different species infect pigs, the viruses can trade genes to create new versions that mix swine, human and/or avian influenza.</p>
<p>The swine H1N1 virus is not the same as the human H1N1 virus, so vaccines for the latter won't protect from the former.</p>
<p>Can humans catch swine flu?</p>
<p>Yes, but it is not common. Usually, this happens to people who are in contact with pigs, though there are some documented cases of human-to-human transfer. Human-to-human transmission is believed to occur much like the regular flu, through coughing, sneezing and other contact. Eating pork does not transmit the virus. The symptoms resemble those of the regular flu virus.</p>
<p>How can swine flu be diagnosed and treated?</p>
<p>Diagnosing requires a respiratory specimen taken during the first four or five days of infection, to be analyzed in a lab. The virus seems to respond to antiviral drugs, including those Canadian health authorities have been stockpiling in case of a flu pandemic.</p>
<p>When has it happened before?</p>
<p>The best-known case of swine flu is a 1976 outbreak at an army barracks in Fort Dix, N.J., which sickened four soldiers and killed one. There have been no major outbreaks recorded in Canada.</p>
<p>How is swine flu H1N1 virus different from SARS and avian flu H5N1 virus?</p>
<p>All three come from animals, but SARS, a corona virus, and the avian flu are poorly adapted to infecting humans. As a result, it is fairly difficult for humans to catch either virus or pass them on to others, though the effects can prove deadly when infection occurs.</p>

<p>Mexican Health Minister Jose Cordova said as many as 68 deaths may be tied to an outbreak of a new strain of swine flu that's also been seen in parts of the U.S.</p>
<p>At least 20 deaths are confirmed as linked to the virus, and about 1,000 people in the Mexico City area are showing symptoms of the illness. Schools, national museums, theaters and libraries in the capital district will be closed indefinitely. The government will distribute breathing masks to curtail the disease's spread, Cordova said in Mexico City.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones advised prospective travellers to consult the Public Health Agency of Canada's website for tips on how to reduce the risk of getting sick while travelling.</p>
<p>The public health agency has asked health professionals across the country to increase their vigilance and report any unusual influenza-like illnesses. Canadians who have returned from Mexico in the past two weeks and are experiencing flu-type symptoms should contact their doctor, Canadian health officials said. The symptoms are similar to those of a regular flu: fever, coughing, lack of appetite and energy loss. Some people who have contracted the virus report runny noses, sore throats, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>"This is very concerning, that's why we're paying attention," said Butler-Jones. "What it will lead to is impossible to predict."</p>
<p>There are many unanswered questions about the outbreaks in Mexico and the United States, including whether they are connected to each other or are isolated, and whether this new human swine virus will prompt a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Much more testing and analysis needs to be done, said Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has dispatched a team of experts to Mexico to work with authorities there. In a statement, the agency said the events are of "high concern."</p>
<p>U.S. officials from the Centers for Disease Control said they are working aggressively to get more information about the cases in Mexico and trying to connect the dots between them, two cases in Texas and six in California. The Centers for Disease Control confirmed Friday an eighth case of the illness, a young person from San Diego, who did not require hospitalization.</p>
<p>The disease control centre says it has begun preparation work on a vaccine specific to this strain of human swine flu, the likes of which have never been seen before. It is an influenza A virus, known as H1N1, that is a mixture of swine, human and avian viruses, which the Centers for Disease Control describes as an "unusual" combination.</p>

<p>Gunfights among drug cartels trump the swine flu as the No. 1 risk for British Columbians seeking the Mexican sunshine, the Department of Foreign Affairs suggests.</p>
<p>But the B.C. Centre for Disease Control is asking health-care agencies across the province to monitor patients closely for respiratory illnesses -- particularly among those who've recently returned from Mexico.</p>
<p>Despite reports of up to 60 deaths and more than 1,000 infections centred mostly in the Mexico City area, B.C. travel agents have no obligation to warn travellers about the outbreak, unless the Department of Foreign Affairs issues a warning.</p>
<p>So far in B.C., there have been no suspected cases of severe respiratory illness such as swine flu, although provincial health authorities have "stepped up" their monitoring of respiratory illnesses, according to Roy Wadia, speaking for the centre for disease control.</p>
<p>Likewise, no confirmed cases of the new swine flu have been detected in Canada.</p>
<p>The B.C. centre, which oversees a network of regional public health workers, has advised clinics and health care workers to increase screening and report any unusual illness, especially among travellers returning from Mexico.</p>
<p>Wadia said the Public Health Agency of Canada is in "close talks with their provincial counterparts making sure ports of entry are aware of this situation."</p>
<p>He said the centre for disease control wants to make any B.C. doctor who sees a sign of severe respiratory illness in a patient newly returned from Mexico immediately contacts both the centre and local public health authorities.</p>
<p>There have been no reports of the swine flu at the most popular destinations for British Columbians -- which include Puerto Vallarta, Acapulco, Cancun, Cabo San Lucas and the Mayan Riviera.</p>
<p>Hagen's Travel and Cruises manager Derek Swaile said most of his clients who travel to Mexico City do so not as tourists, but to visit family and friends.</p>
<p>"We're looking at an isolated area, and unless it works its way into the high tourist areas like the coastal sections, it would only be a concern to a small travelling population," said Swaile.</p>
<p>Mexico's health ministry has been good about keeping the industry informed about the crisis, according to Uniglobe Travel Western Canada president Michelle Desreux.</p>
<p>The travel industry is caught between the "wait-and-see" approach of Foreign Affairs and the constant media coverage of the outbreak.</p>
<p>"It's a challenge to provide the facts so we don't end up with people ending their vacation on hearsay," Desreux said.</p>
<p>She advises travellers to buy travel insurance and read the fine print.</p>
<p>"It's important to be clear about what you're buying."</p>
<p>As of Friday, the only caution on the Department of Foreign Affairs website advised Canadians travelling to Mexico to "exercise a high degree of caution due to occasional demonstrations and protests, high levels of criminal activity and violence throughout the country."</p>
<p>"Canadians should be particularly vigilant," it continues, "... particularly when travelling to the cities of Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, as firefights between the military and drug cartels can occur without warning at any time."</p>
<p>Symptoms of the swine flu include the sudden appearance of a high fever, coughing, intense headaches, muscular pain, sore joints, eye irritation and nasal flow.</p>
<p>Travellers are encouraged to prevent infection by washing their hands regularly, staying away from people with respiratory infections, and not greeting people by shaking hands or kissing.</p>
<p>They advise people to stay in well-ventilated, sunlit rooms, and to avoid sharing food, glasses or silverware.</p>

<p>SWINE FLU BASICS</p>
<p>- Usually a pig bug: Swine flu viruses typically sicken pigs, not humans. Most cases occur when people come in contact with infected pigs or contaminated objects moving from people to pigs. The new strain identified in the Mexico outbreak appears to jump easily from human-to-human; few of those who have been sickened had been in contact with pigs.</p>
<p>- This outbreak: Most of the cases and 59 of the deaths were in Mexico City, but three deaths occurred in the central Mexican town of San Louis Potosi and four cases were reported in the Baja peninsula. Genetic testing has so far definitively tied 20 cases to the new flu.</p>
<p>- Flu mutates in pigs: Pigs can catch human and avian or bird flu. When flu viruses from different species infect pigs, they can mix inside the pig and new, mixed viruses can emerge.</p>
<p>- How humans share it: Transmission among humans is thought to occur in the same way as seasonal flu -- by touching something with flu viruses and then touching their mouth or nose, and through coughing or sneezing.</p>
<p>- Symptoms of swine flu: Human symptoms are similar to those of seasonal influenza -- sudden fever, coughing, muscle aches and extreme fatigue. This new strain also appears to cause more diarrhea and vomiting than normal flu.</p>
<p>- No human vaccines: Vaccines are available to be given to pigs to prevent swine influenza. There is no vaccine to protect humans from swine flu although one is being formulating in the U.S. The seasonal influenza vaccine may help provide partial protection against swine H3N2, but not swine H1N1 viruses, like the one circulating now.</p>
<p>- No pork danger: People cannot catch swine flu from eating pork or pork products. Cooking pork to an internal temperature of 160 F (71 C) kills all viruses.</p>

immunity.

<div id="hd"><b>Mexican virus could throw wrench into North America's pandemic planning; Preparations based on assumption outbreak would surface in Asia, and take three months to arrive</b>
</div><div>Ian MacLeod   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>989 words</div><div>25 April 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Based on the law of averages and the science of virology, experts agree another influenza pandemic is inevitable. The question is when.</p>
<p>International public health officials have warned for more than a decade that the world is due for a respiratory disease that will spread to every corner of the globe within months. Millions will become sick and untold numbers will slowly suffocate to death.</p>
<p>In Canada, it has been estimated one-third of the workforce could become ill. And without a ready vaccine, the federal government calculates 11,000 to 58,000 Canadians could die, depending on the virulence of the virus, the rate of infection and the availability of an effective vaccine.</p>
<p>But those dire warnings and grim numbers have been sounded so many times now, the alerts and headlines have taken on a Chicken Little quality, considered by many to be only slightly more credible than tips to the FBI on the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa's gravesite.</p>
<p>If the Mexican virus does, indeed, turn out to be a novel pandemic strain -- and that's still a very big if -- it would throw a wrench into emergency preparations.</p>
<p>Much of North America's pandemic planning is premised on the assumption that a killer virus would emerge in Asia, where all previous pandemic flu viruses have surfaced, and wouldn't arrive here for at least three months. That would allow time to begin preparing a vaccine and detailed plans to inoculate doctors, nurses, police officers, air-traffic controllers, other essential personnel and high-risk groups.</p>
<p>But if Mexico proves to be ground zero, that hoped-for head-start could be lost.</p>
<p>A flu pandemic occurs when a type A influenza virus, originated in birds but which can spread to pigs and then humans, undergoes a sudden and radical mutation called an antigenic shift, and acquires the ability to infect humans. Because people have never been previous exposed to such a germ, no one has immunity. The result is a worldwide epidemic, known as a pandemic.</p>
<p>An average of 25 years separated each pandemic of the 20th century. The range was 11 to 39 years. It has been 41 years since the last pandemic. Statistically speaking, we're overdue.</p>
<p>Like all flu viruses, the one now striking down Mexicans hijacks healthy human cells and uses them to rapidly reproduce new copies of itself. The host cells soon swell and then burst, spewing out armies of new pathogens to invade other healthy cells, particularly the epithelial cells that form the lining of the lungs.</p>
<p>The surface of an influenza virus is covered with hundreds of protruding spikes, each made from one of two proteins: Hemagglutinin (H) allows the virus to bind to the host cells it uses to reproduce itself; neuraminidase (N) helps the new pathogens to pour out of those cells and travel through the bloodstream.</p>
<p>When the virus invades, the immune system produces antibodies that target the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, called antigens, of that particular strain. The antibodies kill the virus and prevent a repeat infection.</p>
<p>To survive, the virus must constantly replicate. But as it does, incremental mutations occur and over time, minor changes appear in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, a process called antigenic drift.</p>
<p>Antibodies on guard against the earlier antigens become less and less effective at recognizing the newer invaders, so that a portion of the world's population is always susceptible to some degree of infection. The result is the annual flu season.</p>
<p>As many as 100 million people in the Northern Hemisphere are infected each year with one of three types of flu virus, usually Type A and Type B, both capable of causing serious disease. Type C influenza is of little public health concern.</p>
<p>Once every generation or so, a type A influenza virus undergoes a sudden, radical mutation. An antigenic shift. Without warning, a novel subtype emerges with a combination of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase to which humans have never been exposed and have no immunity. The result is a pandemic.</p>
<p>The first detailed record of an influenza pandemic was in 1580. Since then, three to four have swept the planet each century.</p>
<p>The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-19 was triggered when a virus to which humans had never been exposed -- called A/H1N1 and a distant relative of the virus now raging in Mexico -- crossed from a bird or pig to a human and then blazed around the globe, killing 20 million to 40 million people, mostly from hemorrhagic viral pneumonia, many within a day or two of being infected. Others were felled by secondary infections such as bacterial pneumonia.</p>
<p>The virus slipped into Canada with the soldiers returning from the Great War in 1918. The virus claimed 440 victims in Ottawa that October. Almost 60 per cent of the victims were 18 to 35 years old. In all, more than 500 people died and thousands became gravely ill during the final four months of the year.</p>
<p>But not all pandemics are apocalyptic. In July 1957, Asian flu (H2N2) arrived in Canada, but the rate of infection didn't explode until the fall of that year, killing 7,000 Canadians. The last pandemic, the 1968 Hong Kong flu (H3N2), caused far more widespread illness than the Asian flu, but was less deadly, killing about 4,000 Canadians. In a normal year, upwards of 1,500 Canadians, mostly older, die from the flu. Hundreds to thousands of others die from flu-related complications.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>If you're heading to Mexico to soak up the sun or clinch a business deal, get your flu shot first.</p>
<p>That's the precautionary message from the local medical officer of health regarding a puzzling outbreak of a severe respiratory illness in Mexico that's led to some deaths among hundreds of ill people.</p>
<p>Influenza season began last fall, but isn't over, Dr. Nicola Mercer of Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health warned yesterday.</p>
<p>"Travellers to Mexico should follow the same precautionary measures that we always recommend when you're travelling in influenza season, which is what is happening right now."</p>
<p>Getting flu shots without knowing how effective they'll be against an unknown dangerous organism, while counterintuitive, is a smart idea, Canada's only disease control centre noted yesterday.</p>
<p>"It's a sound idea," said Roy Wadia, communications director for the British Columbia-based Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Wadia said a flu shot will boost a person's immune system, so it should help, even if it isn't an exact match for the pathogen at the heart of the Mexican outbreak.</p>
<p>"You could get some cross-protection," Wadia said.</p>
<p>A flu shot remains timely because Mexico is experiencing an extended flu season, Mercer said.</p>
<p>But even back home the season can extend into June, as it did last year, she added.</p>
<p>Local vaccine supplies are down from the start of the season last fall but still available, Mercer said.</p>
<p>Mercer said those travelling south should wash their hands frequently and cover coughs and sneezes. Travellers who feel ill upon return should seek medical help. Local physicians have been warned to be on the lookout for flu-like symptoms, Mercer said.</p>
<p>She cautioned, however, there's no evidence yet that the outbreak in Mexico is flu, which is why she and health investigators are calling it "severe respiratory illness," even though symptoms are flu-like.</p>
<p>Health authorities in the U.S., Mexico and Canada are also trying to determine if the Mexican outbreak is related to seven recent known cases of flu in California and Texas.</p>
<p>Influenza is a form of swine flu that jumps the interspecies barrier to humans and birds. The term for such adept organisms is zoonoses. Food-borne zoonoses are the focus of a federal laboratory in Guelph.</p>
<p>The most famous swine flu outbreak was the 1918 pandemic that struck as soldiers returned to their families at the end of the First World War. It claimed the lives of 600,000 people. If the new illness proves to be swine flu, it would be the first international outbreak since 1968's Hong Kong flu.</p>
<p>Among health authorities investigating the latest threat is a federal lab in Winnipeg, which is working with samples of organisms from the Mexican outbreak.</p>

<p>Canada's chief public health officer says there's no reason Canadians shouldn't travel to Mexico in the wake of positive swine flu cases being identified in the country.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones says Canada has not issued a travel advisory telling Canadians to stay away from Mexico, and neither has the United States.</p>
<p>There have been no human cases of swine flu in Canada, Butler-Jones said yesterday.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- Canada's chief public health officer expressed deep concern about a swine influenza outbreak gripping Mexico and the southwestern United States as health officials around the world went on high alert for a potential global flu pandemic.</p>
<p>“This is very concerning, clearly. That's why we're all paying attention,” David Butler-Jones said yesterday. “What it will lead to is impossible to predict.”</p>
<p>Mexico shut down schools, museums and libraries in its capital yesterday in the hope of containing a never-before-seen virus that authorities say has killed 20 people – and perhaps dozens more. Hundreds in the country are suffering from a severe respiratory illness.</p>
<p>The virus has not landed in Canada yet, but health officials are awaiting lab results from a Crown attorney in Cornwall, Ont., who returned from Mexico last month with a mysterious illness.</p>
<p>Mexico confirmed that some of the respiratory illnesses were caused by a new swine flu virus similar to the one that has sickened eight people in Texas and California.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization started convening an expert panel to advise it about raising the pandemic alert level, which is currently at level 3 (none or very limited human-to-human transmission) in its six-rung alert ladder. One health expert expects things to move quickly in the coming days.</p>
<p>“In my mind, what we're talking about is moving from a pandemic alert 3 to a pandemic alert probably 5,” said Michael Gardam, director of infectious diseases prevention and control at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion. Level 5 indicates a new strain with significant human-to-human transmission. Level 6 is a pandemic.</p>
<p>“They're going to need a bit of time to digest it, I understand that. That being said, being very familiar with their plans and their phases, I am assuming they will come to the conclusion once they've gone through that deliberation that they need to up the pandemic threat level.”</p>
<p>The unusual influenza A H1N1 swine virus was first reported earlier this week, when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced it had found cases with the virus.</p>
<p>Mexico sent samples of its influenza virus to be tested at the CDC and the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. Both labs found positives of swine flu.</p>
<p>Testing indicates the virus shows sensitivity to Tamiflu and Relenza, the two anti-viral drugs that Canada has stockpiled.</p>
<p>Dr. Butler-Jones said those who have returned from Mexico within the past two weeks and are experiencing flu-like symptoms should see their doctor.</p>
<p>He said a handful of flu cases have been looked at across the country, but so far none have come back positive.</p>
<p>Blood specimens from Cornwall lawyer Guy Simard, 47, are being tested for the virus. Health officials say Mr. Simard has since recovered.</p>
<p>There is no reason Canadians shouldn't travel to Mexico, as long as the usual travel precautions are taken, Dr. Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>Dr. Gardam disagreed.</p>
<p>“My own personal opinion would be that if I was planning a trip right now and I was hearing that Mexico had just closed their schools because they're worried about transmission of a novel flu virus, I would probably rethink my travel plans,” he said.</p>
<p>In Mexico, Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova said 68 people have died of flu since March 18, and the new swine flu strain had been confirmed in 20 of those deaths.</p>
<p>At least 1,004 people nationwide were sick from the suspected flu, he said.</p>
<p>The cases have mainly affected healthy young adults between the ages of 25 and 44.</p>
<p>Mexican authorities said this could be because immunizations are given to children and the elderly, the highest risk groups.</p>
<p>It is believed that the new swine influenza spreads the same way as the seasonal flu and has similar symptoms, including fever and joint aches.</p>
<p>Richard Besser, acting director at the CDC, said in a news teleconference that he's heard high anxiety from the public.</p>
<p>“We are worried as well,” Dr. Besser said.</p>
<p>The eight people in Texas and California have all recovered, although it remains unclear how they contacted the virus.</p>
<p>Scientists have long been preparing for a new flu virus that could cause a global pandemic.</p>
<p>The focus has been on the bird flu in Southeast Asia, but the virus there has not spread from person to person easily enough to touch off a pandemic.</p>
<p>Canada was among the first to start preparations for a pandemic, Dr. Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>He added that officials have built an anti-viral stockpile and have the ability to produce a vaccine quickly for the whole country.</p>
<p>PAST PANDEMICS</p>
<p>A pandemic is a worldwide outbreak of a new disease that spreads quickly and against which people have little immunity. There have been three flu pandemics in the past century and experts say another could come at any time.</p>
<p>A strain of the swine flu caused the great pandemic of 1918-19 that killed 50- million people. Called the Spanish flu, the infection primarily struck young adults and is considered one of deadliest disease events in human history.</p>
<p>The 1957 Asian flu and the 1968 Hong Kong flu – both caused by strains of the avian flu – were considered less severe pandemics. They killed two-million and one-million people, respectively.</p>
<p>Another pandemic was predicted in 1976 when a strain of the swine flu was found among U.S. Army recruits at Fort Dix in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The United States reacted with a massive immunization campaign, inoculating 60-million people before the vaccine was recalled. Canada had already ordered three-million doses of the vaccine, which was blamed for killing 25 people in the United States and causing paralysis in others.</p>
<p>The pandemic did not break out as expected.</p>
<p>Nicki Thomas</p>
<p>PREPAREDNESS PLAN</p>
<p>WHO uses a six-phase series of alerts to inform the world of the seriousness of the threat.</p>

<p>What is swine flu?</p>
<p>Swine flu is a respiratory illness caused by a type A influenza virus, usually of the subtype H1N1, that triggers outbreaks in pigs fairly regularly. It can also be transferred from pigs to humans, from humans to pigs, and from humans to other humans.</p>
<p>Four main virus subtypes - H1N1, H1N2, H3N2 and H3N1 - have been isolated in pigs, though the virus, like all influenza viruses, constantly mutates. When influenza viruses from different species infect pigs, the viruses can trade genes to create new versions that mix swine, human and/or avian influenza.</p>
<p>The swine H1N1 virus is not the same as the human H1N1 virus, so vaccines for the latter won't protect from the former.</p>
<p>Can humans catch swine flu?</p>
<p>Yes, but it is not common. Usually, this happens to people who are in contact with pigs, though there are some documented cases of human-to-human transfer. Human-to-human transmission is believed to occur much like the regular flu, through coughing, sneezing and other contact. Eating pork does not transmit the virus. The symptoms resemble those of the regular flu virus.</p>
<p>How can swine flu be diagnosed and treated?</p>
<p>Diagnosing requires a respiratory specimen taken during the first four or five days of infection, to be analyzed in a lab. The virus seems to respond to antiviral drugs, including those Canadian health authorities have been stockpiling in case of a flu pandemic.</p>
<p>When has it happened before?</p>
<p>The best-known case of swine flu is a 1976 outbreak at an army barracks in Fort Dix, N.J., which sickened four soldiers and killed one. There have been no major outbreaks of swine flu recorded in Canada.</p>
<p>How is swine flu H1N1 virus</p>
<p>different from SARS and avian flu H5N1 virus?</p>
<p>All three come from animals, but SARS, a corona virus, and the avian flu are poorly adapted to infecting humans. As a result, it is fairly difficult for humans to catch either virus or pass them on to others, though the effects can prove deadly when infection occurs.</p>

<p>The Saskatchewan Ministry of Health and public health officials across the province are keeping a wary eye on a severe respiratory virus outbreak -- linked to a new strain of swine influenza -- in Mexico and the southern United States.</p>
<p>As a precaution, Saskatchewan public health is closely monitoring the situation and physicians in the province have been notified to ask patients with influenza symptoms about their travel history, said Dr. Moira McKinnon, Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer.</p>
<p>If patients confirm that they have travelled to Mexico in the last 10 days, doctors are being advised to contact public health so that those cases can be investigated further.</p>
<p>"There is still a significant amount of regular seasonal influenza circulating in parts of Mexico so even if you have returned with the flu, you don't need to be alarmed,'' McKinnon said.</p>
<p>"However, because we want to be vigilant in our monitoring process, we would ask that anyone who has returned from Mexico and becomes ill -- experiencing coughing, shortness of breath, high temperatures, and tiredness -- to contact their medical professional.''</p>
<p>McKinnon reminded residents that the best way to reduce the spread of influenza is to adopt the standard infection control practices such as frequent handwashing, coughing and sneezing into the elbow rather than the hands, staying at least a metre away from anyone who is coughing and obviously ill, avoiding large crowds and staying home if ill.</p>
<p>As for issuing a travel advisory to certain areas of Mexico, she said the ministry of health is waiting for advice from the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States.</p>
<p>"The World Health Organization is concerned that this is a new virus and it may spread so every country will be on the same alert as Canada is and almost every country will be looking for cases associated with Mexico and associated with this new virus,'' McKinnon said.</p>
<p>"At the moment the WHO and CDC are looking at the risk levels and considering what sorts of alerts should be put out globally. We are saying just to be very careful and to keep in communications with the health profession.''</p>
<p>On Friday WHO authorities reported seven confirmed cases of Swine Influenza A/H1N1 in California and Texas and nine suspected cases. All seven confirmed cases in the United States had mild influenza-like illness with only one requiring brief hospitalization.</p>
<p>In Mexico there are three clusters of swine flu or influenza-like viruses -- in and around Mexico City, in San Luis Postosi in central Mexico and in Mexicali, near the border with the United States.</p>
<p>The latest report coming out of Mexico is of 800 severe cases with 58 confirmed deaths.</p>
<p>The swine flu viruses characterized in this outbreak are a new strain not previously detected in pigs or humans, according to a WHO news release posted on its website.</p>
<p>McKinnon said Saskatchewan is working closely with the public health agency to monitor the situation on a daily basis.</p>
<p>"As the situation evolves over the next few days we will be looking possibly at (taking) actions depending on how this outbreak spreads and how it develops,'' she said, referring to posting public health notices at the airport and issuing travel advisories.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Public health units, quarantine officers and medical practitioners across the country have been warned to be on guard for cases of a mystery illness in Canadians returning from Mexico.</p>
<p>The warning follows reports from that country of cases of severe respiratory illness, which in some cases has led to death.</p>
<p>Mexican authorities have insisted the outbreak is not an epidemic and that preventive measures are being taken to reduce the risk of transmission of disease.</p>
<p>Mexican authorities informed Canadian counterparts about the situation on April 17, asking for help with their investigation. Scientists at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg are assisting in efforts to determine the cause or causes of the illnesses.</p>
<p>"We are aware of the reports and are looking into them,'' said Andrew McDermott, a spokesperson for the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>It's not clear if there is any link between the illnesses and the recent discovery of several human cases of swine flu infection in California.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King, who is the Public Health Agency of Canada's point person for pandemic preparedness, said samples from Mexico will need to be studied to see if there is any link. She said it is important to be on the lookout for new infectious disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>"We absolutely have to remain vigilant in the country around the situation in Mexico and globally,'' said King. "We need to be prepared for any emerging infectious disease threat that may occur outside of our borders.''</p>
<p>Donna Eberwine-Villagran, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization's Americas branch, the Pan American Health Organization, said her agency is also working with authorities in Mexico and on the U.S. border.</p>
<p>The illnesses are said to have been in south and central Mexico and involve mainly young, previously healthy adults. Some reports have suggested health-care workers have become ill.</p>
<p>To date, two clusters of severe respiratory infections with death have been reported in April, one in Mexico City and one in San Luis Potosí. Mexico City has reported 120 cases including 13 deaths while San Luis Potosí, in central Mexico, has reported 14 cases including four deaths.</p>
<p>In addition there has been a death reported in Oaxaca, in southern Mexico and two deaths reported in Baja California Norte, which borders California.</p>
<p>Health authorities have been told some cases have tested positive for influenza, but some are influenza A and others are influenza B.</p>
<p>A leading infectious diseases expert said a number of pathogens could be the culprit or culprits. "It could be anything,'' said Dr. Allison McGeer of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital. "Full range from new and unidentified virus to stuff that goes on every day and somebody just did a test.''</p>
<p>She added that it was "improbable'' that the illness was being caused by anything exotic and was most likely the work of influenza or an adenovirus.</p>
<p>An advisory from Toronto Public Health to health professionals said that given the severity of the illness, health care workers should be looking for cases of severe respiratory infection in people who have been in Mexico in the previous two weeks. But the advisory stressed that there is no evidence the infections are caused by an unusual pathogen or a novel flu strain.</p>
<p>Mexican health officials held a news conference Wednesday to discuss the situation, putting the surge in illnesses down to end-of-season flu activity.</p>

<p>Manitoba hospitals are on the lookout for severely ill patients returning from Mexico, as international pandemic officials investigate an outbreak of an unidentified respiratory illness that has killed at least a dozen people.</p>
<p>Dr. Joel Kettner, chief medical officer, said Thursday the province was alerted to a cluster of cases of severe respiratory illness in Mexico from Canada's integrated outbreak surveillance system on Monday. The cause of the illness is unknown and Kettner said scientists from Winnipeg-based National Microbiology Lab are helping investigate the potentially infectious disease that has struck adults between the age of 25 and 44 in south and central Mexico.</p>
<p>To date, two clusters of severe respiratory infections with death have been reported in April -- one in Mexico City and one in San Luis Potosi. Mexico City has reported 120 cases, including 13 deaths, while San Luis Potosi, in central Mexico, has reported 14 cases, including four deaths.</p>
<p>One death has been reported in Oaxaca in southern Mexico and two deaths reported in Baja California Norte, which borders California. Health authorities have been told some of the cases have tested positive for influenza -- some cases are influenza A and others are influenza B.</p>
<p>Kettner said hospitals across the province have been put on alert to watch for patients who are seriously ill with flu-like symptoms. Suspect patients will be put in isolation and health-care workers will follow proper outbreak precautions, including wearing gloves and masks.</p>
<p>It's still unclear whether the illness is transmitted from person to person, but Kettner said hospitals will remain vigilant since it's possible Manitobans who visited Mexico have been exposed.</p>
<p>"The big concern is that this is just the beginning of something that's more serious," Kettner said.</p>
<p>Mexican authorities have insisted the outbreak is not an epidemic and that preventive measures are being taken to reduce the risk of transmission.</p>
<p>Dr. Ricardo Lobato de Faria, acting head of Winnipeg's emergency medicine program, said triage nurses and doctors have been warned to look for younger patients who are severely ill. He said minor coughs, colds, and flu-like symptoms are not what they're looking for. Health-care workers will flag as an immediate concern anyone with an undiagnosed severe illness.</p>
<p>Lobato de Faria doubts Winnipeg will see any cases linked to the outbreak since the bulk of Manitobans' winter travel to Mexico is tapering off.</p>
<p>"These are patients that are very ill way beyond what we expect," he said. "If you think of a person with a severe case of the flu that need hospitalizations, further interventions, that's what we're really looking for..."</p>
<p>There is no travel advisory warning against visiting Mexico, and medical experts say anyone planning a trip should take common-sense precautions.</p>
<p>Dr. Pierre Plourde, Winnipeg Regional Health Authority medical officer of health, said travellers can help prevent respiratory illnesses by washing their hands and using hand sanitizer. He said Winnipeggers can avoid getting sick or spreading disease by coughing and sneezing into the crook of their arm.</p>
<p>"There's not a lot you can do other than the etiquette we talk about normally, so washing your hands frequently is a good idea."</p>
<p>It's not clear if there is any link between these illnesses and the recent discovery of several human cases of swine flu infection in California.</p>
<p>Mexican authorities informed Canada about the situation on April 17.</p>

</p>
<p>U.S. public health authorities are investigating two cases of swine flu in unrelated children in California.</p>
<p>Discovery of the two cases, in children who apparently had no contact with pigs or with each other, is raising questions about whether swine flu viruses are circulating there, officials of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said yesterday.</p>
<p>A boy, 10, and a girl, 9, both became ill at the end of March. Testing revealed that both had been infected with H1N1 viruses from swine. Both have since recovered.</p>
<p>The viruses have unusual properties never seen before in swine flu viruses, the CDC said. Two of the genes of the viruses were from swine viruses that normally circulate in Eurasia, a finding that has added to the level of interest and concern.</p>
<p>CDC officials said they had alerted the World Health Organization as required.</p>
<p>A senior official of the WHO said there is no need at this point to raise the global pandemic alert level.</p>

<p>Winter is almost over, and it appears that we're going to make it through another flu season without a global disaster.</p>
<p>That may seem like a miracle after the hysteria generated in recent years by SARS, avian flu and the World Health Organization's standing warning that it's "a matter of time" before the next influenza pandemic strikes. But the truth is that the threat is being hyped.</p>
<p>- Infectious diseases are spreading faster than ever.</p>
<p>The WHO made this claim in a 2007 report. But even before the advent of commercial air travel, diseases had no trouble moving from place to place. Germs do fly, but outbreaks don't go global that much more readily than they did before. And we can handle most of them by monitoring infectious people and distributing medicine quickly.</p>
<p>- To learn how to prevent a pandemic, look to the past.</p>
<p>The worst calamities erupt precisely because they are unprecedented and unimaginable. The influenza of 1918 was unlike any before or since. Then came yet another unheard-of illness: AIDS. The next killer will be one that we've never imagined.</p>
<p>- We should brace for another Spanish flu.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we'll never see another flu outbreak of that sort. During the First World War the movement of troops and refugees created a unique breeding ground for the virus and probably allowed more virulent strains to develop.</p>
<p>- The annual flu season is nothing compared to a pandemic.</p>
<p>Preparedness warriors try to frighten people by using the word "pandemic." But such strains of the influenza virus aren't necessarily more virulent than the ordinary ones we see each winter. Only two flu pandemics have occurred since 1918. In both cases, global mortality was a fraction of what it was in 1918. A recent study showed the number of deaths directly attributable to influenza during the two pandemics was no higher than during typical flu seasons.</p>
<p>- There's no such thing as being too prepared.</p>
<p>Actually, we run the risk of doing more harm than good by overreacting to the threat of a pandemic. In 1976, swine flu, a strain of influenza similar to that of 1918, was diagnosed in a small number of soldiers at Fort Dix, N.J., one of whom died. That prompted medical experts to warn the U.S. faced a crisis reminiscent of the Spanish flu. A mass inoculation program was authorized.</p>
<p>But the plan crashed. A disorder called Guillain-Barre Syndrome, which causes the immune system to attack the body's nerves, began appearing in patients who had received the flu shots. About 500 cases were linked to the vaccine; 32 of whom died.</p>

<div>THE CANADIAN PRESS</div>
<div>394 words</div><div>23 February 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A09</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>American scientists have found human antibodies that kill a broad range of influenza A viruses, a discovery that raises hopes of both better flu drugs and a more effective, longer lasting flu shot.</p>
<p>The discovery of monoclonal antibodies that target what some researchers believe may be flu's Achilles heel suggests medicine finally may be able to find a way to neutralize influenza's maddening ability to evade the immune system through constant mutation.</p>
<p>The wily viral trick of continually altering external appearance is why people do not develop lifelong immunity after catching the flu and why flu shots have to be reformulated almost annually to keep pace.</p>
<p>"I certainly believe a pan therapy for influenza may be within our grasp," one of the authors, Dr. Robert Liddington, said of the findings, published yesterday in the journal, Nature Structural and Molecular Biology.</p>
<p>Preliminary results have been promising. The monoclonal antibodies protected mice against what should have been lethal doses of several variants of avian H5N1 and human H1N1 flu viruses. Later this year, their protective potential will be tested in ferrets, which are believed to be the best animal model for flu.</p>
<p>The work was done by researchers from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, the Burnham Institute for Medical Research in La Jolla, Calif., and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, with funding from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>The monoclonal antibodies have been patented. Dr. Wayne Marasco, of the Dana-Farber institute, said the group will seek a pharmaceutical partner with which to begin human clinical trials.</p>
<p>Liddington, director of the infectious diseases program of Burnham Institute, said a near-term prospect could be a drug that is given to prevent infection or as a treatment to cut illness short after infection. Such an injection, would be useful in the early days of a flu pandemic, when pandemic vaccine is not yet ready. Because these antibodies kill a range of influenza A viruses, they could be stockpiled by countries to protect critical workers in the early days of a pandemic, regardless of the strain that triggered the outbreak, he said.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>It appears there may be a partial flu shot mismatch again this year, with early data from Canada, the United States and Britain suggesting the vaccine component meant to protect against influenza B is not a match for the flu B viruses causing the most disease.</p>
<p>Predicting which family of influenza B viruses will dominate in a coming year -- and therefore should be covered by the flu shot -- is a challenge that has defied the experts in five of the last seven flu seasons, at least so far as disease patterns in North America are concerned.</p>
<p>The ongoing problem has prompted exploration of the idea that flu shots should be reformulated to add a second B component to a vaccine that currently protects against one family of B viruses and the two influenza A subtypes, H3N2 and H1N1.</p>
<p>Scientists from the U.S. Centers of Disease Control are working on a cost-benefit analysis of just such a move and were to meet yesterday to begin going over the pros and cons. They plan to present their findings sometime next month to the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates vaccines in the United States.</p>
<p>"Historically it's obviously been difficult to predict which one's coming next,'' Dr. Joseph Bresee, the CDC's chief of influenza surveillance and prevention, says of the flu B viruses.</p>
<p>"And so one way to hedge those bets is just put them both in the vaccine.''</p>
<p>Whether vaccine manufacturers would welcome the added task is unclear. Because influenza viruses mutate so rapidly, flu shots are reformulated almost every year. Manufacturers could argue that adding a fourth component to an already complex task might cause more problems than it fixes.</p>
<p>Bresee admits the CDC analysis suggests the answer isn't clear cut. "If you look at it, it's more complicated than you'd think.''</p>
<p>Until about eight years ago, only one family or lineage of B viruses circulated globally at one time. But in 2001 a second emerged from Asia and the two -- known as B/Yamagata and B/Victoria -- have co-circulated since. Each year one or the other has been dominant, though there is no clear pattern of how or when they alternate.</p>
<p>Because the viruses are from distinct lineages, it is thought a vaccine made to protect against viruses from one would offer little or no protection against viruses from the other. However, ongoing Canadian vaccine effectiveness studies show that isn't always the case.</p>
<p>"All is not lost if there is that lineage level mismatch, because in the seasons that we have monitored it, we have -- at least so far -- shown that there has been some cross protection,'' says Dr. Danuta Skowronski, a flu expert with the British Columbia Center for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Some years that cross protection can be reasonably high, though Skowronski admits other years mismatched B vaccine appears to offer little protection to the people who get it.</p>
<p>This year's flu vaccine was designed to protect against B/Yamagata viruses. But in Canada, the U.S. and Britain so far this season, B/Victoria viruses have been responsible for a majority of confirmed flu B cases. It is still early in the season, though, and patterns could still change.</p>
<p>"I think it's way too early to tell,'' says Bresee when asked if the B component of the vaccine is mismatched.</p>
<p>Even if there is a mismatch, it may not matter too much in the U.S. and Britain.</p>
<p>H3N2 viruses have dominated in Britain's raging flu season; flu B has been a bit player there so far. And in the U.S., H1N1 viruses have to date been the major source of disease.</p>
<p>The H3N2 and H1N1 components of this year's flu shot are well matched to circulating viruses.</p>
<p>But in Canada, where flu activity is just starting to pick up, B viruses have made up the bulk of confirmed cases so far -- making a vaccine mismatch potentially more problematic here.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Resistant viruses complicate treatment of flu</b>
</div><div>Helen Branswell   </div>

<div>457 words</div><div>20 December 2008</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>D10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2008 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Early signs from this flu season suggest doctors face a vexing dilemma in treating the illness.</p>
<p>Testing to date in Canada, the United States and Europe shows that nearly all H1N1 viruses are resistant to oseltamivir (sold as Tamiflu) and susceptible to the adamantane drugs, amantadine and rimantadine.</p>
<p>The inverse is true for H3N2 viruses, which are universally resistant to the adamantanes and susceptible to oseltamivir.</p>
<p>Given that in reality little point-of-care testing is done to determine whether a patient actually has influenza, let alone which variety of the bug is behind the illness, the resistance situation could see doctors making choices that lead to treatment failure this season.</p>
<p>"This is a very challenging situation,'' Dr. Tim Uyeki, deputy chief of influenza surveillance and prevention for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control admitted about the bizarre resistance picture coming into focus in the early days of the flu season.</p>
<p>"It definitely adds to the complexity of trying to manage influenza,'' Dr. Maria Zambon, head of the respiratory viruses unit of Britain's Health Protection Agency, agreed in an interview.</p>
<p>In the face of these early results, the Center for Disease Control issued a health alert yesterday to bring the U.S. medical community up to speed and recommend changes in the usage of flu drugs for the time being.</p>
<p>The upshot? When in doubt -- and when the patient's age and health permits -- use the only other option, the drug zanamivir, which is sold under the brand name Relenza.</p>
<p>So far, all influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2 are subtypes of influenza A) as well as influenza B viruses seem to be susceptible to zanamivir.</p>
<p>Oseltamivir could be used in combination with one of the adamantane drugs, but should only be used alone when local surveillance shows the viruses circulating are likely to be H3N2 or influenza B, the centre says.</p>
<p>As U.S. surveillance suggests most disease there so far this season is being caused by the H1N1 viruses, zanamivir appears to be a better bet than oseltamivir -- or at least it is for patients who can use it. Zanamivir isn't licensed for use in children under seven years of age, and can't be used by people with chronic underlying airways disease or who can't manage the drug's inhalation device.</p>
<p>While they struggle to craft guidance for doctors, both the Center for Disease Control and the Public Health Agency of Canada have a straightforward piece of advice for the public: Get a flu shot. This year's vaccine is well matched to the H1N1 viruses and the majority of H3N2 viruses currently making the rounds.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Have youheard? Interest in singles has once again revived a 'dead' music medium, the seven-inch vinyl record</b>
</div><div>Ben Rayner   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>790 words</div><div>11 December 2008</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>E01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2008 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>The seven-inch single is pretty much the inverse of the MP3 file.</p>
<p>Physical, inconsistent, mortal and definitely not portable in the post-Walkman sense of the word, the beloved, wee black discs upon which rock 'n' roll was born should by all rights have been dealt a final death blow by the arrival of digital music files.</p>
<p>Curiously, though, sales of 45s - a format introduced by RCA in 1951 - are on the rise. Especially in the U.K., where they've inched back up to more than 15 per cent of the total singles market and the White Stripes' "Icky Thump" last year posted the highest single-week sales of a seven-inch in 20 years.</p>
<p>Most of the activity in mainstream circles is overseas, mind you, where the major record labels never used the advent of the compact disc as an excuse to kill off their singles market altogether and force the record-buying public onto full-length CDs. Since the rise of Napster and, later, iTunes, however, a market for single songs has been reborn, and one of the unintended benefactors has been the seven-inch. Sub Pop Records' famous "single of the month" club has been reactivated. Toronto has its own label dealing just in seven-inches, Davy Love's Magnificent Sevens imprint. And with more seven-inches out there making the rounds, more musicians have started thinking in terms of singles again.</p>
<p>Toronto country troupe One Hundred Dollars, for instance, fetes the release of its "Fourteenth Floor" seven-inch for local label Blocks Recording Club tomorrow at the Silver Dollar. It's the first in a series of singles to be issued by different labels around the country.</p>
<p>"We had initially conceived it as a takeoff on Gordon Lightfoot's 'Railroad Trilogy,' but the format was too small to do three songs," laughs vocalist Simone Schmidt. "We thought it would be more interesting to leave it open-ended and use the seven-inches to record interesting singles and B-sides - things that we wouldn't necessarily want to put on an album.</p>
<p>"It's all new and it's all thematically linked to where the label is. So for the label in Alberta, we're recording a song called 'Black Gold' that's about Fort McMurray and the oil sands. ... It's interesting to have that kind of challenge in the concept when you're writing."</p>
<p>The creative possibilities offered by the 45, not its marketability, are what have sustained the format through all these years when it was supposed to be dead.</p>
<p>"I personally love them," says Oliver Ackermann of New York noise-rock outfit A Place to Bury Strangers, which recently issued a volley of seven-inches on Important Records. "When you create a seven-inch, it's an opportunity to do something unique that doesn't fit for an album. The tracks are also immediate; there is no filler. A single is a glimpse of a moment and an experience and an idea."</p>
<p>They're also highly collectible. The punk and indie-rock undergrounds have always been particularly fond of the seven-inch as a badge of fanhood, something doled out in limited quantities and often specific circumstances - on certain tour dates or on labels available only in a certain region.</p>
<p>Bands like No Age and Toronto's F -ed Up are almost legendary these days for the volume of material they churn out on hard-to-find seven-inches.</p>
<p>"Seven-inches are like little flags for the fan," says Joel Carriere of Toronto's Dine Alone Records. "It's a conversation to relate and compare."</p>
<p>As a result, says Carriere, "it's a lot more fun for us to work on it because we are getting rad pieces of history to fans ... Vinyls are not going to float a record company by any means, but they will put a smile on some fans' faces and in the end that's all you really want to do."</p>
<p>Evaporators lead singer Nardwuar the Human Serviette - such a fan of "dead" formats that you can still get Evaporators albums on eight-track cassette - finds the artwork possibilities of the 45 attractive, conceding that the actual sound of the recording is almost secondary to the package itself.</p>
<p>He recalls with no small fondness, for instance, an old Tumor Circus seven-inch titled "Swine Flu" that came out during the 1990s. Each copy had a hole drilled through it, rendering it impossible to play.</p>
<p>"They're like pet rocks," he says. "People just want to collect them."</p>

<p>In 15th-century Italy, people suffering from congestion, fevers and aches blamed the "influence" of the stars. They named their affliction "influenza."</p>
<p>Today, medical researchers know the virus has nothing to do with the Big Dipper.</p>
<p>So here are some facts you can rely on about the flu virus:</p>
<p>It's typically most brutal on the elderly and infants.</p>
<p>In 1918, it surprised the world and caused at least 50 million deaths. Paradoxically, roughly half of those who died were young men and women in their prime.</p>
<p>It changes - often year to year, sometimes within a season.</p>
<p>The names scientists assign to its various strains reflect its nature and history. For instance, this season's recommended flu vaccine includes A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like virus; A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)-like virus; and B/Florida/4/2006-like virus. The place name indicates the jurisdiction of the lab where the virus was isolated. The first number specifies its place in the sequence of viruses isolated in a given year. The next number is the year it was isolated. As for A or B, there are three types of flu virus: A H1N1, AH3N2, and B. The "-like virus" means manufacturers aren't limited to using that exact strain. If they find one with very similar characteristics that grows better in their hands, they're free to use that.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>There's no denying it: The reputation of the flu shot has taken a bit of a beating over the past year.</p>
<p>So as flu season approaches and flu clinics open their doors, you may be wondering whether getting a shot is worth the effort, momentary discomfort and expense, if you are one of those folks for whom the vaccine isn't provided for free.</p>
<p>After all, two of the three strains in last year's vaccine did not offer terrific protection against the viruses that were actually making people sick. And a heated scientific debate over methods used to calculate how many seniors' lives are saved by flu shots seems to be coming to the conclusion that their life-saving effect in that group has been somewhat overestimated.</p>
<p>With the media attention these issues have received, some influenza experts suspect members of the public may be harbouring doubts about the value of rolling up a sleeve for a flu shot.</p>
<p>"Yeah, absolutely. I think that's true,'' says Dr. David Shay, a vaccine expert in the influenza division of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Ga.</p>
<p>Shay and other public health authorities still insist that flu shots are an important contribution to the fight against influenza, which makes millions of people seriously ill and is thought to kill between 250,000 and 500,000 people around the globe every year.</p>
<p>"The bottom line, I think, is that this vaccine is still the best protection that we have against circulating (flu) virus,'' says Dr. Danuta Skowronski, an influenza expert with the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver.</p>
<p>But no one in public health would argue that flu shots throw up an impermeable shield. The combination of some challenging features of influenza's makeup, plus the state of the science of flu shot production means some years the vaccine performs better than others.</p>
<p>And basic biological facts -- the immune system takes awhile to build up in early childhood, wanes as we head into later life and is weakened by conditions like HIV and heart disease -- mean that flu shots offer the least protection to those typically hit hardest by influenza.</p>
<p>"It's clear that (flu) vaccines do not work optimally under all conditions and in all age groups. This is just incontrovertible,'' says Dr. Keiji Fukuda, head of the World Health Organization's global influenza program.</p>
<p>"And I think that one of the big scientific challenges for influenza . . . is how do you take things like vaccines and make them a lot more effective for the groups of people that are most vulnerable? I think it's clear that we don't have vaccines right now that are optimal for the elderly. We don't have vaccines which are optimal for children less than six months.''</p>
<p>Research is underway in laboratories around the world aimed at improving flu vaccines.</p>
<p>The holy grail of this work is a flu shot that could protect against all subtypes of influenza. If that goal is reached, flu shots might be among the vaccines kids get in early childhood, offering years or even a lifetime of protection. But such a flu shot is not imminent.</p>
<p>For now we have vaccines the experts acknowledge don't work optimally. But there's a lot of ground between optimal and useless and most of the time flu vaccine is closer to the former's point on the spectrum. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says that in 16 of the last 20 flu seasons, the strains in the vaccine have been well matched to those causing disease.</p>
<p>So if you get a shot and if you have a strong immune system and if the strains in the shot are well matched to the viruses causing disease, most years you will likely evade influenza's grasp. And even if a flu shot doesn't prevent you from catching the flu, the antibodies generated could make the difference between a prolonged bout of bed rest and a couple of days off work.</p>
<p>"At the end of the day what we're really trying to do is make sure people get harmed as little as possible,'' Fukuda says. "That's definitely trying to prevent deaths. But it's also trying to keep people out of hospitals, it's trying to keep people from developing serious complications.''</p>
<p>Protecting people against the flu is a complex task. And expecting that the same shot will offer equal and optimal protection to people of varying ages and health status in Fort McMurray, Fort Worth and Frankfurt in any given winter is asking a lot of one vaccine.</p>
<p>The problem is there isn't one static target, one type of flu virus that the vaccine can teach your immune system to be on guard against.</p>
<p>In fact, the vaccine is three shots in one, protecting against one influenza B virus and two influenza A viruses (of the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes) that were predicted -- months earlier -- to be the major causes of disease for that flu season.</p>
<p>Sometimes those predictions aren't entirely on the money. Because it takes roughly six months to make, bottle and distribute flu vaccine, scientists have to choose next year's flu shot strains before this year's flu season is over. The strains covered in the 2008-09 season's vaccine were selected at a World Health Organization meeting last February, based on transmission patterns then.</p>
<p>But flu viruses mutate constantly, so while the vaccine was being made, the target kept moving. These constant changes explain why we can catch the flu multiple times in our lives. But they also can undermine the effectiveness of the vaccine. The more the viruses causing disease evolve away from those in the vaccine, the less protection the vaccine can offer.</p>
<p>In addition to being ever-changing, the spread of flu viruses is pretty unpredictable. So the viruses that are wreaking havoc in Ottawa in the third week of January may not be the same as those causing misery in Oklahoma City. But the same flu shot is being asked to protect folks in both locations and many more.</p>
<p>The regional variability in viruses -- some of which are better matched to the vaccine than others -- explains why some years some parts of the country or the continent or the hemisphere will be walloped by flu, while other communities will experience less disease.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last flu season parts of the U.S. were being hit by H3N2 viruses (moderately matched to the vaccine strain) while many parts of Canada were being attacked by influenza B viruses.</p>
<p>Because the B strain in the 2007-08 vaccine was a poor match for the circulating viruses, lots of Canadians fell ill at the end of last winter and in the early spring. But earlier in the flu season when H1N1 viruses were making the rounds in both countries, people who had received a flu shot had good protection; the H1N1 component of last year's flu shot was a good match for circulating viruses.</p>
<p>It just goes to show that the flu shot is trying to help people who get it dodge three bullets. Depending on the flu season and which viruses are circulating where you live, you could be in the line of fire for one, two, or all three over the course of the flu season.</p>
<p>"I think people need to know that it's very context-dependent and you can't predict that context going into the (flu) season,'' Skowronski says.</p>
<p>"The bottom line is, though, that you're going to get protection. . . . Even if you have suboptimal protection to one component, to another component it may be quite excellent.''</p>
