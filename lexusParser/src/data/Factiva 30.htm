<p>The giant lineups and frustration that dominated the first week of the biggest immunization program in history is expected to get worse next week, as health officials concede that public demand is exceeding the number of doses and the staff available to administer the vaccine.</p>
<p>Provinces reported clinic shutdowns Friday and federal officials painted a gloomy outlook for the week ahead because they have received only one-fifth the amount of vaccine that they had expected to distribute nationwide.</p>
<p>The manufacturer, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, has fallen behind because it is making a special vaccine for pregnant women, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones told a news conference.</p>
<p>Word of the production slowdown came as the World Health Organization reversed its earlier position and said Friday there is now no reason for pregnant women to favour the special version being made exclusively for them.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> has switched its one production line back to making the regular vaccine, but it will take some time to ramp up to the target of producing three million doses per week.</p>
<p>Butler Jones said that officials learned Thursday they will have only 400,000 new doses to ship out next week and another 225,000 doses reserved for pregnant women -- far short of the six million that have been distributed thus far.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones, who had maintained until the last few days that there would be plenty of vaccine for everyone, cautioned that the H1N1 campaign is being delivered in "real time" so there are many unprecedented challenges that were not anticipated.</p>
<p>"We're producing it, testing it, distributing it, giving it to people all at the same time," he said.</p>
<p>"It is something that nobody has ever actually had to deal with before in this kind of context. It's the largest immunization campaign in history."</p>
<p>The goal, he said, is to have Canadians who want the H1N1 shot immunized by Christmas.</p>
<p>His appeal for patience was little comfort in many quarters, where Canadians were turned away by the hundreds as clinics ran out of time and supply on Friday and provinces scrambled to revamp their strategies.</p>
<p>Ontario's chief medical officer said plans to open up clinics to the general public next week have been put on hold and that the province will continue next week to administer shots only to at-risk residents -- children under six, pregnant women, seniors, health workers and people with chronic conditions. Several other provinces say they will do the same, including Nova Scotia, Quebec, and Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>As H1N1 clinics extend their hours or shut their doors early, complaints persisted about the distribution system, which has been confined to only a small number of large venues rather than smaller outlets such as doctors' offices.</p>
<p>Lindsay Harris, standing in line in Toronto with her 10-month-old daughter, Juliet, was not impressed by the long wait in the rain.</p>
<p>"The fact that they've known about the swine flu and they've been warning us about an outbreak for months now, and the fact that they just don't seem to be prepared for this vaccination, is mind-boggling," she said.</p>
<p>Kumanan Wilson, an expert on pandemic preparedness at University of Ottawa, said there is not enough public information to decipher what, if anything, has created a bottleneck in trying to mass immunize the Canadian public.</p>
<p>He speculated that because the federal government received its vaccination supply earlier than anticipated, the provinces were perhaps "caught off-guard" in terms of how to distribute it.</p>
<p>At the same time, the death of two Ontario children created a mass panic that prompted Canadians to turn up in clinics in droves -- including those who are not considered to be in high-risk groups.</p>
<p>"It obviously alarmed a lot of people and contributed to demand for the vaccine that otherwise might not have occurred."</p>
<p>Kumanan suggested that the biggest single road block has been the failure to administer the vaccine in schools.</p>
<p>In Calgary, all five clinics were suspended and some closed as early as 9:45 a.m. as people had started lining up at 3 a.m. The situation was much the same in Edmonton.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Minister Ron Liepert warned the province will run out of H1N1 vaccine by next week if public demand continues at its current pace, which could force the government to close some clinics.</p>
<p>While other provinces have tried to first vaccinate those at the highest risk of contracting the flu, Alberta immediately offered its entire population the vaccine.</p>
<p>Alberta health officials also confirmed another H1N1-related death, bringing the total reported number of Canadians who have succumbed to the illness to 95.</p>
<p>Newfoundland's health minister, Jerome Kennedy, said that the province could exhaust its supply by Saturday, due to overwhelming demand Friday, the first day the shots were available to the at-risk public.</p>
<p>Hospitals reported strains on their emergency rooms as they coped with an influx of patients. The IWK Health Centre in Halifax cancelled some elective surgeries for children and women, and some ambulatory clinics to accommodate H1N1 patients.</p>
<p>In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the country has seen more hospitalizations in people under 65 with flu than what is normally seen in an entire flu season.</p>
<p>The centre reported one of the largest single-week jumps in pediatric deaths from H1N1 since the outbreak began in April.</p>
<p>Nineteen more children died from lab-confirmed H1N1 in the past week, bringing the total number of deaths in children in the U.S. to 114. More than two-thirds have been children with underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>"This is a younger people's flu," Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC, said in a briefing Friday.</p>
<p>"In a usual flu season 90 per cent of the deaths are among people over the age of 65. In H1N1, 90 per cent of deaths are in people under the age of 65."</p>

</p>
<p>To limit the spread of influenza, visitors are being limited at Regina's emergency room departments.</p>
<p>Adults with flu symptoms are asked not to bring anyone with them to the emergency rooms.</p>
<p>"We will allow children to have one parent in the flu area," said Glen Perchie, executive director of Emergency, EMS and Ambulatory Care with the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region.</p>
<p>"It's a lot of work for us because we have to protect the parent as well."</p>
<p>He added staff will make exceptions on a case-by-case basis for situations such as an adult child accompanying an elderly parent.</p>
<p>"Every circumstance is a little different, so we will certainly be ethical," Perchie said.</p>
<p>Staff caring for people with flu symptoms must change protective equipment, such as masks, gloves and gowns, each time they treat a new patient. To avoid cross contamination, patients with flu symptoms are being segregated from other emergency room patients.</p>
<p>It's early days in what could be a protracted influenza season, but already Perchie said the city's emergency rooms are seeing an increase of patients.</p>
<p>Typically, the Regina General Hospital's emergency department treats 150 patients a day. These days, that number is about 170. As more patients come to the emergency rooms, Perchie warns that wait times will lengthen.</p>
<p>"We want to make sure that people are using the emergency rooms appropriately because our concern is that they will become quite busy," he said.</p>
<p>There's been a small spike of influenza cases among EMS and emergency room staff, but Perchie said it hasn't seriously impacted staffing levels.</p>
<p>He was unable to provide an exact number of the region's staff who have received the H1N1 vaccination, but he added he's not aware of anyone who has chosen not to get it.</p>
<p>Symptoms of influenza-like illness that require urgent medical care include sudden chest pain, increasing shortness of breath, sudden and severe headache or frequent vomiting and diarrhea, which can cause dehydration.</p>
<p>People with chronic health conditions, children and pregnant women in their second and third trimesters who experience flu symptoms should contact their doctor or phone HealthLine at 1-877-800-0002 for medical advice.</p>
<p>"If you're experiencing some urgent symptoms that are really concerning you and you think, 'I'm at risk,' then by all means come to the emergency room department," Perchie said.</p>
<p>He said it's a problem that some patients with mild symptoms are asking to be tested for H1N1 at the emergency departments.</p>
<p>"I need to be very clear -- we are not testing for H1N1 unless we're going to admit you and we're concerned that you have very severe symptoms," Perchie said.</p>
<p>"We're managing patients by symptom, not by testing."</p>

</p>
<p>On Monday, the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region will start vaccinating a new group of people for the H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Those eligible for the shot include children six months to less than five years. This age group will require two doses of the H1N1 vaccine three or more weeks apart. Guidance will be provided at the clinics.</p>
<p>Women who are more than 20 weeks pregnant and those less than 20 weeks, but who are considered high risk, can also get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Those who have given birth in the past month will also be able to roll up their sleeves.</p>
<p>The adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine is safe for pregnant women, but those who have not reached 20 weeks gestation and are not at high risk can wait for the unadjuvanted vaccine, expected to be available the week of Nov. 9.</p>
<p>As more vaccine becomes available, vaccinations will be extended to other high-risk groups, and then the general public.</p>

<p>'Tis all hallows' eve -- a time when the rest of you need to be very afraid of the dead returning from the netherworld and the piercing screams of the banshees send chills up your spine.</p>
<p>Of course, those of us who hang around the Saskatchewan legislature and have already witnessed the resurrection of Dwain Lingenfelter and the recent nasty throne speech replies from NDP backbenchers no longer have such fear.</p>
<p>We're not frightened by the ghostly-pale, thin apparition that now silently stalks us, for we know that Lingenfelter will eventually allow Frank Quennell to ask something during question period.</p>
<p>We live "Hell night" daily. We fear no man, supernatural nor mortal (with the obvious exception of Lyle Stewart. And in the wake of Thursday morning's unfortunate encounter between Stewart and that would-be car-jacker, perhaps now would be an appropriate occasion to offer my apologies for anything I've ever written that might have offended the 58-year-old Thunder Creek MLA, his mother, his sister, etc . . . )</p>
<p>But lest we be accused of smearing all New Democrats with the same theatrical blood, let's offer credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>Leadership hopeful Deb Higgins's throne speech response was particularly good. She went through the 15-page address and found 53 old initiatives repeated in the speech. New Democrat MLAs have also generally scored well in question period by sticking to substantive issues like the essential services legislation and H1N1.</p>
<p>Moreover, they've had justifiable reason to be frustrated with inadequate responses they've often received from government ministers. For instance, Corrections and Public Safety Minister Yogi Huyghebaert's justification for breaking his own government's protocol by not notifying the public that a man convicted of sexual assault was unlawfully at large (and then attempting to blame the problem on the NDP for raising the issue publicly) was clearly irksome.</p>
<p>Bad answers frustrate Opposition MLAs, as do disrespectful, condescending ones. (So perhaps it would be helpful if the usually gracious Health Minister Don McMorris wouldn't preface his question period answers to NDP health critic Judy Junor by advising her that he will speak slowly so that she can understand.)</p>
<p>Finally, some Sask. Party MLAs were similarly ridiculous this week. (Case in point: The aforementioned Mr. Huyghebaert's propensity for calling New Democrats "socialists" and Saskatoon Sutherland MLA Joceline Schriemer's suggestion that NDP MLAs would sooner see addicts die of overdoses than get counseling.)</p>
<p>But such Sask. Party snippiness pales compared with the premeditated attempts by NDP MLAs Sandra Morin and Darcy Furber to use their throne speech replies (and the absolute privilege from slander lawsuits that the chamber provides) to assassinate Wall's character.</p>
<p>Morin's speech was ghastly, again smearing Wall for that now 18-year-old videotape, his resume in business and his signature on a now 20-year-old request form to have free liquor sent to then-liquor board minister John Gerich's office. Besides the fact that these "issues" were long ago raised by the NDP, what's more irksome is that they came from a person who, two years ago, had one of the worst meltdowns in memory over -- get this -- someone calling her a name in the legislature. (If you don't like to be treated in a nasty way, perhaps you shouldn't treat other people that way.)</p>
<p>Furber -- who evidently learned well from his days as a ministerial assistant to the notoriously nasty Eldon Lautermilch -- even more ghoulishly suggested that it was "well-documented" the "premier of this province was involved in a scandal" that sent many to jail. The clear and sleazy implication was that Wall was part of the Conservative caucus fraud, which he clearly wasn't.</p>
<p>So what do such cheap shots accomplish?</p>
<p>Do they set a tone to make the legislature more workable, thus bolstering the NDP's credibility as a government-in-waiting? Do they simply make the NDP caucus look still angry and embittered? Or do they just make all MLAs look bad, fueling another round of nastiness that might come back to haunt the NDP?</p>
<p>Maybe that's something that Morin and Furber need to think about this Halloween night. The only people they are now scaring are potential voters.</p>

</div><div>Saskatchewan News Network; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>447 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>

<p>The provincial government's roll-out plan for H1N1 immunization will continue as scheduled next week, even though Saskatchewan will be receiving far less vaccine than originally thought.</p>
<p>But health officials say future plans will have to be re-evaluated after learning it will receive 13,000 doses -- not the 60,000 it expected -- in its next vaccine shipment.</p>
<p>In a release issued late Friday afternoon, the government said the shortage is due to the "manufacturer's difficulties in producing enough vaccine to meet demand."</p>
<p>As a result, health officials say the province's supply will need to be carefully managed until more vaccines arrive.</p>
<p>"While this is disappointing and frustrating news, we do have enough vaccine to immunize young children and pregnant and post-partum women as planned next week," Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Moira McKinnon said in a release. "We will continue to open up vaccine clinics to other high-risk groups based on available vaccine and the most current information we have about H1N1's tendencies and patterns."</p>
<p>"The vaccine that is currently available is just nowhere near enough" to proceed with the province's initial immunization plans, says Dr. Ross Findlater, deputy medical health officer at the Saskatoon Health Region.</p>
<p>Beginning next week, medical staff will begin to vaccinate women who are more than 20 weeks pregnant and those less than 20 weeks but who are considered high risk. Those who have given birth in the past month will also be able to roll up their sleeves.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the program had been expanded to include only children from six months to five years.</p>
<p>Mass immunization targeting health-care workers and health region employees has started and about 80 to 90 per cent of health-care workers in the province have now been immunized.</p>
<p>In addition to young children, pregnant women and health-care workers, other groups who appear to be more vulnerable to serious illness from the H1N1 virus include people with chronic heart, lung and kidney diseases, people with diabetes, HIV, cancer, or those taking immunosuppressant drugs, and obese people.</p>
<p>When the vaccine will be available for them, or to the general public, Findlater couldn't say.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan and the rest of the country are completely dependent on the rate at which the vaccine is manufactured and distributed, he says.</p>
<p>In the meantime, health officials say all Saskatchewan residents are urged to continue with infection prevention measures such as frequent washing of hands and staying home if unwell.</p>
<p>Up-to-date vaccine clinic information will continue to be posted at www.health.gov.sk.ca[http://www.health.gov.sk.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca].</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu rage; The ugly side of the outbreak</b>
</div><div>Misty Harris   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>792 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>As much as flu fears have people pulling away, H1N1 is also uniting Canadians through emotion -- specifically, a deeply entrenched sense of frustration that, for many, has mutated into bitterness, anger and even hostility.</p>
<p>Call it flu rage. Across the country, otherwise mild-mannered Canadians are finding themselves admonishing strangers for open sneezing, losing their cool with queue-jumpers at vaccination clinics, writing angry letters to government and media, and lashing out at friends whose H1N1 opinions differ from their own.</p>
<p>"Anger can cause us to be proactive ... but it can also become destructive, which is what we see with flu rage," says psychologist Gordon Asmundson, a professor whose research at the University of Regina includes health anxiety.</p>
<p>"It's about a sense of uncertainty combined with the feeling of having no control over a situation," Asmundson told the Leader-Post's Pamela Cowan earlier this week.</p>
<p>"We tend to catastrophize when we're anxious."</p>
<p>Tami Xanthakis, a proofreader from Montreal, can't remember the last time she was this worked up about something as "elementary" as a flu shot.</p>
<p>"What's fuelled my anger is feeling like I'm between a rock and a hard place, not knowing what to do," says Xanthakis. "I feel like the government is pushing us to do this -- like, 'Just be quiet and take it.' But I don't know enough to feel secure with the vaccine."</p>
<p>For others, such as Barbara Carlson of Dawson's Creek, B.C., it's media "hysteria" and Internet half-truths that make her bristle.</p>
<p>"This is the year 2009, and yet, people still believe in superstition and misinformation," says Carlson, a retiree.</p>
<p>"Do you know how many e-mails I've gotten that told me I could prevent H1N1 by cutting up raw onions and putting them in water around my house? I finally replied, 'Hanging a dead rat around your neck will do just as much good.' The (sender) was quite miffed."</p>
<p>Dan Hoch, principal of an elementary school just outside Calgary, says emotions are running high among parents and teachers alike, primarily because of what he calls the "mind-boggling" deficit in vaccination sites.</p>
<p>"This is a life-and-death scenario ... People are asking, 'How did the province not get it right?' " says Hoch. "What would it have taken to ask each school to give up their gymnasium for a day and vaccinate all the kids there -- literally run them through the same way we do on picture day? It could easily have been done."</p>
<p>Resentment also looms large among Canadians that find themselves constantly worrying about infection, whether from open-sneezers at the gym or those who blithely bypass the sinks in public washrooms.</p>
<p>"I think about it all the time -- more than ever before," admits J'Lyn Nye, a radio host from Edmonton who says she doesn't want to be "sheeple" by herding in for a vaccine she knows little about.</p>
<p>"I come in first thing every morning and wipe down all the studio equipment with Lysol. I love the guys I work with, but you never know where their hands have been."</p>
<p>Lindsay Harris, a Toronto-based mother of two, was so angry at the system Thursday that she posted a public rant titled "H1N1 stands for, 'I'm in hell' " on her blog, glowbabyfamily.blogspot.com.</p>
<p>"Who was the brilliant thinker behind only having 10 flu clinics for a population of 2 million?" asks Harris, whose husband was turned away from the vaccine line just 90 minutes after the clinic doors opened, because of short supplies.</p>
<p>"I even called around to see if anyone had heard of a black-market vaccination clinic. Now there's a thought."</p>
<p>H1N1 QUESTION OF THE DAY</p>
<p>Question: With the H1N1 influenza becoming more prevalent, is it safe for my child to go out trick or treating? If so, what precautions should parents be taking?</p>
<p>Answer: The Ministry of Health says although H1N1 is circulating in the community, all residents should go about their usual activities -- including enjoying Halloween. Public health officials ask parents to help their kids use best infection control practices: keep their hands clean and ensure they don't share Halloween party favours (cups, noisemakers, masks, etc.). However, if your child is ill, they shouldn't go out trick or treating or to Halloween parties. Sick kids should be kept home.</p>

<p>We are fully engaged in "gala" season right now, which generally runs from September through June, with one week off for the Christmas holidays, during which time we eat too much turkey and go up at least three dress sizes.</p>
<p>Gala season lasts almost as long as baseball and hockey, but there are no playoffs, and all the women wear stilettos instead of cleats and skates. (There are days I wished I had the skates.)</p>
<p>It's not everybody's cup of tea, but I love gala season. I know the goal is to raise money for worthy causes, but it's also a chance to catch up with people I haven't seen all summer.</p>
<p>It's an opportunity to gather with my Crazy Lady testers in the washroom and assess the nips and tucks and Botox that got us through those restless, uneventful months.</p>
<p>It might not look like it to you, but there's a strict protocol to gala season: You spot someone across the crowded room, hobble over to them on your heels, throw open your arms, do the "kiss, kiss" in defiance of H1N1 and say: "You look fabulous!"</p>
<p>This is almost always true, since the lights are dim and nobody can even tell you've got pink eye and bruises from the fillers.</p>
<p>OBSERVE:</p>
<p>"You look fabulous!"</p>
<p>"So do you!"</p>
<p>"No, I don't."</p>
<p>"Yes, you do."</p>
<p>"Really? OK, then. Thanks."</p>
<p>And so it goes. We wander off to our respective tables, secure in the knowledge that on this day, in this light, this is just about as good as it gets.</p>
<p>Unless we come across someone with much better eyesight. Or a less optimistic outlook on life.</p>
<p>There's always one guest in the room who doesn't know how to play, and that's the one who always seems to greet me at the door.</p>
<p>Just last week I breezed into an event, feeling that all was right with the world. I was wearing Spanx, but I could still breathe. I had on my three-inch heels and my hip hadn't given out. The rash on my neck? It had almost disappeared. I felt wonderful. Until she broke with protocol.</p>
<p>"How have you been?"</p>
<p>"Great. And you?"</p>
<p>"Are you sure? Sure that everything's OK, I mean?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely!"</p>
<p>"Your health? It's better?"</p>
<p>I hadn't known there was anything wrong with my health.</p>
<p>"Excellent," I said. "It's always been excellent."</p>
<p>"Oh, I just thought, given your colour ...."</p>
<p>"That's a hot flash," I snapped.</p>
<p>"Really? I didn't know a hot flash could cause a person to have such pallor ...."</p>
<p>(Note to self: Look up pallor, which could be a substitute for "pale.")</p>
<p>"And your husband? He's well?"</p>
<p>"Couldn't be better," I said.</p>
<p>"And he's still, you know, living with you?"</p>
<p>(Oh God. Had I misplaced another husband?)</p>
<p>"Well, great to see you," she said, looking around for someone else to empower. "I'm glad you're feeling better, and I hope everything works out for you at home.</p>
<p>"Do you still have a job? Not that you should worry. I'm sure you'll find one somewhere."</p>
<p>Suddenly I felt pale. My Spanx were cutting off the blood flow to my brain. My legs were trembling. I took one step forward and Bam! There I was, flat on the floor.</p>
<p>"I knew it," I heard from above. "It was the pallor that gave it away."</p>
<p>Slowly I rose to my knees, tucked my breasts back in my dress and motioned for her to come closer.</p>
<p>"Kiss, kiss," I said.</p>

<p>One dose of the swine flu vaccine is sufficient to induce an immune response in people aged six months and older, and pregnant women can safely be immunized with either of the licensed swine flu vaccines, the World Health Organization said Friday.</p>
<p>The highest-level advisory body to WHO on immunization and vaccination policy, an advisory group comprised of experts from around the world, has reviewed the results of clinical trials involving several thousand people and more than several hundred thousand who have been vaccinated in "real field" operations organized by 14 countries.</p>
<p>"All the reports received today following vaccination either in clinical trial or live vaccination campaign have showed the safety profile of these pandemic vaccines is good and is very similar to the ones which are known for seasonal influenza," Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, director of WHO's Initiative for Vaccine Research, told reporters during a briefing Friday from Geneva.</p>
<p>"Nothing special in terms of adverse events has been noted," Kieny said.</p>
<p>Given the significantly higher risk of severe complications in pregnant women who get infected with H1N1, especially in their second and third trimester of pregnancy, "these women can be vaccinated with any of the currently licensed vaccines," Kieny said.</p>
<p>She said both vaccines have a similar safety profile. "There is no reason, in (the vaccine advisory panel's) view, to distinguish between both types of vaccines."</p>
<p>The world body said a review of the current epidemiological situation of pandemic flu worldwide shows that teens and young adults continue to account for the majority of infections. Hospitalization rates are highest in the very young.</p>
<p>Between one per cent and 10 per cent of patients who get sick with H1N1 need to be hospitalized, and, of those who are hospitalized, 10 to 25 per cent need to be admitted to an intensive care unit; from two to nine per cent admitted to an ICU will die, WHO says.</p>
<p>About 10 per cent of all hospitalized patients are pregnant women in their second or third trimester, WHO says. And, pregnant women are 10 times more likely to be admitted to an ICU compared to the general population.</p>
<p>In July, WHO's vaccine advisory panel recommended pregnant women receive an non-adjuvanted vaccine if one was available. An adjuvant is a compound added to a vaccine to boost the immune response to the shots. That recommendation led Canada to order 1.8 million doses of non-adjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women -- a regulatory decision that is now leading to vaccine delays that threaten to compromise the rollout of the largest immunization program in Canada's history.</p>
<p>The federal government said it was informed by Canada's H1N1 vaccine manufacturer, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, that vaccine supply will be lower next week because its facility only has one production line for two types of vaccine.</p>
<p>GSK first produced batches of vaccine with an adjuvant, and by the end of the day Friday, six million doses will have been shipped to the provinces and territories. It temporarily switched its production line to manufacture 1.8 million doses of vaccine without the adjuvant, the vaccine that is preferred for pregnant women. It has now switched back to making the adjuvanted vaccine but because of the interruption caused by making the non-adjuvanted vaccine, there is a reduced number of doses for next week.</p>
<p>That could lead to cancellations of clinics and further pressure on public health departments to get high-risk groups immunized. Nationwide, Canadians are enduring hours-long waits for the shots while worried parents jam emergency room departments, looking for their children to get tested for H1N1.</p>
<p>In Geneva, Kieny said more evidence has become available since the recommendation for pregnant women was made in July. Studies in animals using both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines have found no evidence "of direct or indirect harmful effects on fertility, pregnancy, development of the embryo or fetus, birthing or postnatal development," WHO said in a statement.</p>

<p>I work at a doctor's office, yet, I was told by the health unit that I wasn't considered a front-line worker so I wasn't going to be allowed to get the H1N1 vaccine through the clinics. I asked the lady on the phone if she got her shot, she said, yes, she was considered a front-line worker because she worked for the health unit and was exposed to the public every day.</p>
<p>Teachers, firemen, police, receptionists, etc., deal with the public. Why are we not allowed to get the shot?</p>
<p>It takes up to two weeks to become effective, how long do we have to wait until someone decides that it's our turn, until after we've been exposed, until after we spread it to someone else? The way that the health unit is delivering these shots, deciding who receives them and who doesn't, is wrong.</p>
<p>I know someone who got her shot even though she is not in the high-risk category. She was just waiting with someone else in line. My question is, why are there different rules for different people? If you want the shot, it should be available to you.</p>

</p>
<p>A pandemic in its early stages, the H1N1 virus is spreading out there but is not as potent as the Spanish flu of 1918 and 1919. Fifty to 100 million of the world's population perished at the time.</p>
<p>Today, we have an outbreak called the Swine flu (or H1N1) that is far less deadly than previous infectious diseases that have come our way during this century. For those who want to avoid getting sick, inoculation is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Like the Spanish flu, the present day H1N1 strain is another communicable disease in a virulent form. The enormous loss of life due to the Spanish flu can be partly attributed to a lack of medical resources at the time. With H1N1 today, we have some of the technology and medicine available to us to fight this infectious disease.</p>
<p>H1N1 is responsible for 4,735 deaths on a global scale in 2009. Over 399,000 cases have appeared amongst the world population since we first saw this influenza outbreak. Another element concerning H1N1 is the media coverage and the public's thirst to know what this infection is all about. Awareness of H1N1 will help to send more people to the clinic to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>A sign of things to come, the clinics are operating at this time and are beginning to draw many people who are willing to stand for a couple of hours in order to get the shot. The Tecumseh Knights of Columbus Hall was the first area clinic to engage the public, having attracted over 1,000.</p>

<p>While lineups swamp flu vaccination clinics and public health agencies seek more supplies of the H1N1 vaccine, area school officials remain vigilant, tracking absenteeism and taking extra precautions.</p>
<p>Student absenteeism increased just slightly this week at both area public and separate elementary and high schools.</p>
<p>But rates have eased by the end of this week, Sharon Pyke, superintendent of special education programs and services with the public school board, said Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>"We were noticing just a few kids more than normal," adds Jill Braido, communications co-ordinator with the separate school board.</p>
<p>"The numbers are really close to the norm," Pike said.</p>
<p>Both school officials said it's unclear whether the absenteeism is affected directly by H1N1, also known as swine flu.</p>
<p>Still, both boards, the Windsor-Essex Catholic District School Board and the Greater Essex County District School Board, have stepped up precautions, including reminders about hygiene and paying more attention to cleaning practices.</p>
<p>As an example, Braido pointed to the higher priority placed on fixing and replacing hand sanitizer equipment.</p>
<p>Pyke said there's greater awareness of the need to clean more often common and frequently used items like doorknobs and handles.</p>
<p>And there are reminders galore throughout schools, public and separate, about the need for handwashing, as well as cleaning hands before and after using computer keyboards and gym equipment. Besides posters, the reminders show up in newsletters and announcements in school and sent home.</p>
<p>Both school board websites, www.wecdsb.on.ca[http://www.wecdsb.on.ca] for the separate board and www.publicboard.ca[http://www.publicboard.ca] for the public school board, have posted H1N1 health information as well.</p>
<p>"There's been a lot of focus on prevention," Braido said.</p>
<p>The reminders also emphasize and encourage parents to be vigilant and keep children home when they're sick.</p>
<p>"We talked a lot about the flu with families and students," Pyke said.</p>

</p>
<p>Weird news on the social web this week -- @rogerdooley shared an MSNBC report from Florida: "Guy arrested for assault with ferret concealed in pants." No word on whether the ferret will be charged as an accomplice or companion.</p>
<p>From the bizarre to the macabre, @michaelallison shared a Vancouver Sun story: "<span class="companylink">Walmart</span> selling caskets online." Apparently Costco U.S.A. already does (<span class="companylink">Costco.ca</span> asked me "Did you mean basket?" -- um, no). Shipping not included. Some restrictions may apply.</p>
<p>Speaking of dead, apparently the oilsands are trying to get past the image of dead ducks, according to a story shared by @Christi_Millar on Marcel Coutu, CEO of Canadian Oil Sands. If oilsands companies don't get their PR in order, they'll be the dead ducks.</p>
<p>From the dead to the undead from @fullbodypuppets: "Dancing with the Undead -- Halloween pales next to Haiti's annual voodoo holiday," a fascinating account of a journalist's experience on Haiti's "Jour Des Morts."</p>
<p>An undead topic trending this week was Michael Jackson's new film This Is It. @oliverwaters tweeted "The Michael Jackson film This Is It earned $20.1M (£12.1M) at worldwide box offices in its first day!" The Twitterverse was chirping with Oscar talk amidst a cacophony of sycophantic Michael love. In the words of @channel4news: "This Is It. Michael Jackson. Video. Words fail us." Some of us are truly hoping this is it.</p>
<p>In other musical news, rapper Beanie Sigel trended on Twitter for dissing Jay-Z in his latest song. As @AmaniArk put it, "Depending how this goes we may have to put Beanie Sigel's rap career in a <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> casket."</p>
<p>Over on Digg.com, readers were voting up the Guardian's "Chinese Hymen" story, where reporter Mohamed Al Rahhal couldn't resist ordering the "virginity restoration product" that has outraged Egyptians. Shipping not included. Some restrictions may apply.</p>
<p>At NowPublic.com, readers were voting up the "NWA Pilots' Laptop Distraction 'Clear violation,' says Delta CEO" story -- you know, where two pilots swear they weren't asleep but were just busy looking at their laptops and thus overshot the runway by 150 miles. Probably installing Windows 7.</p>
<p>A little closer to home, DigitalJournal.com reported "waits of three hours or more are common as high-risk individuals seek protection from the second wave of the H1N1 pandemic influenza presently rippling across Ontario." Albertans were waiting up to six hours in the first days of vaccination clinics, but that is slowly tapering off as the bottleneck clears and more resources are mobilized. Meanwhile, Saskatchewanians are waiting for the vaccine to be made available.</p>
<p>In tech news, social media platforms rolled out their own changes this week.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Facebook</span> introduced the Live Feed, which promptly befuddled most of us, as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> often does with its inscrutable UI design. As the Vancouver Sun's @KirkLapointe said, "The longer I contend with Live Feed and News Feed at <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, the more confused I feel. What was broken that needed to be fixed?"</p>
<p>And Twitter added the "lists" feature to mainly positive reviews and some perspiration.</p>
<p>Said @kaigani: "Realizing that lists aren't just limited to your followers makes me break out in sweats -- i have an urge to categorize the whole of twitter."</p>
<p>To wrap things up, a little quote from @thequotemaster: "Be nice to nerds. Chances are you'll end up working for one -- Bill Gates."</p>
<p>As usual, send your cards and letters with hashtag #RTWT on Twitter so I can highlight the weird and wonderful stuff you see on the social web, or tweet me at @dblacombe.</p>

<p>Derek Wilken's top five scariest sports Halloween costumes: "Bankruptcy lawyer; 4. Olympic women's ski jumping attorney; 3. A Maple Leaf playoff ticket; 2. Washington Redskins bingo caller; 1. The final bill for the 2010 Olympic Games." . . . RJ Currie, on ex-Miss California Carrie Prejean being sued for breach of contract by pageant organizers for, among other things, not repaying money they advanced for her breast implants prior to the Miss USA contest: "Not since Dany Heatley was dealt to the Sharks has California seen this much fuss over a front-loaded contract." . . . Pamela Anderson was in Toronto last week and told a gathering of media she wanted to save Canada from further international embarrassment over a "barbaric massacre." What does she want; to disband the Maple Leafs? . . . A question from Bill Littlejohn: "So, if Shaq becomes a Deputy in Cleveland and sits in the Dawg Pound at a Browns game, do we call him Deputy Dawg?" . . .</p>
<p> From Vancouver comedian Torben Rolfsen: "Shocking admission from Andre Agassi that caught the public unawares: He has a book coming out."</p>
<p>Janice Hough, after a Philadelphia woman allegedly offered sex in exchange for World Series tickets for herself and her husband: "That's a tough one for men -- would you let your wife have sex with another man if you got post-season tickets out of it? Fortunately it's not a decision they have to worry about in Toronto." . . . If he had known you could get ducats for sex, Travis Henry would have season tickets for every team in North America . . . In a new book called Why Woman Have Sex, it claims many women use sex as a form of bargaining. Says RJ Currie: "Some reasons women gave were to get her partner to take out the garbage, or take her out to dinner or stop taking her to Cleveland Browns games." . . . Rolfsen says the 0-7 Tampa Bay Buccaneers are lucky NFL Europe no longer exists: "After their loss at Wembley Stadium they might be facing relegation." . . . In an amazing discovery, scientists have seen the light from an exploding mega-star. It took 13 billion years, give or take a couple, to reach Earth and is the oldest object ever seen. After scientists spotted it in April, they named part of it Jamie Moyer and immediately inserted it into the Philadelphia Phillies rotation . . . Comparing Darian Durant to Ron Lancaster? What are people thinking? Why can't we just sit back and enjoy watching Durant develop. Besides, I think Durant is less like Lancaster and more like Bart Starr . . . I'm not saying Mark McGwire has shrunk, but he apparently had options for three new careers before signing on with the St. Louis Cardinals as their hitting coach: 3. body double for Theo Fleury; 2. jockey at Churchill Downs 1. forward for the Montreal Canadiens.</p>
<p>Wilken's top three signs your new hitting coach is on steroids: "3. Asked to instruct nurses giving H1N1 shots; 1. Keeps getting larger batting helmets; 1. Favourite saying is 'Take a pill.' '' . . . Currie, on reports that Logan Campbell, who the New Zealand Olympic Committee threatened to sue over financing his 2012 Olympic bid with the proceeds from a brothel, is considering a countersuit: "Campbell says what he's doing isn't illegal, they just don't like the way he's making ends meet." . . . From Littlejohn: "Ozzie Guillen said he will not curse on Fox's coverage of the Series. Still the network is staying with its 45-second delay." . . . According to a report on stylepointsblog, Michael Vick was recently seen in a South Philadelphia store buying a bag of dog food. Really? A comment on the site said the dog food should be sent to Redskins coach Jim Zorn. Good idea, but I'm thinking a couple of scoops should go to the Toronto Argonauts . . . After the Raptors won their first game, Hough said it was cause for celebration in Toronto: "They can't remember the last time a team had a winning record.'' . . . The top three cartoon characters of all time, according</p>
<p>to animatedtv.com: 3. Mickey Mouse; 2. Homer Simpson; 1. Bugs Bunny. These are not to be confused with Mouse Davis, O.J. Simpson and Wacey Rabbit . . . Currie, after coach Brad Childress dressed up as a female flight attendant on the Vikings flight to Pittsburgh: "Brett Favre couldn't decide whether to make a pass or not."</p>
<p>Hough, after Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt fired his estranged wife Jamie as the team's chief executive, alleging that among other things she had an affair with her bodyguard: "Maybe he's just jealous that during the NLCS, Jamie may have scored more than the Dodgers." . . . Another from Wilken: "Rogers Communications has denied rumours of an impending sale of the Blue Jays, saying they receive almost 26 per cent of their mobile divisions' revenues from people texting 'Jays Suck.' '' . . . Rolfsen, on commissioner Roger Goodell saying he is not sure which of these cities will be first to have an NFL team: "L.A., London or St. Louis?" . . . Currie's take on the University of Central Florida allowing Marcus Jordan to continue wearing his dad Michael's <span class="companylink">Nike</span> shoe brand even though it may cost it a $3 million Adidas deal: "To forgive is human, to Air divine." . . . Littlejohn, after Taylor Swift was spotted with Valentine's Day co-star Taylor Lautner at a Blue Jackets-Kings hockey game in Los Angeles: "Kanye West suddenly appeared and told Lautner he should be out with Miley Cyrus." . . . Marty Burwell says Hockey Night in Canada should consider bringing back Fox's infamous blue glow puck for Toronto games: "Maybe this way we will be able to locate the team." . . . The biggest surprise about Pedro Martinez's start Thursday; he didn't beat up a tubby old man . . . Currie, after the Washington Redskins played the Eagles last Monday, ending an NFL record six dates in a row against a winless team: "Nobody has had more dates in a row with a loser -- except my wife."</p>

<p>I am a health-care worker at St. Paul's Hospital responding to the letter about a visitor not having hand sanitizer available (Back up talk on H1N1, SP, Oct. 22).</p>
<p>I do agree this is a problem. However, I happened to work on a Sunday when there was only one bottle of hand sanitizer remaining in an entire wing of St. Paul's. The problem isn't that we don't constantly restock. It's that whether it is patients or visitors, the hand sanitizer seems to be a hot commodity.</p>
<p>Hospital staff have witnessed people stealing the sanitizer with the attitude, "I pay taxes, therefore this is mine." And we have also seen people squirting it into Slurpee drinks.</p>
<p>So, as one of the members of the health organizations that needs to "walk the talk," I invite you to check out my cracked, dry hands from all the hand washing I practise!</p>

<p>It was a strange day for the Saskatchewan Party government Thursday, when the best thing that happened to it was an MLA getting assaulted.</p>
<p>Amidst stories of prisoners released early and mixed messages about sending surgical patients to British Columbia, Lyle Stewart fighting off and subduing a would-be carjacker was the talk of the province.</p>
<p>Stewart -- a little shook up but still displaying his dry-as-a-bone sense of humour -- had reporters agape, and laughing, as he recounted the set-to in defence of his 2001 Ford Taurus.</p>
<p>"It's not that great a car, really," he said ruefully.</p>
<p>One reporter asked if Stewart had told the assailant he was an MLA.</p>
<p>"No, I didn't play that card," he deadpanned.</p>
<p>Stewart had managed to phone police on his cellphone while pinning down the assailant under the dash.</p>
<p>"I think you can use a hand-held in that situation," quipped the CBC's Stefani Langenegger.</p>
<p>The Sask. Party government intends to pass a bill banning the use of hand-held cellphones while driving during this legislative session.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>There are second acts in Saskatchewan politics -- as witnessed by Glenn Hagel.</p>
<p>Hagel served 21 years as an NDP MLA, including stints as a cabinet minister, speaker of the legislative assembly and head of the province's centennial celebrations in 2005.</p>
<p>But the Saskatchewan Party was calling for Hagel's head in 2007 in their last legislative session as Opposition over his handling of a case of employee fraud when he chaired the NDP caucus in 1992.</p>
<p>Hagel ended up having to step down from cabinet and losing his Moose Jaw North seat by a mere 31 votes to the Sask. Party's Warren Michelson in the 2007 election.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, though, he was elected mayor of Moose Jaw with nearly 65 per cent of the vote.</p>
<p>There were few government members clapping in the assembly when Moose Jaw Wakamow MLA and NDP deputy leader Deb Higgins congratulated Hagel in members' statements Thursday.</p>
<p>But Wall said there was no bad blood, and Michelson offered his congratulations to the new mayor in person just as he had in a phone message.</p>
<p>"We're going to work with Glenn," the premier said in an interview full of nothing but good words for Hagel.</p>
<p>"Glenn was always, I think, in this legislature one of the ablest communicators, period. And through the centennial celebrations . . . he was tireless. He is going to do very well for Moose Jaw from that perspective."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Municipal politics is usually seen as a stepping stone to higher office but, as Hagel demonstrates, the reverse is often true.</p>
<p>Saskatoon saw the re-election of two former NDP cabinet ministers -- Bob Pringle and Pat Lorje -- to city council, along with Glen Penner, a Liberal MLA in the 1970s.</p>
<p>All across the province there were municipal candidates with strong connections to provincial politics.</p>
<p>Joining Hagel on Moose Jaw council is Don Mitchell, a former mayor, "Waffle" NDP leadership candidate and sometime gadfly to current NDP Leader Dwain Lingenfelter. Also elected was Terry Coleman, the former Moose Jaw police chief who was hired and fired by the Sask. Party government as a deputy minister.</p>
<p>However, provincial Green Party Leader Larissa Shasko couldn't make the cut in Moose Jaw's at-large council race.</p>
<p>In Yorkton, 2007 provincial NDP candidate Randy Goulden also narrowly lost a race for the mayor's chair.</p>
<p>And in Swift Current, Wall's dad, John, decided not to run again after five terms on city council, which were preceded by two terms on school board.</p>
<p>The premier -- who once joked his family was "the Mennonite version of the Kennedys" for its political involvement -- said his dad's final council meeting was emotional, but John was comfortable with his decision.</p>
<p>But the premier acknowledged his mom will have to get used to seeing more of his dad around the house.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>The legislative session began with the anticipation that Health Minister Don McMorris would be a lot busier in the chamber than he had been in the past.</p>
<p>With wait-time guarantees, health-care labour unrest and H1N1 on the agenda, expectations proved correct. McMorris was perpetually on his feet during question period this week, responding to far more NDP salvos than any other minister.</p>
<p>The Opposition attention may be having an impact on the usually affable McMorris.</p>
<p>In response to one H1N1 question from health critic Judy Junor on Thursday, he snapped this comment: "Thank you Mr. Speaker. I will forward my remarks through you to the critic. And I'll try and do it slow so she can completely understand."</p>
<p>But Junor -- a bit of a needler herself -- had the last laugh.</p>
<p>Later that day, it came to light that McMorris was unaware of discussions that had taken place between health bureaucrats and the B.C. government about potentially shipping patients out of Saskatchewan for surgeries.</p>
<p>"It's interesting the minister wasn't in the loop. Perhaps they didn't speak slow enough."</p>

<p>V is back with a vengeance, along with its message of paranoia and lizard people lurking in the shadows. Beware space aliens who speak with a forked tongue. The original V was a 1983 epic -- a slender idea about space aliens taking over the Earth, stretched out to two miniseries and a show lasting just 24 episodes, complete with '80s hair, cheesy dialogue and a small-screen cast of then TV unknowns. The new V, which bows Tuesday, is a big-budget -- by TV standards -- reworking of a by-now familiar idea. To read more, head to TheStarPhoenix.com/entertainment.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Parents urged not to flood ERs; H1N1 worries. Panic is clogging children's hospitals</b>
</div><div>CHARLIE FIDELMAN   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>1012 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>(From the Montreal Gazette, October 31, 2009) In some editions of yesterday's paper, a story about the H1N1 flu virus incorrectly said that the antiviral drug Tamiflu is not considered effective against H1N1. Two prescription drugs are available when flu symptoms are serious, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). The Gazette regrets the error. ***** </p>
<p>With her newborn asleep in a bassinet, Alexandra Bock rocked her crying toddler as she weighed the options, none of them satisfactory.</p>
<p>"I can't leave the baby alone - I'm breastfeeding," Bock said of 2-week-old Ulysse while eyeing the emergency room at the Montreal Children's hospital.</p>
<p>Every chair was taken, many of them by crying, coughing or lethargic children and anxious parents worried it would take "forever" to see a doctor.</p>
<p>After three days of fever for 2-year-old Romy, Bock took her daughter to the downtown hospital where she was born. But staff at St. Luc Hospital warned her their ER was too dangerous because it was filled with swine-flu-infected people.</p>
<p>So Bock anxiously weighed the risk of exposing baby Ulysse to H1N1 at the Children's packed ER, "or should I go to a walk-in clinic and maybe wait just as long there? Maybe I should just go home, and hope Romy doesn't get worse."</p>
<p>During a news conference yesterday, Montreal's two pediatric hospitals reported that the death of a Toronto teen has prompted swine flu panic that has filled ERs beyond capacity with parents seeking reassurance.</p>
<p>Nearly three-quarters of about 650 children brought to Ste. Justine and the Montreal Children's hospitals yesterday had mild flu-like symptoms. Each hospital is staffed to treat 180 children a day.</p>
<p>Hospitals will not administer H1N1 diagnostic tests for children showing minor flu symptoms, said Harley Eisman, medical director of the Montreal Children's Hospital's emergency room.</p>
<p>"I sympathize with parents, but step back and look our experience in May and June. The children did remarkably well," he said, with chicken soup and apple juice.</p>
<p>The hospitals are asking parents to stay away from the ER unless their children are in serious distress. Mildly ill children should visit their family doctor or local health clinic so that hospitals are free to care for the severely ill or injured.</p>
<p>The flu happens every season, and this year it is wearing the H1N1 label, said Michael Arsenault, head of ER services at Ste. Justine.</p>
<p>"The Toronto death is an exception," Arsenault said. "That's the message, because we've had a lot of, 'Fear H1N1 ... it will kill you.' A few will die, it's true, but there will be thousands and thousands and thousands of children who will be just fine."</p>
<p>The majority of children who died of H1N1 had underlying health problems, he added.</p>
<p>Quebec's swine flu guide suggests taking a feverish 2-year-old to the ER, but that should be amended to children under 3 months of age, Arsenault said.</p>
<p>Arsenault noted that the initial bout of swine flu in the spring was mostly benign, with the death rate not nearly as high as many had expected.</p>
<p>Arsenault and Eisman advise parents to only take children with flu symptoms to an ER if the children are also having breathing difficulties or are severely dehydrated.</p>
<p>Expect to wait between four to eight hours if your child is not gravely ill.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, parents are also stressed out over a temporary shortage of the antiviral drug Tamiflu (which is not considered effective against H1N1). A spike in demand has outstripped supply in Montreal. Several pharmacies have run out of the liquid version for children.</p>
<p>Monique Laganière of the Montreal Health and Social Services Agency said pharmacies will be restocked as of next week.</p>
<p>In the wake of confusion over appropriate doses for children, Quebec's H1N1 expert committee will make recommendations on the children's vaccine soon, whether one half-dose or two-half doses at a 21-day interval is best, said Quebec health department official Karine White.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some people have gone to hospital ERs seeking a flu shot. A McGill University Health Centre spokesman said no one should attempt to jump the queue by showing up at an ER.</p>
<p>In Ste. Eustache, where inoculations started yesterday, an estimated 800 people lined up outside a car dealership transformed into a vaccine clinic.</p>
<p>cfidelman@thegazette.canwest.com</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Go to the ER if your child has one of the following:</p>
<p>- Trouble breathing, hyperventilating, choking and white or bluish lips.</p>
<p>- Vomiting following an injury.</p>
<p>- Fever over 39C while under 3 months of age.</p>
<p>- Fever while having trouble waking up or being very sleepy.</p>
<p>- Diarrhea and vomiting, accompanied by a lack of tears, very dry mouth, and not urinating at least two to three times in the last 24 hours.</p>

</p>
<p>Alberta's health minister has granted nurses the authority to prescribe medications and doctors the power to issue prescriptions by phone as part of stepped up efforts to contain a flu pandemic.</p>
<p>The moves come as many hospital emergency wards deal with an influx of cases linked to the second wave of H1N1, a new influenza strain that first emerged in Mexico during the spring and has since spread around the world.</p>
<p>Other rare measures are also in the works, including cancelling elective surgeries and axing social gatherings, but their deployment depends on how H1N1 unfolds over the next few weeks, and how many Albertans become infected.</p>
<p>A pandemic response plan drafted by the province's medical board suggests a quarter of Alberta' population--about 875,000 people -- could fall ill this fall and winter. While most cases are expected to be mild, 3,800 to 11,400 patients may require hospitalization and 130 to 400 could die.</p>
<p>Both Premier Ed Stelmach and Health Minister Ron Liepert downplayed the figures Thursday, calling them a worst-case scenario that likely won't come to pass if a large majority of Albertans get immunized. Liepert also conceded he hasn't read Alberta Health Services H1N1 pandemic plan in its entirety.</p>
<p>"If people do get ill, we will take whatever steps are necessary to make sure our citizens are protected and they do receive the medical attention they require," Stelmach said.</p>
<p>The province hopes to soon add more immunization clinics and make the vaccine available at some doctors' offices and pharmacies. However, supply is a significant issue in Alberta and across the country.</p>
<p>But Dr. Judy MacDonald, deputy medical officer of health for Alberta's medical board, said it's "impossible" to say when doctors and pharmacists will be able to give out the shots.</p>
<p>"It's not going to happen before the middle of November, because we have to have sufficient vaccine to be able to supply those offices."</p>
<p>Aside from using doctors and pharmacists to deliver the vaccine, several other measures could kick in as H1N1 cases escalate.</p>
<p>According to Alberta's pandemic plan, cabinet could declare a provincial public health emergency or Alberta Health Services could issue regional states of emergency.</p>
<p>The province and its health board are also considering under what conditions schools and day cares should be closed and when social events should be cancelled.</p>

<p>DAVID SUZUKI, environmentalist</p>
<p>“I will when my turn comes up. I’m just astounded at people. Do they think doctors, scientists and government are out to poison them or something? I just don’t get what the objections are to this. What does that imply they think about the health experts?”</p>
<p>MARGARET ATWOOD, author</p>
<p>“The jury is out. I’m waiting for more information. I was told (by a talk-show host in New York) that as I am over 65 I may have some immunity, as my parents had the 1919 flu – it’s said to be related.”</p>
<p>SANDRA OH, actor, Grey's Anatomy</p>
<p>“We work in a terrible incubator. Definitely people are down with it. This is a perfect opportunity to get in touch with our health. I just went to Whole Foods and got $200 worth of vitamins.”</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER STEPHEN HARPER AND FAMILY</p>
<p>"They will not be jumping any queues and will be using the public health system, lining up for their shots like everyone else,” a spokesman said.</p>
<p>PAUL MARTIN, former Prime Minister</p>
<p>“Mr. Martin has not yet had his swine flu shot but intends to as soon as possible,” said Lucie Santoro, Mr. Martin's assistant</p>
<p>ANNE MURRAY, musician</p>
<p>“We have plenty of Purell and we are keeping human contact at a minimum (so much for fun on the road!),” said Ms. Murray's aide.</p>
<p>JANN ARDEN, musician</p>
<p>“I’m not [getting the shot, because] of all the reading and stuff that I’ve done. I’m coming into a period of time where I meet probably 100 people every night and shake their hands and have a picture taken with them. But having said that, I’m a chronic hand washer. I don’t think I’d be kissing strangers on the cheek or anything of the sort.</p>
<p>“I’m not in an office setting, I’m not going to groups, I’m not in school, I’m not in college. I live in a rural part of Calgary and I haven’t had the flu probably in 25 years. I just so, so rarely get sick. It’s remarkable. And also I’m an older broad. I’m not in that really touchy age group which is teenagers kind of up to 35, 38 and then the elderly, so I don’t really fit the profile. I’m 47 and I’m just not afraid of that. Am I crazy?”</p>
<p>PETER MANSBRIDGE, anchor, CBC's The National</p>
<p>“Yes, because I have become convinced that the risk of taking it is less than the risk of not taking it.”</p>
<p>RICK MERCER, Host, The Rick Mercer Report</p>
<p>"Absolutely. I always get a flu shot, and seeing as how this is H1N1, why would I not get it? Every doctor I know tells me I should get it. Plus I do everything that my government tells me to do.</p>
<p>"My lifestyle means I travel a lot and I shake hands with so many people. I shake hands with every single person in my studio audience every week and that’s 350 people. I take precautions like everyone else. I think everyone should get it, not just people who travel a lot and shake hands.</p>
<p>"In life, you take whatever precautions you can, and that includes getting the proper vaccinations and washing your hands and coughing into your sleeve, but I’m not going to change my lifestyle or stop doing my job.</p>
<p>"I’m hopefully going to arrange the vaccination through my family doctor. I’m a middle-aged man with no underlying reason why I should be near the front of the line, so I’m waiting until everyone else at risk gets the shot. I’m not pushing any pregnant women out of the way to get it.</p>
<p>"The people I’ve talked to who are worried about getting the H1N1 vaccination, the source of their concern seems to be a friend of their friend’s cousin’s brother who read something on the Internet. Very rarely does it involve health officials.</p>
<p>"The panic is worrisome. I wish people were getting the same information in every province. Every province is doing it differently. In Nova Scotia, you can get the H1N1 at the same time as the flu vaccine, in two different arms; in Newfoundland, the children will get vaccinated in schools; in B.C., it’s completely different again. Every province is different. We have the federal government once again saying this is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. That would depend on how one interprets the Canada Health Act; they like to interpret that it has nothing to do with them, so they pass the buck.</p>
<p>"The media coverage of H1N1 seems to be mass hysteria. When you report that hysteria is occurring, the result will be more hysteria."</p>
<p>KEVIN NEWMAN, anchor, Global's National News</p>
<p>"Yes, I will. I’m an asthmatic, and I’m really susceptible to the flu and it goes straight into my chest if I do get it. I’m not going to take any chances.</p>
<p>"I also have quite a lot of air travel coming up, which is another reason why I’d like to get the shot in me before that. Asthmatics are on the priority list.</p>
<p>"The problem is I can’t take a day off work to stand in line right now. The clinics here in Ottawa are good eight-hour waits. If there are any open this weekend I might drive into the countryside and hopefully the smaller centres won’t have such long waits."</p>
<p>SUSAN SWAN, author, What Casanova Told Me</p>
<p>"I talked to my doctor about the vaccine and she advised me to get it in early November which is when her downtown Toronto clinic will have the vaccine.</p>
<p>"She was very low-key in the way she talked about it. I am 64, not quite in what is considered the high risk category but never mind. I think all Canadians should get advice from their doctors on the vaccine since the media has created a hopelessly confusing scenario by portraying so many differing points of view about the vaccine. This isn’t a story that needs to be played from all angles. Doing that spreads fear and panic.</p>
<p>"In the late 1960s, I was a reporter on a Toronto daily and in those days reporters were taught that we had a responsibility to our readers to get the facts right. I wish I saw more of that responsibility in the way the story is currently being presented to the public. But then you won’t print this because I’m being critical of the media. Or will you?"</p>
<p>JEFF BATCHELOR, snowboarder, Canadian half-pipe team</p>
<p>"I see no reason to get the vaccine. I’ve always had a very good immune system, and I don’t think I’ve had a flu shot in a while. I also know many of my friends at school who have had [H1N1]. It only lasts about 10 days and what I would be worried about most would be the time off training."</p>
<p>DES MCANUFF, artistic director of Stratford Shakespeare Festival</p>
<p>"Absolutely. This is not only to protect myself, but I come in contact with a lot of people and I feel a responsibility to protect them. I only hope others are doing the same for my loved ones and me!"</p>
<p>JIAN GOMESHI, host of CBC Radio’s Q.</p>
<p>“Like many Canadians, I’m just trying to catch the latest line on the sickness named from swine. But I really don’t plan on doing anything different. I get a yearly flu shot at work. I will endeavour to get that. Otherwise the safest option appears to be avoiding any form of contact with any other humans. Ever.”</p>
<p>BRIAN BEDFORD, Stratford Festival actor and director</p>
<p>“Absolutely. Isn’t everybody? I think it’s an absolute must and I plan to make every effort to get it before I get on a plane next week, though I realize it takes a week or so to become effective.”</p>
<p>MATTHEW GOOD, musician</p>
<p>“Yes, I am going to get it. Having just had pneumonia, and because I fall into the high-risk category being that I have sarcoidosis, it makes sense. You come into contact with a lot of people on tour so I figure at this point it’s better to be safe than sorry. Mind you, that doesn’t mean that I’ll be 100 per cent protected, but as I said it can’t hurt."</p>
<p>MENDELSON JOE, folk artist, musician</p>
<p>“I won’t be taking the H1N1 vaccination. My doctor has convinced me to take the normal seasonal flu shot, but normally I don’t like taking any kinds of drugs or any of that stuff. It reduces my ability to fight it by myself. A healthy person can do that.”</p>
<p>ANNABEL LYON, author, The Golden Mean</p>
<p>“I am planning to get the shot, because my family doctor (who I've been seeing since I was a child) is recommending it. I definitely wash my hands a lot more and carry hand sanitizer in my purse. And buffet food makes me a little more nervous these days - I try to avoid it.”</p>
<p>ANDY SYLVESTER, director, Vancouver's Equinox Gallery</p>
<p>"I have never subscribed to anything like that in my life, but I am getting it. I don't know why. I think I've been watching too much TV."</p>
<p>VERA FRENKEL, artist</p>
<p>"I'm not impressed. My impression is that the government's mishandling is causing more fear than the flu itself. I will get the shot, but I'm not panicking."</p>
<p>MAX DEAN, artist</p>
<p>"I'm not getting it. I spend most of my time by myself, so I don't think it makes sense. But I'm going to wash my hands a lot, and gargle with hot salt water, and I think we're also supposed to nose gargle if we can -- whatever that is. Also, hot fluids are good, so it's an excuse for more coffee."</p>
<p>MATTHEW TEITELBAUM, director, Art Gallery of Ontario</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll be seeing my doctor next week. We'll be setting up a clinic for our employees at the gallery."</p>
<p>MEASHA BRUEGGERGOSMAN, opera singer</p>
<p>"I don't really have enough information about it to make an educated decision. [But] I'm generally quite germophobic so if the general consensus (along with the opinion of my family doctor) swings in favour of the vaccine, I'll probably get it."</p>
<p>DR. VINCENT LAM, author of Bloodletting and Miraculous Cures and co-author of The Flu Pandemic and You. He got his shot on Thursday.</p>
<p>"The hardest thing of all is to keep things in perspective. The thing that people have to understand is that there are enough shots to go around and people will be able to get the shots in the next few weeks."</p>
<p>ALLAN FOTHERINGHAM, author and journalist</p>
<p>“No, I’ve never been so healthy since I was 18. I play tennis three mornings a week. I don’t need anything. Besides, I almost died two years ago because of a fuck-up in a hospital. I went in for a colonoscopy and got a superbug because people don’t wash their hands. They gave me last rites three times.”</p>
<p>WILLIAM THORSELL, CEO, Royal Ontario Museum</p>
<p>“I get the flu shot every year ? and the H1N1 vaccine is just another flu shot. The only issue is that they’re not offering it in clinics inside the building. So the question is only if I’ll take the trouble to line up somewhere. I’m not going to get up at 6 a.m. to get in front of the line to get a flu shot. If it’s convenient, I’ll do it, and if it’s not, probably not.”</p>
<p>TEWANEE JOSEPH, executive director of the Four Host First Nations at the 2010 Olympics</p>
<p>“After a family discussion we decided to get the shots for our children as soon as possible – and when the public health officials give the green light [for adults not in a high risk group] my wife and I will get them too.”</p>
<p>BRAMWELL TOVEY, music director, Vancouver Symphony Orchestra</p>
<p>"Yes, I will be having the vaccine – one of my kids has already had it. Why? Because vaccines save lives. I fly a lot and airline cabins are wonderful places to catch germs – it would be sheer lunacy not be vaccinated.</p>
<p>"Last week I reckon I shook the hands of over 200 people – I spoke at community events, schools, and of course, at concerts – I have chapped, rough hands because I wash them every five minutes, or use cleansers. I’ve always been fastidious about that.</p>
<p>"However, from next week, we’re going to ‘knuckle tap’ or ‘elbow tap’ each other on stage – when I come on I’ll knuckle tap our concertmaster – normally he and I shake hands about 6-8 times on stage every concert. My daughters' football teams have stopped doing high fives and now do elbow tapping or knuckle taps.</p>
<p>"Our concertmaster, Dale Barltrop, said to me today that he thinks it’ll make us look cool – something has to ..."</p>
<p>STURLA GUNNARSSON, filmmaker</p>
<p>“I’ve already had the swine flu. I’m going to be the last man standing. ? It was miserable. ? It’s just the flu, a nasty flu. My wife and my son and I all had it [in September]. We had a sick household.”</p>
<p>DON CARMODY, film producer</p>
<p>“I contracted malaria on a film shoot in northern Thailand a number of years ago and since then the flu has caused me to have serious relapses. I always get the flu shot.</p>
<p>"I also offer it to any cast and crew I may be shooting with in the fall as a preventative measure, no mater where I am. It’s cheap insurance.”</p>
<p>CAMERON BAILEY, director, Toronto International Film Festival</p>
<p>"Like everyone, we’re talking about that damn virus at home and at work. Carolynne and I have six-month old son, Tate, at home. He’s just on the borderline of the age when kids can be vaccinated, so do we get him jabbed or not? Just one of many questions we have. Is hand sanitizer safe for a baby who puts everything in his mouth?</p>
<p>"Is the vaccine necessary for Carolynne, me or both of us? TIFF's human resources department sent out notice this week that we’ll have vaccinations in house as soon as they’re available, likely mid-November. I’ll be there with my sleeve rolled up. I’ve never gotten a flu vaccine in my life, but the sudden death of people who appear to be otherwise healthy has me spooked, and now that I’m a father I’d rather not take chances.</p>
<p>"I also find myself spritzing sanitizer a few times a day, and following HR’s rules for hygiene. Good thing the festival’s over and I don’t have to kiss so many cheeks.Our main aim now is to protect our baby. I can’t imagine how it must feel to lose your child to this."</p>
<p>DON TAPSCOTT, author, Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything</p>
<p>"I’m in Asia right now so it’s on my mind. Many people are wearing masks and there is a lot of discussion about contingency plans and business continuity and such. I am a believer in science, and I don’t subscribe to any government conspiracy theories about vaccines.</p>
<p>"So of course I’ll get the vaccine. I’m working on a new book with a deadline looming and I’m also travelling a lot, so I can’t afford to be sick for a day, let alone a week. Besides I think I have a responsibility to my family and fellow humans to not be passing along dangerous viruses to them."</p>
<p>ANDY BARRIE, radio host, CBC Toronto</p>
<p>"I’ll get the shot because:</p>
<p>1. I trust my doctor to do the due diligence on this one; she says do it, I’ll do it.</p>
<p>2. It’s a little like second-hand smoke: if I decide to accept the danger of smoking, I’m imposing that decision on anyone who shares my space. Same with the vaccine. If I don’t get it, and get the flu, and give it to you, I’ve made the decision for both of us. That’s why this is a public, and not only a private question."</p>

<p>Toronto --</p>
<p>Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre is opening a separate emergency department to exclusively treat people with flu symptoms.</p>
<p>The new ward isn't a walk-in clinic and won't be giving out H1N1 vaccinations, but aims to relieve the growing pressure on Sunnybrook's regular emergency ward as more and more people will flu symptoms seek treatment.</p>
<p>Hospital president and CEO Barry McLellan said in a press release the ward is designed to take patients who need rapid assessment for "mild to moderate severity influenza-like illness".</p>
<p>Dr. McLellan said the hospital hasn't yet seen a dramatic rise in the number of patients who need to be admitted for H1N1 or other flu, but there has been an increase in people with flu symptoms arriving at the hospital's emergency department.</p>
<p>Sunnybrook's flu ward will open today at 3:30 p.m. ET and will be open for eight hours each evening for the next week.</p>

</p>
<p>By the end of this weekend hundreds of Guelph residents will have joined the growing ranks of Canadians inoculated against the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>I will not be among them.</p>
<p>I'm neither old enough, nor young enough, nor ill enough, nor, as far as I know, pregnant enough to get my name on any kind of priority list. So my presence at the first day of local H1N1 clinics would have been frowned upon.</p>
<p>But my fortunate status as a 40-year-old, generally healthy guy is just one reason I will not have acquired another hole in my arm by the end of this weekend. I also simply haven't decided yet whether to get the shot.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this week, I think I had mostly decided against it. I have never, to the best of my recollection, had a flu shot and have also never, to the best of my recollection, had the flu.</p>
<p>I've had colds and sniffles, like everyone else, but never the crushing flu symptoms I've heard others complain about. But as this week has dragged on my mind is starting to change. There are two significant factors in that.</p>
<p>The first was the widely reported death on Monday of a 13-year-old hockey player in Toronto. The second came a day later with word my five-year-old niece, and her mother, both were diagnosed with the illness.</p>
<p>I have to admit when my wife first gave me that news, on the phone, it was a shock. Finding out loved ones have been stricken by an illness that is dominating front pages and newscasts, and has worked the country into a near-frenzy, is frightening. But after a moment, a thought occurred to me: It's the flu.</p>
<p>Obviously I don't like to see loved ones, or anyone, fall ill, and I certainly don't want to downplay either their illness or Evan Frustaglio's tragic death. But I can't shake the nagging feeling this H1N1 hysteria is more smoke than flame.</p>
<p>One of my co-workers this week scoffed when I floated the suggestion what we've seen over the past few months, and particularly in the past few weeks, is akin to so much fear-mongering.</p>
<p>I like to think I generally pay attention, and maybe my memory is shortening with age, but it doesn't seem people are any more sick this year than they usually are in late October. But people this year are much more hyper-paranoid than usual.</p>
<p>It's impossible to get out of bed in the morning without reading or hearing something about H1N1, and about the approximately 30 Ontarians who have died from H1N1-related illnesses since last spring. But this stat ignores, or at least fails to mention, that while this flu strain has claimed about 5,000 lives globally, that is a mere fraction of the hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide blamed annually on influenza.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious disease prevention and control at Ontario Public Health, told CBC Radio last weekend that because of how the flu virus mutates, next year's seasonal flu will be very similar to the strain we are now calling H1N1.</p>
<p>So if this strain is the one everyone will be getting next year, it makes me wonder the reason behind the panic this year.</p>
<p>The local health unit suggests we should be concerned about H1N1 because it is new and we have not had time to develop a natural immunity to protect against it.</p>
<p>I might get the shot. Either way, I hope the hysteria drops off as more get vaccinated.</p>

<div>EDITORIAL</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Another view: Wait patiently for flu vaccine</b>
</div><div>429 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>This editorial appeared first in the Hamilton Spectator:</p>
<p>Otherwise healthy children have died of H1N1.</p>
<p>Canadians have been shaken by the deaths of Evan Frustaglio, 13, of Toronto, and Vanetia Warner, 10, of Cornwall. These were healthy kids, taken with frightening speed by the pandemic virus.</p>
<p>Anxiety levels among parents cannot help but increase in the aftermath of these deaths. Paul Frustaglio, Evan's father, urges parents to be very vigilant if a child has H1N1 symptoms. That is wise advice. Panic will not help.</p>
<p>One immediate response on the part of worried parents might be to jump the queue, to butt in front of those who have been identified as high risk, in an effort to protect our children. But maintaining a level-headed approach is the best medicine right now.</p>
<p>At this time, the H1N1 vaccine is available in our area for high-risk individuals. It's important that those people-health-care providers and people most likely to suffer very serious health impacts if they catch the H1N1 virus-not be prevented from accessing the vaccine because members of the general public swarm clinics in a panic. We need to respect the way health officials have decided to stage vaccine availability in the best interests of the whole community.</p>
<p>Having said that, health authorities would be wise to examine whether children up to age 16 should be considered high priority for vaccination, given the recent deaths among otherwise healthy children and the increasing number of outbreaks in schools.</p>
<p>What should be clear to most people, though, is the importance of taking this pandemic strain of flu seriously, particularly when it comes to the risks to children. Experts say 90 per cent of children who contract H1N1 will ultimately be fine. But that means one out of 10 children who become ill with the pandemic flu are likely to be very ill.</p>
<p>Contrary to the beliefs of some skeptics and cynics, the seriousness of H1N1 is clearly not the result of media blowing things out of proportion. Nor is this a case of big pharma pushing unnecessary vaccines to improve profits.</p>
<p>The responsible thing to do as individuals is to minimize risk. Get the vaccine when it is appropriately available to you. Stay home if you have symptoms of H1N1. Protect your children by having them vaccinated, and working with them on protecting themselves through proper hygiene. Follow public health department advice about the appropriate circumstances in which to seek medical care and the appropriate place to do so.</p>

<p>WATERLOO</p>
<p>Peter Stirling considers himself healthy and hasn't been too concerned about getting a flu shot in past years.</p>
<p>But this year, with a pandemic flu around him, a pregnant wife due in a month and being the father of a two-year-old daughter, Stirling decided to get the H1N1 flu shot on Thursday.</p>
<p>"I work in a health environment, plus there was in-law pressure for the baby,'' said Stirling, who works in the school of optometry and is a master's student in environmental science at the University of Waterloo.</p>
<p>Stirling was among students and staff who lined up at the Health Sciences building at UW on Thursday. It was the second day of the university's H1N1 vaccination clinic.</p>
<p>The clinic is the first in Waterloo Region to be giving the H1N1 flu shot.</p>
<p>The university opened its clinic on Wednesday after receiving 500 doses of vaccine on Tuesday night, said health services supervisor Ruth Kropf.</p>
<p>The clinic hired a nurse and has two nurses on staff to give the shots.</p>
<p>In its first day, from 9 to 11 a.m. and again from 2 to 4 p.m., the clinic delivered 172 shots. In two hours Thursday morning, workers gave 100 shots, Kropf said.</p>
<p>Kropf said this week's clinics are for students and staff who have priority, who have underlying medical conditions or work with children, and for students in the clinical areas of the university. But other students coming to get their vaccination will not be turned away, she said.</p>
<p>"The sooner they come, the sooner we will control this,'' she said.</p>
<p>Kropf said she expects the university to receive another 500 doses when they run out of vaccine.</p>
<p>General clinics for all students and employees will be held on campus on Nov. 18, 19, and 20.</p>
<p>Kropf said during the first two weeks of November, clinics will be held in the evening as well, from 5 to 7 p.m.</p>
<p>At Wilfrid Laurier University, students can be vaccinated by signing up at Laurier Health Sciences. According to the school's website, all time slots are booked for the flu shots, which begin Nov. 3. If the university receives more vaccine, they will hold a second round of clinics.</p>
<p>At Conestoga College, H1N1 clinics begin Nov. 4 at the Doon campus for staff and students on a first-come, first-served basis. Vaccination clinics will be held Nov. 11 at the Waterloo and Guelph campuses.</p>
<p>Third-year student Stephanie Yantzi came to the UW clinic on Thursday because her mom, who has breast cancer, is undergoing radiation. Her immune system is compromised and Yantzi wants to make sure she doesn't make her mom sick.</p>
<p>"I get the flu shot every year,'' said Yantzi, who goes home to New Hamburg each weekend to be with her mother. "By getting vaccinated, I'm preventing the flu from spreading.''</p>
<p>Paul Snyder came to the clinic to get his flu shot along with his two grandchildren.</p>
<p>"The concern about H1N1 is warranted. The concern about the vaccination is unwarranted,'' he said.</p>
<p>Jennifer Fleet works as an administrator in the biology department. She, too, wants to make sure she doesn't make her two-and-a-half-year-old son sick.</p>
<p>"I'm not a believer in the flu shot but for this, it's specific,'' she said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some workplaces in the region that have held flu shot clinics in the past will not hold H1N1 clinics this year. Others are still undecided.</p>
<p>Teresa Muzzi, spokesperson at Sunlife Financial, said flu shot clinics have been held at the main office in Waterloo each year. But this year, the company was advised by Health Canada not to hold H1N1 clinics at the workplace, she said. There are nearly 3,000 Sunlife employees working in Waterloo.</p>
<p>Tom Nunn of <span class="companylink">Manulife Financial</span> said H1N1 clinics have not been planned at the insurance company.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Ontario residents seeking the H1N1 vaccine were urged Thursday to be patient and let those in high-risk groups go first, as high demand for the vaccine threatened to swamp clinics in Toronto and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The overwhelming demand for shots had thousands of people lining up Thursday at two clinics in Toronto. Overwhelming crowds and the resulting traffic problems even forced road closures near a clinic west of the city.</p>
<p>"There will be enough vaccine in Ontario for everyone who wants and needs a vaccine," Deb Matthews, minister of health and long-term care, told an afternoon news conference.</p>
<p>"But we do need to make sure that those who need the vaccine the most get it first."</p>
<p>Those people include pregnant women, people with chronic medical conditions and healthy children six months to five years old.</p>
<p>But with only the two locations operating in Toronto, people turned up as early as 6 a.m. and many decried what they called a lack of organization.</p>
<p>Some people shouted "I can't believe this is Canada," and "This isn't a Third World country," in response to the chaos around them at a clinic in the city's north end.</p>
<p>By early afternoon, both Toronto clinics - originally intended for health care workers and high priority groups - were turning away newcomers but said people already in line would get their shots.</p>
<p>Matthews rejected suggestions that the province was unprepared for the massive vaccination program, and said it is still up to local officials in each city to determine the best way to administer the vaccines.</p>
<p>People wanting the H1N1 vaccine in the northern Ontario city of Sault Ste. Marie aren't waiting in long lineups because that city implemented an appointment system.</p>
<p>The province will look at that system and may ask other cities to adopt it, Matthews said.</p>
<p>"I'm very interested in the Soo practice because I think we are seeing that it may be a best practice, so we're learning as we go," she said.</p>
<p>"That's working smoothly, so there are ways to do it."</p>

<p>ROYAL LAUNCH</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth has launched the baton relay for the 2010 Commonealth Games in New Delhi.</p>
<p>The monarch handed over the baton to Indian President Pratibha Patil at Thursday's ceremony at Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>The baton, which contains a message to the athletes from the queen in her role as head of the Commonwealth, will reach the Indian capital in time for the Oct. 3 opening ceremony. The baton will cover more than 190,000 kilometres in 340 days as it travels around the world before the 71-country event. Games organizers are racing to try and get all the facilities completed in time.</p>
<p>TOP DOCTOR CHARGED</p>
<p>The lawyer for a sports medicine specialist who has treated the likes of sprinter Donovan Bailey and figure skater Patrick Chan says his client has been charged with illegally importing and selling drugs.</p>
<p>Christophe Preobrazenski tells the Globe and Mail that Dr. Tony Galea has been charged by the RCMP and will make his first court appearance in December.</p>
<p>However, Galea says it is all about "a misunderstanding" with police over his use of what he referred to as "homeopathic medications" that have not been approved by Health Canada.</p>
<p>Galea tells the Globe that while the medicines have not been approved by Health Canada, that according to the College of Physicians and Surgeons, he is allowed to use them on patients, provided the patients have been properly informed.</p>
<p>SECURE BUDGET</p>
<p>The head of security for the Vancouver Olympics says the cost of providing protection for the 2010 Winter Games shouldn't go over budget -- and could actually be less than expected. Ward Elcock told a House of Commons committee today that he doesn't anticipate asking the federal government for more than the roughly $1 billion already budgeted. Rather, he told MPs that the cost of security could actually be less than projected -- provided there are no major security incidents, such as a terrorist attack. Next week, organizers will hold what they call the "Gold medal" security exercise in preparation for the Games.</p>
<p>KEEP 'EM HEALTHY</p>
<p>The Italian Olympic Committee is considering swine flu vaccinations for all its athletes going to the Vancouver Games in February.</p>
<p>CONI president Giovanni Petrucci has scheduled an urgent meeting for Friday with Italy's vice health minister Ferruccio Fazio.</p>
<p>Italy has reported at least six deaths related to swine flu over the past two months.</p>
<p>Italy expects swine flu cases to peak between December and January, with 1.5 million to three million cases.</p>

<p>Re: 'H1N1 shots should have started over summer' (Letters, Oct. 29)</p>
<p>I agree with the letter writer that the flu shots are a little too late and should have been available over the summer.</p>
<p>They say the shot takes about two weeks to take effect but we are already in the thick of an outbreak.</p>
<p>In my opinion, they should close the schools just for one week, cancel kid-related activities and sports, keep the kids home, away from each other while they disinfect the schools and buses.</p>
<p>They say the virus can live on a dollar bill for seven days, so there is no way they can get ahead of the disinfecting in the schools or on the buses with the kids there every day.</p>
<p>I bet it would put a dent in the number of sick kids.</p>

<p>Re: H1N1</p>
<p>In all the discussion about the H1N1 virus and priorities for the vaccine, there has been no mention of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD).</p>
<p>Those with FASD have deficient immune systems that make them more susceptible to viral and bacterial infections.</p>
<p>They also have cognitive and information processing disabilities that, with their adaptive and executive functioning limitations, will make it difficult for them to apply the necessary precautions to avoid infection. Hence they will be at greater risk for contracting H1N1 in an epidemic situation.</p>
<p>Ninety-four per cent of those diagnosed with FASD will also have mental health diagnoses. Many of them end up homeless or in prison. If those with FASD are not treated as a priority, they may act as a source of infection to the rest of the population. Clearly, people with FASD should be considered a priority for the H1N1 vaccine.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Just when you thought the issue of seasonal and pandemic flu shots couldn't get any more confusing, European researchers are questioning whether it makes sense to vaccinate little kids against seasonal flu.</p>
<p>The scientists, from the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, argue preventing small children from being infected by -- and developing immune responses to -- seasonal flu viruses might make them more vulnerable when a flu pandemic rolls around.</p>
<p>It's not clear the theoretical concern they raise is true. But other scientists counter that even if it is, it makes more sense to try to protect children from a threat they face every year than one they might face every few decades.</p>
<p>"The simple question is: should we let young children suffer from a severe and potentially fatal but easily preventable illness, just because there is a theoretical possibility that withholding vaccination might result in a slightly less severe illness sometime in the future?" a pair of Finnish researchers retorted in a counterpoint published with the perspective piece, in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>"We believe that the answer to this question is a simple one."</p>
<p>The argument made by the Dutch researchers may actually support a concern raised by some Canadian scientists about a possible link between getting seasonal flu shots and catching swine flu.</p>
<p>The research, which has yet to be published, is based on data from four provinces that shows higher rates of mild H1N1 infections among people who got a flu shot last year. The purported link, which hasn't been seen in data from several other countries, was first found by flu epidemiologist Dr. Danuta Skowronski of the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, who noticed it in data from that province.</p>
<p>The finding led most provinces to delay seasonal flu shot programs until after pandemic vaccination efforts have been completed.</p>
<p>Internationally, though, the suggested link has been met with skepticism and has been dismissed by some as "the Canadian problem."</p>
<p>Even the World Health Organization, which organized a teleconference of experts to explore the issue, has said the consensus of those experts was that the finding was probably due to a problem with the data, not a real risk.</p>
<p>But the Dutch scientists, who don't refer to the Canadian research in their article, say giving kids aged six months to 59 months flu vaccine prevents them from acquiring a broad immune response to flu viruses that can only be induced by infection.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada says H1N1 vaccine deliveries to the provinces will slow down a bit over the next couple of weeks. That's because the vaccine maker, GlaxoSmithKline, was asked to make special batches of vaccine for pregnant women and the switchover will lower output.</p>
<p>There should be 225,000 doses of unadjuvanted vaccine available by next week for pregnant women.</p>

<p>If it weren't for the H1N1 pandemic, Tammy Robertson and her two children might have been having a picnic.</p>
<p>At lunchtime yesterday, her four-year-old son, Jacob, played with his Leapster game as he sat on a blanket. Beside him, his two-year-old sister, Chelsea, quietly watched the latest Ice Age film.</p>
<p>Robertson had packed a portable DVD player, colouring books, Uno cards and plenty of snacks in anticipation of a long wait at the vaccination clinic on the lower level of the Chedoke Twin Pad Arena.</p>
<p>"We're all chit-chatting," Robertson said. "We're relaxing."</p>
<p>While the Mountain clinic and the one at Dundas Baptist Church were scheduled for 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. yesterday, both locations saw queues forming by 10 a.m.</p>
<p>By 2 p.m., there were about 1,000 people lined up for the Mountain clinic. Those at the end of the procession were told to expect a five-hour wait.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, about 700 people were lined up at the Dundas location. Acting city public health services manager Kim Dias said people could expect a three- to four-hour wait.</p>
<p>Both clinics had at least 3,000 dosages of the vaccine on hand yesterday for people under 65 with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women, children between six months and under five years, caregivers of people at high-risk and essential health-care workers.</p>
<p>But despite the large turnout at the Mountain clinic yesterday, public health services manager Fiona Newton-Brown maintained they wouldn't need to turn people away.</p>
<p>"We will not at all run out," she said. "It won't be a problem."</p>
<p>The clinics closed at 7 p.m. but those still in line by that time would get a vaccination, she said.</p>
<p>While some people were frustrated, many seemed at peace with spending a chunk of their day in line.</p>
<p>"It's something you have to do," said Robert Dox, a 59-year-old caregiver for his young grandson, after receiving a vaccination at Dundas Baptist Church.</p>
<p>"Once you take a day off, you might as well bear it," he said. "Make it a day, enjoy."</p>
<p>And parents sitting in lawn chairs, watching their children run around the Chedoke Twin Pad Arena parking lot, seemed to do just that.</p>
<p>In fact, Desiree Migliore, a home day-care worker who had waited in line with three toddlers since 10:30 a.m., said the makeshift clinic looked more like a playground.</p>
<p>"It's like recess time (at) a day care," she said.</p>

</p>
<p>Q: If the need to give the vaccine is so high, why are there not more centres in better locations providing the shots? One location in Dundas for a city of 400,000-plus people is a bit ridiculous.</p>
<p>A: Great question. The main problem is supply of the vaccine. We are giving it out as fast as it comes in.</p>
<p>Q: Why are the lineups so long? We're asking people with babies and young children to get their kids vaccinated as well as older people who have health problems. And we expect them to wait for hours and hours in line. Is there not a better way to do this?</p>
<p>A: Anyone who is too sick or otherwise unable to wait in line can talk to the staff who are managing the line and they will take them to the front.</p>
<p>Q: I want to get the vaccine ASAP, however, I know there is no way my 18-month-old will tolerate being in a lineup for even an hour. Is there any indication of when we might see the lineups reduced or doctors giving these out so that my family can get the vaccine?</p>
<p>A: Some family docs have the vaccine -- we are hoping that most will by mid next week -- but some family docs are choosing not to vaccinate this year because the ministry has placed significant administrative controls in place that protect the vaccine supply, but make it difficult for family docs to administer it.</p>
<p>Q: My wife is pregnant, due Dec. 21. She also works at a hospital, and has been warned by various health professionals not to get the H1N1 shot. She has decided to get it, but wants the non-adjuvant vaccine. When will this be available? I should note one of the people who told her not to get the shot works in the infectious diseases department at her hospital.</p>
<p>A: I'm sorry to hear that your wife is getting mixed messages. The medical evidence shows that this vaccine is safe and effective, and that women in the second half of pregnancy should get the shot ASAP, adjuvanted or not. Unadjuvanted should be available as of Nov. 9 at the latest, hopefully sooner.</p>
<p>Q: My three-year-old son has symptoms of a cold (no vomiting or diarrhea). Can he still get the H1N1 flu shot?</p>
<p>A: Mild illness is not a problem, get the shot. Just make sure you tell the people at the clinic so that they can keep ill people away from healthy people.</p>
<p>Q: I am 42 and considered high risk as I have a form of lupus, but I am hesitating getting the vaccine because I am scared of the side-effects like GBS (Guillain Barre Syndrome). Why should I get it?</p>
<p>A: GBS is extremely rare. It happens in less than one in a million doses, and it's more common to get GBS as a reaction to the flu itself than the flu shot. This is a safe vaccine and you are at risk from the flu -- you should get the shot.</p>
<p>Q: The adjuvant AS03, as I understand, contains Squalene, Polysorbate 80, Tocopherol, mercury and other ingredients. Aren't there studies that show that there can be potential health issues relative to some or all of these additives?</p>
<p>A: These components have been used in many vaccines and found to be safe. Squalene is a normal metabolite found in everyone's blood at all times. Tocopherol is vitamin E. Polysorbate is in all kinds of things we consume, including ice cream. Thimerosal is a preservative to maintain vaccine sterility, and the mercury in it is bonded to an ethyl group (not a methyl group, like the mercury in fish), so your body excretes it right away and there are no health problems. All existing data points to the vaccine and adjuvant being safe.</p>
<p>Q: My entire family got the H1N1 shot Monday. The kids and I both had low-grade fevers and I also had shortness of breath. Could this be a side-effect of the vaccination?</p>
<p>A: This is unlikely to be related to the vaccine. The vaccine has no active virus in it (only very specific chopped up bits of virus) so it can't cause an infection.</p>
<p>Q: I have bronchitis. I am on anitibiotics until the end of the week. Should I get the vaccine still?</p>
<p>A: Antibiotics are not a problem - get the shot.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Shut schools for week: caretakers' union boss</b>
</div><div>Ken Peters  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>583 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A04</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>The president of the local caretakers' union has urged that flu- ridden Hamilton public elementary schools be closed for a week.</p>
<p>Arch Walker, president of CUPE Local 4153, which represents 500 caretakers, maintenance workers and cooks in local public schools, said yesterday his members are stretched to the limit and can't keep up in the school flu battle.</p>
<p>Walker said the schools are not as clean as they should be.</p>
<p>"We just don't have the people to properly contain this," Walker said.</p>
<p>"I believe we have enough product. We just don't have enough people to use the product," he said of cleaning materials.</p>
<p>"I truly believe the schools should be shut down for a least a week and contain (the virus) at home."</p>
<p>H1N1 outbreaks currently affect 64 public schools -- up from 38 earlier this week. Hamilton Catholic schools have an outbreak in 10 schools as of yesterday.</p>
<p>"We have people showing up for work sick. We have teachers showing up for work sick. We have students coming in sick," said Walker. "You wouldn't take them to Fortinos or Sobeys if they were sick. I don't know why people go to work or send their kids to school sick.</p>
<p>"I'm fielding calls all day," Walker said. "People are at the point now of burnout, and they're being asked now to work longer hours. They are willing to do it, but they are at the point now of saying 'I can't do it anymore.'"</p>
<p>Walker said the caretaking staff focus on outbreak schools.</p>
<p>"When it is an outbreak location, everything else, normal cleaning, normal maintenance has to be put on the back burner and we go into the H1N1 mode, which is total scrubbing. When you do that, something on your normal schedule has to come off. It's catching up with us, quite frankly."</p>
<p>While there are no plans to close local schools, the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board is cancelling all staff training for a week.</p>
<p>John Forbeck, superintendent of staff and community engagement, said there are no plans to close schools.</p>
<p>"Parents of students who are well, those parents need to be able to go to work," he said, adding the board is looking to hire more casual staff to help with the flu battle.</p>
<p>Forbeck praised the efforts of the board custodial staff.</p>
<p>He said at the schools experiencing an outbreak, student absenteeism is ranging from seven to 20 per cent of the school enrolment.</p>
<p>Forbeck said 300 teachers weren't in class yesterday, but that includes 80 who were in training. That represents about 10 per cent of the board's 2,000 elementary and 1,300 secondary teachers.</p>
<p>John Malloy, directory of the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board, said the Ministry of Education has told the board to take the lead from Hamilton's public health department in any move to close schools.</p>
<p>Jackie Bajus, education superintendent with the Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board, said student absenteeism is averaging about 10 to 15 per cent.</p>
<p>Staff absenteeism is up as well. Last October, 35 of 1,200 elementary teachers called in sick on an average day. This month the number is about 50. The numbers are similar at the secondary school level.</p>
<p>Bajus also stated there are no plans at this point to close any Hamilton Catholic schools.</p>

<p>She is curled on an ER chair wearing pajamas, a winter coat and a mask.</p>
<p>"I'm really achy," says Mila Berti, 17. "It goes up in the back of my head. I'm dizzy and queasy."</p>
<p>It's mid-morning and Mila and her dad, Mark, have been waiting in the McMaster University Medical Centre emergency room for two hours.</p>
<p>They are sequestered in the smaller children's emergency room apart from the main adult waiting area. The Bertis share the space with just two other families with sick children. All are waiting to be seen by a pediatrician. All wear masks. All are exhibiting symptoms of H1N1.</p>
<p>It is a far calmer scene than one might expect, given the three-hour lineups for H1N1 vaccines at the high-risk clinics and the vast roster of schools with confirmed outbreaks. Here, in this quiet room with the TV tuned to a kids program, there are no hordes of fluish children. No panicking parents. No din of hacking and coughing.</p>
<p>At night, though, it's different. At 6 p.m. the parents begin to arrive with their sons and daughters. They have finished their days at work and day care and school. They've come back together at home to discover someone has a fever. Or a cough. Or a stomach ache. They trek to the hospital.</p>
<p>By 8 p.m. the crowd peaks. Earlier this week, there were as many as 30 children waiting to be seen.</p>
<p>Right now, there are only a few.</p>
<p>Mila went to Waterdown District High School on Monday but only made it through first period. She started feeling unwell and decided to go home.</p>
<p>She has been getting worse ever since. The headaches are intense. Tylenol isn't helping much.</p>
<p>She went to a walk-in clinic Wednesday, but overnight she couldn't sleep.</p>
<p>So here she is. Shivering. Exhausted.</p>
<p>Dad is worried.</p>
<p>"I find the information getting out is pretty confusing," he says, raising questions about times and locations of vaccination clinics and who is currently eligible.</p>
<p>None of their four family members is considered high risk. So they are just waiting for the first opportunity to get their shots, says Mark.</p>
<p>A few seats away is Rishma and her energetic three-year-old, Sabrina.</p>
<p>Sabrina feels great. She's the only live wire in the room.</p>
<p>At the opposite end of the waiting room is her sister, five-year-old Brianna. She wears a mask. A nurse gave her Tylenol as soon as she arrived an hour ago. The senior kindergarten student has perked up a bit, but is still quite lethargic. She's had a fever for two days. She sits with her dad, Narish.</p>
<p>"Trying to keep the girls apart is impossible," says Rishma.</p>
<p>The family's doctor is in Brampton, where they used to live. Too far to go with Brianna feeling so poorly. So here they are in the ER.</p>
<p>"I'm not too worried," says Rishma, who has been wiping down the house and enforcing hand washing in an effort to keep the rest of the family from becoming sick.</p>
<p>A while ago, she wasn't planning to have the children vaccinated. "Now, I'm thinking about it."</p>
<p>Brianna was supposed to be on a class trip to the pumpkin patch, but is here instead. Rishma hopes her daughter might still be able to put her Princess Aurora costume on to trick-or-treat Saturday night.</p>
<p>Some parents at the ER have much graver concerns.</p>
<p>"I think they're genuinely scared," says Dr. Bill Krizmanich, chief of emergency. "The biggest challenge parents have right now is the overload of information and deciphering things."</p>
<p>Krizmanich and his staff have, in some cases, treated whole families felled by H1N1. Sick and worried parents trying to care for their sick kids -- it's a stressful situation.</p>
<p>Though the ER is meant for only the "sickest of the sick," nobody will be turned away, he says.</p>
<p>Krizmanich along with Children's Hospital president Dr. Peter Fitzgerald have instituted an ad hoc influenza clinic now open every night at McMaster. Patients still come in the regular ER entrance, but children exhibiting H1N1 symptoms will be streamed into the special clinic. That is reducing wait times from three hours to half that.</p>
<p>As well as treating the sick child, Krizmanich says staff try to educate and comfort the concerned parents.</p>
<p>"I want them to feel a little bit more reassured when they go home."</p>

</p>
<p>Four kids with H1N1 are in intensive care at McMaster Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>That means flu is taking up half of the pediatric ICU beds in the city.</p>
<p>"We're definitely seeing a wave of healthy children who have been infected," said Dr. Cynthia Cupido, medical director of the pediatric ICU.</p>
<p>More than 50 per cent of public schools now have outbreaks. In total, 74 public and Catholic schools in Hamilton have been hit by H1N1.</p>
<p>Staggering numbers of students are staying home from school -- ranging from 7 to 20 per cent. About 300 teachers, or 10 per cent of school staff, aren't at work.</p>
<p>Cupido said McMaster's pediatric ICU is one of the harder hit in the province by H1N1.</p>
<p>"Our resources are stretched," she said.</p>
<p>Hamilton's adult intensive care units are feeling a similar strain, with the number of H1N1 patients doubling in one week to seven confirmed and one possible case.</p>
<p>"We're probably seeing at least double what we'd expect to see for this time of year in the ICU," said Dr. Peter Kraus, chief of critical care at Hamilton Health Sciences.</p>
<p>Wait times for flu shots continued to be hours long yesterday as Hamiltonians lined up for the only protection from H1N1 that public health can offer. Waits were about five hours at the clinic on the West Mountain, with 1,000 people in line. The Dundas clinic wasn't much better, with 700 waiting for a shot.</p>

<p>* Liberals lash Tories over vaccine delays; EU study questions the wisdom of flu shots for tots. A10</p>
<p>The scene has been the same at flu shot clinics across the province.</p>
<p>"I do appreciate that people are waiting a long time in line to get immunized and I'm asking everyone who is not in the priority groups to please be patient," said Health Minister Deb Matthews. "There will be enough vaccine in Ontario for everyone who wants and needs a vaccine. But we do need to make sure that those who need the vaccine the most, get it first."</p>
<p>However, Health Canada has informed provinces and territories it expects the supply of H1N1 vaccine being shipped across Canada to be lower next week because of a bottleneck in the production line.</p>
<p>Hamilton is expanding its flu shot clinics next week to four and opening two flu assessment clinics starting tomorrow for those who have influenza symptoms but can't get in to see their family doctors.</p>
<p>The clinics, which will not give out vaccinations, will be open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. on the weekend and 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. during the week at the West End Clinic at 690 Main St. W. and the St. Joseph's East End Ambulatory Care Centre at 2757 King St. E.</p>
<p>The province has put a self-assessment tool on its website at health.gov.on.ca to help people determine what they should do if they think they have the flu.</p>
<p>The assessment clinics and website are expected to take the pressure off overwhelmed doctors' offices and emergency rooms.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Tytus, family physician and president of the Hamilton Academy of Medicine, said doctors' offices are getting four to five times more calls than usual.</p>
<p>"We're swamped," he said.</p>
<p>Emergency rooms have also felt the strain. Nearly 50 per cent of emergency room visits at Joseph Brant Memorial Hospital in Burlington on Wednesday were from people with flu symptoms. Both McMaster Children's Hospital and Joseph Brant have set up flu clinics outside of the emergency room to deal with the increased number of patients.</p>
<p>So far, Hamilton and Burlington hospitals have been able to cope with the influx. The children's hospital is prepared to open up four more intensive care unit beds, if needed, on top of its usual eight.</p>
<p>Hamilton has had eight children in intensive care since H1N1 emerged in April, with seven of those during the second wave that started this month.</p>
<p>The majority of them were previously healthy with no other medical conditions.</p>
<p>A number of them have had to be put on ventilators, including one right now. There have been no child deaths in Hamilton from H1N1, although there have been three in Ontario. Hamilton has had four adults with H1N1 die. The virus contributed to or caused three of those deaths.</p>

<p>• 12:43 p.m. Oh my God. We've arrived by subway and emerged into the outdoor square at the North York Civic Centre and it is full full full of people</p>
<p>• 12:45 Was just told the wait is 7 hours</p>
<p>• 1:04 Nearby, a mom is helping her young boy relieve himself in the public gardens.</p>
<p>• 1:22 We came prepared: brought a stroller and rolling suitcase with books, games, a portable DVD player, snacks, homework and activity books. However, my children are simply amusing themselves by running around the crowds.</p>
<p>• 2:01 Police officers are standing at the line's end, turning people away</p>
<p>• 2:32 Just checked in with my wife (I'm running back and forth to <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> so I can live blog) and they are nowhere near the front of the line. We've got hours and hours to go. There's also talk in the line that they might run out of vaccine before we get to front, which would be VERY disappointing.</p>
<p>• 3:05 I think the mood is grin and bear it. Most people arrived knowing they had a terrible wait ahead of them. So the feeling is “Yup, this is as bad as I expected.”</p>
<p>• 4:04 Quick update from the line by Blackberry: Took desperate boys for a bathroom break, but no signs, no helpful directions. Found a bathroom in a nearby food court. Temperatures are dropping. “I can see my breath,” Noah just said.</p>
<p>• 4:06 We're still not even half-way there after three-plus hours. People keep showing up only to be turned away by a security guard. The children are very restless and running around the empty reflecting pool. There are puddles, however, and Ross just got a soaker. Agh!</p>
<p>• 4:29 Councillor John Filion and his staff are handing out bags of popcorn and water to the front of the line.</p>

</p>
<p>Andrew Raycroft has played in a Canadian market. He knows how fickle the faithful can become.</p>
<p>He knows he's going to be the meat for the talk-show grinder if he fails to provide the Vancouver Canucks with capable goaltending in the absence of injured starter Roberto Luongo.</p>
<p>"He set the bar pretty high here in what people expect out of a goalie and that's not necessarily a negative thing for me,'' said Raycroft, who will make his first start as a Canuck tonight in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>"I can't be Roberto Luongo. I have to be me. But that's not to say if I lose six in a row they (the fans) are not going to be ready to lynch me.''</p>
<p>Raycroft, with his fourth team in his 10-year NHL career, has a 1.13 goals-against average and .941 save percentage this season.</p>
<p>Boyle has broken thumb</p>
<p>San Jose Sharks defenceman Dan Boyle has been playing with a broken thumb for a month and a half.</p>
<p>"It's been tough," Boyle told the San Jose Mercury News. "My execution has been off a little bit, my shot hasn't been as good. You make certain decisions differently because you're in pain."</p>
<p>Despite the discomfort, the blue-liner still had two goals and 10 assists through 12 games while averaging 25:36 in ice time.</p>
<p>Too close for comfort</p>
<p>That Calgary Flames defenceman Mark Giordano fought one of the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday is no big deal.</p>
<p>What provides the twist, however, is that his opponent, Ladislav Smid, has since tested positive for H1N1.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine closer quarters than two hockey players fighting.</p>
<p>"It's in the back of your mind, I guess," Giordano said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"There was nothing I could really do. At the time, I obviously didn't know. I don't think he knew, either. But it's one of those things -- the virus is going around, so you have to be careful."</p>
<p>Greene walks away</p>
<p>Jeff Greene, a Miami Beach, Fla., businessman recruited by Tampa Bay Lightning co-owner Oren Koules to invest in the team, has decided not to proceed with the purchase.</p>
<p>Koules is looking for new investors through a league-approved process.</p>
<p>Gagne to long-term injury list</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Flyers on Wednesday placed forward Simon Gagne, who requires surgery to repair two small hernias, on the long-term injury list, and recalled defenceman Randy Jones from the AHL's Adirondack Phantoms.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 flu clinic targets homeless people; Advocates hope only inner city's disadvantaged population will show up for vaccinations</b>
</div><div>Cigdem Iltan   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>571 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Homeless advocates are worried people who aren't part of Edmonton's homeless community will line up at an H1N1 vaccination clinic today targeted at the city's disadvantaged population.</p>
<p>"People might be upset when they hear homeless people will be vaccinated when there are so many long lineups at (clinics), but people have to consider this community of people doesn't have access to those facilities," said Hope Mission spokeswoman Janelle Aker-Johnston.</p>
<p>"We would really like the compassionate side of people to understand that this population of people are the most vulnerable people we have in this city in regards to H1N1."</p>
<p>Nurses will vaccinate the homeless during a three-hour clinic at the Hope Street Festival. The temporary clinic begins at 1 p.m.</p>
<p>"They're the most susceptible to H1N1. If you're on the street for a couple of years, you're going to have a low immune system," Aker-Johnston said. "There's hepatitis, HIV, there's illness all around. You don't have a healthy sleep pattern a system needs--everything other people have that keeps them healthy."</p>
<p>None of Edmonton's five vaccination clinics are downtown. Homeless people don't have transportation and many have mental illnesses or other issues preventing them from visiting a clinic outside of the inner city, Aker-Johnston said.</p>
<p>Joseph Gladue lived on the streets for four years before he found help at the Hope Mission's Herb Jamieson Centre. He takes part in its treatment program. The 21-year-old already received his seasonal influenza vaccination this year, and plans to line up today to receive his H1N1 vaccination. It's important for all people in the homeless community to receive the vaccination, he said.</p>
<p>"I'm glad they're giving away vaccines. Without it, everyone's immune system would be really weak," Gladue said.</p>
<p>Calvin Hinkley eats some meals at the Hope Mission and occasionally stays overnight.</p>
<p>He plans to go to the festival but will make up his mind about getting the vaccine when he arrives there.</p>
<p>"It depends on how long the line is," Hinkley said.</p>
<p>It's unclear how many vaccination units will be available, but nurses plan on vaccinating as many people as they can, Aker-Johnston said.</p>
<p>"Alberta Health Services will try to do as many as they can within the three hours they have slotted. There isn't an exact number."</p>
<p>The clinic won't turn away someone who is not part of the homeless community, but hopes people who are not part of that community do not go, said Boyle McCauley Health Centre executive director Cecilia Blasetti.</p>
<p>"We certainly do not have any intention of sorting out who can get it and who can't."</p>
<p>The Hope Street Festival is in celebration of the grand opening of the newly renovated historic Immigration Hall, an apartment building with suites available to inner-city residents.</p>
<p>About 600 to 800 people are expected to show up for the festival, Aker-Johnston said.</p>
<p>Traffic on 105A Avenue and 100th Street will be closed this afternoon for the festival.</p>

<p>It was with utter dismay and a sense of sadness when I heard Premier Ed Stelmach's response in the legislature to questions from Brian Mason related to the H1N1 immunization program for high-risk Albertans.</p>
<p>Stelmach's comments were meant to be both belittling and abusive, and directed at Mason's previous occupation as an Edmonton bus driver.</p>
<p>Mason question was merely to ensure the homeless of this city receive equal access to the H1N1 immunization. Stelmach's response was what you would expect in a schoolyard squabble, not from the premier of Alberta.</p>
<p>Stelmach lacks class and his demeanour does not befit what is expected of the premier in times of a health pandemic. His actions and comments do not portray a sense of leadership, or instil trust in the average Albertan that he are able to mange the serious health problem that faces us.</p>
<p>It sadness me that, under scrutiny, Stelmach and senior members of his government are dismissive and insulting to other elected MLAs who dare to criticize the actions of the government.</p>
<p>This attitude does not encourage me to provide input into the future of health care when we are witness to the premier's insulting and vindictive style of leadership.</p>

<p>As a recent university graduate, I am all too familiar with lineups and being treated as a number. So when I attended the Rutherford Health clinic to receive my H1N1 vaccine, I was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>Chairs were set out along the line so that people who needed to take a quick rest or mothers needing to feed children were able to do so. The people around me were all friendly and offered to hold my spot in line if I needed to go to the washroom or grab a coffee.</p>
<p>Considering the wait time, most people were in good spirits. One little boy even came around sharing his pack of cookies.</p>
<p>Once I made it to a nurse to get my vaccine, I appreciated the time she took to explain everything to me and answer my questions. Following the vaccine, there is a mandatory wait period of 15 minutes to make sure you don't have any immediate reactions. The clinic had a room set up down the hall for us to wait in with lots of chairs and, thanks to the Second Cup across the street, there was free coffee and squares as a snack!</p>
<p>From start to finish, my total time at the clinic was only 2½hours. Considering it was only the second day that the vaccine was available, and the fact that it is free to all residents, I found the wait to be quite reasonable and I think we should be grateful to be able to receive the vaccine at all in the first place!</p>

<p>In braving the long lineups for the flu shot, I can see why it takes so ridiculously long. The organizers are clueless as to how to move people efficiently.</p>
<p>Instead of having patients line up inside the room, a few feet from the nurses, they have them out in the hallway--40 feet away--and only call people in after a nurse puts up her card indicating that she can take someone. This takes almost one minute per patient. If a few patients were allowed to wait in the room, the transit time would be reduced to a few seconds. People are standing anyway; why not have them closer to the service point?</p>
<p>There is also no triage as people enter the line. They wait for half an hour or more, only to find out that they are in the wrong line up and have to go the registration desk to get a form. Is it really that hard to put up signs that say "This line if you have the H1N1 form," and "This line to get the H1N1 form."</p>
<p>I pointed these simple solutions out to the woman in charge, but she did nothing. So much for Alberta Health Services wanting to "'improve" things.</p>

<p>Vegreville's first H1N1 clinic was scheduled to run from 1-7 p.m. Wednesday. I expected a crowd, so planned to arrive at 3 p.m. I hadn't even parked, when I was told the clinic had run out of the vaccine.</p>
<p>I called my MLA--Ed Stelmach-- the public health office, my doctor's office, and visited two pharmacies. I was told to wait until the next clinic, on Nov. 5. Nobody could tell me if more vaccine would be available, whether there would be another clinic or whether the doctor's office or pharmacy would be able to provide a shot. As well, none of the health-care workers had received shots.</p>
<p>I often disagree with Liberal Leader David Swann. But today, we agree. Health Minister Ron Liepert's "apology" is worthless. We live in one of the richest provinces in one of the richest countries of the world. It is shameful that our government cannot provide a basic public health service.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone involved with the vaccinations at Bonnie Doon Mall.</p>
<p>I arrived at 8:45 a.m. Wednesday, and had my H1N1 vaccination in one hour and 45 minutes. While I was in line, staff members passed out information packages and answered questions. I even saw one woman assist a mother with three young children with an unexpected trip to bathroom.</p>
<p>I also saw several pregnant women and seniors with mobility or respiratory difficulties being moved ahead in line. As a young woman with grandparents with mobility and breathing problems, this was comforting. The nurse who gave me the shot also took a couple of minutes to discuss possible side effects.</p>
<p>To everyone complaining about the wait times and lack of nurses at the vaccination clinics, go early, bring a book, and stop taking your frustrations out on the nurses and other staff. It's not fair to those who are trying very hard to help as many people as possible.</p>

</p>
<p>Why is it so difficult to find comparative flu statistics spanning a number of years? The public has to rely on what the government and media are reporting about the severity of this year's H1N1 flu "pandemic."</p>
<p>You often see H1N1 reported as a "deadly" pandemic. However, I have yet to find any reliable statistics showing that H1N1 is anymore severe than other year's flu season.</p>
<p>The most reliable information I have found was on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website. This site shows that the mortality rate for H1N1 compared to all deaths is no greater than any other year and is, in fact, substantially lower than 2008.</p>
<p>Hasn't Australia already gone through the "second wave" of H1N1? Their population of 21 million recorded 186 deaths due to H1N1. Canada, with a population of 33 million has experienced 91 deaths due to H1N1. How do these stats stack up to previous years?</p>
<p>It is understandable that governments would want to err on the side of caution when it comes to a potential pandemic. But standing on the rooftops and shouting "deadly pandemic" is hardly cautionary. More like inflammatory.</p>
<p>The public relies on the media to provide accurate and timely information. The media have certainly failed in this instance. Deaths attributed to H1N1 are given top billing.</p>
<p>It is tragic when anyone dies due to flu complications, although it should not be unexpected. Thousands of people die from the flu every year. Many of those have other underlying health issues.</p>
<p>To be fair, on Wednesday The Journal ran an article headlined "Separating fact from fiction on H1N1," which stated that the H1N1 flu is no worse than the regular flu for healthy people. All I ask is that the media provide the public with the information required to allow them to make informed decisions.</p>

<p>Re: "Lower risk groups clog lineups for H1N1 shots," by Earle Snider and Debra Ward, Letters, Oct. 28.</p>
<p>I take exception to the letters from Earle Snider and Debra Ward saying that low-risk groups such as seniors are clogging up the lineups for the H1N1 flu shots.</p>
<p>The criteria listed by Alberta Health Services for getting the shots early included people who had a chronic health condition, regardless of age. Many seniors have one or more of these chronic conditions: diabetes, lung problems, cancer, kidney problems, heart conditions, asthma, high blood pressure, etc.</p>
<p>I doubt very much that seniors who have been in the lineups the last two or three days did not have some form of a chronic condition.</p>
<p>We should not generalize with such a broad brush that paints all seniors as "rushing to the front of the line" for no apparent reason, other than to get their flu shot first.</p>

<p>Wednesday, my mom and I went to the mall again, to try to get our H1N1 shots. Again, we were told at the door that clinic was closed because there were too many people.</p>
<p>Last week, I got my seasonal flu shot. It took 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I was told that people who get priority for the H1N1 shots are students, people who work in schools, and people with certain health conditions. If students should be getting the shots, would it not be better to have the shots given in schools?</p>
<p>My school is crawling with kids who have H1N1. I don't feel safe going to school. I know at least 10 students who have gone home sick.</p>
<p>But every time I try to get vaccinated, security guards turn me away.</p>
<p>In many households, including my own, people do not get home until the supper hour due to work and school, so there is no chance of getting to a flu clinic early enough to have a spot in line. If could, I would line up outside the clinic at 6:30 a.m. Unfortunately, at that time, I am on my way to school.</p>

<p>Re: "Province to ease flu-shot wait; Health minister publicly apologizes for long lineups," The Journal, Oct. 28.</p>
<p>We have now endured almost a week of long lines, crowded and poorly ventilated "health" sites were we can receive our H1N1 immunization.</p>
<p>The vaccine is free, as are the infectious materials that we get from the other hundreds standing in line. After months of planning, we are here --only a few sites to go to to receive "all" of this.</p>
<p>In previous years, hundreds of doctors' across the province were able to get and administer the flu vaccine. We also had many community locations, and this year have available hundreds of pharmacists who are able to administer these injections.</p>
<p>It must have taken some brilliant thinking to find reasons to exclude these many hundreds of locations, in favour of a select few. No wonder patients are hesitant about "health information" coming from a government source. Shameful planning!</p>

<p>A consumer advocate on Thursday warned senators to disregard a lobbying blitz against the government's consumer-product safety bill, because the group spearheading the campaign circulates conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Testifying at a Senate committee studying the bill, Rick Smith, executive director of Environmental Defence, said the consumer-protection plan is "light years better than what Canada has at the moment." He called on senators to "get a move on and pass this bill as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Smith also cautioned them to ignore the pressure from the Canadian Coalition for Health Freedom, by highlighting the group's connection to conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>The coalition, affiliated with Friends of Freedom International, is currently circulating on its website a news release that says: "Drug cartel exposed creating, releasing, injecting, infecting and depopulating planet with pandemic H1N1/H5N1 viruses and vaccines."</p>
<p>The drug cartel's "geopolitical, economic and population reduction activities" are also linked to the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center, according to material posted on the website.</p>
<p>The legislation has already won the unanimous backing of MPs, and will become law if the Senate passes it. The coalition is lobbying the upper chamber, saying the bill gives government inspectors too much power over businesses. Those arguments, delivered in direct meetings with senators and in thousands of e-mails, have been echoed by some Liberal senators. The legislation can only become law if Liberal senators get behind the bill, because they hold a majority in the Senate.</p>
<p>Joseph Day, the Liberal critic for the consumer-product safety bill in the Senate, met with the group's managing director, Trueman Tuck, when he came to Ottawa as part of the group's lobby campaign.</p>
<p>But Day says his concerns about the "intrusive way of dealing with product safety" and the bill's "heavy-handed approach to a problem" were not a result of Tuck's lobby campaign.</p>
<p>"I'm not getting any information from that campaign that's moving me. Any points that he had made, I had already been on top of, so I guess that's why he's suggesting he's pleased with what he's hearing from some Liberal senators, because we independently came to the same conclusions," Day said of Tuck in an interview Thursday.</p>
<p>Later, in response to Smith's criticism of Tuck's lobby campaign during the Senate hearings, Day came to the group's defence.</p>
<p>"We typically don't put down... other potential witnesses that are not here to defend themselves. So when we've talked about certain people who might have sent e-mails and messages, I think it's incumbent upon us now, since they've been described as loony people, to have an opportunity to be here and to represent themselves," Day told members of the Senate's social affairs committee.</p>
<p>Tuck said between 30 and 40 per cent of his group would consider themselves "hard-core" conspiracy theorists, but Tuck does not promote these ideas when he lobbies politicians in Ottawa because, "If I use extreme words, they think I'm a nutcase."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Homeless Calgarians begin receiving H1N1 vaccination</b>
</div><div>Colette Derworiz   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>451 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Homeless Calgarians are rolling up their sleeves for the H1N1 vaccine, as the province's mass immunization plans begin at shelters across Calgary.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services-- through its Safeworks program, a team of community nurses that works with high-risk populations in shelters --held its first clinic Thursday afternoon at the Mustard Seed's Foothills shelter.</p>
<p>It will continue the clinics today at the Calgary Drop-In Centre and the Salvation Army's Centre of Hope.</p>
<p>Basil Smith, who has been homeless for about a year, said it's important for everyone to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>"It's protection," he said. "You go to the library, there's a large population of people. You go on the C-Train, there's a large population of people. It doesn't matter where you go--and not everybody covers their mouth when they cough."</p>
<p>But, similar to the general population, not everyone at the shelter was lining up for the vaccine.</p>
<p>"I don't trust it," said David Helfrick. "I am always healthy and I only get sick every two years, so I figure I don't know what's in it and I don't trust it.</p>
<p>"I figure I'll take my chances and, if it kills me, oh well."</p>
<p>Another client, however, said he hopes everybody at the shelter gets the vaccine.</p>
<p>"It decreases the chances of anyone getting sick, because the virus wouldn't spread," said 30-year-old Adrian Parkin, who arrived at the shelter three days ago. "There's a wide variety of illnesses out there.</p>
<p>"People who live in close communities like this one have an increased risk of getting sick."</p>
<p>Calgary's deputy chief medical officer of health said all homeless Calgarians are encouraged to get the shot.</p>
<p>"The homeless population is a group that is vulnerable to infection--not unlike others," said Dr. Judy MacDonald, noting they are more vulnerable because they live in close quarters, can have underlying health conditions and are less likely to access health care.</p>
<p>MacDonald said the clinics are being run by public health nurses who work in the shelters daily and are simply providing the H1N1 shot as an additional service.</p>
<p>Tim Richter, president of the Calgary Homeless Foundation, added it's important to offer the vaccine on site at the shelters.</p>
<p>"They are unique in that they are harder to inoculate," he said of the homeless.</p>

<p>Daily we are reminded how important it is to get an H1N1 flu shot. What about the Canadians with egg allergies? What options do we have?</p>
<p>There are hundreds of us who cannot take this shot due to the fact influenza vaccines are produced in an egg-based process. Is it not possible to create an influenza vaccine that is not grown in eggs? Then, every Canadian would have the chance to be protected.</p>

<p>Re: "Calgarians flood clinic for flu shots," Oct. 27.</p>
<p>A six-hour wait will definitely keep me from getting the H1N1 vaccination, free or not. I can book an appointment to get an oil change for my car, if I want, or I can drive up and wait. I can book an appointment to see my doctor, if I have one, or go to a walk-in clinic without an appointment and wait my turn. I can book an appointment to get my blood test done, or I can go to the lab without an appointment and just wait my turn. Why don't I have the option to book an appointment to get a flu shot? I suspect that more Calgarians would partake if this were the case.</p>

<p>I would like to pass on a huge thank-you to all the front-line staff and health nurses working at the H1N1 clinics. I waited at the Brentwood clinic for two hours and despite a never-ending queue, frustrated adults and crying children, they are doing their jobs with immense patience and are still managing to smile. Keep up the excellent work.</p>

</p>
<p>Calgary started out this week with four H1N1 vaccination clinics to serve a population of more than one million people, with wait times stretching to four and five hours. A fifth clinic was later added at the Olympic Oval for seniors, small children and pregnant women, all of whom might have trouble standing for such long waiting periods.</p>
<p>That's still not enough, and Calgarians have every right to know why receiving a flu shot in this city is as time-consuming as lining up for the last few loaves of bread at a Soviet-era grocery store. Winnipeg has 12 clinics serving a population of 650,000 and Heidi Graham, spokesperson for the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, said that "the longest (wait)we've heard about . . . has been 90 minutes. Where there is a wait, it's usually about an hour."</p>
<p>Something is wrong with this picture, and it's up to Alberta Health Services to bring it into much sharper focus.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert's feeble excuses just don't wash. Liepert said the government was caught off guard by the number of people who flocked to the vaccination clinics. But why should there be any element of unpreparedness?The government has been urging everyone to get a shot, yet it professes to be surprised when a fraction of those people do just what the government told them to.</p>
<p>Liepert also deflected blame for the lineups to the vaccine's early delivery coupled with problems putting medical staff in place and training them. But why weren't staffing logistics and training dealt with a long time ago? H1N1 did not suddenly appear; provincial officials knew months ago that the second wave was expected to arrive this fall. Nor did the Manitoba government seem to have any problem, either with vaccine delivery or with staffing and training personnel for the 12 Winnipeg clinics.</p>
<p>If Calgarians stay away in droves from the vaccination clinics because of their unwillingness to spend half a day standing in a lineup, the government will have only itself to blame. This organized chaos can only be the direct result of inexcusably poor planning. Manitoba got it right, and Alberta had the same opportunity. Liepert has said, "We're going to work toward making sure that we take corrective action." That should be unnecessary, Mr. Minister. Fine-tuning--such as making flu response units staffed by paramedics available for house calls to those Calgarians uncertain about their condition-- is acceptable;a major course correction is not.</p>
<p>It's also unacceptable that the lineups are being further clogged by people who were specifically asked to wait for their shots until those in high-risk groups--including those under 65 with chronic conditions and pregnant women --receive theirs in the early days of the vaccination program. Those who are not at high risk should wait until the vaccine is made available through doctors' offices and select pharmacists.</p>
<p>Vaccination clinics will open next week on college and university campuses, and clinics to assess people with flu symptoms will also open. In the end, it can only be hoped that the government's mismanagement does not have the effect of helping the pandemic to spread by inducing people to stay away from vaccination clinics, and that health officials take to heart the lessons learned so they can get it right next time.</p>

</p>
<p>As absentee rates climb among city police and firefighters, the man in charge of the City of Calgary's response to the swine flu pandemic is frustrated enough to consider hiring a private health-care company to administer the H1N1 vaccine to staff on the front lines -- if he could get any.</p>
<p>Tom Sampson, deputy chief of the Calgary Emergency Management Agency, believes first responders and other essential services workers should be allowed to join health-care workers at the front of the line for the vaccine. He said he's been asking Alberta Health Services for access to the vaccine since Oct. 19.</p>
<p>"Regretfully, I've yet to be able to secure any vaccine, although we have a provider who's prepared to administer it for us who's separate from the health system," said Sampson.</p>
<p>"Our position is, if you give us the vaccine, we will administer it our own staff.</p>
<p>"We looked at the long lineups that started this week and, realistically, we can't put 4,000 essential services staff into those lineups. It's not good use of taxpayers' money."</p>
<p>The absentee rate in the Calgary Police Service has doubled, said Sampson, and tripled in the Calgary Fire Department.</p>
<p>"We think it's prudent timing now to implement a vaccination program for those essential personnel within the City of Calgary--those people who keep the core of our city operating."</p>
<p>He's been told that may not happen until the second week of November.</p>
<p>For now, essential service workers will have to get in line with the public at the mass immunization clinics, said Sheila Rougeau, a spokesperson for Alberta Health Services.</p>
<p>"First responders, whether that be EMS, fire or police and other essential workers . . . are all important, and we are working very hard to immunize as people we can, as quickly we can," said Rougeau.</p>
<p>"It's only because we have to balance the resources and the vaccine supply that we currently have, which is why we can't expand on the program right now."</p>
<p>Since Monday, doctors, nurses and other health-care workers have been first in line for H1N1 flu shots at four city hospital clinics.</p>
<p>Open from 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., they're exclusively for health-care workers, said Mac-Donald. Their family members are not allowed.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, 14,744 health-care workers had been vaccinated; 38,000 across Alberta.</p>
<p>AHS has approximately 90,000 health care workers.</p>
<p>Until Wednesday, one group of health-care providers new to the AHS fold didn't realize it could access staff clinics.</p>
<p>Some of Calgary's 500 paramedics and emergency medical technicians had been standing in line at mass immunization clinics, or getting shots in hospital when they brought in patients, said Rick Fraser, head of CUPE Local 3421, the union that represents them.</p>
<p>"Part of the problem has been the transition of EMS from the City of Calgary and other municipalities into Alberta Health Services. It's also the transitioning of how we communicate internally," he explained.</p>
<p>"Because EMS are now considered health-care providers, they are one of the priority groups that we want to get vaccinated as quickly as possible," said Rougeau.</p>

</p>
<p>Vancouver Centre MP Hedy Fry said Thursday that Parliament Hill should have its own H1N1 clinic.</p>
<p>"There should be a clinic on the hill for all the workers that are at risk," Fry said. "MPs are at risk -- we shake hands with people I don't know how many times a day."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canadians can expect a longer wait for the vaccine after the federal government warned provinces and territories they will be getting less of the vaccine over the next few weeks than had been anticipated.</p>
<p>The federal government said it was informed by Canada's H1N1 vaccine manufacturer, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, that vaccine supply will be lower next week because its facility only has one production line for two types of vaccine.</p>
<p>In B.C., the manufacturing delay forced the Centre for Disease Control to reduce the number of vaccines available for health authorities, meaning not everyone in at-risk groups will be inoculated as soon as planned.</p>
<p>Fry, who practised family medicine before entering politics, has criticized the federal government's handling of the country's H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>"Health care workers are turning away at-risk patients as they ration the people that need to be vaccinated, but poor planning and vaccine shortages have put us in an unacceptable position where there aren't enough vaccines for everyone," Fry said in a press release.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Death of woman, 52, leaves Newboro in shock; 'She had asthma, but it was controlled'</b>
</div><div>Tony Lofaro   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>427 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>The death of a 52-year-old Newboro woman of H1N1 flu virus has left this community southwest of Ottawa in shock.</p>
<p>Karin Shiozaki was a well-known respiratory technologist who worked alongside her husband, Dr. Ian Kent Shiozaki, at his practice on John Street in Newboro. She died Oct. 19 at the Kingston General Hospital about a week after she was admitted complaining of shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Her death came before a 10-year-old Cornwall girl succumbed to the virus last weekend at CHEO.</p>
<p>"She had asthma, but it was controlled," said Shiozaki, 55, in an interview Thursday night.</p>
<p>"Basically, I think what happened was that even though she was starting to improve over the week that she was in hospital she probably had a second infection on top of what she had and it just sent her in shock ... then she went.</p>
<p>"It's been devastating, we were best friends," said Shiozaki who returned to work only five days ago.</p>
<p>The couple were married for 33 years and have two children Jesse, 21 and Alix, 19. They are both originally from Toronto and settled in Newboro in 1981 where he opened a general practice.</p>
<p>"The kids are taking it pretty rough, they were very close to their mother."</p>
<p>He said the night before his wife died she appeared to be getting better, but then things took a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>"They were taking her off her medications and decreasing the amount of ventilation she needed because she had been on a (ventilation) machine for the last week. But then they called me in the middle of the night and said they couldn't keep her blood pressure up and she was crashing." Shiozaki said the medical staff did everything they could for his wife while she was in hospital.</p>
<p>Shiozaki said his wife was in reasonably good health, although he admitted she had packed on a few extra pounds in recent years.</p>
<p>"She was a little overweight. She sort of fit into that relatively young female obese (picture). Obesity seems to play a part in this," he said.</p>
<p>His wife had general symptoms such as coughing and malaise that then led to a shortness of breath, he said. She was put on a ventilation machine and administered medication to combat the virus.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pediatric Tamiflu not easy to come by, parents find; Compounding pharmacies able to help out</b>
</div><div>Maria Cook   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>443 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Early</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Some doctors are prescribing a liquid form of Tamiflu, an anti-viral drug, to treat the youngest victims of the H1N1 pandemic. But a shortage of a syrup used to make the children's formula has forced some Ottawa parents to hunt from pharmacy to pharmacy.</p>
<p>The drug can make the flu milder and go away more quickly and may cut the risk of potentially life-threatening complications if taken within 48 hours.</p>
<p>Thomas Hayes, chair of an emergency-planning committee for area hospitals and nursing homes, said Thursday there is no shortage of Tamiflu in capsule form in Ottawa drugstores or hospitals. Capsules are for adults and older children.</p>
<p>"The province has a supply of Tamiflu stockpiled for a pandemic and other anti-virals as well," says Hayes. Supplies are currently on their way to pharmacies.</p>
<p>But the ready-made liquid form of the medicine used for young children has become hard to come by. And now, there is a shortage of a syrup called Ora-Sweet used by pharmacists to mix an alternative formula from adult capsules.</p>
<p>Wayne Law, pharmacist and owner of Kanata Pharmasave, says he bought Tamiflu on Thursday from a wholesaler. "The government stock is going out (but) it's not going to all the stores yet. It's a huge undertaking."</p>
<p>Ora-Sweet is back-ordered and expected in a couple of weeks, said Law.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Minneapolis-based Paddock Laboratories, which makes Ora-Sweet, said "we're manufacturing as quickly as we can. We've been shipping to Canada as of last week."</p>
<p>Hayes says other readily available solutions can be used, called Ora-Plus and PCCA Plus.</p>
<p>"It's not difficult for a pharmacist to prepare that solution in a pediatric format," says Hayes. "The information is available from CHEO (the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario) and other hospital pharmacies on how to do that."</p>
<p>Claudia McKeen, pharmacist at the Glebe Apothecary, said CHEO has been sending parents to her.</p>
<p>She said not every pharmacy has the ingredients to make the alternative. "Parents have to find a compounding pharmacy," she said, one where a pharmacist has the expertise and resources to make custom medications.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, pharmacies that advertise compounding services include McKeen's on Bank Street, NutriChem Compounding Pharmacy on Richmond Road and Desjardins Pharmacy on Dalhousie Street; parents who are prescribed liquid Tamiflu for their children should ask their doctors for other recommendations or check with their regular pharmacists.</p>
<p>Hayes stressed that Tamiflu should not be used across the board.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Logistics, high demand plague shots: official; Medical services director says no one expected so big a turnout</b>
</div><div>Dave Rogers   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>758 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Early</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Logistical problems and heavy demand for flu vaccine are responsible for the difficulties that have plagued the H1N1 vaccination program in Gatineau, the director of medical services for the Outaouais said Thursday.</p>
<p>Dr. Guy Morissette, the Quebec government official responsible for Outaouais health services, said hundreds of people were turned away from Gatineau's only vaccination clinic open on Wednesday, at Les Promenades de l'Outaouais, because no one expected so many people would line up for a flu shot.</p>
<p>"Money is not a problem -- it is the logistics of having health-care workers ready to vaccinate, getting the sites ready for people and making sure that parking spaces are available," Morissette said. "It was planned to start the mass vaccination program on Nov. 15 in the Outaouais and in December in Montreal. But if we can get the sites ready by next week, we will open them then."</p>
<p>A second clinic opened Thursday at a geriatric day centre at 455 Montée Paiement because of the demand for vaccine. Health-care workers, women who are more than 20 weeks pregnant and children between six months and five years of age are the only people being vaccinated until Nov. 9.</p>
<p>That's when two much larger clinics are supposed to open, at Place Cartier on Saint-Joseph Boulevard and a new location at Les Promenades de l'Outaouais.</p>
<p>"We will be able to administer 350 doses of vaccine per hour at each of the two sites when they are ready on Nov. 9," Morissette said. The two clinics will be able to vaccinate about 1,500 people a day compared to 700 at the start of the Gatineau vaccination campaign on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Morissette said the provincial government planned to vaccinate 15,000 Outaouais health workers first when vaccine became available on Monday. He said a decision by Gatineau health workers to do more than was expected by giving flu shots to pregnant women and young children led to chaos.</p>
<p>People from as far away as Thurso began lining up at Les Promenades de l'Outaouais at 5 a.m. Clinic staff told anyone who arrived after 9 a.m. to return another day because the clinic had reached its capacity of about 600 patients.</p>
<p>Morissette said the Outaouais health service already has 50,000 doses of vaccine, but that nurses can't yet administer the flu shot as quickly as the public expects. The staff needed for the vaccination program are now working at outpatient clinics and will have to be shifted to new responsibilities.</p>
<p>Morissette said health officials couldn't prepare mass vaccination centres earlier because they didn't know exactly when H1N1 vaccine would become available.</p>
<p>"We couldn't predict at what time the flu would strike and when the vaccine would be ready," Morissette said. "We were surprised that the demand for vaccine is so high because usually only 25 per cent of the population wants to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>"At the most we get 40 per cent of health-care workers getting the vaccine. But the figures we are getting show that 70 to 80 per cent of health-care workers will be vaccinated, which is double of what we expected."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Full-scale public vaccinations to begin Nov. 9</p>
<p>The public vaccination campaign for those who are not at high risk of complications from the virus is set to start Nov. 9 in most parts of the Outaouais, and to continue until late December or mid-January.</p>
<p>Until then, the small first Gatineau vaccination site at Les Promenades de l'Outaouais will administer flu shots from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Monday to Friday.</p>
<p>The second Gatineau site, the geriatric day centre at 455 Montée Paiement, will be open from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday to Friday.</p>
<p>Both sites will be open from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Family doctors likely to wait weeks for doses; Stumbling blocks include packaging, paperwork and overall supply</b>
</div><div>Kate Jaimet   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>837 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Early</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Family doctors are eager to start vaccinating patients with the H1N1 shot, but Ottawa's medical officer of health cautioned that it will probably take a few weeks before that option is available to supplement the swamped city-run clinics.</p>
<p>"It's unlikely we'll have the supply in hand, or packaged in a way that we can do that, in a week or two," Dr. Isra Levy said at a press briefing Thursday.</p>
<p>Those words are disappointing to Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, president of the Academy of Medicine Ottawa, which represents 1,000 doctors. She said she still hopes the vaccine will be available to family physicians beginning next week.</p>
<p>"I hope it could come tomorrow. There are lots of family physicians who are clamouring for this. I know their patients want it," she said. "The physicians I speak to are very concerned, especially with the inclement weather, and people lining up outside (of city-run immunization clinics)."</p>
<p>Currently, all flu shots for the general public are being administered at mass immunization clinics set up by Ottawa Public Health. The unexpected demand, especially after two Ontario youngsters died of H1N1 this week, has led to lineups several hours long and people being turned away, even though they arrive during the clinics' scheduled operating hours.</p>
<p>Originally, Ottawa Public Health had expected to be the sole provider of flu shots for the initial stages of the campaign, bringing in other providers after two or three weeks. But with the heavy demand, Levy decided this week to speed the process.</p>
<p>First, hospitals were given 5,000 doses to inoculate their staff. Then on Wednesday, the public-health agency invited applications for vials of H1N1 vaccine from:</p>
<p>- primary care providers including family doctors and nurse practitioners,</p>
<p>- community care access centres providing home-care to the frail and elderly,</p>
<p>- long-term care facilities,</p>
<p>- Correctional Services, and</p>
<p>- aboriginal access centres.</p>
<p>The decision to favour mass clinics in the early going came about because of decisions at the provincial health ministry, not Ottawa Public Health, Fullerton said.</p>
<p>Fullerton said two initial stumbling blocks made it difficult for family doctors to participate in the vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>First, the initial shipments of vaccine from the province arrived in Ottawa in boxes of 500 doses. That's too many doses for an ordinary doctor's practice to use up in a timely manner, she said.</p>
<p>That concern is now being addressed by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, which will begin sending out the vaccine packaged in 100-dose boxes next week, ministry spokesman David Jensen said Thursday.</p>
<p>"If they can actually get the vaccine quantities down to 100, it's entirely possible a group of physicians (in the same building) could divide that up and use that in their office," Fullerton said.</p>
<p>The second stumbling block was the paperwork associated with the flu shot, Fullerton said. Since both the virus and the vaccine are new, the ministry initially wanted doctors to record and compile a large amount of demographic data about the people receiving the vaccine and send it to the province weekly. That was overwhelming for most practices, she said.</p>
<p>"I can understand why they would have wanted to do all of these things, but at some point you have to decide, is it more important to get the vaccine out as soon as you can, or to have all sorts of paperwork for future scrutiny?"</p>
<p>Although doctors had been telling the ministry as far back as last summer that the paperwork was too onerous, it's only in the past few days that the ministry has replaced the reams of paperwork with a one-page form for doctors to fill out, Fullerton said.</p>
<p>"I'm fairly sure that significant numbers of family physicians are going to want to give that vaccine, now that the bureaucratic obstacles have been lifted," Fullerton said. "I think you'll see a good uptake and I think you'll see patients happier getting the shot in their doctors' offices."</p>
<p>Dr. Christine Rivet, a family doctor at the Family Medicine Centre at The Ottawa Hospital's Civic campus, said she hopes to begin administering flu shots next week.</p>
<p>But Levy cautioned the supply in Ottawa may be too scarce for distribution to doctors' offices in the immediate future.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, Ottawa had received 83,500 doses of the vaccine that goes by the trade name Arepanrix. By Wednesday night, 22,400 doses had been used. Levy said on Thursday that Ottawa could temporarily run out of the vaccine by Sunday night, although a new shipment is expected in the next few days.</p>

</div><div>Compiled by Joanne Laucius   </div>

<div>817 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>

<p>Parents wondering whether it's safe to let their little ghosts and goblins go trick-or-treating have nothing to worry about, as long as they take reasonable precautions, says Canada's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David butler-jones. Here are the answers to some other questions you may have before Saturday night.</p>
<p>For parents of young children, H1N1 might be the scariest thing about Halloween this year.</p>
<p>But even Canada's chief medical officer of health says there's no reason to let flu fears spoil the fun. As long as adults take reasonable precautions, Dr. David Butler-Jones says there's no reason to lock up the ghosts and goblins. Keep their hands clean and make sure they don't share drinking glasses if they go to parties.</p>
<p>If a child is ill, he or she should be kept home. Yes, it will make you unpopular, but there are alternatives. Consider asking other children to trick-or-treat for them, Butler-Jones suggests.</p>
<p>"Finding other ways so that kids can enjoy Halloween even if they're ill without actually having to go out there, I think is one way to address it."</p>
<p>What should I do if I'm handing out treats?</p>
<p>If you are the one at the door in charge of the candy bowl, hand candy out yourself instead of allowing children to put their hands in the bowl. Make sure all treats are wrapped.</p>
<p>Should I wear a surgical mask if I'm handing out treats?</p>
<p>Only if your goal is to scare children. Health Canada does not recommend that members of the general public use surgical masks to protect themselves from contracting H1N1. You run the risk of contaminating yourself when putting on and taking off a surgical mask, and actually increase the risk of getting infected. The exception to this is people who are displaying flu-like symptoms. If this is you, you should not be handing out treats at the door.</p>
<p>What should parents do?</p>
<p>Bring some hand sanitizer with you when you're going from door to door, and remind children to keep their hands away from their eyes, noses and mouths.</p>
<p>What about Halloween masks?</p>
<p>Even without H1N1, makeup is safer than masks, which can make it hard for children to see. But physicians have pointed out the dangers of trying on masks in a store before Halloween. You can be infected if the H1N1 virus is introduced into a hospitable environment such as the eyes, nose or mouth. That includes the surfaces of a mask that are pressed against a child's face.</p>
<p>If you do choose a mask and bring it home, be sure to clean it thoroughly before anyone wears it.</p>
<p>What about going to Halloween parties?</p>
<p>Stay away if you have flu-like symptoms -- fever and cough are the giveaways,</p>
<p>especially combined with body aches, a sore throat, or a runny nose. Public-health officials are counting on vigilant parents to help prevent the spread of H1N1. But Health Canada says it is important for healthy people to continue their daily lives during the pandemic, including going to community events. In crowded situations, take extra precautions such as frequent handwashing. Make sure children practise cough etiquette -- cough into their elbows, not their hands -- and avoid communal bowls.</p>
<p>Are big public celebrations doing anything different?</p>
<p>Rideau Hall has its annual spooky village planned, running from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday night. "It's an outdoor event," said spokeswoman Julie Rocheleau. "We're not really making any change."</p>
<p>Anything else to avoid?</p>
<p>Bobbing for apples is definitely a no-no this year.</p>
<p>Any final words?</p>
<p>Don't forget to take the usual precautions to keep children safe when they're trick-or-treating, including making sure costumes are visible to motorists and children are supervised while trick-or-treating. Discard any unwrapped candy for general safety reasons as well as preventing H1N1 infection.</p>
<p>There are a number of documented risks around Halloween that have nothing to do with H1N1, ranging from eye injuries caused by thrown eggs to cases of diarrhea connected to over-indulgence in candy containing sorbitol. But the biggest Halloween risk is probably the danger of being struck by a car or another vehicle. According to a report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, children are four times more likely to be struck by cars on Halloween than on other nights.</p>
<p>Photo: Greg Southam, Canwest News Service / Some simple
precautions can ensure that your little ones are safer as they hit
the streets to go trick-or-treating Saturday night, including
bringing hand sanitizer along from the night and ensuring that they
don't touch their eyes, noses or mouths.

</p>
<p>The H1N1 swine flu outbreak is changing people's behaviour in big and small ways as the city struggles to stem the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>From personal hygiene, to how we worship, play and interact with one another, H1N1 is changing some of our age-old habits and traditions in a manner we could hardly imagine a year ago.</p>
<p>In churches across the city, priests and parishioners alike are readjusting to new and strange practices. Roman Catholics no longer offer their hands in the traditional greeting of peace. Instead, parishioners bow or acknowledge one another in other ways. During communion, when the cup is freely offered to all comers, it is now offered only to the priest.</p>
<p>"Until the (H1N1) threat is over, only the priest will be receiving the wine from the cup," said Msgr. Pat Powers, the director of the Notre Dame Cathedral Basilica.</p>
<p>As well, the well-worn tradition of having priests shake the hands of parishioners at the door as they leave mass has been stopped. Powers said the only thing that has not changed is the giving of holy water. The practice will stop if the H1N1 threat worsens.</p>
<p>Powers said Wednesday the changes have been made in response to H1N1 and for the good of the community.</p>
<p>"Notre Dame is Ottawa's largest and oldest church and many thousands of people come through here every day. In addition to having older people who may have immunity problems, we also have younger people. We've all agreed that we don't want to transmit the virus," he said. "We have established a policy here and everybody agrees and understands that this is the way it should be."</p>
<p>Canon Bill Prentice, the Anglican diocese's director of parish and diocesan services, said the diocese is also adapting to the threat of the swine flu: "We are encouraging people with regards to shifting from shaking hands to bumping fists, tapping elbows and embracing each other."</p>
<p>The diocese has not changed its policy on receiving communion, but Anglican bishops are meeting next week and the issue may be discussed. In the meantime, Prentice said parishioners can choose not to dip the bread into the wine. Those who are uncomfortable with receiving the cup can take the bread alone, he said.</p>
<p>The changes taking place are not just in the churches.</p>
<p>On playgrounds and places where people congregate, bowing and bumping fists and chests is now the norm. Across the city, people no longer cough in each other's faces, but into their sleeves. In hockey arenas where tykes or professionals play, hand-shaking is out.</p>
<p>Following the sudden death from swine flu of a 13-year-old Mississauga minor hockey player, the Ottawa District Minor Hockey Association is reviewing its safety procedures. President Mike Depratto said: "We are telling players not to shake hands and to do so only with their gloves on. And they should not borrow or lend towels."</p>
<p>He said parents have been advised to make sure their children get plenty of rest, but to keep them at home at the slightest sign of illness. He said every child is already</p>
<p>required to have a personal water bottle and the practice will be reinforced. Depratto said the association is in the middle of discussions on what circumstances would require the cancellation of games.</p>
<p>In colleges and universities across the city, officials are seeing an increase in the number of swine flu cases.</p>
<p>"It was fairly flat in September, but now we are seeing an acceleration of the numbers. In the first of two weeks of October, we saw a steady climb in the numbers," said Michael Histed, the University of Ottawa's director of risk management. "We have a handle on it and we are working with the city to get a flu clinic on campus if we can."</p>
<p>The university reported about 20 flu cases as of Tuesday.</p>
<p>Carleton University says five students in residence are now in isolation due to flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>At Algonquin College, three staff members have confirmed cases of H1N1, while one student is sick with the flu. And at Cité Collégiale, officials say less than one per cent of the student population has flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Despite the scare, area malls are doing good business. Cindy VanBuskirk, general manager of the Rideau Centre, said traffic rose one per cent in September, while sales jumped nine per cent. Things are also looking good at Bayshore. General manager Denis Pelletier says the opening of four new stores in the last month has boosted business considerably. He said traffic was up four per cent</p>
<p>in September, while sales climbed 2.5 per cent.</p>
<p>"Traffic is good, business is good and we hope this scare is just that: a scare," he said.</p>

</p>
<p>First times, we remember -- especially when they marry innocence and death.</p>
<p>Bunny Warner, 67, strides across the crimson carpet in the faux-painted funeral home and extends his hand, poking out from the arm of a black wool jacket. "Take as much time as you need."</p>
<p>Today, he buries his grand-daughter, Vanetia, only 10, the area's first young victim from this latest wave of the H1N1 strain of influenza.</p>
<p>Yet, in this sombre moment, does he find grace. "She was a loving, wonderful girl."</p>
<p>Together with the death of a healthy Toronto teen, these two fatalities stabbed fear in the hearts of many parents.</p>
<p>Why? Because -- as caregivers, as protectors -- they seemed to do everything right, yet watched their children die.</p>
<p>"I think if there's one thing the family would tell other parents, it's, 'Make sure your kids get the (vaccine) shot,'" he said.</p>
<p>Vanetia never had the chance.</p>
<p>A retired school board superintendent, Warner took a moment to describe his granddaughter, one of three children born to Cory Warner and his wife, Angela Lazzari.</p>
<p>She was a Grade 5 student at St. Anne Catholic School, which sits in the middle-class Riverdale neighbourhood, just upstream from the old Domtar paper plant, now a pile of rubble.</p>
<p>Inside the lobby of the school, you will find a table which holds a small memorial. There is large photo of Vanetia in pink earrings and you can see the look of the little girl giving way to the assurance of the young woman.</p>
<p>A Bible is open, at the Book of Psalms.</p>
<p>Vanetia was a figure skater. She liked Miley Cyrus and her alter-ego, Hannah Montana, the Mozart of the pre-teen world. A continuous loop of Cyrus music played during Thursday's wake, at Lahaie & Sullivan Funeral Home. The room was packed, surely a testament to the family's standing in the community.</p>
<p>In as much as photos tell a story, here is what we see: a flair for the theatrical. Vanetia peeling apples while wearing a tiara.</p>
<p>A chickadee resting on a pale blue toque she is wearing on a clear winter day. Dressed up and walking like an ancient Egyptian. Bug-eyed sunglasses and a long set of Mardi Gras beads.</p>
<p>On a yellow slide in a bathing suit. On a dock. Wearing a baseball uniform, with a medal around her neck.</p>
<p>Glammed up with red lipstick and eye shadow, about to perform at a fair, public singing being one her favourite pursuits. Smiling with her kitten.</p>
<p>"She won awards at school and it was always for helping other kids," said Warner.</p>
<p>"One of her favourite sayings was: 'If you've got a problem, build a bridge and get over it."</p>
<p>The grandfather briefly described the fear-inducing speed at which the illness progressed last week.</p>
<p>He said Vanetia was suffering from flu-like symptoms and nausea early in the week and stayed home from school. Later in the week, she seem to rally.</p>
<p>"She was teaching us how to dance to this type of music," he said, pointing to the speaker, "on Thursday night."</p>
<p>Later Friday, she took a turn for the worse and Warner said his son took her to the local hospital. She was soon transferred to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario.</p>
<p>Not knowing how ill the child really was, Warner and his wife, Nancy, took an overnight trip Friday, returning home Saturday afternoon to a startling phone call. They rushed to CHEO where Vanetia was now on life support. She died that day.</p>
<p>"Her body just shut down."</p>
<p>It is shockingly reminiscent of the Toronto 13-year-old who died Monday, after playing in a hockey tournament on the preceding weekend.</p>
<p>Vanetia's death has clearly spooked Cornwall, the town of 47,000 about 100 kilometres east of Ottawa.</p>
<p>"You think of the family," said Cécile Sauvé, 70, having a coffee with friends at a downtown mall. "You don't ever think you're going to bury a child."</p>
<p>She and her friend Mary Ashurst, 68, both suffer from respiratory disease and say they will likely get the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available. "I think people are scared. It can happen so fast," said Ashurst.</p>
<p>The Eastern Ontario Health Unit, which covers Cornwall, reports it is receiving hundreds of calls about access to the vaccine.</p>
<p>It is now ramping up its distribution, adding clinics, including an extra one on Sunday. Details are on the unit's website.</p>
<p>It also announced Thursday it will begin immunizing all children 18 and under, a group not targeted in the first priority wave.</p>
<p>Vanetia's funeral is scheduled for 11 a.m. today.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Queensway-Carleton next to open 'flu unit'</b>
</div><div>Louisa Taylor   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>737 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>The Queensway-Carleton Hospital is following the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in opening a separate "flu unit" in its emergency room and imposing restrictions on visitors, as the number of patients arriving with flu-like symptoms rises.</p>
<p>The measures are part of the pandemic plan hospitals have worked on for months and have been rolling out as medical officials realized the second wave of the H1N1 pandemic had arrived in Ottawa, said Thomas Hayes, chairman of the Hospitals Emergency Planning Committee, one of the key pandemic-response groups in the city.</p>
<p>"We've been watching the level of emergency-room activity steadily increase since the beginning of October, and this past week, we saw the CHEO volumes jump," said Hayes, director of occupational health at The Ottawa Hospital.</p>
<p>"They didn't go from normal to double overnight, and it's not a cause for panic," Hayes said. "But if there was a 'We're here' moment, that was it."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, CHEO reported that it had seen more than 300 patients in the previous 24 hours -- double the 150 children it sees on a typical October day. The hospital established a separate isolation unit to treat patients with flu-like symptoms and reduced service in three clinics. Staff were redeployed to the emergency room and the hospital announced it would allow only one adult to accompany a sick child to the emergency department.</p>
<p>Patient levels stayed high all week, prompting CHEO to reduce service at its remaining non-surgical clinics Thursday. Although all non-urgent appointments have been cancelled, "all urgent clinical appointments will absolutely continue to go forward," said CHEO spokeswoman Marie Belanger. "Patients with appointments deemed to be urgent in nature were contacted and advised to follow through on their appointment."</p>
<p>CHEO also has a new H1N1 hotline people can call for information on symptoms, what to expect if they visit the emergency department, what to do if they think a clinic appointment has been postponed, and more. The number is 613-737-7600, ext. 7777.</p>
<p>CHEO has 10 patients with confirmed cases of H1N1 and another 11 suspected cases, Belanger said, up from a total of 15 earlier this week.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, the Queensway-Carleton Hospital had three confirmed H1N1 cases and five suspected cases admitted to hospital. It reported 237 emergency room visits on Wednesday, up from its daily average of 195.</p>
<p>"Effective immediately, we are restricting all visitors from our emergency department," said hospital spokeswoman Judy Brown on Thursday, adding that the exception is one visitor may accompany a child or a frail and elderly patient.</p>
<p>She said the hospital is hoping to open its new flu unit on Monday, in space currently occupied by outpatient services and ambulatory care clinics. Emergency rooms at other area hospitals -- the Civic, the General and the Montfort -- are slightly busier than normal, but not enough to warrant special measures yet.</p>
<p>"Right now it's status quo," said Mary Shore, evening co-ordinator at the Montfort Hospital. "The numbers are slightly higher, but we seem to be okay for now. There's a plan for an expanded unit, but we have yet to make the decision to implement it."</p>
<p>Hayes said his committee of local hospitals, family physicians, paramedics, long-term care providers and home-care centres has numerous committees meeting regularly to share information and co-ordinate their response. Meetings have gone from weekly to every couple of days in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>"Fortunately, the vast majority of cases are mild, and we can expect another couple of weeks of heavy activity and then, we hope, the same thing will happen that we saw in the summer -- it will drop off again, and then we're in December and it's seasonal flu shot time," said Hayes.</p>
<p>While people are spending hours in line at clinics and emergency rooms, those who call their province's telehealth lines could be put on hold because of the high volume of calls.</p>
<p>Ontario's health advice line is now getting five times as many calls -- about 13,000 a day -- than is normal for this time of year. To ease the burden on its health-care infrastructure, Ontario's medical officer urged people to use a self-assessment tool on the government's website to determine whether they need medical advice.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Volchenkov dislocates elbow in Florida game; Goalies' best friend to miss at least two weeks of action</b>
</div><div>Allen Panzeri   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>711 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Given the number of shots that Anton Volchenkov blocks -- 30 in 10 games after Wednesday's 4-3 win over the Florida Panthers -- you'd expect him to be felled by a puck to some part of the body.</p>
<p>However, that wasn't the way the tough Ottawa Senator defenceman was brought down. Volchenkov was knocked out for a least a couple of weeks when 6-2, 195-pound Florida centre Kamil Kreps fell on him in a collision with about four minutes left in the third period.</p>
<p>Kreps fell on Volchenkov's right elbow, dislocating it.</p>
<p>The team won't know exactly how severe the injury is until it returns to Ottawa and Volchenkov undergoes further tests.</p>
<p>"We hope it's only going to be maybe a couple of weeks," coach Cory Clouston said. "We'll wait until we get back and get the MRI. I don't want to say long-term, but it'll probably be a couple of weeks."</p>
<p>Goaltenders Pascal Leclaire and Brian Elliott will miss Volchenkov's defensive game in front of them. "It's a big loss for us," Leclaire said. "He's a goalie's best friend. He'll be really missed, but we have the guys to step up."</p>
<p>Chris Phillips, Volchenkov's defensive partner, echoed those sentiments.</p>
<p>"It's a big injury for us," he said. "We're going to miss him, for sure. He plays a lot of minutes for us."</p>
<p>Volchenkov's injury has opened the door for Brian Lee, who was sent to the the American Hockey League team in Binghamton just before the start of the regular season. Lee was on a 7 a.m. flight out of Binghamton on Thursday, caught a connection in Philadelphia and arrived at the team's hotel in Tampa around 2 p.m.</p>
<p>"I'm excited," he said.</p>
<p>Lee's performance has been inconsistent in Binghamton. In nine games, he had just one goal and three assists.</p>
<p>In other roster moves for the Lightning game, Ryan Shannon was in while Jason Spezza sat. It was a precautionary move because of a slight upper-body injury.</p>
<p>Leclaire improving</p>
<p>The day after pulling himself after the first period, Leclaire said he was feeling much better. He felt fine before Wednesday's game, but as the first period moved on he started to feel dizzy and decided it was "time to get a good goalie in there."</p>
<p>Neither he nor Clouston were concerned that this bout with the flu is anything more than that. None of the players have shown symptoms of the H1N1 virus. If they do, they'll be tested for it.</p>
<p>Burns recovering</p>
<p>On a special Tampa Bay Fights Cancer Night at the St. Pete Times Forum, it was good to see Pat Burns, the former Hull police officer and Olympiques coach, sitting in the press box to watch his first game of the season.</p>
<p>Burns, who lives in Florida for the winter and continues to work for the New Jersey Devils, is recovering from his third fight with cancer.</p>
<p>He has lost 57 pounds -- "Not the ideal way to lose weight," he quipped -- but he looks good and was anxious for news from the Ottawa Valley.</p>
<p>"Say hi to everyone for me," Burns said.</p>
<p>Hello, it's me</p>
<p>The Ottawa Mission found itself with an extra $5,000 on Thursday after Senators centre Mike Fisher won a contest on Hot 89.9.</p>
<p>For a contest called "Is it me?" clues were provided every day since last Friday.</p>
<p>Fisher called the radio station shortly after noon on Thursday and asked, "Is it me?"</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>The final clue at 12:15 was "The Subject is a Country Music Fan!" but the one at 7:15 a.m. might have given it away: "The number 12 is significant to The Subject."</p>
<p>Fisher donated the $5,000 prize to the mission.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hand-to-hand contact is out; National Capital school association takes handshakes out of the games</b>
</div><div>Martin Cleary   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1016 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Post-game handshakes, high-fives and any other form of palm pressing have been banned from all Ottawa high school sports until further notice.</p>
<p>The National Capital Secondary School Athletic Association has told athletic directors and coaches at its 58 member high schools that handshaking is out in order to help stop the spread of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"For everyone's peace of mind, we're trying to do all we can to prevent the spread of germs," association president Cheryl Hyndman said in an interview on Thursday.</p>
<p>"I'm not surprised. We've stopped it (handshaking) at church, as well."</p>
<p>Hyndman got a first-hand look at the new post-game policy Thursday, when she attended the Jackson girls' tier 2 basketball game at St. Francis Xavier Catholic High School. When the game ended, the two teams went to centre court, gave three cheers for the other team and then waved to each other. "It was great. It worked," she said.</p>
<p>The association sent a short e-mail Wednesday about the post-game restriction on handshaking and it also was in full effect at the association's varsity girls' tier 1 and tier 2 field hockey championships Thursday at the Minto Sports Field.</p>
<p>However, hand-to-hand contact certainly wasn't eliminated from the games. Players were regularly hand slapping each other after goals. Excited players celebrated goals with spur-of-the-moment high-fives. In one case, a player took out her protective mouthguard and held it after a goal and a high-five. Instead of shaking hands as a gesture of sportsmanship at the end of the finals, NCSSAA field hockey convenor Kristen Shaw suggested teams line up and tap their curved sticks as they pass each other.</p>
<p>The novel approach worked well as the All Saints and Gloucester players held their sticks high for a light tap after the tier 2 final. The John McCrae and Merivale players kept their sticks low following the tier 1 final.</p>
<p>"I can see why they're doing it, but it seems a little impersonal," said Gloucester's Erin Van Gulik, who scored the only goal in the tier 2 final as the Gators upset the defending champion All Saints Avalanche 1-0. "I wanted to congratulate their goalie because she played a great game."</p>
<p>Monika Leck, who scored two goals in John McCrae's 4-1 win over Merivale in the tier 1 final, agreed with Van Gulik.</p>
<p>"It's a little awkward, but anything to prevent it," Leck said.</p>
<p>The Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations, which governs high school sport in the province, is expected to issue a similar ruling either today or Monday.</p>
<p>"We may prohibit sportsmanship gestures (handshakes) and something else may replace it," OFSAA executive director Doug Gellatly said in a telephone interview from Toronto. "Maybe they can just congratulate each other with, 'Good game.' Everything but contact."</p>
<p>On its website, the association is recommending the student/athletes use their own water bottles and towels, avoid attending provincial championships if they're ill, report all illnesses to parents and coaches, wash hands frequently and properly, sanitize hands well, and protect their immune system by getting sufficient sleep, avoiding overtraining and proper nutrition.</p>
<p>The Louis Riel Rebelles couldn't travel to St. Peter for a senior girls' AAA/AAAA regular season basketball game Thursday against the Knights because they only had four healthy players. Seven girls were suspected of having the flu, but not H1N1, according to coach André Desjardins.</p>
<p>The players developed the flu after travelling to the southern Ontario shootout invitational tournament last weekend in Hamilton. On Tuesday, Riel lost its first game 37-29 to Hillcrest. Riel only had six players because the others were at home with the flu.</p>
<p>The NCSSAA cross-country running championships also were affected on Wednesday, as almost one-third of the qualified runners didn't attend or finish their races mainly because of the flu.</p>
<p>"Early flu season decimated some team's chances and wiped out almost half of one team's entire roster," convenor Kirk Dillabaugh wrote on his high school cross-country running blog. "Of the 922 athletes entered in the meet, only 647 managed to make it to the finish line."</p>
<p>Sir Robert Borden's midget girls' team missed an opportunity to advance to the OFSAA championship when its fourth athlete couldn't run because of the flu. Almost half of the Ashbury team was missing, and most coaches were down one or two runners because of the sickness.</p>
<p>The John McCrae Bulldogs won their fourth NCSSAA tier 1 field hockey title in five years by defeating defending champion Merivale. The Bulldogs will attend the OFSAA championship Nov. 5-7 in Kitchener.</p>
<p>Shannon McGregor and Kadri Lawrence scored the other two goals for McCrae, who led 3-0 at halftime. Jesse Levy replied for Merivale early in the second half.</p>
<p>Van Gulik scored off a half-field breakaway for the Gators, who almost didn't have a team because the former coaches moved to another schools. But ice hockey coach Doug Lowe and rugby coach Leslie Rafferty stepped forward to fill the void.</p>

</p>
<p>It's hard to know what is making Canadians angrier this week: the jarring changes to CBC television news or the colossal lack of foresight and confusion surrounding the H1N1 vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>Both, perhaps, but the organizational train wreck surrounding the pandemic is of far greater concern. First came confusion, then panic, now chaos -- accompanied, inevitably, by the fevered search for culprits.</p>
<p>In the blamefest that passes for debate on Parliament Hill, the Liberals are accusing Conservatives of delivering vaccine too late, of spending more to sell their stimulus package than to promote public health, of failing to show leadership. The Conservatives say Liberals are fear-mongering, undermining their sincere efforts and trying to score cheap points amid a worrying health crisis.</p>
<p>Both are right. In fact, there is plenty of blame to go around -- not excluding the screaming media headlines that accompany each rare death.</p>
<p>This week, Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett, a medical doctor, was howled down by the hyenas on the Tory backbench when she demanded clarity for a pregnant constituent who received six conflicting opinions about which type of flu vaccine to take -- the adjuvanted version, which contains an immune booster and hasn't been sufficiently tested on pregnant women, or the unadjuvanted version which won't be available until later.</p>
<p>"This isn't funny," she shouted. "We need clarity and unambiguous messages. Why has the government only delivered confusion?"</p>
<p>In fact, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq was pretty clear in reply to Bennett: "The chief public health officer and the chief medical officer of this country have stated both adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines are safe for pregnant women. Second, Canada's obstetricians and gynecologists also say they are safe and available to Canadian pregnant women. We take that advice very seriously." (Whether it turns out to be reliable is another question.)</p>
<p>As so often happens in question period, the real issue -- the pandemic -- soon became secondary to accusations of sexism in the attacks on Bennett, who has a pretty sharp tongue herself. The next day, in fact, she was forced to apologize for a flyer accusing Conservatives of sending body bags rather than vaccine to First Nations communities.</p>
<p>(An investigation has concluded the controversial September delivery was the result of a mistake, not malice -- and certainly no reflection on Aglukkaq, an Inuk, who was visibly upset by the incident. But Bennett didn't apologize for dishonest advertising; she was responding to complaints from native leaders of insensitivity.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for all of Aglukkaq's daily reassurances -- and she has sounded increasingly confident and partisan -- many Canadians still fear they won't be vaccinated until after the disease has peaked.</p>
<p>David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer confirmed this week we are already into a second wave of the outbreak. Not to worry, though, "it's a matter of weeks before we have enough vaccine for everyone who wants it ... everyone should be done by Christmas." For many, the pace sounds a bit leisurely, given fall is the traditional flu season. It also raises the question: Why didn't they start inoculations in early September, in schools and workplaces?</p>
<p>Because of Canada's fragmented health-care system, response has been haphazard; delivery methods and time-lines differ in every province, even every city. While about 42,000 people were vaccinated in Winnipeg by Thursday, Gatineau managed only 700 on its opening day -- and turned away hundreds more. Full-scale clinics won't be opening there until Nov. 9, and there is no point crossing the river since you need an Ontario health card to be vaccinated in Ottawa.</p>
<p>It, of course, was among the first major cities to vaccinate, but thousands more turned up than could be accommodated -- a pattern being repeated in Toronto and elsewhere. At a Barrhaven clinic, someone hit on the idea of handing out numbers so people didn't have to wait in line all day. Why isn't that the practice everywhere?</p>
<p>"I would be more worried if there were no line-ups," said Aglukkaq -- small comfort to the most vulnerable, including worried parents and those with underlying medical problems, who were supposed to be first in line. As Jacqui Schofield wrote in a letter to the Citizen: "How smart is it to ask people with compromised immune systems, seniors, young children and pregnant women to stand in line for hours?"</p>
<p>The chaos will not persuade those already uneasy about the vaccine, unconcerned by the flu or undecided. Nor has the prime minister shown personal leadership; he has remained mute, in fact, since commenting weeks ago that he would get a shot "if it is generally recommended." That said, this mess isn't entirely Harper's fault -- or Dalton McGuinty's. But it doesn't inspire confidence in a rejuvenated public health system that was supposed to have learned from SARS. What if, the next time, the threat is not just a mild case of flu?</p>

</p>
<p>Ontarians who say they will not get the H1N1 vaccination are very selfish. There are two purposes to being vaccinated: first to protect yourself, and second to protect those around you. By not getting vaccinated not only are you putting yourself at risk, but also others.</p>
<p>Think of the diseases we have conquered because everyone gets vaccinated: polio, scarlet fever, small pox, measles, and so on. To conquer H1N1, the same philosophy must be adopted.</p>
<p>Those who do not protect themselves but contract the virus will be those who rail the loudest against our health system. They will clog up emergency rooms and demand instant treatment.</p>
<p>There should be a corollary: those who don't avail themselves of the vaccine without good medical reasons should also be denied treatment for the virus.</p>

<p>The City of Ottawa should be ashamed for not handling the clinics in a more efficient manner.</p>
<p>After all my failed attempts to get the vaccine at a clinic, my frustration level has forced me to reconsider even trying to attend a clinic until they become more organized with shorter wait times.</p>
<p>After having visited my obstetrician on Monday for my 39th week routine visit, with my due date being next week, he informed me to get the H1N1 vaccine soon, as it is the only chance for me to pass on the antibodies to my unborn child. Once she is born, she can't get a vaccine for the virus until she is six months old.</p>
<p>So I headed Monday afternoon to the Orléans Centrum clinic where I found the line more than a block long outside the facility. I decided to come back the next day.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the Fred G. Barrett arena in south Gloucester at 1:45 pm Tuesday, I was turned away like many others as the clinic was only seeing those who had been given numbers from the previous day or were in one of two groups being "health care workers" and the "chronically ill."</p>
<p>I then proceeded out to the Orléans clinic once again only to be informed that the wait time was already four hours.</p>
<p>How can a person, who is 39 weeks pregnant, be expected to wait in a line for four hours? I'm likely to go into labour any day and yet I can't believe the city expects those of us who are in the so called "priority group" to wait in such lengthy lines, or worse yet, turn us away before the clinics even open.</p>
<p>It is unfair that the public health officials are telling people in the five priority groups that no one will be turned away, but they are unable to manage the large volume of people who are coming to the seven clinics in the first few days. Why bother with a priority group at all if "nobody will be turned away"?</p>
<p>Well, at 39 weeks pregnant I was turned away and I cannot stand in long lines for hours and hours.</p>
<p>I feel badly for parents who have a newborn up to six months of age as they are ineligible for the vaccine, but to deny a mother who still has the chance to protect her unborn child is a disgrace.</p>

<p>By not allowing family physicians to vaccinate for H1N1, people are gathering in clinics for up to six hours, exchanging germs and getting sick, as well as being more frustrated. My family doctor can vaccinate about 40 patients an hour, if properly backed up by a good staff. Who better to administer a vaccine than the person who treats these patients throughout the year?</p>
<p>At the rate vaccinations are being reported, it will take more than 100 days to administer this vaccine to those who want it. Can we afford to wait that long?</p>
<p>I know I can't. My daughter has just been diagnosed as a probable case of H1N1. But because it takes 10 to 14 days for the swab to come back with a diagnosis, she'll probably be lining up with the rest of us in order to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>It's a sorry state of affairs indeed.</p>

<p>As infectious disease experts, we appreciate that there is considerable uncertainty in the minds of the public regarding influenza vaccine, particularly against the novel H1N1 pandemic strain. We want to inform the decision-making of the public who are uncertain of the risks and benefits of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of a group of 24 consultant physicians in the infectious diseases divisions at The Ottawa Hospital and Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. We are also wives and husbands, parents and children of people dear to us. Many of us are involved in setting policies at a local, provincial and national level. We derive no financial benefit from preventing infections. We are frequently consulted by other physicians to care for people with severe infections including severe influenza and its complications.</p>
<p>Our own personal risks of getting sick from influenza varies according to our medical conditions and our ages. At a national level, influenza infection is so common that the modest chance of developing a severe illness results in a large number of cases of severe disease and death, all largely preventable by vaccine. This happens more commonly in the debilitated, but can happen even in individuals who are otherwise healthy.</p>
<p>The vaccine has met the strict regulatory requirements for use in Canada. There has been an H1N1 component to our seasonal vaccine for years and it has been well tolerated. It is not anticipated that this vaccine will be any less tolerated than the seasonal vaccine. There is no known added risk to the new vaccine and there is increasing experience with it demonstrating its safety. Thousands of Canadians may be expected to die of influenza in the absence of mass vaccination. As such, the risk-benefit ratio is favourable for all of us.</p>
<p>All of the 24 members of our group shall undergo vaccination against H1N1 influenza. We shall all receive seasonal influenza vaccine. We shall encourage our family members to be immunized as well as our friends and patients.</p>
<p>Vaccination has been a breakthrough in the control of infectious diseases worldwide. Influenza vaccination in Ontario has reduced death and disease due to influenza as well as reducing antibiotic usage. Canadians are fortunate that there is adequate vaccine supply and that vaccination is free.</p>
<p>We strongly advocate influenza vaccines in this pandemic year and every year.</p>

<p>Ottawa's flu clinics have become a two-tier health system, with one system for the west end and a different one for the east.</p>
<p>West is better.</p>
<p>Kanata and Barrhaven clinics are handing out numbers to people who arrive in the morning. Take a number, leave right away, come back in the afternoon, when the clinic opens.</p>
<p>Orléans and Gloucester clinics are handing out numbered tickets too. But people have to wait in line for hours to get them -- outdoors if they're in Orléans -- because the clinics won't issue tickets until the early afternoon.</p>
<p>All are still well supplied with vaccine, at least, though Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's medical officer of health, warned Thursday afternoon that Ottawa could temporarily run out of vaccine by Sunday or Monday. But later in the day, Ontario Health Ministry officials announced they're sending Ottawa 49,500 doses on Saturday -- about enough for another week.</p>
<p>Ottawa has received 83,500 doses of the vaccine from the province since the inoculation program began this week: one initial shipment of 37,500 doses on Monday, and a second shipment of 46,000 doses Wednesday night.</p>
<p>So far, supplies of vaccine haven't been a problem for people who want a shot. Waiting has.</p>
<p>In Orléans, lining up outdoors makes people cold, even with camp chairs and blankets. The Kanata clinic, by contrast, has indoor seating for all, and a snack bar selling Pogo sticks and french fries.</p>
<p>And the Gloucester clinic only takes 350 people a day, less than half the number at other clinics. It runs out of spots early every day.</p>
<p>At Gloucester's Fred Barrett Arena, Heather Smith waited four hours to get a ticket for the afternoon session. We asked what she thought of the system.</p>
<p>"Ppthththth!" she said. "My joke is that a bunch of pranksters sat around and said, 'What is the worst possible approach we can take? Let's do that!'</p>
<p>"Imagine a world, pre-technology, where you have to sit around and take a number. There's no computerized system. It's ridiculous.</p>
<p>"There are people there with little babies. And they don't tell you that you don't need to bring your kids" to get the ticket.</p>
<p>Getting that ticket, she said, "is like winning the lottery."</p>
<p>Shauna Graham, the nursing manager of vaccination clinics, acknowledged that the process of getting a shot has been fraught with confusion for residents.</p>
<p>Even when residents are given a number and told to come back, it's unclear whether numbers given out one day will be honoured the next day, or whether people who line up early one day can be bumped back by people with numbers from the previous day.</p>
<p>Nor do the rules appear to be consistent from one clinic to the next.</p>
<p>Graham said there will be a clarified and streamlined process by Saturday morning, at the latest.</p>
<p>"We're figuring out how to make it better," she said.</p>
<p>Levy said there is also a longer than usual wait for people calling the city's public health information line at 613-580-6744. He said while the line normally gets about 80 calls per day, they are now up to about 700 calls, and have increased their tele-nursing staff from six to 20.</p>
<p>One further change today: A clinic at the Osgoode Community Centre will be open for the first time, from 2:30 to 8:30 p.m.</p>
<p>In Orléans, they were lining up on the sidewalk around breakfast time Thursday. The clinic opened at 2:30 p.m.</p>
<p>A flashing sign overhead promised "Tickets," but that's advertising for the theatre box office.</p>
<p>"My toes are frozen," said Nathalie Earl, who had arrived in mid-morning and got her ticket about 1:30. "I have to come back (for the actual shot), and I found out that some waited as long as five hours to be vaccinated" the previous day.</p>
<p>Tanya Finlay and daughter Monica looked ready to camp out for rock concert tickets on the Orléans sidewalk, with a folding camp chair, a blanket and warm clothes.</p>
<p>They arrived about 10:15 in the morning.</p>
<p>"She (Monica) is really warm. She's been snuggled under a blanket and playing with toys," Tanya said. Mother and daughter both had gloves, and shared the blanket.</p>
<p>They got tickets, but missed out on the first batch of 100 who were to be in the first wave at opening time.</p>
<p>"We're starting to get cold," said Chantal Desjardins, who waited for an hour and a half with Emma, eight months old, to get a ticket well back in the reservation system.</p>
<p>It was their second trip to the clinic. They drove in from her home in Hammond, near Rockland, on Wednesday, but were turned away because all the spots were full.</p>

</p>
<p>Montreal's hospitals for children are under siege, officials say, from parents concerned that any sniffle or cough could be swine flu. Many other Montrealers tell pollsters they're not worried, or else they distrust the virus more than they fear the flu.</p>
<p>That's human nature for you.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, injections across Montreal started a few days late, for poorly-explained reasons, while elsewhere in Quebec, and all across Canada, thousands of people were getting the shots. That's Quebec bureaucracy for you.</p>
<p>Panic and nonchalance are the extremes of behaviour, symptoms generated by this virus in people it has not yet infected. Neither makes any sense, and either can make the situation worse. This is no time to be careless, but it's no time to overreact, either.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that both Ste. Justine's Hospital and the Montreal Children's Hospital report waiting rooms packed with parents holding children with symptoms ranging from runny noses right up to dangerous fevers. Nobody can blame a parent for being concerned about a sick child. A Toronto teen's flu death Monday, just 48 hours after he came down with cold symptoms, has made parents across Canada hyper-alert.</p>
<p>And the swine flu does seem to be coming closer to each of us, to judge by reports of growing school absenteeism. Still, parents - and all of us - need to summon the discipline to avoid rushing to a hospital too soon. Over-reaction threatens to swamp the health system, and anyway few places are as dangerous, when it comes to a whole range of infections, as hospital waiting rooms.</p>
<p>Long lineups for immunization shots across Canada will, we hope, help convince the doubters. But the testimonials and solemn advice of health ministers, senior health bureaucrats, and almost all medical professionals should have convinced everyone, too, but did not. Consider: By refusing the shot, you endanger not only yourself but also everyone you might infect.</p>
<p>Of course, a resolve to get vaccinated will by itself kill no virus. The Montreal Health and Social Services Agency - a provincial government unit, not a municipal one - seems to have had a nice snooze last weekend, while such agencies elsewhere across Canada were deploying their first shipments of vaccine. The finger-pointing and excuse-making have now begun.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the shots are finally being administered, according to a reasoned priority list. When your turn comes, get the shot. The life you save might be your own. Or someone else's.</p>

<p>Why is it that the general populace here in Montreal has to wait until Dec. 7 to become eligible for the H1N1 vaccination when other provinces are already underway with mass inoculation programs for their citizens?</p>
<p>Not only is this an absurdly long time to wait, but it gives the impression that Quebec's health-care system is indeed two-tiered (or more), with nurses and health professionals, bus drivers, police, and firemen being given priority while the average joe has to wait over a month as the flu is given time to swing into high gear.</p>
<p>It's time the Quebec government stopped holding press conferences and patting itself on the back and actually sees that something gets done for everybody, and quickly.</p>

<p>Halloween is my favourite time of year. For a few short weeks, my little idiosyncrasies become expressions of festive cheer rather than psychological warning signs, and my tattoos seem like a seasonal joke instead of a subconscious plea for help and an exorcism. But I always have trouble picking a costume that isn't either overdone or in such poor taste somebody calls the human rights commission. So, this year, I've decided to base some costumes on some recent home video releases.</p>
<p>Nothing</p>
<p>The simplest idea is to wear nearly nothing. Watch all 51 episodes of the 1980 Astro Boy series (www.manga.com[http://www.manga.com]), about the adventures of a robot child, and then show up to parties in nothing but rocket boots, swim trunks, and hair gel. Even easier, try dressing like anyone in Shameless, Tasteless (www.</p>
<p>troma.com), a collection of the sleazy, subversive and graphic short films of Yakov Levi. You'll need even fewer clothes, though judging from some of the performers' hollow eyes, a few years of hard living might help sell the look.</p>
<p>Rock Star</p>
<p>Pick up a few unicorn shirts or merch from Cinderella's 1986 Long Cold Winter tour at a thrift shop and call yourself anyone from your local indie rock scene. Alternately, borrow some German army medals, biker hair, and a swollen liver from a metal bar and dress as Motörhead's Lemmy. Make sure you've got it right by watching director Richard Stanley's amazing Hardware (1990, www.severin-films.com[http://www.severin-films.com]), a surreal science fiction film about a killer robot in a post-apocalyptic world, which features a cameo by Lemmy.</p>
<p>Superhero</p>
<p>Superheroes are all the rage nowadays, but unless you pick one that's obscure, you'll look like a man-child overcompensating for outgrown Hulk Underoos. Be original and dress like Apama, the superhero from Hero Tomorrow (2007, www.swingingcane.com[http://www.swingingcane.com]), in which a possibly delusional comic-book artist dresses in punk-rock burlap, like a Sex Pistol in a bag. Or, if villainy is more your style, check out some of the masks in West 32nd (2007, www.pathfinderpictures.com[http://www.pathfinderpictures.com]), a film about Korean organized crime in New York. The film is gritty drama, not action, but the masks would look great when battling Daredevil.</p>
<p>Illness</p>
<p>Disease - like the Alzheimer's featured in the compelling Schism (2008 - www.schismmovie.com[http://www.schismmovie.com]), the story of a man suffering from dementia in a nursing home - is one of my greatest fears. But dressing up as something like the swine flu involves either twisting your body into RNA strands or carrying around Piglet wrapped in a burial shroud. For something a little simpler, try whatever hallucinations inspired The Saragossa Manuscript (1965, www.facets.org[http://www.facets.org]), in which a soldier journeys through a haunted Spain in the 18th century. Your best bet is to dress as a ghost, but soak the white sheet in ether first (please don't actually do this.)</p>
<p>Dinner</p>
<p>Visit your local butcher and dress as the victim of a cannibal. If you're trick-or-treating with a child, drape yourself in beef ribs and offal while covering the kid in animal skins to re-enact Offspring (2009 - www.anchorbayentertainment.com[http://www.anchorbayentertainment.com]), based on the intense Jack Ketchum novel about a feral cannibalistic clan. If you're going solo, cover yourself in chocolate syrup and flour to imitate one of the victims in black and white classic Night of the Living Dead (1968). Make a continuous stream of quips relating to geek culture to simulate watching the film with commentary by Mystery Science Theatre 3000 alumni, like on the Rifftrax Night of the Living Dead DVD (2009, www.legendfilms.com[http://www.legendfilms.com]).</p>

<p>Toronto --</p>
<p>Ontario is suspending the rollout of its H1N1 flu shots to the general public next week, amid a shortage of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said the province will receive only 170,000 doses of the vaccine next week, much less than previously expected.</p>
<p>For this reason, she said only those at higher risk of developing complications from the virus will be vaccinated next week.</p>
<p>"We will not be immunizing people who do not fall under the priority groups," Dr. King said at a news conference on Friday.</p>

<p>"If there is difficulty with breathing or a fever over 38.5 (C)," says Dr. Anne Matlow, "get medical help."</p>
<p>Matlow, director of infection and disease at Sick Kids, says the hospital was prepared for the numbers to go up in emergency with the H1N1 pandemic, as they have this week.</p>
<p>The situation is being monitored to determine whether a separate assessment area is required for respiratory infections, she said.</p>
<p>"The numbers at pediatric centres are going to be high." she acknowledges.</p>
<p>That's because children's and young people's immune systems haven't had as much experience with various flu strains and may be more vulnerable and because "the inflammatory reaction in children or younger people can be stronger."</p>
<p>There's also evidence, says Matlow, "that this virus may attack lungs in a stronger way than normal flu streams."</p>
<p>Matlow says there are two phases of the illness to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>"In the primary illness, during the first couple of days, if breathing seems particularly laboured, seek help," she advises. It could be a case of viral pneumonia which may be accompanied by "a dry, unproductive cough."</p>
<p>The other situation to be alert to, she says, is when there's mild illness that seems to be getting better "and then takes a turn for the worse: bacterial pneumonia might be happening."</p>
<p>A typical symptom of this is coughing up "green yucky sputum," says Matlow.</p>
<p>Anyone with the flu should start feeling significantly better in about three days, she says. Any relapse after that is a strong indication of complications."</p>
<p>Matlow encourages people with questions or concerns about flu-like symptoms to contact Telehealth (1-866-797-0000).</p>
<p>According to David Jensen, a spokesman for the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Telehealth Ontario has experienced a significant increase in call volumes since the second week of October.</p>
<p>Daily incoming call volumes to the service have quadrupled, going from about 3,000 calls to up to 13,000 calls. As a result, callers may be experiencing longer than normal wait times. The most significant increase occurred after Oct. 23, and these are the average wait times since that date, according to the ministry:</p>
<p>To speak to an individual (nurse or receptionist): 18 minutes</p>
<p>To queue to speak to a nurse: 9 minutes</p>
<p>To receive a callback from a nurse if the caller opts not to wait in queue: 70 minutes</p>
<p>Jensen says that Telehealth is undertaking a number of strategies to deal with this surge.</p>
<p>He advises, "It's important for people to know that they should only phone Telehealth when they have questions about symptoms. If they want information about flu shot clinics, they should contact Service Ontario at 1-800-476-9708 or their local public health unit.</p>
<p>Also, he reminds people about the self-assessment tool for symptoms, available at www.ontario.ca/flu[http://www.ontario.ca/flu].</p>

<p>When transit systems and amusement parks are overloaded, they turn to a "pass system" to control crowds.</p>
<p>When the public health system around Sault Ste. Marie was preparing for its H1N1 vaccination clinics a week ago, it set up a call centre that booked more than 3,000 appointments a day.</p>
<p>The result? No long lineups at clinics in the area.</p>
<p>So, how can H1N1 vaccination clinics in the GTA be better run to avoid several-hour lines outside?</p>
<p>Here are a few ideas to make the whole experience less stressful:</p>
<p>Create a fast-pass system, similar to the one used at <span class="companylink">Disney</span> World, where people would be given an approximate time to return to the clinic. Or a simple appointment system would work.</p>
<p>Give out numbers to people in the line so they can leave and return later for their shots.</p>
<p>Plant signs along the lineup that tell people how long the wait will be. For example: "One hour from here."</p>
<p>Make flu shots more accessible at community hubs - schools, recreational centres and even workplaces - to spread out the demand for shots.</p>
<p>Extend clinic hours so people wouldn't have to scramble to get in line within a short time frame.</p>

<p>Buffalo -- Like every other resident of Erie County, New York, Anthony Billittier does not know when the people of his community will be able to get their H1N1 vaccinations.</p>
<p>This frustrates him. Especially because he is Erie County's health commissioner.</p>
<p>His staff, based in the county seat of Buffalo, now spends much of the workday fielding H1N1-related questions they cannot answer.</p>
<p>No, they do not know how much of the vaccine the county's government will receive, nor when. No, they do not know how much the county's doctors will receive, nor when.</p>
<p>"We don't have data on who's got what, or, even worse, who's going to get what," Billittier, a doctor, said Thursday. "All we can tell people is that we're as frustrated as they are. We ask them to be patient. And we tell them that we will do everything we can to get vaccine into the hands of their doctors as soon as we can get it. It's not a great answer, but it's the truth."</p>
<p>Torontonians dismayed by the lines at vaccination clinics, and at Thursday's early clinic closures, might feel like lottery winners if they took a drive over the Peace Bridge to talk to Buffalonians.</p>
<p>Precious few have been offered the chance to be vaccinated. About half of Erie County's population of nearly 1 million people, Billittier said, belongs to one of the five categories designated as high risk by the Centers for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Erie doctors and health officials have received fewer than 20,000 doses of the vaccine; to date, he believes, they have vaccinated fewer than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>The CDC and the administration of President Barack Obama face increasing criticism for vaccine shortages across the U.S. The shortages were caused in large part by manufacturing delays that reduced the available supply to fewer than 25 million doses from the 160 million the government expected to be ready by this time.</p>
<p>Unlike Canadian provinces, in which vaccination has been first offered through a number of government clinics, Erie and many other American counties have asked their state governments to send vaccine directly to family doctors.</p>
<p>Confusion sometimes prevails.</p>
<p>"My first shipment just came in today, and I have to send it back," said Buffalo family doctor Raul Vazquez. "I asked for 400 shots, and they gave me 100 of the nasal."</p>
<p>Some Buffalo residents are unconcerned about the shortage. Others express anxiety, fear or anger.</p>
<p>"I think it's pretty ridiculous that we live in a country that's considered a superpower, but it can't even take care of the people who live here," said Ryan Nasca, 24.</p>
<p>Angela Vega, grocery shopping with a teenage daughter, said she has repeatedly asked doctors when the vaccine will be made available. Her 7-year-old daughter, who has asthma, recently fell ill; Vega, 40, worried she had contracted H1N1.</p>
<p>"Obama is taking too long," she said. "They need to work really fast to give the vaccine to the children who are in school. ... I don't care about me, just the children."</p>
<p>New York Governor David Paterson declared a state of emergency over H1N1 on Thursday. Last week, a small New York school district in which many students had flu-like symptoms temporarily closed.</p>
<p>In Erie County, some schools are reporting absenteeism rates as high as 30 per cent. Most cases, however, have been mild; Buffalo has not yet experienced a tragedy like the death of Toronto's 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio.</p>
<p>Billittier believes he has personal experience with H1N1: he thinks one or two of his daughters may have contracted it earlier this month. Both recovered - leaving him free to worry about the flu as merely a beleaguered public official and not also a beleaguered parent.</p>
<p>"This is just a constantly evolving issue. There are too many variables. And trying to put your finger on it is becoming nearly impossible."</p>

</p>
<p>Get the shot.</p>
<p>That's the now familiar refrain of health officials who have repeatedly urged Canadians to get vaccinated to shield themselves against the potentially deadly H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>That message gained sad urgency in Toronto earlier this week after the sudden death of an apparently healthy and active 13-year-old boy that was linked to the H1NI flu. The teenager's death and the recent "wave" of H1N1 infections in Ontario prompted Toronto public health officials to announce on Tuesday afternoon the opening of vaccination clinics for "high priority" groups on Thursday, several days earlier than previously scheduled.</p>
<p>A wise step, I thought, but more than a little tardy too. I wondered why the largest city in the country had failed to open vaccination clinics when smaller municipalities neighbouring Toronto had clinics already up and running.</p>
<p>In any event, thinking myself a prudent and responsible parent, I set out late on Tuesday to find out where and when the clinics would be open, particularly since several members of my family fall under the so-called priority group.</p>
<p>That's when I embarked upon a long and frustrating bureaucratic merry-go-round. The involuntary journey confirmed my suspicions that the sober-sounding and, no doubt, hard-working local health officials have been doing too much talking and not enough planning.</p>
<p>My first stop late Tuesday was the Toronto Public Health (TPH) website. I checked it several times looking for any new information about clinic locations and operating times. No luck. I checked back Wednesday morning to find the following message pasted in bold type on the site: "Please note: Toronto Public Health will be announcing additional clinic hours. Check back for an updated schedule."</p>
<p>As instructed, I repeatedly checked back in vain to find the "updated schedule." Abandoning the website, I called Toronto Public Health's main number instead, hoping to get some simple, clear information about the clinics that were now slated to open on Thursday.</p>
<p>A message directed me to press 1 if my call concerned the "H1N1 flu." I did. "Listen carefully," the voice said. "If you have a question about H1N1 or our clinics, press 4." Not surprisingly, I didn't get any answers, just a busy signal. Lots of people pressing 4, I reasoned. I decided to try again later. Again, a busy signal. I kept dialling and pressing 1 and 4 like a robot most of Wednesday and, time and again, all I encountered was a busy signal.</p>
<p>I needed someone to help me break the information log jam. So, I called my city councillor's city hall office. Sadly, no luck there either. I was greeted by another voice-mail message. My councillor's recording asked that I leave a message and promised to call back. He didn't.</p>
<p>My next stop was the city's all purpose 311 information line. On my first try, I listened for what seemed like an eternity to a recorded message assuring me that my call was "important." By this point, I didn't feel important, only annoyed. I got through on my second try, to be told that only two clinics would be open on Thursday from 12 to 7 p.m.</p>
<p>To my way of thinking, two clinics to serve potentially hundreds of thousands of concerned Torontonians was a shockingly inadequate response in light of the ominous warnings by local and national health officials who have, as I said, repeatedly urged us to get the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>To be sure of the information, I drove with my daughter to the East York Civic Centre, the site of one the two clinics, where I found a gaggle of parents and seniors asking a solicitous security guard manning the information desk to confirm when precisely the clinic would be open on Thursday. He told us the clinic would open for business at 9 a.m. When I told him the city said the clinic would open at 12, he shrugged his shoulders and said: "That's what I know, sir."</p>
<p>One of the mothers sighed as she pushed a stroller towards the exit. "This is all so ridiculous," she said.</p>
<p>She's right.</p>

<p>Tory heckles drown out Liberal MP's flu</p>
<p>questions, Oct. 28</p>
<p>I was shocked and furious when I came across this report in the Star. As a father of two I am concerned that H1N1 can affect my family because my oldest daughter was showing flu-like symptoms this week. How is it that our politicians are laughing and heckling a concerned MP raising an important point about the H1N1 vaccination? Pregnant women across the country are concerned for the well-being of their unborn due to this flu and the heckling was way out of line. It shows the Conservative party's lack of integrity and I am seriously considering changing my support come next election.</p>

<p>Hundreds queue for shots,</p>
<p>Oct. 29</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccination rollout in Ontario is a disgrace. The few clinics that have been opened are ill-prepared to handle the population volume from within their massive catchment areas.</p>
<p>At the same time, many doctors' offices have been precluded from providing the vaccine for their patients (contrary to the standard practice with seasonal flu vaccinations), adding to overcrowding at already overwhelmed clinics. Health-care professionals, people at risk, and the elderly have been forced to stand for hours in the cold and rain only to be told to come back the next day - outrageous. I don't doubt some may very well get sick from standing in crowded lines in miserable weather for the better part of a day.</p>
<p>Why has the combination of doctors' offices, schools and clinics at places of employment, seniors' centres and community facilities been abandoned - a system that for years has been effective, efficient and convenient - in favour of one that can't properly deliver? With all those high salaries and consulting contracts in both provincial and federal agencies, I don't suppose this could be the way they've brilliantly decided to save money?</p>

<p>What a travesty this is. We have the province urging everyone to get an H1N1 flu shot, but you have to line up for hours to get one. Even worse, the hours are ridiculous. Many people, including myself, can't realistically be innoculated during those hours because of work commitments. And do front-line workers have to line up to get their shots? They could surely receive their vaccines at their places of work, whether it's a hospital or nursing home. It is obvious the province did not properly prepare for this crisis. The clinics should be open 24 hours a day until everyone who wants a shot gets one. Let's get this done right.</p>

</div><div>396 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by crowds in excess of 1,000 people, Toronto closed its two H1N1 vaccine clinics just hours after opening them Thursday. Meanwhile, Sault Ste. Marie made headlines by immunizing residents with almost mechanical precision, sparing them undue delay or lineups. That tale of two cities underlines a fundamental flaw with our public health system: it's fragmented and disorganized.</p>
<p>Troubling divergence is evident coast to coast, with public health responsibilities split between federal officials and 13 provincial and territorial health ministries. For example, British Columbia's health authorities have been breaking big, 500-dose batches of vaccine into smaller, more manageable lots so that doctors can more easily order what they need. Ontario, at first, didn't do that.</p>
<p>Even within this province, public health is delivered in a disjointed, inefficient manner. Ontario has 36 public health units. Many are quite small, while some straddle various political boundaries. Jurisdictional silos get in the way of coordinated action. "In emergency response, you need command and control," Dr. Vivek Goel of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection told the Star's editorial board Thursday. "That aspect of the system still needs to be addressed."</p>
<p>Creating a centralized and efficient national public health system from a welter of federal, provincial and territorial jurisdictions is a formidable challenge. But Queen's Park has no excuse for the seeming disorganization of the H1N1 vaccination program within Ontario. In Quebec, the vaccine is being delivered through 18 health authorities, not 36. One option for Ontario to consider would be to align public health unit boundaries with those of the province's 14 Local Health Integration Networks.</p>
<p>At the very least, this province's Telehealth information line should be better integrated with the public health system. The line has been flooded by a five-fold increase in callers. Ontarians anxious about flu and reluctant to clog hospital emergency wards have done what they were supposed to do: they have called Telehealth about their concerns. Many did not get through to anyone. Additional nurses are now being trained so that Telehealth can take more calls, but why wasn't that done before H1N1's long-anticipated second wave hit?</p>
<p>The pandemic's harsh glare tells us that we need a much better co-ordinated public health system than the one we have now.</p>

<p>The wailing babies, the flame-cheeked toddlers stuffed into too-warm winter clothing, the harassed and exasperated mums, the zombie-faced seniors and the amazingly cheerful nurses: This was Toronto coping with a feared pandemic on Thursday at North York Civic Centre.</p>
<p>A meandering queue stretched from inside the building, around Mel Lastman Square and right out to Yonge St., many wisely arriving with lawn chairs for biding on and novels, crossword puzzle books, hand-held games to while away the hours.</p>
<p>The crunch of mostly patient supplicants outnumbered the sleep-over crowds this city has seen in the past for Rolling Stones concerts and the Christmas roll-out of Tickle-Me Elmo dolls, Cabbage Patch Kids, PlayStation 3. And, should that unlikely day ever come again, surely no less a mob than would converge for Stanley Cup final ducats - as if.</p>
<p>Just to be stuck in the arm with a needle.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the H1N1 virus appears a life-and-death crisis, the public understandably alarmed by shrill health warnings, contradictory public service messages and media-massaged hysteria.</p>
<p>Better to be safe than sorry. Better to be vigilant than grieving, like the shock-numbed parents of Evan Frustaglio, a hockey-playing Mississauga 13-year-old who was fine one day and dead within 48 hours - the Every Son who weighs now on every parent's conscience, their deepest fears of loss from the blue.</p>
<p>It is wrong - as some calm-down commentators have suggested - to claim that, in the absence of neurosis over a global swine flu surge, the death of an otherwise healthy teenager would have passed without comment and panic. Such a tragedy is not normal, would have been deserving of public notice on its own merits, and can only now be shrugged off by those who don't have kids of their own to fret over.</p>
<p>So they came Thursday, swamping the two high-risk Toronto Public Health clinics set up with advance shipments of the H1N1 vaccine, ahead of the six-week inoculation campaign that has already been pushed up - if still too late, perhaps, to do much prophylactic good, given the apparent seven-day lag before the serum takes immune effect, by which time the flu spike might have peaked.</p>
<p>By 1 p.m., security officers and bicycle cops had lopped off the North York queue, drawing a line in the berm, claiming there wasn't enough vaccine to innoculate the hundreds upon hundreds who had descended on what was advertised as priority-only-please. This, as one run-off-her-feet nurse later stated, was incorrect. There was no serum shortage, simply too high a demand to cope with. Those at the end of the line were warned they were in for a seven-hour wait and the clinic was scheduled to close at 7 p.m. after opening at noon - not 9 a.m. as many had been told.</p>
<p>"I'm pregnant," said Grace Park, 35, who just made the queue-cut, end of the line with her dad. "I never expected there would be this many people and I don't know if I can handle it, standing for seven hours. I'm not even sure getting a shot is good for the baby. It's all very confusing."</p>
<p>Elizabeth Monier-Williams pushed along two strollers, 10-month-old son Alexander in one pram and a friend's baby in the other. Evan Frustaglio's death, she said, was a "game breaker," the impetus that jolted her into action rather than wait for wider distribution through walk-in clinics and doctors' offices. "I'd never forgive myself if something were to happen to my son. Even if this one isn't that one, the big pandemic we're all worried about, it's bad enough. It's best that we protect our kids and not take chances."</p>
<p>Dave Cohen, 37, is a diabetic and father to three youngsters. Seated on a camp chair, he was re-reading The Lord of the Rings while waiting for the queue to nudge ahead. As a web designer for "crowd sourcing logistics," he took a dim professional view of how this demand-crush has been handled.</p>
<p>"They should have announced precisely the requirements for people to get their shots today. We could have filled out forms in advance, or maybe have somebody going through the line, taking down criteria details. But nobody seemed prepared to make those hard decisions. It seems more a problem of personnel distribution than vaccine availability. This process is doomed to failure."</p>
<p>Only a few threw up their hands and stomped off.</p>
<p>"I'm giving up," announced Lori Germain, grabbing hold of 4-year-old Gracie and 8-year-old Matthew, the latter, asthmatic, kept out of school Thursday for the purpose of getting an injection.</p>
<p>"The organization is appalling. First, they scare the hell out of you; then, they say, 'Sorry, can't do it, too many people.' If a private company was acting like this, they'd go bankrupt.</p>
<p>"If children are a priority, then why aren't they doing the inoculating in schools? That's what I find amazing."</p>
<p>Stefanie Schaefler arrived shortly after 9 a.m., two kids and 78-year-old diabetic mother in tow. It was nearly 2 p.m. as they neared the clinic entrance. "We know the boy who died so this feels very personal to us."</p>
<p>But queue gossip had it that employees at the civic centre had actually been allowed inoculation access on Wednesday, with the overflow given numbers to obtain needles off the mark Thursday morning. That caused much grumping.</p>
<p>Inside the clinic proper, 20 injection stations dealt adeptly with the constant flow, nurses at the back pre-filling the syringes and passing them up to the frontline troops, lollipops for the kids to quell the tears, the inoculated resting for 15 minutes in the after-care room.</p>
<p>Jonathan Lahey was there en famille, with wife and two sons aged 4 and 13. "Dominic is in kindergarten and for the past few weeks it's been sick, not sick, sick, not sick. We figured it was better for everybody to come down and get the shot. It's taken a long time, but I feel relieved that we got it done."</p>
<p>Some - prioritized in the lineup because they'd pleaded their case - were indeed brought to the front. "My daughter asked me if I'd brought documents to prove my case," said Nathalie Liederman, 59, who suffers from chronic lung disease. "I said, if anyone wants proof, I'll show them the operation scar that runs up my back."</p>
<p>Liederman had been "rescued" from the queue after complaining that her condition would never allow her to stand for hours. "I would have passed out cold."</p>
<p>She expressed gratitude after the fact to the queue monitor who took pity on her. "His name is Martin. So I just want to say, thank you very much Martin."</p>
<p>Rosie DiManno usually appears Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.</p>

<p>FOR hours, Avan Eugene stood in a long lineup to get the H1N1 shot while his wife sat in their car in the parking lot of the Garden City Shopping Centre.</p>
<p>Holding ticket numbers 571 and 572, Eugene, and his wife Jane, had no choice, even though after a more than four-hour wait the number being called was 453.</p>
<p>Eugene said his wife is battling breast cancer and had been advised to get the vaccine because chemotherapy had knocked down her immune system.</p>
<p>"The doctor said she should not be out in a crowd," he said Thursday.</p>
<p>"She has to be very careful."</p>
<p>Wiping a tear from his eye, Eugene added, "I can't afford for her to be worse."</p>
<p>The people staffing the clinic said Eugene could run outside to get his wife when their numbers came up, but unfortunately they could not bump them forward in line.</p>
<p>Theirs is just one story out of many across the city as thousands of Winnipeggers swamped 12 immunization clinics spread across the city hoping to get the shot to protect them against H1N1.</p>
<p>By 3 p.m. on Thursday, Winnipeg Regional Health Authority officials were reporting 6,430 Winnipeggers had been vaccinated so far that day, bringing the three-day total to 47,177.</p>
<p>But health officials -- and many people in the long lineup, said the lines would be shorter if only people on the province's priority group were in them.</p>
<p>Maggie Tremblay planned ahead -- she brought lunch, toys and a chair to keep her four-year-old daughter Hannah distracted.</p>
<p>Getting in line at 10 a.m., Tremblay had logged more than two hours by 12:37 p.m., but there were still dozens of people ahead of her.</p>
<p>"They said two hours, but I've almost been here for two hours and it looks like I'll probably be another two hours," she said.</p>
<p>"And because (Hannah) is four, she has to come back in 21 days to go through the line again (to get another shot)... certain people shouldn't be here in line. They should sit at home so people in priority can get the shot. It's (H1N1) getting children -- they should let them go first."</p>
<p>Nearby, Eva Smith, who has asthma, diabetes and cardiac problems, read a book as she sat in her scooter in the line.</p>
<p>"I'll finish this book long before I get to the front, but I always come with two books... at least I can sit," she said.</p>
<p>Tanis Miller ultimately decided to wait in line with her two-year-old daughter, Brook, but she thought twice when she saw the line was more than 100 metres in length.</p>
<p>"I want her to have the shot, but a three-hour wait?" Miller said.</p>
<p>"Obviously I think children should go first. Her doctor doesn't have the vaccine yet, but I can't wait until next week."</p>

<p>Oakville, Ont. -- I really don't get it. How can Ontario's chief medical officer of health be surprised that demand is exceeding expectations (Ontario To Open More Clinics To Meet Flu Shot Demand – online, Oct. 29)? With all the media hype and hysteria, not to mention the call for everyone to get the H1N1 vaccine, how on earth can she be surprised?</p>
<p>On top of that, how do we even know who has the H1N1 flu? I am now dealing with my second child falling ill with what we suspect is H1N1. Both my kids (13 and 10) have asthma. Both have had more than 10 episodes of pneumonia in the past six years, and both should be considered high risk, especially since one of the issues around H1N1 is the fact that it seems to attack the lungs in some people in a virulent way.</p>
<p>But two doctors have refused to speculate on whether my kids have H1N1, even though the symptoms include high fever, coughing, sore throat, tightness in the chest, body aches and lethargy. I hope we don't end up in the emergency room. I just don't get it.</p>

<p>Canada's H1N1 immunization campaign has started off on a right foot, and a wrong one. Right, because Canadians, rejecting the fear-mongering of the vaccine conspiracy theorists, have turned out in droves where the vaccine has been offered to those in priority groups. Wrong, because the health authorities have unaccountably been taken by surprise by the demand.</p>
<p>Those same authorities have insisted that Canadians be vaccinated. Why then set up such limited facilities that the vaccination clinics are quickly overwhelmed? Are public health authorities surprised when people actually listen to what they say?</p>
<p>It seems a fitting sequel to the lack of urgency that at times has shown up in the federal response. Ottawa was slow to make a vaccine available; the provinces are slow to prepare the clinics that can handle the public demand. Alberta and Ontario, for instance, opened a handful of clinics (in Calgary and Edmonton on Monday, and yesterday in Toronto), which were immediately swamped. Toronto closed one of its two clinics to new arrivals just one hour after it opened. Two clinics for the first pandemic in 40 years? Meanwhile, some other provinces are sitting on their vaccine supply till next week. Government authorities have had several months to put their plans in place. It turns out they are flying by the seat of their pants.</p>
<p>The depth of public concern should be no surprise. In Alberta, some schools have reported more than 30 per cent of their students staying home, ill, on some days. In Ontario, two young people, a 13-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl, died in the past few days from swine flu. The boy was a fit, elite athlete, and died suddenly, though his outward symptoms seemed minor. While such deaths may prove to be rare, they demonstrate the catastrophic risk that people need to protect against. If the public was complacent, those deaths were enough to wake people to the urgency of being vaccinated.</p>
<p>Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., by actually booking 3,500 appointments a day using a call centre working overtime, managed to handle the vaccinations smoothly. That innovative spirit should not be beyond other local and provincial authorities.</p>
<p>The dreaded “second wave” of H1N1 has arrived in some parts of Canada. The authorities have had the time to prepare for what they like to call “the biggest vaccination campaign in history.” Canadians by and large appear ready to do the right thing and be vaccinated. The question is whether the authorities are capable of upholding their end of the bargain.</p>
