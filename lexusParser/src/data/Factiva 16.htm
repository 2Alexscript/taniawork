<p>A vicious flu, a national vaccine strategy, and children left to wait at the back of the line. It is difficult to believe, but that is where much of Canada puts its children. At the back of the H1N1 vaccination line.</p>
<p>Alberta has still not set a date by which healthy children over five are expected to be vaccinated. Neither has Nova Scotia. Ontario and British Columbia are just beginning this week, three weeks into the inoculation campaign, to reach children over five.</p>
<p>The answers from public-health officials as to why children have been left to wait have a certain cold logic to them. Children are deemed – according to the epidemiological evidence – not at high risk of severe illness or death. Others at less risk of contracting the swine flu, such as senior citizens, are at greater risk of dire complications. They have therefore been brought into the second or subsequent lists of priority groups, after pregnant women, children under five, aboriginals and health workers.</p>
<p>But the result of such cold logic is surely absurd. Canada has vaccinated more than 20 per cent of its people and not, for the most part, reached its children over five. The disease has been allowed to cut a swath through schools in much of the country. In Nova Scotia, some schools had 30 or 40 per cent of pupils off with flu-like illness. The children are “super-spreaders” who bring the disease to those at severe risk. Inoculating them protects the broader community.</p>
<p>And there is something else, beyond the realm of cold logic: that it is innate in human beings to protect the young. They are first on to the lifeboats.</p>
<p>Logic that leads to anomalous results needs revisiting.</p>
<p>New Brunswick and Saskatchewan included healthy children among their priority groups from the beginning. Why? New Brunswick's reasoning was partly logistical: It made sense to put its vaccination clinics in the schools, and it would have been strange to leave the children out. But there are several other reasons cited by Eilish Cleary, the province's chief medical officer of health. By starting with the children, the province could delay the spreading of the virus. And the disease is unpredictable. “We have to be realistic and say this is a new disease,” Dr. Cleary said. “If you look at places like the U.S., they've had a significant number of pediatric deaths.” Most hospitalizations from H1N1 in New Brunswick have involved school-age children, she said.</p>
<p>In the U.S., young people up to 24 have been treated as a priority group, based on epidemiological evidence, set out clearly on the CDC website, that shows the median age of H1N1 hospitalization up to July 31 was 20. “Senior citizens are not a high priority for vaccination unless they have other underlying health issues,” a CDC spokesman said by e-mail yesterday, “but once they exhibit symptoms, they are a priority for anti-virals such as Tamiflu.”</p>
<p>Canada has left its children with little protection for the first pandemic in 41 years. Is this what Canadians wanted from their heralded national strategy?</p>

<p>A passenger injured in Monday's Jeep rollover says she's surprised to be alive.</p>
<p>The accident was preventable, 15-year-old Jessica Smith says.</p>
<p>Smith was one of four teenagers crammed into the back of the vehicle. None of the kids in the rear was wearing a seatbelt.</p>
<p>A boy sitting in the front passenger seat was buckled in. He walked away from the crash.</p>
<p>Smith says the group was heading from Shaftesbury High School to <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> when the accident happened.</p>
<p>"He (the driver) was swerving from left to right. He was doing it on purpose. I was scared."</p>
<p>Some passengers encouraged the driver to continue his erratic driving. The Jeep was travelling at high speeds down Grant Avenue when the driver lost control and hit the curb.</p>
<p>"I had that anxious feeling like in a movie and there's a car scene and you know something bad is going to happen. A second later, what I predicted came true," Smith says.</p>
<p>The Jeep flipped, tossing the passengers out.</p>
<p>There is no evidence alcohol or intoxicants were involved in the crash, police say. They are investigating whether the crash was linked to texting or chatting on a cellphone while driving.</p>
<p>Smith couldn't see a cellphone from her vantage point in the back seat. There's much she can't remember about Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>"They told me we flipped over four times," the teen says. "I blacked out so I only remember two times."</p>
<p>Sitting straight as a pole in her family's Linden Woods home, Smith is clearly in pain. The petite girl can't turn her neck. Her spine hurts. She's got abrasions on her wrist and back. There's a black eye. She's got what feels like road burn on her scalp.</p>
<p>"I didn't feel any pain at first because I was in shock."</p>
<p>Miraculously, her cellphone was still in her pocket.</p>
<p>She called her mother, who was across the street waiting in line for an H1N1 shot. Rhessa Schacter ran through the gridlocked traffic and saw her daughter being loaded into an ambulance.</p>
<p>Smith says five people ended up outside the Jeep. Only the front passenger remained in the vehicle.</p>
<p>"I was in shock when it happened. I remember what led up to the accident. I ended up on the grass and the car was far from me," Smith says.</p>
<p>She saw her friends scattered like rag dolls on the boulevard, sidewalk and lawn. One girl was bleeding from her ears.</p>
<p>"The music was on, really loud. After it happened, the music was still playing. It didn't stop. It was like a movie."</p>
<p>The five passengers were taken to Children's Hospital. Two of them were released immediately. They're all home now.</p>
<p>The driver is 18 and was taken to a different hospital. He was alert enough to apologize to his passengers after the accident. When the vice-principal of Shaftesbury arrived at Children's to check on the students, he also brought a contrite message from the driver.</p>
<p>Immediately after the accident, Smith says, the driver was lying on the ground and cursing.</p>
<p>"He was like, 'My life is ruined. What's going to happen to me?' "</p>
<p>It is a miracle none of the students was seriously injured.</p>
<p>"No one got anything broken," Smith says. "I feel so lucky. I didn't get killed. I don't have a hundred broken bones."</p>
<p>The girl's mother said it's unbelievable no one lost their life.</p>
<p>"Someone was really looking out for these kids," she says.</p>
<p>News of the accident spread quickly. Kids texted other kids, layering misinformation on top of speculation.</p>
<p>"I was upset there was a rumour that I was dead," Smith says. She may never understand the impact that falsehood had on her close friends.</p>
<p>Smith says she's learned a number of lessons from the accident.</p>
<p>"I feel like I don't want to get in a car with a teenager," she says sombrely. "Be careful who you trust."</p>
<p>Wearing a seatbelt has become a priority, she says.</p>
<p>"I sometimes don't bother but I will now."</p>
<p>Jessica Smith was supposed to get her learner's permit on Friday. She's not sure if she'll be able to go through with it. She's not even sure she can ever be comfortable in a car again.</p>
<p>The biggest lesson those six kids should learn: They're not immortal. Bad things do happen to nice kids. Sometimes it only takes one stupid decision to change or end a life.</p>
<p>The lessons we try to teach our children are often ignored or considered alarmist.</p>
<p>For six Winnipeg families, the worst almost happened on Monday.</p>
<p>They are lucky to live to tell the tale.</p>

<p>TORONTO -- As Canadian health officials assured the public that the pandemic H1N1 vaccine is as safe as the seasonal flu shot, at least one province is reporting almost double the rate of severe allergic reactions.</p>
<p>British Columbia Centre for Disease Control said it is probing why residents suffered anaphylaxis at a higher rate compared with the previous five seasonal-flu-vaccination programs, suggesting it could be because some people received H1N1 and the seasonal flu shot simultaneously.</p>
<p>It will be several more weeks before B.C. officials can definitively attribute the spike in the rate – 2.2 per 100,000 doses distributed, compared to 1.2 per 100,000 doses. None of the 18 anaphylaxis reactions in B.C. resulted in death.</p>
<p>“It would be fair to say that as more people are vaccinated in the weeks and months ahead, and more data are collected, the rates of adverse events per 100,000 may change both in B.C. and nationally,” said Roy Wadia, spokesman for the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>So far, no other province has reported higher rates of anaphylaxis – a severe, whole-body allergic reaction that can be characterized by respiratory distress, swelling of the lips, eyelids, throat or tongue, and low blood pressure, among other symptoms.</p>
<p>New Brunswick said it had one case of anaphylaxis in the 150,000 doses administered, while Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan all reported rates of serious side effects that are comparable to previous years of providing seasonal flu shots. The Ontario health ministry said the province has had nine serious reactions but could not say how many of those were due to severe allergic reactions.</p>
<p>Canada's top public health doctor stressed yesterday that the H1N1 shot is safe – only 36 Canadians have suffered serious side effects, including one death, out of 6.6-million doses as of Nov. 7.</p>
<p>The death of an elderly person after receiving the H1N1 shot has not been conclusively linked to the vaccine and is currently being investigated, said David Butler-Jones, the country's chief public health officer. It's possible, he said, that the person had an underlying medical condition.</p>
<p>“Canadians can be assured that, to date, the frequency of serious reactions is less than 1 per 100,000 doses distributed, which is what we've seen with other vaccines,” said Dr. Butler-Jones. “The benefit of immunization, the prevention of serious illness and death far outweigh any theoretical risk associated with being immunized.”</p>
<p>Overall, the rate of serious adverse events from the H1N1 vaccine has been trivial: 0.54 per 100,000 doses. The main side effects include allergic reaction, fever and convulsions. Allergic reactions have been reported at immunization clinics, although not as serious as anaphylaxis. Other more common mild effects, such as nausea, dizziness and headaches have also been reported.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Five more die as vaccine demand falls; H1N1 shot might be available soon to anyone who wants one</b>

<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>952 words</div><div>18 November 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>With demand for the H1N1 vaccine dropping off, public health officials will decide within two days whether to offer the shots to the general public.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall, B.C. chief medical health officer, said demand for the vaccine has not been as high as expected this week, even with the broadening of eligibility criteria to including older children and youth, and first-responders, among other groups.</p>
<p>Island clinics saw similarly weak demand yesterday, reported Shannon Marshall, spokeswoman for the Vancouver Island Health Authority. If that continues, public health officials may opt to declare everyone eligible.</p>
<p>"I don't want vaccine sitting in fridges while people who are eligible don't come, but people who would like it just can't get it," said Kendall.</p>
<p>He noted the province has seen five new deaths associated with H1N1 since Nov. 10, including one on the Island. New severe cases of H1N1 infection total 144, Kendall said.</p>
<p>The Island death was a child from the Central Island under the age of five with underlying health conditions who died Monday.</p>
<p>Since April, when the first wave of the pandemic arrived -- the second wave took off in September -- the province has experienced 755 severe cases and 30 deaths associated with swine flu.</p>
<p>Of the deaths, 23 of the victims had underlying health conditions, such as asthma or diabetes, four had none and investigation continues in the other three cases.</p>
<p>Five of those who died most recently were between the ages of two and 19, four were 20 to 39, 15 were 40 to 64 and six were over the age of 65.</p>
<p>Kendall noted the age pattern demonstrates the difference between H1N1 and traditional seasonal flu, where the greatest number of deaths occur among seniors.</p>
<p>B.C. received 250,000 doses of the vaccine this week, and another 258,000 is expected next week.</p>
<p>Kendall speculated the drop in demand could be the result of bad weather or people allowing others to go first. Or it could be the result of complacency.</p>
<p>"In my view, complacency would be a mistake," said Kendall. "There is still the potential to see the same number of hospitalizations and deaths."</p>
<p>For the population to achieve a "herd immunity," immunization rates would have to be as high 75 to 80 per cent.</p>
<p>Right now, only about 20 per cent of British Columbians have been vaccinated, about 900,000 people.</p>
<p>But there is still good reason to keep vaccinating, even if the high levels seem out of reach, said Kendall.</p>
<p>"Even lower levels of immunity can blunt the impact of a wave of infection through a community," he said. "The more people you can cover, the more protection you can offer to the population."</p>
<p>Those eligible for the swine flu shot now include children and youth aged five to 18, health-care workers, police, first responders and people over the age of 65 with underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>Also still eligible are people under the age of 65 with chronic health conditions, children aged six months to four years, front-line health-care workers, people living in remote communities, native people on reserves and household contacts of people with depressed immune systems or infants under six months.</p>
<p>IN OTHER H1N1 NEWS:</p>
<p>- Thirty-six Canadians have experienced serious adverse reactions following their H1N1 vaccinations, Canada's chief public health officer said yesterday. One elderly person died after suffering a serious allergic reaction, Dr. David Butler-Jones reported. Most of the other cases involved allergic reactions, fever, and convulsions.</p>
<p>The 36 serious reactions were out of 6.6 million vaccinations.</p>
<p>- Butler Jones also acknowledged that if every Canadian were to heed the advice of public-health officials to get flu shots, there might not be enough vaccine available by Christmas -- contrary to earlier assurances from federal officials. "We should have enough by the end of the year for close to certainly 60 to 75 per cent of the population," he said.</p>
<p>"If 33 million wish to be immunized, then that may take us into January."</p>

</p>
<p>Two middle-aged Saskatchewan women with underlying health conditions have died of H1N1-related complications.</p>
<p>Dr. Saqib Shahab, the province's deputy chief medical health officer, confirmed the deaths on Tuesday. That brings to nine the number of deaths in Saskatchewan due to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Six females and three males have died from the virus, but Shahab noted all had serious underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>"We so far have not seen deaths in otherwise healthy people where H1N1 is the only cause," he said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Higher-than-normal levels of flu at this time of year have resulted in busy hospital emergency rooms across the province, particularly in Saskatoon and Regina, said Deborah Jordan, executive director of acute and emergency services with the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>Of the health regions that reported hospital admissions for influenza-like illness during the most recent 24-hour period measured, half were children of varying ages, Jordan said.</p>
<p>"There were approximately 25 to 30 new admissions within the most recent 24-hour reporting period for those regions who have reported, and we have reports in from about 75 per cent of the health regions," Jordan said.</p>
<p>The level of care the children require varies from site to site, she said.</p>
<p>"The majority are general pediatric ward admissions," Jordan said. "There are some admissions into pediatric intensive care. Typically, though, we're seeing that the stays there are relatively short. Children are stabilized and then returned to a general ward, and then subsequently discharged." During the weekend, an influenza assessment centre opened at St. Paul's Hospital in Saskatoon to relieve pressure on the city's emergency rooms.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Saskatoon was the only site in the province that had an assessment centre set up. The centre is expected to stay open until later this week.</p>
<p>The province received an additional 59,000 doses of vaccine on Monday, bringing the total to 320,400 doses received to date. When this vaccine is used, it will mean 34 per cent of the population will have been vaccinated against H1N1.</p>
<p>Shahab announced that Saskatchewan's H1N1 flu vaccination campaign has expanded this week to include people of all ages with underlying health conditions and students from Grade 7 to Grade 12.</p>
<p>Health officials hope there will be a higher number of vaccine doses in the next shipment, expected Monday.</p>
<p>"Hopefully, we will open the vaccine up for everyone either towards the end of the week of Nov. 23 or the beginning of the week of Nov. 30," Shahab said.</p>
<p>Provincial clinics are still vaccinating the previously announced high-risk categories, including health-care workers, pregnant and postpartum women (up to four weeks), and children from six months to Grade 6 who have not yet been immunized.</p>

</p>
<p>First in a three-part series.</p>
<p>A Saskatchewan radiologist billed the provincial medical plan a record $2.3 million last year, the most recent government figures say.</p>
<p>That's more than 10 times the amount earned by pediatricians, who earned an average of $206,500.</p>
<p>This huge income gap is affecting the choices of medical students, said Dr. William Albritton, dean of the University of Saskatchewan's college of medicine. All things being equal, students will gravitate to the more lucrative specialty, he said.</p>
<p>"I don't think there's any doubt it influences students. I can absolutely assure you of that," said Albritton, a pediatrician.</p>
<p>"The current system is not working. We are not producing the types of doctors we need." The next highest earner after the radiologist, who came in at $2,267,300, was an opthalmologist, at $1,430,700. Opthalmologists also had the highest average billing figures, at $837,700, according to Health Ministry figures, which cover the 2008-09 fiscal year. The ministry does not identify individual doctors.</p>
<p>"We treat eye disease. People value their eyes," said Dr. Lorne Bellan, president of the Canadian Opthalmological Society.</p>
<p>Bellan said efficiencies and technological advances allow opthalmologists to perform far more cataract surgeries or other procedures in a given day. That means more revenue, but it also means they're helping more people. And opthalmologists, like radiologists, have high overhead costs for equipment and other expenses other doctors might not have.</p>
<p>Bellan noted opthalmologists do not set their own fees. In Saskatchewan, the provincial government negotiates the size of the total pool of money available for doctors with the Saskatchewan Medical Association (SMA). The SMA then decides how much each piece of work will pay.</p>
<p>For years, most have agreed pediatricians are underpaid and things need to change. Consultations with children are often time-consuming, as they are with other lower-paying specialties such as psychiatry. Some doctors are now on salary or other forms of payment, but those who treat kids remain at the bottom of the pile.</p>
<p>A report this month revealed Saskatchewan is losing its only pediatric lung expert, Dr. Bryce Lothian, even though lung problems are the most common reason for child hospitalizations in the province. A recent review noted the death rate for Saskatchewan kids with asthma is 36 per cent higher than the national average.</p>
<p>Lothian cited heavy workload and the unfair payment structure as reasons for his resignation. Lothian staffed the Royal University Hospital pediatric intensive-care unit and had 250 other regular patients, with another 500 on his waiting list.</p>
<p>SMA president and Moose Jaw general surgeon Dr. George Miller said the amount earned by pediatricians is a problem that must be addressed.</p>
<p>"Pediatricians have been underpaid and undervalued for some time now. It's a dilemma we're wrestling with," Miller said.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, most opthalmologists and radiologists would accept less money in exchange for a decreased workload.</p>
<p>"They're working flat out. They are very efficient and are very good. I'm glad we have them," Miller said.</p>
<p>The SMA must also balance competition for specialists from other provinces and countries, as doctors are highly sought after and mobile, he said.</p>
<p>The SMA's agreement with the government expired in the fall, and the H1N1 flu issue has forced the two sides to put the issue aside for the time being. When a new deal is reached, neither Miller nor a Saskatchewan Health spokesperson could say whether dramatic changes in the fee structure would result.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Wildrose elbowing way into Alberta's politics</b>
</div><div>Jason Fekete   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>499 words</div><div>18 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A30</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>The newly minted Wildrose party seems to be growing like weeds in Alberta.</p>
<p>Former politicians and political observers alike believe conservative Alberta could be experiencing a once-in-a-generation shift in support that sees two provincial political parties fighting for a large number of votes on the centre-right flank.</p>
<p>Some argue it's a battle that could ultimately produce seismic change for the current Progressive Conservative government and opposition parties -- with right-wing vote splitting, a checkerboard political map or minority governments a distinct possibility.</p>
<p>"The possibility is there" for Wildrose to win the next election if Alberta's economy continues to struggle, said former provincial Social Credit MLA and Reform Party MP Ray Speaker.</p>
<p>But that doesn't necessarily mean only one of the two right-leaning parties can remain over the longer term.</p>
<p>There's more than enough small-c conservative support in Alberta for both the Wildrose and PC parties to survive, he predicted.</p>
<p>"There always has been room for two," he said.</p>
<p>The 73-year-old Albertan has experienced the shift of provincial conservative voters when they tire of the ruling party, and knows what sparks wholesale political change. He says some of the same ingredients that stirred up change in the past are present again today in provincial politics, with the emerging Wildrose Alliance challenging the governing Tories for right-of-centre support.</p>
<p>An Environics poll last month found the Wildrose Alliance is stealing support from the dynastic Tories and seriously challenging them as the favoured party in Alberta. In Calgary, Wildrose has actually overtaken the Conservatives in popular support.</p>
<p>Still, the bubble of support could just as easily pop if Wildrose doesn't cash in on sliding Tory support and captivate Alberta voters.</p>
<p>"The key thing is each of those parties have to carve out their vision for the province," Speaker said.</p>
<p>Discontent both within the party and general public has been building over Conservative Premier Ed Stelmach's handling of the economy, H1N1 flu vaccination rollout and new resource royalty framework, among other issues.</p>
<p>Ron Ghitter, a former senator and part of the provincial Tory class of 1971, said it's possible that Alberta could return to a period where both the government and main opposition challenger emerge from centre-right parties.</p>
<p>"Alberta will vote conservative. It's just the case of which shade of conservative it will be," Ghitter said. "It will come down to who has the best candidates." It was only 20 months ago the provincial Tories won 53 per cent of the vote in the provincial election and The Associated Pressparently -- wiped the Wildrose Alliance off the political map. Wildrose captured less than seven per cent of the popular vote and lost its only seat in the legislature.</p>
<p>However, in September the party won a byelection in Calgary.</p>

</p>
<p>Here is some H1N1 information from www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca], a Health Canada website, where you will be able to find out more about the flu.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is a new strain of pandemic influenza that is different from the seasonal flu. People have no natural immunity to protect against this virus. The H1N1 flu virus emerged in April 2009 and surveillance of its spread shows that it is affecting more young and healthy people than the regular seasonal flu, which normally affects seniors and young children. People with underlying medical conditions, and pregnant women, may be at a greater risk for severe illness.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus -- also known as human swine influenza -- is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs. This virus usually affects pigs, but has been transferred to humans.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus has caused primarily mild illness in Canada, but Canadians need to be prepared to respond to a potentially more severe form of the virus that may emerge this fall.</p>
<p>How is it spread?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is contagious and is spread the same way as regular seasonal influenza. This happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes and their germs enter the nose, eyes, or throat of another person. The germs can also rest on hard surfaces like counters and doorknobs, and can be picked up on hands and transmitted to the respiratory system when someone touches his mouth and/or nose. It is not possible to catch it by eating pork or pork products or through blood transfusions.</p>
<p>Contagiousness</p>
<p>More research is being done on how long a person can be infectious (be able to spread the virus to others), but it is believed that this period is for one day before the onset of symptoms and continues for approximately seven days after symptoms have started. The time it takes between being infected and experiencing symptoms is between two and seven days.</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>- Almost always</p>
<p>Cough and fever</p>
<p>- Common</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle aches</p>
<p>Sore throat</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>Decreased appetite</p>
<p>Runny nose</p>
<p>- Sometimes</p>
<p>Nausea</p>
<p>Vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>- Wash hands often.</p>
<p>- Keep common surfaces disinfected.</p>
<p>- Cough and sneeze into your arm, instead of into your hand.</p>
<p>- If you are sick, stay home until your symptoms are gone and you feel well enough to participate in all activities.</p>
<p>- If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant, have underlying health problems, or if your symptoms get worse, contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant or have underlying health problems contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are otherwise healthy, you should stay home to recover. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience difficulty breathing or serious shortness of breath, it is important to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Antivirals are drugs used for the early treatment of influenza. If taken shortly after getting sick (within 48 hours), they can reduce influenza symptoms, shorten the length of illness and potentially reduce the serious complications of influenza. Antivirals do not prevent you from getting sick.</p>
<p>Canada has a National Antiviral Stockpile of 55 million doses of two antiviral drugs -- Tamiflu and Relenza. Both are effective in treating H1N1 flu virus. This stockpile is enough for all Canadians who will need and want treatment.</p>
<p>Antivirals are recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe illness, and for people at risk of severe disease. Your doctor will decide if treatment is right for you.</p>
<p>Vaccination</p>
<p>Influenza vaccines (also called flu shots) help you to prevent getting sick by introducing your body to a weakened or dead version of the virus to teach your body to build immunity to it.</p>

</p>
<p>Question: If I receive the H1N1 immunization shot, how long will I have immunity to the H1N1 virus -- four months, six months, one year or forever?</p>
<p>Example: If the H1N1 virus is around next fall/winter, will I have to receive another H1N1 immunization shot next fall?</p>
<p>Answer: It takes approximately two weeks for your body to develop immunity from the vaccine. The immunity from an influenza vaccine will last through a flu season (several months). However partial immunity can continue for a much longer period. It is likely the H1N1 vaccine will become a component of the seasonal influenza vaccine for the 2010-11 influenza season.</p>

<p>If you're feeling sick, don't visit health-care facilities -- stay away.</p>
<p>That's the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region's prescription for protecting patients in hospitals and residents in long-term facilities.</p>
<p>Though nothing specific prompted the warning, region spokesman Mark Torjusen said it's important to protect the vulnerable.</p>
<p>"What experience has taught the people within the system is that when we have outbreaks on our nursing units, more often than not it's the result of somebody who has come in from the community when they're ill," Torjusen said.</p>
<p>"With H1N1 fairly widespread within the community and across the province, this is a way of trying to minimize the risk of people bringing it into the facility when they come in to visit."</p>
<p>Anyone with a fever, cough, sore throat, vomiting or diarrhea is asked not to visit friends or family in a hospital or long-term facility.</p>
<p>Healthy visitors are reminded to wash their hands before visiting health-care facilities and use the hand-sanitizing gels at the public entrances to the building and on individual nursing units.</p>
<p>Visitor restrictions are in place on the following nursing units at Regina General Hospital and Pasqua Hospital:</p>
<p>Regina General Hospital</p>
<p>Labour and Birth Unit -- Visitors restricted to:</p>
<p>- Partner</p>
<p>- Labour coach or support person</p>

<p>Re: Calgary Catholic Churches Alter Communion As H1N1 Precaution, Nov. 16.</p>
<p>A 2004 papal document states that "the faithful always has the right to receive Holy Communion on the tongue." Some dioceses are not allowing Communion hosts to be placed directly on the tongue due to their H1N1 concerns.</p>
<p>Many believe taking Holy Communion on the hand is more likely to transmit infection. It is impractical to keep church door handles, pews, prayer cards and hymn books germ free, as all are handled routinely. Even if sanitizing lotions are available at church entrances, once the aforementioned surfaces are subsequently touched, communicants are required to engage in hand-finger-mouth contact.</p>
<p>Dioceses that insist on reception via hands may not have received the best advice. For those who have never received on the hand, the current removal of a right is very painful.</p>

<p>The federal government should be funding the translation of H1N1 materials beyond English and French, the opposition Liberals say.</p>
<p>In the House of Commons yesterday, the Liberals renewed their calls for the government to do more to help the provinces and territories, and local public health units, deliver the swine flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Ottawa should be helping to cover the costs for more public health nurses, for example, so that more vaccines can be administered more quickly, said Liberal health critic Carolyn Bennett, who was also critical about the government's communication plan.</p>
<p>"Across the country we are hearing again and again, the lack of information in languages that Canadians can understand, in the 60, 70 languages that need to be there, that it is folly to just hand a press release or an information package out to ethnic media, expect them to do the translation."</p>

<p>An investigation is under way in Quebec after two nurses were found to have taken doses of the H1N1 flu vaccine home to vaccinate family members.</p>
<p>The North Shore health agency said the information came to light Friday and the investigation would in part serve to determine whether other nurses there were responsible for similar actions.</p>
<p>"The fact there are priority groups to respect ... this caused concern, as well as the fact that vaccines were taken out and brought home - that's not what they're supposed to do," said Pascal Paradis, spokesman for the North Shore health agency - which covers areas north of the St. Lawrence in eastern Quebec.</p>

<div>758 words</div><div>17 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>If you're bringing your kids, bring treats to reward them. If you're an adult, bring an iPod or a magazine. And wear a shirt with a sleeve that's easily lifted - in public. An H1N1 vaccination centre is no place for wardrobe malfunctions.</p>
<p>Those are just a few basic tips if you're planning to get your H1N1 vaccination at the Palais des congrès, where a mass inoculation centre capable of jabbing 320 people an hour opened yesterday. But this advice probably holds true for all 17 vaccination centres now open on Montreal Island.</p>
<p>The Gazette followed a family of four yesterday through the process at the Palais. Underground parking is free at the Palais, if you show proof of vaccination.</p>
<p>Marianne Regnault, 36, and Lawrence Colsell, 37, arrived with their children Kim, 51/2, and Alex, 4, at about 8:15 a.m.</p>
<p>Get your coupon: Look for yellow- or orange-jacketed health care workers, usually holding clipboards and stationed at the front of a cordoned-off waiting line area. The Regnault-Colsell family got coupons for 9 a.m. but since hardly anyone was in line they were able to get in at 8:30. "We played a bit with the kids and then we got in," said Regnault. "It was easy."</p>
<p>From the time you enter the clinic, the process should take no more than 30 to 60 minutes. However, the lag between when you get your coupon and when you gain entrance may stretch for a few or more hours, so be prepared to run errands, have a coffee or even go home and come back.</p>
<p>Show your ID: Upon entering the clinic by showing your coupon, you will be escorted to a registration area. You'll need your Quebec health insurance card or another proof of Quebec residency, like your driver's license. You should state what priority group you are part of but you are not obliged to say what your chronic illness is, if any, at this point.</p>
<p>Sign the form: Explanation sheets about H1N1 and the vaccine are available in English, French and seven other languages. Read and sign the consent form.</p>
<p>Watch the video: A seven-minute video in French with English subtitles further explains things. Regnault watched while her daughter explained that she brought along two stuffed animals for support. "This is Nounou and this Doudou," Kim said.</p>
<p>Ask specific questions: If you have questions about your health situation and getting the shot, ask to speak to a health care worker.</p>
<p>"Kim had some bad nose bleeds a few months back," and has been on medication for it, her mother told a clinic worker.</p>
<p>"It's all right," a nurse replied. "There are no contra-indications (adverse drug effects) for that with the vaccine."</p>
<p>Get vaccinated: You'll be escorted to an area with several vaccination tables and nurses and syringes. Sit down and tell the nurse what your chronic condition is, if any.</p>
<p>Alex, sitting in his mom's lap, was the first in his family to get the shot. He didn't cry. Kim watched him and then bawled as the nurse planted the needle in her arm. But she quickly stopped when a nurse gave her a sticker of a little girl that looked like her.</p>
<p>Nurses disinfect their hands between each patient and most do not use gloves; there is no rule saying they must. "It's much easier this way," one nurse said.</p>
<p>Wait for 15 minutes: The final stop before leaving allows clinic workers to observe you for 15 minutes, enough time to see if you develop a rare allergic reaction.</p>
<p>Mostly, the side effect of the shot is a sore arm for a few days. Some may experience muscle and joint pain.</p>
<p>Kim and Alex were enjoying the candies their parents had promised them. Later they were rewarded with chocolate doughnuts. "Back to kindergarten and daycare," Regnault said, patting her kids' heads. "It was fine."</p>

<p>Toronto --</p>
<p>With stocks of vaccine piling up and line-ups fading, health agencies across the Greater Toronto Area are beginning to open up H1N1 vaccination programs to the general public.</p>
<p>Open-door vaccination programs will begin Wednesday at all the clinics in the City of Toronto, as well as Durham, York and Halton regions. Peel Region will follow suit on Thursday.</p>
<p>The decision puts the GTA ahead of most other major metropolitan areas in the country, including Ottawa, Calgary and Vancouver, which are all still focusing on vaccinating priority groups.</p>
<p>David McKeown, Toronto's medical officer of health, said the supplies of vaccine and short line-ups makes it appropriate to open the doors.</p>
<p>“We still have both capacity in the clinics and vaccine for more,” he said in a phone interview. “I hope we'll see more people. I hope we'll see busier clinics, because we'll get more vaccine into people.”</p>
<p>Though demand appears to be waning, he urged Toronto residents to not become complacent about getting the shot.</p>
<p>“In Toronto, we are still seeing H1N1 influenza still circulating. As long as its still circulating, it's still a good idea to be immunized,” Dr. McKeown said.</p>
<p>Some doctors' offices also have stocks of the vaccine, and Dr. McKeown recommended people determine their family doctor's supply before attending a public clinic.</p>
<p>Toronto Public Health has vaccinated about 85,000 people so far. About 400,000 doses of the vaccine have been distributed across the Greater Toronto Area.</p>
<p>The move by the GTA follows other Ontario regions that have opened their doors to the general public, including Thunder Bay last week and Hamilton and Kingston on Monday.</p>
<p>Among the regions also allowing full access are Niagara, Peterborough, Haliburton Kawartha Pine Ridge, and the Northwestern Health Unit, Other Ontario regions still restricting access to priority groups include the City of Ottawa, the Region of Waterloo, and the Middlesex-London Health Unit.</p>
<p>For clinic hours and restrictions in your area, check with your local health unit.</p>
<p>Ontario has moved more quickly than other provinces to open doors. In British Columbia, health officials said they'd decide on opening eligibility by the end of the week.</p>
<p>Provincial Health Officer Perry Kendall said he may make that move because a number of at-risk people who are eligible for a shot have not been flooding in as expected.</p>
<p>“Demand clearly isn't what it was two weeks ago,” Dr. Kendall said. “If we continue to see that the people that we've opened it up for, for their eligibility, aren't coming forward, I would like to open up the clinics ? more broadly so that anybody who wants the vaccine can come forward.”</p>

</p>
<p>WINNIPEG</p>
<p>The country's chief public health officer says Canada is leading the world when it comes to the percentage of its citizens vaccinated against the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones says about 20 per cent of the population has received the H1N1 shot in the last three weeks. Canada has about 33 million people.</p>
<p>"That's just unheard of," he said in an interview while he was attending an international conference on HIV/AIDS in Winnipeg on Monday. "Already we've immunized more people than anybody else in the world as a percentage of our population."</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq told the House of Commons some jurisdictions will have completed their vaccinations by the end of this week.</p>
<p>"We had said all along that we were trying to complete the vaccination program by December. In fact, we were early in the rollout of our campaign across the country," she said. "By the end of this week, we will have over 10.4 million vaccines in provinces and territories."</p>
<p>Up to 95 per cent of the people in some remote northern Manitoba reserves, which were given priority because they were hit particularly hard when H1N1 hit in April, had received shots as of last week.</p>
<p>At least 161 Canadians have died from the virus since it surfaced in the spring. But Butler-Jones said Canada hasn't suffered as much as other countries.</p>
<p>"Every death is tragic, but the fact that we've had as few deaths as we've had and as few serious cases is testimony to everybody working to address this disease," he said. "This is actually a model of success."</p>
<p>The vaccine rollout has come under serious criticism since immunization clinics opened across the country a few weeks ago. Although pregnant women were considered a top priority, the vaccine that was recommended for expectant mothers had to be shipped from Australia.</p>
<p>Other people waited hours in lengthy lineups at mass immunization clinics. Some - such as Calgary Flames hockey players - jumped the queue in Alberta and were given the shot privately. Many clinics across the country had to shut down entirely for days because of a national vaccine shortage.</p>
<p>Despite that shortfall, some vaccine has had to be thrown out because of its short shelf life. Officials with some of the larger health districts, including Toronto and Halifax, say they have tossed about one per cent of their vaccine because it had expired.</p>
<p>In Manitoba, a shipment of 1,000 doses was wasted after it was stored in a freezer instead of a refrigerator.</p>
<p>Despite initial problems, Butler-Jones said vaccine shipments are now flowing well, which will mean even more people will be eligible to get the shot soon.</p>
<p>There will be several million doses available this week and another three million doses are expected next week, he said.</p>

<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>While some Ontario communities are beginning to offer the H1N1 vaccine to the general public, this week's clinics in Waterloo Region are only open to those on the recently expanded priority list.</p>
<p>Ontario's Ministry of Health said Monday there's no set date to offer the flu shots to the public, but nearly 10 local health units say they've got enough vaccine on hand and are now accepting anyone.</p>
<p>Those communities include Hamilton, Kingston, Niagara, Haldimand-Norfolk, Timmins, Algoma, Kenora and Simcoe Muskoka. The health unit in Cornwall expects to begin offering the shots to everyone Thursday.</p>
<p>Region of Waterloo Public Health confirmed three clinics scheduled for this week for the priority group, on top of the Monday clinic held at Kitchener City Hall.</p>
<p>This week's clinics:</p>
<p>Tuesday: Wilmot Recreation Complex at 1291 Nafziger Rd., New Hamburg, from 2 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Wednesday: Elmira District Secondary School at 4 University Ave. W., Elmira, from 2 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Thursday: Preston High Secondary School at 550 Rose Ave., Cambridge, 2 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Eligibility was expanded by public health Friday.</p>
<p>People now eligible for the vaccine include: children six months to under 19 years; people 19 and older with chronic medical conditions; health-care workers including firefighters, police and emergency medical service staff; pregnant women; household contacts and care providers of people at higher risk who cannot be immunized (children under six months) or who may not respond to vaccines (people who are immune compromised).</p>
<p>Upcoming clinics dates are available on public health's automated line at 519-883-2324.</p>
<p>Pregnant women can get an unadjuvanted vaccine by calling their doctor or the health unit at 519-883-2272 for an appointment.</p>

<p>After all, seasonal flu supposedly kills between 4,000 to 8,000 Canadians and between 250,000 and 500,000 people worldwide each year. Yet as of late last week, H1N1 had killed 161 Canadians and an estimated 6,260 people around the globe.</p>
<p>Critics of Canada's pandemic response point to the discrepancy between those sets of numbers, but those two sets of numbers count different things, experts say.</p>
<p>Jordan Ellenberg, an associate professor of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin, explained the problem in an article published online in Slate Magazine earlier this year.</p>
<p>"If you want to compare the number of confirmed deaths to seasonal flu to the number of confirmed deaths from H1N1, OK, you can do that," he says in an interview. But you can't compare the number of confirmed H1N1 deaths to an estimate of seasonal flu deaths.</p>
<p>The frequent attempts to equate the two talliesirritate Dr. Kumanan Wilson.</p>
<p>Wilson is an expert in public health policy as well as an internal medicine physician at the Ottawa Health Research Institute. "Nobody has seen a flu season like this on the ground level," he says. "If you talk to any frontline worker, they've never seen anything like this. And we keep getting told this is nothing."</p>
<p>Wilson says it is "disingenuous" to criticize the response to this pandemic by comparing the low death toll to the substantially higher estimates of seasonal flu deaths. "I feel it underplays the significance of this."</p>
<p>But what is the difference between counting confirmed flu deaths one by one and estimating seasonal flu death tolls? The answer lies in the way flu kills and the way statisticians try to assess those deaths.</p>
<p>Influenza does kill some people directly. But in most cases, influenza contributes to or hastens death. A bout of flu can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease. But the cause of death is likely to be listed as a heart attack.</p>
<p>A lot of seasonal flu doesn't get recorded in official reports of deaths and hospitalizations. Not everyone dies in hospital. Hospitals don't always test for influenza. And even if they do, if the test isn't done early enough in the infection, the test may come back negative.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Giving it their best shot; Two French school boards in Laval get the jump on Montreal counterparts</b>
</div><div>DAVID JOHNSTON   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>455 words</div><div>17 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Two French-language school boards in the Montreal suburbs have moved ahead of other boards in the metropolitan region in the hurry to give schoolchildren the H1N1 vaccine as quickly as they can.</p>
<p>The Commission scolaire de Laval started overseeing their own vaccinations yesterday, ahead of all other boards. Children from two high schools got their vaccines, while students from another two high schools are to get theirs today.</p>
<p>In Longueuil, the Commission scolaire Marie-Victorin, which covers schools in Longueuil, St. Lambert and Brossard, is to start vaccinating students on Thursday.</p>
<p>Today is the deadline for Marie-Victorin students age 13 and under to hand in parental-permission forms to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Montreal region, progress has been slow. Most school boards in the Montreal area are waiting until after a big planning meeting tomorrow with public-health authorities before creating their own schedules, according to Mike Cohen, an official of the English Montreal School Board.</p>
<p>Laval's largest school board got a jump on other boards because it was able to anticipate early last week that the provincial government was poised to open up the vaccination process last last week to healthy school children, said a board official yesterday.</p>
<p>The official, Jean-Pierre Archambault, said in an interview that 55 per cent of 1,000 students at École L'Odyssée-des-Jeunes, a middle school for Secondary 1 and 2 students, received their vaccines yesterday. At the École d'éducation internationale de Laval, 65 per cent of 1,600 students were vaccinated.</p>
<p>Board officials will be looking today at why the other 45 and 35 per cent weren't vaccinated. But Archambault said it appears that large numbers of healthy Laval children were already vaccinated last week.</p>
<p>This is because Laval's two vaccination centres went ahead and started jabbing children age 5 to 19 last week before the rest of Quebec did, Archambault said.</p>
<p>L'Odyssée and Laval's international school were selected first for vaccinations yesterday because they are the closest Laval high schools to the two H1N1 vaccination centres that have been set up in Laval. Students walked there for their vaccines yesterday, under close escort from school officials and parents. School buses will be used to transport other Laval schoolchildren.</p>
<p>The Laval board plans to finish up vaccinating 13,000 high school students by early next week. The board's elementary school students are scheduled to get their shots beginning on Wednesday of next week. By then, most boards on Montreal Island will likely have begun their own programs.</p>

<p>Whenever the lineup of kids and parents in front of his chair thins out a little, the Santa Claus working Edmonton's Southgate Mall hoists a fuzzy red and green sack over the arm of his chair and pulls out hand sanitizer, throat spray, extra white gloves and tissues.</p>
<p>"Everybody's very conscious," Santa said. With their parents taking afternoons off and queuing for hours to get their children vaccinated, Santa knows he can't be too careful. No one wants a stocking full of swine flu for Christmas.</p>
<p>The mall has set up two extra hand sanitizing stations at the entrance and exit of Santa's Village this year to prevent the spread of H1N1 and seasonal flu, said mall general manager Paul Fairbridge.</p>
<p>Cleaning staff visit the Santa display a minimum of four times a day to clean high-contact areas such as railings and the arms of Santa's chair. Santa's suit is cleaned at least once a week and is sanitized every day, Fairbridge said.</p>
<p>Fairbridge strongly encouraged all Southgate staff, Santa included, to get the H1N1 vaccine, but said it remains a personal choice. And if your child is sick, Santa would just as soon hear his Christmas wishes a little later in the season.</p>
<p>"The best thing at this stage of the game if kids aren't feeling well, the best thing to do is stay home," he said. "Santa Claus is here right until the 23rd . . . if they're not feeling great today, stay home and come back another day."</p>
<p>Southgate's Santa hasn't noticed any kids showing flu symptoms since the display opened on Saturday. Even if he did, he would never say anything to the child's parents, he said.</p>
<p>"That's the parents' responsibility. Our job is to produce magic," he said.</p>
<p>Santas who graduate from Calgary's Santa School have always been encouraged to take precautions such as washing their beards regularly and bleaching and washing their white gloves every night during flu season, but more Santas seem to be taking the advice to heart this year, said Santa School head elf Jennifer Andrews.</p>
<p>"Santas have always been around hundreds, sometimes thousands of kids and people every season, so we've always recommended they use stringent techniques," Andrews said. "Santas that have the luxury of having elves with them . . . elves love handing out candy canes just as easily as they can hand out hand sanitizer."</p>
<p>Santas are instructed to stay at home if they show flu symptoms, said Special Events Digital Photo owner Dean Skoubis, who runs all of the Santa displays at all of Edmonton's malls.</p>
<p>"We've got a lot of guys available -- there's no fear of a shortage of Santas this year," he said.</p>

<div>For The Calgary Herald</div>
<div>889 words</div><div>17 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>I'm not going to tell you and your family to get or not get the H1N1 vaccine. You have to decide that for yourselves.</p>
<p>If you are among those anti-immunization conspiracy theorists who have convinced themselves the vaccinations are more deadly than the virus, I will say, get over yourself.</p>
<p>I receive about half a dozen e-mails a day from panicky protesters who are firmly convinced the H1N1 scare is a plot.</p>
<p>They want me to watch <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> videos by the Finnish health minister-- or, at least, someone they claim is the Finnish health minister--alleging the vaccine is unsafe and that major western governments know it's unsafe, but are distributing it anyway.</p>
<p>I've also been told the "deadly vaccine" is a tool to reduce worldwide population. The shots give you the flu and that is what kills you.</p>
<p>But I'm not talking about that. It is not because I am anti-immunization that I wrote above I was unwilling to recommend the vaccine to you.</p>
<p>I wrote that because within our family we are undecided about what to do, too.</p>
<p>I am leaning toward not getting myself and my kids vaccinated; my wife is leaning toward having it done. I suspect a lot of others are similarly torn.</p>
<p>According to most public health experts interviewed this week, we are about four weeks into the second wave of swine flu infections-- the first wave having occurred in April and May.</p>
<p>This marks the halfway point in the typical second-wave infection.</p>
<p>There is no way of knowing whether this flu strain will be typical, but if it is, we are near the peak of infection and have about four more weeks for this wave to work its way through the population.</p>
<p>It will be a week or more before my family and I are eligible for shots.</p>
<p>None of us, thankfully, has any underlying medical conditions that make us high-risk patients.</p>
<p>Since it can take two weeks after receiving the shot for recipients to become immune, it might be four weeks from now before we can receive the vaccine and have it become fully active.</p>
<p>Having the shot couldn't hurt--my wife's position-- but then again, why bother--my position--if the risk will have passed by the time we can do anything about it?</p>
<p>There is also the fact that the risk is almost infinitesimally small.</p>
<p>The death rate from H1N1 still has not approached the rate from a typical seasonal flu. This may be because H1N1 is deadly to different groups than most seasonal varieties. When it kills, it kills younger and seemingly healthy people; seasonal viruses tend to kill the very old and very young.</p>
<p>Maybe the H1N1 rate is lower precisely because it attacks younger, more robust people. If it threatened the same groups as a season flu, maybe its death rate would be equally high.</p>
<p>But its preference for younger victims is also why swine flu has the broader population panicked--or did.</p>
<p>Plenty of older people and some very young children die each year from the garden-variety influenza. But because of their inherent increased vulnerability, we seem to write their deaths off as expected, in a cold, analytical way.</p>
<p>Perhaps what has the broader population spooked for their own safety is the possibility they might succumb to swine flu, where they likely wouldn't be susceptible to the annual Asian flu. They read stories about 13-year-old hockey players dying and 38-year-old chemists and it hits home in a way that reading about the death of an 86-year-old great-grandmother with emphysema does not.</p>
<p>That may sound callous, but it is human nature. We relate more to people in circumstances similar to our own.</p>
<p>Even so, the risk of contracting a fatal case of H1N1 is rare. Most people who contract it will be less sick than if they had a typical seasonal flu.</p>
<p>But for some few individuals-- and here is the fact that feeds my indecision-- H1N1 will bond with tissue deep in the lungs to produce a pneumonia that chokes off the body's ability to absorb oxygen.</p>
<p>There is no way of knowing whether you are one of the unlucky few in whom H1N1 will produce such a reaction.</p>
<p>Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief medical officer of health, who is helping with his province's H1N1 immunization program, told the Globe and Mail this week "this is the most overhyped, overblown exercise I've ever been a part of. We continue to lavish resources on a problem that is just not that big."</p>
<p>The national price tag is likely to be well over $2 billion for immunization alone.</p>
<p>But then again, there is the case of Edmontonian Sean Calder, who got the shot at Bonnie Doon Mall this week.</p>
<p>He got immunized, he told a reporter, because he has a one-month-old son and because he has a brother-in-law so sick with swine flu that he is in hospital.</p>
<p>Each Albertan has to decide if there is a similar risk to his or her family.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Victoria teachers walk out over risk of H1N1; Refusal to work leads to inspection</b>
</div><div>Janet Steffenhagen   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>

</p>
<p>A few teachers recently refused to work in B.C. public schools because they said the prevalence of H1N1 illness among students had created an unsafe workplace.</p>
<p>The work refusals happened late last month by pregnant teachers in Victoria who walked away from their classrooms -- two at Arbutus middle school and one at George Jay elementary.</p>
<p>Another report was filed this month by a Prince George teacher.</p>
<p>By law, employees have a right to refuse work if there is a reasonable cause to believe it poses a health or safety hazard.</p>
<p>The Victoria teachers' claims of unsafe work prompted an onsite inspection by WorkSafeBC.</p>
<p>The probe was to determine if the schools had implemented a proper "exposure control plan" to minimize the risk of H1N1 infection, Ray Roch, a WorkSafe BC regional director who handles H1N1 issues, explained in an interview Monday.</p>
<p>With a proper exposure control plan, the H1N1 risk for employees will likely be lower than the risk in the general community, he added. Such plans should include daily efforts to identify and isolate students who have coughs and fevers as well as those whose immediate family members are ill.</p>
<p>The inspectors in Victoria also reviewed materials submitted by the teachers' union, but concluded that the schools did not pose an undue hazard. In fact, Roch said that as of Monday, inspections had not identified a single worksite in any sector that was hazardous due to the virus.</p>
<p>The B.C. Public School Employers' Association has advised school districts that based on the WorkSafe BC findings, "it will not be deemed to be unsafe for a pregnant teacher to go to work in the classroom where the potential to contract H1N1 exists."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the B.C. Teachers' Federation is urging members who are pregnant or have compromised immune systems to take steps to protect themselves if there is a high rate of infection in their schools. Union vice-president Susan Lambert said the first action should be a request for reassignment to reduce exposure to the virus.</p>
<p>If that's refused, the union advises them to refuse to work, Lambert said. But only at schools where there is an outbreak.</p>
<p>Anne Guthrie Warman, president of the Vancouver Secondary Teachers' Association, suggested teachers should not be discouraged from making a claim because of the recent WorkSafe BC rulings. Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, she said.</p>
<p>It hasn't been a problem in Vancouver, she noted, because the district is accommodating requests for reassignment.</p>
<p>Scott McCloy, a WorkSafe BC spokesman, said the organization understands that pregnant women are worried about H1N1.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 hysteria eases amid Grit fearmongering</b>
</div><div>Don Martin   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>681 words</div><div>17 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>The H1N1 germs are still spreading, but the pandemic's potential to cause a bad political reaction has peaked.</p>
<p>The spectre of mask-wrapped commuters in rush hour, young victims gasping through ventilator shortages in overcrowded intensive care units and arenas doubling as emergency morgues in some grisly 1918 plague re-enactment have given way to semi-orderly immunization lineups and a renewed burst of vaccine deliveries this week.</p>
<p>There's a palpable easing of the public health hysteria which was inflicting so much distress on the government for most of the past month, although that was clearly news to the Liberals.</p>
<p>The Official Opposition may have been operating under new office management on Monday, but you would've never known it by their same old question period fearmongering laced with half-truths, a tactic perhaps more symptomatic of party desperation than anything dramatically new on the health file.</p>
<p>For starters, they warned, the immunization completion date will be delayed by several months and could extend into February.</p>
<p>This is patently false-- minister Leona Aglukkaq says it's still on track for completion by Christmas and notes some jurisdictions will be finished their rollout this week--and it does nothing but heighten anxiety among Canadians and add panic to the lineups of parents seeking to ensure their kids have the shot.</p>
<p>The Liberals also seem to be boosting flu figures for dramatic effect by saying there have been at least 41 deaths in the past week and 190 deaths. The latest information on the public health agency websites posts 20 deaths in the past week and 135 in total.</p>
<p>They also forget to add context to statistics which are obviously tragic for the victims, but hardly worthy of epidemic-driven panic in a country where weekly H1N1 deaths are now roughly a third of the average traffic fatality count.</p>
<p>If the H1N1 has "overwhelmed many hospital ICUs," as the Liberals allege, that's news to the media although, to be fair, that could happen if the pandemic worsens.</p>
<p>And as if to underline that their scare tactics are getting thin, the Liberals say ethnic communities could be suffering from health-care ignorance because the federal government has failed to translate vaccine program information into many languages.</p>
<p>Speaking of lost in translation, can anyone figure out what class-act Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett means by this when answering a question on the number of parliamentarians affected by H1N1? "I'm not aware that I've been asked to keep track of absenteeism in my office so without real numbers or without taking this seriously, this is a problem." Well OK then . . .</p>
<p>It's time to downplay the spin doctors and concentrate on medical facts as this pandemic reaches what seems to be a weaker-than-predicted peak.</p>
<p>Prevailing expert opinion is that the odds of dying from this H1N1 bug are the same as any run-of-the-mill flu and may indeed be considerably less by the time the mass immunization is done which, it's safe to predict, will happen earlier than predicted and probably by mid-December.</p>
<p>While chief public health officer David Butler-Jones has been alarmist in some of his comments, suggesting it will infect more than a quarter of the population when it's currently around eight per cent, it's better to err on the side of precaution than to dismiss any oncoming pandemic with a shrug and crossed fingers.</p>
<p>When the federal government does its post-mortem on future pandemic planning, it will obviously have to restructure the vaccine delivery process and expand the number of suppliers to ensure a domestic supply of pandemic and season flu vaccines can be produced at the same time.</p>
<p>But the best medical advice to avoid catching this flu bug would be to continue pumping gobs of hand sanitizer at every opportunity, cough into your elbow and, to reduce the stress of waiting for the vaccine, avoid listening to Liberals.</p>

</p>
<p>While highly contagious and more severe in its symptoms than other colds or flu, unless it mutates, H1N1 will kill only a few.</p>
<p>However, there are many lessons to be learned from this round of preventative treatment. In the education business, we would refer to this as an LES or a "learning evaluation situation."</p>
<p>When the real, more deadly variety of a pandemic strikes, we cannot afford to be late in administering preventive care. We cannot afford the social instability that line-jumpers would cause when death toll would be in the hundreds of thousands or millions. We cannot afford the suspicion and subsequent chaos that would occur when government, unsure from one day to the next, changes its mind as to who should be on the priority list. When one in four people are dying around us, will line-jumping hockey players or medical-board members have the courage to show their faces in public?</p>
<p>As earthquakes go, this is but a tremor. Nonetheless, if anything good comes from this three-on-the-Richter-scale of pandemics, we will be much better prepared when it is a Level 7 or 8. Get your vaccine when you can and be thankful - it could have been far worse. Pray that government has taken advantage of this learning curve, and will do better on the next test, when the margin for error might not be so generous.</p>

<p>My name is John Treggett and I worked for the Quebec government for 27 years. I recently retired and I get the feeling that the Quebec government would like to see me and everyone else over 65 drop dead ASAP. The swine flu is a great chance for government to have that happen.</p>
<p>I don't know too many people 65 or older who don't have some kind of underlying health problem. We came from generations of smokers, asbestos miners, and other unhealthy backgrounds. So what's the deal? Should the over-65 crowd wait politely in line dragging their own coffins with them?</p>

<p>- Apparently the H1N1 immunization clinic at Bonnie Doon Mall is closing. It has to make way for the seasonal H0H0 inoculations. - Some people stood in line for three hours to get a free item at Kingsway Mall. I trust they're not the same ones who complained about having to stand in line for three hours to get the free flu shot. - Would any of the folks complaining about the wait for vaccine like to trade places with the ones waiting for chemotherapy? That wait is nearly as hopeless. - There is no cause to complain about the downtown Christmas decorations being up already. Would you like to put them up when it's- 20 C? - Does The Journal's Paula Simons honestly believe Edmonton has a cafe district?I nearly fell off my chair laughing over that one. - The folks at city hall can't even stop street people from drinking out of their hand-sanitizer dispensers. How are they going to solve the homeless problem?</p>
<p> - Edmonton's downtown revitalization will always be a pipe dream until it gets a handle on the homeless and panhandling problems. - While pressing council for more funding, I trust EPS Chief Mike Boyd realizes the$2 billion spent on the federal gun registry he once endorsed as useful could have been diverted to give every force in the country a considerable funding boost. - If Edmonton wants to be world-class, forget about the Expo and concentrate on the basics: Building the LRT and keeping the streets clear of snow. - Council should look at why the streetcars were removed from Stony Plain Road before bringing them back. - Taxi drivers at the International Airport have had it too good for too long. If the proposed ETS route to the airport means less business for them, tough. - There are more than 220 species of birds at Big Lake, including Trumpeter swans. By the time the developers are finished with it, the only birds left will be crows and magpies. What a waste. - Relax, folks. Anyone who is involved in stock contracting for rodeos knows those animals represent money. They get better treatment than the cowboys. - So, Lucy the elephant is 1,000 pounds overweight. What happened, did she get married? - Evidently Robert Latimer's second application for parole has been rejected. Maybe if he killed someone in cold blood rather than out of love, he would have been free by now. - Gary Lamphier's analysis in The Journal of the U.S. banking system was brilliant. I get so tired of President Obama shaking his finger at the rest of the world. - Many Afghans need better health care because of NATO. Invasions are never good for one's health. - The Alberta government is going to help build a$ 26-million film studio outside Calgary at a time when the annual deficit is close to$7 billion? Politics and influence trump finances and common sense every time. - Drivers who complete the two-year probation period under the graduated licence program without any tickets or accidents should be exempt from taking the driver's exam and paying the$200 fee. Their probation period was the test. - Shame on the drivers who honked and yelled at me when I accidentally stalled my car's standard transmission in the intersection. They forget everyone was a new driver at one time. - Nobody was surprised at the reception the Royals received in Quebec. So why go there? They should visit Alberta instead. - So the royal tour is finally over. Now I can get back to watching paint dry?</p>

<p>Regarding the problems with H1N1 vaccine doses, who gave instructions to have the regular flu vaccine done at the same time?</p>
<p>It is obvious that there is very little medical experience in Ron Liepert's department, and Liepert himself has no medical background, so who is in charge at Alberta Health and Wellness?</p>
<p>Having the regular flu vaccine given at the same time as H1N1 vaccine increased the waiting by almost double. Each person who had both vaccines, required two separate needles. According to this government their plan was not to rank H1N1 as a high priority.</p>

<p>The fall sitting of the legislature resumed on Monday after a week-long break.</p>
<p>And it would seem absolutely nobody returned to work energized or with a spring in their step.</p>
<p>It's as if the break never happened or that everyone used the week to watch reruns of Lost.</p>
<p>Here is the underwhelming opening salvo in question period between Liberal Leader David Swann and Premier Ed Stelmach:</p>
<p>Swann: "Last week the premier publicly admitted there were mistakes in the H1N1 rollout this past month. To the premier: Will the premier explain what mistakes were made?"</p>
<p>Stelmach: "Mr. Speaker, the comment last week with respect to the rollout of H1N1 vaccination said that, yes, that first week we could have accommodated people in buildings, so they didn't have to wait outside. Although it wasn't that cold, it certainly could have been a lot colder at this time of year. We've learned from the situation."</p>
<p>Swann's second question was so old, politically speaking, it should have been delivered via carrier pigeon: "Was it the premier's decision</p>
<p>or the health minister's decision to send an ambiguous message about who qualified for the vaccine in the first week?"</p>
<p>It's just further evidence that anything worth watching in Alberta politics probably isn't worth watching in the legislature. That's not to say there's absolutely nothing going on under the dome. There are a few flickers of life but it's a bit like looking for water on Mars.</p>
<p>On Monday, the legislature passed Bill 205, the Third Party Amendment Act, put forward by Conservative MLA Rob Anderson. It will put a straitjacket on how much money third parties such as unions, corporations and other organizations can spend on political advertising during provincial elections. The government won't say so, but this is a way to prevent a repeat of the union-led attack ads against Stelmach we saw during the 2008 election campaign.</p>
<p>Those were the ads that criticized Stelmach for having no plan to fix education, health care or the economy. To drive home the point, the ads included a voice loudly whispering, "No pla-a-a-n." Not that the ads were particularly effective. If anything, they probably backfired, inadvertently allowing Stelmach to play the victim to big labour. But they were glitzy, well-produced, cost an estimated$2 million and were modelled after a successful campaign launched during the 2003 Ontario provincial election by a group calling itself "Working Families Coalition." Led by Ontario's building trades, that campaign helped the Liberals defeat the Conservatives.</p>
<p>The group behind the Alberta ads --Albertans for Change--included the Alberta Building Trades Council, the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees and the United Nurses of Alberta. They were hoping Albertans for Change could do for Alberta Liberals what the Working Families Coalition did for Ontario Liberals.</p>
<p>It wasn't to be. The Alberta Liberals lost ground in 2008.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Alberta government doesn't want big labour trying it again. So, Bill 205 will limit contributions to third-party advertising accounts. Donations to the accounts would be limited to $30,000 during an election year and $15,000 during a non-election year--the same limits as exist on contributions to political parties. The aim of the bill is to prevent any organization with deep pockets from attempting to sway public opinion via advertising during an election but the real target, based on the 2008 election, seems to be unions.</p>
<p>The NDP actually supported the bill because New Democrats don't like any third-party financing in campaigns.</p>
<p>And, as far as the NDP is concerned, it's also a little payback against the Albertans for Change ads which were designed to help the Liberals, not the NDP.</p>
<p>Alberta Liberals say the bill is an affront to free speech. MLA Harry Chase pointed out, with some justification, during Monday debate an inherent hypocrisy in the government's support of Bill 205: "The side of the bill I support is the notion of the accountability and transparency in terms of where the funding is coming from, who the donors are, and the size of the donation.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, this type of transparency and accountability is lacking from our own government in terms of how it conducts its own leadership races.</p>
<p>"The premier, for example, has yet to disclose where $163,000 came from in terms of support and the honourable minister of sustainable resources (Ted Morton) refuses to provide any information in terms of donors who supported his failed leadership bill.</p>
<p>"Therefore, the notion that this government is putting forward transparency and accountability is at best questionable."</p>
<p>It's an accusation that could also be levelled against Wildrose Alliance leader Danielle Smith who has refused to reveal the names of her leadership campaign donors.</p>
<p>But Smith doesn't have to listen to criticism on the floor of the legislature.</p>
<p>She is not an MLA and thus, unencumbered by any legislative burdens, is free to tour the province raising money and support for her fledgling party that, according to recent public opinion polls, is nipping at the heels of the Conservatives.</p>
<p>It's just another example of how some of the most interesting political events are happening outside the dome.</p>

<p>The Outaouais will have enough H1N1 flu vaccine for pregnant women, children and youths under 20, people with chronic health problems and health care workers until at least the end of the week.</p>
<p>Céline Jacob, a spokeswoman for the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de l'Outaouais, said vaccinations would continue daily in Gatineau and on different days in Papineau, Pontiac, Vallée de la Gatineau and des Collines.</p>
<p>Jacob said the public clinic in the recreation centre in Campbell's Bay would close for an unspecified time so health officials could vaccinate elementary and high school students.</p>
<p>Other Pontiac vaccination clinics that are closed for now include the Salle Paroissiale de Fort-Coulonge (525 rue Principale), the Salle Anglicane de Shawville (516 rue Principale), the Salle des lions de Quyon (1 rue Ferry) and a clinic at Salle Harrington on 64 chemin Pembroke in Chapeau.</p>
<p>Jacob said most Pontiac residents in vulnerable groups had been vaccinated.</p>
<p>The Pontiac's clinics are expected re-open when most people under 20 have been vaccinated.</p>

<p>Somewhere, I've got a plastic Champagne glass left over from the Millennium celebrations and a ticket stub for Céline Dion's New Year's Eve 1999 show in Montreal.</p>
<p>Didn't make the concert, and I drank only coffee on the big night. My colleagues and I were stuck in the newsroom, waiting for the Y2K Bug to wreak financial havoc. It didn't happen. We had to wait nine years for <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> to accomplish that.</p>
<p>So, for me, the new century started with a looming deadline and a big letdown. In literature, this is called foreshadowing -- a warning or indication of some future event. And, sure enough, the entire decade turned out to be a drag.</p>
<p>Now the end of "the Naughties" -- did anyone ever call it that? -- is in sight. I know time speeds up when you get older, but, boy, that didn't take long.</p>
<p>Looking back, it's pretty clear that the past 10 years should have been called the Dumb Decade. Pop culture got crass and ugly. There was nothing on network TV but idiotic reality shows, nothing worth listening to on the radio, and movies got steadily worse.</p>
<p>Politically, the Is-this-a-great-decade-or-what? moment arrived in November 2000. The Progressive Conservative Party was crushed in the federal election, winning 12 seats. I thought this would bring something interesting to the political landscape. But the Tories didn't stay in oblivion. The party gave itself a makeover, dropped a few pounds and went blonde. It took on a new name -- the Swinging Blue Jeans -- and instantly became more attractive to Quebec voters.</p>
<p>The decade's scariest rise to power? No question, it was the ascension of Simon Cowell, the judge on American Idol.</p>
<p>So far the biggest stories of the 21st century have been terrorism, technology and the stock-market meltdown. Each, in its own way, has not been that big a deal in historical terms. The tide of terrorist atrocities predicted in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001, never materialized in the West. There have been no further attacks on American soil since 9/11, assuming the recent rampage at Fort Hood was an act of madness, and not the work of a "sleeper" Islamic terrorist/psychiatrist. The bombings in London and Madrid turned out to be isolated horrors. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been bloody enough, but nothing on the scale of the Second World War slaughters.</p>
<p>The economic downtown of the past two years seems minor compared with the global depression of the 1930s. I was in London in late October, and Christmas decorations were already in place on Oxford Street. The sidewalks were heaving with shoppers, and the big department stores were so crowded that I had to give up and find a quiet pub. It didn't feel like a city battling a recession.</p>
<p>The decade saw a digital revolution of sorts, but it really wasn't all that breathtaking. Apple came up with some nifty gadgets, but mostly technology brought new ways to do things we already do. Watching TV on the Internet? It's OK, but nothing like as exciting or life-changing as the day your family finally got its first television set.</p>
<p>For me, the decade's most compelling news story was the tsunami that struck on Boxing Day 2004. It ranks as one of the deadliest natural disasters in history, having killed an estimated 200,000 people. It was a reminder that humans are still vulnerable to the terrifying vagaries of the weather.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, the 20th century began with a disaster. On April 26, 1900, a house fire in Hull became an inferno when strong winds brought flaming embers across the river to Ottawa's lumber yards. Headlines in the next day's Citizen read "Large portion of Ottawa destroyed" and "Hull to all intents wiped out."</p>
<p>Though more than 14,000 lost their homes, only seven people died in the fire. More people died of disease in the unsanitary tent cities where the homeless were forced to live afterwards.</p>
<p>If the past 10 years teaches us anything, it's how fortunate we are. We endured SARS and bird flu, and, although H1N1 is still in our midst, it seems to be peaking. We'll get through it, too.</p>
<p>The big news story of the new decade seems certain to be the waning of U.S. dominance and the emergence of China and India as the new superpowers, but that already seems so 1998.</p>
<p>Our times are more likely to be defined by how we finally woke up and began to preserve the environment. Or by our deadly failure to do so.</p>

<p>I arrived home from work last week to find a City of Ottawa green bin standing in front of my house. It was placed there ominously hiding in the shadows like something left over from Halloween. I was terrified to open it, afraid that an Ottawa city councillor would slither out and steal my wallet.</p>
<p>I limped over to it and dragged it, like a dead carcass, into the garage, where it will stay until next Halloween. I live alone and don't produce enough green waste to ever fill the thing up.</p>
<p>I'm limping because I'm recovering from a recent hernia operation. I thought then, while lying on the operating table and being sliced into by the surgeon: Oh no! Another entry for a city councillor to reach in and grab my wallet.</p>
<p>And, just as the anesthetic was taking effect, I remembered that the hospital had the foresight to warn me about leaving my wallet at home, and jewelry, too. Darn. It's bad enough that our hospitals have to worry about H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>So I donated my hernia with specific instructions to give it to an Ottawa city councillor. Any one will do.</p>

<p>The federal Liberals said Monday it could be 2010 by the time all Canadians who want the H1N1 vaccine can get it. Liberal health critic Carolyn Bennett suggested Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq had misled Canadians in telling them the timeline for the vaccination campaign. Aglukkaq has said that the government's goal is to have the program complete by Christmas, but last week in a news briefing she also said the vaccination campaign was estimated to take eight to 12 weeks. Most clinics began operating on Oct. 26; if that it is used as the starting date, eight weeks is mid-December, but 12 is well into January.</p>

<p>With more than half of Toronto Public Health's staff deployed to work related to the H1N1 influenza pandemic, regular programs have been suspended, including some sexual health clinics, home visits for new mothers and some food safety inspections.</p>
<p>"There are many important public health programs that are either not being offered or being offered in a reduced level of service," Dr. David McKeown told a board of health meeting on Monday, noting the impact has been greatest on nurses who have been redeployed to work in 10 public vaccination clinics.</p>
<p>Even though some temporary agency nurses have been hired, the impact remains. Public Health has tried to maintain some key priority programs, including those for pregnant teens, homeless women and new mothers at risk of postpartum depression.</p>

<p>Ultimate Fighting heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar's fight career could be in jeopardy due to an intestinal illness that will require surgery, according to mixed martial arts impresario Dana White.</p>
<p>UFC president White told the TMZ website on Monday that Lesnar was "very, very sick" with an intestinal disorder that will require surgery, and that he will try to get the beefy 32-year-old admitted to Minnesota's <span class="companylink">Mayo Clinic</span>. White said Lesnar, who was diagnosed with mononucleosis earlier this month, collapsed a week ago at his Canadian vacation property and has since been hospitalized.</p>
<p>"There's a possibility Lesnar will never fight again," White told TMZ. Lesnar, who is 6-foot-3 and 265 pounds and has an outsized personality to match, has not been heard from for three weeks. He was to defend his heavyweight belt in January against Shane Carwin, but that bout, already rescheduled once before amid rumours that Lesnar had contracted the H1N1 virus, has again been put off.</p>
<p>"He's got mono and he's got something else wrong with him," White said Saturday after UFC 105 in Manchester, England. "I know what's wrong with him, he just doesn't want me talking about it. He doesn't have cancer or AIDS or anything like this, (but) he's got some problems, man.</p>
<p>"He went up to Canada just to get away from his house, to go up there and just kind of chill out up there. He dropped. He went down, and he had to go to hospital. They ran every test on the planet on him and they ended up finding something else was wrong with him."</p>
<p>Calls to Lesnar's agents and an email message to White for further comment were not returned.</p>
<p>Lesnar, a South Dakota native who went to the University of Minnesota and won the 2000 NCAA wrestling championship, has gone through a number of career turns, including professional wrestling and a failed try at the NFL with the Minnesota Vikings. At 30 he joined the UFC and won the heavyweight title a year ago, beating Randy Couture. Lesnar has won four of five bouts and become a major UFC gate attraction in the process.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pork farmers' troubles ease; China is the only major market banning import of Canadian hogs and meat over swine flu fears</b>
</div><div>Joanna Smith   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Hog producers are starting to relax now that China is the only significant market barring Canadian pork exports due to H1N1, but the federal government once feared dozens of other countries would do the same.</p>
<p>The latest information from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency shows 11 countries still have some restrictions on imports of hogs and their meat in the wake of the swine flu outbreak earlier this year, a move producers say has hurt an already troubled industry that was on the verge of recovery before the pandemic took its toll.</p>
<p>"It could have been worse if other countries had really gone after trying to stop exports," Jacques Pomerleau, executive director of Canadian Pork International, said in a recent interview, adding that international authorities such as the World Health Organization helped defuse the situation by stressing that H1N1 is not a food-safety issue.</p>
<p>The horizon looked much worse at the beginning of the outbreak. According to documents created to brief Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz on the H1N1 influenza virus in May, federal officials were monitoring at least 50 countries they believed would impose trade barriers on Canadian exports of live swine, pork and pork products, or had already done so.</p>
<p>The briefing package contains three documents listing countries around the world and notes on details of measures those foreign nations took, or the Canadian government feared they would take, as a result of the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>The first list, created May 5, has notes written beside 33 foreign markets, including the United States, Japan, Russia, South Korea and Hong Kong, that together represent more than $3 billion in exports of Canadian live swine, pork and pork products in 2008.</p>
<p>The second list, created May 6, includes notes beside another 16 countries, including the Netherlands, Lithuania, the United Kingdom, Germany and Romania, representing an additional total of $4.6 million in exports of those commodities last year. Switzerland was added to the third list created May 7, but that country did not import any of those products from Canada last year anyway.</p>
<p>The Star obtained the documents through the Access to Information Act. Details on trade actions were blanked out under an exemption to the act that allows the government to censor information obtained in confidence from foreign states.</p>
<p>Many of the countries the government was monitoring, such as Japan and the European Union, never took any action against Canadian exports and others have since lifted their H1N1-related restrictions.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The Liberals are urging the federal government to translate H1N1 pamphlets into dozens of languages, but local public health officials say Ontario is already reaching out to linguistic minorities.</p>
<p>"Across the country, we are hearing again and again (about) the lack of information in languages that Canadians can understand, in the 60, 70, languages that need to be there (and) that it is folly to just hand a press release or an information package out to ethnic media, expect them to do the translation," Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett told a news conference Monday.</p>
<p>Bennett (St. Paul's) called on the federal government to take on the role of translating the material so that local public health units can concentrate on administering the H1N1 vaccine at flu clinics across the country.</p>
<p>"It's the right thing to do," Bennett said, adding that it would also avoid a duplication of efforts and ensure accuracy of the translated messages. She could not provide any specific examples of these problems.</p>
<p>Ontario health ministry spokesman David Jensen said the province has not received calls for help from public health units.</p>
<p>Jensen added Ontario is taking numerous steps, including advertising in 94 ethnic newspapers, running radio spots in 19 languages and making pamphlets available in 28 languages on the ministry website.</p>
<p>Toronto Public Health offers information about the H1N1 virus in English and 18 other languages.</p>
<p>In an interview Monday, Dr. David Butler-Jones, the country's chief public health officer, said about 20 per cent of Canadians have received the H1N1 shot, the highest percentage of vaccination in the world.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Facebook's ‘unfriend' defines 2009</b>
</div><div>JOSH WINGROVE    </div>

</p>
<p>Dipping its toe into the world of social networking, the venerable Oxford University Press has chosen “unfriend” as its 2009 Word of the Year.</p>
<p>A verb, to unfriend is “to remove someone as a ‘friend' on a social networking site such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>,” the Oxford English Dictionary publisher said in an announcement yesterday.</p>
<p>“It has both currency and potential longevity,” Christine Lindberg, senior lexicographer of Oxford's American dictionary program, wrote on the publisher's blog.</p>
<p>A favourite among the social networking crowd, unfriend is hardly new – its definitions in the online user-generated Urban Dictionary date back to 2004. However, Ms. Lindberg said it is rare that a verb includes the prefix “un,” typically used in an adjective.</p>
<p>“Unfriend has real lex-appeal,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Announcing a word of the year is a popular exercise. Merriam-Webster, a rival dictionary publisher, typically announces its own in December. The American Dialect Society will make its choice at a Baltimore conference in early January. (Last year, both those groups chose the same word: Bailout).</p>
<p>The crowning of unfriend was not met with universal praise.</p>
<p>“Oh dear,” said veteran lexicographer David Barnhart, past president of the Dictionary Society of North America, when told of the selection. He doesn't expect unfriend to stand the test of time.</p>
<p>“Often what these groups, societies and individuals light upon is something that has what I like to call linguistic sex appeal. … Very often they get tripped up by cute words that don't seem to have very much life.”</p>
<p>Mr. Barnhart has kept a running list of his own 2009 Word of the Year candidates, to present when he attends the ADS meeting. It includes H1N1 or swine flu, death panel, shovel-ready, and vook (a video book).</p>
<p>“I really don't know what the word is going to be. I don't think it's going to be ‘unfriend.' That really doesn't strike me as wonderful.”</p>
<p>Unfriend beat out 18 other OUP finalists, including death panel, a theoretical body invoked in opposition to American health-care reform; funemployed, or enjoying one's unemployment; hashtag, a keyword used to sort themed topics on websites such as Twitter; and teabagger, a person who has opposed the American stimulus package through community protests akin to the Boston Tea Party.</p>
<p>Oxford's past words of the year include hypermiling, the attempt to maximize gas mileage by making adjustments to a vehicle or driving habits, in 2008; locavore, a consumer of locally grown foods, in 2007; carbon neutral, the reduction and offset of harmful carbon emissions, in 2006; and podcast, a downloadable audio file, in 2005.</p>

<p>In Assessing pandemic price tag (Nov. 14,), your lead editorial takes the supportable position that high costs attributable to H1N1 are justified. What it fails to do is question the apparently dramatic change in costs of the vaccine now being reported. A basic contract is quite simple: The purchaser orders a specified number of doses at an agreed price. The supplier contracts to provide them at that price and by a certain date. Now we are being told that the cost has escalated dramatically. One news story suggested it has doubled. The editorial points out a doubling in costs of masks, gowns, etc., as well.</p>
<p>How can this be? We know that government departments have not been known for their negotiating skills. And I know from personal experience that Big Pharma doesn't sign unprofitable contracts. The original contract will have been extremely profitable. So are we to assume that government has agreed to pay more than the original contract requires? This would verge on dereliction of duty, stupidity being a possible aggravating factor. Once the dust has settled, we should be demanding a thorough investigation into how the federal government negotiates contracts and what kind of oversight process exists.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pharmacists remixing adult doses so kids can receive Tamiflu</b>
</div><div>CAROLINE ALPHONSO   </div>
<div>649 words</div><div>17 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>A worldwide shortage of children's Tamiflu to treat H1N1 infections has the federal government dipping into its national emergency stockpile and pharmacists preparing doses the old-fashioned way – with a mortar and pestle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Canadian spokeswoman for Hoffman-La Roche, the Swiss maker of the antiviral drug, said the order for more of the children's liquid doses won't be ready for another month or so – likely after the pandemic virus has passed its peak.</p>
<p>“We're actively working to bring more product into the country,” Laura Pagnotta said yesterday. “We can't provide a specific date but we are definitely in the queue. And we do anticipate having additional [supplies] available in the next month or so.”</p>
<p>The second wave of the H1N1 virus has not only led to more hospitalizations and additional deaths, it has resulted in more Canadians walking into pharmacies with prescriptions for antiviral medication. In the last week of October, more than 28,000 prescriptions were written for Tamiflu, the highest number since the virus first appeared in April, according to data from the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>Oseltamivir – Tamiflu's generic name – can keep the virus in check if taken within days of symptoms appearing. Zanamivir, which is sold under the brand name Relenza, is another antiviral, but it is not approved for children under age 7.</p>
<p>The federal government dispensed 17,000 doses of pediatric Tamiflu in September from its emergency stockpile. (The government was unable to provide data on its current pediatric stockpile by deadline yesterday.) But pharmacists say the sheer volume of prescriptions, along with a shortage of the children's oral suspension, has them manually mixing doses.</p>
<p>Donnie Edwards, former chair of the Ontario Pharmacists' Association and a community pharmacist in Ridgeway, Ont., said about a week ago he was filling out, on average, four to eight children's Tamiflu prescriptions a day. To make the dosage, he empties the adult capsule, grinds the powder with a mortar and pestle, measures the correct amount and adds liquids and sweeteners.</p>
<p>“The whole time that all of this has been happening in the news, pharmacists have been out there scrambling and making sure that they are playing the critical-care role … to make sure children are being treated properly,” Mr. Edwards said.</p>
<p>Ms. Pagnotta of Roche said the company prioritized the manufacture of adult capsules, because they are used to treat seasonal flu, which affects primarily the elderly. The adult capsule can also be produced 25 times faster than the children's liquid Tamiflu and it can be repurposed for pediatric patients.</p>
<p>“By having those 75-milligram capsules, we're better able to meet the needs of a broader base of patients,” she said. Roche produces 30- and 45-milligram capsules for children, but the liquid version is preferred for young children who cannot swallow tablets.</p>
<p>One health expert said the shortage of liquid Tamiflu during the pandemic will serve as a lesson when preparing for the next one.</p>
<p>Upton Allen, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Hospital for Sick Children, said that while his hospital has been actively compounding the correct dosage for children, more preparation in guaranteeing adequate supplies and further studies will be needed in the years ahead.</p>
<p>“Prior to the 2009 pandemic, we didn't have a lot of data that told us the correct doses of Tamiflu that we ought to use in very young children, particularly infants under one year of age,” Dr. Allen said.</p>
<p>“So there are two issues. First is the need to ensure that supplies are there as we move forward in time. And second, to ensure that the supplies are accompanied by the appropriate research that tells us what is the best dose to use to treat different individuals.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu battle cuts into other public-health services; Across the country, programs ranging from prenatal classes to food-safety inspections suffer as staff are redeployed</b>

<p>TORONTO and MONTREAL -- Peggy Verhoef's children were devastated earlier this month to learn their suicide support group had been put on hold. The social workers who lead the group near Montreal were reassigned to work as greeters at H1N1 vaccination centres.</p>
<p>Ms. Verhoef's children, aged 13 and 15, who attend because their father committed suicide last year, were “extremely upset,” she said yesterday.</p>
<p>“The bureaucrats didn't stop to think about how it would affect the kids.”</p>
<p>Across the country, public health programs ranging from support groups to sexual-health clinics to food-safety inspections are being postponed or suspended as officials redirect nurses and other staff to vaccinating Canadians against the H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Although the chaos that marked the first two weeks of the limited vaccine rollout has subsided, and the pandemic's second wave appears to have peaked, dozens of such programs remain in limbo because staff is still being diverted.</p>
<p>Ms. Verhoef spoke out against the government's move and, last week, received notice that the suspension would be reversed.</p>
<p>Several provinces – Quebec, New Brunswick and British Columbia among them – have postponed other school vaccinations, travel clinics and rollouts of the human papillomavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, health authorities in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Ontario have suspended prenatal classes to make room for vaccination clinics.</p>
<p>Gerry Predy, Alberta's Senior Medical Officer of Health, said the province's staffing challenge has been aggravated by absenteeism as some health-care workers fall ill themselves.</p>
<p>Health authorities such as Vancouver Coastal Health that have managed to avoid cutting services have done so by recruiting fresh blood in the form of nursing students, or putting calls out to retired nurses.</p>
<p>So many beds and staff resources are being devoted to people with H1N1 that Nova Scotia's largest health authority has sharply reduced the number of surgeries it can perform. Outpatient services in some B.C. hospitals have been closed to divert doctors to emergency room treatment.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Toronto's public-health workers, ranging from registered nurses to clerks and health inspectors, have been retrained and redeployed – many of them to staff the 10 clinics that have so far doled out 80,000 doses of vaccine.</p>
<p>That redeployment has closed sexual-health clinics and strained or suspended family-health programs. The city's food-safety inspectors are postponing routine inspections for low-risk sites and prioritizing medium-risk inspections.</p>
<p>“It is a significant concern. … People who need those services are not getting them, or are getting them at a reduced level,” said David McKeown, Toronto's Medical Officer of Health. “We've tried to scale back services in a way that protects the most vulnerable, but there are impacts.”</p>
<p>The city has also hired contract nurses to beef up staffing at H1N1 vaccine clinics. That has helped to some extent, Dr. McKeown said, but it hasn't alleviated the need to take more than half of the public health department's staff out of their normal jobs.</p>
<p>Susan Makin, director of the city's healthy families services, said as the pandemic response ramps up, increasingly critical programs take a hit. She said it's possible more services will be suspended or curtailed in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“It's still a gradual scale-back. We're not down to the very lowest we can go yet.”</p>

<p>Like everywhere else, fixing things takes time here, but change slows down to a glacial rate in the world of Canadian television. Nobody wants to change the channel.</p>
<p>Momentous change is transpiring in our national TV landscape right now, but the typical Canadian is probably more concerned about the H1N1 vaccination, or getting the snow tires put on the car. Swine flu and winter snow are realities; TV is merely cheap home entertainment.</p>
<p>But TV is changing, so we're told. In case you skipped past the headlines, our broadcast industry is in the fight of its life, or something like that, as Canada's big networks square off against the country's largest cable and satellite carriers over the broadcasters' proposal to charge the cable operators fees for their signals. No doubt you've noticed those apocalyptic TV ads from the cable folks wedged in between broadcasts of your favourite American shows.</p>
<p>The divisive showdown, currently taking place in a hearing room in Gatineau, Que., is being very closely watched by the dozen or so people who cover such stories. As often happens, the battle between lawyers, policy wonks and the other usual suspects is expected to rage on for weeks and months – years? – before any resolution affecting the average taxpayer is reached. For the time being, perhaps best to focus on what's right about Canadian television.</p>
<p>Tonight brings two homegrown programs currently at the top of their games. You're probably already watching one, and barely aware of the other.</p>
<p>In the former category, The Rick Mercer Report (CBC, 8 p.m.) is having one of its best seasons to date, both in ratings and industry acclaim.</p>
<p>Only last weekend, The Rick Mercer Report took best-comedy honours at the Gemini Awards. The pride of St. John's, Mercer was typically humble in accepting his trophy, because that's the appropriate response at a Canadian awards show, and because he was well-raised.</p>
<p>This current campaign is Mercer's seventh season since graduating from the class of This Hour Has 22 Minutes – also still doing nicely, by the way – and his show appears to be on a steady upward ratings curve of late.</p>
<p>So far this season, Mercer Report has repeatedly edged past the million-plus viewer plateau – no small feat for any show on Canadian television – and has peaked at 1.3-million for a late September broadcast. On some nights, Rick Mercer's audience nearly doubles that of CBC's fancified new version of The National – and what does that tell us about Canadian viewing patterns?</p>
<p>In rough terms, more people are watching Mercer these days because the curly-haired provocateur is saying and doing things no one else is saying or doing on Canadian television. Mercer is now fully grown into his role as Canada's resident satirist-laureate. Merging his rowdyman spirit with everyman appeal, he's become our national TV tour guide, with an edge. Mercer is equal parts Wayne Rostad and Stephen Leacock.</p>
<p>Consider tonight's show, in which Mercer goes to London, Ont., to train with Canada's national wheelchair rugby team while it takes part in an international tournament with teams from all over the world. Alternately known as murderball, the sport is a Canadian invention, don't you know, and is played by quadriplegic athletes of either gender. As he does, Mercer gets into a wheelchair and gets into the act, and is promptly humbled.</p>
<p>In the same show, Mercer hits Toronto's Royal Agricultural Winter Fair to hang out with a pack of impressive mutts known as SuperDogs, most of which are rescue dogs capable of remarkable feats. In the process, Rick manages to bond with a bulldog named Pot Roast.</p>
<p>The other homemade Tuesday show deserves a little more love. Being Erica (CBC, 9 p.m.) is a sophomore drama trying to stay afloat on Tuesday night against competition from such heady U.S. network fare as NCIS: Los Angeles and The Biggest Loser.</p>
<p>On most weeks, Being Erica is lucky to crack the half-million viewer mark. At the same time, plucky Albertan Erin Karpluk, who plays Erica, collected the trophy for best dramatic actress at the Gemini Awards. In Canadian TV circles, that almost makes sense.</p>
<p>But make some effort to sample Being Erica, because the sequel season is much</p>
<p>improved and Karpluk remains a unique character study as</p>
<p>the young woman whose shrink/counsellor Dr. Tom, played by Michael Riley, has the ability to send Erica back</p>
<p>in time to address her major life regrets.</p>
<p>In tonight's outing, Erica's publishing career appears on the upswing with the sex book, though she's dismayed when hunky barista Kai (Sebastian Pigott) turns out to be one of the case-study volunteers. More intriguing is the storyline wherein Erica time-shifts back to her late teens to relive some unpleasantness involving her late brother Leo and the use of the family car.</p>
<p>Is Being Erica a glossy exercise in wish fulfilment, or simply too Canadian for Canadian viewers? Yes on both counts, really, but it is never boring.</p>

<p>John Doyle returns on Saturday.</p>

<p>Also airing</p>
<p>Frontline: A Death in</p>
<p>Tehran (PBS, 9 p.m.) revisits last summer's Iranian presidential election and focuses on a solitary tragedy amid the chaos, when young protester Neda Soltan was shot and killed on the streets of the city. Her death was filmed on a camera phone and the shocking moment went out to the world via the Internet. The Frontline crew talks to eyewitnesses and identifies Soltan's killer – a member of the Basij militia brought in to stamp out the protesters' spirits. More touchingly, they interview Soltan's mother, who last month was offered financial assistance from the government if she would publicly blame her daughter's death on its opponents. She refused.</p>
<p>The Good Wife (CBS, Global, 10 p.m.) holds steady as one of this season's best new dramas, riding entirely on the strength of Julianna Margulies's portrayal of a formidable solicitor and wronged woman. Tonight, her character of Alicia Florrick is busily preparing to defend a scientist accused of arson when the lawyer for her soon-to-be ex-husband, Peter (Chris Noth) – a former state attorney caught in a sex and corruption scandal – requests that she supply upbeat testimony at his appeal. The old song Stand By Your Man is not in the soundtrack. A.R.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>UBC elite swimmers get flu vaccine; Doctor says five athletes received leftover doses, not special treatment</b>
</div><div>Kent Spencer   </div>

</p>
<p>Elite swimmers in good health have received the H1N1 flu vaccine, weeks before it will be available to the general public.</p>
<p>The five healthy individuals were given the shot as part of a UBC-based inoculation to protect asthmatic swimmers, who are approved for the vaccine.</p>
<p>Dr. Janet McKeown said Monday the doses would have been wasted if they had not been given out, because an open batch of vaccine will spoil within 24 hours.</p>
<p>"If those athletes didn't get it, it would be in the garbage. It's better in an arm," said McKeown, who has about 50 patients who train with the national and University of B.C. swim teams.</p>
<p>The doses were left over from a batch of 20 that was opened to treat 15 asthmatic swimmers.</p>
<p>Kim Kerr, executive director of the Downtown Eastside Residents Association, said a better use might have been found for the shots.</p>
<p>"I hope people in her position would give it to people who need it more urgently," said Kerr.</p>
<p>"Did she make some effort to find people with health issues? Given the sensitivity of the issue, you would think she would be more cautious," he said.</p>
<p>McKeown said the extra vaccines were not needed at the UBC Clinic at the time the vaccines were given in late October.</p>
<p>"I don't feel that anyone was given special treatment, whether they were athletes, university faculty or others," she said.</p>
<p>Several sports teams have already received their vaccines, including Abbotsford Heat and Chilliwack Bruins hockey players.</p>
<p>In Alberta, two health officials were fired after the NHL's Calgary Flames received the vaccine.</p>
<p>The early shots have prompted accusations of special treatment.</p>
<p>B.C.'s top health officer, Dr. Perry Kendall, has sent a letter to all B.C. sports organizations, reminding them not to seek preferential treatment to access the vaccine.</p>
<p>Dr. Patricia Daly, chief medical officer at Vancouver Coastal Health, said doctors have been advised to give extra doses to "other patients coming in." "We wanted doctors to target high-risk groups," she said.</p>
<p>Daly would not comment on the swimmers' circumstances, but noted none of the queue- jumping hockey teams is from Vancouver.</p>
<p>Kendall, meanwhile, said the virus appears to have peaked because visits to emergency clinics and hospitals are declining.</p>
<p>It will take about three weeks to vaccinate young people aged five to 19 years and those over 65, who became eligible for shots beginning Monday.</p>
<p>About one million H1N1 doses have been distributed in B.C.</p>
<p>Kendall estimated the vaccine will be available to the general public in about three weeks' time.</p>
<p>Across Canada, 161 people have died of H1N1. In B.C., 23 people have died.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Aglukkaq attacked on H1N1</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>624 words</div><div>17 November 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>The federal government was criticized Monday for the rollout of the H1N1 vaccine by the Liberals, who said it could be 2010 by the time all Canadians who want the shot can get it.</p>
<p>After a week-long break from the House of Commons, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq returned to Parliament Hill to face a renewed attack from the Liberals on how the Conservative government has handled the country's largest mass vaccination program.</p>
<p>Liberal health critic Carolyn Bennett led off question period by suggesting Aglukkaq has misled Canadians in telling them the timeline for the vaccination campaign. Aglukkaq has said in the House of Commons and in news conferences that the government's goal is to have the program complete by Christmas, but last week in a news briefing she also said the vaccination campaign is estimated to take eight to 12 weeks. Most clinics began operating on Oct. 26 and, if that is used as the starting date, eight weeks from then is mid-December, but 12 is well into January.</p>
<p>"We have said all along that we would try and complete the vaccination program by December. In fact, we were early in the rollout of our campaign across the country," Aglukkaq said in response to Bennett's accusation. "I want to acknowledge all the hard work of the front-line people, who are doing a fantastic job in getting the immunizations out to Canadians. By the end of this week, we will have over 10.4 million vaccines in provinces and territories."</p>
<p>The government has ordered 50.4 million doses of vaccine from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>. Doses are being shipped to the provinces and territories every week, as they come off the production line, and local health units are responsible for administering the vaccination programs.</p>
<p>The opposition parties have been blasting the government for weeks over the vaccine rollout and its timeline and other aspects of the pandemic response.</p>
<p>They are also calling on the federal government to provide more funds to help local public-health units hire more staff to deliver the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq answered that call Monday by saying this year's federal budget gave the provinces and territories $24 billion to provide health care and that the government invested $1 billion to develop the national pandemic plan.</p>
<p>The health minister also rebuffed a call for the federal government to fund the translation of H1N1-related materials into languages other than French and English. At a news conference earlier in the day, and in question period, Bennett said local health units have been spending their "very scarce" resources on translating messages for ethnic communities.</p>
<p>"It is the job of the federal government to co-ordinate this and to make sure that there isn't any Canadian that does not understand the importance of the vaccine, the priority lists," said Bennett. "This is seriously a call for leadership from this federal government in understanding the makeup of this country."</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada's website on the H1N1 pandemic includes information in French, English, Inuktitut and a few other aboriginal languages, and Aglukkaq said the provinces and territories, and their local health units, are communicating well with the people they serve.</p>
<p>"If you did your research, you will see the provinces and territories are doing a great job in getting the message out," said Aglukkaq, who cited Ontario as an example. The province has materials translated into about 19 languages.</p>
<p>According to the 2006 census, 98 per cent of Canada's population can speak one or both official languages.</p>

</div><div>Murray Mandryk   </div>
<div>Regina Leader-Post</div>
<div>673 words</div><div>17 November 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>For a group supposedly mortified by the former NDP government picking winners and losers, the Saskatchewan Party in Opposition was always rather quiet when it came to taxpayers' money being poured into <span class="companylink">Big Sky Farms Inc</span>., which provided jobs in its MLAs' ridings.</p>
<p>But now that Big Sky is under creditor protection and the Saskatchewan Party is running the government that owns 64 per cent of the company, the party is being even quieter on how it intends to help the farmers who are getting stiffed on payments for the feed grain they've delivered to the company's barns.</p>
<p>For a party that touts itself as being all about supporting the little guy and not getting into bed with corporate interests, the NDP always seemed rather eager to throw the considerable weight of government and the province's Crown sector behind investing in the corporate hog sector.</p>
<p>But now that Big Sky is under creditor protection, leaving a lot of little guys such as the farmers plus welders, plumbers and others holding the bag, we're hearing remarkably little from the Opposition NDP about the company its government once touted as a great investment for rural Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>This essentially is the big problem with the government making investments in such ventures.</p>
<p>Rather than scramble to protect the interests of Saskatchewan people who are being hurt by the company's creditor protection status, politicians from both parties are hurrying to protect their own interests and the stances they've adopted in the past.</p>
<p>The issue today shouldn't be another tiresome debate over whether the former NDP government was wrong to back a company that happened to supply 400 jobs to rural Saskatchewan (which is one reason why Saskatchewan Party MLAs weren't very vocal then in criticizing the government's Big Sky investments.)</p>
<p>To now second-guess Big Sky's business decisions isn't any more productive than for the company to try to blame its problems on the media for calling H1N1 the "swine flu" and affecting pork prices worldwide.</p>
<p>Big Sky was founded by Florian Possberg, who last February moved from his job as the company's president and CEO to take a position as deputy chair charged with pursuing growth opportunities. The company's problems pretty much reflect the realities of the hog industry, which has been hammered by high feed costs, America's country-of-origin labeling laws and decreasing pork consumption.</p>
<p>Unlike other large Canadian hog producers, Big Sky might have been slow to reduce its inventory of production sows last winter, likely hoping to ride out the poor pork prices that were in effect long before the swine flu hit. That said, other private hog producers have gone into receivership too, leaving creditors scrambling.</p>
<p>One major difference, however, is that Big Sky is nearly two-thirds owned by the provincial government. It's untenable that cheques issued by the company before Nov. 10 will not be honoured by the banks. It's especially unacceptable when Big Sky still requires grain to feed its hogs and has even said it will pay a premium.</p>
<p>For Agriculture Minister Bob Bjornerud to tell reporters Monday that his government has no obligation to ensure the farmers are paid for the grain they've delivered to Big Sky is startling.</p>
<p>Rightly, farmers see the situation quite differently.</p>
<p>Rob Carlson, a Preeceville-area farmer who isn't being paid the $47,000 he's owed for the nine semi-trailers of feed barley he trucked to Big Sky, told CBC that he isn't buying the government's argument.</p>
<p>But as disconcerting was the NDP's reluctance to raise such a made-to-order issue in the house on Monday, possibly out of concern over how this issue reflects on its government's investment in Big Sky.</p>
<p>Sometimes, politicians need to step back, stop their partisan posturing and do what's right. That, after all, is why we elect them.</p>

<p>The Saskatoon Health Region's flu assessment centre at St. Paul's Hospital will remain open this week after a successful weekend test, health officials say.</p>
<p>About 25 people were screened for H1N1 influenza on Saturday and Sunday at the assessment centre, which remains open until Friday.</p>
<p>"It's really made a difference in the emergency department to get (that many people) out," said Leanne Smith, the health region's ambulatory care director. "The volumes in the emergency department were less on the weekend than we saw on past weekends."</p>
<p>Emergency department visits at Saskatoon's three hospitals hit an average of 400 per day this month, up from 300 per day last November. The health region attributes the increase to people seeking treatment for H1N1 flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>As of Sunday, there are 26 confirmed H1N1 cases in the health region and eight of those people are in intensive-care units. Six of the eight in ICU are on ventilators.</p>
<p>The health region asks that people with mild flu-like symptoms visit the assessment centre, a family doctor or walk-in clinic instead of emergency departments.</p>
<p>The assessment centre is open daily from 4:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. and is located to the left of the entrance at St. Paul's. People are assessed and treated on average within 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Only St. Paul's will operate the independent screening and people arriving at Royal University or City hospitals are asked if they could instead visit the west-side hospital.</p>
<p>"At this point in time, it's voluntary," said Smith. "The two other sites were considered but the community surrounding St. Paul's has issues like access to transportation."</p>
<p>The assessment centres are operated like a doctor's office, said Smith. People arrive and are treated by nurses, who check vitals, swab samples and give anti-viral medication, depending on the person.</p>
<p>"If they're screened as a severe illness, they're moved to the emergency department," said Smith, adding to date, one person has been transferred.</p>
<p>Health officials will monitor the number of visits to the assessment centre this week to determine if it should remain open or be moved to another location.</p>
<p>Severe flu-like symptoms include difficulty breathing, sudden dizziness, chest pain and severe or persistent vomiting or diarrhea. Children with symptoms such as fast breathing, grey skin colour, blue lips, dehydration and listlessness should visit the RUH emergency department.</p>
<p>People with mild symptoms are asked to remain at home to rest and drink plenty of water.</p>
<p>Cancer patients</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Saskatchewan Cancer Agency says cancer patients receiving treatment can get the H1N1 flu shot at the Saskatoon Cancer Centre or the Allan Blair Cancer Centre in Regina.</p>
<p>The agency will vaccinate those receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy, as well as leukemia and lymphoma patients and pre-stem cell transplant patients.</p>
<p>The flu shot should be given 48 hours before or after treatment, but should not be taken if patients are allergic to anything in the vaccine or have a platelet count below 20,000, according to the agency.</p>
<p>Students up next</p>
<p>Vaccinations should be made available on Wednesday to students in Grade 7 to</p>
<p>Grade 12 within the health region. A schedule for the vaccinations was not available Monday but the plan should be released by the health region today.</p>
<p>The four school divisions within the health region are Saskatoon Public, Greater Saskatoon Catholic, Horizon and Prairie Spirit. About 10,000 students in the target group attend about 100 schools within the health region.</p>

</div><div>Jason Warick   </div>
<div>The StarPhoenix; with Canwest News files</div>
<div>670 words</div><div>17 November 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>

<p>A Saskatoon-born academic who became one of Canada's top chemists has died at age 38 after apparently contracting the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Keith Fagnou died last Wednesday in the intensive-care unit at the Ottawa Hospital, three days after he was admitted. The married father of three had no known underlying medical conditions, according to Ottawa Public Health.</p>
<p>This year, Fagnou became the first Canadian to win the OMCOS award in organometallic chemistry. The award is presented every two years to a scientist under 40 in recognition of outstanding research contributions.</p>
<p>"I was in shock when I heard. It hit us like a sledgehammer. My wife and I were in tears," said friend Sean Robson.</p>
<p>Fagnou, a graduate of Holy Cross High School and the University of Saskatchewan, was married to Dr. Danielle Gervais-Fagnou, a family doctor with the University of Ottawa's health services clinic.</p>
<p>Fagnou was a competitive long-distance runner and canoeist. After graduating from the U of S, he taught briefly in the mid-1990s at Ecole Canadienne-Francaise and St. Joseph High School.</p>
<p>Sheila Chad, who was vice-principal at St. Joseph at the time, said she and other teachers remember him as a "really nice guy, a great staff member. We were all pretty shocked."</p>
<p>Fagnou was also a longtime naval reserve officer. He met Robson during his time training off the coast of Vancouver Island. The two Saskatoon natives became close friends. Robson was Fagnou's instructor, and recalls Fagnou's incredible ability to learn the complexities of commanding a vessel at sea.</p>
<p>"He was a real gifted student. He had a real knack for it," said Robson, now a paleontologist.</p>
<p>Fagnou's former PhD supervisor said the death would change the way people look at the threat of H1N1.</p>
<p>"Everybody thinks it will happen to someone else, somebody who has some kind of additional illness," said Mark Lautens, a professor from the University of Toronto, where Fagnou did his doctorate.</p>
<p>"Keith was a seemingly healthy person who got very sick, very fast. As soon as I heard the news I felt sick to my stomach, and then I thought, this is going to change the way we look at this kind of disease," Lautens said.</p>
<p>Lautens said the death of his former student has shaken the scientific community.</p>
<p>"I've had e-mails from China, Harvard, all over the U.S., France."</p>
<p>The University of Ottawa released a statement mourning the loss of the gifted researcher and professor, who was the University Research Chair in novel catalytic transformations.</p>
<p>His research group focused on improving the preparation of complex molecules for</p>
<p>petrochemical, pharmaceutical or industrial uses. The program is part of the "green chemistry" movement aimed at searching for more efficient chemical processes to help the environment.</p>
<p>Fagnou joined the University of Ottawa's faculty of science in 2002 and won several prestigious awards, including the Polyani Prize in 2003, the Governor General's Gold Medal and the Premier's Research Excellence Award.</p>
<p>Lautens recalled how Fagnou came to him as a young teacher from Saskatchewan who realized he had a passion for chemistry. He moved to Toronto to take advanced-level chemistry courses.</p>
<p>"He was the most prolific student who has ever worked with me in 25 years." He and Fagnou published as many as 10 papers together.</p>
<p>Lautens recalled how Fagnou would hold "ABBA Fridays" in his lab and play music by the Swedish rock band all day long.</p>
<p>"He had that quintessential Canadian modesty, despite his great success. His trajectory of scientific success is second to none in Canada. He was winning all the top awards, getting all the best students, getting invitations to present all over."</p>
<p>Lautens recalled, though, how his former student had his priorities right. He turned down one recent request to speak because he didn't want to miss trick-or-treating with his children.</p>

</p>
<p>The word came from the feds last week. New arrivals in Canada will no longer be given the idea that Canada is a warm, gentle place where they can do pretty much whatever they like.</p>
<p>Being a Canadian means, it turns out, acknowledging that there are responsibilities that go with our Charter-given rights.</p>
<p>The new Discover Canada booklet, to be given to immigrants, describes some of those responsibilities. It includes pretty tough talk.</p>
<p>- Obey the law. "Individuals and governments are regulated by laws and not by arbitrary actions. No person or group is above the law."</p>
<p>- Get a job. "Taking care of one's family and working hard in keeping with one's abilities are important Canadian values. Work contributes to personal dignity and self-respect, and to Canada's prosperity."</p>
<p>- Serve on a jury, if asked. "You are legally required to serve. Serving on a jury is a privilege that makes the justice system work, as it depends on impartial juries made up of citizens."</p>
<p>- Get out and vote. "The right to vote comes with a responsibility to vote."</p>
<p>- Help others. "Millions of volunteers freely donate their time to help others without pay -- helping people in need, assisting at your child's school, volunteering at a food bank or other charity, or encouraging newcomers to integrate."</p>
<p>- Protect and enjoy our heritage and environment. "Avoid waste and pollution while protecting Canada's natural, cultural and architectural heritage for future generations."</p>
<p>The booklet includes comprehensive lessons on Canadian history, including the role of our military, and on what equality means to us. Gender-based violence is a bad thing.</p>
<p>Discover Canada explains how elections work and how the justice system works. It describes our economy and our regions. It is a comprehensive guide, yet easy to read -- a perfect primer for new citizens.</p>
<p>It raises a question, though. It's nice to think that this 62-page booklet will make a difference for many of the the people arriving here, although volunteering at a food bank might not be top of mind to a cold, wet person scrambling up the rocks on our coast or scurrying across the border under cover of darkness.</p>
<p>Still, it's nice to think it will start them on the right path. If we all think real hard, maybe we can stop the rain and maybe we can make every newcomer pick up litter, too.</p>
<p>Here's the problem. Over the past couple of decades, Canada has been admitting, on average, about 200,000 people a year. Our population is about 33 million. In other words, one out of 165 people has arrived in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Back in 1913, we allowed 400,000 people in. Our population was seven million. One out of 18 was fresh off the boat -- and since so many of them went to the Prairies, in some regions of that barren land, 18 out of 18 would have been a newbie.</p>
<p>Back then, a concerted effort to tell newcomers how they should live would have had much more impact. Today? It's a wonderful idea, but it won't matter all that much.</p>
<p>If getting a message to one out of every 165 people will make a difference, perhaps we should try giving the H1N1 vaccine to one of every 165. It would be just as effective.</p>
<p>We need to spread the word to everyone -- and here is a radical thought.</p>
<p>Why not let our political leaders know that we expect them to live by the code they will find in Discover Canada?</p>
<p>Let's put them to the standard expressed by the booklet. They would have to agree to obey the law, to work hard, to help others without pay and to protect our heritage and environment.</p>
<p>They're actions could make a big difference when it comes time to vote.</p>
<p>There is huge cynicism about the electoral process these days because voters have started to believe that their ballots do not matter. The politicians have lied to us so often, or hid the truth until after the election, that voters have every reason to be cynical.</p>
<p>If our elected leaders show that they are willing to accept the responsibilities along with the rights (and the benefits) of office, perhaps some of us who were born here will start to think that the words printed in Discover Canada pertain to this country, and not some mythical place where the sun always shines and the grass is always green and everyone smiles because they love their neighbours.</p>
<p>Our politicians should lead by example. Is that too much to ask?</p>

<p>B.C. likely has seen the worst of the H1N1 pandemic's second wave but citizens should not become complacent and pass up the vaccine, the province's chief medical health officer said yesterday.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall told reporters indicators like visits to doctors' offices by patients reporting flu-like illnesses are dropping all over the province, with the exception of the north, which has lagged southern areas in infection.</p>
<p>He said as of yesterday, the province had 42 patients with H1N1 on hospital ventilating machines. That represents 12 per cent of the province's capacity.</p>
<p>B.C. has 250,000 doses of the vaccine to administer this week and is expecting 258,000 more next week.</p>

<p>I think the time has come to panic. But not about catching the H1N1 "swine flu." And not about the alleged risks of the vaccine that can protect against it. For the vast majority of people, the flu will mean no more than a week or so of misery, not different from previous versions. As far as the risk of the vaccine goes, it's minimal. However, there is something to panic about: the stunning amount of misinformation being bandied about.</p>
<p>I freely admit to not having expertise in this complex area, but I think I do have expertise in judging who does. And that would be the scientists at Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, the World Health Organization, Health Canada and major universities. These immunologists, virologists, toxicologists and epidemiologists spend their lives researching and evaluating vaccines. I trust their opinion, which is based on experimental evidence, over that of naturopaths, homeopaths, chiropractors and various graduates of the University of <span class="companylink">Google</span>, for whom evidence-based medicine is a foreign concept.</p>
<p>No rational person with a plumbing or electrical problem would seek help from a former Playboy centrefold, a comedian who specializes in facial contortions or a retired neurosurgeon. We would seek out a licensed plumber or an electrician. Yet when it comes to immunology, a field more complex than plumbing or wiring, many see no conundrum in being swayed by the rhetoric of Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey or Dr. Russell Blaylock, none of whom are immunologists.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the lay press often presents the pro and con arguments about vaccines as if they had equal weight. They do not. The vast majority of knowledgeable scientists recognize vaccination as one of the greatest advances in the history of public health, while at the same time being fully aware that there are some risks. The point, though, is that they judge these risks to be significantly outweighed by the benefits. On the other hand, the very loud and often verbally abusive anti-vaccine minority greatly exaggerates the risks and minimizes the benefits. Unfortunately emotion often trumps science. And conspiracy theories can be seductive.</p>
<p>One of the most convoluted tales is spun by Australian "investigative journalist" Jane Burgermeister. She contends that the H1N1 virus was genetically engineered and released by pharmaceutical companies so that they could then reap the profits from marketing vaccines. That claim almost sounds reasonable when compared with her other allegation that there is "evidence that an international corporate syndicate, which has annexed high government office inside the United States, is intent on carrying out a mass genocide using an artificial (genetic) flu pandemic virus and a forced vaccination program." What possible reason can there be for decimating the public in this fashion? "To transfer control of the United States to the World Health Organization, the UN and affiliated security forces."</p>
<p>No, the H1N1 virus was not engineered by Big Pharma for financial gain. Nor is there any attempt to "cull" the population by the American government, and there is no callous disregard for public health by releasing an untested vaccine.</p>
<p>Of course when it comes to a new vaccine, there can be no guarantee of 100% safety. But there has been adequate testing of this vaccine, which is produced the exact same way that seasonal flu vaccines have been produced for decades. Over 10 million doses of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine have already been administered with no more than the usual minor side effects.</p>
<p>One of the noisiest anti-vaccinationists is former neurosurgeon Dr. Russell Blaylock. Some of his allegations about vaccines can be instantly shown to be wrong. For example, contrary to his charges, there never has been any squalene adjuvant in any U.S. vaccine. Adjuvants are added to increase the efficiency of the body's reaction to the active ingredients in a vaccine, so that a smaller amount of vaccine goes a longer way. In any case, Squalene has been used in Europe and Canada for years without any problems being reported.</p>
<p>Any time vaccination is mentioned, the issue of thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative used in some vaccines, also rears its head. Numerous studies have investigated the allegation that mercury in vaccines is linked to developmental problems such as autism. No such connection has been found. One of the best studies was carried out by McGill researchers who surveyed almost 28,000 children born between 1987 and 1998, a period when thimerosal was widely used. There was no link with autism or any other developmental disorder. Another study at the University of California looked at 452 children aged two to five, who were either developing normally or had developmental problems such as autism spectrum disorder. There were no differences in blood mercury levels between autistic children and children with normal development.</p>
<p>Russell Blaylock promotes vitamin D as a weapon against the flu. Vitamin D does play a role in immune function. But catching the flu is not a sign of immune deficiency. And the most recent double-blind study, carried out with 162 adults taking 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily during the flu season, showed no benefit in decreasing the incidence or severity of upper respiratory tract infections. Of course good nutrition is important</p>
<p>for bolstering immune function, and taking a vitamin D supplement is a good idea for various reasons, even if it doesn't play a critical role in protection against viral diseases. However, there is no evidentiary basis to suggest, as Blaylock does, that fish oil or antioxidants help with H1N1.</p>
<p>The anti-vaccine crowd commonly brings up the possible link between vaccines and Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare but potentially dangerous neurological disease. That possible connection arose in 1976 when 48 million Americans were inoculated against the swine flu and 532 developed Guillain-Barre. That means roughly 10 cases per million vaccinated. No such relationship has been found with any vaccine since that time, suggesting that there was a problem with that specific vaccine, perhaps bacterial contamination. But here is the important statistic. The flu itself can cause Guillain-Barre -- somewhere between 40 and 70 cases for every million people who get come down with influenza. In other words, the risk of getting Guillain-Barre from the flu is 40 times greater than the risk of getting it from the vaccine.</p>
<p>Life offers us no guarantees -- except death. Everything comes down to a risk-benefit analysis. And I choose to carry out that analysis based on evidence-based science and expert opinion rather than on the unsubstantiated blather of conspiracy theorists. So I'll be rolling up my sleeve for the H1N1 vaccine, as will my wife, children and grandchildren. - Joe Schwarcz is director, McGill University Office for Science and Society.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Labs have difficulty tracking pathogens</b>
</div><div>By Steve Rennie   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>309 words</div><div>16 November 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Government labs, including the one handling samples of H1N1 flu, struggle to keep track of viruses and bacteria, a recent audit found.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada document warns weak controls at federal facilities could allow harmful pathogens to go missing, or be used for non-scientific purposes.</p>
<p>"The tracking systems and processes currently in use have difficulty accounting for pathogens cultivated in the laboratory environment," the audit says.</p>
<p>The agency's findings earlier this year came as scientists at Winnipeg's National Microbiology Laboratory were testing hundreds of samples of what now is known as the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>"Some facilities incorporate a mixture of manual and electronic recording or tracking systems," the audit says, "which could result in a pathogen being misplaced or become the subject of unauthorized activity."</p>
<p>Such was the case earlier this year when 22 vials of biological material went missing from the National Microbiology Laboratory.</p>
<p>A scientist at the lab allegedly swiped vials containing safe traces of the Ebola gene in January. But officials only became aware the vials were missing in May when U.S. authorities arrested the former employee at the Manitoba-North Dakota border.</p>
<p>The vials apparently went unnoticed for so long because the lab has are tens of thousands of vials of non-infectious material.</p>
<p>The head of the lab, Dr. Frank Plummer, said at the time that high-level pathogens are subject to rigorous inventory and the workers who handle them are under strict security.</p>
<p>But security isn't as tight for non-infectious materials.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency's audit, dated June 25, says labs are following biosafety guidelines - but that those measures "could be enhanced."</p>
<p>The audit recommended the agency come up with a standard way of tracking and accounting for pathogens.</p>

<p>London, Ont.</p>
<p>Toronto entrepreneur</p>
<p>Schreiner to head Green party</p>
<p>Toronto businessman and entrepreneur Mike Schreiner is the new leader of the Green Party of Ontario. He was the only candidate running to replace outgoing leader Frank de Jong. Schreiner was confirmed to the position Saturday evening at the party's leadership convention in London. De Jong led the party for 16 years and announced his resignation earlier this year. As for where he'll run in 2011, Schreiner said he hasn't made that decision yet. But the party, he said, is targeting a number of key ridings - including Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound, where they finished a strong second in 2007.</p>
<p>Edmonton</p>
<p>Rally held to demand</p>
<p>Khadr's return to Canada</p>
<p>Several dozen people held a rally in downtown Edmonton to demand that Omar Khadr be sent back to Canada to face trial in a civilian court. Khadr, 23, is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. U.S. authorities have announced that Khadr is among a group of terror suspects who will be moved to the U.S. to face justice there. Charlene Scharf, who is with the Edmonton chapter of Amnesty International, argues that Khadr was a child soldier when he allegedly killed a U.S. soldier and didn't fully understand what he was doing. Federal government lawyers argued at a Supreme Court hearing on Friday that it's up to elected officials, not the courts, to decide whether Khadr should be sent back to Canada.</p>

<p>Santa asks parents to keep</p>
<p>their sick children at home</p>
<p>Santa has a message for parents preparing to visit him at the mall this holiday season: Ho-Ho-Hold your children at home if they've got H1N1 flu. And with fears of H1N1 sweeping the country, shopping centres everywhere are taking precautions to avoid spreading the virus. Santa's helpers will have hand-sanitizer and wipes at many venues, while the big man himself may also carry extra pairs of gloves. But public health officials say there is no need to jingle alarm bells - sitting your tots on Santa's knee is no more risky than sending them to school or daycare.</p>

<p>Ontario offers $200,000 in aid</p>
<p>to help Philippines</p>
<p>Victims of a string of typhoons in the Philippines are getting a helping hand from Premier Dalton McGuinty. He says Ontario will give $200,000 to relief efforts in the country. Back-to-back storms in late September and early October killed more than 900 people and left tens of thousands homeless. A third typhoon in late October killed at least seven more. The money, announced Sunday, will be channelled through the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. In a prepared statement, McGuinty offered his prayers and thoughts to the country as it works to rebuild.</p>

<p>Bus commuters face being stranded after talks break down</p>
<p>Bus commuters in London will be looking for other ways of getting around the city today. Talks have broken down between the London Transit Commission and the union representing 450 of the city's transit workers, paving the way for a strike last night at midnight.The two sides met yesterday in a last-ditch effort to hammer out a contract, but were unsuccessful. London's 35 bus routes handle nearly 80,000 trips each day.</p>

<p>No fair.</p>
<p>According to Ryerson Rams coach Sandy Pothier, her women's basketball team was playing at a significant disadvantage against the McMaster Marauders on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Mac won that Ontario University Athletics contest 76-48 at home.</p>
<p>"McMaster didn't have to play (Friday) night," Pothier said. "They were well-prepared and rested. We played an overtime game (an 84-79 win in Thunder Bay against Lakehead) and then (had to) get on a plane to come here."</p>
<p>Mac was scheduled to be in action Friday. However, its game against the Varsity Blues was postponed earlier in the day by the league because some of the Toronto players came down with the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"I think it's an unfair competitive advantage when the other team doesn't play the night before. That resulted in some of us not having legs," said Pothier.</p>
<p>Mac (3-0) had a week off before taking on the East's Rams (4-2).</p>
<p>A pair of rookies sparked the Mac attack. Forwards Nicole Rosenkranz (Niagara Falls St. Paul) and Jaklynn Nimec (Saltfleet) scored 14 and 12 points, respectively. Fifth-year point guard Taylor Smith had 12 points and nine assists, while Rebecca Rewi contributed 13 points. Mac's Hailey Milligan grabbed a game-high 10 rebounds.</p>
<p>"Each game is a stepping stone," Mac coach Theresa Burns said. "We want to be better and better. It's a long-term process. What we're aiming for is to be ready for February (when Mac hosts the national championship).</p>
<p>"We executed well at both ends tonight. It was the best team defence we've played all year."</p>
<p>Burns said she knew Rosenkranz and Nimec could step in and have an impact as first-year players.</p>
<p>"They have a knack for getting their hands on the ball," she said. "They are very athletic and know their way around the paint. They board for you and can step out and shoot. They have composure and play a solid defensive game."</p>
<p>Burlington's Lisa Goldring had 11 for the Rams.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Youth mental health versus H1N1; Two Ontario crises: one gets scant resources, the other immediate funding</b>
</div><div>Sarah Cannon  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>838 words</div><div>16 November 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>My daughter suffers from a potentially life-threatening illness. Her father lost his life to the same illness.</p>
<p>The symptoms of her life-threatening illness are the second-leading cause of death among our youth’ second only to accidental death. The symptoms, when left untreated, claim the lives of our youth more than any other illness, more than cancer and heart disease, and yet treatment remains difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>It may be surprising that the illness my daughter suffers from, the illness that eventually claimed her father's life, is that of mental illness -- in their cases, bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Recently, we have been saturated with information on the H1N1 crisis. This crisis is indeed one that is having tragic effects, and without doubt should be addressed immediately to prevent further loss of life.</p>
<p>It strikes me that the attention and urgency it has prompted is another clear demonstration of the lack of equity addressing the child and youth mental health crisis when compared to physical health crises.</p>
<p>Since April, 33 deaths have been attributed to H1N1 in Ontario. Since April, death to children suffering from mental illness is double that.</p>
<p>On average, more than two youths a week take their lives as a result of their mental-illness symptoms not being adequately treated.</p>
<p>As I write this, there are 82 admissions to hospitals attributable to H1N1 in Ontario. Toronto alone has more than 82 admissions in their psychiatric in-patient beds. Approximately 100 clinics have been established to address the H1N1 crisis -- 50 in the last week.</p>
<p>The average wait time for children to receive treatment for mental illness is more than six months.</p>
<p>Our government has committed to setting aside $600 million to deal with the H1N1 crisis.</p>
<p>In the last 16 years, children's mental health has received only three annual increases and no additional funding. The 2009 budget provided a 3 per cent increase to health care -- children's mental health nothing.</p>
<p>More lives are lost from the symptoms of mental illness than any other physical illness, yet no additional funding, and years of no investment. Lack of investment and funding is causing decreases in the already-scarce services available.</p>
<p>When I learned that $600 million has been dedicated to addressing the H1N1 crisis, and then considered the lack of funding for nearly two decades to children's mental health services, I was angry.</p>
<p>More lives are lost weekly because of the symptoms of mental illness than to H1N1; more admissions to hospitals have occurred in the same six-month time frame. But still -- nothing.</p>
<p>Our governments are elected to protect and preserve our quality of life, and it is definitely incumbent upon them to react immediately, and to make the lives of those they represent the most immediate priority.</p>
<p>Ask yourself -- are the lives of children and youth diagnosed with mental illness being considered a priority?</p>
<p>The children who suffer and consequently lose the battle to symptoms have a treatable illness. Their deaths are a direct result of preventable symptoms.</p>
<p>It is estimated that one in five children has a mental illness, yet only one in six of those children is receiving treatment.</p>
<p>We are demanding that our governments find a way to ensure all lives are saved and protected from H1N1. Are we doing the same for the children and youth suffering from mental illness?</p>
<p>Perhaps the reason for the urgency in the response to H1N1 is the contagious nature, that if allowed to spread will "infect others;" the snowball effect potentially devastating.</p>
<p>Mental health issues are not contagious in the same way we "catch a virus," but the impact they have on those around the person suffering is devastating, causing a ripple effect that impacts on the province, not only in mortality rates, but the economy as well.</p>
<p>Lack of investment and lack of adequate funding costs Ontario millions of dollars, as well as lives.</p>
<p>If the government has the capacity to react to a crisis that was not allocated funding when the budget was set -- a crisis that in comparison has developed quickly -- then I suggest we are not holding them accountable and demanding answers to explain the lack of urgency, attention and funding to mental health services for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>The comparison is two crises, unnecessary lives being lost, both "infecting" communities -- and one receiving funding and attention.</p>
<p>It may be a completely different perspective, and perhaps not a popular one, but I can't help but think that if we reacted with the same urgency and commitment to the crisis of mental health, perhaps my daughter would be less at risk.</p>

</p>
<p>We have recently observed the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
<p>On Nov. 9, 1989, freedom of movement through formerly East and West Berlin was restored, some 28 years after the wall was built. That momentous event presaged the fall of the Soviet Union and Soviet-style regimes throughout eastern Europe. Only a few months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Nelson Mandela was released from prison after 27 years.</p>
<p>In what seemed like a heartbeat, the 40-year-old system of Soviet satellites and the 40-year-old system of apartheid began to crumble before our eyes. It seemed like a new burst of individual liberty was at hand around the world. The feeling was catching, and millions were caught up in it. Students in Beijing protested in Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>The prevailing wisdom was that democracy had outlived communism. Liberty had outlived a system that replaced individual responsibility with bureaucracy, central planning and oppressive government. We in the west had won, and our values had triumphed. Twenty years later, we have the opportunity to measure that win.</p>
<p>So the central question is: Which values have triumphed? The values that we promoted throughout the Cold War -- the values of democracy and personal responsibility -- or the values of the cold grey eyes of the bureaucrat?</p>
<p>As a political science student in the late '70s, I learned that the American view of the world was one of rough and ready capitalism, where individual responsibility and reward reigned supreme. The Canadian view was softer: a mixed economy, where government intervened more to help the weak and to accomplish things in a setting where large pools of capital were hard to come by.</p>
<p>The American approach was one of enormous risk, enormous reward; the Canadian one was about the National Dream and national health programs. But underlying even the Canadian view was respect for individual liberty and individual responsibility.</p>
<p>Somewhere, things seemed to have changed, and, unless it is my imagination, they have changed in the time period during which the benefits of winning the Cold War should have been in full flower. Canada has become a nation of people accustomed to being told what to do and when, a people looking for government to solve our problems and, even worse, a people conditioned to informing authorities on their neighbours.</p>
<p>In 2000, bylaw enforcement at the city of Ottawa received approximately 18,000 calls from people complaining about their neighbours. This past year, that number had jumped to 80,000. That's a lot of people informing the authorities about some kind of bylaw violation, rather than dealing with it face to face.</p>
<p>Authorities have moved from creating laws that prevent us from harming others, to regulating how we live, and the authorities do this because they believe they know better. Which is easier: for the McGuinty government to honour election promises on clean energy, or to tell us what light bulbs to use? Which is easier: to really determine if there is a problem with lawn sprays, or simply to tell us not to use them?</p>
<p>City councillors, who think that, despite their lack of expertise and despite the absence of meaningful study, it is acceptable to tell property owners that they cannot open restaurants just because a few whiny residents don't like the noise or traffic?</p>
<p>As I've said before, the tree on my lawn is mine, and neither the city nor my neighbours have the right to say anything about whether I cut it down or not. If the city wants to expropriate my tree, let them pay me for it.</p>
<p>The recent experience with delivery of the swine flu vaccine is another example. The central planning and efficiency of this exercise has produced six-hour lines, not unlike those for bread in the old Soviet Union. Just like in those bad old days, there are people who have gamed the system, like the old party apparatchiks who always found ways to move to the head of the line.</p>
<p>Finally, we have our politicians. The Liberal party and its recent habit of thwarting democracy by appointing candidates -- and their leader -- smacks of nothing less than the old Soviet system.</p>
<p>When you add it all up, did the Wall really fall, or did we just change places? Over the past 20 years, we have allowed our leaders to change our society, and we need to change it back.</p>

</p>
<p>By Sunday morning, more than 1.3 million Quebecers would have been inoculated against the H1N1 virus, according to Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc, who said Saturday the strategies put in place to deal with the flu pandemic were working.</p>
<p>Flu clinics, opened to divert anxious patients away from emergency rooms, have eased conditions in Quebec hospitals. There are 42 clinics open seven days a week across the province, 15 of them in Montreal, he said.</p>
<p>The number of new hospitalizations, still on the rise, is also not as worrisome as health authorities initially expected, though some regions, such as Montreal's South Shore, are being hit harder than others.</p>
<p>There have been 335 people hospitalized with H1N1 in the area since Aug. 30.</p>
<p>There were four new reported H1N1-related deaths in Quebec since Friday, bringing the number of flu-related deaths in the province to 28 since the second wave began Aug. 30. There were 25 deaths in the first wave, which began last spring.</p>

</div><div>Jennifer Sygo   </div>
<div>National Post; For Canwest News Service</div>
<div>1060 words</div><div>16 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>With all the H1N1 discourse and debate, the nation's focus is definitely on flu season. With so much attention given to the prevention and treatment of the flu, it seems that the other big winter illness-- the common cold--is getting less attention. While the common cold is typically the gentler sickness of the two--it still allows many to go to work and school, for example, while the flu usually lays people up for a week or more--it is still a drain on us, both as individuals and as a wider population.</p>
<p>To protect ourselves from getting a cold or the flu, physical barriers usually rule the day:hand-washing, not sharing cups or water bottles, or staying out of busy public places altogether are strategies that we hear about over and over again.</p>
<p>But what about your diet? Is there anything you can take that will make you less likely to get the cold? And once you're in the clutches of one, is there anything that can make a cold's duration shorter or its symptoms less severe?</p>
<p>While there are numerous purported cold remedies on the market, here are the highlights of a few popular nutritional supplements and their possible benefits--or lack thereof --in preventing the common cold.</p>
<p>Vitamin C</p>
<p>When it comes to cold prevention, who doesn't think about popping some vitamin C? After decades of recommendations based largely around the prevention of scurvy, vitamin C made its way into our collective consciousness with two-time Nobel laureate Linus Pauling's assertions that mega-dosing was a pathway to good health. Now, many of us don't think twice about popping several thousand milligrams at a time, and there is a widely held belief that taking vitamin C at the onset of a cold will hold it at bay.</p>
<p>But what does the research say? In 2007, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews-- basically, the granddaddy of evidence-based reviews on medical research--published an updated review of vitamin C and the common cold, and found that, in a nutshell, yes, taking vitamin</p>
<p>C regularly can reduce the length one suffers from a cold--by eight per cent in adults and 14 per cent in children. But when taken after the onset of symptoms, there was no effect on the length or severity. In other words, mega-dosing on vitamin</p>
<p>C after you feel your first sniffle doesn't seem to do much.</p>
<p>Although the general population may not benefit from taking vitamin C for a cold, there is some evidence that athletes training at a high level (marathon runners, for example), and those exposed to extreme cold temperatures can benefit from popping a few pills.</p>
<p>Vitamin D</p>
<p>The sunshine vitamin plays a role in immune system function, and at least according to early evidence, it might help to prevent respiratory tract infections. In fact, a study published in the February edition of the journal Archives of Internal Medicine found that individuals with a lower circulating level of vitamin D had a higher likelihood of developing a respiratory tract infection.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a more recent study, published in the October issue of Epidemiology and Infection, found that subjects given 2000 IU of vitamin D daily over a 12-week period were no less likely to develop a respiratory tract infection. Since there is very limited research on the role vitamin D plays in the development of the common cold, the bottom line is that we simply don't know enough to be able to do anything but speculate. Having said that, since so many Canadians are vitamin D deficient by late fall or early winter--the time when cold and flu season hits full stride--taking a vitamin D supplement probably isn't a bad idea, even if it is for other health benefits than cold prevention.</p>
<p>Garlic</p>
<p>Long used by numerous cultures for taste and health, garlic's antimicrobial and antiviral properties has earned it a reputation as a classic cold-fighter.</p>
<p>But does the evidence agree? According to a Cochrane review published earlier this year, researchers found there is insufficient evidence to suggest that garlic should be used to either prevent or treat the common cold. Bear in mind, however, that the issue was not so much that garlic isn't useful, but rather that there haven't been enough well-controlled trials to allow a clear conclusion to be drawn, one way or the other.</p>
<p>In fact, in one double-blinded trial, subjects given garlic pills containing 180 mg of allicin (the active compound in garlic) for 12 weeks developed only a third as many colds as those given a placebo (dummy pill) for the same amount of time. Since double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials are considered the gold standard for proof, the results would certainly suggest that garlic has a role to play, at least in cold prevention, but more good trials are needed.</p>
<p>Zinc</p>
<p>A known immune-system modulator, there is some research to suggest that zinc can be used to manage respiratory tract infections, pneumonia and the common cold. While there is some indication that zinc supplements might be most beneficial for children and the elderly--in other words, those with weakened or compromised immune systems--the data are inconsistent.</p>
<p>As for the benefits of using zinc lozenges to treat the common cold, the reviewers at Cochrane deemed the data inconclusive. Yes, there are several well-controlled trials, and some have demonstrated that zinc lozenges can, in fact, reduce the duration or the severity of the common cold. But others have shown no effect. The difference could be the result of the type of zinc used and its bioavailability (the ability of the body to uptake and use a particular form of a nutrient), but the possibility of bias was also raised.</p>

Dietary changes, including eating garlic, may help ward off the
common cold. But we're guessing Ted Maczka, the "Fish Lake Garlic
Man" of Prince Edward County, Ont., may have already known.

<div id="hd"><b>Longtime volunteer retires from auxiliary at age 90</b>
</div><div>Valerie Berenyi   </div>

</p>
<p>For more than 45 years, Velma Leboldus has volunteered every Saturday at a canteen in Bethany Calgary.</p>
<p>The tiny 90-year-old sells candy, greeting cards, toiletries and other items to the staff and 465 residents of the long-term care facility in West Hillhurst.</p>
<p>Run by the Bethany Calgary Ladies Auxiliary, the Tuck Shop's considerable proceeds have gone toward improving residents' quality of life. Now, the ladies auxiliary is about to dissolve and Leboldus has decided it's time to "retire." Her last shift is Saturday.</p>
<p>"It's been my hobby," says Leboldus. "I've gotten more out of it than I've put into it."</p>
<p>Working around people and helping others has given her a strong sense of purpose and it's kept her sharp. Clad in a bright blue smock and standing only four foot 11, Leboldus seemed decades younger as she efficiently dispensed goodies, counted out change and wrote receipts.</p>
<p>She's adorable, one of those irresistible people you just want to hug. At nearly six feet, I towered over her, a giantess in the small Tuck Shop where she told me a bit about herself and the group she volunteers with.</p>
<p>The Bethany Calgary Ladies Auxiliary was founded in 1961 by volunteers from the city's various Lutheran churches. The good ladies operated a portable canteen, sewed nightgowns and name tags, washed and set hair, mended residents' clothing and wrote letters.</p>
<p>Over the years, their role changed and they began organizing fundraising teas--a Strawberry Tea, a Poinsettia Tea and a staff appreciation tea. With the Tuck Shop's profits, they raised a lot of money--all of which went to make residents more comfortable.</p>
<p>In 2003, for example, they donated $10,000 to help buy a bus for outings. In 1996, they donated $10,000 for a palliative care room. From 1993 to 1995, they donated $57,000 worth of building renovations, patio furniture and handibus tickets. Every Christmas, they bought, wrapped and hand-delivered a present to each resident-- 6,750 gifts in the past 15 years, by one count.</p>
<p>Leboldus joined the Bethany Calgary Ladies Auxiliary in the early 1960s, then the mother of three young kids, which she'd had late in life.</p>
<p>A farm girl from Compeer, near the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, she waited a long time to marry her childhood sweetheart, Gab. He was sick with pleurisy, which confined him to a sanitorium for years, but an operation in 1955 restored his health. They married shortly after when she was 38 and he 43, common now, but unusual in those days.</p>
<p>"We knew we were meant for each other," said Leboldus, who had worked as a postmistress until the couple married and began raising their family in Calgary.</p>
<p>"I was just so thankful to have had those three children. They've given me so much."</p>
<p>The ladies auxiliary became a huge part of her life as a stay-at-home mom, and she often brought her kids, Ronda, Lyle and Joy, to help out in the Tuck Shop or at fundraising teas. When they grew up, she took her three grandchildren.</p>
<p>When Gab passed away in 1971, Leboldus took a full-time job as a bookkeeper and scaled her volunteer efforts back to evenings and weekends.</p>
<p>Once she shifted to part-time work at age 65, however, she began volunteering every Thursday and Saturday afternoon at the Tuck Shop, a commitment the great-grandmother of three kept until now, despite circulatory problems with her legs.</p>
<p>But, membership in the Bethany Calgary Ladies Auxiliary has dwindled to 14 members, most of whom are now in their 80s.</p>
<p>"More young women are having to work outside the home and it's hard to get new volunteers," Leboldus explains. So, the nonprofit is dissolving and operation of the Tuck Shop will be assumed by the Bethany's volunteer services department.</p>
<p>"It's important to recognize their legacy," says Mary Jardine, manager of volunteer services at Bethany Care Society, adding that a tea was planned for the ladies in early November but, given the H1N1 flu pandemic, it's been postponed until things "settle down."</p>
<p>Some of the auxiliary will continue volunteering at the Bethany, but not Leboldus.</p>
<p>"It's sad to give it up," she says, "but it's time."</p>

</p>
<p>We hear the words "swine flu".We think death, we fear death. Frequent news broadcasts list the number of people who died or were hospitalized because of H1N1. Our fears increase. We wash our hands more frequently; we use hand sanitizers; we cough into our elbows, and we even stay home if we cough or have a temperature. Well, some of us do. We don't want to die; we demand vaccines, now!</p>
<p>Yet we drive like idiots on our roads. We drink and drive, and we distract ourselves while driving even though we know we could kill someone. Our rationalization is, "It won't happen to me. I know how to drive. I can safely follow too closely, talk on my cellphone while driving, speed, refuse to use my signal lights, ignore traffic lights, etc."</p>
<p>It is time that the media, insurance companies, the police, and Alberta Health provide us with weekly reports, at the least, with comparative statistics regarding deaths and hospitalizations due to H1N1, seasonal flu, SARS, homicides, and car crashes.</p>
<p>Many resources are available to "save us" from H1N1. Some people listen and follow the health-care instructions. They don't want to die, and they don't want others to suffer because of their negligence. When will we change our behaviours on the road?Many people die because of drivers' negligent choices. Many people's lives are forever altered because someone chosen to ignore driving rules and warnings. It is time we all made a concerted personal effort to support life, our own, and the lives of all in our community. Oppositional defiance is not the answer.</p>

</div><div>Jodie Sinnema   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>947 words</div><div>16 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>The boss of Alberta's health superboard suspects hospitals will be hit hard in the coming weeks as the H1N1 flu infects more people.</p>
<p>"We are now seeing the impact of H1N1 on our hospital beds and intensive care units," Stephen Duckett, CEO of Alberta Health Services, wrote in his public blog.</p>
<p>"We have done some modelling of what a 12-week epidemic would look like and the impact on ICUs (intensive care units) and hospital beds is slightly greater at this stage of the epidemic than we projected."</p>
<p>As of Friday, 755 Albertans have needed hospital care since the flu first began spreading in April. They are typically filling one-quarter to one-third of all ICU beds in provincial hospitals, health officials have reported.</p>
<p>A total of 38 Albertans have died since April. All were adults, except one girl from central Alberta who had chronic health problems that complicated her illness. Eighteen of those deaths--or close to 50 per cent--were reported in the last nine days as the province moves toward the peak of the pandemic's second wave. A third and fourth wave are expected later this winter and spring.</p>
<p>Despite the recent surge in H1N1 deaths, Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said the pandemic virus appears no deadlier than regular seasonal influenza and that there could actually be substantially fewer flu deaths than normal this season.</p>
<p>Although H1N1 is disproportionately infecting more children and otherwise healthy young adults, "the mortality rate from this is no worse than seasonal flu," Butler-Jones told Canwest News Service.</p>
<p>"The individual risk of severe disease or dying if you happen to get the flu is very similar today as it was back in June. It's just that we're starting to see a lot more people affected."</p>
<p>That's what Duckett predicts for Alberta.</p>
<p>"We are still only a third of the way through the pandemic and I expect things to get tougher over the next few weeks, especially in terms of demand on hospitals," Duckett wrote on his blog Saturday. "We will therefore need to start reallocating resources to a clinical area or service if patient volumes or staff illness require us to do so."</p>
<p>That could include the cancellation of elective surgeries such as hip or knee replacements or cataract removal.</p>
<p>Patients with flu-related illnesses could fill surgical recovery rooms, for instance. Until now, no cancellations have happened due to the H1N1 swell.</p>
<p>"H1N1 is the highest priority for this organization," Duckett wrote. He acknowledged the vaccination rollout "got off to a rocky start" when mass clinics were overwhelmed by demand just as the vaccine supply dried up from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>"It is easy in hindsight to be critical of that decision," he wrote.</p>
<p>While initial polling showed only 40 to 49 per cent of Canadians wanted to be vaccinated, that demand soon doubled to 75 to 80 per cent, Duckett explained. Healthy people lined up for hours alongside people in wheelchairs, pregnant mothers and children with asthma.</p>
<p>"It led to inappropriately long waits and we should have been better at line management earlier," Duckett wrote. The province has since limited the vaccine to high-risk groups.</p>
<p>"But with all due respect to our critics, these issues need to be considered in the context of the results (staff) achieved. We're moving very quickly, faster than other provinces, which means we are protecting Albertans sooner. I'm proud of that."</p>
<p>Butler-Jones lauded the public for trying to prevent infection by coughing into their sleeves, staying home if they're sick and getting anti-viral drugs if symptoms are worsening.</p>
<p>"The fact that we haven't had more deaths and more people in (intensive-care units) I think is a testimony to people doing the rights things to both prevent and reduce the severity of disease," he said.</p>
<p>"When you do take this disease seriously, you can actually dramatically reduce the number of people with severe illness and death. So the usual 2,000 to 8,000 range(of flu-related deaths) that we see with seasonal flu, we might actually be able to reduce that substantially."</p>
<p>Experts said the rates of serious illness and death are far from the levels predicted for a new pandemic virus and that, based on the information available up until now, H1N1 is not on track to causing disease and death on the scope or scale of the flu pandemics of the 20th century.</p>
<p>According to the latest analysis from the Public Health Agency of Canada, there has been a drop in severe infections.</p>
<p>It can take two to three weeks for people with influenza to get sick enough to end up in hospital, and even longer for them to die, said Dr. Richard Schabas, a former chief medical officer of health for Ontario.</p>
<p>During the SARS outbreak in 2003, "people had the impression right through April of 2003 that the SARS outbreak was still roaring along, because they kept reporting deaths," Schabas said. "But what they didn't say was that these were people who got their SARS back in March, and it took them two, three, four, five weeks to die.</p>
<p>"It's the same thing with influenza. Most people with influenza don't die quickly. They die slowly. Continuing to report (deaths) as if it's a way of judging what the outbreak is doing is wrong."</p>
<p>He said school absenteeism and emergency rooms visits are more timely indicators.</p>

</p>
<p>It eludes me why TransLink awarded the HandyDart contract -- non-profit service -- to a for-profit company from outside our borders. We subsidize its profits with our taxes. Since you can't really expect this service to be efficient or profitable, profit has to come from somewhere. That would seem to be from the backs of the lowest-paid workers in the TransLink system.</p>
<p>TransLink has money woes and doesn't seem to care. The media don't care, so no one notices. Those affected are stuck at home.Our papers have lately been so full of H1N1 and Olympic circuses that there's been no room for this issue. Why not? The elderly folks who need the system don't have years to wait.</p>

<div>310 words</div><div>16 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Disease-control experts are watching <span class="companylink">Google</span> to see how H1N1 is spreading, hoping it will allow them to follow infection rates in close to real time.</p>
<p>The theory is, follow the search numbers and you also follow the disease. The google.org/flu trends/ca page aggregates the flu-related search data and tracks the disease's activity around the world.</p>
<p>Graphs demonstrate that the <span class="companylink">Google</span> flu-query counts match almost exactly the traditional surveillance reports of the disease worldwide.</p>
<p>Canada measures at "intense," the highest level, but shows a sharp drop in the last week.</p>
<p>"It's really interesting," said Roy Wadia of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control. "The tool that is on the website shows you that there is a downturn."</p>
<p>Wadia said some mathematical models do predict a slowdown, but he remains cautious about forecasts. "It may be flattening," said Wadia, "but flu is unpredictable."</p>
<p>Wadia said the announcement on Friday that the vaccine will now be available to a wider group, including first responders, healthy children, seniors with chronic health conditions and health care workers, is good news.</p>
<p>Vaccine experts are now debating when and if "herd immunity" will kick in. Herd immunity is a theory that once a certain threshold of vaccinations has been achieved, the disease loses its foothold.</p>
<p>Wadia said he had certainly heard the term, but that with H1N1 there is no threshold number that he knows of.</p>
<p>"The best prevention is the vaccine," said Wadia.</p>
<p>Today, 258,000 doses of adjuvanted vaccine will roll into the province, bringing the total number of vaccine doses delivered to B.C. to 1,398,00 since the program began.</p>

<p>More paramedics showed up for work in the Lower Mainland on Sunday than on Saturday after the union and management spent a day wrangling before the B.C. Labour Relations Board.</p>
<p>Dozens of ambulance paramedics have been failing to show up for work, mostly in the Lower Mainland, after the province forced them to return to work, said Lee Doney, chief executive officer of the BC Ambulance Service.</p>
<p>Doney said in an interview Sunday that he asked the labour board on Saturday to declare the workers were participating in an illegal strike. The meeting lasted eight hours, ending at about 8 p.m. The vice-chair of the labour board appealed to the paramedics to show up for work, Doney said.</p>
<p>"I must admit things got better today, so we'll see what happens," Doney said.</p>
<p>He estimated the service would be short about 10 ambulances in the Lower Mainland on Sunday night, compared with as many as 35 on Friday night and Saturday morning. The Lower Mainland normally has 110 ambulances on duty.</p>
<p>Canadian Union of Public Employees B.C. president Barry O'Neill said there's no organized strike. He said workers probably aren't showing up because they're sick or exhausted because of long hours of overtime.</p>
<p>"People do get tired, and this last move by the government is a little disconcerting, and I guess they're saying, 'If I don't feel good because I'm burnt out then I'm not going to report for work,'" he said.</p>
<p>He said ambulance paramedics showed up for work when they were legally on strike, so they wouldn't organize an illegal strike. "The BC Ambulance Service is really looking goofy around this," he said.</p>
<p>He also questioned Doney's figures on the number of paramedics failing to report to work.</p>
<p>Ambulance workers can decide not to work, even if they're not sick. On Friday so many failed to show up that the BC Ambulance Service warned the public of possible delays in service for less serious calls.</p>
<p>On Saturday, more shifts were booked off and the service said it would be down 24 ambulances, including 10 in Metro Vancouver, and 10 in the Fraser Valley. Boston Bar, Hope, Agassiz, and Pemberton were without any ambulance and had to depend on neighbouring municipalities.</p>
<p>Doney said the service had to fly four to six paramedics from Vancouver Island to cover service on the mainland.</p>
<p>Doney said the ambulance service was "incredibly busy" on Friday night and praised those who did come into work.</p>
<p>Union spokesman BJ Chute said paramedics have been trying to raise awareness and address a staffing crisis in the province for years. He said the ambulance service was making "a pathetic attempt to blame paramedics for [the service's] shortcomings."</p>
<p>Chute said any paramedic shortage is the ambulance service's fault, because it has not filled job vacancies in the Lower Mainland as a cost-saving measure.</p>
<p>After the government announced its legislation ending the paramedics' strike, O'Neill warned on Nov. 9 that the dispute wasn't over.</p>
<p>"This week we'll have a strategy that will let the government know that what they've done is wrong," he said. "Paramedics will not just stand by idly, and this will not be resolved until they get an opportunity to bring to their members a collective agreement that they believe is fair and equitable. That's when this dispute will end."</p>
<p>The weekend's paramedic shortage is the latest conflict in a long saga of labour relations problems between the two sides.</p>
<p>Doney said the three-per-cent pay raise included in the one-year contract imposed on the paramedics is fair and the paramedics will have an opportunity to go back to the bargaining table on April 1 when the contract expires. "The system is stretched. I understand they're frustrated," he said, but added, "I think we've done everything we can to protect the paramedics. The reality is I think we've gone as far as we can."</p>
<p>Health Services Minister Kevin Falcon said paramedics were legislated back to work because of the H1N1 flu virus. Before the back-to-work legislation, they were working under an essential services order that did not include extra contract work for the Olympics.</p>
<p>Chute reiterated the strike was not just about compensation but also about increased training, access to training, and a better functioning ambulance service. The union has previously stated paramedics are leaving the profession due to high training costs and a low entry-level pay structure.</p>
<p>During the ambulance shortage, the service urged people who weren't in an emergency to consider other options than dialing 911 for an ambulance. These included going to walk-in clinics, calling HealthLinkBC at 811, or making their own way to the hospital.</p>

<p>School trustees say public education budgets have been cut to the bone, yet several districts found money this year for staff retreats and private meetings in such places as Harrison Hot Springs, Whistler and Semiahmoo Resort.</p>
<p>In August, Abbotsford district spent about $23,000 to send principals, vice-principals, education managers and trustees to Harrison Hot Springs for two days to discuss ethical decision-making.</p>
<p>Also last summer, Langley principals and vice-principals spent public funds earmarked for professional development on a Whistler conference while Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows principals and vice-principals used $26,000 in Pro-D funds to attend a two-day gathering in Semiahmoo, Wash.</p>
<p>West Vancouver principals and vice-principals, meanwhile, held a retreat closer to home at the Westin Bayshore Conference Centre, where the conference room rental and meals cost the district $9,531.</p>
<p>Burnaby principals also held a professional development conference in Whistler, although it wasn't immediately clear if they financed it with public or private dollars. Coquitlam principals gathered in Whistler as well, but a district spokeswoman said they paid their own personal expenses.</p>
<p>Principals and vice-principals in Kamloops-Thompson also covered their own travel and accommodation costs for a retreat at Sun Peaks Resort in September, but the public picked up a $900 bill for one meal.</p>
<p>About one-third of the 60 districts surveyed recently by The Vancouver Sun said they held no off-site retreats in 2009, although several said such retreats were regular events in previous years.</p>
<p>Port Alberni chair Larry Ransom said retreats were discontinued in his district several years ago as a cost-cutting measure. "We now hold annual board working sessions at the district office . . . [and] have asked schools to host their staff retreat/working sessions on-site and all have done so," he noted.</p>
<p>Four districts -- Southeast Kootenay, Kootenay Lake, Campbell River and Cowichan Valley -- did not reply to two requests for information e-mailed to their superintendents and one to board chairs over a four-week period. Gold Trail left a telephone message saying simply that the superintendent would not respond.</p>
<p>Although these costs represent only a small part of multimillion-dollar budgets, they come at a time when trustees are cutting services and warning that inadequate funding threatens public education.</p>
<p>"It's disrespectful of the taxpayer," David Komljenovic, president of the Kamloops Thompson Teachers' Association, said, adding that "every dime counts" in his district, where the possible closure of 11 schools is under discussion.</p>
<p>Cancelling the Sun Peaks retreat wouldn't solve the district's financial problems, but it would send a better signal to the public, he added.</p>
<p>Abbotsford superintendent Julie MacRae said she understands the criticisms. "We're concerned enough about it that we are reviewing our budget and the format of what we will do next year," she stated in an interview.</p>
<p>Sunshine Coast trustees are also unlikely to organize another retreat like the one they attended in February at the Painted Boat resort in Pender Harbour, said chair Silas White. They've also cancelled the get-together dinners they used to attend during provincial trustee meetings.</p>
<p>"This all amounts to peanuts in the way of possible savings," he said, adding that his district will need to find $1 million in savings next year. "I certainly wish it were as easy as cancelling a couple of events."</p>
<p>The Sun survey also found that Arrow Lakes trustees spent three days at Halcyon Hot Springs at a cost of $982.97, Prince Rupert trustees attended a two-day meeting off-site (location not specified) at a cost of $1,321, and Coast Mountain trustees held a two-day retreat at the Ripley Creek Inn at a cost of $6,501.66.</p>
<p>Okanagan-Skaha district didn't hold any off-site retreats this year, but trustees cancelled their annual summer leadership conference in Penticton after a public outcry over their promise to pay retired superintendent Gary Doi $52,500 to organize the three-day event.</p>
<p>Zoe Magnus, president of the Canadian Union of Public Employees local, said: "I was very concerned that our district was prepared to pay $52,500 . . . to arrange a three-day conference when we can't even provide day-time custodians in our school during the H1N1 pandemic," she said.</p>

<p>Canadians have the luxury of debating whether or not to get the H1N1 vaccine, for themselves and their children.</p>
<p>But this is a choice 24 million children worldwide do not have. In fact they have no access to immunizations that prevent diseases most of us have never even experienced like tetanus.</p>
<p>The Canadian International Development Agency is considering cancelling the Canadian International Immunization Initiative, one of the most effective foreign aid initiatives ever.</p>
<p>Every Canadian will have access to the H1N1 vaccine.  If CIDA renews funding for CIII, every child could have access to childhood immunizations.</p>

</p>
<p>The jolly man in the red suit asked for a favour: He was short-staffed and needed an extra clown to toss candies to children in Sunday's Santa Claus Parade.</p>
<p>Who could say no to Santa?</p>
<p>Not this reporter, who's been called a bozo enough times over the years to make clown duty a natural fit. But I had big red shoes to fill in the 105th edition of the annual parade.</p>
<p>What I didn't realize was that the smiling, sweetie-tossing clowns supporting Santa don't just donate their time. Each November these "celebrity clowns" - often Toronto's corporate elite, who remain anonymous behind white grease paint - keep the parade operating by paying a $1,000 fun fee, which my bosses at the Star paid, too.</p>
<p>This year, even in a bah-humbug economy, the clowns raised $200,000 toward the not-for-profit event's $1.3 million budget.</p>
<p>"It shows you that Santa is recession-proof," crowed parade co-chairman and clown-founder Ron Barbaro.</p>
<p>When it comes to Santa, it's astonishing what people will do.</p>
<p>Like arriving (on time) on parade day for the 6: 45 a.m. clown registration. Then slipping into a wide, multi-hued neon number that, for sure, made my butt look big. Pulling on a fire engine red wig, pretending it didn't highlight spider veins and crow's feet. Being lost under layers of thick, gooey makeup.</p>
<p>But with a million pieces of candy to share with excited kids along six kilometres of parade route, a clown needs a good game face. And the Star's harlequin looked the part.</p>
<p>A very special detour took 15 of us to Sick Kids' Hospital, with the other parade co-chairman, George Cohon of <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> fame, leading the visit. The H1N1 flu fright meant many children had to stay behind closed doors. But the open ones were a privilege to enter - even as delight sometimes turned to fright when the jesters got too close.</p>
<p>A police escort whisked us to join a clown convoy heading to the Bloor and Christie start. We'd noticed lots of people had staked out spots as early as 9 a.m. but two hours later, the numbers were swelling quickly on an unusually mild November morning. By the time the parade kicked off, with Burlington's Top Hat Marching Orchestra setting the jazzed-up Christmas tone, the crowds were thick, vocal and happy.</p>
<p>My job was unbelievable: Walk straight through the heart of Canada's largest city, deliver candy canes and jellies to children, chat, wave, absorb the energy of the city and delight as Barbaro and Cohon skipped along the entire route. (Barbaro, by the way, is 78, and Cohon is 72.)</p>
<p>So who's the clown now?</p>
<p>And a few of the amazing people I met along the way: Toronto native Vincenza Fogel, 53, who flies in every year (10 and counting) from her San Francisco home to be a clown; Margaret Way, 63, and 20-year-old son Oliver, who have been costumed characters together for two decades; and Enid Pagnini, a lively, lovely 81-year-old who walked the whole route dressed as a lamb.</p>
<p>Santa had asked for a favour but instead, in his Kris Kringle-y way, he delivered a gift: Families swaddled in love and a city, united, embracing a glorious afternoon.</p>
<p>What a wonderful story to tell.</p>

<p>SHE'S only three years old, but Madison Didham made the 602-stair trek to the top of Canwest Place on Sunday to raise money for lung disease.</p>
<p>As the youngest participant in the Lung Association of Manitoba's fourth annual Conquer the Globe: StairClimb for Clean Air event, Madison has already raised more than $1,600 for the cause.</p>
<p>Madison's parents entered her into the fundraiser because "she has been climbing stairs ever since she could walk."</p>
<p>"Grandma Hunny and Grandpa live on the 12th floor of the St. James Towers and Madison always chooses to take the stairs," said Madison's mother, Cari.</p>
<p>"My husband heard about the fundraiser and thought, if she enjoys it so much, why not give it an attempt."</p>
<p>Madison's father Jeff did the climb with her.</p>
<p>"As a family, my daughter and myself can do it together and have fun," said Jeff Didham. "The good she is able to do is something that she may not understand now, but she will as time goes on."</p>
<p>Cari Didham said she and her husband are very blessed to have an active, healthy child, but there are those that are not as fortunate.</p>
<p>"Especially now with the H1N1 that affects the respiratory system, this was a perfect time to make the goal and try to help those with lung disease," said Cari.</p>

</p>
<p>MONTREAL -- If Quebeckers have seen reduced waiting times at flu vaccination centres, they can thank the wonderful world of <span class="companylink">Disney</span>.</p>
<p>Denis Beaudoin, a regional health official, had became obsessed with how to deliver shots to thousands of people without long queues. One night, in the throes of insomnia, he had a eureka moment. He recalled his family visit to <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> World and its popular Fastpass, which allows visitors to get a ticket for a ride at a later time slot.</p>
<p>If it worked for Snow White, why not for a flu shot?</p>
<p>He began instituting the ticket system in the city of Gatineau near Ottawa in late October, at a time when vaccination centres around Montreal were still chaotic scenes of mothers, baby strollers and outraged pensioners standing in lines for as long as seven hours.</p>
<p>Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc visited Gatineau at the time in late October and, impressed, announced the coupon system across the province. A Quebec health official says they're mandatory wherever lines exceed one hour.</p>
<p>Other cities across Canada have turned to wristbands and timed tickets to reduce lineups for vaccines too, though Quebec's system is provincewide and appears to be the only one inspired by the Magic Kingdom.</p>
<p>Lines are still forming at some vaccination centres, where people are queuing up early just to get their coupons. But officials say the system has been effective. At one vaccination centre in Montreal's Plateau Mont Royal district recently, nurses and health workers outnumbered people in line.</p>
<p>“The system is marvellous,” said Johanne Spencer, who'd whisked through her vaccination. “You know what time you're going to have your turn and you know how long you'll have to wait. You don't waste three, four hours in line.”</p>
<p>Montreal adopted the coupon system for all 17 vaccination centres across the city.</p>
<p>“Something had to be done,” said Deborah Bonney, a spokeswoman for the Montreal-region health and social service agency. “At the beginning, we had no idea people were going to line up in the dark of the early morning in the cold. Confronted with the situation, the coupon system seemed to be the best option. It seems to have done the trick.”</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Disney</span> isn't the only corporate inspiration for both Mr. Beaudoin and Mr. Bolduc. Both are avowed fans of the Toyota management model, with its emphasis on just-in-time delivery and efforts at efficiency.</p>
<p>“It's not for nothing that Toyota makes some of the best cars in the world and it's not for nothing that it's so extraordinary to go to <span class="companylink">Disney</span> World,” said Mr. Beaudoin, deputy head of the Gatineau health and social services agency. “They're both basically focused on the customer: how do you ensure the customer has the best product possible in a reasonable time.</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>What other provinces are doing</p>
<p>Health officials in several communities across Canada are turning to coupons or wristbands to shorten lines for flu vaccines. In general, the devices offer the promise of a shot later in the day.</p>
<p>• Toronto health authorities issue either tickets or bracelets for flu-shot appointments, although some people are opting to take a chance and remain in line, a health official said.</p>
<p>• In Vancouver, nurses distribute numbered tickets that essentially reserve a place in line. The tickets don't have specified times for appointments, but staff gauge the approximate time the number will come up.</p>
<p>• Ottawa Public Health distributes bracelets; it also posts the number of available bracelets at individual vaccine centres, in real time, on its website as well as on Twitter. (The city has temporarily closed its vaccination clinics due to an inadequate supply of the H1N1 vaccine).</p>
<p>• Some smaller communities are operating by appointment. In Sault Ste Marie, Ont., for example, a local call centre books appointments for residents at vaccination clinics. Patients call the hotline, make their appointment and turn up at the designated place and time.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu spurs soaring sales of orange juice</b>

<p>GLOBAL FOOD REPORTER</p>
<p>The international wave of panic sparked by the spreading H1N1 influenza has citrus growers in Florida struggling to keep straight faces.</p>
<p>Orange juice, both fresh and frozen, has been flying off supermarket shelves at rates that are unprecedented even for flu season, which normally delivers a small boon to producers of the state's trademark fruit when people begin the annual scramble to stave off sickness by chugging vitamin C.</p>
<p>The addition of H1N1 to the mix has caused that boon to balloon beyond expectations, bailing growers out of what was originally forecast to be a dismal economic year.</p>
<p>“We're seeing probably one of our best seasons in a long time,” said Doug Bournique, executive vice-president of the Indian River Growers' Association, which represents 1,000 citrus growers in Florida.</p>
<p>“The best thing you can ingest to fight off colds and flu – everybody knows it – is vitamin C. … Everybody tells me they're drinking a lot of orange juice and grapefruit juice because of just that issue.”</p>
<p>By his count, H1N1 on its own has pumped up sales by “that extra 10 or 15 per cent in sales we're seeing across the board.” There are numbers to prove it.</p>
<p>Monthly AC Nielsen reports that track orange juice sales in the U.S. are showing steady increases over the past seven months.</p>
<p>That's partly due to a lowering of juice prices this year over last year's, but heightened demand is also a factor, said Bob Norbert, the deputy executive director of the Florida Department of Citrus' research and operations division.</p>
<p>Original estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast a 15-per-cent reduction in Florida's citrus crop for 2009-2010, due largely to the variability of weather and ongoing problems with tree disease in the industry, which injects $9-billion (U.S.) annually into the state economy.</p>
<p>As the flu continues to spread, it is likely the H1N1-related juice boom will continue inflating even though this year's yield produced less juice.</p>
<p>James Courtier, an options analyst with the U.S.-based Liberty Trading Group, has been tracking orange juice futures and said there has been a marked increase over the past two or three months as the flu has intensified.</p>
<p>In fact, orange-juice futures for January jumped 73 per cent so far this year, before pulling back slightly on Friday.</p>
<p>Whether all that juice is actually helping people stay healthy is an open question.</p>
<p>Donald Low, chief microbiologist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, said there is no evidence that OJ will help you fight off H1N1.</p>
<p>“It's a great marketing tool,” Dr. Low said. “It's not going to hurt you. But it's not going to make you feel better.”</p>

<div>TWO-PARENT HOUSEHOLDS / WHO STAYS HOME?</div>
<div>Globe Life</div>
<div id="hd"><b>The new flu symptom: child-care negotiations</b>
</div><div>ERIN ANDERSSEN   </div>
<div>750 words</div><div>16 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>L1</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

<p>OTTAWA -- Forget fevers and sniffles. For working parents across the country, the most stressful flu symptom this fall may be that tense breakfast-table negotiation: Who is going to stay home with the kids? Who is going to wait in line for the vaccine? Who spends the night in emergency? And that unspoken question potentially underlying every answer: Whose job is more important?</p>
<p>“There's a lot of trading off in my office,” says Tami O'Dette, an Ottawa mother of four-year-old twins who works as a technical writer at an engineering firm. When her daughter came down with the flu, she stayed home since her job is more flexible than her husband's. “I'm lucky that in my office I can just shut my laptop, say, ‘Ava has the flu' and take off.”</p>
<p>The H1N1 pandemic, with its school closings and high absenteeism rates, arrives at a time when Canada has more families than ever with two working parents.</p>
<p>It also has highlighted the complications facing parents when kids get sick. Flexible workplaces have made those arrangements easier, but many parents are using up vacation time to stay home or missing pay altogether. For divorced parents, the negotiation can be even more delicate. And while fathers are doing a share of the nursing duties, it's still mainly moms in the role of first response.</p>
<p>“My experience is, from my research, my students, other mothers, when a kid is sick at school they still call mom,” says Andrea O'Reilly, associate professor of women's studies at Toronto's York University.</p>
<p>She suggests that bias still has an impact on the role of mothers in the work force: “If you are away from work, you're seen as not as committed to your job. A year from now, nobody can prove it, but if a position comes available, they might remember the week or two you were away during the swine flu.”</p>
<p>In Kelowna, B.C., Nicole McNichol and her husband run their own businesses, but when their children came down with the flu last week, she juggled her work to manage their care, even into the night.</p>
<p>“That's just sort of how it goes,” she says, pointing out that the flu struck during a busy time for her husband's boat-repair business, while her job as a consultant for a skin-care line allows her to make calls and arrange evening appointments – and handle requests for orange juice and cuddles.</p>
<p>And, she acknowledges, she probably wouldn't be happy leaving her kids so sick. “I'd always be worrying.” As for the late-night rounds, “it just happens because my husband could sleep through an earthquake,” she says with a sigh.</p>
<p>After years of being the first call for her six-year-old son Kenny, Calgary lawyer Johanna Price finds herself in a secondary role after her husband's layoff. Before, “it would have all fallen to me. It was unspoken. It wasn't that he was necessarily asking me to, but I felt compelled to take on more of that role and try to be flexible.”</p>
<p>Her husband, at the time, had a high-level executive position, and, Ms. Price says, she wanted to support him. “For him to take time off from work, that would be perceived as inappropriate, whereas when the mom takes time off from work, it's seen as the normal course.”</p>
<p>Now, she says with a laugh, she has to quell her frustration when her husband abandons the vaccine lineup with Kenny because it's too long. “If it was me, would I have waited in line? Yes. Do I feel guilty that I wasn't there? Yes.”</p>
<p>For two-income families, the bottom line is that no matter which parent stays home, the flu season will take a financial toll – in wages missed or vacation time lost. Ann Whiteaker, a bookkeeper in Victoria with three school-aged children, says any more illness in her family will mean using up holidays or working weekends to make up for lost pay. She and her ex-husband shared the duties initially when their kids began to get sick last month, but eventually, they ended up staying home with Mom. “I had to come back to work and do extra hours to get caught up. … I have no more sick days left.”</p>

<div>TELEVISION / THE CBC'S NEW LOOK</div>
<div>The Globe Review Column</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Dear Canada: Your opinion on the CBC is ‘pathetic'</b>

<p>A few weeks ago our collective attention was drawn to CBC's new look and style for The National and Newsworld – now CBC News Network. We all know what happened. Through this wee column alone, there was an outpouring of dismay.</p>
<p>The new look and stand-up style on The National drew derision, and the apparent emphasis on colour, swirling graphics and itsy-bitsy stories caused many of you, and me, to conclude the CBC had galloped away on another creative misadventure.</p>
<p>Right. Well, last week, my attention was drawn to InsideTheCBC.com which I gather is an “official” CBC blog. There it is reported that at some event to explain the state of things to CBC staff in Vancouver, Richard Stursberg, chap in charge of all TV and radio, dismissed criticism of the new Newsworld and new National format. He called the criticism “pathetic” and claimed it “revolves around whether people are standing or sitting.”</p>
<p>He also said, standing up presumably, and I checked the accuracy of these quotes with CBC: “One thing we should remember is that the papers are owned by our competitors … so I think you can draw your own conclusions about where they are going.”</p>
<p>Well excuse us. No, seriously, excuse us for having an opinion and engaging at all with CBC's adventures in new formats. We should just shut up. And, yes, acknowledge, as I do now, that every Monday, representatives of The Globe and Mail, The Toronto Star and Maclean's meet to determine how we're going to undermine the CBC during the week. The meeting takes place at the Royal York Hotel, 10 a.m., usually. Ask anybody. By the way, the National Post was once part of the meetings but can't afford the cab fare or even the TTC fare these days.</p>
<p>Stursberg can claim that newspapers are biased until he's blue in the face, for all I care. But here's the thing – the CBC's own website was inundated with complaints and criticism from CBC viewers. Are they dismissed as “pathetic?”</p>
<p>Further, the criticism of the shambles that was the first few days of the new National was only superficially focused on “whether people are standing or sitting.” Besides, the stand-around-routine looked awkward, under-rehearsed and it was as plain as a poke in your eye that some reporters were uncomfortable with it.</p>
<p>What really disturbs people about the new format of The National is the emphasis on the shallow and the inconsequential. Information is presented as a news story but it amounts to mere seconds of footage with one- or two-sentence summaries.</p>
<p>Last Thursday night, mere seconds were devoted to the Prime Minister's trip to Asia, mere seconds to Prince Charles in Canada and mere seconds to a story about <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> providing an alibi for somebody. It was a fast, nonsensical list.</p>
<p>Later, there was an item that's emblematic of the new National. Lifestyle, news-you-can-use stuff. Kelly Crowe did a report on products that claim to help prevent being afflicted by H1N1. Fair enough. On the screen was a “need to know” list. It included this: “If claims seem too good to be true, they probably are.” You don't say. Was there a team of researchers and producers on that one? Now, if some CBC exec wants to throw around the word “pathetic,” they could throw it at that sort of alleged reporting.</p>
<p>There was also a report on the new guidelines for Canadian citizenship tests. A very superficial gist was offered and then, inevitable with the new-format National, a “streeter” – people on the street in Ottawa were asked their opinion. Some had absolutely nothing to say but muttered platitudes. There was an absolute absence of any thought about the meaning of the new guidelines. What sort of Canada does it present to new citizens? What can be extrapolated in a cultural sense?</p>
<p>And there's the rub – weeks after the new-format National was launched, the emphasis on the superficial is all too clear. I know that. You know that. But what do we know, really? We're “pathetic.”</p>
<p>Memo to Richard Stursberg – the CBC belongs to all of us and we're all entitled to input without being met by insults and arrogant dismissal.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>Airing tonight</p>
<p>Battle of the Blades (CBC, 8 p.m.) ends with the results show tonight. Razzle-dazzle and drama are promised. Whatever. Not my kind of thing. Battle of the Blades is a cute gimmick but creaky. It represents the Canada of small “c” conservative – past-it NHL players, smiling figure skaters, Ron MacLean's puns, <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> and, possibly Stephen Harper in his sweater.</p>
<p>Gossip Girl (A, 8 p.m., the CW, 9 p.m.) no longer has the sizzling buzz, but it does have devoted followers. Tonight: “Blair tries to impress students at NYU with a private Lady Gaga concert; Serena turns to Nate for support during a difficult situation; Jenny agrees to do a favour for Chuck.” The people really paying close attention to Gossip Girl are those at the Parents Television Council. Last week's “threesome” storyline continues tonight with flashback scenes. The Council says it is “anxious” to see it. Quite so. J.D.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The fairest of an unfair lot; Want to end queue-jumping? Make people pay for vaccines</b>
</div><div>Marni Soupcoff   </div>
<div>National Post</div>

</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccination debate started out as one over whether the government was trying to poison us or save us. It has since morphed into a populist freak-out about the rich and privileged who, it is feared (and in some cases understandably so), have been allowed to jump the queue.</p>
<p>Intellectually I can't get very excited about a hockey player or <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> employee getting his Swine flu jab before me because first of all, I really don't like needles, and secondly, I'm not convinced H1N1 is a great threat. But emotionally, I certainly understand why there's been a rising sense of frustration about the injustice of some people getting preferential treatment.</p>
<p>"Vaccines for the rich!" blares the headline on a blog post on infowars.com,"Wall Street gets H1N1 vaccine bailout while school children told to wait." When you put it that way, it really does make the blood boil. Of course, it's a sensationalized headline (lots of school kids are getting vaccinated and it's not like those who aren't are dropping dead). And this kind of inequity happens all the time in other arenas -- Wall Street gets jewels, new iPods, luxurious condos, theatre tickets, caviar, autographs and many other things before, and to the exclusion of, the majority of school children, and without making headlines. But in a public health emergency (let's pretend for a moment that H1N1 really is that for the sake of argument) the goods at issue -- the vaccines -- are so important there we'd all like to think that they will be distributed in a scrupulously fair and even way based on need. The problem is, of course, that when humans being are involved, the achievement of a perfectly just and dispassionate distribution of anything desirable or important -- be it vaccines or food or hockey tickets -- is impossible. That's why communist party bosses are always far fatter than the proletariat (long after the revolution has passed); and why Canada's "single-tier" health care system really has more layers than a wedding cake. People look after their own interests. It's not evil (at least, not necessarily so). It's just what we humans do.</p>
<p>Ironically, what usually serves as a great equalizer is cash and price tags. I know that's not how people usually think about money. The rich get all the</p>
<p>breaks. The poor are marginalized and powerless. But at least when money's involved, it doesn't matter who you are or who you know (or what party you belong to or what language you speak) -- if you've got cash, you can buy what you need and want.</p>
<p>And no self-interested bureaucrat gets to decide whether you need and want it enough, or whether someone else needs it and wants it more. Instead, whoever needs it and wants it the most will end up being the highest bidder and will take it home.</p>
<p>It's a bit counterintuitive, but really it's because we're unwilling to allow a price tag to be put on the H1N1 vaccine -- because we see it as too important to be left to the vagaries of the market -- that we're seeing such unequal access to it.</p>
<p>Imagine if pharmaceutical companies were free to produce an H1N1 vaccine any way they saw fit and were allowed to charge people what ever they wanted for it. Given such an incentive, the pharmaceutical companies would quickly move from growing the vaccine in hens' eggs (which risk-averse government health agencies favour, but significantly slows down the process) to growing the vaccine in monkey cells, or to other faster methods.</p>
<p>The shortages would be a thing of the past, and no longer would being a celebrity or having an old university roommate who's now a doctor be necessary prerequisites for getting access to the vaccine. Yes, you'd need money to get your hands on the shot. But as imperfect scenarios go, discrimination based on cash -- rather than class or connections or social status or education or blood ties or the ability to pilot a puck around the ice -- is probably the least dangerous inequity there is.</p>
<p>At least then we'd all know where we stood and what we needed to do (save, borrow, budget) to get vaccinated if we wanted to -- and if we valued doing so at the current prices. Government and charities could still choose to dole out doses for free to the impoverished if there was concern that they wanted the vaccine but couldn't afford it. But the pressure would have been relieved from the system with so many others free to buy the vaccine on their own.</p>
<p>Luckily, we still have time before we encounter a real pandemic -- at least in the sense of the word that most people understand intuitively: a great many people dying or becoming seriously ill. Perhaps we should use that time to consider just how much of a favour we're doing ourselves by pretending that objective equity in health care delivery can ever be achieved in a system where people aren't free to express their needs and wants with their buying power.</p>
<p>Markets aren't fair. But they're often fairer than the alternatives.</p>

<p>The easiest way to expose oneself to public shame in Canada these days is to get the H1N1 vaccine without being in a priority group.</p>
<p>It started with people who didn't have medical conditions standing in line at clinics. Now, it seems every day there's a new scandal about the rich or powerful having access that the rest of us don't. Professional athletes, hospital donors, even students in private boarding schools seem to have no trouble getting the shot.</p>
<p>There have indeed been real ethical lapses. The queue-jumpers themselves are in many cases embarrassed, but they didn't do it on their own. They didn't trick doctors and health authorities into giving them the vaccine. If they got the shot, it's because someone in the medical system allowed them to get it. This touches a peculiarly Canadian nerve. In this country, it is an article of faith that access to health care has nothing to do with money or social standing.</p>
<p>There have been enough of these incidents now to suggest that some doctors and officials are making up their own rules on the fly, without looking at the national picture or all the evidence.</p>
<p>The queue-jumping saga should provide Canada with valuable lessons for its next emergency.</p>

<p>"We believe they're being manipulated by the union, or people within the union," Doney said, noting that 35 ambulances were off the road Friday and another 24 on Saturday because paramedics were turning down optional shifts.</p>
<p>"I believe there is one thing we and the union agree on -- clearly the system has problems and needs fixing.</p>
<p>"But to protest at the expense of people and patients' safety is completely wrong."</p>
<p>Union spokesman B.J. Chute said there is no organized attempt to stop ambulance service.</p>
<p>"Paramedics are certainly upset," said Chute, speaking for Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 873, which represents B.C.'s 3,600 paramedics. "The union is not in any place to issue an overtime ban. On the contrary, members are instructed to abide by their collective agreement, WorkSafe B.C., and B.C. legislation."</p>
<p>After a months-long bitter strike, Falcon forced paramedics back to work, citing the H1N1 pandemic as his motivation.</p>
<p>The opposition New Democratic Party believes the move was demanded by Olympic officials worried that the Games in February would not have adequate ambulance coverage.</p>
<p>"VANOC . . . requires definitive confirmation by October 1, 2009, that all required ambulance services will be provided as planned," VANOC director of medical services Dr. Mike Wilkinson wrote in a memo to government.</p>
<p>Quizzed about whether the memo triggered the back-to-work law, Falcon said H1N1 "was the primary motivator here," admitting that "the Olympics is a secondary but important issue. There's no question about it. I won't deny that the Olympics isn't important in this whole calculation."</p>
<p>Doney agrees with Falcon.</p>
<p>"I think [the Olympics] was a factor, but it wasn't the dominant factor," he said. "I have nothing but respect for paramedics, and I hope the professional paramedics will come to the fore." iaustin@theprovince.com</p>

<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>STATEHOOD FACES FIRST TEST AT POLLS</p>
<p>PRISTINA - Kosovo held its first elections on Sunday since declaring independence from Serbia last year, with unemployment, corruption, poor infrastructure and low investment the biggest issues for voters.</p>
<p>The local polls are seen as a key test for Kosovo which wants to establish itself as a fully functioning democracy and gain acceptance from more countries than the 63 that have so far recognized it as an independent state.</p>
<p>"Today we are showing that our country and its citizens have deserved independence, democracy and the European Union perspective," said Kosovo's prime minister, Hashim Thaci.</p>
<p>Analysts say the low turnout, 45 per cent, reflects the disappointment many Kosovars feel in their leaders for failing to improve the economy of one of Europe's poorest countries.</p>
<p>The turnout among Kosovo's Serbian minority was minimal.</p>
<p>SERBIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH HEAD DIES</p>
<p>BELGRADE - The head of the Serbian Orthodox Church during the fall of communism and the Balkan wars, patriarch Pavle, died Sunday in Belgrade, with thousands paying tribute to the 95-year-old religious leader.</p>
<p>A coffin with the body was brought to Belgrade's main cathedral where it was displayed to followers come to bid their final farewells.</p>
<p>MAFIA 'NUMBER TWO' ARRESTED</p>
<p>ROME - Italian police on Sunday captured the number two leader of Sicily's Cosa Nostra Mafia, Domenico Raccuglia, after 15 years on the run, officials said.</p>
<p>Raccuglia, 45, who has been sentenced separately to three life jail terms including for his role in the kidnapping and murder of a teenage boy, was arrested in Sicily's Trapani region, police told ANSA news agency.</p>
<p>"Mimmo" Raccuglia, who was nicknamed "the veterinarian" for his love of animals, was considered one of Italy's 30 most dangerous fugitives, ANSA reported.</p>
<p>At the time of his arrest, he tried to escape from a balcony in the apartment where he was hiding in a suburb of Calatafimi. Police had surrounded the building and caught him.</p>
<p>WOES MOUNTING FOR ITALY'S PM</p>
<p>ROME - Silvio Berlusconi's personal, political and legal problems are mounting, leading the Italian prime minister's media and political allies to speak of a plot against him and a risk of early elections.</p>
<p>"Berlusconi under siege," was the headline in Sunday's edition of Il Giornale, owned by Berlusconi's brother, over an article which promised to "reveal the plot" against him.</p>
<p>The tycoon leader has been under pressure since May when his wife announced she wanted a divorce and a series of sex scandals began to emerge.</p>
<p>But problems have been mounting of late rather than easing, leading many commentators to predict an early end to his 18-month-old government even though his approval ratings remain relatively high and he has an ample parliamentary majority.</p>
<p>PUBLICITY STUNT HORRIFIES MINISTER</p>
<p>PARIS - French Budget Minister Eric Woerth said on Sunday he was horrified by a publicity stunt that attracted huge crowds hoping for a cash handout and led to serious violence when it was cancelled for safety reasons.</p>
<p>Marketing website Mailorama.fr was forced to call off its plan to throw envelopes of cash to passers-by from the top of a bus on Saturday after thousands of people turned up and began spilling over security barriers.</p>
<p>The decision to call off the stunt, which had been heavily promoted beforehand, sparked violent scenes in which shop windows were smashed, at least one car was overturned by hooded youths and photographers and cameramen were attacked.</p>
<p>Police in riot gear were called in to break up the disturbances and about 10 people were arrested.</p>
<p>MAN ARRESTED FOR SENIOR SEX ATTACKS</p>
<p>LONDON British police on Sunday arrested a 52-year-old man in connection with more than 100 sex attacks on elderly women and men dating back to the 1990s, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>A police task force has long been hunting one of Britain's most wanted serial rapists, dubbed the "night stalker," over the attacks and burglaries on the elderly in their homes across southeast London.</p>
<p>Police did not reveal details of the man seized, nor whether he would be charged over the attacks, but detectives investigating the case reportedly described the arrest as "significant."</p>

<p>SALVADOR STORM TOLL RISES TO 192</p>
<p>SAN SALVADOR - Salvadoran authorities raised the death toll from devastating floods and mudslides this week to 192 from 184 as more bodies turned up in storm-ravaged areas of the country. Another 80 people were reported as missing.</p>
<p>Broken down by region, 89 people were killed in central San Vicente department, 64 in San Salvador, 14 in La Paz, 14 in La Libertad and 11 in Cuscatlan, the civil protection agency said.</p>
<p>Another 80 people were reported as still missing from the storms, it added.</p>
<p>Torrential rains last weekend washed away homes, destroyed crops and took out bridges and a large part of the country's system of roads.</p>
<p>El Salvador's President Mauricio Funes ordered the army to begin a major operation to deliver food to communities affected by the disaster.</p>
<p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
<p>YEMENI, SAUDIS LAUNCH NEW STRIKES</p>
<p>KHUBAH - Yemeni and Saudi forces pounded Shiite rebel positions along the border between the two countries on Sunday, witnesses and military officials said.</p>
<p>"Saudi jet fighters resumed their attacks on Saturday night and bombarded rebel hideouts" in the border area, witnesses told AFP. "There was relative calm on Sunday morning but air operations against the border area are continuing."</p>
<p>The Saudi military presence in the Jizan region has been boosted over the past two days, according to an AFP correspondent, who said reinforcements were seen on the route to Khubah, close to the rebel positions.</p>
<p>ACADEMIC'S TRIAL RESUMES TUESDAY</p>
<p>TEHRAN - The next trial hearing of French academic Clotilde Reiss, accused of "collecting information and provoking rioters," will take place in Tehran on Tuesday, the ISNA news agency reported.</p>
<p>The agency said Sunday that the trial in a Revolutionary Court will be attended by "the defendant's lawyer and the prosecutor's representative," but did not clarify whether Reiss herself would be present.</p>
<p>The academic was arrested in the wake of the protests that followed Iran's disputed presidential election in June.</p>
<p>MYSTERY OF MASS POISONING SOLVED</p>
<p>PARIS - Researchers have pinpointed the source of what is probably the worst mass poisoning in history, according to a study published Sunday.</p>
<p>For nearly three decades scientists have struggled to figure out exactly how arsenic was getting into the drinking water of millions of people in rural Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The culprit, says the new study, are tens of thousands of man-made ponds excavated to provide soil for flood protection.</p>
<p>An estimated two million people in Bangladesh suffer from arsenic poisoning, and health experts suspect that the toxic, metal-like element has caused -- and will continue to cause -- many deaths as well.</p>
<p>Symptoms include violent stomach pains and vomiting, diarrhoea, convulsions and cramps.</p>
<p>A large dose can kill outright, while chronic ingestion of small doses has been linked to a large range of cancers.</p>
<p>ASIA</p>
<p>SUSPECTED CAR BOMB KILLS THREE</p>
<p>PESHAWAR, Pakistan - A suspected car bomb killed at least three people on today near a Pakistan air force base close to the northwestern city of Peshawar and the Afghan border, a government official said.</p>
<p>The city has been targeted several times since the army began an offensive against the Taliban in South Waziristan last month and militants stepped up retaliatory attacks. Scores of people have been killed.</p>
<p>"So far, there are three people killed and seven wounded," Sahibzada Anis, the city's administrator, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The attacker apparently targeted a police station outside the Badaber air base on the outskirts.</p>

<p>Alberta Health Services hopes to start vaccinating firefighters, paramedics and police officers against the H1N1 flu this week, although no details are yet in place.</p>
<p>Discussions are set for Monday to decide where and when the shots will be administered. Some first responders might have to go to mass vaccination clinics, while others could get inoculated in smaller clinics in fire halls, ambulance bays or police stations, depending on what resources and health staff are available, said James Finstad, spokesman for Alberta Health Services.</p>
<p>Currently, the H1N1 vaccine is only being given to people at high risk of developing serious complications from the flu, such as pregnant women and people under 65 with chronic health conditions such as diabetes or asthma. Caregivers and household contacts of people who can't be vaccinated, such as babies under six months old or those with suppressed immune systems, can also get their shots.</p>

<p>Beijing --</p>
<p>Increasing global frustration over China's currency waffling threatens to overshadow U.S. President Barack Obama's trade agenda as his first presidential visit to Asia gets under way.</p>
<p>After failing to win an agreement on easing currency controls at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Singapore over the weekend, Mr. Obama will need careful diplomacy in his meetings with Chinese President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao this week. Despite earlier indications that China's central bank was willing to relax the yuan's effective 16-month peg to the U.S. dollar, Mr. Hu carefully avoided any mention of the issue this weekend, instead attacking what he termed “unreasonable” trade restrictions on developing nations.</p>
<p>Underscoring the uncertainty, a final statement from APEC leaders omitted a reference to “market-oriented exchange rates” – included in an earlier draft version – because Chinese and U.S. negotiators could not agree on the wording. Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Chen Jian Sunday backed away from suggestions the central bank had signalled a policy shift on the yuan.</p>
<p>Though China has been under increasing pressure from the U.S. and its Asian neighbours to relax its currency policy, officials there have been loathe to do so for fear of dampening modest signs of recovery in its exports. “Economies around the world are beginning to grow again. And we are on the path to recovery,” Mr. Obama said in remarks to APEC delivered before travelling to Shanghai last night.</p>
<p>“But we cannot return to the same cycles of boom and bust that led to this recession. We cannot follow the same policies that led to such imbalanced growth. If we do, we will continue to drift from crisis to crisis, a failed path that has already had devastating consequences for our citizens, our businesses, and our governments.”</p>
<p>At the same time, China's growing clout as an economic power – it is the world's third-largest economy, on the way to becoming the second and the largest foreign owner of U.S. debt – has shifted the dynamic between the two countries toward one of equality. For instance, Chinese questions about how Washington spending policies will affect the already soaring U.S. deficit and the safety of Chinese investments now must be answered by Washington.</p>
<p>Chinese finance officials now appear to be hitting back against pressure on currency controls. In Beijing, the chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission Sunday blamed low U.S. interest rates and the decline of the dollar for “huge” speculation in foreign exchange trading.</p>
<p>“The continuous depreciation in the dollar, and the U.S. government's indication that, in order to resume growth and maintain public confidence, it basically won't raise interest rates for the coming 12 to 18 months, has led to massive dollar arbitrage speculation,” Liu Mingkang told a finance forum. As a result, he said, this has “seriously affected global asset prices, fuelled speculation in stock and property markets, and created new, real and insurmountable risks to the recovery of the global economy, especially emerging-market economies.”</p>
<p>The tensions have cast doubt on Mr. Obama's hopes for strengthening U.S. trade with China amid accusations of protectionist policies and dumping of goods on both sides.</p>
<p>He has described his China trip as having a “jobs agenda” and called on China to move beyond its current strategy of keeping the yuan low and its exports affordable to ensure that its impressive economic growth – now forecast to hit 8.4 per cent by year's end – continues beyond the present, massive levels of government spending to stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>“Chinese consumers … are ready to consume more. In some ways their consumption has been put on the backburner in the interest of export-led growth. That was an entirely legitimate strategy as they were trying to pull themselves out of very difficult economic times. As they become more confident, I think that they will be more interested in the kind of balanced growth that we think is achievable,” Mr. Obama told Reuters late last week.</p>
<p>U.S. officials estimate 1.6 million American jobs are directly related to exports to Asia, thanks to its modest 9-per-cent share of Asia's trade. An increase to just 10 per cent would create another 250,000 to 300,000 jobs – essential as the U.S. unemployment rate grows, hitting 10.2 per cent last month.</p>
<p>Last month's U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade concluded 11 low-level trade deals including modest concessions from the U.S. on China's poultry exports, and from China on foreign components in wind-power equipment and U.S. pork imports. But beyond that modest progress, larger disputes over Chinese tires and U.S. car parts linger, feeding fears of a wider trade war.</p>
<p>“A lot of people are concerned about a wider trade war between the two countries,” said Jiang Zhaokang, a Beijing-based international customs and trade lawyer who also heads the American Chamber of Commerce in China's trade and customs committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang said, however, that both sides have so far restricted themselves to guarded responses to the other's actions. “Both governments understand the importance of the trade relationship between the two countries,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama's events in China this week will be watched carefully in Canada, where officials are preparing for Prime Minister Stephen Harper's long-awaited first visit to China in early December. On Mr. Harper's agenda will be Chinese bans on imports of Canadian canola and pork products, as well as long-sought approved destination status for Chinese tourists to Canada.</p>
<p>Canadian firms with interests in China have long maintained that Mr. Harper's failure to visit China has affected trade ties. Though politicians have argued against this, Canada has so far failed to have the ban on its pork – imposed over concerns related to the H1N1 flu virus – lifted, while U.S. officials successfully negotiated an end to the ban during trade talks last month.</p>
<p>“Obama has rather carefully sent messages to the leadership that he wants a primordial economic focus in the relationship with China,” said Peter Harder, a former deputy foreign affairs minister and now president of the Canada China Business Council. “I welcome Prime Minister Harper in hopefully not using this visit as a single visit, but as a token toward a long-term commitment to that kind of political relationship with the Chinese leadership.”</p>

<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>559 words</div><div>15 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>W ine is out and bread won't be placed directly on the tongue as new H1N1-friendly rules for Catholic communion take root in this city.</p>
<p>The new communion restrictions are only temporary and were instituted last Sunday by Calgary Bishop Fred Henry as an extra precaution to prevent the spread of the flu virus.</p>
<p>Parishioners are taking the changes without complaint, according to officials at two churches in the city.</p>
<p>Some are even relieved the restrictions are in place, said Father David Meadows of St. Luke Catholic Church in northwest Calgary.</p>
<p>"People seem to be taking it in stride and we told them it's just until this is over," Meadows said. "It wasn't really a big issue."</p>
<p>Henry announced the changes in a letter last week. He instructed that wine not be given during communion (priests still receive it, Meado</p>
<p>ws said) and bread be placed in the hand and not directly on the tongue.</p>
<p>The pre-cautions also include a no-shaking rule during the sign of peace, and emptied holy water fonts.</p>
<p>"At this time, it would only be prudent to elevate our diligence to the next level in trying to stop the rapid spread of the virus," Henry wrote.</p>
<p>"To the faithful of the Diocese of Calgary, I recognize the distress these changes to our sacred liturgy may cause for some," Henry wrote. "Be assured that these are temporary measures only, intended to protect and care for our most vulnerable brothers and sisters."</p>
<p>Meadows said he's been hearing from parishioners concerned about H1N1 before the changes were put in place.</p>
<p>"I think people, I think in some ways, were relieved," he said of the changes.</p>
<p>"I heard no complaints about us doing that. We heard a lot of worry (about H1N1) before these new instructions came out."</p>
<p>He said communion is very important to Catholics, but it's not necessary to receive both the wine and bread, Meadows said, and one or the other is fine.</p>
<p>Father Greg Coupal with St. Mary's Cathedral in southwest Calgary said he's heard of no complaints since the changes to communion were instituted.</p>
<p>"As far as the changes called for by the bishop last week, I would say they just took them in stride," Coupal said of his parishioners.</p>
<p>Many Calgary churches are making sure hand sanitizers are readily available, according to Marg Pollon, the executive director of Bridges of Love Ministry.</p>
<p>During the summer, Pollon facilitated five pandemic information sessions for churches.</p>
<p>"They're looking at how they can safeguard their own congregations and do what they can to do to be ready," said Pollon, who is also the co-ordinator of Regional Faith Community Emergency Preparedness Coalition, which includes government, faith groups and the private sector.</p>
<p>Pollon said she also believes churches can reach out to people who live alone or maybe be shut-ins to offer support and information.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Quebec cartoonists need only wait for politicians to hand them ideas</b>
</div><div>BILL BROWNSTEIN   </div>

<div>991 words</div><div>15 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A14 / BREAK</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>There was much grief and gnashing of teeth in certain quarters when Dubya sashayed out of the White House this year, and when Sarah Palin failed to make it in, with John McCain.</p>
<p>No, not only among the Republicans, silly. But also among editorial cartoonists.</p>
<p>Similarly, there was sadness in these parts - not only Liberals - when Stéphane Dion got the boot as boss. On the other hand, Canadian editorial cartoonists aren't complaining about his replacement, Iggy, as a target. Or, for that matter, Chuckles Harper.</p>
<p>Sure, the world is on the brink of disaster: swine flu, economic crises, global warming, North Korean nuclear testing, Twitter, John Minus Kate Plus 8. But what a grand time our cartoonists are having depicting our planet's demise in their gloriously irreverent drawings.</p>
<p>To many local anglos, there may appear to be only two kinds of compendiums of Canadian editorial cartoons: those by Terry Mosher (Aislin), such as his most recent and 42nd delight, Shenanigans, and those in which Aislin merely contributes, along with colleagues across the country, such as the new Portfoolio 23: The Year's Best Canadian Editorial Cartoons (McArthur & Co., $19.95).</p>
<p>And as Aislin would be the first to mention, this country is a hotbed for editorial cartoonists. This province in particular.</p>
<p>Apart from Aislin, there is his buddy Serge Chapleau, the ever-piquant La Presse cartoonist; Le Droit's Bado, Guy Badeaux; Le Soleil's André-Philippe Côté; Le Devoir's Garnotte, Michel Garneau; Pascal Elie, The Gazette's Sunday and Monday cartoonist; freelancers Fleg (Christian Daigle) and Nemo (Jose Neves); and, of course, the Mirror's Dave Rosen. And for the record, some of the above - Chapleau, Côté, Garnotte, Rosen - have also released their own solo volumes.</p>
<p>But all of the above, as well as representatives from across the land, are included in Portfoolio 23: The Year's Best Canadian Editorial Cartoons. And what a year it has been. Then again, so were the preceding 22 years, documented in previous Portfoolio editions. And, likely, so will be the years to come, until the planet blows up.</p>
<p>Their drawing styles may contrast dramatically, but these Canadian cartoonists all share one thing in common: they take no prisoners when lampooning ludicrous politicos and alleged cultural icons, not to mention the sad state of the universe. It is, of course, to laugh. Which beats the alternative all to hell.</p>
<p>Rosen feels that Quebec produces an inordinate number of acidic cartoonists for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>"For starters, there are an inordinate number of daily, weekly and monthly and whatever newspapers in this province, almost all of which employ cartoonists," says Rosen, who has seven of his creations, in Portfoolio 23, including the back cover. "But more to the point, Quebec politics just makes it so easy for us. And, as an added bonus, Montreal politics have suddenly become juicy. Add to that the seemingly annual federal elections, and there's just never a dull moment here.</p>
<p>"You don't even have to come up with ideas here anymore. The politicians pretty much just hand them to you. And then there's the whole world stage for fodder - be it the U.S. or North Korea. These are golden times for editorial cartoonists."</p>
<p>Rosen, a one-time CBC</p>
<p>Radio traffic reporter, has been doodling since he was a young teen. Not long after, he did editorial cartoons for the defunct local underground paper Logos. His inspirations were famed American cartoonist Robert Crumb as well as Aislin - who also did time at Logos - and Chapleau.</p>
<p>"When I began, I tried doing Aislin's masterly cross-hatching style, but over the years I've simplified my style," notes Rosen, who drew for Hour for 10 years before moving over to the Mirror seven years ago. "I'd say I was more of a minimalist now. Actually, I'm moving closer to the Looney Tunes style - which may be because I'm a big fan of Tex Avery and Chuck Jones.</p>
<p>"But I love doing the Canadian party leaders. They look like Star Trek characters: Harper is Kirk, Iggy is Spock; and Jack and Gilles, the two expendable crewmen on the ship. Canadian politicians are essentially a gift to cartoonists. It's the good-looking politicians like Obama who are a problem. It takes time to get their likeness into caricature."</p>
<p>Rosen faces different challenges than fellow cartoonists who work for the dailies. "It would be a blast to get in there four or five days a week and draw on the topic du jour," says Rosen, who has had a cartoon published in the New York Times. "The difficulty about cartooning for a weekly is to pick a story that will have legs for a week. There's a lot of serious head-banging on Monday morning before my deadline trying to find that story."</p>
<p>But Rosen, like the others, is at least blessed to live in a place where there is no shortage of enduring stories - soaps, sitcoms?</p>
<p>Many readers have inquired about trying to find the works of Gertrude Berg, the subject of my column last Thursday, and the documentary Yoo Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg (now playing at the AMC multiplex). Berg, who has been credited for inventing the sitcom, was the radio and TV pioneer behind The Goldbergs from 1929 to '55.</p>
<p>Thanks to reader Gino Mazzarelli for providing this link to check out, for free, Berg's radio series: www.</p>
<p>freeotrshows.com/otr/g/The_Goldbergs.html. The TV shows will be released for the first time on DVD in the spring.</p>
