</p>
<p>It was pandemonium. People ducked for cover. It was like a grenade had gone off in the movie theatre.</p>
<p>Close: Someone at the back of the house sneezed, and folks as far away as the front of the house recoiled. Some gasped.</p>
<p>Many will suggest this swine-flu frenzy is media-induced. But pity the plight of the poor media: We're damned if we report and we're damned if we don't report. So please, people, get a grip. That's a grip - not a grippe.</p>
<p>It's starting all over again. The germaphobes are back! The germaphobes are back! The swine flu - like C. difficile, the Norwalk virus and SARS before it - has otherwise sensible humans reverting to their inner Howard Hughes.</p>
<p>But at least now we know why humans have been endowed with elbows - other than for dastardly use in the hockey arena. You, too, may have been noticing of late other allegedly evolved primates entering public washrooms and bathroom stalls using the hands-free elbow method. Or, more surreal still, elbow high-fives and shakes. Natch, the two-cheek buss is pretty much verboten these days.</p>
<p>In the same multiplex where that simple sneeze created such anxiety among patrons, the swine-flu hysteria took on even more hysterical proportions in the lavatory.</p>
<p>Forget the elbow brigade. There was a fellow singing Happy Birthday, seemingly to himself, while washing his hands. This inquiring mind wanted to know if it was the gentleman's birthday. Oh, no, he responded: He had just seen a report on CNN that said to ensure one washed one's hands properly, one had to sing Happy Birthday - not once, but twice - to oneself. Or for at least 30 seconds.</p>
<p>A real-life physician actually counselled people to sing Happy Birthday twice? No, the singer said, it was an expert in the field of personal sanitation.</p>
<p>Ah. Fair enough. But what was the warbler going to do after turning off the germ-</p>
<p>infested faucet with one of his washed hands? He then began to utter an obscenity that could only come to the lips of an exasperated germaphobe who had just spent the last few minutes lathering and washing his hands for nothing. He grabbed some paper towels from the dispenser, opened the faucet with one towel, then pressed down on the soap dispenser with it, lathered, washed (but did not sing Happy Birthday twice this time), closed the faucet with the paper towel and dried his hands with another paper towel.</p>
<p>Swell. But just as he was ready to chuck the paper towels into the garbage, I figured it would be only considerate to inform him of the obstacle that lay ahead of him: the germ-infested washroom-door handle. He thanked me, then mentioned that he prefers the multiplexes without washroom doors and with sensor-equipped faucets that turn on simply by placing one's hands underneath the tap.</p>
<p>According to usually reliable sources, though, the bizarro scene in the men's washroom positively pales to that which sometimes plays itself out in the women's washroom. Apparently, there are women who display the dexterity of medal-winning gymnasts in avoiding close contact with certain lavatory facilities. Which is kind of funny, after reading a study suggesting that toilets are often cleaner than computer keyboards, cellphones and kitchen counters.</p>
<p>By the by, best to have paper towels handy if you plan on pressing buttons in an elevator or holding on to handrails on the escalator. Or for opening any doors, for that matter.</p>
<p>And, to be on the safe side, best not to lean back too far and have your head touch the back of your theatre or airplane or bus seat. And watch out for that gas pump at your friendly service station. Cuz you never know.</p>
<p>And let's not even talk about our cash. There have been plenty of reports that paper currency is covered with oodles of bacteria and gunk you don't want to know about, not to mention traces of drugs (some illicit) you may want to know about.</p>
<p>All of which is enough to drive one to much drink. But don't be sticking your digits into that bowl of beer nuts on the bar, because who knows whose germ-infested digits had been mining there previously.</p>
<p>Really, it's a wonder humankind has made it this far. Astonishing to think that back in the bad old days - when most of us weren't packing Purell - some of us rolled around in the mud with abandon, touched other humans and actually lived to tell of our outrageous adventures.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Employers must be ready for a health crisis; 'Unsafe' workplace could lead to employee lawsuit</b>
</div><div>Howard Levitt   </div>
<div>The Financial Post</div>

</p>
<p>Whatever nomenclature is used -- "swine flu" or H1N1 influenza A -- the fear of its spread is discombobulating.</p>
<p>Already struggling with a sick economy, employers now must countenance a new pandemic with additional deadly financial and reputational liability.</p>
<p>Employers should now audit their readiness for crisis.</p>
<p>The courts require employers to provide a safe workplace.</p>
<p>If there is any hint that an employee may be a carrier and that employee is not immediately forbidden to attend work , the damages could be incalculable. A class action against such an employer by infected employees, suppliers and customers could decimate the strongest balance sheet. Apart from a lawsuit, imagine the impact of a news report on the breakout of swine flu on, say, a retail chain's business? Employers should implement policies relating to infectious diseases. Those policies must prohibit employees with any symptoms from attending the workplace and require them to seek immediate medical attention.</p>
<p>A notice should be circulated delineating the disease's symptoms and requiring any employees experiencing them to self-report. An employee who fails to comply should be disciplined.</p>
<p>The employee should then be interviewed (by telephone or e-mail) as to who they encountered in the company during the preceding few days. Those employees, in turn, should be sent home and required to be tested immediately.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the investigation, to the extent there is a conflict, the rights of your remaining employees to a safe workplace supersede the right of the ill employee to confidentiality.</p>
<p>Some employers have voluntarily continued paying employees to remain at home if their disability benefit policies do not cover their wages, which it will not if the imposed absence is precautionary.</p>
<p>Other companies have prophylactically not permitted any employee who has visited Mexico from entering the workplace until the incubation period of the disease elapses. In such circumstances, it is reasonable to provide additional work after those few days so they suffer no loss of income. Ensuring their income is kept whole not only reflects legal obligations in most circumstances but also encourages sick employees to remain home rather than risk an outbreak.</p>
<p>While it prevents liability, the concomitant absenteeism from this approach can also be debilitating. You should have employees trained to fill key positions to protect against this eventuality.</p>
<p>Employers should also be aware of the following: z Employees are generally entitled to take unpaid leave if they are sick, must care for sick family members or are quarantined. Unless there is a specific short-term disability benefit policy that covers their particular situation, there is no legal obligation to pay employees during such a leave. Benefits, however, must be continued and employees' jobs protected; z If a state of emergency is declared, employees unable to work as a result are generally entitled to an unpaid leave of absence until the emergency is lifted; z Employers also have a duty to accommodate. This means that if employees are able to work but must be absent from the workplace, permit them to work from home if that is practicable; z Unaffected employees can be required to work overtime without consent during such an emergency.</p>
<p>But beware. Employees may, opportunistically or irrationally, use the professed fear of contagion as an excuse not to work. Do not tolerate that. Employees cannot refuse to work if their workplace is certified safe by government inspectors.</p>

</p>
<p>Egypt began slaughtering its roughly 300,000 pigs as a precautionary measure against the spread of swine flu even though no cases have been reported in either humans or animals in that country. Underlying religious reasons led to this decision, but the policy is still considered by many to be extreme.</p>
<p>At least 20 countries, from China to Russia to Ukraine, have set bans on all pork product imports. Even Canada has seen its share of panicky assessments. Pork inspections have been increased in an attempt to ease any concerns consumers may have in light of the global influenza A/H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>And while the headlines this week are full of news that a herd in Alberta seems to have contracted the flu, there is still no evidence that swine flu can be transmitted through eating meat from infected animals. None.</p>
<p>In the meantime, hog futures are down and the hog industry is losing millions.</p>
<p>From an epidemiological standpoint, the menace is real. But, when it comes to food safety, the "swine flu" story is really nothing more than a sign of the times. All around the world, panic occasioned by outbreaks of the influenza A/H1N1 virus is incommensurate with the risks of contracting it by eating pork. Public officials are making unfounded decisions based on trivial information at best.</p>
<p>Many elements have triggered this phenomenon to occur. The obvious culprits, for lack of a better term, are the media, but before we point too many fingers, there is a lot more going on than merely fear-driven reporting.</p>
<p>Many criticize the media for the insufficient information and/or misinformation with which they bombard the general population in times of crisis. One should understand that misapprehension of risk by media and news audiences is not exclusively responsible for disproportionate fear or panic, but panic is more likely to occur when a threat receives substantial media coverage.</p>
<p>However, currently in Canada, no public authority can play a more effective role than the media in times of public health crisis. Media can operate virtually in real time these days, whereas public authorities must painstakingly react to incidents. Unlike the media, from whom the public is willing to accept a certain degree of error and backtracking, public health authorities simply cannot prematurely release information that could have so devastating an effect as to, for example, prompt the unnecessary slaughter of hundreds of thousands of perfectly safe and healthy livestock.</p>
<p>What has been interesting, at least in the Canadian media, is the frequent repetition that pork is safe to eat. And yet, pork futures are dropping and healthy pigs are being slaughtered in unaffected parts of the world as a "precautionary measure."</p>
<p>Why this is so may, in fact, have less to do with real panic over the epidemic and more to do with simply the way that food trades work.</p>
<p>Considering food trades, borders are usually only selectively opened. Borders serve important roles in modern economies. They safeguard the sovereignty of nations, impose economic protectionism, and assure the screening out of undesirable products. Regrettably, embargoes and restrictions occur almost on a daily basis for all sorts of reasons, justified or not. H1N1 is the latest excuse some countries are using.</p>
<p>It is, in fact, just part and parcel of the normal trading process.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, these measures foster market fear, which leads to unwise behaviour. Pork is the cheapest protein available and many developing countries depend on its accessibility and affordability to feed their populations. Decisions to restrict pork imports will have a devastating impact on food retailers, the transportation sector, restaurants, and most importantly, consumers. Economic multiplier effects, coupled with public panic concerning the infectivity of the flu in people, may also create a pervasive atmosphere of fear and pessimism that could aggravate the current economic downturn felt in the global economy.</p>
<p>What really triggered this public health panic was simply the fact that the public is now more prone to accept risk prevention measures than ever before, especially in matters involving food. BSE, foot and mouth, major salmonella, listeria and E. coli outbreaks have forever altered risk perceptions of consumers worldwide. Even the succession of less serious food recalls and food-related nuisances have taken their toll on the world population, and public authorities know this.</p>
<p>It is difficult to blame anyone, therefore, for the hog industry's woes. The media, the public, and the food trades are all inclined to respond aggressively and perhaps prematurely to such events. The baseless correlation between the current pandemic and the pork meat simply exists in people's minds, and it may be too late to avert major losses. Chicken farmers in some parts of the world had to face the same problem a few years back with the avian flu.</p>
<p>Media do have a role to play in food crises, but global events related to food are inherently fluid and the message should constantly change. The disconnect between pork and influenza A/H1N1 should become evident in a relatively short time, as the epidemic itself seems to be mellowing.</p>
<p>Whether such revelation will occur in time to prevent serious damage to agriculture sectors worldwide remains to be seen.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>So much for swine flu; Since the first alarming reports of an outbreak in Mexico, nearly all the news about H1N1 has been good -- although it hasn't been reported that way</b>
</div><div>Richard Schabas   </div>
<div>Citizen Special</div>
<div>1073 words</div><div>6 May 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>The outbreak of H1N1 influenza in Mexico has rekindled concerns about a global influenza pandemic. The response has been all too predictable. The World Health Organization has raised the level of pandemic alert and announced that "all of humanity" is under threat. The Public Health Agency of Canada has advised people not to travel to Mexico. And with a (mild) case appearing in Ottawa yesterday, the media are once again feasting on the story.</p>
<p>The facts, however, are more prosaic. Admittedly, when first reported two weeks ago, the events in Mexico were quite alarming. It seemed a new influenza virus was causing serious disease, particularly in young people. This is precisely the scenario we would expect with the beginning of a new pandemic.</p>
<p>Since then, however, almost all the news has been good news, even if it hasn't been presented that way. The most important events have been the ones that haven't happened. It's not entirely clear exactly what is going on in Mexico, but one thing is certain: H1N1 is not behaving like a new pandemic strain.</p>
<p>We now know that the first cases of H1N1 date from early March. This should put Mexico at or even past the peak of its first wave of infection. According to standard pandemic models, Mexico should be seeing about 1,000 deaths each day. Obviously, this is not happening -- not even remotely close. The illness caused by this virus seems to be very mild. And the virus itself may not be so "new" after all.</p>
<p>Some tourists returning from Mexico have brought the virus back with them to Canada and elsewhere. This is hardly surprising. What is more important is that the virus is showing no ability to transmit efficiently here, at least at this time of year. The WHO's notion that the disease is "spreading" every time a visitor brings it to a new country is misleading.</p>
<p>The story is not over yet. We need better epidemiology from Mexico and continued surveillance here. But, overall, the news is now very encouraging. While predictions about the future are inherently hazardous, two scenarios seem most plausible. The virus may die out completely because it is just not quite infectious enough to survive in human populations. Alternatively, it may become established as our dominant seasonal strain. This really shouldn't worry us, however, because the disease is so mild.</p>
<p>So why isn't this message getting out? The sad truth is that there are strong vested interests flourishing from the fear of pandemics. Over the past five years, pandemic planning has mushroomed at all levels of government. Public health agencies have received substantial additional funding for pandemic preparations. Some professionals are building careers as pandemic experts. Good news about pandemics is simply not welcome.</p>
<p>Now is a good time to re-examine the underlying premises of these pandemic fears.</p>
<p>Influenza is an important infectious disease. It regularly kills more Canadians than any other infectious disease. Influenza pandemics do happen -- triggered by the appearance of new strains for which we have no immunity -- but many of our fears are based on misconceptions.</p>
<p>We should dispel the idea that an influenza pandemic necessarily means a catastrophe. The last two pandemics -- the 1957 "Asian" flu and the 1968 "Hong Kong" flu -- were not very different from seasonal influenza except that more people were ill. The 1918 influenza pandemic was worse, but much of the information about it is very sketchy. More to the point, a lot has changed since 1918. We have vaccines, antiviral drugs, antibiotics (most influenza deaths are from secondary bacterial pneumonia), intensive care units and, most importantly, far better general health. Even a 1918-style pandemic should not be a cause for undue alarm.</p>
<p>We should also discard the perception that an influenza pandemic is an emergency. Pandemics unfold on a time-scale of weeks to months; not hours to days. A pandemic can't be "contained," only responded to. In other words, public health authorities should learn to take a little more time to gather and analyse information before raising pandemic alerts or launching pandemic plans.</p>
<p>We need to understand that influenza viruses are not going to suddenly change and become more virulent. This open-ended threat -- usually couched with the term "mutation" -- is a theoretical possibility with any infectious disease. In practical terms, however, it is so rare that it doesn't merit serious consideration. It's the stuff of science fiction.</p>
<p>Once we correct our misconceptions, an influenza pandemic loses much of its terror. It is something we need to be prepared for -- and generally are prepared for -- but not something we should lie awake at night worrying about.</p>
<p>What lessons should we draw from this latest false alarm?</p>
<p>First, we need more and better information before reacting. The Mexican situation looked alarming at first. A little digging revealed a very different and more reassuring picture. There is no point in acting in haste.</p>
<p>Second, public health needs to stick to its principles, regardless of public and political pressures. Canada protested strongly when it was the subject of a WHO travel advisory during the 2003 SARS outbreak. We argued, correctly, that these advisories accomplish nothing except to spread fear and damage the economy of the country targeted. So why did Canada rush to issue a travel advisory on Mexico? It was irrational and unfair. Let's not make that mistake again.</p>
<p>Third, the media must be more critical. How many pandemic false alarms do we need (remember "bird flu" -- the last great threat) before reporters start asking tough questions? How many times do the voices of catastrophe need to be wrong before we doubt their message?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>U.S. reverses course on school closures; Parents urged to keep sick kids at home for week</b>
</div><div>Thomas H. Maugh II and Tracy Wilkinson   </div>
<div>The Los Angeles Times</div>
<div>861 words</div><div>6 May 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Encouraged by the mildness of H1N1 flu infections so far, United States health officials on Tuesday said they would no longer encourage the closure of schools with confirmed cases of the disease.</p>
<p>Instead, they urged parents of children exhibiting symptoms of influenza to keep them home for at least a week.</p>
<p>As for the government's schools action, it does not represent a major shift in policy, but rather a recognition that the virus is not proving to be especially threatening.</p>
<p>"This is a more mild version of the disease than originally feared," said Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. "The lethality seems to be lower."</p>
<p>It was only a week ago that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that schools with at least one confirmed case of H1N1 close for as long as 14 days. About 750 schools around the country have done so, but that represents just over one-half of one per cent of all U.S. schools.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the CDC, said the widespread closings had been a hardship for parents, many of whom did not have adequate sick leave to care for their children. "The downsides of school closure begin to outweigh the benefits," he said.</p>
<p>As lab technicians worldwide continued to plow through the backlog of samples to be tested, the number of new confirmed cases continued to rise, reaching 511 in the United States as of Tuesday afternoon and more than 1,500 worldwide.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, authorities in Mexico said the flu outbreak there had deeply damaged the economy.</p>
<p>The epidemic has cost Mexico an estimated $2.4 billion, Finance Minister Agustin Carstens said during a morning briefing.</p>
<p>However, Carstens expressed optimism for a rapid recovery because no fundamental infrastructure had been destroyed and because stimulus spending could easily revive languishing businesses.</p>
<p>The government said a planned $2 billion stimulus package to revive the economy would include temporary tax breaks, discounted social security payments and a $40-million promotional fund for the tourism and aviation sectors, which have been hit hard by canceled flights and a precipitous drop in visitors to Mexico.</p>
<p>Carstens said Mexico's goal would be to "rebuild confidence" in the country.</p>
<p>Also Tuesday, Mexican Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova said the total number of confirmed cases in that country had reached 866. Of 140 deaths believed to be linked to the new flu strain, 26 had been confirmed by Mexico as having been caused by the virus, and 37 cases were awaiting testing, he said. The CDC said Friday that it had confirmed H1N1 in an additional 86 deaths in Mexico, bringing the country's total to 112.</p>
<p>Some deaths will never be confirmed one way or another, though, Cordova said. He did not give an explanation, but other Mexican health officials said this is because the bodies were buried without samples having been taken.</p>
<p>Mexico was slowly starting to emerge from its disease-induced shutdown on Tuesday after President Felipe Calderon announced that schools would begin to reopen by the end of the week. Restaurants can reopen today, and other public gathering places, such as museums, will be allowed to resume their activities on Thursday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, proprietors were cleaning restaurants and cafes, and teams of government workers were disinfecting schoolrooms, bus railings and subway ticket dispensers throughout Mexico City and the rest of the nation.</p>
<p>Calderon presided over a subdued Cinco de Mayo celebration in the Mexican city of Puebla. The holiday, which in Mexico is mainly observed in Puebla, commemorates the defeat of Napoleon's invading troops by the Mexican army on May 5, 1862. Speaking in epic terms, Calderon compared that victory to Mexico's fight today against the flu.</p>
<p>"Today, almost a century and a half later ... Mexico faces a new threat; this time, a very different, uncommon threat -- the appearance and spread of an epidemic that put the lives and health of Mexican families at risk. Undoubtedly, this has represented a challenge of unknown magnitude," Calderon said, adding that he believed his government responded quickly and effectively.</p>
<p>Speaking at the World Health Organization's daily news conference in Geneva, Assistant Director-General Dr. Keiji Fukuda said public health monitors had been looking without success for signs of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus in Europe or elsewhere.</p>
<p>"We do not feel that we are seeing that right now," he said.</p>
<p>Such transmission outside North America would be the primary criterion for raising the infectious-disease alert level for this outbreak to Phase 6, its highest level, so such a change does not appear to be imminent.</p>

<p>An Ottawa man who recently returned from Mexico has become the first confirmed case of Mexican swine flu infection in the city.</p>
<p>The man had travelled to Mexico last week and returned home with flu symptoms, said Dr. Isra Levy, the city's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Within hours, the man had sought medical attention at an unspecified "ambulatory care" facility, where he was assessed by infectious disease specialists, found to be stable and discharged, said Levy.</p>
<p>The man's symptoms were so mild that he did not need active medical treatment, said Levy. Rather, he was told to go home, manage the illness like any other flu and avoid contact with other people.</p>
<p>"He was given advice about self-management -- uses of fluids and symptomatic treatment," said Levy. "He did not need treatment."</p>
<p>The man had no known underlying illnesses that would have made him more susceptible to the novel H1N1 virus, said Levy.</p>
<p>Levy added that the lone Ottawa case of human swine flu so far followed the pattern of the vast majority of cases in Mexico, which have been "clinically mild."</p>
<p>Even so, public health officials were monitoring those in the man's immediate household, and so far, no signs of infection had appeared, Levy said.</p>
<p>Levy would not disclose the man's age, saying only that he fit the profile of other Ontarians who had been infected, all of whom were under 50.</p>
<p>As part of the city's pandemic response plan, area hospitals and paramedics have been taking extra precautions by screening patients for the human swine flu. Patients who call 911, go to a doctor's office or show up at a hospital emergency room complaining of flu symptoms -- cough, cold, aches and fever -- are asked about their travel history within the past week and about anyone they have been in contact with who may have travelled within the same period.</p>
<p>Those who fit the criteria are immediately isolated, jumpstarting infection-control measures that ensure paramedics, nurses and doctors who treat such patients use gowns, gloves, respirators and face shields to protect themselves.</p>
<p>The patients are then tested for the swine flu virus. Each suspected case is reported to Ottawa Public Health, which oversees the city's pandemic response.</p>
<p>Tony DiMonte, chief of Ottawa Paramedic Services, said the city had not experienced an increase in 911 calls since the start of the outbreak.</p>
<p>Levy said public health officials had no plans to ramp up their pandemic response as a result of the lone Ottawa case.</p>
<p>The city's first case of the human swine flu is one of five new cases that have been confirmed in Ontario. That brings the provincial total to 36.</p>
<p>Of the confirmed cases, 27 have been in the Greater Toronto Area, with four in Windsor and one each in Ottawa, Oxford County, Simcoe Muskoka District and Halton. All cases have been considered mild and those affected are recovering at home.</p>
<p>The Ontario cases involve 13 men and 23 women ranging in age from four to 50.</p>
<p>Typically, public health officials track other common flu strains by monitoring seasonal outbreaks in hospitals and nursing homes because patients in those facilities suffer from underlying illnesses that put them at higher risk of complications, Levy said.</p>
<p>In 2007-08, for example, Ottawa had nearly 600 cases of flu from 43 outbreaks in nursing homes and hospitals. Of those cases, 50 led to hospital admissions, and 24 people died from flu-related complications.</p>
<p>In contrast, the flu season has been relatively mild this year with eight outbreaks causing 54 known cases and one flu-related death, Levy said.</p>
<p>While the human swine flu is similar to all influenza strains in that it sickens people to varying degrees, it's not yet known whether this novel strain of the H1N1 virus could become more virulent.</p>
<p>"We worry that the virus can evolve and adapt quickly," Levy said. "This sets the stage, then, for a fairly high degree of uncertainty."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Quick Facts About Human Swine Flu</p>
<p>Symptoms: Fever, headache, chills, severe fatigue, lack of appetite, cough and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may occur in adults as well as children. In more severe cases, or in people with chronic conditions, complications such as shortness of breath and pneumonia could develop.</p>
<p>What to do: People returning from Mexico who have symptoms of respiratory illness should limit their contact with others, contact their health-care provider or call Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.

<p>Reduce risk by: Washing your hands well and frequently; coughing and sneezing into your sleeve instead of your hands; staying home when you are sick.</p>

</div><div>Andrew Mayeda   </div>

</p>
<p>The Harper government is seeking clarification from China on why 22 Canadian university students have been quarantined in that country, as well as why Canadian consular officials have been granted only limited access to the students.</p>
<p>The government said Tuesday Canada's embassy in China would send a diplomatic note to China's Foreign Ministry expressing "deep concern" that Canadian officials had been denied full access to the students, said a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon.</p>
<p>"We are seriously concerned ... as to why they were quarantined, because there doesn't seem to be any reason at this stage," said Deepak Obhrai, Cannon's parliamentary secretary.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization on Tuesday confirmed 405 new cases and four new deaths from the H1N1 swine flu, raising the global total to 1,490 cases and 31 deaths.</p>
<p>A Texas woman is the first U.S. resident to die from swine flu.</p>
<p>The Texas Department of State Health Services said the woman, who had "chronic underlying health conditions," died in Cameron County, near the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Canada's public health agency confirmed 25 new cases of swine flu across the country Tuesday, bringing the national total to 165. Ten new cases were confirmed in Nova Scotia, one in Quebec, five in Ontario, seven in British Columbia and two in Alberta.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the search continues for an explanation why a young Edmonton-area girl is the only patient in Canada with a severe case of swine flu. Dr. André Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, announced Tuesday the girl was still in stable condition and "recovering well."</p>
<p>Corriveau speculated that pre-existing conditions such as asthma or heart problems could lead to hospitalization if combined with the flu virus. Authorities are also trying to determine where and how the girl was infected, as there is no obvious connection to Mexico, where the outbreak originated.</p>
<p>The Canadian students have been sequestered in China since last Saturday, when they were immediately separated from other airline passengers on arrival in Changchun.</p>
<p>They are being quarantined in a hotel in the city in northeastern China.</p>
<p>The students, who are from the Université de Montréal, were supposed to spend 10 weeks doing an intensive Mandarin language course at a university in Changchun.</p>
<p>A Canadian consular official travelled to Changchun to meet the students Tuesday, but was given only limited access. One of the quarantined students, Montrealer Martin Leroy Deslauriers, said the Canadian official was only allowed by Chinese authorities to meet the students for a few minutes.</p>
<p>A senior official at WHO said Tuesday that quarantine measures might be necessary under certain circumstances, such as when an outbreak was at an early stage, or when there were concerns that quarantined individuals had been exposed to infection.</p>
<p>"This is something which is up to individual countries, analysing their situation. In some instances, quarantine may be a reasonable control measure," said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, WHO's assistant director general of health security and environment.</p>
<p>He said WHO had sought clarification from countries that had imposed quarantine measures, but he would not comment on measures taken by any single country.</p>
<p>The federal government also has no plans at the moment to repatriate the quarantined Canadians.</p>
<p>A Mexican plane arrived in China on Tuesday to bring home 43 Mexicans who had also been quarantined by Chinese authorities. Obhrai said the government would await China's response before deciding on further steps. Some of the quarantined students might wish to stay in China after they are released, he added.</p>
<p>Obhrai said consular officials had spoken on the phone with the students, and believe they were being treated well.</p>
<p>A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry defended the quarantine, saying it was in line with international and domestic law, and the students had agreed to the quarantine, reported Xinhua News, China's state news agency.</p>
<p>The Harper government also continued its efforts to defend Canada's pork industry after several countries, including China, banned imports of Canadian pork meat.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said Tuesday he had spoken with China's ambassador to Canada about the matter.</p>
<p>"As of today, he is making our plea back to Beijing to make sure that they understand the sound science and get back to dealing with good, top quality Canadian pork."</p>
<p>International Trade Minister Stockwell Day also said the Canadian government would pursue the issue through a dispute settlement mechanism, if required.</p>
<p>"There's no scientific basis for countries to ban this product, the United Nations agencies have asked countries not to ban this project, and we're in communication with the countries to have them reverse their opinion," Day said in Prague.</p>
<p>Asked if the issue might end up with the World Trade Organization, Day said, "We will use a WTO challenge if we have to."</p>
<p>Day also said he had talked to his Chinese counterpart and "he was very open to listen to what I had to say."</p>
<p>However, Liberal international trade critic Scott Brison said the government no longer had any "influence" with China because of the Conservatives' past criticism of Beijing.</p>
<p>China and other countries banned the import of Canadian pork meat after pigs on an Alberta hog farm caught the swine flu, the first case worldwide in which the new strain jumped from humans back to pigs.</p>

<p>Canadian government officials announced Wednesday that they had completed the first genetic sequencing of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Plummer, the head of the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg where the sequencing was done said his team has worked around the clock for the past week to accomplish the world first.</p>
<p>Dr. Plummer said the genetic code of the virus found in Nova Scotia and Ontario was not significantly different to the virus samples from Mexico. That means that the genetic make-up of the virus does not explain the differences in severity between Canadian and Mexican cases, he told a news conference.</p>
<p>The vice-president of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency spoke at the same press conference, reassuring Canadians that pork and pork products are safe for consumption.</p>
<p>"In Canada we do not slaughter sick animals for food," Dr. Brian Evans told a press conference.</p>
<p>"We do not process dead animals for food so the guidelines and concerns that have been brought forward by the WHO are in fact addressed by our meat inspection program in Canada.”</p>
<p>Dr. Evans said there are no plans at this time to cull a herd of pigs that was infected by the virus in Alberta. And, when they have recovered and are healthy, they could be slaughtered and butchered for meat.</p>
<p>Mark Taylor, who raises pigs and other livestock at Ravenwood Ranch near Caroline, Alta., said the WHO is unnecessarily raising alarm bells by suggesting the flu virus can be found in meat. Sick animals do not make it to slaughter or to grocery store shelves, he said.</p>
<p>"I hope people can get over this and realize that pork is safe," Mr. Taylor added, "...I believe what CFIA and Alberta Pork are taking the right measures telling people the meat is safe."</p>

<p>"The recent H1N1 influenza virus outbreak is hitting the psyche of the travelling public hard,'' chief executive Sean Durfy said on a conference call with analysts yesterday.</p>
<p>"However, in the past few days, we've actually seen booking velocities come back to normal levels that we've been experiencing in the past couple of months, which is a good sign.''</p>
<p>Durfy cautioned that delayed bookings will affect the airline's revenue per available seat mile, but he said it's hard to predict how severe the hit will be.</p>
<p>The Calgary-based company halted flights to Mexico, where the virus first came to attention last month.</p>
<p>Most cases outside Mexico have been described as mild, but the precautions and warnings surrounding the outbreak have devastated the Mexican tourism industry.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu impact is "perhaps a little bit in the rear-view mirror now,'' said David Newman, an analyst with National Bank Financial.</p>
<p>Air traffic bounced back quite quickly after major global events such as the 9-11 terrorist attacks and the 2003 SARS outbreak -- and the flu should be no different, he said.</p>
<p>"You'd be very surprised on how resilient traffic is, economy aside, in terms of recovery,'' Newman said.</p>
<p>"I'm sure it will have some impact, but not a lasting impact.''</p>
<p>On the conference call, Durfy warned that the next few months will be tough for the airline, which reported a 29 per cent drop in first-quarter profit yesterday on sluggish demand.</p>
<p>"Air travel is a more scrutinized expenditure in a recessionary time and we are seeing more conservative spending from our guests,'' he said.</p>
<p>"However, we do believe this is a short-term pain over the next couple of quarters, and we will recover stronger than we have ever been.''</p>
<p>But with no real signs of economic recovery on the horizon, WestJet is trimming its full-year capacity growth to three per cent from its earlier five per cent target.</p>
<p>WestJet said its profit fell from $52.5 million or 40 cents per share in the first three months of 2008 to $37.4 million or 29 cents per share for this year's first quarter.</p>
<p>That was better than the 26 cents per share expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p>First-quarter revenue fell from $599.3 million to $579.3 million, as the airline was affected by lower demand, competitive pricing and the Easter holiday falling in the second quarter instead of the first.</p>
<p>WestJet stock gained 6.5 per cent to $13.29 in afternoon trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Newman said called it "not a bad quarter.''</p>
<p>"I think they're managing everything quite well in a very tough economic environment. They're managing their capacity well. They're obviously reining in their growth a little bit and doing it in a very thoughtful manner.''</p>
<p>WestJet said its load factor for April was 81.2 per cent, down from 82.5 per cent of its seats filled during the same quarter a year ago.</p>
<p>On the call, Durfy played down concerns over negotiations with the airline's pilots, saying relations with the 950-member WestJet Pilots Association have "never been stronger.''</p>
<p>"We are right now in the middle of our interest-based bargaining with our pilots, so I won't be disclosing anything we're discussing with our pilot group because right now that's an internal matter between the pilots and the corporation,'' he told analysts.</p>

</p>
<p>WASHINGTON</p>
<p>Swine flu is in the air, but the bug to watch out for is the germ of fear.</p>
<p>The school year was coming to a close, and U.S. federal health officials, having convinced the president that swine flu was likely to infect huge numbers of people in just a few months, were racing to make a good vaccine for children.</p>
<p>So in May of 1976, doctors at Children's National Medical Center turned to kids they knew best. The president of the hospital's board had his kids at Beauvoir, the private elementary school on the grounds of the National Cathedral. The principal, Frances Borders, agreed to have her students participate.</p>
<p>Twenty-four Beauvoir students were inoculated, along with 50 children of hospital employees and 43 kids enrolled in the hospital's comprehensive care program.</p>
<p>Lorin Spangler Young was one of the Beauvoir kids who got the shot. She was six. I found her last week in Fort Collins, Colo., where she teaches in an elementary school. Young remembers talking to her mother about whether to get the shot: "She gave me the option, and I chose to do it.'' She recalls going to school that day: "I stifled the tears and walked into the library.'' She remembers the shot itself: It hurt.</p>
<p>But she had no idea that she had participated in an experiment until I told her. "I thought it was a regular influenza shot,'' she says. She says her mother doesn't recall that fact, either.</p>
<p>The families that participated in the test likely knew nothing about the debate among doctors over whether children needed to be inoculated, especially since early evidence was that that year's strain of swine flu had only a minor effect on kids.</p>
<p>The permission form parents signed noted the possibility that the vaccine could cause an allergic reaction, but there was no mention of paralysis. Seven months after the experiment, the District of Columbia hurriedly closed its vaccine centres and federal authorities began investigating links between the vaccine and Guillain-Barre syndrome, which causes paralysis.</p>
<p>Twelve Americans who got the swine flu vaccine died of Guillain-Barre; more than 400 were at least temporarily paralyzed. The government was left with a stockpile of 63 million doses of vaccine.</p>
<p>There's no record of any Beauvoir children suffering lasting ill effects from the experiment, but over time, Young has generally become wary of "taking steps that are not medically proven. It's very much up to the consumer to research what's really going on,'' she says.</p>
<p>Even when we know we're overreacting, we seem unable to halt the panic. We ride a pendulum that swings from too much reaction to too little. The debacle in 1976 spread enough cynicism about flu shots that millions of Americans shied away from the vaccinations for years thereafter, even when vaccines were safe and effective.</p>
<p>This time, the huge, post-9/11 investment in emergency preparedness has made us especially susceptible to scare stories, and to a false optimism that we're ready to handle whatever comes.</p>
<p>Last week, when an eighth-grader in Washington looked as if he might be the city's first case of swine flu, the communication between an anxious family and public health officials bred anything but confidence.</p>
<p>The boy showed up at his doctor's office with a 103-degree fever, headache, muscle aches, congestion and the blahs. Looks like flu, said Howard Bennett, the pediatrician. He had the patient swabbed, and the test came back positive for Influenza A -- consistent with, but not proof of, swine flu.</p>
<p>Add the fact that the family, who asked not to be named, had recently travelled to Mexico, and Bennett reported the case to the city's health department, as he was supposed to. City health officers said that they were concerned and that they'd be right over to pick up the specimen to determine if this was indeed a swine flu strain.</p>
<p>While they waited, the family took it upon themselves to pull their other children out of school and put themselves in home quarantine. Missing a day of school and work seemed a small sacrifice to prevent potential infection of others.</p>
<p>But two days went by before D.C. health officials picked up the specimen, tested it and delivered the verdict: Not swine. By then, the boy was fine, and everyone got back to school.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't have to wait days for this,'' Bennett says. "Having 24-hour turnaround is very important so you can know whether to keep kids out of school or not.''</p>
<p>Dena Iverson, the health department's spokeswoman, says that the city has so far handled 28 suspected cases of swine flu but that this one didn't quite rise to that level. "It was a case of interest but not of suspicion,'' she says, mainly because the family's trip to Mexico had ended too long before the onset of symptoms to raise alarms.</p>
<p>Once the city did get hold of the specimen, it handled the testing and results quickly, but neither the doctor nor the family had received any notice that the District of Columbia was putting their case on a slower track.</p>
<p>The lesson here is that none of us makes particularly good decisions in the throes of fear. After the 1976 fiasco, a Harvard study of what had gone wrong concluded that health officials put too much confidence in "theories spun from meagre evidence,'' government leaders put too much trust in medical specialists and everyone exhibited "premature commitment to deciding more than had to be decided.''</p>
<p>There is, indeed, a real infectious disease afoot. Its name is fear.</p>

</p>
<p>The only serious case among Canada's 165 H1N1 flu diagnoses was showing signs of improvement yesterday, as was life in the country where it all began -- a muted Cinco de Mayo holiday marking the start of Mexico's long struggle to rebuild its shattered economy.</p>
<p>Before a colourless, cancelled version of its most famous national celebration, Mexico predicted a bold comeback from a devastating viral outbreak that crippled its critically important tourism industry and carved some $2.2 US billion out of its economy.</p>
<p>Mexican Finance Secretary Augustin Carstens unveiled his plan to stimulate key industries and fight unwarranted bans on Mexican pork products, promising to lure back the lucrative tourist trade and "immediately rebuild confidence in our country.''</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in an Edmonton hospital bed, another recovery was underway: an anonymous young girl, Canada's only severe case of a condition that has killed nearly 30 people and sickened thousands around the world, was breathing on her own.</p>
<p>"I can tell you today that she's recovering well,'' said Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health. "Her condition is improving.''</p>
<p>That condition, which was worse than the vast majority of outbreak cases beyond Mexico's borders, had more to do with underlying conditions than it did with the virus itself, he suggested.</p>
<p>"The prime reason (she was in the hospital) was the swine flu,'' Corriveau said.</p>
<p>"But the other thing we're saying is there may be other factors that were part of the overall picture.''</p>
<p>It remained unclear how the girl, whose precise age was not released, became infected. Canada added 25 cases to its confirmed case list yesterday -- 10 new cases in Nova Scotia, seven in British Columbia, five in Ontario, two in Alberta and one in Quebec.</p>
<p>In the U.S., where the confirmed caseload is nearing 500, officials confirmed the death of a resident of Texas, the second H1N1 flu death to occur outside of Mexico, where 26 people have already succumbed to the virus.</p>
<p>Canada is third on the list of countries with the most cases, followed by Spain, with 57; 27 in Britain; nine in Germany; six in New Zealand; five in Italy; four in Israel and France; two each in El Salvador and South Korea and one each in several other countries.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>As of late afternoon yesterday, there was no indication the H1N1 flu virus had reached the Guelph area.</p>
<p>"There are no confirmed cases," Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health medical officer of health Dr. Nicola Mercer said.</p>
<p>Hospitals and clinics are not swamped by people concerned they may have the flu, she said.</p>
<p>That's not to say people are staying home.</p>
<p>"I know our emerg is busy," Mercer said, referring to Guelph General Hospital's emergency department.</p>
<p>But patient loads at doctors' offices she's seen "have been manageable."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, mathematics and statistics professor Chris Bauch is developing with a few other collaborators across Ontario a model to predict the virus's spread, the University of Guelph announced yesterday.</p>
<p>That'll provide insight, the university reported, into ways of countering the contagious virus infecting hundreds of people in more than 20 countries. A working model, however, is still weeks away.</p>
<p>Mercer noted 36 confirmed cases in Ontario yesterday (out of 165 nationally), and appealed to the public be vigilant through sound hygiene. That includes washing hands frequently with soap and water or alcohol-based sanitizers and covering the mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing.</p>
<p>Those feeling ill should stay at home to reduce the risk of infecting others. People should also make sure vaccinations are current, she advised.</p>
<p>In other news, the Scouts Canada Wellington regional organization announced in a release it would consider postponing all gatherings, including group camping, if the World Health Organization raises its pandemic alert to level 6 from the current 5, an indication of a wider, more severe international outbreak.</p>
<p>The WHO yesterday reported almost 1,500 cases of H1N1 in 21 countries. More than 800 of those are in Mexico, which appears to be the epicentre.</p>

</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, outbreaks of the new strain of the H1N1 flu virus have led to the issuing of two take-home messages: Experts don't know what will happen or when, and (according to the World Health Organization) it's safe eat pork.</p>
<p>After the weekend quarantine at an Alberta hog farm, which was triggered by an infected farm worker, the provincial Agriculture Minister said, "Food safety is not an issue in this case so hopefully we'll deal with science here and not emotional issues." I'm not sure which emotional issues he was referring to, but I am concerned that the science, although highly advanced in terms of molecular biology and public health protocols, is also extremely selective. When will be the right time to deal with broader issues of environmental ecology, ethology and veterinary science?</p>
<p>Both of the take-home messages are technically true. Influenza viruses are inherently unstable, their genomes subject to rapid mutation. With countless other variables due to pig and human susceptibility, transport and travel, it is truly impossible to predict what will happen, or when. Veterinary historian Dr. Russell Currier, of the American College of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, recently pointed out in an editorial that the spring wave of the 1918 influenza pandemic was milder than the deadly fall wave. That pattern may repeat itself in 2009 — who knows?</p>
<p>Zoonoses, including influenza, will always be with us in various forms, no matter our practices - they are part of this life we share with animals. However, we are not in 1918 any more. Science has moved into very efficient modes of detection and management at the microbiological and genomic level. I will certainly be considering vaccination for myself and my children when the new vaccine is produced.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the hog industry in Quebec, where I live, and elsewhere in Canada continues to stagger from crisis to conflict, punctuated by brief and heavily subsidized periods of bare subsistence. Rural dwellers and cottagers simmer with resentment because each year, we deal with more smelly days than the last, and more blue-green algae alerts in our lakes and rivers. And who can forget the dead pigs hanging from overpasses on Highway 20 between Drummondville and St-Hyacinthe in 1998, when hog producers had a collective meltdown due to plummeting prices?</p>
<p>And yet our "farms" still can't compete with mega-operations in places such as North Carolina. There, extreme-density hog operations spread over entire counties provide not just ultra-cheap pork, but additional "benefits": abundant and detailed scientific information on the symptoms of hydrogen sulphide poisoning in humans, the effects of toxic Pfiesteria bacteria on humans and fish, overfertilization by nitrate-rich liquid slurry and the wholesale contamination of coastal areas. Enough study matter to keep environmental scientists busy for decades.</p>
<p>There's more, but here I begin to tread in emotional territory. As a veterinarian, I see that companion species are not the only ones that deserve individual health care. The two domestic animal least likely to receive individual veterinary care are swine and chickens.</p>
<p>Very few aspiring veterinarians dream of working in the swine industry - perhaps for emotional reasons. Examined and treated on a herd basis, there is no concern for their sentience and sensitivity. And yet, as people who have kept either animal as pets or on hobby farms can attest, pigs and chickens have individual personalities, logical species-specific behaviours that reveal their physiology and needs, and remarkable sensitivity to physical handling and human attitudes. Veterinarians from the 1920s reporting on the behaviour of pigs during flu outbreaks said they "cry out when handled, which has been interpreted as signs of muscular tenderness." Very much like how I feel when I get the flu.</p>
<p>Influenza has never been the issue when considering the safety of eating pork. The real questions are: Do need cheap pork, or clean water and air? Cheap pork, or ethical and respectful animal husbandry?</p>
<p>For me, as a veterinarian, rural dweller and animal-welfare advocate, the answer is clear. Pork is neither safe nor good to eat. And not until the hog industry and our governments deal with the ecological science and stop abusing animals will I begin to consider it so.</p>
<p>Debbie Tacium is a veterinarian, translator and writer based in rural Quebec. She works in companion animal medicine and is an advocate for animal welfare for all domestic species.</p>

</p>
<p>A high school student with no recent history of travel outside Canada is confirmed as Halton's first case of swine flu.</p>
<p>Dr. Bob Nosal, the region's medical officer of health, and the Halton Region Health Department sent a letter yesterday through the Halton Catholic board to parents of students at the school attended by the flu patient, advising them of the case.</p>
<p>Nosal said the affected student, whose case of the H1N1 virus has been confirmed by lab tests, is at home recovering. Like other Ontario cases, the student's flu is mild, said Nosal.</p>
<p>Although he could not identify the school because of privacy protocols, parents who received the letter confirm it was Christ the King Catholic Secondary School in Georgetown, in north Halton.</p>
<p>He said the Halton health department was informed of the case Monday evening and followed up with the teen's family. Yesterday morning, it followed up with the school board.</p>
<p>The health department is investigating where the student could have been exposed to the virus.</p>
<p>There were five new cases of H1N1 flu virus (human swine flu) in Ontario yesterday, including the one in Halton.</p>
<p>There are now 36 cases in the province.</p>
<p>All the cases are considered mild and the individuals are recovering at home. Most are people who have travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>However, Nosal said it would not be surprising to see more cases if the virus keeps spreading, but that it is not spreading aggressively so far.</p>
<p>Nosal said the letter to parents includes fact sheets on what symptoms to watch for, such as fever, cough, sore throat and possibly vomiting, as well as the best preventative measures to take: washing hands frequently, coughing into one's upper sleeve and if sick, to stay home.</p>
<p>"We can't emphasize that enough," he said.</p>
<p>Nosal said the health department is tightening up surveillance at the high school and will follow up on daily absenteeism to monitor the situation.</p>
<p>"We're interested in seeing what, if any, spread there is," Nosal said.</p>
<p>He said the affected student was not at school most of the time after experiencing signs of illness.</p>

<p>TRANSPORTATION REPORTER</p>
<p><span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. WJA-T is scaling back its expansion plans due to weaker travel demand sparked by the recession and swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Calgary-based WestJet said yesterday it expects growth of 3 per cent in overall seat capacity in 2009, compared with a previously forecast 5 per cent.</p>
<p>In contrast, Air Canada predicted in February that it would shrink its overall capacity this year by between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent. Calin Rovinescu, Air Canada's chief executive officer since April 1, will provide an update on Friday, when the Montreal-based airline releases its first-quarter results.</p>
<p>Air Canada plans to cut domestic capacity by 3 to 4 per cent this year, leaving the door open for WestJet to make further gains in market share. This spring, Air Canada held 57 per cent of the domestic market and WestJet 36 per cent.</p>
<p>There are early signs that Mr. Rovinescu will be selectively expanding in overseas markets. “Twelve new flights are starting soon, adding frequencies and destinations to our network, including additional flights between Vancouver and China over and above our original plan, and three more flights between Toronto and Italy,” he said in a memo to staff. “While our company does indeed face some very serious challenges – a deep recession, depressed equity markets, the worst credit market in living memory and even fears of a global flu pandemic – it is very important that we not get distracted.”</p>
<p>WestJet CEO Sean Durfy said he's optimistic that his company will be able to bounce back from the latest slump in travel demand that occurred as the outbreak of H1N1 influenza scared away many consumers from making bookings to Mexico, where the virus originated.</p>
<p>WestJet and its vacations division cancelled service to Mexico on Monday.</p>
<p>Mr. Durfy said the carrier's domestic and transborder schedule into the United States won't escape the recession unscathed as he eliminates some red-eye routes and trims various non-peak flights.</p>
<p>“It would be a beautiful thing if we were out of this recession,” Mr. Durfy said.</p>
<p>At the airline's annual meeting webcast from Calgary, he said WestJet is willing to fill a void in the market, should Air Canada falter and abandon some routes. But WestJet has cut certain flights suffering through thin traffic, weeding out non-stop routes such as Regina-Winnipeg and Saskatoon-Winnipeg, he added in an interview.</p>
<p>Yesterday, WestJet announced a 29-per-cent drop in first-quarter profit to $37.4-million. Share profit slipped to 29 cents from 40 cents, but exceeded analysts' expectations, spurring a rally in WestJet shares.</p>

<p>MANITOBA'S pork producers want the province to provide them with between $50 million and $100 million in aid money this year.</p>
<p>Andrew Dickson, general manager of the Manitoba Pork Council, said trade embargoes imposed by countries because of fears from the H1N1 flu virus have exasperated the poor market conditions pork producers have been facing with the high dollar and high feed grain prices.</p>
<p>Dickson said the financial assistance can't come in the form of low-interest loans or advances on payments, adding the current situation means producers can't afford that kind of help.</p>
<p>Dickson said he met with Agriculture Minister Roseann Wowchuk two weeks ago but he has not received any commitment from the Doer government for financial aid.</p>
<p>It costs hog producers $145 to raise a pig to market but they're only earning $116 when it's sold, Dickson said.</p>
<p>"We're not rich," Dickson said. "A little bit of help would be appreciated right now."</p>

<p>Is it all over?</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of common stock of <span class="companylink">Smithfield Foods Inc</span>., the world's biggest producer of pork, was up 20 per cent. The traffic jams around Mexico City returned to suffocating normalcy. The New York school that was the site of the most concentrated outbreak of influenza A/H1N1 reopened. The seal hunt trumped swine flu as the top news story. And Canada's Public Health Agency decided not to have a daily flu briefing because there was nothing new to say.</p>
<p>So, yes, there are clear signs that the epidemic of fear is subsiding.</p>
<p>Scientists and public health officials are sounding a lot more optimistic as well.</p>
<p>The A/H1N1 virus does not share the most lethal traits of the Spanish flu, which leads scientists to believe it will not be a big killer. In fact, the vast majority of cases identified are mild. There are signs the outbreak is waning in Mexico and that there is not sustained transmission of the virus outside of North America.</p>
<p>While the number of new flu cases continues to increase – 1,490 cases in 21 countries, including 165 in Canada – a lot of the increase is due to clearing up the backlog of tests. Most importantly, there seems to be a slowing in the spread of the virus, which suggests we have reached the top of the pandemic curve.</p>
<p>Still, public health officials stress that it is too soon to say that swine influenza A/H1N1 no longer poses a risk of pandemic.</p>
<p>The flu season is just beginning in the southern hemisphere, so it is possible for the new flu to pick up steam and spread rapidly. Pandemics also tend to occur in waves, so this may simply be a lull. The big fear in Canada is that A/H1N1 will come back with a vengeance in the fall.</p>
<p>So, no, it's not all over, but we are beginning to treat swine flu like seasonal flu, an infectious disease that quietly kills thousands a year but remains off the public radar.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO and OTTAWA -- The Canadian embassy in Beijing has asked the Chinese government to explain its decision to confine 22 apparently healthy Canadian students in a Chinese hotel as it watches them for symptoms of a virulent new strain of flu.</p>
<p>“Our embassy in Beijing is sending a diplomatic note to the Chinese Foreign Ministry to request an explanation for the decision to place the students under medical surveillance,” Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said yesterday.</p>
<p>Although most cases in Canada and the United States have been mild, the U.S. marked its first flu-related death yesterday and a little girl in Alberta was recovering in hospital as 25 new confirmed infections were reported in this country.</p>
<p>A representative of the Canadian embassy in Beijing who travelled to the hotel in Changchun where the students from the University of Montreal are being held was allowed only a brief conversation with them.</p>
<p>“At this time, we are not aware of any medical risk factors which would have supported the decision,” Mr. Cannon said. “The diplomatic note will also voice our deep concern about officials being denied full access to the hotel where the students are quarantined, in order to provide full consular assistance.”</p>
<p>In a response posted on the website of the Chinese embassy in Ottawa, the Chinese government said the quarantine was done in accordance with the laws of China.</p>
<p>Mr. Cannon will travel to China on Friday and is likely to raise the issue with his Chinese counterpart. The students will be released from quarantine on Saturday but Foreign Affairs officials said Mr. Cannon wants to ensure that the Chinese understand Canada's position should additional quarantines be imposed as the world deals with the outbreak of the A/H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu.</p>
<p>Keiji Fukuda of the World Health Organization said yesterday that international health experts are contacting countries that have imposed quarantines to ask “about the public health justification” for their actions.</p>
<p>Richard Besser, acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said researchers have in the past looked at screening travellers. “What it has basically shown is you may gain a few weeks in terms of entry [of the virus] into your country. You're not going to prevent a virus like influenza from crossing borders,” Dr. Besser said.</p>
<p>There were signs yesterday that the virus was beginning to level off. Mexico's health authorities declared the country's swine flu epidemic under control and prepared to gradually reopen businesses and schools.</p>
<p>The WHO said yesterday the number of confirmed lab cases had reached 1,490. In Mexico, 29 people have died from the virus. Texas confirmed the first death of a U.S. resident with swine flu yesterday. The woman, who died earlier this week, lived along the U.S.-Mexico border and had other chronic health problems.</p>
<p>In Canada, there are 165 confirmed cases of the virus, but almost all of them are mild. There were 10 new cases yesterday in Nova Scotia, seven in B.C., five in Ontario, two in Alberta and one in Quebec.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in China, the government defended its decision to bar the import of Alberta pork and pork products after a herd of pigs on a central Alberta farm was found to be infected with H1N1.</p>
<p>Federal Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said he has spoken with the Chinese ambassador. “As of today, he is making our plea back to Beijing to make sure that they understand the sound science and get back to dealing with good, top quality Canadian pork,” Mr. Ritz said.</p>

<p>China has placed more than a score of visiting Canadian university students under quarantine for no other reason than that they are Canadian, and that Canada has an outbreak of the swine flu. This is a nonsensical method of disease control. Canada has 33 million people and 165 confirmed cases. There is not a shred of reported evidence that any of the quarantined Canadian visitors (or dozens of others quarantined from Mexico, the United States and elsewhere) have symptoms of the flu. While the visitors seem to be well cared for (they are being given beer and they have access to a ping-pong table, enough to keep most students happy), and China's motives seem sincere, the quarantining smacks of a totalitarian approach to public health.</p>
<p>The quarantining of the Canadians comes as Lawrence Cannon, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, prepares to visit China to try to warm relations between the two countries. (Will he be quarantined, too?) He does not need to take the aggressive approach suggested by the Liberal MP Bob Rae, who says the Chinese approach is unlawful. It would be far better to discuss with the Chinese more useful methods of control, and to explain to the Chinese that quarantining Canadians (and other foreigners) is no more justified than rounding up Chinese visitors to Canada would have been after SARS broke out in 2003 in China.</p>
<p>In the SARS outbreak, Toronto put 1 per cent of its population under quarantine, but that illness was different; it was spread mostly in hospital settings, and it was difficult to catch. Isolating individuals who had been in contact with SARS carriers was seen as an effective containment. The influenza virus is much more infectious, and moves too fast to be contained in the same way, according to Michael Gardam of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion. “One thing about influenza: you can't stop it,” Dr. Gardam says.</p>
<p>This is not really about ends and means. If confining apparently healthy individuals to a hotel worked as a method of disease control, the means would be justified. China could argue that, even if these means don't work, they don't really hurt, the deprivation of liberty being relatively minor. Maybe, but it's not a terribly friendly practice to single out healthy foreigners for a useless method of control.</p>
<p>China seems determined to isolate every strand in the haystack to find the needle. This is the obverse of the lesson China learned from SARS, when it sat on the news – pretended there was no haystack – until the disease had spread too far to be contained. Its wish to fight Influenza A H1N1 aggressively before it spreads like wildfire through its dense cities is understandable, but foreign visitors should not bear the brunt of China's anxiety without sound medical cause.</p>

<p>Efforts by hog farmers to convince consumers that pork has little to do with the H1N1 influenza virus, or swine flu, may be paying off.</p>
<p>The price of hog futures jumped nearly 2 per cent yesterday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to 64.8 cents (U.S.) a pound after falling almost every day since the first reports of the flu outbreak in Mexico last week.</p>
<p>Shares of <span class="companylink">Smithfield Foods Inc</span>.,SFD-N the world's largest pork producer, also climbed more than 24 per cent, closing up $2.38 (U.S.) at $12.25 on the New York Stock Exchange and wiping out losses since the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>A Manitoba-based hog company went ahead with a deal to buy a feed mill from food giant <span class="companylink">Cargill Inc</span>.</p>
<p>“We're probably getting away from the negative perception,” said Chad Henderson, a market analyst at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>“As the number of flu cases die down, and it's not on the front page of every major newspaper in the world, the market will stabilize … It's just a perception issue that is haunting this hog market right now.”</p>
<p>The price of hogs is still down nearly 10 per cent from before the outbreak and Mr. Henderson said it will take several more weeks before prices fully recover. “We are not out of the woods yet.”</p>
<p>But any price increase will be welcome relief for hog farmers, who have been trying to fend off suggestions the disease is linked to hogs. “It's absolutely fantastic for the producer,” said Gary Stordy, spokesman for the Canadian Pork Council. “The message that pork is safe is working.”</p>
<p>But analysts say most hog farmers are still operating at a loss and many will likely go out of business over the next few months.</p>
<p>There is an oversupply of hogs in North America and the Canadian government</p>
<p>has been paying farmers to decrease the size of their herd.</p>
<p>Farmers are also facing high costs for inputs, particularly feed made from corn.</p>
<p>Mr. Henderson said the hog market probably won't rally until next year when the number of producers is reduced. “That's what it comes down to: Who is going to hang on?”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>WRHA readies hospital beds - ERs seeing more patients</b>
</div><div>By Jen Skerritt   </div>
<div>435 words</div><div>6 May 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Winnipeg health officials have transferred 20 hospital patients to personal care homes to free up beds in case the city is hit by the global outbreak of H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Real Cloutier, the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's vice-president of long-term care, said the transfer is a precaution prompted by a slight increase in the number of patients who have visited emergency rooms with flu-like symptoms in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>More than 150 people who visited city ERs on each of Monday and Tuesday reported flu-like symptoms -- up from the normal range of 120 to 140 patients per day in February and March.</p>
<p>Although there have been no reports of severe illness from H1N1 in the province, Cloutier said the first wave of a flu pandemic would put extra strain on acute care hospitals. That's why it's important to increase bed capacity now, he said.</p>
<p>Cloutier said 20 hospital patients who were awaiting placement in a personal care home were transferred there this week, including several who were placed in respite beds.</p>
<p>Winnipeg has 26 respite beds located in personal care homes across the city. Most beds are used for aging or disabled patients to give their regular caregivers a temporary break.</p>
<p>Health officials began phoning caregivers who had made arrangements for respite care last week to see if they required urgent care or if the arrangement could be cancelled.</p>
<p>"It's a precautionary measure on our part. If we don't prepare and something happens then we'll be judged on that," Cloutier said. "We're already tight, we're just making sure we're relieving some of the pressure."</p>
<p>To date, one confirmed case of H1N1 virus has been reported in Manitoba. A girl who attends Riverheights School in Brandon is recovering from a mild case of the virus, also known as swine flu.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Canada, 25 new cases of H1N1 were reported Tuesday, bringing the total number of laboratory confirmed cases in the country to 165.</p>
<p>Manitoba's chief medical officer, Dr. Joel Kettner, said he's been informed the virus is now infecting Canadians who haven't travelled to Mexico -- a sign that the transmission of the virus continues to spread from person to person. Kettner said influenza viruses are highly contagious.</p>
<p>Scientists are baffled at why most of the cases of H1N1 outside Mexico have been relatively mild, but Kettner said it's too soon to conclude the bug won't make most people that ill.</p>

<p>“Although Earth's atmosphere may seem as permanent as the rocks, it gradually leaks back into space,” Kevin Zahnle and David Catling write in Scientific American magazine. “The loss rate is currently tiny, only about three kilograms of hydrogen and 50 grams of helium (the two lightest gases) per second, but even that trickle can be significant over geologic time, and the rate was probably once much higher.”</p>
<p>A farewell to worms</p>
<p>“While humans as a whole do live longer than ever before, we now suffer certain illnesses to a degree never seen in the past – including skyrocketing rates of diabetes and obesity and, surprisingly, ailments such as hay fever,” Charles Choi writes on MSNBC.com. “Among the possible causes for our modern ills: super-hygiene, sedentary lifestyles and a lack of worms in our stomachs.” He quotes Joel Weinstock, chief of gastroenterology at Tufts University Medical Centre in Massachusetts: “If you look back at the human race in the 20th century, every child and adult had worms in their gastrointestinal tracts. … As it turns out, worms are very potent at controlling immune reactions, in order to live happily ever after in the gut. Our theory is that when we started deworming the population, that is one factor that led to the rise in immunological diseases.”</p>
<p>Are we compatible?</p>
<p>“The process of asking someone on a date can historically be described as such: Twenty years ago, you either did it face-to-face or picked up the phone,” Monica Hesse writes in The Washington Post. “Today, you can be a phone person, an e-mail person, a text person, a Skype person, a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> wall person, a Twitter person, an instant-messaging person, or you can just stare creepily into your webcam like that manga girl on YouTube. Each form of communication has its own followers and rules. … ‘People in their 30s are the hardest hit,' says Kelli Lawless, who runs the blog Dating and Mating in America and has received many frustrated e-mails from the technologically incompatible. Members of the 40-plus population are safe – by habit, they all mostly reach for the phone. And anyone under 25 is likely to be fluent in multiple tech languages. But thirtysomethings, Lawless says, have taken independent, à la carte approaches to their communication preferences.”</p>
<p>Illusive intimacy</p>
<p>Relationship experts have spotted a modern epidemic: Modern Female Dating Anxiety (MFDA), Australian Associated Press reports. “Ryan Cassaday, a life coach, and his wife Jessica, a clinical psychologist and sex therapist, coined the phrase in their new book Stop Wondering If You'll Ever Meet Him. The couple says the condition, with symptoms like sweaty palms, shallow breathing and obsessive behaviour, has developed over the last decade as a byproduct of technological communication and casual dating practices. … The condition most commonly affects self-assured women who lose their cool on the dating circuit, the couple said in a phone interview from their home in Los Angeles. ‘They have a sense of confidence and security that somehow becomes absent in the dating situation,' Cassaday says. The evolution of ‘conveniences' like text messaging, social networking and e-mail have created ‘this illusion of intimacy' that hasn't been formed between people, Dr. Cassaday says.”</p>
<p>Elbows, not smooches</p>
<p>“The swine flu epidemic,” <span class="companylink">United Press International</span> reports, “may cut down on physical displays of friendship, with less hugging, kissing and even handshaking around the world, health officials say. The Mexican Ministry of Health has already advised residents to keep their distance from each other, CNN reports. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, the network's chief medical correspondent, advocates bumping elbows as a substitute, although he acknowledged on Twitter it is ‘not as cool as the fist bump.' ”</p>
<p>How you are happy</p>
<p>The physiological “capacity for uplift is part of what makes us essentially, euphorically human,” Jessica Winter writes in O, The Oprah Magazine. “… We can start in the general vicinity of our cleavage, with that serene, warm-chest feeling that washes over us when we're moved by an extraordinary act or by a person of great virtue … But to reach the physiological root of those sensations, we need to take a close look at the vagus nerve – actually a bundle of nerves that starts at the base of the brain and branches out through the body, linking up with the facial and vocal muscles and the heart, lungs and gut. Acting as a messenger between the central nervous system and the major organs, the vagus nerve slows the heart rate (through the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine), calms the immune response (by controlling the release of proteins called cytokines), and communicates with the muscles that control respiration and digestion.”</p>

<p>President of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion</p>
<p>When it comes to home, auto and life insurance, most Canadians are adequately covered. We hope that nothing ever happens, but quietly pay our premiums to give us what the insurance companies advertise as “peace of mind.” When something does happen – a car crash, a break-in or a basement flood – we expect quick action and advice from our insurer.</p>
<p>The same analogy can be made with public health, the often invisible component of the health-care system. Its role is to prevent diseases and injuries from happening or to lessen their impact through early detection and treatment. In fact, when public health is successful, nothing happens, and therefore there is no news to report. You will never see a headline citing how many people dined in a clean restaurant, avoided an injury or did not contract a sexually transmitted disease.</p>
<p>However, when an outbreak such as listeriosis or the H1N1 flu virus occurs, there is panic. Conflicting news stories fuel emotions and behaviours, questioning whether health officials are raising false alarms or are moving too slowly.</p>
<p>Dealing with uncertainty is always a challenge. News cycles move much more frequently than the virus's incubation period. While our understanding is improving continually, the knowledge base for predicting what will happen next will not change from day to day or even week to week.</p>
<p>Even if things do settle down over the next few weeks, there remains a serious risk that the H1N1 virus will return in the fall. And if things settle down for good, we will never know for sure what role was played by increased vigilance and mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>What Canadians need to understand about the current situation is that public health is ready. We do not know clearly what the flu virus's next moves will be, but lots of people have worked for many years to model the best possible directions. Plans are in place to cover all scenarios.</p>
<p>To manage the most severe outcomes, a variety of different partners throughout society will have to work together. Employers, educational institutions and the entire population have a responsibility for managing public health. It takes time to mobilize and fully inform all these groups. That is why starting to implement the plans as early as possible – even before the nature of the virus and its epidemiology and biology are fully understood – is important. If we waited and it turned out to be the worst-case scenario, it would have been too late. And if it turns out not to be severe, we will have learned lots of lessons for the next round.</p>
<p>So far, the news looks good. The disease seen outside Mexico is mild. The virus does not seem to move too quickly into the community. It is sensitive to the antiviral drugs in our stockpiles. Our plans are being implemented successfully for the first time on an international scale.</p>
<p>Public-health authorities at all levels will continue to monitor the situation and provide guidance long after the H1N1 virus moves off the newspapers' front pages. In fact, they will continue to promote the best science on how to enhance the health of Canadians, whether with respect to infectious diseases, chronic diseases, injury prevention or environmental health (topics that are not as sexy as pandemics).</p>
<p>What we need is to continue to ensure we have “public health insurance” so that it is there when we need it and when we don't know we need it.</p>

<div>MUSIC / AN ODE TO THE LOST ANTHEM</div>
<div>The Globe Review</div>

<p>Burt Bacharach once wrote that what the world needs now is love, sweet, love; John Lennon sang the same. But now that soldiers are dying, swine flu is flying and the economy is in the bog, the world doesn't want love. It wants a real-deal hair-raising song for the ages. And it isn't hearing it.</p>
<p>To songwriters and the recording industry, a Depression-whacked public asks a reasonable question: “Brother, can you spare a song?”</p>
<p>Recently on CBC Radio One's The Sunday Edition, Robert Harris presented Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? from 1932 for his series on world-changing music. A compelling argument can be made for the song's singularity: It was in a minor key, unlike most Broadway material; it was a sobering, era-reflective story-song that improbably became a hit; and its downbeat tone differed sharply with zippier Depression-period anthems such as We're in the Money.</p>
<p>Given the current financial climate, Harris and host Michael Enright speculated that songs like Brother probably couldn't be written today. Of course, that's not true – such relevant and emblematic songs are being written. What is true, thanks to increasingly diffuse pop culture outlets, is that a topical pop tune no longer has the galvanizing, era-dominating impact of the commemorative hits of the past.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, at Madison Square Garden in New York, 90 birthday candles were blown out by Pete Seeger, the legendary protest-music pioneer who, in a way, taught America to sing. Feting Seeger were such light-shiners as Bruce Springsteen (who performed The Ghost of Tom Joad with Tom Morello) and John Mellencamp (offering a solo acoustic version of Seeger's If I Had a Hammer). Joan Baez, Steve Earle, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Kris Kristofferson and Kate and Anna McGarrigle and many others celebrated the communal music of Seeger, responsible for writing or popularizing folk standards We Shall Overcome, Turn! Turn! Turn! and Where Have All the Flowers Gone?</p>
<p>Most of the crowd-swaying tunes were written a long, long time ago. After a spectacular bulge of flower-power anthemia ended with Don McLean's American Pie in 1971, music listeners haven't exactly been inundated with the type of songs that, when heard, stop you in your tracks. Without the contributions of Bob Geldof (Do They Know It's Christmas? and the celebrity-choir charitable fare that followed), Neil Young (Rockin' in the Free World) and the bullhorn-ready Bono (Sunday Bloody Sunday), the roll call of high-impact, rallying music is slim indeed.</p>
<p>“Pop culture is illiterate now,” says McLean, when asked about the absence of anthems. “Nobody really cares about words, and they don't care about melody either.” American Pie – a semi-autobiographical pop opus described by McLean as an “epic song about America” – lacked none for melody, lyrical imagery and meaning.</p>
<p>The song, inspired by the 1959 plane crash that took the lives of Buddy Holly, Richie Havens and the Big Bopper, concerns the loss of personal and national innocence. Decades after he wrote American Pie, the 63-year-old singer-songwriter is still finding dry levees. “In order to write an anthem, you have to be at least reasonably poetic,” he despairs. “And I don't think that people today have the verbal wherewithal.</p>
<p>“People love language, they crave it,” continues McLean, set to release his new Addicted to Black album soon. “But the support for it is drifting away. Society is not going in the direction of poetry. It's going in the direction of numbers.”</p>
<p>When McLean mentions numbers, he's referring to technology and its effect on arts and culture. With the Internet and portable listening devices, access to music is easier than ever. And the availability of new songs is beyond instantaneous – albums are routinely leaked before scheduled release dates.</p>
<p>But the outlets for pop music are so diffuse now that it's difficult for one song to dominate the sprawling mainstream. “We're in this celebrity culture where the potential for reaching a large audience with a serious topic is diminished,” says Tom Moon, author of 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die.</p>
<p>There are meaningful works being written. Joe Henry's Our Song is a poignant piece from 2007, often compared to Paul Simon's Mrs. Robinson. In the same way Simon uses Joe DiMaggio, Henry employs Willie Mays as a metaphor for a country's loss of grace. Most people haven't heard Our Song.</p>
<p>Prominent inclusion in the Dustin Hoffman film The Graduate certainly did much for Mrs. Robinson's popularity. And while mainstream cinema is probably the best vehicle to deliver an anthem to a concentrated audience today, a song's placement in a film doesn't guarantee a thing. Eddie Vedder's Hard Sun (from Sean Penn's Into the Wild, in 2007) is a thoughtful tune with a full-size chorus – “There's a big/ A big hard sun/ beating on the big people/ in the big hard world” – and yet it was only a modest hit.</p>
<p>It's simply hard for songs to resonate now as they did in yesteryear's smaller world. To Bruce Cockburn's mind, it comes down to demographics. “You have songs that will speak for a given group of people,” comments the voice of If I Had a Rocket Launcher, a 1984 hit that spoke sharply for Reagan-haters, “but they don't speak for everybody.”</p>
<p>So, for a violence-weary hip-hop community, you have 1995's Gangsta Paradise by Coolio (extremely inspired by Stevie Wonder). For U.S. super-patriots, there's God Bless the U.S.A., from the flag-draped country-music singer Lee Greenwood.</p>
<p>Cockburn, currently touring behind the just-released Slice O' Life - Solo Live, performed at Seeger's bash, presenting the 1930s union classic Which Side Are You On? with Ani DiFranco. The socially conscious singer-songwriter – he “kicks the darkness 'til it bleeds daylight” – is worried that the anthems sung at Madison Square Garden will represent a power waned. “I think songs that express the general feeling in the air are being written all the time,” he says. “But the likelihood of them having that central place in people's imagination today, and speaking for the people as a response, is pretty slim.”</p>
<p>Joe Henry's Our Song was released on Sept. 11, a date chosen meaningfully. “This was our country, this was our song,” he sings, “somewhere in the middle there, though it started badly and it's ending wrong.” In an elegant and eloquent way, Henry was commenting on an America that had lost its righteous path. He might not have known it, but he was writing too about the vanished mighty sway of music.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Give anthems a chance</p>
<p>Where have all the anthems gone? Once fairly common, the big songs-of-the-times have gone the way of the Buffalo Springfield. Here's some of the great, era-commemorative music.</p>
<p>Stars and Stripes: Patriotic song America the Beautiful was written as a poem in 1895; My Country, 'Tis of Thee, from decades earlier, was stunningly sung by Aretha Franklin at the Obama inauguration concert. Irving Berlin's God Bless America (1918) was another national anthem more singable than The Star-Spangled Banner. Woody Guthrie's buoyant call for unity, This Land Is Your Land from 1940, responds to Berlin's blatant flag-waiving.</p>
<p>The Dirty Thirties: The economic calamity of the Great Depression devastated the recording industry but couldn't stop songs that reflected a range of emotions. Where 1932's Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? was poignantly downbeat, 1933's We're in the Money was defiant and hopeful..</p>
<p>The Times They are</p>
<p>a-Changin': The flower-power 1960s produced a wealth of tuneful commentary, from Bob Dylan's Blowin' in the Wind to Sam Cooke's hopeful gospel-blues response A Change Is Gonna Come. Buffalo Springfield's brooding For What It's Worth reacted to the 1966 Sunset Strip riots in Los Angeles; Neil Young wrote Ohio immediately after the Kent State shootings.</p>
<p>Young Man Blues: Anthems needn't be hummable or sweeping; angsty, restless rock 'n' roll serves too. Eddie Cochran had no cure for the Summertime Blues, the Rolling Stones couldn't get any Satisfaction (“no, no, no”), and people tried to put My Generation down, just because the Who got around.</p>
<p>Lennonism: “That is, I think I disagree.” If the Ono-loving Beatle left any legacy, it was his unbending idealism. All You Need Is Love, Give Peace a Chance and Imagine proposed new ways at looking at the world.</p>
<p>Stayin' Alive in the Seventies: Disco music wasn't simply about doing a little dance and making a little love (as K.C. and the Sunshine Band would have you believe). The Village People's Y.M.C.A., Sister Sledge's We Are Family and Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive were declarations of empowerment and community for blacks, women and gays.</p>
<p>The Geldof Years: A burst of celebrity altruism came in 1984-85, in the form of global jukebox hits and a Live Aid concert. Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas? gathered British stars in relief of Ethiopian famine; We Are the World was sung mostly by Americans (including composers Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson); and the David Foster-produced Tears are Not Enough used the voices of Neil Young, Anne Murray and co-writer Bryan Adams, and had a chorus of Paul Anka, Tommy Hunter and Oscar Peterson, among others.</p>
<p>Ain't That America: Somewhere along the way the American dream went wrong, a sentiment reflected in often-misunderstood anti-anthems by Bruce Springsteen (Born in the USA, 1984) John Mellencamp (Pink Houses, 1983) and Neil Young (Rockin' in the Free World, 1989).</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hard lessons of SARS crisis explain China's tough action; In Beijing's view, quarantining Canadians and banning Alberta pork are sensible precautions</b>
</div><div>Wenran Jiang   </div>
<div>Senior Fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada</div>
<div>1028 words</div><div>6 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Canada and the world well remember the SARS epidemic, and China paid a heavy price for its dismal initial response.</p>
<p>This time around, Beijing is not taking any chances with a potential outbreak of H1N1 influenza A, or swine flu, within its borders. Aggressive measures have been taken to combat the perceived danger, and both Canadians travelling in China and Alberta pork products are among the targets.</p>
<p>Although the virus did not originate in China, the authorities have been on high alert. Senior Chinese leaders have been on the case from the beginning, and the Chinese press has followed the flu story closely with a rather open attitude. President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao have presided over meetings at the highest levels of the government and Communist party - an unusual move that signals how concerned the top leadership is.</p>
<p>When the first case of H1N1 was detected in China a week ago - a Mexican passenger who took a flight from Mexico to Shanghai and then to Hong Kong - he was immediately treated and isolated in a hospital. Then a large-scale operation no less than a manhunt was mounted: all the passengers on all Mexico-Shanghai-Hong Kong flights were located and put into involuntary quarantine; their family members also were required to undergo housebound health monitoring; and the Hong Kong hotel where the ill passenger stayed was sealed off and all the guests were put under close observation.</p>
<p>The Chinese government went further by rounding up some 40 Mexican nationals in major Chinese cities for observation, even though tests indicated they did not have the virus. This led to a protest from the Mexican government, which complained that its citizens were unfairly targeted. Beijing stood firm and now the two countries have agreed to send reciprocal chartered flights to bring back their citizens.</p>
<p>In an indication of China's commitment to block any possible transmission route for the virus, local officials in the northeast city of Changchun placed 25 newly arrived Canadian students from the University of Montreal under quarantine, even though they showed no signs of being infected. And China was among the first countries to declare a ban on pork products from Alberta, where the first case of H1N1 infection among a herd of pigs was found.</p>
<p>Facing the Canadian government's condemnation of the ban and its threat to go to the World Trade Organization over the matter, Beijing is not backing down. Foreign ministry spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu stated yesterday that what China did, based on its assessment of the situation, was in accordance with WTO and World Health Organization rules.</p>
<p>Has China's reaction been excessive or, as some have charged, has it taken discriminatory measures against the Mexicans and other foreigners? Not really - at least not in light of China's experience.</p>
<p>Beijing certainly has not been racially motivated in dealing with the current crisis. In fact, China was among the very first group of countries to deliver large-scale of aid to Mexico after the flu outbreak. Mexican President Felipe Calderon personally went to the airport to receive a $1 million (U.S.) donation from the Chinese ambassador and a cargo plane of supplies. And the Chinese authorities have put more Chinese nationals under observation than foreigners.</p>
<p>But more importantly, the Chinese reaction to the current flu crisis reflects the painful lessons it learned from the SARS crisis. First, there must be a swift and firm response to the earliest signs of a pandemic outbreak. Failure to do so in the early stages of the SARS outbreak caused loss of life in China and around the world. This may explain the high level of national mobilization this time.</p>
<p>Second, there must be a comprehensive national and international tracking system that can identify and trace every possible lead of the infection, in terms of both the regions and people involved. Failure to do so during the SARS crisis let the virus travel to Toronto and other parts of the world with deadly consequences. China is determined not to let such a thing happen again - this time potentially in reverse order.</p>
<p>Third, there must be forward-looking, better-safe-than-sorry measures in place in anticipation of the worst-case scenario. China was criticized for the initial cover-up and its less than thorough response during the SARS epidemic. Beijing now has an all-out war mentality to avoid facing similar accusations this time around.</p>
<p>Beijing's firm stand also is due to the fact that China's population is much more highly concentrated than that of most other countries. If there were an outbreak, the scale would be much larger and far more difficult to contain.</p>
<p>In addition, China is the largest producer of pork in the world, and consumes half of the world's pork products. It does not have a nationwide anti-virus vaccination program for its swine population. The complexity and uncertainty of the H1N1 virus may be behind Beijing's quick decision to ban pork from Alberta. We may charge that the decision is not "scientific," but a Chinese online opinion poll yesterday showed that over 97 per cent of the Chinese people support the government's ban.</p>
<p>So rather than threats and confrontational methods, Ottawa would be better advised to try to understand China's sense of insecurity over a potential deadly swine flu pandemic. When Foreign Minster Lawrence Cannon travels to Beijing next week for his scheduled visit, he would be wise to discuss this issue with persuasion, not threats - that is, if he is not quarantined upon arrival.</p>

<p>Protesters vs. the public,</p>
<p>Editorial, April 30</p>
<p>This editorial was unbalanced. It is very difficult to have meaningful issues raised through our media, and the Tamils had little choice but cause disruptions if they wanted to capture public attention to a tragic situation in their homeland and wake up our do-nothing politicians.</p>
<p>The Star and other media would rather rave about a few deaths from swine flu when there are thousands of people dying at the hands of a brutal military regime in Sri Lanka that has expelled foreign journalists, NGO personnel and anyone else who might report on the atrocities in the Tamil regions. The media have a responsibility to hear the voices of the suffering.</p>

</p>
<p>Ontario confirmed five new cases of the flu yesterday, including the second case of person-to-person infection. There are now 36 confirmed cases in the province.</p>
<p>Across the country, public health authorities announced 25 new cases yesterday, to bring the total number in Canada to 165. In addition to the five in Ontario, there were seven new cases in British Columbia, two in Alberta, one in Quebec and 10 in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Ontario experts are encouraged by what they believe is a "plateau" of the situation in Mexico, and also by the fact that all cases in Canada, with the exception of a young girl hospitalized in Alberta, are quite mild, said Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting chief medical officer of health. However, he expects more cases in Ontario will be confirmed as lab results appear.</p>
<p>Person-to-person spread has happened in two cases, "close contact in a circle of family contacts at this stage," Williams said. "This is not unusual or unexpected."</p>
<p>The flu has spread to both Halton Region and Ottawa. A Georgetown high school student at Christ the King Catholic Secondary is recovering at home, board officials say. In Barrie, a student at St. Joan of Arc High School tested positive for the swine flu, said the Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a woman in Texas became the second person in the United States to die from the virus.</p>
<p>Mexico announced steps yesterday to jump-start an economy punished by the epidemic. Cinco de Mayo celebrations, however, will have to wait until next year.</p>
<p>Holiday events remained cancelled even though no deaths were reported in Mexico in the last five days and the country prepared to reopen for business.</p>
<p>Finance Secretary Augustin Carstens said the outbreak has cost Mexico's economy at least $2.2 billion, and announced a $1.3 billion stimulus package mostly for small businesses and tourism, the hardest hit sectors.</p>

</p>
<p><span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>., which yesterday posted a 29 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings, is planning to trim its growth plans for the rest of the year in the face of a difficult economic environment and fears about the global spread of the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Sean Durfy, the chief executive of WestJet, warned on a conference call that the next few months would be tough for the airline. He said WestJet will reduce its capacity growth rate to 3 per cent from 5 per cent for the remainder of the year. The cuts will come mostly from the airline's domestic schedule, with fewer red-eye flights and fewer flights on less popular days, Durfy said.</p>
<p>"When it rains, it sure pours doesn't it? The economy isn't showing signs of an upswing and the recent H1N1 flu virus is hitting the psyche of the travelling public hard."</p>
<p>Durfy added, however, that WestJet bookings have rebounded slightly over the past few days as health authorities in Mexico, the epicentre of the flu outbreak, suggested that the number of people being infected may have stabilized in their country.</p>
<p>Like other airlines in Canada, WestJet cancelled flights to destinations in Mexico over the next month because of the outbreak.</p>
<p>WestJet said its first-quarter earnings fell to $37 million, or 29 cents a share, compared to $52 million, or 40 cents, during the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Profitability was hurt as the weak economy caused fewer people to travel and the industry responded by dropping fares in a bid to keep planes full.</p>
<p>While a 29 per cent drop in earnings would not normally be received as positive news, investors were pleased with the fact that WestJet beat expectations and managed to post its 15th consecutive quarter of industry-leading margins, according to David Newman, an analyst at National Bank Financial.</p>
<p>Calgary-based WestJet's shares rose more than 6 per cent, or 87 cents, to close at $13.35 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>"We remain cautious on the remainder of 2009, despite the drop in fuel prices," said Newman in a note to clients.</p>
<p>"As the potential for a tougher pricing environment in an increasingly weak economic environment, slackening demand, easing capacity growth and Canadian dollar weakness will weigh on its outlook."</p>
<p>Durfy said WestJet should be able to continue growing its share of the market this year, as rival Air Canada is expected to continue to cut back on its domestic flying.</p>

</p>
<p>The airline industry's challenges finally caught up with <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. during the first quarter, driving down its earnings by nearly 29 per cent and forcing it to scale back its growth plans for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>While management said they expect to turn a profit in the second quarter, weakening demand for air travel continued to force it to cut fares in order to fill planes. The recent outbreak of swine flu in Mexico has only exacerbated that situation, management added.</p>
<p>"The second quarter is shaping up to be an interesting time. When it rains, it sure pours," said Sean Durfy, WestJet chief executive, on a conference call. "The economy isn't showing signs of an upswing and the recent H1N1 influenza virus is hitting the psyche of the travelling public hard."</p>
<p>While the airline's bookings appear to be recovering somewhat this week, Durfy said it was too early to quantify the impact of the flu outbreak on the airline's revenue per available seat miles -- an important gauge of the airline's profitability. Even without it though, management said they expect RASM to fall at least 10 per cent in the second quarter due to pricing pressure. That is down from its previous forecast of a 6.5 per cent decline.</p>
<p>Those declines, however, will be offset somewhat by lower fuel costs during the quarter, management noted.</p>
<p>Still, declining demand in Mexico and the domestic market led the carrier to scale back its capacity growth plans from five per cent during the second quarter to between one per cent and two per cent, and for the year from five per cent to three per cent.</p>
<p>The carrier still plans to grow its fleet to 86 aircraft in 2009, but will cut some of its less-profitable mid-week flights and red-eye flying to curtail its growth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, difficulties implementing its new reservation system at the same time as its frequent flyer program has led to the latter being delayed until at least the end of the year. Durfy had wanted the frequent flyer program launched next month.</p>
<p>Despite the setbacks, WestJet stock jumped nearly seven per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday to close at $13.35. Those gains were made in part because WestJet's first quarter earnings of $37.4 million, or 29 cents a share, beat the Street's estimates of 22.5 cents a share.</p>

</p>
<p>Victoria businesses are prepping for an influx of shoppers today when two super-sized cruise ships are expected to pull into Ogden Point at around noon.</p>
<p>"We have extended our hours until 8 p.m.," said Debbie Stewart, assistant manager of Artina's Jewellery, 1002 Government St. The store normally closes at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Extra staff are being brought in as well, she said.</p>
<p>Cruise ship visits are exciting, Stewart said, adding "we do get busy and you get to meet so many people."</p>
<p>It will be a landmark day for Ogden Point as the two largest cruise ships ever to visit tie their lines.</p>
<p>Royal Caribbean Line's Mariner of the Seas and Carnival Cruise Line's Carnival Splendor each carry about 3,000 passengers. Businesses and attractions are pleased with the length of the stays -- each 10 hours.</p>
<p>The ships were rerouted to Victoria after the outbreak of swine flu in Mexico led to new itineraries. Victoria will get an extra 21 visits combined from the two ships, creating a total of $5 million in direct spending, the Greater Victoria Harbour Authority said. The visits bring the total this season to a record 235.</p>
<p>"We are really quite delighted that the ships are coming," said Graham Bell, spokesman for the <span class="companylink">Butchart Gardens</span>.</p>
<p>Spring flowers are delivering a "real punch of colour," he said.</p>
<p>The Downtown Victoria Business Association e-mailed businesses yesterday, encouraging them to stay open longer to serve visitors. "These numbers are almost equivalent to the busiest day in summer when three cruise ships are in port," the message said.</p>
<p>Ken Kelly, association general manager, said the two ships are "giving a real kick-start to the season."</p>
<p>Carnival Splendor passengers are adventure tourists, he said. "Those people are going to bound down the gangway ... they are going to want to discover this downtown, every square foot of it."</p>

</p>
<p>An elementary school in Metchosin has been closed after up to 30 per cent of its students contracted an influenza-like illness, health officials said yesterday.</p>
<p>As of last night, there had been no confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza, the human swine flu virus, among students at Hans Helgesen Elementary School, said Dr. Richard Stanwick, the chief medical health officer for the Vancouver Island Health Authority. However, Stanwick ordered the school closed immediately because an estimated 25 to 30 per cent of its students have been absent over the past two days with fever, cough and nausea.</p>
<p>Stanwick ordered the temporary closure to reduce the potential spread of illness, determine its cause and to allow sufficient time for specimen analysis to be completed, said VIHA spokeswoman Shannon Marshall.</p>
<p>The school will be closed until at least Friday. An update will be provided as soon as new information is available.</p>
<p>Public health staff are testing a number of students. Testing will include an assessment for H1N1 influenza, the strain that has caused illness in Mexico and other countries. Six cases have been confirmed on Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>Stanwick recommends students be monitored if they have fever, coughs, sore throats, headaches, muscle aches, nausea and weakness.</p>

<p>Seven more cases of H1N1 human swine flu were confirmed yesterday in B.C., raising the provincial total to 46.</p>
<p>Thirty-three cases are in the Lower Mainland, six on Vancouver Island and seven in the Interior or North. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control says all are mild, and patients have recovered or are recovering.</p>
<p>Decker Lake Elementary School, just west of Burns Lake, is closed until further notice after a cluster of students showed flu symptoms Friday. Three have the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Vernon's Beairsto Elementary School is closed this week after a student tested positive for the H1N1 virus. She is recovering well.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Time to file a new flight plan that puts passengers first; Canada's airlines are feeling the pressure as MPs ponder a bill that would impose tough penalties for flight delays and cancellations.</b>
</div><div>The Leader-Post</div>
<div>424 words</div><div>6 May 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>B10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Already buffeted by turbulent economic times, Canada's airlines are bracing for a rough ride over passengers' rights.</p>
<p>Oh yes, the passengers -- those too-often-neglected folk who endure interminable delays, cancellations, lost luggage and poor in-flight service and often get a grudging apology and little or no financial compensation in return.</p>
<p>"Sorry" doesn't cut it if your annual vacation has been shortened by missed connections, your baggage is sitting in another city or a delay has left your aircraft parked on the apron and you are sweltering in your seat because you're not allowed to get off.</p>
<p>And what of those travellers in the past week whose flights to Mexico were cancelled by the airlines because of the swine flu outbreak? Only WestJet offered passengers a full refund, while other tour operators, including <span class="companylink">Transat A. T</span>., and Air Canada Vacations merely offered to postpone flights until later in the year or send travellers to another one of their destinations.</p>
<p>Under a proposed Passenger Bill of Rights now before Parliament, airlines and tour operators would have to offer passengers a full refund in such circumstances -- or face a penalty of $1,000 payable to each passenger.</p>
<p>Though the legislation isn't federal government policy -- it's a private member's bill tabled by Manitoba NDP MP Jim Maloway -- it has struck a chord with all three opposition parties in the minority Parliament and stands a real chance of becoming law.</p>
<p>That prospect has the airlines flapping, for the bill also proposes steep fines when airlines keep passengers in planes stranded on the tarmac for longer than an hour, and for failing to quickly announce flight delays, route changes or cancellations.</p>
<p>Air Canada, Jazz, WestJet and <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span> say the bill might even threaten passenger safety by pressuring flight crews to take risks to avoid delays. The airlines say they can better address passenger complaints through existing federal regulation, which details passenger rights to meal vouchers and hotel rooms in the event of certain delays and cancellation refunds, but avoids the financial penalties and other compensation contained in Maloway's bill.</p>
<p>While the proposed legislation might be too tough for the airlines right now, something stronger than a list of good intentions is clearly required. Passengers deserve a smoother ride than they've been getting.</p>

</p>
<p>Preparing for a possible pandemic takes on a whole new perspective when the plan involves several hundred people under lock and key.</p>
<p>But such a preparedness plan has been fine-tuned over several years by the Ministry of Corrections, Public Safety and Policing, ready to be put in place in provincial facilities if the H1N1 flu virus is uncovered in Saskatchewan, said spokeswoman Judy Orthner.</p>
<p>"It's so critical for us when people are in close quarters as they are in our facilities to be able to react quickly to an outbreak of anything," said Orthner.</p>
<p>"Our plans are in place to mitigate the potential of it happening in the first place, but if it does happen the next step is to mitigate its spread."</p>
<p>With the World Health Organization last week increasing its pandemic alert to five on the six-level scale, the pandemic planning committees that exist in the Corrections facilities have been activated, she said.</p>
<p>"What that means is we're now reviewing the current plans to make sure if the situation does step up we will be prepared," said Orthner, noting facilities are making sure they have stockpiles of items such as masks, disposable thermometers and Tylenol.</p>
<p>The preparedness plan will officially kick in if there is a confirmed case of H1N1 flu in Saskatchewan, Orthner said.</p>
<p>Visits to inmates would be cancelled along with programming, although face-to-face meetings with lawyers could still be arranged, she said.</p>
<p>The temperatures of inmates and young offenders would be monitored to gauge whether someone was falling ill. An infected inmate would be isolated in a single cell in a designated area. The old unit would be placed on quarantine for a few days to see if anyone else was sick, Orthner said.</p>
<p>Because cell space can be an issue, an alternative would be to isolate a sick inmate in his own cell and quarantine a whole unit to prevent the spread of illness across the facility, she added.</p>
<p>In dorm units that house low risk offenders, if an ill inmate couldn't be moved out of the room, his bed would be distanced from the rest to minimize the risk of a virus spreading.</p>
<p>Orthner said the plans are crucial not only because the inmates live in close quarters.</p>
<p>"Many of the people in our custody, be they young offenders or inmates, would have had poor health habits to begin with before they entered custody, so there's good potential that they might be more susceptible to some kind of larger outbreak of anything in our facilities," she said.</p>

<p>NEW FOOD SERVICES FOR ART GALLERY</p>
<p>The Bamboo restaurant in the Art Gallery of Windsor will close after Friday this week.</p>
<p>Gilles Hebert, gallery director, announced restaurant owners Gino Parco and Jonathan Reaume with Toscana Restaurant and Wine Bar, 3891 Dougall Ave., will open Contempo Cafe in June. Services will include catering, beginning May 15.</p>
<p>Look for "exciting changes, including decor, menu, hours of operation, catering services and name change," Hebert said in the news release of the announcement Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Contempo Cafe will open in early June, with hours from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday and dinner service on Friday from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.</p>
<p>"We intend to bring everything that makes Toscana such a rewarding experience to Contempo," Gino Parco said in the news release.</p>
<p>Parco had operated the gallery restaurant several years ago.</p>
<p>Anthony-John Dalupan, who has operated Bamboo for three years with his wife Kathleen Hart, said the lease wasn't renewed and the gallery had requested proposals for food services.</p>
<p>Dalupan said he didn't participate in the process because he didn't think the financial terms would make the business viable.</p>
<p>For now, Dalupan, an acclaimed chef, said he's looking for a job, and his wife has found work in London.</p>
<p>The gallery at 401 Riverside Dr. W., has become a high-profile venue for many events, recently hosting the CBC's National news broadcast from Windsor.</p>
<p>FLU OUTBREAK AND FOOD SAFETY</p>
<p>National and international health and food inspection agencies continue to offer assurances about food safety since the recent outbreak of H1N1 influenza A, or human swine flu.</p>
<p>While pork remains safe to eat, downtown restaurateur Thom Racovitis said he continues to receive questions, comments and inquiries from concerned consumers.</p>
<p>Health Canada's website offers information and answers to common question and states the virus, a respiratory illness, "is not transmitted through pork meat."</p>
<p>While the flu strain is not food-borne, news reports indicate about 20 countries have banned pork imports in response to the discovery of the flu strain in a herd of pigs on a central Alberta hog farm.</p>
<p>Proper handling and cooking can reduce the risk of food-borne illnesses.</p>
<p>The Health Canada website www.hc-sc.gc.ca[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca] offers precautions, information and links.</p>
<p>WINE COMPETITION RETURNS TO WINDSOR</p>

<p>After reading about the illnesses that plague our world and today, the swine flu, the common denominator in helping to stop the spread of these infectious diseases is the simple act of washing your hands.</p>
<p>I cannot count how many times I have been in a public restroom and seen the person exit without washing their hands.</p>
<p>Who knows what this person may be carrying or what they may be picking up from someone else?</p>
<p>Then, just the common sense of staying home while sick instead of visiting your nearest <span class="companylink">Wal-mart</span>.</p>
<p>This is how things spread and get out of control. They are saying on TV to stay home, stay away from others until you are feeling better.</p>
<p>They remind us every time there is an outbreak of an illness. Not everyone listens.</p>
<p>Ever go to emergency at the hospital to find people coughing, sneezing, etc., then they go out for a smoke while waiting to see the doctor? Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Stay home, get some rest, drink some tea and take some Tylenol and, hopefully, in a few days you will feel better. Granted, if it worsens, then a visit to the doctor is a must.</p>
<p>But many just go for the mildest of cases and clog the emergency rooms.</p>
<p>I do believe that the insensitive and discourteous people put us all at risk. We need to wake up and realize that it will only get worse if we don't start being more aware and educate ourselves and others in the ways to prevent illness.</p>
<p>The papers, doctors, nurses and media are always informing us, but many are not paying attention.</p>
<p>Hygiene is very important. Our health and the health of others will benefit immensely. Hand sanitizer is all over the hospitals -- hint, hint, use it.</p>
<p>Spread some kindness, not your germs.</p>
<p>After all, cleanliness is next to godliness. Is it not?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Let's avoid a porcine panic</b>
</div><div>Michael Fumento   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>631 words</div><div>6 May 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>There's panic over an outbreak of swine flu. "Projections are that this virus will kill one million Americans," the top U. S. health official has warned. But the date is 1976. And the projection proves off by 999,999 deaths. Direct ones, that is. The hastily developed vaccine ends up killing or crippled hundreds. Sadly, the hysteria over the current swine flu outbreak threatens much worse --devastation on a worldwide scale.</p>
<p>A reasonable way to look at the current outbreak of the virus now known as influenza A (H1N1) is to compare it to seasonal flu. On average, seasonal flu and its complications hospitalize about 20,000 Canadians a year and kill 4,000. That's about 140 hospitalizations and over 25 deaths per day during flu season.</p>
<p>Worldwide deaths are 250,000 to 500,000, according to the World Health Organization, or about 700 to 1,400 per day spread out over the year.</p>
<p>All indications are that swine flu is both less harmful and harder to transmit than seasonal flu. The symptoms are the same, and swine flu cases so far have been quite mild. As of this writing, the death rate is zero out of 534 confirmed cases in 20 countries aside from Mexico, with 101 in Canada. Mexicans account for 590 cases and all of the world's 26 deaths.</p>
<p>There's no "Mexican puzzle." All infectious diseases strike much harder in underdeveloped countries, partly because of poorer health care but primarily because the people are less healthy to begin with.</p>
<p>Infectiousness is measured by what's called a "basic reproductive number." The higher the number, the more contagious a virus is. Mexico's National Center for Epidemiology and Disease Control has announced that preliminary models show that figure in the Mexico City metropolitan area is 1.5--a fairly low number. The basic reproductive number for seasonal flu seems to range from 1.5 to 3.0.</p>
<p>The moniker "swine flu" spooks many. But pigs routinely transmit seasonal flu to humans. "Swine flu" simply means the virus contains some pig flu genetic material.</p>
<p>Swine flu won't become "another</p>
<p>Spanish Flu of 1918-19," as pig flu panic purveyors claim. Nothing will. It's been 90 years. Back then we were hobbled by a world war, general health in developed nations was much poorer than in Mexico today and we've since developed antibiotics as well as antivirals. In all flu outbreaks, including the Spanish one, secondary bacterial infections cause the vast majority of deaths.</p>
<p>It's true we have no vaccine for this flu. But two years ago, two of the three strains in the seasonal flu vaccine were mismatched against the actual viruses in circulation. There was no appreciable increase in cases or deaths.</p>
<p>Pathetically, swine flu hysteria is now delivering a gut punch to the global economy, posing a serious risk of a recession within the recession.</p>
<p>It was SARS hysteria -- and not the relatively tiny number of cases -- that cost the economies of East and Southeast Asia 0.6 percentage points of 2003 GDP, according to the Asian Development Bank. And a World Bank report last year estimated that just the costs of avoiding infection during a flu pandemic -- not the illness itself -- would shave 1.9% off world GDP. Some poorer parts of the world would lose 2.9% of GDP.</p>
<p>Ironically, because wealth translates into health, poorer nations could well lose far more lives to the hysteria than the virus. Such are the wages of our swine flu fright fest.</p>

</p>
<p>Alberta pork exports and a Quebec student exchange program became the latest casualties of swine flu fears in China yesterday.</p>
<p>Although no cases of H1N1 flu have been reported in mainland China - except for one Mexican hotel guest who tested positive - about 300 tourists were put under a seven-day quarantine this weekend, including 25 Université de Montréal students learning Mandarin.</p>
<p>Chinese health authorities stopped the group Sunday upon their arrival in Changchun airport in the northern province of Jilin.</p>
<p>Although none exhibited flu symptoms and none had a fever, they were bused to a university dormitory and told not to leave.</p>
<p>"My first reaction was: 'Oh no, it's just us.' It seemed an extreme reaction," said David Ownby, director of the Centre for East-Asian Studies at Université de Montréal.</p>
<p>"It's a pain for the students, but they are lucky that they didn't get turned back at the border."</p>
<p>There are more than 1,000 cases of H1N1 flu in 18 countries, the World Health Organization reported yesterday.</p>
<p>Canada has recorded more than 140 - the third-highest number of cases after the United States and Mexico, which is considered the epicentre of the outbreak.</p>
<p>Cases in Mexico have plateaued, health officials there said yesterday.</p>
<p>Quebec's tally remained steady yesterday at three confirmed cases, said Alain Poirier, director of Quebec's Public Health Department.</p>
<p>All infected patients have recovered, Poirier said.</p>
<p>"Extraordinary measures like closing airports, closing borders, closing schools and other institutions seems out of proportion" with the actual threat, Poirier said.</p>
<p>"What are we going to tell everyone, 'Stay home?' "</p>
<p>But the Université de Montréal students were told China isn't taking any chances.</p>
<p>Maxime Paradiso, 22, of Montreal, posted an image of himself on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> sporting the ubiquitous face mask on the bus to the dormitory.</p>
<p>Reached yesterday in Montreal, Paradiso's girlfriend, Jessica Authier, said she had "spoken" to him via computer.</p>
<p>The flight to Beijing was uneventful, but everything changed once they got into Jilin, she said: "They had masks put on them and they were taken to (Northeast Normal University), put on the ground level but they couldn't go outside - not at all."</p>
<p>Jilin health authorities and university officials moved the students to a small hotel the next day; they're being provided with meals.</p>
<p>"It's nice that they're all together and that they are allowed to go outside into a backyard area," Authier said, adding that the yard has goats and chickens.</p>
<p>Authier said she peppered Paradiso with emails and questions: What's it like? What do you do all day? Is school postponed? Will classes be held in the hotel?</p>
<p>But their Internet access isn't good, she said. He wrote that he was bored.</p>
<p>"He said it was really boring, which it's going to be, imagine you just got into China and you can't go anywhere, you can't start this great experience," Authier said. "So they're counting the days until it's over."</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said in the House of Commons yesterday that he has directed consular officials to check in on the students.</p>
<p>Dr. Keiji Fukuda, acting assistant director-general of Health Security and Environment at the World Health Organization, said yesterday that there's no set recipe and that each country handles disease control measures in its own fashion.</p>
<p>As for the pork industry, Michel Doré, an official with Quebec's Civil Security Department, said biosecurity surveillance and measures will be enforced, for example, pig farm workers washing their shoes and changing clothes to protect the pig population from getting the flu.</p>
<p>"I repeat, there's no danger in consuming pork, providing it's well cooked," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pick up some pork, Ritz urges Canadians -</b>
</div><div>By Larry Kusch   </div>

</p>
<p>THE federal agriculture minister wants Canadians to help out hog producers who are suffering a market downturn in the wake of an international outbreak of H1N1 flu -- also called swine flu.</p>
<p>"We are encouraging Canadian families to support struggling hog producers by picking up some pork next time they go to the grocery store," Gerry Ritz said in a statement Monday, following news that hogs on an Alberta farm had caught the virus from a farmhand who had been to Mexico.</p>
<p>It was a message reminiscent of the rallying cry in support of beef producers during the mad cow crisis in 2003, when many countries closed their borders to Canadian products.</p>
<p>Manitoba hog producers are worried that a nervous public will shy away from eating pork despite assurances from local, national and international health agencies that humans can't get the H1N1 flu strain from eating pork products.</p>
<p>"The issue is uncertainty," said Andrew Dickson, general manager of the Manitoba Pork Council, an industry lobby group, noting that a number of foreign markets have already banned North American pork because of the flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Hog producers saw prices fall by $10 to $20 a pig in recent days before word got out that the virus had spread to an Alberta swine farm. On Monday, American cash prices tumbled, in part because of the Alberta case, Dickson said.</p>
<p>So far, only three of Canada's top 15 export customers have put restrictions on Canadian pork, said Martin Rice, executive director of the Canadian Pork Council. Ukraine and the Philippines have barred Canadian products, while South Korea has begun lengthy tests on all shipments.</p>
<p>The news is much better here at home, where a local spokesman for Canada <span class="companylink">Safeway</span> said the company has not changed its buying practices in light of the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"We haven't adjusted ordering or seen any decrease in sales," said John Graham.</p>

</p>
<p>Classes were in session, but close to a third of the students stayed away Monday from the Brandon school attended by Manitoba's first H1N1 flu victim.</p>
<p>Brandon School Division superintendent Donna Michaels said around 90 out of 320 students stayed home from Riverheights School, a kindergarten to Grade 8 school in the western Manitoba city.</p>
<p>That works out to an absentee rate of about 28 per cent, compared to a normal rate of eight to 10 per cent.</p>
<p>"Given the circumstances, I'm not alarmed," said Michaels. "Neither am I surprised."</p>
<p>A girl who attends Riverheights has a mild case of the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, the first and only reported case in Manitoba to date.</p>
<p>Provincial health officials have said the girl travelled to Mexico, the United States and British Columbia in mid to late April, but did not need to be hospitalized. Health officials have said there is no need for the school to be closed.</p>
<p>Classes in Brandon would only be called off if there was a serious risk of contagion, said Michaels, and the division looks to Manitoba Health for that information.</p>
<p>"They are the professional health-care givers, and we're the professional educators," she said. "We must rely on and respect their judgment in these matters."</p>
<p>On Monday, the province clarified its protocol for closing any school due to an outbreak of influenza. It said that such closures would be directed by the education minister after consultation with the chief provincial public health officer or a regional medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Dr. Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief provincial public health officer, said the government was reacting to a case outside Manitoba where a school had been closed without the advice of a public health officer -- and the anticipation that similar pressures might be placed on schools here.</p>
<p>"At this point in time, to my knowledge and to the knowledge of all of our regional medical officers of health, there is no indication for public health reasons to close any schools in Manitoba," he said.</p>
<p>Kettner said no additional confirmed cases of H1N1 flu have been reported in the province although it's expected that more cases have occurred and will occur.</p>
<p>"Although it's looking more and more with every passing day that this H1N1 influenza is not as severe as some people feared it might be ... it's too early to draw that conclusion," he said.</p>
<p>Kettner said like other flu strains, individuals can reduce the likelihood of transmitting H1N1 by washing their hands and covering their cough. As well, they can cut down the chance of developing a severe illness from the flu by generally taking care of their health, such as eating right, getting enough sleep and exercise and taking care of chronic health conditions they may have.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all schools in the Brandon division are set to remain open for the week.</p>
<p>Principals from around the Brandon School Division met Monday to talk about the division's emergency response plans. Michaels said there was some concern from Riverheights teachers about how far the flu might have spread, or how the student in question might be received by her classmates when she returns to school.</p>
<p>Michaels believes absent students will begin coming back by Wednesday.</p>

</p>
<p>Mexico was preparing yesterday to reopen many businesses and tourist sites closed by its swine flu epidemic after officials said the H1N1 virus, which has killed 26 people in the country, looked to be under control.</p>
<p>But Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova warned that while it appeared "the trend is slowing" for the epidemic, "there could be a resurgence, and that could occur in the next few days or even much later."</p>
<p>Lab tests on hundreds of suspect cases revealed four more deaths, bringing the total to 26.</p>
<p>The government and authorities in Mexico City - where most of the fatalities and infections occurred - said that from tomorrow they would start reopening venues closed nearly a week ago to prevent contagion.</p>
<p>Restaurants and other eateries would open first, followed by museums and religious centres on Thursday, said the capital's deputy mayor, Jose Avila. Nightclubs, cinemas and theatres were to remain closed until further notice, he added.</p>
<p>The easing of restrictions was welcomed by Mexicans, most of whom were spending a five-day holiday weekend at home, either at the urging of President Felipe Calderon or because no activities were available.</p>
<p>The hospitality sector in the capital said the closing of indoor entertainment places was costing the economy $100 million a day and putting 450,000 jobs at risk.</p>
<p>In the United States, the number of confirmed cases of swine flu continued to rise, with health authorities saying 286 people in 36 states were infected with the virus. Nearly two-thirds of the confirmed cases were in people under the age of 18.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention predicted yesterday that the virus will continue to spread globally and become a pandemic, but ruled out the need to mass produce a vaccine.</p>
<p>Global health officials should instead keep a close eye on how the swine flu virus evolves in the southern hemisphere, which is just beginning its winter flu season, acting CDC head Richard Besser said.</p>
<p>He added that the flu might mutate, making a vaccine useless.</p>

</p>
<p>A young Edmonton child was in intensive care yesterday with the first known case of severe illness related to human swine influenza in Canada.</p>
<p>The child has no known connection to Mexico, and federal health officials said yesterday they did not know whether the girl had any underlying medical conditions that would increase her risk of flu-related complications.</p>
<p>"We are starting to see some community-based spread," said David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>Until now, all confirmed cases in Canada have been relatively mild, and all have made a full recovery.</p>
<p>"The news of this first, more severe case, although disconcerting, is not surprising, and it does not change the course of action that we are taking," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>He said more cases of swine flu, with varying levels of severity, will be uncovered, and the rogue virus is following the pattern of normal, seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>"This case underscores a couple of things about influenza. It has few boundaries. It doesn't respect borders. It often doesn't respect age. Nature is very unpredictable, as is the influenza virus," Butler-Jones said. "Even with regular seasonal flu, we see people get very ill. We on occasion also see young, otherwise healthy people get very ill, or die. It is a very, very serious disease. It takes its toll on people young and old. So we need to stay vigilant."</p>
<p>A total of 41 new confirmed cases of H1N1 flu virus were reported in Canada yesterday, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 140. The new cases include 10 in B.C., six in Alberta, 17 in Ontario, including a 4-year-old child, one in New Brunswick, five in Nova Scotia and two in Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p>The Edmonton girl is in stable condition in a hospital after contracting the disease, although it is not clear where she picked it up, since she wasn't travelling.</p>
<p>The New Brunswick case, the province's second, involved a woman in her 40s from the Fredericton area who has already recovered. Both cases in P.E.I. were mild, according to the P.E.I. Department of Health. Neither case was hospitalized.</p>
<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is asking staff who may have travelled on official government business in the past 30 days to countries with human swine flu or had contact with animals "that they declare that upon return" to Canada, said Brian Evans, Canada's chief veterinary officer.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said work on developing a vaccine continues, as well as genetic typing to get a clearer picture of the virus.</p>

</p>
<p>(From the Vancouver Sun, May 6, 2009) An Air Canada seat sale to Jamaica ended April 30. Incorrect information appeared in a story on page A3 on May 5. ***** </p>
<p>The price of travel to sunny destinations is skyrocketing as travellers steer clear of Mexico.</p>
<p>Mandy Hufford and her boyfriend had each paid $997 for a one-week all-inclusive vacation to Cabo San Lucas leaving May 10. But they were told by their travel agent they would have to change plans after Air Canada announced Friday it is cancelling flights to Mexico, excluding Mexico City.</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon, Hufford's travel agent e-mailed her options for vacations in Jamaica, the Bahamas or Dominican Republic, which Hufford was told would cost between $400 and $1,100 per person in addition to what she had already paid. But when Hufford replied Friday morning saying she wanted to book the $400 Jamaica option, her travel agent said Air Canada had raised their prices overnight to sunny destinations -- almost double on some routes. Instead of $400, it would cost at least $900 extra to go to Jamaica.</p>
<p>Shawna Zeck, general manager of Jubilee Travel, said the price increase is the result of an Air Canada seat sale that ended Monday. "It had nothing to do with the travel advisory," she said. "Regardless of what would have happened with the advisory, prices still would have changed today."</p>
<p>But Air Canada spokeswoman Angela Mah said they're simply pricing to the market. "Pricing for air travel is dynamic, and it changes on a regular basis based on market forces -- supply and demand," said Mah.</p>
<p>Travellers have been rushing to change their vacations as a result of the swine flu. "Anybody that was looking to go to Mexico is shifting their travel ideas to Jamaica, the Bahamas, Cuba, the Dominican Republic..." Zeck said.</p>
<p>In addition to increased demand for non-Mexican sunny destinations, supply is also down. Dale Urquhart, director of travel services for BCAA, said May is usually a quiet time for sunny destinations. That means airlines offer fewer flights.</p>
<p>"We've come off of a soft winter where we saw extremely low prices, and now the capacity has reduced significantly from May onwards," she said. "So the pricing looks like it's gone up significantly higher, but it's what normally happens when the capacity gets reduced and there's less competition."</p>
<p>Lorraine Bullock, product manager of travel insurance for BCAA, also had travel plans destroyed by the swine flu. She had booked a vacation for 21 family members in Mexico this month. Her family members who purchased travel insurance are taking their money back or making alternate arrangements. But her family members without travel insurance haven't been able to get a refund.</p>

<p>Edmonton --</p>
<p>An Alberta girl – who is so far still the only Canadian to be hospitalized with swine flu symptoms – continues to recover in an Edmonton area hospital, according to Dr. Andre Corriveau, the province's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>“Her condition is improving,” he told reporters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>There is a lot of public confusion about the seriousness of her illness after the federal and Alberta governments gave out conflicting information earlier this week about her case.</p>
<p>Federal officials, including Health Minister Leona Aqlukkaq, told reporters on Monday that she was being treated in intensive care and was the country's first severe case of swine flu.</p>
<p>“I didn't hear what the federal minister said,” Dr. Corriveau said on Tuesday morning, adding his office is the only “source of information on Alberta cases – no one else.”</p>
<p>He said when provincial health officials originally told the public about the girl's illness on Monday, they still weren't sure what “role” swine flu played in her overall condition and need for hospitalization. “We didn't know her complete story at the time.”</p>
<p>Dr. Corriveau said on Tuesday that when she was hospitalized on April 30 that the “prime reason was the swine flu.”</p>
<p>He refused to classify her case as severe but did explain she does not require ventilation. All the other cases found in Alberta so far have been reported as mild.</p>
<p>“It was more severe than other cases,” was all Dr. Corriveau would say when pressed by reporters.</p>
<p>Provincial health investigators are still searching for clues about how the girl contracted swine flu. She has no known connection to Mexico where A H1N1 virus originated.</p>
<p>In total, Alberta has 26 swine flu cases. Two new cases were reported on Tuesday – both were found in Calgary. One involved a young boy whose parents recently returned from Mexico.</p>
<p>In Ontario, Ottawa and the Halton region reported its first cases of the new virus today. There are 36 cases in the province.</p>
<p>David Williams, Ontario's Acting Chief Medical Officer of Health, said all the cases are mild and none of the people have been hospitalized. Two of the confirmed cases in Ontario are not related to travel; they became infected through contact with someone who travelled to Mexico, Dr. Williams said.</p>
<p>In Canada, there are 142 confirmed cases of the virus.</p>
<p>The Alberta government revealed on Tuesday that the hospitalized girl is school-aged. Alberta Education Minister Dave Hancock said government officials have already been in contact with the school board involved and there are no plans to even publicly disclose which school she attends.</p>
<p>“The information we are given is that this is not a circumstance where it is necessary to inform others in the school. At this point, there is not an indication of risk,” he said.</p>
<p>Alberta Liberal Leader David Swann raised questions in the legislature about why the Tory government is releasing scant details about the girl's case, which has attracted international media attention.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Minister Ron Liepert responded that the “level of information being released is appropriate.”</p>

<div>1230 words</div><div>5 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Six new human cases of the H1N1 flu virus have been discovered in Alberta, including one young girl who is the first patient in Canada to be hospitalized with the illness.</p>
<p>"One young girl was admitted to one of our hospitals with a more severe form of illness that is currently under care and is doing well," said Dr. Andre Corriveau, the province's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"It's the first time we've had a case that requires hospitalization. All of the other cases we've had so far, which has been the pattern around the world outside of Mexico, have been mild."</p>
<p>But Corriveau said the H1N1 virus sickens people to varying degrees, like all influenza strains.</p>
<p>Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services, said there are many reasons why flu affects people differently. Existing health conditions such as asthma or heart problems can lead to hospitalization, as can development of pneumonia.</p>
<p>"It's certainly not unexpected," Predy said of the girl's hospitalization. "It is behaving like normal, seasonal influenza."</p>
<p>The girl, whose age and hometown were not released, has been in an Edmonton hospital since April 30. She is in stable condition.</p>
<p>So far, investigators haven't been able to find any connection between the girl and Mexico, where the virus originated, but are still looking.</p>
<p>The other five new Alberta cases were all young adults who are recovering at home, which describes the majority of the 24 cases the province has seen so far. Three of the new cases are from central Alberta and two are in Calgary. Four of those cases could be connected to time spent in Mexico.</p>
<p>All 24 Alberta patients have been under 42 years of age. Only a fraction of those cases are still active, Corriveau said.</p>
<p>Authorities will not say if the girl is school age because of privacy reasons. "We're not anticipating any closure of schools," Predy said</p>
<p>Across the city, day cares and school boards have taken extra precautions against infected students coming to class.</p>
<p>Day cares across the province have a standard policy that children who are too sick to participate in activities are separated and monitored until a parent can pick them up.</p>
<p>Whether any stronger precautions are employed during the outbreak is up to individual centres.</p>
<p>At the Centre Daycare at Telus Plaza, director Gloria Zelli said the policy has recently been tightened.</p>
<p>Children are still sent home if they show signs of sickness, but now need a doctor's note when they return to prove they aren't carrying the swine flu virus. Before, Zelli said, not all returning children had to have a note.</p>
<p>Zelli also sent letters home to parents with all the information they needed. "We always keep a close eye on children's health, but now we're communicating with parents more," she said.</p>
<p>At Edmonton public schools, a note reminding any student with flu symptoms to stay home is taped to every door. The school board is also holding meetings to determine if any further measures should be taken, said spokeswoman Jane Farrell.</p>
<p>Catholic schools sent letters home encouraging parents to monitor their children's health and keep them home if any symptoms appeared.</p>
<p>As summer vacations approach, Corriveau said no one needs to change their plans.</p>
<p>"It's no more of a concern right now than it might have been in the past. When we travel, we can bring germs somewhere else or bring them back. The general advice is still valid. At this point, people can maintain their holiday plans."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 25 Canadian students and their teacher from the University of Montreal, in China to study Mandarin, have been placed under quarantine in northern China for seven days as a precaution against swine flu.</p>
<p>Provincial health authorities stopped the group Sunday upon their arrival in Changchun airport in the province of Jilin.</p>
<p>They had their temperatures taken at the airport and then were bused to a university dormitory. None of the students is reported to have fever.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Canadian consular officers are in contact with the students "to ensure they are well cared for and have access to consular assistance."</p>
<p>She said officials are in contact with local Chinese authorities and will travel Tuesday to meet with the students. "Consular officials have already spoken with members of the group by phone and they report they are being well treated," she said.</p>
<p>While the new H1N1 strain is not food-borne, 20 countries worldwide had banned imports of pork as of Monday in response to the discovery of the H1N1 flu strain in a herd of pigs on a central Alberta hog farm.</p>
<p>Federal officials believe the infected pigs on a central Alberta farm -- the first known case of humans transferring the new strain into animals -- contracted the virus from a Canadian worker who returned from Mexico on April 12 and arrived on the farm two days later, showing flu symptoms shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Both the worker and the approximately 220 infected pigs are recovering, but the animals have been quarantined, say officials.</p>
<p>Global trade in pork is worth about $26 billion a year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, scientists are learning how the new strain is behaving compared to normal seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Where influenza normally has an incubation period of up to five days, human swine flu appears to incubate for up to eight days.</p>
<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is asking staff who may have travelled on official government business in the past 30 days to countries with human swine flu or had contact with animals "that they declare that upon return" to Canada, Dr. Brian Evans, Canada's chief veterinary officer said.</p>
<p>A total of 41 new confirmed cases of H1N1 flu virus were reported across Canada on Monday, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 140. The new cases include 10 in B.C., 17 in Ontario, including a four-year-old child, one in New Brunswick, five in Nova Scotia and two in Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization said the number of global cases stands at 1,085 from 21 countries, including 26 deaths.</p>
<p>So far, human swine flu appears to have a longer than normal incubation period, causes diarrhea in about half of those it infects and can lead to severe pneumonia and deaths in young, healthy people, WHO officials said Monday.</p>
<p>But it is still not known how often it leads to severe disease. A 21-month-old toddler from Mexico who died in Houston remains the only death in the United States so far.</p>
<p>WHO is one step away from calling the swine flu outbreaks a pandemic.</p>
<p>Last week it raised its alert level to Phase 5 on a six-phase scale. The change was meant as a signal that a pandemic is likely imminent and that countries should activate their pandemic preparedness plans. But officials said Monday they had no immediate plans to go to Phase 6.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Year to forget on Cinco de Mayo</b>
</div><div>The Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>760 words</div><div>5 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Many Canadians and Americans assume today -- Cinco de Mayo -- is Mexico's national holiday. But that's just another misconception widely held by its closest neighbours. In fact, this day isn't even a statutory national holiday, but largely a regional one in a republic that loves to commemorate and party. Independence Day -- the country's most important patriotic event -- is celebrated on the 16th of September each year with impressive gusto and sustained commercial activity.</p>
<p>Instead, May 5th marks the 1862 defeat of the French army in the Battle of Puebla by a vastly out-manned, under-equipped Mexican force led by General Ignacio Zaragosa Seguin and his calvary officer Porfirio Diaz.</p>
<p>In the state of Puebla, where the battlefield on the outskirts of the gorgeous provincial capital of the same name is a national shrine, Cinco de Mayo is certainly a major holiday. But for reasons not entirely clear, the day has also developed into a sort of national pride day -- similar to Oktoberfest or St. Patrick's Day -- for Mexicans and those of Mexican descent living outside the mother country, particularly the U.S.</p>
<p>Even in Canada, where Spanish-speaking residents from elsewhere outnumber Mexicans, restaurants, shops, grocery stores and bars have discovered the sweet possibilities of promoting pinatas, posole and Pacificos during the first week of May. After all, via increased trade and tourism, we draw ever closer to our fellow North Americans south of the U.S. border each year, a good thing for all concerned.</p>
<p>This year, however, present-day circumstances will not be contributing much to Cinco de Mayo good cheer. If Mexico had a monarch -- something it hasn't had since Benito Juarez relieved the hapless Emperor Maximilian I of his worldly cares in 1867 -- he or she would be understating it when pronouncing (as did ours in 1992) the past 12 months as annus horribilis.</p>
<p>First, of course, Mexicans are sharing with the rest of the world an economic downturn they had little to do with causing. Like Canada's, Mexico's fortunes are very much determined by the financial health and political proclivities of the U.S. Commodity prices -- especially on the petroleum and mining side -- have not been moving in Mexico's favour, another dependency it shares with us. Agricultural markets have been unstable. And of course, all of this is exacerbated by the fact that, for all its achievements and sophistication, Mexico is still home to far too many desperately poor people. When the exchange rate falls by 40 per cent, you know who will get hurt first and most deeply.</p>
<p>Then -- long before the first flu victim was reported -- tourism and the country's reputation across the board has been rocked by the real and perceived threats of violence associated with drug gangs. It doesn't matter that these troubles are far from the beaches of the Yucatan -- "bad press" is bad press. Add to that the occasional, isolated murder of a foreigner, tour bus crashes, well-publicized stories of shakedowns by corrupt police and even an earthquake, and you begin to appreciate the depth of the bad news Mexicans have had to deal with of late.</p>
<p>Never mind that cities such as Edmonton are statistically more violent than many similar-sized communities in Mexico, especially resorts. Or that the swine flu toll may turn out to be smaller than advertised, and in decline. Forget the fact that without a market in the U.S. and Canada, the murderous narcos wouldn't have much of a business.</p>
<p>For all its potential and practised world-weariness, it may well take Mexico years to recover from the body blows it has been dealt over the past year. But humour, faith, resignation, shared history, a profound sense of the ancient national paradox will no doubt see Mexicans through the current affliciones.</p>
<p>Darkly, they will remember that less than a year after the Cinco de Mayo victory, the French came back in full force, invaded Mexico City and installed a European emperor. Later, following Maximilian's demise, battlefield hero Porfirio Diaz installed himself as gold-dipped dictator and would-be president for life.</p>
<p>Mexico got past those events, of course -- and will again. But any Canadians feeling sorry for themselves might well look south to get a grip on the size of our problems. As we figuratively spill out the contents of a festive pinata today, may the bounty be better luck for our long-suffering friends down Mexico way.</p>

<p>Influenza - Two-thirds of corporate travel managers say workers at their companies are cancelling trips to Mexico because of the H1N1 flu outbreak, according to a trade group's survey.</p>
<p>In the survey of 113 managers, 16 per cent of those who responded also estimated they've lost more than $50,000 US worth of business opportunities because of such cancellations, in addition to any fees they've had to pay, the U. S. National Business Travel Association said Monday in a statement.</p>
<p>About a third of respondents said cancellation and change fees and loss of business cost them less than $500, indicating the financial effect can "vary widely from company to company," the Alexandria, Va.-based group said.</p>
<p>The survey is an attempt to quantify the expense to businesses of the H1N1 outbreak.</p>

<p>If a glance to the sky doesn't tell you a tornado is approaching, a text message on your cellphone might in the near future.</p>
<p>After 14 years of beaming emergency alerts about extreme weather or -- more recently -- child abductions on TV and radio stations, the Alberta government is looking to go 21st century with the power to send notices to cellphones, satellite radio and Internet users.</p>
<p>"<span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Twitter are on our radar screen, as well as being able to block in on Internet," said Municipal Affairs Minister Ray Danyluk, who's responsible for the provincial emergency management agency.</p>
<p>"There's technologies out there that for sure we don't understand --or myself, (I) don't understand --but there's potential and we want to make sure that we're ahead of technology," said Danyluk.</p>
<p>Canada's public health agency and the World Health Organization have been using social-media website Twitter to give up-to-theminute updates on the H1N1 influenza outbreak.</p>
<p>But Twitter junkies or behind-the-times folks will only see those news flashes if they voluntarily visit or subscribe to feeds.</p>
<p>Alberta proposes going a step further and using Internet pop-ups or other forced interruptions to get messages out about floods or tornadoes, and text-messages on mobile phones.</p>
<p>Between 1998 and July 2008, the government issued 37 public warnings about floods, boil-water advisories, severe storms or 911-system failures-- 19 of the alerts to the Calgary region. It issued six Amber Alerts about abducted youth.</p>
<p>It's wise to try flagging the attention of the increasing numbers of Albertans who have tuned out traditional broadcast media and get information elsewhere, said Patrick Perri, a computer science instructor at Mount Royal College.</p>
<p>But he warned it's costly to get private telecommunications firms to set up notification systems to alert thousands or millions of users.</p>
<p>"Might we have to attach a 911-type fee?" Perri asked.</p>
<p>Because Internet users cherish their ability to choose what to view, a government intrusion won't likely be welcomed much, he cautioned.</p>
<p>It's an extension of our desire to control what we see, Perri said. "If our culture is headed this way, this system is fraught with danger."</p>
<p>The modernized warning program won't start until mid-2010.The government issued Monday an unusually broad public request for bids to create the new system, inviting companies to come up with alert networks that could cover the broadest ranges of new technologies.</p>
<p>When Alberta set up Canada's first provincewide warning system in 1994, not only was social media a non-existent term, BlackBerry was still just a fruit, satellite dishes were massive and cellphones weren't common, Danyluk said.</p>
<p>"We need to know how they are communicating and we need to know how to warn people," he said.</p>
<p>The University of Calgary and University of Alberta both collect student cellphone numbers to send them emergency notifications.</p>
<p>During severe snowstorms in B. C. in 2006,Telus voluntarily text-messaged critical information to all its mobile customers. It has also been tapped by the B. C. government to be ready to send tsunami warnings to all coastal residents no matter which phone service they use, Telus spokesman Shawn Hall said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>First case spread to pig from human; Alberta carpenter just returned from Mexico</b>
</div><div>Ben Gelinas   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>234 words</div><div>5 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>The carpenter who spread swine flu to pigs while working in a barn on a central Alberta farm had just returned from Mexico, where he was helping to build a church, chief provincial veterinarian Gerald Hauer said.</p>
<p>The man was so ill with the flu that he had to go home early on April 14. The H1N1 virus is believed to have lingered in the barn, spreading through the 2,200 pigs in the herd much as it spreads among people: The carpenter either came into contact with an animal or touched something a pig then touched.</p>
<p>The provincial veterinarian's office was notified about the infected pigs 14 days after the animals were exposed to the carpenter. But officials say they were "promptly" told about the sick pigs once media reports circulated about human swine flu cases in Canada.</p>
<p>It is the first time H1N1 --a particular strain of influenza that emerged last month in Mexico -- is believed to have spread to pigs from a human, Hauer said.</p>
<p>The farm was still under quarantine Monday as the Canadian Food Inspection Agency studied a sample of the virus collected from the pigs. The identity of the carpenter and a more specific location of the farm are being withheld.</p>

</p>
<p>The Edmonton girl in hospital with a serious case of H1N1 flu virus does go to school, and all measures are being taken to notify others who might be affected, including the school.</p>
<p>Big news? Nowhere but in Alberta. Here, it's like pulling teeth to get even that much information via unnamed sources. The province appears to have a unique swine flu symptom--it strikes officials mute.</p>
<p>We may not know the girl's age. That might tend to identify her (although it's a mystery how, in an urban area of one million people).</p>
<p>We are first told that she has a severe case of the flu by Dr. Andre Corriveau, the province's public health boss.</p>
<p>When that plain fact is quickly reported, however, something like official panic ensues.</p>
<p>We're next informed that she may have other complications, and it's too early to conclude she was hospitalized because of the flu.</p>
<p>But authorities can't confirm that she actually does have other complications, even though she's been in hospital since April 30.</p>
<p>Why can't they say? Because that might identify the girl.</p>
<p>It starts to sound like a Monty Python skit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ontario quickly revealed that a girl with the flu is four years old. In Mexico, a CNN crew was allowed into a hospital to report that things aren't so bad after all. Alberta seems uniquely vague about this problem.</p>
<p>The trouble is, there comes a point when protecting privacy starts to look like secrecy. And secrecy is scary when the subject is a new illness.</p>
<p>The daily tap dancing around the facts is remarkable.</p>
<p>When officials give us a new count of flu victims, they reveal only gender and general location.</p>
<p>Except for Edmonton and Calgary, communities are never named. No individual ages are revealed.</p>
<p>This is supposed to protect privacy, as if somebody might say, "Aha! You're a 38-year-old man --you've got SWINE FLU!"</p>
<p>The real reason for the secrecy, one suspects, is not protection of privacy but fear of panic.</p>
<p>The authorities don't want schools, communities or neighbourhoods identified, especially in small centres. They live in terror that a camera crew will find that little girl's hospital room.</p>
<p>By any rational measure, this flu isn't a big deal. Only 24 people have been sickened in a province of 3.5 million. Just one of those is in hospital. There is no mutant killer strain of the virus.</p>
<p>The only way to make this problem look big, in fact, is to drape it in mystery. That's exactly what our officials are doing. It will backfire badly if the flu takes a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>Mexican authorities have been much more open, and it's working.</p>
<p>"The Mexican response has been swift and direct," says Jim Stanton, a Canadian crisis communications expert who happens to be vacationing in Puerto Vallarta.</p>
<p>"The president came on national TV and radio and gave Mexicans an update, state by state, on the number of confirmed cases.</p>
<p>"On Monday, they brought a CNN crew into the Mexican Navy Hospital and let them tape what was going on.</p>
<p>"Viewers saw and heard that there were very few new cases and those that were discovered were being treated quickly."</p>
<p>"I'd say they've done an excellent job," adds Stanton, who works with agencies and municipalities all over Canada.</p>
<p>So why the big mystery here? That's a riddle in itself; but if it continues, public trust will start to erode.</p>

<p>Pork producers in Canada and the U. S. are already seeing a loss of $10 to $20 per animal, due directly to the immediate market reactions to the originally named swine flu outbreak in Mexico last month, said Jurgen Preugschas, president of the Canadian Pork Council.</p>
<p>With China now banning Alberta pork specificaly, and more than a dozen countries banning Canadian pork and live hogs, the worry is how Canada's export-dependent industry is going to fare should the situation snowball out of control.</p>
<p>Japan and the U. S., Canada and Alberta's biggest customers, aren't on the ban list, but hog farmer Jason Lenz is still worried. The Bentley, Alta., hog farmer called China's ban reactionary and unwarranted because the decision isn't based on science.</p>
<p>"The biggest concern would be no matter how long that market stays closed to us, it's just one less market for us to export our product to, and the other concern is that other countries might follow suit and do the same," he said from his swine farm, where he has 1,500 hogs.</p>
<p>John Middel, a hog farmer from Rocky Mountain House, said he's apprehensive about the future and others are too.</p>
<p>People are wondering what this means now, he said.</p>
<p>"It's totally unknown what's going to happen, it's just hard to say how it will unravel. But already prices have been significantly hit,"Middel said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency quarantined all 2,200 animals on the central Alberta farm, after they were exposed to the H1N1 virus by a worker.</p>
<p>The Canadian worker, also a carpenter, had gone to Mexico to help build a church, and returned to work on the pig farm. It's the first time the H1N1 influenza A strain has been found in pigs.</p>
<p>In a press conference Monday, Preugschas again called the bans a knee-jerk reaction, given H1N1 influenza A isn't a food safety issue, but one of human health.</p>
<p>"It's very unfortunate be-cause our producers, our processors and our packers are taking the brunt of it, and it's costing our industry dearly after what we've already gone through of severe economic times in the last three years," he said. Even if countries haven't banned Canadian pork, traders report that some orders are being cancelled, Preugschas added.</p>
<p>"The stock-markets are driven by the unknown. This type of thing is also driven by the unknown, and even though we're quite comfortable that pork is very safe, the hype has made it an unknown quantity," he said.</p>
<p>Rod Scarlett, executive director of Wild Rose Agricultural Producers, said the bans have far reaching implications for everybody involved in the agriculture industry.The price of grains and oilseeds for feed all went down along with hog prices, he said.</p>
<p>"It has an impact on international trade for all commodities, because if we have countries like China closing the border on non-scientific based matters, the implication is it can occur for anything -- for the next shipload of barley headed for China," Scarlett said.</p>
<p>Alberta's pork exports were worth $342.1 million in 2008, with China accounting for just $4.4 million. Alberta's pork exports to Japan were $169.7 million, followed by the U. S. at $55.6 million and South Korea at $31.1 million. Nearly all Alberta's live hog exports go to the U. S., worth $50 million in 2008.</p>
<p>In question period Monday, federal Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz warned that the government could pursue World Trade Organization action if China doesn't end its ban.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Is flu threat blown out of proportion?</b>
</div><div>Theresa Storm   </div>
<div>For The Calgary Herald</div>

</p>
<p>L ate Friday night, to the relief of frantic family and friends, I arrived home in Calgary from Acapulco, Mexico, two days later than scheduled</p>
<p>In years of travels, this was the first time I was too close for my family's comfort to "danger"--the Mexico City epicentre of the growing international swine flu (H1N1) crisis.</p>
<p>Although I reassured them Acapulco reported no flu outbreak and life continued normally with some precautions, the near-hysteria at home led to the last-minute decision to cancel my return flight Wednesday via Mexico City and the stress of finding another way out.</p>
<p>My uncertain return journey -- one of scores made as a travel journalist--began as an ordinary business trip from Calgary to Mexico to attend Tianguis, the country's large annual travel trade show.</p>
<p>It soon became extraordinary.</p>
<p>When I left home April 22, swine flu was not yet in our lexicon, so a four-hour connection through bustling Mexico City was an inconvenience, not a concern.</p>
<p>It was not until the opening of Tianguis on April 26, that I first heard the word "flu." No one seemed overly concerned, including the just-arrived Canadians that saw no need to stay home despite the outbreak.</p>
<p>Monday a handful of delegates appeared in masks, but it was business as usual, pausing only when Acapulco was rocked by a 5.6 earthquake, which scared me much more than the flu threat.</p>
<p>By Tuesday afternoon, however, a flood of announcements including Canada's travel warning, airline, tour, and cruise ship cancellations began to make me, and three other Canadians, nervous about going through the epicentre. The rest said they were not concerned.</p>
<p>itravel2000, on-site at the show, checked into options but were unable to find a flight within days to Calgary, so I decided to fly home as planned. Two others changed their flights.</p>
<p>That night, my husband, fuelled by media reports and worried about the flu's possible implications for my existing lymphatic disorder, implored me not to board my scheduled flight mere hours later.</p>
<p>Everything was closed. There was nowhere to turn for help. Even the hotel Internet did not work. Although I was worried about how and when I would get home, I cancelled.</p>
<p>My stress rose Wednesday as I learned almost all flights from Acapulco go through Mexico City, and there is no bus service to beach destinations like Puerto Vallarta, where WestJet was adding flights.</p>
<p>Numerous phone calls resulted in securing a seat on a previously full flight two days hence to Houston -- a major relief.</p>
<p>Friday I arrived at the airport too early, unsure of what awaited there and later on de-planing in the U. S. and finally at home.</p>
<p>Would everything be normal? Would our temperatures be taken?Would we receive a medical exam?Would we be quarantined?</p>
<p>Although on previous days, masks were handed out at the airport, they no longer were. Nor in Mexico City, colleagues report.</p>
<p>A new procedure implemented that morning by Mexico's federal government required passengers to answer a flu-symptom questionnaire and present it to a doctor for a stamp before checking in.</p>
<p>Some airport workers were wearing masks, but a Continental gate agent advised the airline asked its staff not to.</p>
<p>Still unsure, I and some other passengers purchased $2 masks from the airport's pharmacy, which I donned until clearing U. S. Customs in Houston, where all was normal.</p>
<p>The Calgary Customs officer simply asked if I had flu symptoms and gave me a Health Canada notice for arriving Mexico passengers.</p>
<p>Although I took precautions and am concerned, I cannot help but wonder if the H1N1 threat has been blown out of proportion. It is bringing Mexico's key tourism industry to a grinding halt, hurting its workers and the economy, maybe needlessly.</p>

<p>Hector Reynoso</p>
<p>Soccer</p>
<p>The Mexican footballer has been banned for spitting and blowing nasal secretions at an opponent then telling him he had swine flu.</p>
<p>Guadalajara defender Reynoso has provisionally been suspended from all matches in the Libertadores Cup following last week's game at Everton of Chile in South America's top club competition.</p>
<p>The South American Football Confederation (CSF) said the length of the ban would be determined in the next 72 hours.</p>
<p>"At around the 90th minute of the aforementioned game, Reynoso, following an incident in the game, reacted by spitting at Everton player Sebastian Penco and then releasing nasal secretions at the face of the player," said the CSF in a statement.</p>
<p>"This situation, lamentable in its own right, was aggravated by the risk of a possible infection of the disease H1N1 (swine flu)."</p>
<p>Reynoso was widely quoted as saying in the media that he had told Penco he had the disease.</p>
<p>He later apologized for the incident, which was reported to have been accepted by Penco.</p>
<p>Guadalajara players complained that their opponents taunted them with remarks about swine flu during the game which ended 1-1.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu ' not a food safety issue'; Producers hurting, urge Albertans to put more pork on the menu to help out</b>
</div><div>Ben Gelinas   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal; with files from Trish Audette</div>
<div>740 words</div><div>5 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>

<p>Jurgen Preugschas wants consumers to eat an extra helping of pork until the H1N1 scare blows over.</p>
<p>"I appeal to Canadians and consumers around the world: eat an extra pork chop or an extra pork roast, one or two extra meals a week, and help us through so that we can continue to provide safe products to you in the years to come," said Preugschas, president of the Canadian Pork Council. "This is not a food safety issue. It is a human health issue."</p>
<p>China has banned the import of pork and live animals from Alberta. More than a dozen other countries from Azerbaijan to Thailand have imposed similar bans on North American pork and/or live pigs.</p>
<p>"We had hoped that our trading partners would base their decisions on science and not emotion," Gerald Hauer, Alberta's chief provincial veterinarian, said Monday.</p>
<p>But even buyers in countries that are still accepting Alberta pork are limiting or cancelling orders. "It's been a knee-jerk reaction," said Preugschas. "And it's costing our industry dearly."</p>
<p>Pork producers can't simply hold onto their animals until the industry rebounds, Preugschas said. Pigs must be sold before they get too big and lose their value. Preugschas sells about 250 hogs a week. Two of every three animals is exported, either live or as meat, so closing borders significantly limits business.</p>
<p>Preugschas said individual pigs are selling for $10 to $20 less than they were before news of the flu broke.</p>
<p>When a sick carpenter came into contact with the 2,200-pig herd on a central Alberta farm on April 14, the virus spread quickly from one animal to the next, since the animals are generally kept in large groups together in barns.</p>
<p>Canadian Food Inspection Agency tests have shown the virus found in the herd is similar to the one that has been moving among humans.</p>
<p>"A large number of the swine in the herd have been infected," agency veterinarian Jim Clark said. But the animals have fought the flu off on their own and are recovering, as is the carpenter.</p>
<p>The chances of a person contracting the virus from infected animals is remote. "When viruses adapt to a species, they (generally) lose the ability to infect the species they came from," Clark said. "There's no food safety issue with any animal infected."</p>
<p>Alberta's producers are already under strict guidelines to prevent the spread of disease among herds, said Herman Simons, chairman of Alberta Pork.</p>
<p>He urged Alberta producers to closely adhere to standard bio-security measures, including showering before and after interacting with pigs, keeping barns locked, and refraining from visiting one barn within 72 hours of visiting another. Additionally, Simons urged producers to keep people with flu-like symptoms away from their animals, and to contact a veterinarian promptly if animals cough, sneeze, refuse to eat and appear lethargic.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister George Groeneveld said Monday the discovery of swine flu in Alberta pigs shares no common ground with the province's 2003 outbreak of mad-cow disease.</p>
<p>"As far as the food safety issues, there's no comparison whatsoever," Groeneveld said. "We keep trying to get that message out there, that pork is safe to eat."</p>
<p>The province is taking solace in the fact that the United States and Japan -- Alberta's biggest pork trading partners -- haven't scaled back their imports.</p>
<p>"They have no intention of shutting that border," Groeneveld said of the Americans.</p>
<p>The long-term effects on the beef market following the 2003 BSE crisis should show Alberta how to handle threats to the pork industry, Edmonton-Riverview Liberal MLA Kevin Taft said.</p>
<p>"Alberta's vulnerable to international trade interference whether it's pork or beef or wheat or anything else, so we've got to continue to be aggressive, fighting for our markets," he said.</p>
<p>"I think the lesson we learned from BSE is these fights can be very expensive and very long and very damaging. I think we also really want to work to avoid a similar incident to BSE with the pork."</p>

<p>- The markets are in a rally mode so, hey, no more bad talk from the people in suits, OK?</p>
<p>- Let me get this straight: Mexico has a flu outbreak, so the school board cancels "once in a lifetime" trips to London and New York?</p>
<p>- School trips are being cancelled and the students and their families are out of pocket for the costs. Somebody at the school board is playing loose with other people's money.</p>
<p>- Now that pigs are catching the H1N1 flu, do we call it "People Flu"?</p>
<p>- I went crazy and cooked a beautiful pork roast Sunday with potatoes, gravy and vegetables -- and the world didn't come to an end. Maybe tomorrow.</p>
<p>- Support the pork industry? Most of us can't afford meat these days.</p>
<p>- Memo to Ron Liepert: Thanks for reassuring us the swine flu is no cause for alarm, but I'd feel more comfortable being assured of this by a medical expert as opposed to a politician who's an accomplished axe-grinder.</p>
<p>- This world is upside-down. We have to take a test to drive a car, but anybody can become the health minister.</p>
<p>- The Liberal MLA who made the "Scopes monkey" remark had the fortune of being let off the hook with minimal repercussions. Had that remark come from a Progressive Conservative member, the critics of the left would have swiftly condemned him or her as an intolerant redneck.</p>
<p>- A diet aid gets recalled because of "adverse side effects," yet tobacco products that kill people are still freely sold. Of course, the government gets revenue from tobacco sales.</p>
<p>- The province of Ontario has introduced legislation to prevent use of handheld cellphones while driving and to stop companies like <span class="companylink">Ticketmaster</span> from reselling tickets through affiliated sites at inflated prices. Yet our premier and his government refuse to consider doing the same.</p>
<p>- I'm still amazed the Stelmach government gave such little emphasis to axing health-care premiums, thereby reducing provincial revenues by $1 billion a year, only to later put Albertans through the wringer with proposals to reduce health-care costs by de-listing services.</p>
<p>- A desert in southern Alberta doesn't have to be hot to be a desert, it just has to be dry.</p>
<p>- It seems odd that Michael Ignatieff can blast the Tories for failing to unite Canadians.</p>
<p>It wasn't so many months ago the Liberals were trying to crawl in bed with the separatists.</p>
<p>- Stephen Harper doesn't want to follow the judge's ruling that Omar Kadhr be returned to Canada to be tried under Canadian law. Politicians may be elected and judges are not, but not even Harper is above the law.</p>
<p>- It always seems whenever a young person meets an untimely death due to violence related to drugs or the misuse of alcohol, the comments about the deceased include: "a great person," "a warm and caring individual," "thinking of going back to school," and "getting his life back on track."</p>
<p>- There are two seasons in Edmonton: Winter, when you have to keep your windows closed because it's cold outside; and summer, when you have to keep your windows closed because your neighbours play their music loud enough for all to hear.</p>
<p>- Ear-splitting motorcycles. Disabled mufflers. Juddering jake brakes. Thundering car stereos. Blasting boom boxes. Power mowers, weed-eaters and leaf blowers. Yet people want to shoot magpies because of the noise?</p>

</p>
<p>Re: "A little knowledge can be dangerous," by Caroline Foster-Boucher, Letters, May 3.</p>
<p>While I may share Caroline Foster-Boucher's discomfort at Ron Liepert serving as minister of health, I do not automatically discount his advice to Albertans in an effort to calm the anxiety over the Influenza A (H1N1) epidemic. Liepert is merely the messenger; his qualifications, or lack thereof, play no role in whether the advice is sound. He is simply echoing the advice of many qualified public health experts.</p>
<p>The school boards were premature to cancel field trips. No official government agency has issued advisories or bans for travel anywhere, except Mexico.</p>
<p>So far, the school boards have not been able to justify their bans with fact-based, empirical evidence that travel would pose a serious risk to the health of children.</p>
<p>Instead, Edmonton Public Schools says it consulted with various agencies and with two occupational health and safety nurses who have experience with pandemic planning. However, we do not know the details of the consultations, what specific advice (if any) was given, and the basis for that advice was. Why two occupational health and safety nurses would be given more authoritative weight than the advice of representatives of government agencies that have a duty to protect public health is baffling.</p>
<p>Foster-Boucher notes that infectious flu carriers can be asymptomatic for up to four days and says she would not want her child going into "crowded airports, and destinations that may well have far more cases of H1N1 than we are currently aware of." Presumably these destinations include all places where people congregate in crowds and where H1N1 can lurk in unsuspected carriers. Based on this, at the top of everyone's list should be Edmonton's schools, churches, shopping malls, theatres, restaurants, etc. Airports are no more or less risky than these places.</p>
<p>For that matter, neither are the destinations of the cancelled field trips -- such as London and Quebec -- any more risky than Edmonton is at the current time.</p>
<p>Edmonton's schools, churches, malls and airports are still open. Furthermore, there have been no official warnings telling us to avoid such places. We have simply been asked to remain vigilant and be alert to potential risk.</p>
<p>As to whether travel on airplanes increases risk, many readers might be surprised to learn that, according to studies that appeared after the SARS scare, airplanes are not the</p>
<p>giant flying petri dishes people fear them to be. The environmental control systems of airplanes, such as highly efficient HEPA filters, tend to restrict the spread of infectious agents and the perceived risk of getting an infection on an airplane is, in general, greater than the actual risk.</p>
<p>In fact, it might actually be a good risk mitigation strategy to put your child on a plane bound for Quebec or London or many of the other school field trip destinations that have a lower incidence of Influenza A H1N1 than Edmonton. The school boards should rescind their travel bans as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In 1976, president Gerald Ford announced a program to inoculate every man, woman and child in the U.S., based on evidence from</p>
<p>influenza experts who thought they saw trouble coming when a few severe cases of swine flu broke out among military recruits. One died and a few were said to be infected with the H1N1 influenza virus, which was responsible for the 1918 pandemic. Millions of doses of the vaccine were made and distributed within a few months.</p>
<p>But the pandemic never materialized and some critics say Americans were vaccinated for nothing. The vaccinations were halted after two months when 500 people who</p>
<p>received the shot developed a paralyzing nerve disease and more than 30 died. Washington paid out millions of dollars in damages to people who contracted the nerve disease or their families.</p>
<p>Policy-makers did not take a rational, evidence-based approach to guide the medical infrastructure responsible for informing politicians in 1976, and it appears this omission still prevails today.</p>

<p>Dr. Patrick Tang has been working 15- and 16-hour days for more than a week, ever since Mexico announced it had a swine flu outbreak on its hands.</p>
<p>Tang is a medical microbiologist working out of the provincial labs at the BC Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>The labs have seen an exponential surge in the number of samples being sent their way, as people with flu symptoms head to their doctors for testing.</p>
<p>Each day, between 200 and 300 flu samples have been arriving at the back delivery entrance of the labs on West 12th Avenue in Vancouver. That's between 10 and 20 times as many samples as the lab would normally handle.</p>
<p>Each sample has to go through several processes, with several highly trained scientists involved throughout.</p>
<p>"There are quite a few steps and it is quite complicated," Tang said Monday while standing in one of the building's many labs.</p>
<p>The samples arrive in sealed tubes and are first taken to a lab where the RNA -- or ribonucleic acid -- is extracted. The second test involves complicated genetic sequencing that determines what strain of the flu it is.</p>
<p>"In this lab, we're only dealing with the positive samples," Tang said. "We're sequencing the virus to see if it's the swine flu or a regular flu."</p>
<p>This part of the process takes about 12 hours, and the whole process can take up to 48 hours.</p>
<p>Of the 200 to 300 samples that enter the lab daily, Tang said about 10 per cent test positive for flu. So far though, only 39 have tested positive for the H1N1 swine flu virus.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ten new cases of swine flu in B.C., agency reports; Number brings total to 39, but none has been serious</b>
</div><div>Amy O'Brian and Pamela Fayerman   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>471 words</div><div>5 May 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The BC Centre for Disease Control reported 10 new cases of the H1N1 swine flu virus Monday, three in schoolchildren near Burns Lake.</p>
<p>There are now 39 confirmed cases of the virus in B.C., but none has been serious and everyone is either fully recovered or recovering.</p>
<p>"We haven't seen the kind of hospitalization or death rates that were witnessed in Mexico, to date," Dr. Danuta Skowronski, an epidemiologist with the BCCDC, said Monday.</p>
<p>And while public health officials continue to prepare for more cases, the sense of urgency has calmed since the early days of the outbreak.</p>
<p>At a media briefing Monday, Dr. Patricia Daly, chief medical health officer for Vancouver Coastal Health, said the H1N1 strain appears to be behaving the same as seasonal influenza, not as something far worse. Schools are seeing isolated cases, but she said shutting schools and local public facilities is not required.</p>
<p>Daly said much of the original information that came out of Mexico was incomplete, and many people were initially misdiagnosed with swine flu when they actually had other respiratory conditions. "As more test results come in and more epidemiologists look at the number from Mexico, the feeling now is that while there would have been deaths, these would be at rates that we see with a regular seasonal influenza," Daly said.</p>
<p>Each year in Canada, between 4,000 and 7,000 people die from the flu, Skowronski said.</p>
<p>She is encouraged by how the virus has behaved in B.C., but said there are still many unknowns about swine flu. "We're still learning something new each day about the virus," she said. "And I expect, unfortunately, that there will be hospitalizations and deaths as this continues to unfold."</p>
<p>Decker Lake elementary school near Burns Lake will be closed until further notice after three of its students were diagnosed over the weekend with the H1N1 virus. The school closed early Friday on the advice of public health officials, after 17 per cent of the school population called in sick, many with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Parents of children attending Strathcona elementary school in Vancouver complained to The Vancouver Sun that a student they thought had the H1N1 flu was returning to school even though the student might still be infectious.</p>
<p>But a school board spokesman said the student is not a confirmed H1N1 case, stayed home for several days, and has a right to return to school.</p>

<p>Yes, the hype and coverage bordering on hysteria might prove to be out of proportion to the threat posed by the H1N1 virus, but if all the coverage gets even one extra person actually to cover his mouth when coughing or sneezing or to wash his hands, then I say bring on the hype!</p>
<p>There are many virulent illnesses out there that we encounter every day (C-difficile anyone?) and increasing personal hygiene vigilance will benefit us all.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mother's Day wishes; Other than breakfast in bed, she really only wants some love and happiness. But you can still say those things with a gift!</b>
</div><div>EVA FRIEDE   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>744 words</div><div>5 May 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>D1 / BREAK</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>What do mothers want for Mother's Day? "Nothing," my mother responded when asked. That may not be strictly true, for my mother and for many others.</p>
<p>But what they really want may not be what you think.</p>
<p>"Peace of mind,'' responded Shelley Rozenwald, president of Murale, the new cosmetics emporium chain, and the mother of a 21-year-old son and 16-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>What peace means to Rozenwald is the age-old Jewish "naches" - the health and happiness of her children.</p>
<p>"As I get older that's what I want for them,'' she said. "That is really the true meaning of motherhood.''</p>
<p>In town from Toronto for the Canadian Fragrance Awards, Montreal-born Rozenwald joked that if all daughters, sons and husbands heeded her advice it would kill the fragrance and beauty industries.</p>
<p>Rozenwald was one of a number of moms polled on what they really want next Sunday. Keep in mind, most of these women work in the beauty industry and tend to have access to all the beauty products and perfume they can use.</p>
<p>India Hicks, the former British model with royal lineage (Prince Charles is a second cousin, Lord Mountbatten was her grandfather), is an author, television host and the creator of Island Living scents for Crabtree and Evelyn. She is also the mother of four, a 15-month-old girl and three boys, the eldest of whom is 12.</p>
<p>Based in the Bahamas, she travels constantly to promote her line; last week she was in Montreal, where her new Island Living Scent received an award for a private label launch.</p>
<p>"I can't tell you what I want. I can tell you what I don't want: swine flu,'' said Hicks, who said she will be on "about 26 different planes between now and Mother's Day." The last thing she wants is to pass an illness on to her children. Aside from that, rose and violet chocolate creams would be nice.</p>
<p>Said Dali Sanschagrin, who has just written a book offering unbiased advice on beauty products (See page D3): "A house in Tunisia by the sea."</p>
<p>On a more practical note, she wished for no fighting with her 6-year-old son. "He's my best friend. When we fight, I can't believe it."</p>
<p>Virginie Vincens, public relations director for Chanel in Canada, and the mother of a girl, 5, and boy, 8, was brief and to the point: "Time with them,'' she said.</p>
<p>Marie-José Desmarais, publisher of LouLou magazine, loves cards from her two boys, 9 and 16, especially the crafty hand-made efforts from the younger boy. "I cherish them,'' she said, adding she doesn't care about gifts. "I'm totally against the buying of things. It has to be meaningful."</p>
<p>What she really loves is tradition. "I would be very sad if I didn't get the breakfast in bed,'' Desmarais said.</p>
<p>Does it have to be something superficial? asked Roberta Granshaw, a mother of two boys, 16</p>
<p>and 13, who works in marketing at Coty. "I want family peace,'' she said. "When I was younger, it would have been a weekend at the spa."</p>
<p>A day at the spa with the works - pampering, massage, manicure, pedicure - would be lovely, said Mickey Tortorelli, the mother of three girls, 12, 16 and 19, who runs JAV Group in Toronto, which provides training for beauty advisers. And a nice family dinner to end the day.</p>
<p>The wish for peace, love and a little pampering notwithstanding, most of us feel the need to say it with a gift. On these pages, there are some ideas to give and to get for mom or for yourself. Certain items - cellulite cream and tummy tuckers - are perhaps sensitive to give (especially if you're the dad); others like jewellery or the classic Hermès scarf are always a treat. Mainly it's about treating mom, and treating yourself, too.</p>
<p>As for my mother, eventually she allowed that she could use a small vacuum cleaner. She called back a few minutes later. "A blazer that fits.'' That's a tall - make that petite - order: She's between sizes and hard to fit. But that's another story.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Obama's first 100 days showed government is back in vogue</b>
</div><div>David Zussman   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>941 words</div><div>5 May 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>The United States is a great sporting nation and as a result, Americans like keeping score and handicapping most public events. The performance of their presidents is no exception and, since the early days of the Roosevelt presidency, the media have marked the first 100 days by providing a report card based on their performance.</p>
<p>It is generally acknowledged that no other U.S. president has arrived in office with higher expectations than Barack Obama, and more difficult problems. It is, therefore, not surprising that he has been subjected to a steeper learning curve than his predecessors.</p>
<p>By the time Obama was sworn in on Jan. 20, the U.S. financial system was in freefall, the credit markets were becoming unglued, house prices were tumbling, and a half-dozen foreign hotspots required presidential attention. It is difficult to imagine how it could have been more challenging.</p>
<p>Since the 100-day mark is an artificial marker, the White House staff was reluctant to join in on the rating game but their efforts proved futile. Once they realized that it was going to be impossible to blunt the media's interest in rating the administration's performance, some senior staff tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to lower the public's expectations regarding Obama's early accomplishments by assigning themselves a B-plus. And finally, the White House embraced the 100-day anniversary, with the president appearing at last week's 100-day town hall celebration in St. Louis.</p>
<p>At this point, given all of the challenges and difficulties encountered by Obama, he remains a very popular political leader. In fact, according to the Pew Foundation, his personal popularity is higher than the ratings for his individual programs.</p>
<p>However, there is a very wide gap in the perceptions of Democrats and Republicans, suggesting that he might be one of the most polarizing presidents when compared with his predecessors. This may foreshadow future political tensions in the United States.</p>
<p>While not popular with Republicans, Obama appears to have precipitated a dramatic shift in attitude in favour of a greater role for government in the United States and may be giving a new name to the notion of activism.</p>
<p>Most observers attribute the positive rankings to Obama's personal style. He offers calm leadership that is heavily dependent on teamwork.</p>
<p>It is generally acknowledged that his eclectic team of advisers has two characteristics. First, they represent a wide range of ideological beliefs that appears to have broad appeal, and they seek a consensus among key decision makers before they act. In addition, he prefers to signal his intentions and his overall policy direction, but is reluctant to dictate how the policy will be implemented. At this point, he is perfectly willing to allow Congress to sort out how his policies will be implemented.</p>
<p>Ironically, some observers have noted that his approach to governing is the one used by Ronald Reagan more than a generation ago. Former Clinton labour secretary, Robert Reich, may have captured best Obama's "cool" approach to governing when he described the president as being "the serene center of the cyclone -- exuding calm when most Americans are petrified."</p>
<p>While management style is obviously an important factor, America has also changed its attitudes since George W. Bush was first elected in 2000. The American population is aging and appears more predisposed to accept an increased role for government. Given the obvious failure of the Bush administration to buffer Americans from the impact of unfettered markets, it is not surprising that Obama has been very effective in changing the conversation with Americans and bringing in a new paradigm about governing that includes a broader role for government.</p>
<p>The swine flu epidemic that is sweeping across the world is a good example of how events can upset the best plans of newly elected governments.</p>
<p>The American political system replaces its senior managers after each change of administration but this time it has been severely handicapped during this crisis period. More significant, the epidemic has also exposed the weaknesses of the American transition process that requires it to replace the top 7,000 public servants.</p>
<p>The complex vetting procedures in addition to the generally cumbersome appointment process has created a backlog of appointments that is undermining the government's ability to respond to its various challenges. For example, at this point, the Obama administration has still to fill around 15 senior executive health jobs, with a similar number of vacancies at the Treasury department.</p>
<p>One observer noted that "we're setting up a system where the only people who qualify to work in government are the ones who never actually left government." Trapped between retaining the former Bush-appointed administrators or following a lengthy search process to find suitable replacements, the government is leaderless in too many key departments.</p>
<p>While the first 100 days are not a very good predictor of what is to come, it is clear that the public is currently content with President Obama's performance. He has introduced a new vocabulary and style to governing and he evidently understands Prof. Drew Westen's observation that citizens want to hear values-based and emotionally compelling narratives from their political leaders. As in Canada, Americans want to be reassured that their leadership can feel their pain and is working in their interests.</p>

<p>When I saw the World Health Organization's web link to handwashing in the paper the other day, I was intrigued. The WHO had come up with a nine-step handwashing process to prevent the spread of swine flu or the R2-D2 virus, whatever they're calling it now. I decided to check it out.</p>
<p>So I went online and learned I've been washing my hands wrong my entire life. I took a look at my poor old paddys and never felt so shabby.</p>
<p>Nine steps seemed a little elaborate to me, and so did the 40-60 seconds WHO expects me to spend cleansing the mitts every single time. I'm not scrubbing up before performing heart surgery, right?</p>
<p>It struck me that WHO is an outfit with too much time on its hands, spotless though those hands may be. But I was determined to change my grubby ways. I downloaded the WHO guide and went to work.</p>
<p>I turned the faucet on OK but after that it all went down the drain, you could say. I got flummoxed when Step 4 said "Right palm over left hand with interlace fingers and vice-versa." That segued into "Backs of fingers to opposing palms with fingers interlocked ... rotational rubbing of left thumb clasped in right palm and vice-versa."</p>
<p>We Wards are not very strong in the head at the best of times, but this was too much. I wasn't sure if I was throwing gang signs or conjuring a magic trick. I stood there kneading my hands unctuously like a villain in a Dickens novel.</p>
<p>The WHO steps were illustrated, some with arrows. Whenever I see diagrams with arrows I think of John Madden, the NFL blatherer who retired recently. It made me wonder how Madden might comment on the WHO guide.</p>
<p>Peter Pointer is one of the biggest fingers on the field and when those big ol' guys collide with the Pinkys -- Doink! I mean, Boom! That's just the way it is, especially when it's so soapy out there. Man, I wish it would snow!</p>
<p>After I gave up on the nine-step process, I started thinking about what a WHO directive/guide to Chewing Gum and Walking Simultaneously might be like.</p>
<p>Step 1. Affix safety goggles, then sit comfortably at table or desk in well-lighted space. Wear loose-fitting clothing. With hands encased in work gloves, unwrap chewing gum. If foil, dispose of wrapper in bio-hazards container.</p>
<p>Step 2. Open oral cavity or "mouth," then place gum between lower premolars (bicuspids) and the canines. Masticate moodily, eight beats to the bar. Do not blow bubbles, or engage in any other diversionary tactic.</p>
<p>Step 3. Check to be sure safety boots are properly secured, then rise from table or desk, taking care not to spill milk.</p>
<p>Step 4. Move the left pedal extremity or "foot" forward in graceful gliding motion. Then move right foot in a similar manner. Place tray in the upright and locked position. Breathe normally.</p>
<p>Step 5. Do not attempt "put your left foot in/ take your left foot out" manoeuvre as in popular dance "The Hokey Pokey," once a staple at wedding receptions.</p>
<p>Step 6. Resume chewing in stately manner, like cow gazing at freight train. Once the seatbelt sign has been turned off, you may walk around the cabin chewing vigourously if desired.</p>
<p>Step 7. Warning: Do not swallow gum. It will stay in body forever, no matter what Wrigley's says.</p>
<p>Step 8. Your chewing gum may lose its flavour on bedpost overnight. This is normal.</p>
<p>Step 9. Next, do-si-do your partner and swing 'em off their feet. With a hey-nonny-nonny, if possible.</p>
<p>Step 10. Should the air pressure drop as you are perambulating, an oxygen mask will fall from the compartment above you. Place the mask over your nose and mouth, pulling the straps on either side to tighten the mask against your face. Take care not to get gum stuck in straps.</p>
<p>Step 11. As you hasten forward, do not "crack" gum. No less an authority than Bazooka Joe has stated that this is annoying to innocent passersby who may glare. Cracking gum brings the majority of law-abiding gum-chewers into disrepute.</p>
<p>Step 12. When all feeling is gone from jaws, prepare to dispose of gum. Halt, then stand stationary. Cease chewing. Bend forward and allow gum to drop from mouth into cupped palm. Place gum into United Nations-approved receptacle, now available in sporty U Thant model.</p>
<p>Step 13. Begin washing hands again, stopping only for prayer.</p>

<p>Ben Bernanke was in the right spot at the right time. Before becoming chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, Bernanke was an economics scholar whose area of expertise just happened to be the Great Depression.</p>
<p>No economist in the world knew more than Bernanke about that terrible event, and specifically about how the banks and financial institutions dealt with it at the time. Bernanke came to believe that one of the causes of the Depression was that banks were reluctant to lend when times got bad.</p>
<p>When Bernanke succeeded Alan Greenspan to become America's top money man, no one could have predicted that his intense knowledge and study of the Depression -- and the role that banking played --would be so vital. But it has. As banks began failing, bad debts stopped being paid and the global stock markets cratered, Bernanke emerged on the scene having spent a lifetime preparing for what to do.</p>
<p>We have seen dark days since late 2008. The North American auto industry teetered on the edge. Americans walked away from their homes, some even living in tent cities in California. Confidence, a vital part of the huge consumer economy, flagged.</p>
<p>While the rest of us fretted, Bernanke dropped interest rates to historic lows, attempted to make credit easier for businesses and consumers, and used monetary tools at his disposal to move the economy forward. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has gone a long way to support a number of financial institutions and intervene in the sagging auto industry.</p>
<p>The good news is that all these measures appear to be working. The recession continues, but Bernanke and others at the Federal Reserve believe the worst is over. Bernanke and the Fed are not alone in this view. World stock markets have been rising on the same belief, though it would be more reassuring if they did so on greater volume.</p>
<p>Bernanke has learned that you don't change a winning game. The Fed will maintain interest rates near zero and will continue to buy up $1.7-trillion U.S. worth of Treasury bills and mortgage bonds to further stimulate the economy. The Fed says consumer spending has levelled (with car purchases providing most of the 2.2-per-cent annual increase) while financial conditions have improved.</p>
<p>"The economy has continued to contract, though the pace of contraction appears to be somewhat slower," the Fed said the other day. All this is occurring before government stimulus can reach the economy, which, when it does, will provide a further boost.</p>
<p>Still, for the person on the street, there will be more uncertain days ahead. Don't expect unemployment to rapidly decrease. Even if consumer demand comes back, companies will be able to ramp up production without necessarily hiring people. As well, residential and commercial construction is still decreasing in the U.S.</p>
<p>Yet there are unmistakable signs of strength. Stock markets have remained stable in the face of the H1N1 flu threat. And in Canada, the long-term outlook for our commodities is bullish.</p>
<p>The recession is not over, but it's entirely possible that we have turned the corner.</p>

<p>Re: When death stalked Ottawa, May 3.</p>
<p>The Citizen's retrospective on how the City of Ottawa responded to the 1918 Spanish Influenza pandemic provided useful parallels with measures being implemented in 2009. One caution to the public in 1918 was to refrain from spitting so as to curb the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>With the return of fine weather this spring and coinciding with the arrival of H1N1 (human swine flu), public health authorities might want to take a stroll down Rideau Street. There they could take the measure of the current propensity to expectorate.</p>
<p>The newly returned swarms of Ottawa's street people between the Bay store entrance and George Street make it difficult to run for the bus. This broken field running is rendered more challenging by having to dodge the spit projectiles which seem to punctuate each communal toke.</p>
<p>The erstwhile bus plaza outside the Department of National Defence HQ on the Mackenzie King Bridge, now more intimate due to the installation of blast barriers, earns a close second in the smoking and spitting league.</p>
<p>It's time for the city to assess this particular disease vector and enforce whatever bylaws might apply.</p>

<p>Swine flu could strike with a "vengeance" in the coming months, the director general of the World Health Organization said Monday.</p>
<p>Dr. Margaret Chan said a second wave of the virus would be the "biggest of all outbreaks the world has faced in the 21st century," puncturing optimism that the spread may have been contained.</p>
<p>She also indicated that the body is likely to raise its flu alert level to the top of its six-point scale, meaning that the virus has spread between different regions and a pandemic is under way.</p>
<p>Last week the agency raised its alert level to five, which indicated that a pandemic was "imminent."</p>
<p>"Level six does not mean in any way that we are facing the end of the world. It is important to make this clear because when we announce level six it will cause an unnecessary panic," Chan said.</p>
<p>But "flu viruses are very unpredictable, very deceptive. We should not be overconfident. The situation is evolving and the virus is changing," she added.</p>
<p>She said the end of the flu season in the northern hemisphere meant that, while any initial outbreak could be mild, a second wave may be far worse.</p>
<p>That would reflect a pattern seen with the 1918 flu pandemic that killed as many as 50 million people worldwide.</p>

<p>With new cases of swine flu emerging each day, Canadian businesses should begin preparations for safety and operational contingency plans in case the virus is upgraded to a full-scale pandemic, says the Canadian Centre for Emergency Preparedness.</p>
<p>The non-profit organization estimates that only 40 to 50 per cent of Canadian companies, large and small, have a formal pandemic plan in place, with the majority of those being large corporations.</p>
<p>"Regulated industries, like financial institutions, are the ones that are better prepared because they have to prove that they are ready," said Ralph Dunham, the group's managing director for business continuity. "It's the ones that are struggling, entrepreneurs, smaller enterprises, that aren't as prepared. This is one of those things that never got to the top of their list of things to do."</p>
<p>Dunham said emergency preparedness plans are needed to deal with medical crises, natural disasters and unplanned interruptions.</p>
<p>Businesses need to establish clear response plans and establish a formal decision-making process to execute the plans.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization alert level now stands at five on a scale of six, with six being considered a full-scale pandemic. Most companies are not planning on closing their doors if the level is raised.</p>
<p>At telecommunications giant Telus, company brass believe they are ready should the H1N1 virus situation get any worse. In fact, according to the company's vice-president of risk management, Telus has been ready for an outbreak for years.</p>
<p>"We've had a very detailed business continuity plan in place for a number of years, including what we call the Telus health emergency plan, which we had in place prior to the outbreak of SARS in 2003," said Kasey Reese.</p>
<p>Reese said the company also learned "from our experience with SARS, which we incorporated back into our health emergency plan."</p>
<p>At the Vancouver Public Library, spokeswoman Jean Kavanagh said some of the 900 staff have expressed concern over the last week about how they can protect themselves, but in the meantime not much has changed in their operations.</p>
<p>"I haven't heard of anything dramatic happening. We're waiting for the lead from the health authority and will respond when we get that information," she said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Ceridian Canada</span>, a payroll, human resources and employee assistance program company, said they're preparing for this outbreak by equipping their 1,400 staff nationwide with good information.</p>
<p>"If people get a sense of what they can do to protect themselves and their families, it will alleviate anxiety and fear," said spokeswoman Ingrid Taylor at the company's Markham, Ont., headquarters.</p>

<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>

</p>
<p>Manure from cattle and pigs far outweighs human sewage as the source of E. coli pollution in Lake Huron, says a new Canadian study that helps show why the bacteria pollution problem is growing.</p>
<p>After years of arguments over where the disease-carrying bacteria come from -- humans, livestock or wildlife -- DNA "fingerprinting" says human sewage is only a tiny fraction of the problem.</p>
<p>In samples from Lake Huron and the creeks and rivers feeding it, cattle and pig manure accounted for 59 to 62 per cent of the E. coli.</p>
<p>Human sewage contributed just one to three per cent. The rest came from wildlife, from bacteria that have adapted to living in the water, or from sources that couldn't be identified.</p>
<p>The study of near-shore lake water between the towns of Goderich and Kincardine has wider implications across Ontario and Quebec, and comes just as the hog industry is already shaken by the swine flu scare.</p>
<p>As far back as 2001, Canada's former environment commissioner warned that manure pollution in all the lower Great Lakes -- Ontario, Erie and Huron -- is getting worse and current farming practices "cannot be sustained."</p>
<p>All three lakes have beaches frequently posted as unsafe for swimming.</p>
<p>But farmers, cities and towns with sewage systems, and owners of lakeside property have all blamed each other.</p>
<p>The new study from scientists at the University of Guelph and Ontario's Environment Ministry looks at the DNA of E. coli, which adapts its genetic material depending on what animal it lives in.</p>
<p>"Our results demonstrated that the dominant source of E. coli pollution of the lake was agriculture, followed by environmentally adapted E. coli strains, wildlife, and then humans," the study says. ("Environmentally adapted" strains are E. coli that have mutated to live in the water, not in the intestines of animals.)</p>
<p>"A similar ratio of contributing sources was observed in all samples collected from various locations ... in both 2005 and 2006," it says.</p>
<p>And since creeks feeding into the lake had the same bacterial mix as the lake itself, they conclude that these small tributaries are the main source of the lake pollution.</p>
<p>Pig farming has boomed in southern Ontario since 2000, as "intensive livestock operations" pack 5,000 or more pigs in a single barn. The excrement is mixed with water and stored in giant vats until a tanker truck can spray it on fields, often twice a year.</p>
<p>"To me it can't be dismissed simply as runoff to the lake that's a problem for swimmers," said Valerie M'Garry, a land use lawyer in the London area who has opposed industrial-scale hog farms.</p>
<p>"A little south of there (the study area), there's the intake for the city of London, the city of Sarnia, then Wallaceburg, and you can trace it around to intakes in Lake Erie." The more pollution the water has, the harder and more expensive it is to treat drinking water, she said.</p>
<p>She wasn't surprised that livestock was the source of the bacteria: "I always assumed it was."</p>
<p>Cattle were identified as the source of the E. coli that killed six and sickened 2,000 in Walkerton in 2000.</p>
<p>In 2003, federal scientists estimated that the manure from Ontario and Quebec farms is equivalent to untreated sewage from 100 million people.</p>
<p>Manure doesn't affect all areas equally: Federal studies show the primary sources of E. coli at Toronto and Hamilton beaches are gulls and geese in the shallowest water, and municipal waste water in the deeper water.</p>
<p>The study is printed in the March issue of the Canadian Journal of Microbiology, published by the National Research Council.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Edmonton girl first severe flu victim; China isolates Quebec students as a precaution</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey And Megan O'Toole   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service and National Post</div>
<div>692 words</div><div>5 May 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>All But Toronto</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>An Edmonton girl was hospitalized with Canada's first severe case of human swine influenza yesterday, just as a group of 22 students from the University of Montreal were placed under quarantine after arriving for study in China.</p>
<p>The girl, who was in the hospital's intensive care unit, had no known connection to Mexico, and officials are bracing for more such cases as "community-based spread" picks up, according to chief public health officer David Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>"This case underscores a couple of things about influenza," he said. "It has few boundaries. It doesn't respect borders. It often doesn't respect age. Nature is very unpredictable, as is the influenza virus."</p>
<p>All previous cases of the H1N1 flu virus in Canada have been mild, and patients have recovered fully. More than three dozen new cases were reported countrywide yesterday, spanning British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island -- bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Canada to 140.</p>
<p>Globally, the number of cases has surpassed 1,000 among 21 countries, including 26 fatalities, according to the World Health Organization, which was one step away from deeming the outbreak a pandemic.</p>
<p>While "disconcerting," the Edmonton girl's case is not surprising and will not change the official response to the flu, Dr. Butler-Jones said, noting more cases with varying levels of severity will certainly be uncovered as H1N1 follows the pattern of normal, seasonal influenza. "Even with regular seasonal flu we see people get very ill," he said.</p>
<p>"We on occasion also see young, otherwise healthy people get very ill, or die. It is a very, very serious disease."</p>
<p>The girl from Edmonton, whose identity was being withheld by the province, was in stable condition and "doing well under care," according to Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, health authorities stopped 22 Montreal students upon their arrival at Changchun airport in China's Jilin province on Sunday. None of the students nor their teacher, who were in the country to study Mandarin, showed signs of the H1N1 flu, but all have been placed under quarantine in northern China for seven days as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Canadian consular officers were in contact with the students "to ensure they are well cared for," adding officials were planning to meet with the students today.</p>
<p>"Consular officials have already spoken with members of the group by phone and they report they are being well treated," Ms. Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>Human swine influenza appears to have a longer-than-normal incubation period and can lead to pneumonia and death even in young, healthy people, WHO officials said. But experts still could not say how often the virus causes a severe form of the illness.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mexico said it was winning the battle against the virus and businesses were reopening after a partial five-day shutdown.</p>
<p>Twenty countries worldwide have banned imports of pork in response to the discovery of the virus in a herd of about 220 pigs on a central Alberta hog farm.</p>
<p>Federal officials believe the pigs contracted the virus from a Canadian worker who returned from Mexico in mid-April and developed flu symptoms shortly afterward. Such a transmission would mark the first known case of a human transferring the strain to an animal. All of the pigs on the farm have been quarantined.</p>
<p>Canada threatened to take China to the World Trade Organization unless Beijing backed down from its ban on imports of pigs and pork from Alberta.</p>
<p>While the new H1N1 virus is not food-borne, fears it may spread through animal products have prompted restrictions on live pigs, pork, cattle, poultry, livestock, feed and animal semen from countries with infections.</p>
<p>The three countries most affected by the pork bans thus far include Mexico, the United States and Canada -- all among the world's top pork exporters in a global trade worth about $26-billion annually.</p>

</p>
<p>The recession and swine flu outbreak have cut into travel demand, prompting <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines</span> Ltd.to scale back its forecast this year for growth in seat capacity.</p>
<p>The Calgary-based carrier said Tuesday that it expects its capacity will climb 3 per cent in 2009, down from its previous forecast of 5 per cent.</p>
<p>WestJet and its vacations division cancelled service to Mexico on Monday, part of an array of airlines and tour operators to suspend such flights after the H1N1 influenza virus scared away many consumers from making Mexican bookings. WestJet flights to and from Mexico are slated to resume June 20.</p>
<p>WestJet chief executive officer Sean Durfy said during a conference call that the carrier's domestic and transborder schedule into the United States won't escape the recession unscathed as he eliminates some red-eye routes and trims various non-peak flights.</p>
<p>But he emphasized that the airline intends to expand later this year, when it will add seven more planes to its fleet of 79 aircraft.</p>
<p>He made the comments after WestJet announced a 29-per-cent drop in second-quarter profit to $37.4-million. Per-share profit slipped to 29 cents from 40 cents, while revenue dipped 3.3 per cent to $579-million</p>
<p>The per-share profit beat analysts' expectations, spurring a rally in WestJet shares on Tuesday.</p>
<p>WestJet's load factor, or the proportion of seats filled by paying customers, sagged to 81.2 per cent last month, compared with 82.5 per cent in April, 2008.</p>
<p>The carrier's first-quarter seat capacity rose 7.2 per cent to 1.47 billion available seat miles while traffic increased 5.5 per cent to 1.19 billion revenue passenger miles.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Launching of centre for deadly organisms proves to be timely</b>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>At yesterday's launch of a centre for potentially dangerous organisms called zoonoses that jump to human from other animals, the current H1N1 flu outbreak was top of mind among speakers and scores of guests.</p>
<p>"You'd probably have to be living in a cave on the moon not to hear about this," Centre for Public Health and Zoonoses director Dr. Jan Sargeant said.</p>
<p>Sargeant said the outbreak, first noted in Mexico and the U.S. but spreading globally, has raised a lot of questions among the public. They range from the nature of the illness to who's at risk, to what degree and whether there should be travel restrictions and the closing of schools and businesses when cases are discovered, and how big a threat people are facing.</p>
<p>In recent days, some people have even questioned whether it was safe to eat pork, she added. "Public health problems are by their nature very complex," Sargeant told an audience at the university's Ontario Veterinary College learning centre.</p>
<p>With no single organization able to provide a comprehensive overview of risks from zoonoses, Sargeant said the best approach is the growing collaboration between her centre and other health organizations in the field, including the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.</p>
<p>"I hope the future is achieving this."</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu directly impacted yesterday's official launch of the centre as several keynote speakers were called away to deal with a growing crisis that has to date made 140 Canadians, including 31 Ontarians, sick.</p>
<p>Missing speakers included Canadian Food Inspection Agency executive vice-president Dr. Brian Evans, Public Health Agency of Canada infectious diseases director general Dr. Mark Raizenne, Ontario chief veterinary officer Dr. Deb Stark and Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion chief executive Dr. Vivek Goel.</p>
<p>Public safety is a key concern in the years ahead for the new centre, university research vice-president Kevin Hall said.</p>
<p>"It is a very high priority for us," he said, adding the centre's mandate to prevent or mitigate emerging diseases draws on scientific expertise from across campus. With 50 scientists and 75 students working out of McNabb House on campus, the centre focuses on food, water and environmental health research, and offer insight into public health policy. Though operating little more than a year to date, it's contributed to an understanding of pet, sports, agricultural and wildlife animal zoonoses, as well as resistance to antibiotics that fight these sometimes deadly organisms.</p>
<p>Veterinary college dean Dr. Elizabeth Stone called the centre a good fit for the local campus, which has carried out public health research for many decades. It dates back to research the better part of a century ago on bacteria in milk.</p>
<p>"In the last couple weeks, we've been thinking of the bad effects," she said of the flu outbreak, adding that's only one aspect. Animals benefit people greatly, she said, citing therapeutic horse riding, seeing-eye dogs and the love of companion pets as examples.</p>
<p>In the future, the centre will research other ways animals contribute to better health among people.</p>

</p>
<p>MEXICO</p>
<p>ground zero in the global flu outbreak -- is all but sounding the all-clear. Experts say pork is safe to eat, but Alberta pigs have some turning up their noses. And perfectly healthy Canadians are among a group of tourists under quarantine in China.</p>
<p>The truth, it seems, has become a casualty of the world's war against the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Contradictions were rampant on the outbreak front yesterday, particularly in Canada, where a sharp jump in the national caseload to 140 -- including a "severe'' case involving a young Alberta girl in an Edmonton hospital -- left Mexico's optimism seeming misplaced.</p>
<p>"This case underscores a couple of things about influenza: it has few boundaries, it doesn't respect borders, (and) it often doesn't respect age,'' said a stern-faced David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"It is a very, very serious disease that takes its toll on people, young and old, so we need to stay vigilant.''</p>
<p>Officials in Mexico, where the outbreak alert level was lowered yesterday to orange from red, seemed to feel differently. In Mexico City, restaurants, amusement parks and museums were poised to reopen later this week after several days in self-imposed exile.</p>
<p>"Mexico is trying to return to normalcy as soon as possible,'' a defiant President Felipe Calderon said in an interview that aired Sunday. "We are going to win this battle.''</p>
<p>A world away, an excess of vigilance was on full display in China, where two developments -- a ban on Alberta-bred pork after some pigs tested positive for the virus and the quarantine of several Canadian tourists who did not -- struck some as irrational and unjustified.</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs spokesperson Alain Cacchione said Canadians were among those at the Metro Park Hotel in the Wanchai district of Hong Kong who were placed under "preventive medical surveillance'' on the weekend after a guest tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Some 29 students from the Universite de Montreal, all but six of them Canadian, were meanwhile in preventive quarantine in a hotel in the city of Changchun in northern China after arriving there from Montreal, officials said.</p>
<p>"I think the quarantine was in the cards regardless of what symptoms they had,'' said David Ownby, director of the university's East Asian studies program, who characterized the situation as little more than wrong place, wrong time.</p>
<p>"They had no symptoms whatsoever.''</p>
<p>In Ottawa, Liberal foreign affairs critic Bob Rae grilled the government about China's decision to quarantine Canadian citizens.</p>
<p>"It would seem that there has been no justification, no public health reason on the part of the Chinese government,'' Rae said during Question Period.</p>
<p>Officials in the Canadian consulate in China were asked to ensure those in quarantine there are being treated well, Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said.</p>
<p>Mexico, too, was angry -- not only for the quarantining of its citizens, but also for what it described as the singling out of Mexican nationals and for the arbitrary banning of flights from Mexico by Argentina, Peru and Cuba.</p>
<p>"I think it's unfair that because we have been honest and transparent with the world, some countries and places are taking repressive and discriminatory measures because of ignorance and disinformation,'' Calderon said.</p>
<p>For Alberta's hog producers, the Chinese ban on pork was more a slap in the face than a blow to the gut. The big fear, they said, was of the United States, already in "Buy American'' mode thanks to the ongoing economic crisis, closing its doors.</p>
<p>''That's the one (domino) we don't want to fall,'' said Florian Possberg of Canada Pork International, an organization charged with keeping markets open for Canadian products.</p>
<p>"The fact the U.S. has maintained our trading relationship has been very helpful for us.''</p>
<p>Canada sends six million hogs to the U.S. -- its only market for live pork product -- each year, Possberg said. In 2008, total Canadian pork exports were valued at $2.7 billion, including nearly $527 million worth of Canadian live swine exports.</p>
<p>China and at least eight other countries on four continents banned Alberta pork after reports surfaced this weekend that 220 hogs had been quarantined after being passed the H1N1 virus earlier this month from a worker who had been in Mexico.</p>
<p>The ban on Canadian pork is far from the only display of outbreak-induced irrationality. In Egypt, a predominantly Muslim country where pigs are raised and pork consumed solely by the country's Christian minority, every one of the animals has been ordered killed.</p>
<p>"China is operating outside of sound science,'' federal Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said yesterday during Question Period.</p>
<p>"We're looking for clarification as to why they've gone as far as they have.''</p>
<p>International Trade Minister Stockwell Day denounced the ban as "disappointing and unwarranted,'' and said Canadian officials are making the rounds to make sure those countries that have banned pork imports are aware of the facts.</p>
<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has said the United States has no plans to alter its trade policies regarding Canadian pork.</p>
<p>The outbreak has cost the pork industry in the U.S. an estimated $3 US million a day, said Dave Warner of the Washington-based National Pork Producers Council.</p>
<p>"They're trying to protect their domestic markets, but they know that the viruses are not food-borne, they're respiratory, so they know this is a bogus issue,'' Warner said of the trade bans.</p>
<p>"We will ask that the border be allowed to be kept open for pig movements. We're satisfied that the virus in that one herd was contained.''</p>
<p>Reports yesterday that the World Health Organization was poised to move its six-tiered alert level to Phase 6 -- that of a full-blown pandemic -- proved premature.</p>

</p>
<p>I must admit that the current fears over H1N1 flu have me a bit baffled.</p>
<p>We have turned away from the term "epidemic" (a disease "among the people") to the new catchword, "pandemic," (a disease of "all the people," affecting an entire country or the entire world.) But isn't this word used a bit too freely?</p>
<p>There have, as of Monday, been 937 confirmed cases of this flu in people worldwide. Newspapers and other media talk about it as if it is on the doorstep waiting to pounce, and I suppose it could be. But those are 937 people out of more than six billion. Is this reason for the panic that has settled in?</p>
<p>What about the fact that 30,000 people die every day from hunger? That's more than 30 deaths every day for each person who has become sick with this flu -- and no one has died yet in Canada.</p>
<p>If we harnessed the world's concern for protection from a virus that has affected so few and turned it into concern about hunger and poverty in the world, what a difference that would make.</p>

And we can even see why he'd emit ominous rumblings about toppling the minority Conservative government unless it improves employment insurance benefits.</p>
<p>The current system, with arcane qualification rules that vary from region to region, unfairly excludes thousands of Canadians who have paid into the program but can take nothing back in return. If there's any time unemployed workers need help, it's now, when their ranks have swollen in a frightening recession. To Ignatieff's credit, he's pushing the right policy at the right moment.</p>
<p>Beyond this, flexing some recently acquired political muscle is sound public relations. As a new leader, unencumbered by a substantial record in office, Ignatieff can for some time bask in the warmth of a public opinion honeymoon. Recent polls have placed the Liberals in first place. They have momentum.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ignatieff knows he must avoid the pitiable fate of the Liberals' previous leader, Stephane Dion. Ignatieff knows Dion self-destructed by constantly supporting or doing nothing to stop Conservative legislation he had previously denounced. It was a death of 1,000 cuts, mostly self-inflicted, as Dion hemorrhaged confidence and credibility. Before he can be seriously considered as Harper's successor, Ignatieff must be seen as being the prime minister's match. That means standing up to Harper.</p>
<p>So far, Ignatieff looks pretty good. But he cannot afford to get carried away by overblown rhetoric. And he must not mistake good political drama for sound political policy.</p>
<p>This is not the time for an election. We had one last fall, one in January 2006 and one before that in the summer of 2004. They all produced the same thing: a minority government. There is little reason for Ignatieff to think that, despite a small surge in recent polls, he could change that pattern. Nor is there the slightest indication that Canadians are clamouring for another vote.</p>
<p>Besides, this is not merely a matter of politics, of who is in as government and who gets knocked out. Canada is wrestling with its worst recession in 60 years. Its soldiers are fighting a war. And there is, at the moment, the matter of a potential H1N1 influenza pandemic to deal with. These are extraordinarily hazardous times for this nation. If there were ever a time for political parties to subordinate their own interests to the greater national good, and locate broad common ground for co-operation, it is now. It's also hard to see how on any of these major national issues, the Liberals differ from the Conservatives enough to send voters to the polls.</p>
<p>So please, Mr. Ignatieff, stop talking about an election -- especially when your party hasn't even got a platform. Instead, find a way to influence the government without bringing it down; refine and improve Conservative initiatives without forcing an election that would, for many, many weeks, make it hard for the government to introduce any new initiatives whatsoever. And realize that before Canadians give you the opportunity to run the country, you should demonstrate that you can run the Liberal party.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>As the world wonders what the new H1N1 flu virus has in store for humankind, attention is shifting to south of the equator.</p>
<p>The Southern Hemisphere is going into its winter, a time best suited to the spread of influenza viruses, leading experts to wonder whether the virus will take off there and what the pattern of illness will be like if it does.</p>
<p>Lots could be learned in the Southern Hemisphere's winter about this newly emerged virus and the impact it will have on global health, Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, said yesterday.</p>
<p>"That will tell us a lot about whether the virus is changing, whether it's becoming more severe, and measures we might want to take in the fall,'' he said from Atlanta during a media teleconference.</p>
<p>It's not just the Southern Hemisphere that bears watching, said Dr. Scott Dowell, director of the CDC's division of global disease detection and emergency response.</p>
<p>"A lot of the disease burden that we're talking about in the off-season for the Northern Hemisphere is happening not just in the Southern Hemisphere, but also in the tropics,'' said Dowell, who noted the CDC has been helping a number of tropical countries set up and maintain surveillance systems for flu.</p>
<p>If the virus spreads to larger populations in more countries, the disease pattern or patterns -- there may be more than one, experts caution -- should start to come into focus.</p>
<p>Among the questions that could be answered are how many people become infected when the virus sweeps through an area -- something scientists call the attack rate.</p>
<p>Another is whether this new virus will crowd out the current crop of influenza A strains because more people are susceptible to it. It is flu dogma that a pandemic strain should sweep old influenza A subtypes off the board. But flu dogma is rewritten often enough that it's anyone's bet whether or how this new virus will co-exist with older ones.</p>
<p>Scientists also want to know whether the virus remains sensitive to the two main flu drugs, Tamiflu and Relenza, Besser said, as well as whether the virus mutates in ways that could affect attempts to make a vaccine against it.</p>
<p>Answering some of these questions may be a challenge if the illness caused by the virus remains largely mild. While Australia and New Zealand have sophisticated flu surveillance systems, the same cannot be said of large parts of Africa and South America.</p>
<p>Spotting mild flu cases in areas where other illnesses are a more likely cause of fever and flu-like symptoms could be difficult.</p>
<p>"If this new swine flu comes in some countries like Mauritania or Guinea or something, nobody will really see this,'' said Dr. Ousmane Diop, head of the unit of medical virology at the <span class="companylink">Institut Pasteur</span> in Dakar, Senegal.</p>

</p>
<p>An Alberta girl with no apparent link to Mexico is in hospital with Canada's first reported severe case of swine flu -- a sign the nasty bug is now spreading in Canada.</p>
<p>Public health officials acknowledged yesterday the H1N1 influenza is infecting those with no immediately obvious connections to Mexico.</p>
<p>Federal officials reported 41 new cases yesterday, bringing the total to 140 across the country.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, the chief public health officer, said news of the more severe case "although disconcerting, is not surprising and does not change our course of action.''</p>
<p>Health officials in Alberta confirmed earlier in the day that a girl from the Edmonton area was in hospital with severe symptoms.</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau, the province's chief medical officer of health, declined to give the girl's age or provide specific information about he symptoms.</p>
<p>"She is currently under care and is doing well,'' he said. "It is the first time that we have a case that requires hospitalization. All the other cases that we have had so far, which has been the pattern pretty much around the world outside of Mexico, (have been) mild and are recovering uneventfully.''</p>
<p>The girl was admitted to hospital on Thursday. Health officials would not say if her condition is potentially life-threatening.</p>
<p>Dr. Gerry Predy of Alberta Health Services said the province was not planning any school closures as a result of the girl's severe case of the flu.</p>
<p>He said there is no evidence the girl or members of her family have visited Mexico.</p>
<p>"Federal health officials were at a loss to explain why the girl got so sick.</p>
<p>"We don't really have anything specific to say why this person is iller than other people,'' Butler-Jones said. "It's obviously a combination of factors -- both the virus, genetic factors and others. When it comes to immunity, we all respond a little bit differently.''</p>
<p>He said that the Alberta girl's more severe illness is typical of normal flu patterns.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, China and several other countries banned Alberta's pork after some 220 hogs were quarantined on a farm in the province after catching the H1N1 influenza A virus from a worker who had been in Mexico.</p>
<p>Canadian politicians and health officials said the bans are unjustified since there is no proof the virus can be spread by eating properly cooked or cured pork.</p>

<p>Confirmed death toll in Mexico (U.S. death toll: one)</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>Confirmed cases in Canada. (38 in Nova Scotia, 31 in Ontario, 39 in British Columbia, 24 in Alberta, three in Quebec, two in Prince Edward Island, two in New Brunswick and one in Manitoba).</p>
<p>727</p>
<p>Confirmed cases in Mexico</p>
<p>Confirmed cases elsewhere: 300 in U.S.; 44 in Spain; 27 in Britain; eight in Germany; six in New Zealand; four in Israel, Italy and France; two in El Salvador; one each in Austria, Costa Rica, Colombia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Korea and Switzerland.</p>
<p>WHO alert level: Phase 5 -- Human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region, a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, communication, and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short.</p>
<p>Latest developments:</p>
<p>Canada reports first severe case, a young girl in hospital in Edmonton. Ontario's caseload alone more than doubles to 31.</p>
<p>29 students from the Universite de Montreal, all but six of them Canadian, placed in preventive quarantine in a hotel in the city of Changchun in northern China. Several other Canadian tourists in quarantine in a Hong Kong hotel. None have shown symptoms.</p>
<p>Mexico lashes out at perception of discrimination against Mexican nationals in countries around the world, notably China, and at the decision by several countries to ban flights from Mexico.</p>
<p>International Trade Minister Stockwell Day denounces Chinese ban on Alberta pork, imposed after Alberta swine herd tests positive for the virus, as "disappointing and unwarranted,'' says Canadian officials are ensuring several countries that have banned pork imports are aware of the facts.</p>
<p>World Health Organization says slaughtering pigs unnecessary because virus is being spread through humans; says swine herd in Canada likely infected by farmworker who returned from Mexico.</p>
<p>Symptoms: Fever, lethargy, lack of appetite and coughing; some report runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>Transmission: Believed to occur through coughing or sneezing, or touching contaminated surfaces before touching mouth or nose.</p>
<p>Advice: Health officials urge those with flu-like symptoms to avoid work or school, wash hands, cough into sleeves and get medical attention.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Just how sick people will get remains to be seen, says director of diseases; Flu numbers swell in Ontario</b>

<div>855 words</div><div>5 May 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus will likely infect between three million and 4.2 million Ontarians -- up to 35 per cent of the population -- before it runs its course, says a key public health official.</p>
<p>But just how sick people will get remains to be seen, Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious diseases with the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, said yesterday, adding there is lots of "crystal-ball gazing'' happening.</p>
<p>"It's definitely not a bunch of hype, in my opinion. That doesn't mean that humanity is in big trouble,'' he said. "I still don't think we've seen enough of it to really comment on how mild it is. We've only seen 1,000 cases outside of Mexico.''</p>
<p>The provincial government revealed yesterday the number of Ontarians hit with the bug has almost doubled and now stands at 31. There are 24 cases in the Greater Toronto Area.</p>
<p>There are also four cases in Windsor-Essex and one case in each Oxford, Simcoe-Muskoka and the Sudbury area. As of late yesterday afternoon, there were no confirmed cases in Waterloo Region.</p>
<p>All cases have been "mild'' with no one requiring hospitalization.</p>
<p>Ontario is prepared to roll out its "pandemic plan,'' modelled on a "moderately severe'' pandemic, affecting up to 4.5 million people, Gardam said. These assumptions are based on the 1957 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>The "moderately severe'' scenario assumes that up to 13,000 people would die from the bug, up to 54,000 people would require hospitalization and 2.4 million would become sick enough to see a doctor. Up to two million would become sick enough to take a day or two off work.</p>
<p>"The thing is, you can't predict how serious it's going to be. Maybe it will give two billion people in the world a nasty cold and it won't actually cause excess mortality,'' Gardam said.</p>
<p>The province's hospitals are already full, so there is a question about where 54,000 extra hospital beds would come from (in the scenario of a moderately severe pandemic). Primary health-care providers, including family doctors and nurse practitioners, would be hard pressed to accommodate all the patients wanting to seem them.</p>
<p>"Image one in five people wanting to see their doctor over and eight to 12 week period for flu. That's a big deal for a doctor,'' Gardam exclaimed.</p>
<p>Allison Stuart, assistant deputy minister of public health, told a news conference that in the event of a pandemic, hospitals would try to make room for flu patients by discharging some other patients early, moving patients into community care and cancelling or delaying some procedures.</p>
<p>"It doesn't mean that should we be full phase 6 (on the WHO pandemic scale) that hospitals will not still be challenged from a space perspective,'' she cautioned.</p>
<p>She explained the province would also, in the event of a pandemic, open "flu centres'' where people could get vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>The impact of a pandemic would be exacerbated by people taking time off work. For example, if bus drivers get the bug, bus service could be affected.</p>
<p>Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting medical officer of health, said there is a possibility Ontario could get hit with a second wave of swine flu in the fall. Flu bugs don't like humidity and the caseload tends to go down in the summer.</p>
<p>Gardam said when it comes to the flu there is always a lot of conjecture.</p>
<p>"It's going around in circles with people hypothesizing, 'Oh well, it's going to die out' (or) 'Oh, it's going to be bad next fall,"' he said. "The thing with the flu is that it's all crystal ball gazing. You can't really predict what it's going to do,'' he added.</p>
<p>There is much excitement about this strain of H1N1 because it is a new strain and people do not have antibodies against it, unlike a typical seasonal flu for which people usually have some pre-existing immunity, Gardam explained.</p>
<p>If there is a second wave of the virus in the fall, Williams said the province would be prepared to inoculate Ontarians with a special flu shot. This would be in addition to the regular flu shot the province offers, which is already in production and is based on other strains of the flu.</p>
<p>Eleven men and 20 women have contracted the virus with the age range of cases being between four and 50. Williams said there is no need to close schools in the province.</p>
<p>Williams said he expected the number to rise as daily testing increases. So far, 1,900 Ontarians have been tested for H1N1 with up to 350 tests now being done daily, a number that will rise to 450 by Friday.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>There are now 31 confirmed cases of the H1N1 flu virus in Ontario. None of them are local.</p>
<p>Although several swabs and samples were taken and sent to the lab for testing last week, results have not been returned. And that may be a good sign.</p>
<p>The tests are first run on high priority cases, such as samples taken from the elderly, infants and people with immune deficiencies.</p>
<p>"We have the possibility of only one that fits that criteria," said local medical officer Dr. Nicola Mercer, who oversees Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health.</p>
<p>"We thought we should be getting some results back by this point, but the public health lab is waiting on a number of cases and prioritizes them by higher risk groups."</p>
<p>Lab testing has increased to about 350 cases a day and will jump by another 50 to 100 cases by the end of this week, according to Lucia Zdeb, communications specialist for Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health.</p>
<p>On another slightly positive note, Mercer said the H1N1 influenza virus is "behaving very much like a seasonal flu."</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean it will continue to do so, or make it any less virulent -- or potentially deadly.</p>
<p>Mercer said 400 people per year die of the flu in Ontario, but that even the deadliness of the common flu "depends on the individual's underlying medical conditions."</p>
<p>Yesterday, health officials in Alberta said a young girl from the Edmonton area had been hospitalized with a severe case of H1N1 flu -- the first person to be hospitalized due to the illness.</p>
<p>"It's very reassuring that the majority of people . . . have recovered at home," Mercer said.</p>
<p>Despite those reassurances, Mercer is warning people to proceed with caution if they feel they have any of the symptoms of the flu.</p>
<p>"That's not the time to go to a social gathering," she said. "You need to stay home and see what happens. You need to stay home for seven days or until 24 hours after you feel better.</p>
<p>"Our message is still the same. If you've been Mexico and you feel well, continue to go about your normal business."</p>

</p>
<p>Talk about timing. Just as swine flu or H1N1 flu is entrenching itself into the global psyche, the University of Guelph launches a centre for public health and zoonoses.</p>
<p>The centre officially opened yesterday. It's described as a one-of-a-kind facility aimed at preventing and controlling emerging animal-related diseases that threaten public health. Some of these diseases are called zoonotic, meaning they can be transferred between humans and animals.</p>
<p>Planning launches such as this takes months to co-ordinate. You can't get the chief veterinary officer for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the chief veterinarian for the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs to an event overnight.</p>
<p>The university was well on the way toward this opening before the latest flu arrived on the scene.</p>
<p>But the timing doesn't hurt the centre's chances of gaining some coincidental profile. Publishers, editors and producers are keenly aware that their readers, listeners and viewers will take at least some comfort knowing a reputable, arm's-length institution is working in a new way toward dealing with zoonotic diseases and public health.</p>
<p>The centre will give a focus for specialists at the Ontario Veterinary College, Ontario Agricultural College and elsewhere to address public health matters such as human swine flu, bird flu, E. coli 0157:H7 and West Nile virus. The centre has a superb pedigree. Numerous University of Guelph researchers have been in the news over the past couple of weeks, trying to help the media and the public sort out fact from fiction about H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>At times like these, a research-based centre with a public education and information interest drives home the reason investing in science is vital to the nation's health. The wrong information -- or public fear -- can have a devastating effect. In fact, many people are needlessly shunning retail pork for fear of getting the flu.</p>
<p>And, it's becoming clear that well-meaning border officials can't keep out H1N1 flu by banning pork meat imports. We need institutions such as the Centre for Public Health and Zoonoses to be vocal in telling people the truth -- such as, you do not get this strain of flu by eating pork.</p>
<p>We know, because we hear Canadian researchers such as Prof. Cate Dewey, a renowned population medicine specialist at the University of Guelph who focuses on the pork industry, tell national media the influenza is transmitted through the air, not through meat.</p>
<p>That's prompted many farm leaders and politicians, including U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, to ask that all swine references to the flu to be dropped. U.S. Democrats have even suggested any communication about the disease to constituents be void of pig-related graphics. After all, they say, even President Obama is calling it something other than swine flu. Shouldn't you?</p>
<p>Trying to put the disease in perspective is vital. The pork sector is struggling with chronically low prices, and associating it with an ill-named disease can only make matters worse. Already, dire predictions are coming forward about how this will obliterate the industry.</p>
<p>But somewhere along the line, we need a centre such as the new one at Guelph, equipped with social communication tools and media savvy, that can give concerned people answers to reasonable questions, such as "Why, if some experts say the virus doesn't really have much to do with pigs, was it first called swine flu?"</p>

<p>Re: 'MDs warn H1N1 cases may swamp their offices' (May 4) and other flu coverage</p>
<p>Regarding this media blitz on the coming "pandemic," I have only one thing to say: the media must really enjoy scaring the masses and just for the sake of profit.</p>
<p>It's always the same. Because of "digital" garbage, people are not reading paper newspapers like they used to and many such papers are going out of business. So what does the media do? It tries to scare the unsuspecting public.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to SARS? We kept hearing about the coming SARS pandemic back in 2002, but there never was a SARS pandemic.</p>
<p>The media talks about objectivity, yet their objective appears only to be the accumulation of wealth -- nothing more.</p>
<p>I'm really fed up with this media blitz.</p>

<p>Viewpoint: The Boston Globe</p>
<p>Another dangerous contagion is accompanying swine flu as it makes its way through the United States: the spread of ugly invective aimed at Mexicans, and xenophobia more generally about the outside world.</p>
<p>Calls to close the border with Mexico, kill massive herds of pigs, halt international trade, or quarantine people with dark skin are not supported by science and should be called out for what they are: paranoia.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, talk-show host Jay Severin was suspended by WTKK Radio (in Boston) for referring to Mexicans as "the world's lowest of primitives" and other, more juvenile slurs. He is hardly unique in this strain of bluster.</p>
<p>Nationally syndicated talk-show host Michael Savage speculated that Mexicans could be human weapons of germ warfare, set loose into America by our terrorist enemies. A Houston city councillor blasted a local hospital for even admitting the little boy who died from the virus -- the only confirmed death so far in the United States -- because he was visiting from Mexico.</p>
<p>In Egypt, the government ordered the slaughter of some 300,000 pigs, inflaming tensions between the Muslim government and the Christian minority that includes almost all the pig farmers in that volatile country. (Muslims do not eat pork.) This even though the World Health Organization is adamant that the virus is not food-borne and that no one has been infected through contact with pigs.</p>
<p>Closing international borders won't help contain the virus and could hurt, because it can slow down trade in vaccines and goods needed to treat a pandemic.</p>
<p>And there's a generalized misunderstanding about scale that inflates the threat of the new strain. In an ordinary year, flu causes about 36,000 deaths in the United States. So far, out of 140 confirmed cases in the United States as of Friday, the swine flu has caused one.</p>
<p>Naturally, cautions should be taken. In Lowell, Mass., the two boys who contracted the flu after visiting Mexico on a family vacation were right to stay home from school, and the Harvard dental school was wise to shut down its clinic and classrooms there while several suspected cases are confirmed.</p>
<p>But there are so many more important things to be concerned about that this new flu scare has brought into relief: the fact that 43 million Americans still don't have a health-care provider to advise or treat them if symptoms occur, for just one example.</p>
<p>Pointing fingers and stoking passions about "others" may satisfy a need for scapegoats. But Americans can do more to stay safe by simply washing their hands.</p>

<p>Beijing --</p>
<p>The Chinese government on Tuesday defended its decision to quarantine 22 Canadian students in a hotel in the northeast of the country, saying it was a legal response to the threat posed by the spread of the H1N1 flu virus and that the students in question approved of their situation.</p>
<p>However, a representative sent by the Canadian embassy in Beijing who travelled to the hotel was prevented from meeting with the students Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ma Zhaoxu, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, acknowledged that none of the students showed any symptoms of having the deadly flu, but said the government of Jilin province was nonetheless within its rights to quarantine them for seven days.</p>
<p>“Given that, on May 2, Canada had confirmed 51 cases of human infections of the H1N1 flu, in order to protect public sanitation and safety, the Jilin provincial authorities in accordance with the law on infectious diseases, conducted seven-day medical observations towards Canadian students in Changchun city,” Mr. Ma told a press conference in Beijing. He said the students were placed under quarantine on Saturday and the Canadian Embassy in Beijing was notified the following day.</p>
<p>Two German students and one from an unknown African country are also under quarantine at the same hotel outside Changchung, an industrial city 300 kilometres from China's border with North Korea. They were taking part in the same language-learning program arranged by the University of Montreal as the other students.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma said the students were healthy and being well cared for. “The relative Chinese officials have made considerable and appropriate arrangements for their accommodations, food and drink, and health checks. I can tell you that those students' temperatures are normal. They are healthy and in a good condition, and they are in a stable emotional state. They expressed satisfaction with what Chinese side has arranged for them.”</p>
<p>That assertion conflicted with the accounts given by some of the students, who described being singled out on their flight from Beijing to Changchun solely because they were Canadian. One student said conditions inside the hotel were dull but bearable.</p>
<p>“Everyone is feeling great, no one is sick. Spirits are good, but slowly declining,” Martin Deslauriers, a 26-year-old East Asian Studies major at University of Montreal, said in a telephone interview. “We can go outside, there's a ping-pong table. And they have given us some beers so that really helps.”</p>
<p>Mr. Deslauriers said the Canadian embassy had sent a representative to try and meet with the students Tuesday, but that he had been prevented from entering the hotel by Chinese authorities. “They told him that if he entered the facility to see is, he would have to be placed under quarantine too. It's strange, because the people working in the hotel aren't even wearing masks.”</p>
<p>Mr. Deslauriers identified the diplomat as Dial Singh, the first secretary and consul of the Canadian embassy in Beijing.</p>
<p>Embassy spokesman Patrice Cousineau said the embassy has asked the Chinese government to clarify why the students are being quarantined. “We want to understand why they're under quarantine. All we want to know are the exact reasons behind this,” he said.</p>
<p>The Chinese government on Tuesday also defended its decision to bar the import of Alberta pork and pork products after a herd 220 of pigs on a central Alberta farm was found to be infected with H1N1, the virus also known as swine flu. Ottawa has threatened to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization if Beijing leaves the measure in place, arguing that Alberta pork poses no risks since the virus cannot be transmitted from animals to humans, or through food.</p>
<p>“In order to protect the safety of our animal husbandry and the people's health, the Chinese government has no choice but to take temporary preventive and protective measures,” Mr. Ma said. “These urgent protective measures are ... consistent with WTO regulations on strict quarantine measures in emergencies and the principle of minimizing the impact on trade.”</p>
<p>“The way this flu works is still very unclear,” Mr. Ma added.</p>
<p>Both the students' quarantine and the Alberta pork ban are expected to be high on the agenda when Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon arrives in Beijing this weekend for a five-day visit. The trip, expected to be largely a relationship-rebuilding process after years of rocky ties between Canada and China, was in the works well before the H1N1 crisis broke out.</p>
<p>The University of Montreal students aren't the only apparently healthy individuals being quarantined in China. More than 300 guests – including an unknown number of Canadian citizens – have been under lockdown in a Hong Kong hotel since last week after a Mexican man, who is the only confirmed case so far of H1N1 in China, briefly stayed there.</p>
<p>The United States embassy said Tuesday that at least four of its citizens had been quarantined in China in recent days, though two of those have reportedly since been released.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Mexican government, which has complained vociferously about China's “discriminatory” treatment of its nationals – on Tuesday chartered an AeroMexico plane that arrived in China to pick up dozens of Mexican citizens who had been placed under quarantine despite showing no flu symptoms.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>City hoteliers unfazed by flu threat; Despite several tour cancellations, most think a SARS repeat unlikely</b>

</p>
<p>At least one Victoria hotel has had a major tour group from Asia cancel its trip here because of fears over the human swine flu epidemic but hoteliers and industry analysts are unfazed, citing other windfalls related to the influenza that will keep tourism healthy.</p>
<p>The Hotel Grand Pacific lost a contract with an Asian tour company that was set to bring 100 students here for two nights at the end of May, said Brian Friesen, the hotel's director of sales and marketing.</p>
<p>"It was a considerable group so we're very concerned about that," Friesen said, adding the hotel has done business with the tour operator in the past.</p>
<p>A small group of three people cancelled its three-night stay at the Inn at Laurel Point this past weekend, said hotel manager Scott Hoadley, but he said the impact was fairly insignificant.</p>
<p>"It was a group from Japan that was advised [by government officials] that they couldn't come," he said.</p>
<p>Earl Wilde, president of the B.C. Hotel Association and the Victoria Regent Hotel's general manager said some hotels have had "minor cancellations" because of the H1N1 virus, especially from Asian tour groups "but it's certainly not widespread."</p>
<p>"The way it's reported in foreign countries is simply sort of 'don't go there' and the world has become a very small place" he said.</p>
<p>But a repeat of the SARS crisis that gave worldwide tourism a beating in 2003 is unlikely, said Chemistry Consulting Group partner Frank Burree.</p>
<p>SARS was responsible for 800 deaths worldwide, including 44 in Toronto and along with the 9/11 terrorism attacks and passport confusion contributed to a deadly cocktail for Canadian tourism.</p>
<p>The Canadian Tourism Commission estimates SARS cost the Canadian economy $722 million between 2003 and 2006 and contributed to thousands of jobs losses.</p>
<p>"We're not look at the kind of numbers that we were seeing with SARS," Burree said.</p>
<p>Tourism Victoria was just as bullish.</p>
<p>"At this point swine flu is a reason for concern for the tourism industry but not for alarm," said spokeswoman Kelsi Woodward.</p>
<p>Influenza scares have yet to threaten individual leisure travellers, Friesen said.</p>
<p>He pointed to the possibility that domestic travellers who have ditched their Cancun holidays might come to sunny Victoria instead.</p>
<p>And just last week the local tourism industry was beaming over the several thousand cruise passengers unloaded at Ogden Point by the two largest cruise ships to ever visit the city -- the Carnival Splendor and Royal Caribbean's Mariner of the Seas -- which rerouted from ports in</p>
<p>Mexico and will make a total of 21 stops this summer.</p>
<p>International travel to Mexico, the epicentre of the outbreak, has virtually ground to a halt over the human swine flu outbreak, and concern has been raised that the U.S. and Canada, the second and third hardest hit countries, could also be sworn off by panicked travellers.</p>
<p>Canada now has 140 confirmed cases of swine flu including the first severe case in Alberta.</p>
<p>Countries such as India, Malaysia and Vietnam have advised citizens to limit non-essential travel to countries with confirmed cases, including Canada.</p>
<p>The European Union advised member countries to caution against travel to both the Mexico and United States but has issued no such warning against Canada.</p>
<p>"These travel restrictions won't do anything to stop the spread of this virus," Friesen said.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization urged nations to avoid restrictions on international travel.</p>
<p>It's still premature to tell how swine flu will effect tourism in North American, said Wilde, but he pointed out that things here in Victoria could be a lot worse.</p>
<p>"We can be thankful we're not hoteliers in Mexico."</p>
