<div id="hd"><b>Political deaths if pandemic prevention fails; However, vaccine rollout may come early</b>
</div><div>Don Martin   </div>

<div>781 words</div><div>8 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>There's still an element of finger-crossing in the pandemic prevention plan, but sources say Canada's H1N1 vaccine will be ready ahead of schedule, likely rolling out as early as next week to set up an injection blitz starting before month's end.</p>
<p>The sole Canadian H1N1 vaccine producer, GlaxoSmith-Kline, is apparently playing it safe by posting a worst-case delivery date of early November, but representatives have quietly told Conservative Cabinet ministers that shipments will likely commence before the third week of October after clinical trials wrap up.</p>
<p>An early delivery is good news for the federal government, which is squirming under the lousy optics of high-risk patients now being immunized in Europe and the United States while the most vulnerable Canadians anxiously await their vaccine injection.</p>
<p>If, as originally scheduled, the vaccine didn't reach clinics until mid-November when the highly contagious swine flu could be peaking, the government's autumn honeymoon could have ended in widespread public anger at the health ministry's lack of preparedness.</p>
<p>An early delivery also dampens criticism of exclusive vaccine provider GSK. One representative of a rival American manufacturer confided to me this week that multiple suppliers (the United States has five) would've guaranteed Canadians earlier access to the vaccine. He argues, from an obvious conflict-of-interest position, that Canada should expand the number of suppliers of future pandemic vaccines to ensure a competitively priced and reliable supply.</p>
<p>Canada inked a 10-year contract for subsidized vaccine production with a small company called <span class="companylink">ID Biomedical</span> that was taken over a few times before being absorbed by GSK in 2005. That pharmaceutical giant has also been contracted for the bulk of Canada's seasonal flu vaccines, which it scrambled to</p>
<p>produce in tandem with the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Another concern is how the provinces are posting a hodgepodge of protocols on the sequencing of their immunization blitz against seasonal and swine flu.</p>
<p>A still-secret study of 2,000 Canadians, which has attracted worldwide attention and a fair amount of medical scorn, found a link between a patient's seasonal vaccination history and increased vulnerability to H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>That sent provinces scrambling to post a mix of vaccine rules. Quebec will hold off the seasonal flu injection until after the pandemic vaccination; next-door Ontario will offer only seniors the regular flu shot until the H1N1 vaccine is ready to roll; Alberta will launch with a seasonal shot for everybody, suspend it during the pandemic vaccination, and resume again later in the year.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, there is considerable government concern that the largest immunization effort in Canadian history must roll out smoothly on schedule, knowing a miscalculation could have deadly impact on the government's health, never mind the victims.</p>
<p>So far there have been, like the flu strain itself, minor ailments on the file with no near-death political experiences.</p>
<p>True, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq sounded a tad cold-hearted Wednesday by refusing to apologize to a small Manitoba native community for shipping them 30 body bags in September, even if a government-produced report on the incident released yesterday largely absolved the ministry of blame.</p>
<p>But while the heavily scripted rookie from Iqaluit may never score top honours for fast-thinking on her feet, she deserves credit for gamely trying to keep Canadians informed with regular updates on the swine flu's progress.</p>
<p>It's also a tad strange how public health officer David Butler-Jones has placed so much emphasis on handwashing to fend off the infection when the Canadian Medical Association Journal concluded in 2007 that it didn't do much of anything to prevent an outbreak.</p>
<p>But this much is a medical certainty, according to Dr. Butler-Jones: A pandemic is approaching Canada's west coast that could become three times more prevalent than regular flu. At that rate it would infect up to 30% of the population, probably before Christmas, although predictions on the severity of the flu vary.</p>
<p>While the strain appears mercifully mild so far, suggesting the doomsday run on respirators and body bags might not materialize, 30% is still roughly the percentage of Canadians hit by the Spanish flu of 1918.</p>
<p>The difference is that they didn't have a vaccine in 1918. And that means the 50,000 lives that pandemic claimed should, hopefully, remain a thing of the past.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>RESERVE, NOT MINISTRY, ORDERED 100 BODY BAGS</b>
</div><div>Kathryn Blaze Carlson   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>546 words</div><div>8 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p>Despite speculation that Health Canada ordered a controversial shipment of body bags to Manitoba's Wasagamack First Nation, the delivery was requested by the community's nursing station in preparation for a possible second wave of H1N1 pandemic, according to a much-anticipated report released yesterday by the Deputy Minister of Health.</p>
<p>Health Canada previously admitted it had "erred" in sending the body bags, but the report said it was Wasagamack's nurse-in-charge who ordered 100 body bags on Aug. 12.</p>
<p>"It was a clear over-estimation," Minister of Health Leona Aglukkaq told a news conference yesterday, adding there was no evidence of ill-will.</p>
<p>"The person who placed the order made a bit of an error in requesting so much," echoed Grand Chief Ron Evans of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs.</p>
<p>"Had this person consulted with community leadership, the chief would have known that this sort of shipment would frighten people. This shows the need for better communication across all parties, including Health Canada."</p>
<p>The government-produced report said that while the nurse-in-charge was acting under the recommendation to "order generously" given the community's isolation, the request for 100 body bags was "disproportionately high in comparison to quantities in nursing stations across the country."</p>
<p>Of the 100 body bags requested, 38 were delivered to Wasagamack by Sept. 9, while the rest of the shipment, which had been on back order, was cancelled on Sept. 16 after the Winnipeg regional office was made aware of the abnormally large request.</p>
<p>That same day, Wasagamack's Chief Jerry Knott made headlines across the country after he returned 18 body bags to the Winnipeg office, calling the delivery a grim message from the federal government that his community would not fare well in the event of a second wave.</p>
<p>"Everything sort of skyrocketed," Grand Chief Evans said. "In the heat of the moment, one can understand why things turned out the way it did. It sort of spread like wildfire."</p>
<p>Indeed, the shipment sparked massive outcry among aboriginal leaders who likened the delivery to sending body bags to soldiers in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Grand Chief David Harper, who represents 30 northern Manitoba First Nations communities, called for the resignation of Jim Wolfe, regional director of Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit health branch. Meantime, Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff demanded Ms. Aglukkaq explain the shipment and apologize for sending the message that federal authorities "expect aboriginal Canadians to die."</p>
<p>Yesterday's report said Health Canada recognizes the "anxiety and alarm" caused by the Wasagamack incident, and recommends that the Ministry impose maximum quantity limits and develop a mechanism to flag unusual orders.</p>
<p>"I am confident that everything has been done to ensure that this will not happen again," Ms. Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>Although she said Health Canada supplies "small quantities of body bags to some isolated First Nations communities," the report said the amount ordered by Wasagamack is 10 times more than what is usually stocked at nursing stations.</p>
<p>Aboriginal communities bore the brunt of the spring H1N1 outbreak. First Nations or Metis people living on or off-reserve make up nearly 40% of the 891 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus to date.</p>

</div><div>Paul Vieira   </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>630 words</div><div>8 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>FP6</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Canada fired yesterday its latest shot to push the United States to repeal a controversial meat labelling law by formally asking the World Trade Organization to issue its own judgment over whether the legislation passes muster.</p>
<p>The federal government said the formal request was necessary after months of WTOsupervised negotiations between the two countries failed to produce a resolution. The WTO will now hold a quasi-judicial hearing to determine the outcome, and it normally takes up to nine months for a judgment to be issued.</p>
<p>The trade dispute concerns a meat-labelling law, known as COOL, or country-of-original labelling, that requires meat and other foods sold at U.S. supermarkets to have labels that indicate from which countries the food originates. On top of that, the Obama administration has asked the U.S. meat-packing industry to undertake additional "voluntary" measures that are not in the law, including that labels be included on processed meats.</p>
<p>"The U.S. COOL requirements are so onerous that they affect the ability of our cattle and hog exporters to compete fairly in the U.S. market," Stockwell Day, the International Trade Minister, said in a statement. "That is why our government has no choice but to request a WTO panel. This request demonstrates our ongoing commitment to resolving this issue and defending the interests of Canadian producers."</p>
<p>The move comes amid recent programs unveiled by the federal government, totalling nearly $100-million, to help hog farmers either temporarily exit the industry or seek new markets for their livestock. These measures are meant to mitigate the fallout from export losses, due to trade restrictions such as the labelling law or bans sparked by the initial outbreak of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Previously, Canadian officials believed they had a resolution over COOL with the former Bush administration but that changed after the Democrats took control of the White House.</p>
<p>Trade lawyers have said Canada's case is solid, as the labelling requirements put Canadian products at a disadvantage, which is not allowed under global trade rules. U.S. meat packers are said to be unwilling to buy Canadian livestock due to the additional paperwork the law entails.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, Ron Kirk, the U.S. Trade Representative, and Tom Vilsack, the U.S. Agriculture Secretary, said they believe the U.S. labelling rule obeys all the conditions set out by the WTO.</p>
<p>"Countries have agreed since long before the existence of the WTO that country of origin labelling is a legitimate policy. It is common for other countries to require that goods be labelled as to their origin," they said.</p>
<p>The Canadian Pork Council endorsed Ottawa's WTO request, arguing the U.S. legislation has caused U.S. pork processors to cease buying Canadian-raised livestock.</p>
<p>"[It] is a welcome signal that our government understands the impact COOL is having on our producers and that they will continue to work with the livestock sector to defend our WTO trade rights," said Jurgen Preugschas, council president and a hog farmer in Mayerthorpe, Alta.</p>
<p>The WTO challenge comes as the two countries tried to find a resolution over Congress's "Buy American" provisions, which would prohibit Canadian manufacturers to supply goods for projects funded by Washington's nearly US$1-trillion stimulus package. Ottawa is trying to get an exemption by opening up the provinces' procurement markets to U.S. suppliers. At present, provinces can openly discriminate against foreign firms.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Kendall: We can handle H1N1 patients; Shortage of staff to operate ventilating machines a concern</b>
</div><div>Richard Watts </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>423 words</div><div>7 October 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist </div>
</p>
<p>B.C. health officials remain confident hospitals can handle the influx of H1N1 swine flu patients despite recent reports warning of a ventilating machines shortage.</p>
<p>"Doing things appropriately, in terms of trying to reduce [ventilator] demand and making sure that you've got the capacity there, we should be able to manage through this," said Dr. Perry Kendall, B.C. Chief Medical Health Officer.</p>
<p>Kendall was reacting to reports of a draft study warning the province may not have enough ventilating machines (total 976) to cope with an increase in demand from H1N1 patients.</p>
<p>That study has since been sent back to the consultant for further examination, with instructions to look at hospitalization rates from H1N1 experienced recently in Australia and New Zealand. For the draft report the consultant used data from the last known flu pandemic in 1968.</p>
<p>Kendall said to exceed B.C.'s ventilator capacity the province would have to experience hospitalization rates three times as high as peak demands experienced in Australia and New Zealand and 20 times as high as the off-peak times.</p>
<p>But he also said the experience in the southern hemisphere has shown H1N1 has had its biggest impact on hospital's critical care units and their respirators. "Intensive care units and respirators has emerged as the critical choke point."</p>
<p>"If you've only got 25 beds and you've got 35 people wanting them, then that becomes an issue," said Kendall.</p>
<p>Plans and measures are already underway to manage the demand on those units with their ventilators, said Kendall.</p>
<p>These measures include preparing to postpone some surgeries, like heart and lungs, to free up ventilator capacity during the H1N1 season. And moves are already underway to get anti-viral drugs delivered quickly to patients, whose pre-existing health conditions put them at risk of complications that would require them to go on a ventilator machine.</p>
<p>On Vancouver Island, officials have always said the limiting factor is not the number of machines, but the professional staff to operate them.</p>
<p>Although the Vancouver Island Health Authority has about 80 machines of varying capacities, only 26 patients can be simultaneously placed on ventilating systems at the biggest facilities for H1N1, the Royal Jubilee, the Victoria General and the Nanaimo Regional General Hospital.</p>
<p>Nurses and technicians trained to manage patients on respirators are being readied for redeployment back to intensive care units to boost capacity.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Seasonal flu shot urged for at-risk - Regardless of H1N1 fears, top health official says</b>
</div><div>By Aldo Santin </div>

</p>
<p>THE province's senior health official says people most at risk for complications from seasonal influenza should get the seasonal flu vaccine regardless of their concerns about contracting the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Dr. Joel Kettner, the chief provincial public health officer, said new evidence is emerging that shows there is no link between getting the seasonal flu vaccine and the likelihood of developing a severe case of the H1N1 pandemic flu.</p>
<p>"What we've told people is regardless of your own perceived risk for H1N1," those most at risk of the seasonal flu should get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Kettner said the provincial government believes it only has a limited amount of time to administer the seasonal flu vaccine before its attention will be focused on the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>"We want to prioritize those we think would benefit most from the seasonal flu shot."</p>
<p>Health officials were concerned when a report emerged that showed a link between the seasonal flu vaccine and H1N1, Kettner said, but there were many questions about the validity of that study.</p>
<p>In the last two weeks, evidence has emerged to show it's safe to administer the seasonal flu vaccine to those who need it the most.</p>
<p>"Based on what we know now about the study that caused all the concern and based on what we know now about other studies, we feel much more confident... that there is very little, if any evidence, that getting the seasonal flu shot increases your risk for pandemic influenza (H1N1), especially severe pandemic influenza," Kettner said.</p>
<p>Winnipeg Regional Health Authority officials said during a Monday news conference that people age 65 and older are at risk for complications of seasonal influenza, but seem less likely to acquire the H1N1 flu than younger people. Others who are at risk for seasonal influenza are also at risk for H1N1.</p>
<p>If people fall within the groups that are most at risk for both seasonal influenza and H1N1, Kettner said, they should get the seasonal flu vaccine now and they will be at the top of the list when the H1N1 vaccine is available.</p>
<p>Kettner said there is no reason why otherwise healthy people should not get the seasonal flu shot at workplace flu clinics, unless their doctor recommends against it.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health region cuts services to battle flu</b>
</div><div>James Wood </div>
<div>The StarPhoenix</div>
<div>647 words</div><div>7 October 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>
</p>
<p>The Saskatoon Health Region confirmed Tuesday it will scale back public health services in order to do mass immunizations for the H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Deputy medical health officer Dr. Ross Findlater said details are still being finalized but the services affected will be similar to those announced Tuesday by the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region -- child health clinics, prenatal classes, breastfeeding support and immunizations for children.</p>
<p>"It will involve fewer of the services that we normally do," said Findlater, who added a formal announcement may come as soon as today.</p>
<p>"The things that are the most important you want to continue as much as you can, as close to a normal service as you can. But really, we don't have any options if we're trying to immunize as much of the population that wants the vaccine within about a four-week period. There just aren't enough people to do that without deferring some of our normal public health services."</p>
<p>Findlater said some people seeking appointments for services such as vaccination for a child during the period of H1N1 immunization have already been deferred. H1N1 vaccinations are expected to begin in November.</p>
<p>In Regina, children due for the regular two-, four-, six- and 12-month immunizations will still receive them on schedule, but the 18-month and four-year booster immunizations will happen at a later date. As well, breastfeeding support services have been consolidated from two locations to one, prenatal classes have been temporarily shelved and a travel health clinic will offer reduced services after Oct. 26.</p>
<p>The health regions are acting on the recommendation of the province but each plan may be slightly different, depending on how much resources the region can bring to bear.</p>
<p>Judy Junor, the Opposition NDP's health critic, said this week she's concerned the provincial government isn't doing enough to provide assistance to the health regions around mass vaccinations.</p>
<p>"It's all going to be done by public health, which is woefully understaffed. And they're going to deal with potentially a million immunizations? And now I'm seeing that public health is getting direction they're to cancel a lot of their programs, programs that deal with pregnant women. Well, that's one of the demographics that are going to be hit. So you should be reaching out to them. You shouldn't be cancelling your ordinary programs," she said.</p>
<p>Junor noted other provinces have recruited recently retired nurses to backstop immunization programs, which has not taken place in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan Party Health Minister Don McMorris said it is up to the health regions to determine their personnel needs in response to H1N1.</p>
<p>"I think the biggest problem for health regions is we just don't know, they don't know, what the uptake of the H1N1 vaccine will be because there's certainly lots of numbers thrown out there. We're ready for 75 per cent of the population but there are some numbers saying it may only be 40 per cent, so the (human resources) requirement is a tough one to hit," he said Tuesday, adding the province is prepared if and when an influenza pandemic hits.</p>
<p>Findlater said recruiting for an unspecified number of temporary public health nurses has taken place in Saskatoon but there aren't sufficient numbers of retired nurses "to be a big part of any solution here."</p>
<p>Doctors' offices, which normally give seasonal flu vaccinations, will also be given the H1N1 vaccine, he said.</p>
<p>The province announced last month that regular seasonal flu vaccinations will not take place, except for people aged 65 and older and those living in long-term care homes, because of the greater threat of H1N1.</p>
<p>The government said resources were not an issue in the decision.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>The window of opportunity for accelerating the pandemic-flu vaccination program in Canada may be starting to close, unless word of a change of plans comes soon, experts suggested yesterday.</p>
<p>But despite pressure to speed up the start of the program, the country's chief public health officer continued to insist that the projected start date of early November is still the target.</p>
<p>The early November start will allow Health Canada to follow the regulatory process it set out for approving the pandemic vaccine, Dr. David Butler-Jones said yesterday.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall, British Columbia's chief medical officer of health, said provinces and territories would need at least a week or two of notice to get clinics organized and staffed if the start date is going to change.</p>

</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>

</p>
<p>Details for the virtual summit on H1N1 that was promised last month are still being worked on, according to Assembly of First Nations National Chief Shawn Atleo, who said Tuesday he is anxious for the event to take place.</p>
<p>It will be an opportunity to bring many issues to the fore on a national level and to ensure that progress is being made on some of the problems that have arisen since the pandemic began in the spring.</p>
<p>"I think it provides us all with strong motivation that we get organized," Atleo told Canwest News Service in an interview following his first appearance as the newly elected AFN national chief before the House of Commons committee on aboriginal affairs.</p>
<p>The virtual summit, which Atleo says will happen later this month or in early November, is part of a communications protocol that was signed by himself, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and Indian Affairs and Northern Development Minister Chuck Strahl in the wake of the body bag uproar.</p>
<p>The federal government has faced criticism for failing to help first nations communities prepare for the pandemic and a number of controversies have cropped up since several isolated reserves were hit particularly hard in the first wave of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Most recently, body bags were included in shipments of health-care supplies to some communities which sparked outrage and accusations that the government was ignoring pleas for help to cope with illnesses and, instead, insensitively sent an ominous message about what might be in store for first nations people when the pandemic is expected to worsen this fall and winter.</p>
<p>Atleo said the body bags were received with "great horror" and that cultural sensitivities were not taken into account.</p>
<p>"It's like inviting death and we've got to be very careful about recognizing cultural practices in our communities. It ties back to my interest in pushing for enhanced communications and planning protocols," he said.</p>
<p>The day after the controversy erupted Health Canada explained that the post-mortem kits are part of regular shipments of supplies but the department apologized for sending so many and acknowledged its overestimation of how many were needed caused fear among residents.</p>
<p>"I'm hoping that, while a very unfortunate situation causing deep trauma for community members, that we turn this into a strong suggestion that we do things differently," said Atleo.</p>
<p>Mixed messages from all levels of government and areas of leadership have been flying about for months, particularly about whether communities are getting the supplies they need, and Atleo said the summit should help everybody get on the same page.</p>
<p>"I want to make sure the communication and planning loops are closed," said Atleo.</p>
<p>Later this week he is meeting with the AFN's national executive to discuss H1N1 and whether the communications protocol has been effective so far will be a main topic. He also plans to check in with the federal health minister.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Teachers, trustees and parents join forces against government; Groups unite to oppose Liberal funding cuts that critics say will undermine B.C.'s public school system long-term</b>
</div><div>Janet Steffenhagen   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>594 words</div><div>7 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Organizations representing school trustees, parents, teachers and support workers have joined forces for the first time to press the government to reverse funding decisions that they say threaten B.C.'s public school system.</p>
<p>In a carefully drafted letter, the B.C. School Trustees' Association, the B.C. Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils, the B.C. Teachers' Federation (BCTF) and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) warn Education Minister Margaret MacDiarmid that recent cuts will hurt students.</p>
<p>"We agreed to send this unprecedented letter outlining our shared concern about the cutbacks to programs and grants that are now being felt by students in classrooms across the province," says the letter, a copy of which was provided to The Vancouver Sun late Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Through this letter, parents, school workers, teachers and trustees have come together to ask you to reverse these damaging cuts."</p>
<p>Until now, the unions have stood alone in criticizing the government over education spending, with the trustees' association and the parent organization either supporting the Liberals or remaining silent. The letter is a victory for the BCTF and CUPE because it can't easily be dismissed as union carping.</p>
<p>The groups lament cancellation of the $110-million annual facility grants to school districts, cancellation of a $130,000 grant to B.C. School Sports and reduction of gambling grants to parent advisory councils (PACs) in schools around the province.</p>
<p>As well, the letter complains about the decision to move the CommunityLink program, which provides breakfast programs and other school supports for vulnerable children, out of the Education Ministry and into the Social Development Ministry where it will be funded with gambling grants.</p>
<p>"There is no guarantee that funding for this critically important program will be forthcoming in years to come, resulting in significant impact on our most vulnerable students as well as our aboriginal students," it says.</p>
<p>These funding changes come at a time when trustees are already struggling to balance their budgets due to a small increase in 2009-10 funding that won't cover increased costs for salaries, medical services, gas, hydro, H1N1 prevention measures and the new harmonized sales tax, the letter says.</p>
<p>"As minister of education, you have stated that your intent in these difficult economic times is to protect services for students, especially vulnerable students," it says. But unfunded cost pressures "mean less district funding is available to directly support students."</p>
<p>This year's funding for B.C. public schools is about $4.5 billion.</p>
<p>The letter warns MacDiarmid that funding cuts could result in long-term instability, larger classes and reduced services for students. The decision to chop PAC grants to $10-per-student from $20-per-student will be especially hard on schools in poor neighbourhoods where parents have difficulties fundraising, it says.</p>
<p>For years, PACs have relied on gambling grants to supplement their fundraising, thereby allowing them to purchase computers, library books and playground equipment or pay for field trips and sporting events.</p>
<p>The letter concludes with an appeal to the minister to reverse the cuts "to prevent significant erosion of B.C.'s outstanding public education system."</p>
<p>MacDiarmid did not respond to a request for an interview. This year, B.C. will spend $4.5 billion on public school operations, up $84 million from last year.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 got you down? A quick call to 811 may be all you need; Nurse line ensures waiting rooms won't turn into sick rooms</b>
</div><div>Craig McInnes   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>662 words</div><div>7 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Hold the phone. Dr. Perry Kendall, B.C.'s provincial health officer, says just because you can now call your doctor if you feel like you are coming down with the flu, it doesn't mean you should.</p>
<p>In fact, unless you are pregnant or have underlying health conditions that would put you at greater risk, the first digits you should punch into the phone are 811. That will get you through to the provincial nurse line, where you can get advice on whether your symptoms require any further medical attention or if you should simply go back to bed.</p>
<p>On Monday, the province announced that it has a temporary agreement with doctors that will allow them to charge for dispensing advice over the phone for possible H1N1 patients.</p>
<p>The agreement is a breakthrough for physicians, who have long complained that the provincial health insurance plan doesn't pay for phone consultations, even when they might be more appropriate than a face-to-face visit.</p>
<p>But with a flu epidemic of unknown proportions looming, no one wants doctors' waiting rooms to turn into a good place to get sick.</p>
<p>So it makes a lot of sense to encourage people who think they are contagious to phone first, either to talk to their doctor or to arrange a time for an appointment when they will be least likely to come into contact with others. The same holds true if you don't have a family doctor but make use of a walk-in clinic.</p>
<p>So far, the H1N1 has been a mild flu for most people who get it. It's best managed by staying at home and there is no need to either see a doctor in person or to consult one on the phone, which can now be done at a cost to the provincial health care system of $14.71 a call.</p>
<p>That may not sound like much, but multiply it by what could be thousands of British Columbians falling ill if this flu lives up to its billing and the tab starts to add up.</p>
<p>With a health care system that is already consuming almost half the provincial budget, it's an additional burden we don't need.</p>
<p>Kendall is aware that the phone consultation could be misused.</p>
<p>"We've been trying in the media throughout this to emphasize to physicians and to patients that this isn't just for the worried well who can call their doctor and their doctor can get $14. We've been trying to make it part of a comprehensive, pre-emptive management for people for underlying risk conditions."</p>
<p>Kendall envisions the phone consultations being particularly useful for people who are regularly seeing their doctors, such as pregnant women, who should be discussing the risk of flu and perhaps getting a prescription for Tamiflu in case they come down with H1N1.</p>
<p>If the woman then comes down with flu symptoms, she can phone her doctor and perhaps be told to get the prescription filled without having to go back into the office.</p>
<p>Kendall says there is already an unusual amount of flu for this time of year, which is consistent with the expected second wave of H1N1.</p>
<p>The province has also set up an online symptom checker as a place to start for people concerned they may be coming down with the flu, which you can see at: www.healthlinkbc.ca[http://www.healthlinkbc.ca]</p>
<p>While self-screening services are useful in preserving treatment resources, especially if there's a serious outbreak, people with underlying conditions such as diabetes, severe obesity or other issues that may put them at greater risk of severe illness shouldn't hesitate to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Even then, dialing 811 is a good place to start.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu rewrites social rituals; Youth teams, churches stop handshaking</b>
</div><div>Valerie Berenyi   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>852 words</div><div>7 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>C algary's young soccer players will no longer shake hands with members of the opposite team at the end of every game.</p>
<p>The new policy, kicked off today by the Calgary Minor Soccer Association, is meant to protect players from the spread of the H1N1 flu virus, and is part of a growing trend that has some city organizations rethinking the simple handshake and other rituals surrounding human contact.</p>
<p>"At the end of the game, we're strongly recommending to the coaches that the teams stand in front of each other, cheer or clap appreciation for the other team and then go to their respective dressing rooms," said Daryl Leinweber, the league's executive director.</p>
<p>"And we're recommending that every player and coach washes their hands after that."</p>
<p>A new set of policies governing the indoor soccer season --which runs from October to March--is being distributed today to players, coaches, parents and others in the soccer league that includes more than 12,000 children and youth, ages six to 18. It will be posted in dressing rooms and referees' rooms.</p>
<p>It follows exactly the policies introduced last week by the Edmonton Minor Soccer Association in light of a possible H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>"We're still having that idea of 'congratulations, thank you for a great game,' but we're doing it in a different way," said Leinweber.</p>
<p>As well, players are discouraged from sharing water bottles and parents are asked to keep sick players home. Each team must have hand sanitizer available.</p>
<p>Leinweber anticipates some complaints from parents and coaches, but says those who do "may not realize the severity we're possibly facing. We're being proactive. We don't want to ruin the game, but we want to ensure that the health and welfare of players is being taken care of as best it can.</p>
<p>He hopes the policies are temporary. "In fact, we hope we're over-reacting, that it does not turn out to be a pandemic."</p>
<p>While Hockey Calgary still allows its 14,000 players to shake hands post-game, it's following a set of H1N1 guidelines established by Hockey Canada's chief medical officer. Beyond staying healthy, reporting illness and keeping sick kids home from the rink, the guidelines urge players to carry their own hand sanitizer and, where possible, wash their hands with soap and water after handling hockey equipment.</p>
<p>"Without trying to be facetious, the bacteria that's in hockey equipment on a regularly basis dwarfs H1N1 probability," said president Perry Cavanagh.</p>
<p>Players ages five to 21 are cautioned not to touch their mouths, noses or eyes in the hockey arena, said Cavanagh. Players, coaches and refs alike must drink from their own labelled water bottles. Personal items and towels to soak up sweat and are banned from the bench.</p>
<p>"We're not straying away from handshaking," he said. "We don't believe that in itself is going to be a major transfer mechanism, although the possibility exists."</p>
<p>Handshaking isn't the only ritual being eliminated from public life. This summer, Bishop Derek Hoskin instructed Anglican churches in Calgary stop providing communion by what is called "intinction" -- the practice of worshippers dipping a piece bread or a wafer into a communal chalice filled with red wine.</p>
<p>"The thought is that hands carry more germs than mouths," said Rev. Brian Pearson of St. Stephen's Anglican Church. "But we have not stopped the use of the common cup, although more people are refusing it. That's not officialdom, that's people feeling squeamish, and I don't blame them."</p>
<p>The "passing of the peace" is another tradition falling prey to the threat of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"Prior to communion, everyone turns to one another and with a handshake, a hug or a kiss on the cheek, makes a symbolic sign of peace. Now, people are saying, 'I'm not going to be touching someone else's hand and then going up for communion.' People are getting paranoid," Pearson said.</p>
<p>Some are opting instead to exchange the Hindu practice of "namaste"-- greeting one another with hands in the prayer position and a slight bow.</p>
<p>But bowing, knuckle-bumps and the like haven't taken hold in Calgary's business community, where handshaking continues to be the norm, said Calgary Chamber of Commerce president Heather Douglas. In the past month, Douglas has seen only one person--an individual with a bad cold--not shake hands.</p>
<p>Likewise, Rhona DelFrari, a spokesperson with <span class="companylink">EnCana</span>, said the company has no handshaking policies for its staff of 8,000.</p>
<p>"We do have a lot of other things such as posters, website information, advising people to wash their hands and putting hand sanitizers all over the place--but no direction regarding handshaking. People are free to continue doing that. It's their own choice."</p>

<p>As a doctor, I am astounded at the panic and almost hysteria that I encounter in my office regarding the H1N1 "scare."</p>
<p>I have seen a nine-year-old girl so convinced that she will die if she catches the virus, that she cringes if someone across the street coughs or sneezes.</p>
<p>Every year upwards of 4,000 people die in Canada of seasonal flu.</p>
<p>But with the news of a second wave of H1N1 flu, people now fear that the toll of Canadians will be many times this number.</p>
<p>I believe that the public health authorities at the national, provincial and municipal levels have failed to communicate to the public the real situation.</p>
<p>These public health officials must allay these totally unrealistic fears that people of all ages are experiencing.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>The area public health board is seeking to clear up the confusion surrounding seasonal and H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph public health is planning a series of free public information nights in Guelph, Wellington County and Dufferin County.</p>
<p>Janice Walters, program manager for control of infectious diseases, said the board hasn't held such flu information nights in previous years, but there's a lot of confusion about the various influenza strains in circulation and vaccines and treatments for them. That includes not just individuals but organizations.</p>
<p>"We have a lot of callers that want someone to come to speak to their groups," she said.</p>
<p>The health board is set to offer vaccinations against seasonal and the, potentially more harmful, H1N1 strains shortly.</p>
<p>The board will be tailoring clinics to quickly reach those most at risk first.</p>
<p>The information nights all begin at 7 p.m. and are about an hour long.</p>
<p>The first is slated for tonight at the Guelph Public Library at 100 Norfolk St.</p>
<p>The remaining ones are at:</p>
<p>Centre Wellington District High School, 905 Scotland St. in Fergus on Oct. 14.</p>
<p>Erin District High School at 14 Boland Dr. in Erin on Oct. 14</p>

<p>The Stock</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Transat A.T. Inc</span>.</p>
<p>Recent price</p>
<p>$16.53</p>
<p>Trend</p>
<p>In times of economic uncertainty discretionary spending takes a hit. However, judging by the third-quarter performance of stocks in leisure industries, many people are less concerned about losing their jobs than finding a place to spend their hard-earned cash.</p>
<p>Economists talk about an increasing savings rate, but the market seems to see a revival in leisure spending.</p>
<p>The list of bullish stocks in the group rings a happy tune: recreational vehicle manufacturers <span class="companylink">Winnebago Industries</span>, <span class="companylink">Thor Industries</span>, and <span class="companylink">Polaris Industries</span> are in motion. <span class="companylink">Callaway Golf</span> and <span class="companylink">Brunswick Corp</span>. are scoring again. The market tells of consumers making vacation plans, too.</p>
<p>Along with a revived airline sector, many hotel, resort and cruise line stocks have handily outperformed the broad market over the past three months. The share price trends of <span class="companylink">Royal Caribbean Cruises</span> and <span class="companylink">Carnival Corp</span>. suggest that employed workers would rather be poolside on the deck of a cruise ship than at home worrying about losing their jobs.</p>
<p>The Trade</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Transat A.T. Inc</span>. is a big player in many Canadians' holiday plans. The tour operator has had its share of ups and downs with the rest of the tourism industry. Its stock dived from a high of $42.38 two years ago to bottom at $6.51 at the bear market low in March.</p>
<p>A financial crisis, economic recession, and swine flu epidemic scare made it a frightening ride for shareholders. But seasons change, and Transat has joined in with the renewed optimism that is lifting stocks in the travel business. Stock Trends Bullish since mid-June, Transat is a rehabilitated stock – even raising $55.25-million in a recent equity issue.</p>
<p>Trading volume in the stock was high last week, more than four times its weekly average, as the stock advanced 26 per cent and hit a new 52-week high. The stock's move was launched off the 13-week moving average trend line, a technical signal that the bullish trend will advance the stock further.</p>
<p>Investors encouraged by revived consumer confidence can buy into this trend and book a flight with the shares of Transat.</p>
<p>The Upside</p>
<p>Clearing price resistance at $15.50 last week gives the stock some clear sky above, possibly another 20- to 30-per-cent move when the share price cracks the next resistance level above $18. Look for trading to remain active as the market gains confidence in the stock. Technical analysts like to see strong trading volume fuelling rallies.</p>
<p>Increased retail trading in Transat helps too, so last week's trading is a positive sign – weekly transactions were the highest since the stock's 2007 peak. The share price is up 58 per cent since mid-summer, but is not likely finished with its bullish move.</p>
<p>The Downside</p>
<p>Turning this story upside down would be the same factors that cripple the tourism industry – economic contraction or another health crisis. The former seems unlikely in the near term; the latter seems always a sneeze away. Investors entering this trade can use the prevailing trend line as a guide for exiting the stock if things go ill.</p>
<p>The Stock Trends Weak Bullish indicator generally signals when a stock has broken below trend line support – a signal that flashes if Transat drops below $12.50.</p>

<p>cb says:</p>
<p>Personally, I find criminal activity and those who participate in it to be "cruel and unusual." So when do I get my hearing?</p>
<p>Richard says:</p>
<p>I don't like his ilk any more than the rest of you. But he is not guilty until proven so in a court of law, and that is the law. Anything else takes "the system" down to his level, and it's already low enough.</p>
<p>Bacon Eater says:</p>
<p>The fact he is using up the court's time over his accommodations is disgusting. Jamie, my taxpayer dollars are feeding and housing you. You are lucky you are getting any food or shelter. Get used to your surroundings; it is going to be your home for a very long time!</p>
<p>Doug says:</p>
<p>I'm not under any illusions about the Bacon brothers' criminal past but cruel and unusual punishment is not the Canadian way. Psychological torture by isolation and incarceration in an unsanitary environment is not justice unless you're as bloodthirsty as they are. If and when he is found guilty he should receive an appropriate sentence (no double time for time served awaiting trial) and serve it for the full term -- but not at the Hanoi Hilton.</p>
<p>Garbage Bear says:</p>
<p>Just put him in general population. I am sure he will be well received there.</p>

<p>Doctors to be paid for H1N1 diagnoses by phone.</p>
<p>BACKCHAT</p>
<p>cash taps opened says:</p>
<p>And you wonder why the costs of health care keep rising. These guys first fear-mongered the public with H1N1, creating the customer base, and now they will provide the health services for a fee. What a snake-oil act!</p>
<p>peter pickle says:</p>
<p>This is all well and good, but the "after hours" visits have me wondering. My last doctor was burned out from more than 80 hours a week. He was under 50 years old. My present doctor, about 45, is getting dreadfully close. He works two clinics, does his hospital visits, and shares ER duties with his colleagues in a medium-sized community.</p>

<p>When is the last time you were able to just call up your doctor and talk on the phone?</p>

<p>No road through Surrey's Bear Creek Park, city council decides.</p>
<p>BACKCHAT</p>
<p>nightshifter says:</p>
<p>Good on the council for having the intestinal fortitude to actually listen and obey the constituents. "City of parks" is still standing.</p>
<p>dj says:</p>
<p>We cannot keep building more houses in Surrey and expect there not to be a need for more roads. 88th Avenue is under way too much pressure, and has been for years already. Building the extension on 84th is the solution. It's not about the park. Roads have been built all over this province without killing the wilderness. It's about the homes on 84th. The owners (who have some pull) are more worried about their property values than anything else. Council needs to poll all the people sitting on 88th every day.</p>
<p>Take the bus says:</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks a roadway won't interfere with the ecology of the area should probably go to school.</p>
<p>Not a NIMBY says:</p>
<p>I no longer live in Surrey but used to, and spent a lot of time in Bear Creek Park with my kids. I still go to the park when we are in Surrey. It is a beautiful park and needs to be retained. I drive through the Stanley Park causeway every day and I see why it wasn't increased in size.</p>
<p>Big Al Jones says:</p>
<p>City council: Put an underpass through there instead. It will preserve the parkland above and provide the needed roadway.</p>

<p>BACKCHAT</p>
<p>Dunc says:</p>
<p>Jim Green wants to charge owners of decrepit buildings higher taxes, then prevent them from charging market rents. Only someone who has lived off taxpayers' money would come up with such stupid ideas.</p>
<p>Maybe he didn't notice that the Soviet Union collapsed or that China's economy has boomed since it embraced capitalism.</p>
<p>Joe the Plumber says:</p>
<p>After the ribbon cutting, the photo ops and the smoke and mirrors has dissipated from the Woodward's Taj Mahal it will be business as usual in the Downtown Eastside. There have been other new condos and businesses that have sprung up in the area over the years and the residents still have to step over the drunks and step around the needles and human waste piles.</p>
<p>Jeff Taylor says:</p>
<p>News flash to the residents of the PNE area: "They are coming!" Many of the drug addicts, thieves and the "hard core" will soon enough be on the move -- eastward.</p>
<p>lord roberts says:</p>
<p>The Woodward's I remember as a child was the social, economic and cultural cornerstone of Vancouver. Coming from a grateful immigrant family that appreciated being adopted by this country, my fondest memory as a child was the Christmas-themed storefront . . .</p>
<p>[But] the new building bears no resemblance to the location's former significance. I have one question: How and why has this iconic location become ground zero for all of Canada's social ills?</p>

<p>What is happening to the health-care system in Saskatchewan?</p>
<p>Hallway hospital beds. Are we living in a Third World country? I do not know who came up with this idea but they should have been fired. This is absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p>There is no privacy in a hallway, there are no patient facilities in a hallway, and that is not the reason hallways were constructed. I have been fortunate not to have had the experience of being a hallway patient, and am sure that no MLA, city councillor or health board official has ever suffered the indignity and embarrassment of lying on a stretcher in a hospital hallway. However, those who have say it is a nightmare they do not wish to repeat.</p>
<p>What is going to happen when H1N1 hits us? Are they going to set up tents in the hospital parking lots, complete with portable toilets and coal oil lamps?</p>
<p>Shame on those in power for making such an insane decision. Shame on us, as Saskatchewan taxpayers, for allowing this to occur.</p>

<p>Family physicians in Toronto are being asked to prepare for the second wave of swine flu by extending office hours and deferring annual checkups.</p>
<p>"The expectation is that primary care providers will modify their practice to increase capacity to see flu patients," states a letter from Dr. Barbara Yaffe, associate medical officer of health for Toronto.</p>
<p>The letter, a copy of which has been obtained by the Star, was sent overnight to Toronto-area primary care providers.</p>
<p>"Influenza activity appears to be increasing in Ontario," Yaffe warns.</p>
<p>Doctors are being urged to see patients with influenza-like illnesses at the end of the day. This is an infection-control measure intended to protect other patients. Doctors are also being asked to postpone non-urgent visits and screen patients for influenza over the phone or as they enter the office.</p>
<p>The letter urges doctors to ensure good infection control by moving patients with flu symptoms into an examination room as soon as possible or by putting surgical masks on them, for example. Doctors should wear masks themselves when seeing patients with flu symptoms.</p>
<p>People suffering from flu symptoms are being urged to stay home, call Telehealth at 1-866-797-0000 or go to their doctor if they are pregnant or if they have an underlying health condition such as diabetes.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>MDs, nurses seek better pandemic plan</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>687 words</div><div>6 October 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>
</p>
<p>Canada's doctors and nurses pressed MPs to help fill the gaps in the national pandemic plan Monday, urging them to ask the government for more consistent communication. They also warned they do not yet feel prepared for a second wave of the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>Representatives from three doctors' and nurses' professional organizations, along with the Canadian Medical Association, appeared before the House of Commons health committee and did not hold back in expressing their concerns.</p>
<p>Linda Silas, president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions, said if the provinces follow the national pandemic plan as it's currently written, nurses in Ontario will be better off than nurses across the country, because of the lessons they learned about infection control from the SARS outbreak a few years ago.</p>
<p>"Ontario has incorporated the precautionary principle on occupational health and safety in its pandemic influenza plan," Silas told MPs.</p>
<p>"We urge you to protect health-care workers and make SARS lessons national lessons. If the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) won't do it, nurses will."</p>
<p>Silas said the national pandemic plan emphasizes health and hygiene among health-care workers -- not health and safety -- and the PHAC needs to show more leadership in protecting health-care workers.</p>
<p>That protection means making N95 respirator masks available to nurses and other frontline workers, despite conflicting evidence about how well they prevent the transmission of influenza.</p>
<p>"We can have a battle of the words and, let me tell you, we've been having it: Researcher X said this, researcher Y said that," said Silas.</p>
<p>"What we all agree on is that the evidence is not clear. What we learned from SARS is that it's too dangerous to wait for conclusive science before deciding on protective measures. Therefore, while scientific debate persists, we have to exercise the precautionary principle: Be safe and not sorry."</p>
<p>As opposed to surgical masks that are cheap and straightforward to use, the N95 masks are custom-fitted and require training to wear them properly. Silas said provinces are telling their health-care workers that if they request a N95 mask, they will get one, but that approach is not good, Silas says. Conducting a risk assessment to determine if a health-care worker qualifies for such protection also involves going through a four-page set of guidelines, which is inefficient, she said.</p>
<p>The president of the Canadian Medical Association told the committee her organization is still worried about a persistent "communications gap" between public health officials and frontline health-care workers.</p>
<p>"Physicians must be involved in the planning stages and must receive consistent, timely and practical, plain-language information. They should not have to seek information out from various websites or other sources, or through the media," said Dr. Anne Doig.</p>
<p>Canada's doctors are also concerned about having adequate resources -- human resources and physical equipment such as respirators -- during the pandemic, which is expected to worsen in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Doig, a Saskatoon doctor, noted how every province is following its own strategy for administering the seasonal flu vaccine and the H1N1 vaccine, and urged the federal government to issue some guidance.</p>
<p>"We need a clear statement of recommendation to clear up this variability," she said.</p>
<p>Doig said the CMA is working with the Public Health Agency of Canada to develop one-page documents that doctors can easily reference for guidance on how to handle the pandemic. The College of Family Physicians is also involved in that work.</p>
<p>"We're seeing some action," said the group's associate executive director, John Maxted. "We're hoping that it's not too little, too late."</p>
<p>Across the country, doctors are getting a mix of too much information and not enough of it, he said, and there are still many unanswered questions, particularly about the H1N1 vaccine. Family doctors, who are often the first to see patients who fall ill, need concise "how-to" information, he said. Maxted also noted family doctors should have access to infection-control measures such as the N95 masks.</p>

<p><span class="companylink">Conexus Credit Union</span> is banking on its pandemic preparations to keep employees and customers healthy.</p>
<p>"Conexus does take the H1N1 pandemic very seriously," said Ian Rea, CEO of <span class="companylink">Conexus Credit Union</span>.</p>
<p>He said the company's first priority is to ensure the health and safety of employees and members by reducing illness at the workplace.</p>
<p>"Secondly, we'll be looking to avoid disruption of service to our members and customers," Rea said.</p>
<p>Since June, the company's pandemic planning committee has met regularly to review human resource policies, technology, communications and facilities.</p>
<p>"We have initiated an intranet website to share information and updates with staff on a regular basis," Rea said. "That's everything from the symptoms, prevention -- things like handwashing -- updates from the committee and updates that we get from daily monitoring of the issue."</p>
<p>To prevent the spread of the virus, employees with H1N1 symptoms are asked to stay at home. The company has purchased personal pandemic preparedness kits for each employee.</p>
<p>"Those came from the Saskatchewan Abilities (Council), which is one of our charities of choice," Rea said.</p>
<p>Beginning next week, the kits will be sent to each Conexus employee and bulk supplies will soon be on their way to each facility in the province. Conexus has a Saskatoon location on Circle Drive.</p>
<p>"We've had the hand sanitizer and additional cleaning supplies available, but as part of this process, we will be moving that out to our facilities in bulk so they don't have to order it or go looking for it," Rea said. "That recent addition to our program will ensure availability throughout the flu season."</p>
<p>Conexus has received the new guide called Pandemic Planning: Best Practice Guideline for Occupational Health and Safety, which the provincial government is mailing to workplaces around the province.</p>
<p>Glennis Bihun, executive director of Occupational Health and Safety, expects all copies of the workplace guide will be mailed today.</p>
<p>"This is the first time that we've provided a guideline that specifically relates job tasks to ways to control exposure to pandemic influenza," she said.</p>
<p>The guide helps identify what tasks are required to do a job, what exposure risks are related to that job and what controls need to be in place.</p>
<p>Hard copies of the guide can be requested from Occupational Health and Safety. The guide is also available online at www.labour.gov.sk.ca[http://www.labour.gov.sk.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca] h1n1-influenza-ohs.</p>

<p>When the first wave of H1N1 hit, a Regina business owner said demand for hand sanitizers and specialized respirator masks hit like a "tidal wave."</p>
<p>"Within days, everybody was cleaned out -- it didn't matter who you called," said Garth Chatterson, owner of Chatterson Janitorial Supplies. "Suppliers basically said, 'You should stock up because (the second wave) will be bigger than the first wave.' "</p>
<p>Chatterson's business was among those that had a long wait before suppliers could fill back orders.</p>
<p>"As soon as the scare is on, the phone just rings and every second call is about hand sanitizer," he said. "It stresses the supply line, definitely. . . . It depends on which supply lines you have as to how soon you'll run out."</p>
<p>Now he has a healthy supply of hand sanitizers and masks on hand for businesses and individuals to purchase from his Regina store.</p>
<p>But getting N95 masks -- which provide greater respiratory protection than surgical masks -- remains a problem at Jolly's Veterinary & Surgical Supplies, also located in Regina.</p>
<p>"A lot of people panicked and stocked up," said co-owner Oralea Behnke. "We have a few different suppliers and we've been waiting two months for masks. They're having trouble keeping them in stock."</p>
<p>Although suppliers are reluctant to give an exact shipping date, Behnke expects to have masks on the shelves by mid-month. Hand sanitizing gels were on back order for two months, but are now available at Jolly's.</p>
<p>"We have some in gallons that people have been buying because that will go a lot farther, but we don't have cases and cases of it," Behnke said.</p>
<p>Chatterson, who has been in the family business since 1973, believes the media has overblown concerns about the pandemic.</p>
<p>"This is no different than preparing for the flu season," he said. "If it gets hyped up, we'll probably get cleaned out too. . . . What has been good about (the heightened awareness) is that it has been teaching people to sneeze into their arms and wash their hands often. The hand sanitizers are a good in-between step."</p>
<p>He advises people to dry their hands with paper towels rather than use blow dryers. He also recommends using the paper towel to open the door to avoid re-contamination.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>‘Invisible' sodium think tank under fire</b>
</div><div>CARLY WEEKS </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Canada's sodium-reduction task force has failed to fulfill its mandate on an urgent public-health issue and has such a low profile it's “invisible” to the public and policy-makers, members of the House of Commons health committee said yesterday.“This is an urgent issue and what is taking so long?” asked NDP health critic Judy Wasylycia-Leis.</p>
<p>The MPs join a growing chorus of medical experts and health advocates who have been demanding immediate action from the government and industry to lower the levels of sodium throughout Canada's food supply.</p>
<p>The federal government appointed the task force in 2007 to develop a strategy to lower the population's salt intake. The sodium working group consists of medical professionals, policy-makers, food-industry representatives and consumer advocates.</p>
<p>The problem is that many food makers add so much sodium to their products that, on average, Canadians consume about 3,100 milligrams of sodium daily – double the recommended level for adults.</p>
<p>Medical experts say a national sodium-reduction strategy is needed because a majority of the salt we eat – about 80 per cent – is added to packaged or processed foods such as bread, sauces and soups.</p>
<p>The committee briefly diverted its attention from the discussion of an H1N1 flu strategy to discuss sodium yesterday. It was the first time the parliamentary committee dedicated a meeting to the discussion of Canada's excessive sodium consumption, and many MPs expressed frustration and disappointment that the national working group hasn't produced any tangible results more than two years after its formation.</p>
<p>“I have some concerns,” said Liberal health critic Carolyn Bennett. “I want to know what's been happening over the last 2½ years and how do we get going?”</p>
<p>Members of the task force said they're doing their best, but that without a significant investment from the federal government, their efforts will never be successful.</p>
<p>A massive sodium-reduction campaign rolled out several years ago in Britain cost the government more than $30-million, said Mary L'Abbé, vice-chair of the sodium working group.</p>
<p>The sodium working group met last week for the first time in several months and outlined its recent progress. Dr. L'Abbé said it is working with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to develop a plan for future research on sodium. While MPs were critical of the task force's progress, their involvement is crucial to the future of the cause because they can help push the federal government to invest in sodium reduction, said Norm Campbell, Canadian chair in hypertension prevention and control and a member of the sodium task force.</p>
<p>“I think the politicians should hold our committee to task,” Dr. Campbell said.</p>
<p>“Perhaps this should have been on their agenda many years ago.”</p>

<p>Health-care workers in a Memphis, Tenn., hospital are among the first in the U.S. to receive the swine flu vaccine, which is currently only available in the U.S. in nasal spray form.</p>
<p>Canada is only scheduled to begin vaccinating in early to mid November, though Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones has said he could ask Health Canada to release the vaccine a few weeks earlier under special licensing provisions if the risk from the virus seemed to increase.</p>

</p>
<p>Five cases of H1N1 influenza A have been confirmed at Columbia International College.</p>
<p>Principal Ron Rambarran said testing by Hamilton's public health department and a Toronto lab confirmed the presence of the virus in five swabs taken last week.</p>
<p>Rambarran said about 96 of the school's nearly 1,200 students are being monitored for various symptoms, all of which are mild -- such as a minor cough or tickle in their throats.</p>
<p>"They have a variety of symptoms," he said. "It's not necessarily fevers. We're being extremely vigilant."</p>
<p>There were 158 students being monitored last week, when about 57 students became ill.</p>
<p>"Last week between Wednesday and Friday we were adding approximately 20 names of students to the list (per day)," he said. "The positive news today is we've just added eight to the list. The positive news is it seems to be resolving itself."</p>
<p>The school took 62 names off the list yesterday.</p>
<p>Rambarran said the students being monitored at the private university preparatory school are being asked to stay in their rooms and are having food brought to them.</p>
<p>A handful have taken to wearing surgical masks as a precaution.</p>
<p>Rambarran acknowledged the school is sensitive to the concerns of the students, who come from 60 countries around the world. He knows parents living oceans away need reassurance that their children are safe.</p>
<p>"We keep them informed by our websites, our e-mails or overseas offices. By and large our parents are quite content that we are doing everything possible to make sure their children are safe and secure."</p>
<p>Columbia students Tonye Anganwu of Nigeria and Victoria Armyaninova of Russia, both 17, have reassured their parents.</p>
<p>"The school is doing a lot to prevent H1N1," Armyaninova said. "I told my parents the school is prepared."</p>
<p>She added she believes media hype about the flu is overblown.</p>
<p>Anganwu agrees.</p>
<p>"I think this school has more hand sanitizers than all the Tim Hortons in Canada," he said.</p>
<p>"That's why we're not scared," Armyaninova adds, "because we see the school is paying attention to this."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Shelters get 485 extra beds; Province commits $2.5M to homeless</b>
</div><div>Colette Derworiz   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>753 words</div><div>6 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>T he Alberta government has set aside $2.56 million for up to 485 extra mats at Calgary's emergency shelters this winter to deal with a surge in the homeless population -- although some worry a potential H1N1 outbreak could derail those plans.</p>
<p>Yvonne Fritz, minister of housing and urban affairs, said it's important there are enough beds for the city's growing homeless population.</p>
<p>"This is a real priority for us . . . to protect the most vulnerable people," she said Monday in an interview.</p>
<p>"I consider the homeless the most vulnerable. They really need our help, especially in the winter."</p>
<p>Following several meetings with shelter operators, the province determined it will fund 485 extra mats this winter, for a total of 2,600 emergency beds. Last winter, they funded 370 additional beds.</p>
<p>There are also hundreds of transitional beds for the homeless in emergency and other shelters.</p>
<p>The Calgary Homeless Foundation estimates the number of homeless in the city has grown this year to 4,580, a 13 per cent increase over an official civic count in 2008.</p>
<p>Shelters have been noticing an increase in their numbers due to the recession and experienced another spike during the weekend's blast of cold weather.</p>
<p>"As the nights get colder, those who have been sleeping rough are going to come in," said Karen Livick, chief operating officer of the Salvation Army community services.</p>
<p>As many as 500 homeless people sleep rough, meaning they stay outside on most nights. They only use shelters during significant temperature drops.</p>
<p>Fritz said the first wave of 293 extra beds being funded by the province will open by November at existing homeless shelters:</p>
<p>-120 at the Calgary Drop-In Centre, which will also receive $225,000 for renovations to accommodate the extra people;</p>
<p>-80 at the Salvation Army's Booth Centre;</p>
<p>-53 at the Centre of Hope; and</p>
<p>-40 at Alpha House</p>
<p>Another 192 beds will be added as needed during the winter at the following facilities:</p>
<p>-40 at Inn From the Cold;</p>
<p>-80 at the Mustard Seed Foothills Shelter;</p>
<p>-30 at the Booth Centre; and</p>
<p>-42 at the Wagner Centre</p>
<p>Shelter operators are hopeful this year's winter response plan will address the growing need.</p>
<p>"That's great," said Diana Schwenk, director of development with the Mustard Seed. "We're looking into what we need to do to ensure that everyone is off the streets in the winter."</p>
<p>Although the president of the Calgary Homeless Foundation is also optimistic about the plan, he worries that a flu outbreak could cause problems.</p>
<p>"A pandemic throws a wrinkle into things," said Tim Richter. "What happens if you have a whole bunch of people . . . and you have an outbreak in a large facility so you have to move people and isolate, so we have to move people and isolate them where?</p>
<p>"All of our winter space is in existing space so that could be a bit of a challenge."</p>
<p>Debbie Newman, assistant executive director with the Calgary Drop-In Centre, said they have plans to isolate clients with the flu in a multipurpose room on the sixth floor.</p>
<p>"We've been working on our own plan for a while," she said, noting there are still some questions for the province.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services, which met with shelter officials on Monday, said it will work with the agencies to deal with outstanding concerns surrounding the homeless.</p>
<p>"They are a high-risk group and we are encouraging these individuals to be immunized as soon as possible," said spokesman Don Stewart, noting the H1N1 vaccine is expected to be available by mid-November.</p>
<p>Richter said he's pleased with the response by the province, which also committed to funding and other supports for shelters.</p>
<p>"The challenge now is, will it happen in time?" he said. "We're further ahead today than we were yesterday, but we can't underestimate the logistical challenge we have ahead and a limited amount of time.</p>
<p>"Flu season is here . . . will we beat a major outbreak?"</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ex-Mexican president denounces visa ruling; 'You don't do that to your neighbours'</b>
</div><div>Suzanne Wilton   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>486 words</div><div>6 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Canada is making a "big mistake" by not backing down on its visa requirements for Mexican nationals, says that country's former president.</p>
<p>Speaking at the University of Calgary Monday, Vicente Fox urged the Canadian government to find a "better solution" to its refugee problems, if that indeed is the reason for its recent change in policy in requiring Mexicans to obtain a visa to come here.</p>
<p>"It's a big mistake," said Fox, Mexico's president from 2000 to 2006. "You don't do that to your neighbours, you're partners," he added, pointing to the NAFTA agreement.</p>
<p>Canada sparked a so-called visa war in July, when Canadian Immigration Minister Jason Kenney announced the new visa requirement for Mexicans, as well as residents of the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Critics and experts said the policy chance could hurt trade relations with the European Union, because of the Czech Republic's membership, and with Mexico, a NAFTA partner. Mexico soon retaliated, saying it would require diplomats to have a visa to enter Mexico; the Czech Republic recalled its ambassador in protest.</p>
<p>Seeking to smooth relations with Mexico at a high-profile summit in August, Prime Minister Stephen Harper blamed Canada's refugee system for a decision to impose visas on Mexican nationals, and urged Parliament to enact changes to stave off "bogus" claims.</p>
<p>But he showed no indication Canada would rescind the policy.</p>
<p>Mexico is the No. 1 source of refugee claims to Canada, with the number nearly tripling to 9,400 since 2005, according to the Immigration Department.</p>
<p>If Canada's refugee system is to blame, then the country ought to fix the problem instead of imposing penalties on the entire Mexican nation, said Fox, adding many Mexicans work in the U. S. and in Canada in the construction and service industries.</p>
<p>"I don't know how much this great nation realizes what it's losing by requiring that visa," said Fox, who addressed the issue during a question-and-answer session following a talk on leadership.</p>
<p>Fox was also critical of the U. S. and its protectionist efforts in the wake of the economic crisis. He said the three countries should be strengthening their ties through the NAFTA agreement, rather than "building walls."</p>
<p>"We should be building bridges," he said.</p>
<p>"I'm not for open borders all the way," he added. "Every nation has the right to control its borders. But this nation (Canada) is a nation of (im)migrants."</p>
<p>As a side note, Fox promoted Mexican tourism, which has sagged due to the H1N1 health crisis.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>MDs will get paid for giving phone advice to possible H1N1 patients; The new temporary policies emerge from talks between the B.C. government and the BCMA</b>
</div><div>Jonathan Fowlie   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>384 words</div><div>6 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Doctors in British Columbia will now receive payment for giving telephone advice to patients suspected of having H1N1, the government announced Monday.</p>
<p>"Providing the option of telephone advice for H1N1 patients is a sensible alternative to having symptomatic patients visiting a doctor's office," provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall said in a written statement.</p>
<p>The government also announced Monday it will remove limits on the number of patients doctors can be paid to see per day if the virus spreads too quickly to be addressed under current limits.</p>
<p>"Increased access to health professionals will help ensure that public health and safety remains a priority and patients get the most appropriate care quickly," Healthy Living and Sport Minister Ida Chong said in a written statement.</p>
<p>The new temporary policies emerge from discussions between government and the B.C. Medical Association, and are meant to address an expected resurgence of the H1N1 virus in B.C.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to work with the BCMA in establishing new fee codes as one step in ensuring that physicians across the province have appropriate support to manage this year's flu season," Health Services Minister Kevin Falcon said in a statement.</p>
<p>"If you're sick with the flu, quite frankly the last thing you want to do is pack yourself up and head for the doctor's office. In this instance, telephone advice makes perfect sense," BCMA president Dr. Brian Brodie said in a statement.</p>
<p>"If the doctor feels you should come in, then the visit can be arranged for a convenient time and coordinated to limit spreading the virus to other patients."</p>
<p>The new rules mean doctors will be paid $14.74 to provide telephone advice to patients who have symptoms of H1N1.</p>
<p>Doctors will also receive $31.15 for each H1N1 patient they see in their office. At present, there is a cap of a daily maximum of about 50 patients a day for office visits. If needed, the cap will be lifted for doctors seeing patients with H1N1.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mild outbreak of H1N1 virus in B.C. could overwhelm system: report</b>
</div><div>Kelly Sinoski   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>783 words</div><div>6 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Even a mild outbreak of the H1N1 flu virus has the potential to overwhelm parts of B.C.'s health care system, particularly its critical care resources, according to a draft report commissioned by the province.</p>
<p>The confidential Report on Hospital Critical Care Ventilator Capacity, prepared by Global Consulting for the Ministry of Health Services, suggests B.C.'s "limited" critical care resources aren't sufficient to handle an increase in H1N1 patients this fall.</p>
<p>Most of B.C.'s ventilators are already being used for other cases, the report states, leaving the province with only 127 machines to cope with the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>The virus, which has resulted in 53 severe cases in B.C. since April, is expected to see further outbreaks over the next two months. Six people have already died.</p>
<p>"If the course of H1N1 within B.C. mirrors that seen in the Southern Hemisphere, B.C. must expect an increase in ICU admissions as the second wave of H1N1 returns to B.C. this fall," the report said.</p>
<p>"Given the current usage of critical care resources, the impact of even a mild presentation of the H1N1 virus on British Columbia may create a surge that could challenge the ability of critical care units to meet the demand and care for patients."</p>
<p>Despite the warnings, both B.C.'s chief medical officer and the Ministry of Health Services are downplaying the findings, saying they believe B.C. is adequately equipped to deal with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Michelle Stewart, a spokeswoman for the health ministry, said ministry officials don't believe a mild outbreak would cripple the critical care system.</p>
<p>The ministry complained that the report, which was commissioned to determine B.C.'s ventilator capacity, was modeled on the 1968 flu pandemic and not the 2009 H1N1 outbreaks in Australia and New Zealand. It has sent the report back for more information.</p>
<p>Most of the cases in B.C. have so far been mild and have not required hospitalization.</p>
<p>"We have revised the calculations based on the advice received by health professionals ... after the experience of the Southern Hemisphere during their recent influenza season," health ministry spokesman Ryan Jabs said in an e-mail.</p>
<p>"If these predictions bear out, then we are confident we can manage through the anticipated H1N1 season without major disruption to our acute care system."</p>
<p>He added the health ministry has ordered another 25 ventilators and has a stockpile of anti-viral medications to treat one million people as well as supplies such as masks, gowns and gloves.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall, B.C.'s chief medical officer, said Monday he hadn't seen the report, but based on the outbreaks in the Southern Hemisphere, B.C. should be able to manage the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>While there's been an increase in the spread of the virus since school started and the numbers are expected to continue climbing until November, he said, there hasn't been an increase in hospital admissions.</p>
<p>Most people, he added, will be able to fight H1N1 as they would the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>"The anticipation is that we can probably manage that," Kendall said. "It's anticipated that at some point there will be pressure on critical care and ventilators, but we're not there yet."</p>
<p>The province has 976 ventilators including some in pediatric units.</p>
<p>Kendall said he expects B.C. will manage the outbreak by encouraging people who are at high risk of becoming severely ill -- such as pregnant women and those with chronic illnesses -- to get prescriptions for anti-viral drugs from their doctors.</p>
<p>This way, he said, they will be prepared if they develop H1N1 symptoms such as fever, muscle aches and pains, a cough and sore eyes.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has declared the overall severity of the pandemic to be "moderate," which means most people recover from infection without the need for hospitalization or medical care.</p>
<p>Between 400 to 800 people die in B.C. from the seasonal flu or pneumonia each year.</p>

<p>Re-think solutions</p>
<p>The judge made the right legal decision in the Kapyong case. However, we continue to allow antiquated agreements with Canada's First Nations to stymie our county's forward progress. This hurts all Canadian citizens, First Nations or otherwise. The urgency of our First Nation's social problems can no longer be ignored. Canadians must take a stand and argue that we will not tolerate agreements that keep a segment of our population mired in poverty and squalor. Free flowing reparations are not the answer.</p>

<p>Cam Chabot accuses the Free Press of printing misleading material (Hot on climate change, Oct. 2). He cannot substantiate a single detail. He states that "summer ice may be holding steady." In fact, summer ice has increased 25 per cent since 2007. He and NASA use 1979 as a starting point. Sorry, but I was in the Arctic before then. Satellite measurements started in 1979, which was a high point in the ice cycle. In 1957, Popular Mechanics quoted a leading scientist, Dr. Sverre Peterssen, as saying "already the North Pole ice has decreased 40 per cent in volume." So the cycles are nothing new. Cam accuses "non-believers" of cherry-picking. With the lack of facts, Cam has resorted to attacking the messenger, an all too common occurrence.</p>

<p>I am flabbergasted that the Winnipeg Free Press continues to publish stories about too many body bags being sent to northern reserves in preparation for H1N1. I think I speak for a large majority of people when I say let it go already. I think that the people of these reserves are reading way too much into what may very well have been a shipping order mistake. With all the improvement that needs to occur in the northern reserves (like securing proper running water) this is what they choose to focus their efforts on?</p>

Interestingly she invokes the "laws of physics," holding on pure faith the singular existence of a "law" with no law giver. She insists that atheists don't think people of faith are stupid or insane, but goes on to describe our position as accepting a radical dogma based on no evidence -- by definition stupid or insane.</p>
<p>As to her music, I'm sure it is very beautiful. However, I use my phrase "tone deaf" metaphorically.</p>

<p>Learning all day</p>
<p>Re: The costs of "full-day learning" (Sept. 30). I am writing in response to Rebecca Walberg's commentary on full-day learning, as I feel it misrepresents the benefits of child care in several areas. The High Scope/Perry Preschool Study conducted in the States was a longitudinal study of the effects on high-quality preschool that spanned over 40 years. It has shown the overwhelmingly positive effect on many aspects of these children's (now 40-year-olds) lives. Numerous other studies have had similar findings.</p>
<p>Walberg also states that Quebec's $7-per-day child care program has not produced the higher revenues they anticipated. What she doesn't mention is that the poverty rate in Quebec has dropped 40 per cent over the last decade, and families with single mothers have seen a 30 per cent increase in wages. Accessible, full-time day care has been one of the driving forces in changing these statistics.</p>
<p>For more evidence of the economic gains to be had as a result of extended, high quality day care, look to recent reports such as UNICEF's The Childcare Transition, or Lynn Karoly's study on the economics of preschools in California. Overall, the studies are adding up in overwhelming favor of the benefits of quality child care. We can't afford to get left behind.</p>

It's just another fee that does not prevent anything; criminals do not register their guns! I think the gun registry should be dumped and the money that is saved should go towards security measures, which could help prevent these crimes. As a hunter it would be a bonus not to have to pay the annual fee.</p>

<p>Polygamy reality</p>
<p>Re: No business in polygamists' bedrooms (Sept. 26). The fundamental problem with the polygamist community in Bountiful British Columbia is not the polygamy itself; it is the oppression of the young girls who are the victims of these polygamous unions. What is the fate of the adolescent girls of Bountiful? To marry a man old enough to be her grandfather and to bear a dozen or so of his children. These young girls are brainwashed into believing that the only way into heaven is to be invited by a man from the community. Failure to conform to their community's patriarchal demands will only end in eternal damnation. Only the boys are allowed to pursue an education; the girls do not normally attend after they are married, which can be as young as 14.</p>
<p>Tom Oleson not only missed the boat on this topic, he seems to be missing the boat entirely. Last time I checked, many, if not most, Canadian families are running off two incomes. Women are supporting themselves and their families. Gone are the days, or should I say "your" days, when a man was the only person bringing home the bacon. If you are going to endeavour to write about current social topics, then please bring yourself up to speed; this is 2009, not 1950.</p>

<p>As they gear up for a swine flu invasion, B.C.'s doctors will be paid to give medical advice over the phone.</p>
<p>The provincial government gave docs the temporary OK yesterday to charge the health-care system a $14.74 fee for telephone consultations to flu patients.</p>
<p>Currently, doctors are not paid for phone consultations.</p>
<p>The doctors also got H1N1 office visits exempted from their patient cap of 50 per day. Doctors will get $31.15 for each H1N1 office visit, with no limits on volume.</p>
<p>It's a sign that doctors and public health officials anticipate a surge in daily flu-patient numbers.</p>
<p>"If you're sick at home with the flu, and you don't know what to do, this provides an option to get some advice by phone," said Dr. Brian Brodie, a Chilliwack family physician who heads the B.C. Medical Association.</p>
<p>"The doctor will ask the same questions, just like an office," he said. "If it sounds like H1N1, an office visit could be arranged for a quieter time, perhaps after-hours in a separate room, to provide containment for the spread of the disease."</p>
<p>Brodie said the fees are nominal to compensate the doctor.</p>
<p>"It's about responsibility," he said. "During a pandemic, there's a lot of people who need advice."</p>
<p>This year's flu outbreak is showing signs of being worse than in prior years. Last week, there were 10 separate outbreaks of flu-like illness in B.C. schools. That's more than in the start of flu season in the previous two years.</p>
<p>"Influenza is circulating in the community right now, including schools," said Vancouver Coastal Health spokeswoman Anna Marie D'Angelo.</p>
<p>"There have been very few hospitalizations, because most people have had illness that resolves itself in a few days."</p>
<p>Provincial Health Officer Perry Kendall said he is not recommending that anyone under age 65 gets a seasonal flu vaccine at this time.</p>
<p>Recent studies suggest that taking the seasonal flu vaccine could double the chances of contracting H1N1 in people under 50.</p>
<p>Starting one week today, seasonal flu vaccinations will be available to seniors and residents of long-term-care homes.</p>
<p>And an H1N1 vaccine is expected to be available in November.</p>
<p>Dr. Monica Naus, director of Immunization Programs at of the B.C. Centre for</p>
<p>Disease Control, said the H1N1 vaccine could be available this month for people with high-risk medical conditions, pregnant women, children under five and health-care workers.</p>
<p>The vaccine could also be made available earlier to people in isolated communities.</p>
<p>Since Sept. 22, there has been one new severe case of H1N1.</p>
<p>There have been 53 confirmed cases since April, with six deaths. Of the patients who died, each had an underlying medical condition. jbermingham@theprovince.com</p>

<p>The emergence of the H1N1 virus sparked a firestorm of coverage when it was branded a pandemic by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>After that initial flurry, because the traditional flu season had yet to start, focus shifted away from the effects of swine flu to vaccine production and distribution. But with fall on its way, and with it the return of students to the classroom and holiday-goers to the workplace, there's a renewed emphasis on the unknown: How quickly will this influenza spread, and what impact will it have on those infected and the Canadian health-care system?</p>
<p>Are we ready?</p>
<p>Are you ready?</p>
<p>What are we getting ready for?</p>
<p>The Globe's André Picard did a series of Q&As in the early stages of H1N1. He's an expert on the file, and he's been following it closely from the beginning.</p>
<p>Do you have questions for him related to swine flu? Mr. Picard will peruse them on a regular basis, and answer as many as he can. Keep watching this space for updates.</p>

<p>The fight against flu is going upmarket. An Australian company is touting a high-end hand sanitizer that aims to elevate disinfection from annoyance to extravagance.</p>
<p>Frais - pronounced "fray," as in the French word for fresh - gets its germ-killing properties from sugar-cane alcohol, which is said to be gentler on the skin than varieties contained in drugstore brands. It is also peppered with a proprietary blend of eight essential oils that moisturize the skin while producing an aroma more reminiscent of an eau de cologne than a medical clinic.</p>
<p>Considering its relatively hefty price tag - the company, which is seeking permission to sell Frais in Canadian stores, hawks a 50-millilitre bottle for $7 (U.S.) on its website - Frais appears to be the pioneer in a new consumer category, the luxury anti-flu product.</p>
<p>"We don't want to take advantage of the situation (78 deaths to date in Canada from the H1N1 virus). The product has been there before the swine flu," said Michael Davis-Smith, one of the Sydney-based co-founders of Frais Luxury Products. "But if people enjoy using it and they're protecting themselves from the swine flu, we think, 'Why not?'"</p>
<p>The company, which says global sales of Frais have been on the rise in the months since the World Health Organization declared the H1N1 flu virus a pandemic, counts TV host Kelly Ripa among its early adopters. Along with claiming to kill 99.9 per cent of germs, the product is being billed as eco-friendly (because sugar-cane alcohol can be produced with less energy than its corn-based equivalent), and is not tested on animals. Its creators note that the melange of organic compounds - extracts of grapefruit and cardamom and lemon myrtle, among other exotics - make for a nuanced bouquet that lingers on the skin and appeals to both sexes.</p>
<p>"It's like a bottle of wine ... (The scent) matures over time," said Davis-Smith. Public health officials point out that any hand sanitizer with an alcohol content of 60 per cent or more - Frais is 66 per cent alcohol - can be effective in killing the germs that cause many respiratory illnesses, including H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"If the product has at least 60 per cent alcohol and if it's effective - we're certainly in favour of anything that encourages people to wash or sanitize their hands," said Dr. Sarah Wilson of Toronto Public Health. "But I would certainly not recommend an expensive high-end product over a basic 60 per cent alcohol hand sanitizer. The alcohol is the key in terms of preventing infection ... I'm not aware of any evidence that any essential oils in the product, whether they'd have any additional benefit.</p>
<p>The folks behind Frais are selling more than sanitation.</p>
<p>"I think it's a very clever idea, and the timing is very good," said David Soberman, professor of marketing at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management. "People now are clearly quite worried about flu in general ... The problem is that any of the other companies that are selling these products could easily take this same (high-end) position, which would neutralize what Frais is trying to do. So in the short term, this is a good idea. And one of the things about being a first mover, is if you establish that position in the customer's mind, that's going to be stronger."</p>
<p>Davis-Smith and business partner Robert Main brainstormed the concept of Frais on a 2006 trip to Cambodia, where they found themselves rueing their regular use of run-of-the-mill hand sanitizer that reeked strongly of alcohol.</p>
<p>Said Main: "We ran into all sorts of wonderful aromas and scents in Cambodia. And we couldn't understand why those two things couldn't be combined."</p>
<p>The partners, who had never before launched a retail product, have landed their product on the shelves of luxury retailers in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Recently they've pitched the merits of travel-sized bottle to major airlines. Main said he's done research that indicates 45 per cent of airline passengers use the lavatory to wash their hands before their inflight meal; he theorizes that if those passengers were handed a vial of Frais as an alternative, the airlines could save on fuel costs by hauling less water.</p>

</p>
<p>Rich countries should make more vaccine available to poorer nations where the H1N1 virus is starting to hit, UN health officials said yesterday.</p>
<p>They said increased readiness for swine flu was needed in developing countries with weaker medical systems and with large, young populations, who are most vulnerable to the disease.</p>
<p>"We may well see a different pattern of impact once this virus starts to take off and those explosive outbreaks occur in some of the poorer communities in the world," said Julie Hall, an infections-disease expert at the World Health Organization, a UN agency.</p>
<p>The WHO, which declared H1N1 a global pandemic in June, says a third of the world's population of nearly 7 billion people could catch it.</p>
<p>Some countries, such as the United States, Brazil and France, have agreed to make 10 per cent of their national vaccine stockpile available to developing countries. Manufacturers have also donated about 150 million doses of vaccine.</p>
<p>More is needed, said David Nabarro, the UN coordinator for fighting new emerging flu varieties. "The challenge during the next few weeks is to build up the solidarity between wealthy nations and poor nations to ensure that adequate vaccine is made available."</p>
<p>September and October are usually just the start of flu season in the northern hemisphere, but there are signs of a second H1N1 wave after it first flared this year, Hall said.</p>
<p>"Already we are seeing the U.S., many European countries, Japan and Mexico reporting over the past few weeks a sudden increase in cases," she said.</p>

<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), washing hands is the single most important act to help stop the spread of disease and stay healthy, because 80 per cent of all infections may be transmitted through our hands. But is bar soap or liquid soap most effective when washing hands?</p>
<p>Bottom line, soap and warm water is good and there is no measurable difference between bar soap and liquid soap as far as I'm concerned.</p>
<p>The key is that you want to have the soap on your hands, preferably get up a bit of a lather and create some friction by rubbing your hands together--between fingers and your palms--for at least 20 seconds, or long enough to sing Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. Rinse well.</p>
<p>Carrying your own antibacterial soap or towelettes works as well, but soap and water work better when your hands are visibly dirty --when you have soil or food on them--because alcohol-based sanitizers can't get through all the dirt.</p>
<p>If you're in a place with no soap or water, and your hands look dirty, that's the one place where the towelette has it over the alcohol-based hand sanitizer alone because it can help you physically get the dirt off your hands.</p>
<p>Now if your hands look clean, you might have just shaken hands with someone, for example, the alcohol-based sanitizer, liquid-foam, or towelette are equally good for that, as long as they contain at least a 60-per-cent alcohol concentration.</p>
<p>If your hands are visibly soiled and you aren't anywhere where there's soap and water, you can use a towelette to get the visible dirt off, and then use a second one to clean your hands once the dirt is off.</p>
<p>We're entering into our respiratory season, and it's going to be a little bit of a complex season this year with H1N1 and influenza, so these messages are really good.</p>
<p>The messages are: Wash hands frequently, cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze, and stay home if you get sick.</p>
<p>We're just trying to get people to move in the direction of making it harder for germs to transfer, to do the best that we can.</p>

<p>Re: "Alberta unveils two-part flu plan," Oct. 2.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert says he's concerned Albertans aren't taking the H1N1 situation seriously. And then, "I'm going to get immunized even though I must admit I don't like the thought of the needle." It's disturbing that Liepert would reduce the issue to a silly fear of a needle. I'm a little more worried about things like adjuvant added to the vaccine (for nonpregnant people) and the thimerosal. Hewitson et al (University of Pittsburgh) recently published a study in Neurotoxicology showing significant delays in several survival reflexes after exposure to birth doses of hep B vaccine that included an ethyl mercury preservative (thimerosal). I think he should talk about the real issues and not be so condescending.</p>

</p>
<p>While H1N1 dominates the news these days, another virus is quietly growing at a phenomenal rate to become a "silent epidemic," says a Regina physician.</p>
<p>Dr. Didi Emokpare said rates of hepatitis C have risen 114 per cent among Canadian women between 2006 and 2008, and by 76.6 per cent among men -- and it's believed the numbers could be much greater because the disease is highly underdiagnosed.</p>
<p>"This is a very silent, staggering number," said Emokpare, noting there's been very little attention on the potentially deadly hepatitis C virus (HCV). "It's like it doesn't even exist."</p>
<p>Emokpare is urging more screening for HCV, which can go undetected for decades since it may not lead to illness in its early stages. But detection, through a simple blood test, is important because HCV can be treated and cured, he noted.</p>
<p>"If you don't look for it, you won't find it," Emokpare added. Work is underway to establish hepatitis C clinics in Regina and northern Saskatchewan that will screen, treat and monitor the disease.</p>
<p>Emokpare was speaking in Regina Saturday to those gathered for "The Changing Face of AIDS" conference organized by AIDS Programs South Saskatchewan. Emokpare is executive director of The Lazarus Foundation, a non-profit organization working towards prevention and eradication of HIV/AIDS and its related disease conditions.</p>
<p>Five to 10 years ago, tuberculosis used to be one of the key killers of those infected with HIV; today, they're likely to die of hepatitis C, said Emokpare.</p>
<p>In its later stages, hepatitis C, which is carried in the blood, can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer.</p>
<p>"This is the new thing that's guaranteed to kill you (those who have HIV/AIDS)," said Emokpare, adding about 30 per cent of the people with HIV are also infected with HCV.</p>
<p>There are about 170 million people infected with HCV worldwide. In Canada, about 300,000 people, mostly between the ages of 25 and 45, have HCV, with about 8,000 new infections per year.</p>
<p>The doctor suggested rates of hepatitis C now are where HIV was in the 1980s. "This is a big deal."</p>
<p>In Saskatchewan the number of carriers has hovered around 600 for the last few years, but Emokpare suspects the actual numbers are higher. Currently working part-time at the Regina jail, Emokpare was surprised at how few inmates had ever been tested for HCV, even though jail and prison populations generally have higher rates of infection.</p>
<p>In Canada, the highest risk comes from sharing needles and other "drug-using" equipment, such as straws for inhaling cocaine. But Emokpare noted that since many people have HCV and don't know it, so aren't taking precautions, the disease is being spread outside of drug use. One of the other risks for contracting HCV is through tattooing in unsanitary conditions.</p>
<p>Emokpare said that while rates of acute hepatitis C are 5.5 times higher for aboriginal people, they are also more likely to respond to treatment because of genetics.</p>
<p>While 30 per cent of those with the disease will recover completely without intervention, among those who don't, about 70 to 80 per cent will get a chronic infection.</p>
<p>About 1,000 to 2,000 people die annually in Canada from hepatitis C and the number is expected to triple in the next 10 to 20 years, said Emokpare.</p>

<p>What Ahmadinejad said (2)</p>
<p>Re: the letters by Murray Theunissen and Marty Green (What Ahmadinejad said, Oct. 2). Certainly, there has been much controversy surrounding the translation of the Iranian president's speech. Significantly, the initial translation is said to have originated with IRIB News, an English-language subsidiary of the state-controlled Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, in its story Ahmadinejad: Israel must be wiped off the map (Oct. 26, 2005). According to The New York Times, Ahmadinejad claimed in the speech the issue with Palestine would be over "the day that all refugees return to their homes (and) a democratic government elected by the people comes to power" and condemned all Muslim leaders who accept the existence of Israel as "acknowledging a surrender and defeat of the Islamic world."</p>
<p>Ahmadinejad has made similar speeches. In a public address aired on the Iranian News Channel IRINN TV June 2, 2008, Ahmadinejad is quoted as saying: "The Zionist regime has lost its raison d'être. Today, the Palestinians identify with your name (Khomeini), your memory, and in your path. They are walking in your illuminated path and the Zionist regime has reached a total dead end. Thanks to God, your wish will soon be realized, and this germ of corruption will be wiped off."</p>
<p>The translation Theunissen advances was proposed by Juan Cole, a University of Michigan professor of modern Middle East and South Asian history.</p>
<p>Even if we accept the translation argued by Theunissen, the result is the same. The "regime" in Israel is a Jewish Zionist regime and has been since Israel's creation in 1948. The removal of that regime, whether it be by violence or by the implementation of a so-called "Palestinian right of return," would result in the end of the Jewish state. In the latter case, the Jewish population would be overwhelmed by the Arabs. Israel would become an Islamic state. Most Israelis would leave Israel rather than live under the brutality of Islamic rule. Contrary to Green's assertions, at least 13 Jews have been executed at "home" in Iran since the Islamic Revolution, most of them for either religious reasons or their connection to Israel.</p>
<p>The number of Jews that continue to live in Iran is unknown: some estimates say there are only 11,000. But one thing is clear -- after the Islamic Revolution, tens of thousands left Iran rather than live under the mullahs' repressive regime.</p>

<p>H1N1 confusion</p>
<p>Re: Washing hands frequently might not prevent Influenza (Oct. 2). Most people I talk to are sick and tired of hearing about the flu and H1N1. All you are doing is raising fears: wash/don't wash; is it safe/not safe; do you get the shot if you had the regular one last year/or not. Even the medical experts can't agree on anything. So why don't you stop reporting it until someone actually knows what they are talking about?</p>

<p>Share the burden</p>
<p>What happened to equal time and fair turnaround? Residents in the south end of Winnipeg must wrestle with the weighty issues of infrastructure development and transit enhancement, whilst the residents of North Winnipeg only have to contend with mere trash service re-grade experiments. Mayor Sam Katz, please give our south-end Winnipeggers a break, and transfer the shouldering of this significant burden to other areas of Winnipeg.</p>

<p>Motherhood issue</p>
<p>I was so pleased to read the announcement regarding an expansion for the maternity ward at St. Boniface General Hospital, and was particularly happy to see the number of shared rooms will be decreased, replacing them with private rooms where partners can stay with the birthing mom after delivery. I think this reno will have a big impact on women who have had a high-risk birth.</p>
<p>I am still waiting for the minister to make some announcements around midwifery care in Manitoba and a training program for midwifery in Winnipeg as this, too, is an area of maternal care that is still sorely missing resources, planning and recruitment. Too many women are denied access to midwifery care in Manitoba.</p>

<p>Money on the spot</p>
<p>I'm 15 years old and for most of my life I've been told the best things in life are free. Well, as time's gone by I have noticed the most important things in life aren't free at all. In the last year, I have tried many different ways of making money, including pawning off my things and busking with my guitar, but no matter what I do to earn money it doesn't last longer than a few days. I believe the government should fund a program where anybody could go and make money on the spot from doing simple community service jobs, like cleaning and helping local community centres out with setting up events. I think people should be able to go and do these things whenever they need and get handed a minimum wage at the end of the day. Some may say it's a far-fetched idea, but I want to know what others think because I believe it could make a difference.</p>

<p>Make the link</p>
<p>Recently, federal monies were approved to rebuild and extend Waverley Street to the Perimeter Highway. As much as the decision appears to be politically motivated, an even more urgent need exists to complete the Douglas Road connector, creating a vital link between Henderson Highway and the Transcona area (and relieving congestion on Springfield and Munroe avenues.)</p>
<p>A few months ago, we witnessed a serious traffic accident at the intersection of Regent and Lagimodiere that led to events that paralyzed the East Kildonan, Elmwood and Transcona areas for many hours. It was an alarming wake-up call to city planners, who have dragged their feet on key projects for years. The East Kildonan/Lagimodiere community appears to be the last area of Winnipeg where a fast, efficient corridor (i.e. Sterling Lyon Parkway) does not exist. City hall, it is high time to act, as the Douglas Road connector, or similar roadway, should have been constructed 30 years ago. It is now critically needed.</p>

<p>Winnipeg</p>
<p>Hire local talent</p>
<p>I recently read an article in the Free Press discussing the number of local contractors being used for the construction of the new Canadian Museum for Human Rights. Upon further investigation, I discovered all the major design work for the structural, mechanical and electrical phases had been awarded to three Toronto firms. Considering that Winnipeg has experienced, competent and highly qualified firms capable of doing this work, I cannot understand the selection committee's thinking. The University of Manitoba graduates hundreds of well-educated and highly trained engineers every year. What better way to keep them here than by being hired by Manitoba firms to work on projects of this nature.</p>
<p>Hy Dashevsky</p>
<p>Winnipeg</p>
<p>Teach them early</p>
<p>It seems as though, on a daily basis in the news on both the TV and print, there is constant talk of a gang problem. First, the real problem is not gangs. The real problem is lack of education. In a country where education is free and so readily available, it seems almost incomprehensible for a citizen of Canada under the age of 50 not to have at least a Grade 12 education. Second, having a police constable in high schools is a great way to show the students the police are there to help them and so on. But kids who will join or kids who are in gangs do not go to school to learn; they might go to deal drugs or to recruit but not to learn.</p>
<p>By the time a kid gets to Grade 9 or 10, they have already decided whether they will be in a gang or go to school. We need to have a police presence in elementary and middle schools, first and foremost, to show the potential gang member the police are there to help and that education is the answer, not gangs.</p>

<p>I've washed my hands so often that my fingers are as wrinkled as prunes. Bottles of hand sanitizer are the dominant feature of my home décor. I've learned to open washroom doors and press elevator buttons with my elbow to avoid germy contact, and I've practically dislocated my shoulder to make sure I sneeze in my sleeve.</p>
<p>As someone with an "underlying medical condition," I'm an anxious consumer of flu information, and I'm more than willing to do my part to fight the global pandemic. But as each day passes, I'm more and more confused about what that means.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to agree H1N1 is a crisis, but how big a crisis they don't know. Was the shipment of body bags to isolated native communities a colossally stupid blunder or a worrisome sign of things to come? TV news carries scenes of quarantine dorms at universities, school closings in British Columbia and flu-infested kiddies being treated in tents in front of hospitals. The next newscast brings some medical talking head telling us the pandemic is less serious than predicted.</p>
<p>The advice consists of wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer (done), sneeze or cough into your sleeve (done, but dry cleaning bills mounting due to snotty clothing), disinfect common surfaces (done, all doorknobs shiny) and get the flu vaccine (not done, but not for lack of trying).</p>
<p>There's a federal triage list for the H1N1 vaccine. First on the list are those under 65 with chronic conditions. Next are pregnant women, kids from six months to five years, people who live in isolated communities, and health-care providers. The rest of us are in a big bubble called "those who will benefit from immunization." Those over 65 are at the very bottom.</p>
<p>Ordinary seasonal flu kills 4,000 to 8,000 people in Canada every year, most of them seniors. H1N1 has killed just 78 people so far. So it would make sense, particularly for those over 65, to get a seasonal flu shot. However, there's been a lot of concern about one unpublished study from British Columbia that suggests people who got the seasonal flu shot are more susceptible to H1N1. As a result, some provinces are suspending or delaying the seasonal flu vaccination program.</p>
<p>Ontario's answer is to offer seniors the seasonal flu shot in October, then to vaccinate for H1N1 vaccine on the basis of the triaged list in November, and finally to make the seasonal flu shot available to the rest of us in December and January.</p>
<p>Patients aren't the only ones confused by these schedules. My doctor and her office team just shook their heads when I asked. They're also waiting for information and vaccines. And so far, I'm just talking about prevention. I haven't even begun to look at information on what to do when we get sick.</p>
<p>All this makes me wonder if the experts trying to keep us safe and well have any idea about crisis communications. Assuming H1N1 is a crisis, then there are some basic rules about how to communicate with the public: Be clear; be consistent; seem competent; and talk to people that other people will go to for information, like physicians.</p>
<p>But here's what you find when you go to the Public Health Agency of Canada's fightflu.ca website. I wanted to know if and when I should be vaccinated, so I clicked on "vaccine." A pop-up menu offered me the following choices: Pandemic Vaccine Prioritization Framework; Guidance on H1N1 Vaccine Sequencing; and a News Release on Vaccine Sequencing that came up as "file not found." Give them an Fon ability to communicate with ordinary mortals.</p>
<p>The government of Ontario gets higher marks for simplicity of communications. They have a nice little graphic of a five-point prevention program that ends with "Get seasonal and H1N1 flu shots." Yup, been trying to do that. They deserve an A for effort, but a D for making it so difficult to follow their own advice.</p>
<p>Ontario's vaccine triage list is a little different than the federal list: Seniors are at the top of the second wave in Ontario, at the bottom of the federal list. The authoritative Centre for Disease Control is different again than the federal and provincial lists. So much for consistency among those who ought to know -- give them D minus.</p>
<p>Then they all deserve an F for failing to seem competent. Like everyone who has dutifully followed their guidelines to get a seasonal flu shot over the years, I find it disturbing to know we may be at greater risk of H1N1. The authorities don't seem to be sure about this, and while it's interesting to see them publicly debate the issue, it sure doesn't add to our confidence.</p>
<p>Finally, it's our family health-care team -- doctors, nurse practitioners, school nurses and community health centres -- who we'll look to for answers. The flu gurus should be certain these people are the first to know. Big fat F for failure to communicate with key stakeholders.</p>
<p>In our extended household, which includes small children, seniors, 30- and 40-somethings, and those with underlying medical conditions, there's frustration and anxiety. And we're all Internet-savvy researchers and keen media watchers. Imagine how the news of pandemic feels to newcomers, those with poor literacy skills or folks without an adequate health-care network.</p>
<p>Much as We Respect Those in Charge of Pandemic Planning, It's Time They Stopped Debating, Discussing and Holding Endless News Conferences, and Together Started Clear, Consistent and Effective Action So Everyone Can Get the Vaccines They Need Now. It Better Happen Soon: My Pandemic Preparation Prioritization Framework Is Running Out of Clean Sleeves and Disinfecting Wipes.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A non-reunion reunion; Larry David once famously swore he would never stage a Seinfeld reunion, but tonight on Curb Your Enthusiasm, the late, great sitcom's four stars are back together</b>

</p>
<p>Larry David didn't want to shake hands. Nothing personal - no hard feelings at work here. It was, in fact, a very pleasant, amiable lunch between the three of us: me, and the two Larrys, the funny, neurotic, cranky, fictional star of Curb Your Enthusiasm, and the funny, neurotic, less cranky, real-life man who created the celebrated HBO show, now a couple episodes into its seventh season.</p>
<p>But what made the "no-shake" stance unusual was the introductory handshake. No hesitation there. Firm, direct. "Hi, I'm Larry David," said one of the Larrys who was dressed casually like the character - blue long sleeve T-shirt, khaki pants, glasses.</p>
<p>Then, at a corner table inside the upscale Stefan's in Santa Monica, the famous 62-year-old recognizes some television executives. He wanders over, says hello, and quickly returns. "I just shook four hands," said Larry, grimacing. That tally includes mine. "You have any Purell?" he asks, looking for hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>Not on me. He politely excuses himself to wash his hands. "How could a guy like me not be carrying Purell?" he wondered aloud.</p>
<p>The moment is the stuff Curb (or Seinfeld, Larry's other baby) is made of. It's like being forced into a double goodbye from a party, violating the 10 p.m. cutoff for phone calls or any of the hundreds of other mountain-out-of-mole-hill social situations that routinely play out on what is arguably the funniest show on television.</p>
<p>Larry, whose hypochondria functions as a critical plot device in today's highly anticipated kickoff to Curb's so-called "Seinfeld reunion" story arc, has reasonably good intentions, but they're misconstrued. With the H1N1 virus lurking around every corner and whatever else lingers on the human hand, he's not being rude, simply being health conscious.</p>
<p>"He means well," said one of the Larrys, probably the real one. "He tries to do the right thing and gets in trouble for it."</p>
<p>Some Curb seasons, Larry doesn't do any press interviews. That's only one of the advantages to having a critically beloved hit show on a premium cable channel. It also doesn't hurt to have a small fortune - even after a 2007 divorce from environmental activist ex-wife Laurie - thanks to co-creating Seinfeld. No offence intended, but speaking to a journalist isn't his idea of a fun afternoon.</p>
<p>"I don't like reading what I have to say, so I don't like other people reading what I have to say either," he said. "I'm not in control of it. I can't edit this conversation, and if I could it would be a lot different than what you're going to do with it."</p>
<p>It would certainly be funnier.</p>
<p>But Larry wants to promote his show's end to the Seinfeld diaspora, after once famously swearing that he would never stage a reunion. While Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Jerry Seinfeld have all been on previous Curb episodes as individuals, the Seinfeld gang has never appeared together on the show. Now, the foursome, including Michael Richards, returns as their reunion story line unfolds over five episodes.</p>
<p>Hence, Larry is willing to submit to some media torture over a lunch.</p>
<p>"I don't see any upside. I see all downside," he told me raising his voice, then reining it back in. "I could say something and then I'll get phone calls, 'Why did you say that about me? I thought we were friends.' Who needs that?"</p>
<p>So, here we are talking about the non-reunion-reunion on his almost entirely improvised comedy show. The conceit for today's episode is comically simple - Larry's desire to win back his (onscreen) ex-wife, Cheryl, now an actress, overrides his utter disdain for a Seinfeld network special. The reunion show will go on, after all, and he promises to cast his ex in it. Of course, problems ensue. Many, many problems.</p>
<p>Other than that, Larry remains mostly reticent on specific plot details. Are you going to handle Richards's 2006 racist comedy club tirade? "People are wondering how we're going to address it," he said. "Yeah, we address it."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>As Curb viewers know, a good portion of Larry's life takes place in nice restaurants, which like any experience for him can be fraught with peril. When he walks into the main dining room, a couple patrons exclaim "Larry David! Larry David!" He admits with a shrug that he's gotten used to it but still finds the shout-outs annoying.</p>
<p>In person, he's as trim as he looks on television. That 10 pounds television is supposed to add hasn't in his case. And despite knockin' on senior citizenship's door, he appears not to have aged since Curb began in 2000.</p>
<p>Time to order. He wants a salad. Meg Ryan of When Harry Met Sally fame, who, by the way, is in tonight's episode, comes to mind.</p>
<p>"You may not like this," he starts with the waiter. "But is the egg chopped up? Or do you just put half an egg in there?"</p>
<p>Any way you'd like, answers the waiter.</p>
<p>"OK, do it with the egg whites, no bacon or ham. And very light on the blue cheese. That's the Larry David salad. And throw some cucumbers in there too. Tell the chef I apologize, but that's the only way I can eat."</p>
<p>Then, Larry explains he's a vegetarian - most of the time.</p>
<p>"When I get bored and when I can't take it anymore, I'll eat chicken," he said. How long does it take to get bored? "Ten days. No, a week."</p>
<p>He knows he has issues. When asked about Dr. Phil's brief appearance on Curb's second episode, he declares: "I like him. I would definitely go to Dr. Phil if I could. You know what? I'm putting this out there right now that if he would take me, I'm going. Does he still have patients? I don't know if my problems are big enough for what he's used to."</p>
<p>A more immediate problem surfaces, and Dr. Phil is nowhere in sight. Larry spots something in his salad.</p>
<p>"Is that a scallion?" he frowns. "I've got a date tonight."</p>
<p>When informed he's probably one of the most eligible bachelors in town, he laughs.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't go that far," he said.</p>
<p>You're rich, you're famous - you've got a great sense of humour.</p>
<p>"Women don't like the humour when it's combined with inconsideration and insensitivity," he corrects.</p>
<p>In real life, to some, his actions may be taken for inconsideration and insensitivity, but in the make-believe world of Curb it's always hilarious and, to Larry, completely authentic.</p>
<p>"This show is the only chance that I have to be honest about anything," Larry said. "Your life generally is so dishonest. Your dealings with your fellow human beings are so dishonest, everything is so dishonest, to have this opportunity to be honest is very refreshing to me."</p>
<p>Later, in the parking lot, the farewells are said. No handshake.</p>
<p>"Yeah, this was fun," Larry said.</p>
<p>Curb Your Enthusiasm is on HBO Canada tonight at 9 p.m.</p>

<p>For 10-year-old Dylan Thompson, there's nothing cooler than looking at germs.</p>
<p>Which is why it was nearly impossible to pry the child away from the dozens of displays and videos set up throughout the hallways of the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health yesterday.</p>
<p>For the first time since it opened in 1999, the centre swung its doors wide to the public Saturday afternoon to celebrate its 10-year history. The national lab works with the most dangerous viruses on the planet, including Ebola, tuberculosis, and more recently, H1N1.</p>
<p>Thompson, a Grade 5 student, spent two hours around the lab's main concourse, peering through microscopes at petri dishes.</p>
<p>"I just like science a lot," Thompson said, shoving his hands through the gloves of a mobile lab kit. "It's exciting to look at germs under the microscope and see them grow."</p>
<p>Thompson's mother, Heather, said the event was a perfect fit for her son, who earned an honorary medal at the provincial science fair in April for a project on germs.</p>
<p>"It's completely up his alley, especially because he wants to be a scientist," she said.</p>
<p>The centre, known colloquially as "the virology lab," includes the National Microbiology Lab and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease. It was one of the first facilities of its kind in the world to deal with highly infectious material that affects both human and animal health. The lab contains Level 3 and Level 4 labs -- the two spaces that house some of the most virulent germs.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Plummer, scientific director of the National Microbiology Laboratory, said the event was a chance to "tell the story" of the lab.</p>
<p>"It gets told in pieces, but not often enough," Plummer said. "It's rare for people to come in and get a chance to see what we do. They can be confident the lab is safe and not a risk to the community."</p>
<p>More than 1,000 people dropped by the lab yesterday to catch the closest glimpse they'll ever get at scientists working behind the scenes, researching and creating vaccines. Security was very tight, but video feeds were set up so visitors could see scientists working in a Level 4 lab and ask them questions.</p>
<p>"We wanted to get inside and find out what they do," said one visitor, Colleen Walker. "It's interesting to meet the people who work here and ask them questions."</p>
<p>Plummer said he was "pleasantly surprised" by the day's turnout.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of interest in what we do and a lot of pride in the community about what we do. Events like this help to improve the public's knowledge that we know how to work safely with these bugs.</p>
<p>"This lab is paid by Canadian taxes," he added. "To the extent that we can, we need to make that open to them."</p>

<p>Public health officials cancelled a breastfeeding challenge in Montreal over H1N1 flu concerns, but a possible pandemic couldn't keep Calgary moms from gathering downtown to promote breastfeeding this weekend.</p>
<p>Sixty-four babies latched on to their mothers' breasts at exactly 11 a. m. on Saturday while at Eau Claire Market for the 2009 Global Breastfeeding Challenge.</p>
<p>"This event is to raise awareness about breastfeeding and promote its benefits, as well as to normalize it," said Calgary co-organizer Peanut White. "It's about solidarity, community support. For our event, we also have lots of resources available here so mothers can come and learn."</p>
<p>Calgary's official participant count was 72 mothers breastfeeding 78 babies.</p>
<p>Due to flu concerns, the Quintessence Foundation, which sponsors the event, allowed for concerned mothers to breastfeed at home, said White.</p>
<p>"We have not heard anything from anyone in Calgary who was concerned at all. For me, it was never really an issue. It crossed my mind only when I learned Montreal had cancelled," White said.</p>

<p>BETHESDA, Maryland -- In the long, long line of people who were waiting to see the president of the United States, the fellow in front of me had only one leg and the woman behind me, a researcher at the National Cancer Institute, had just lost her husband to a tumor in his colon that his doctors didn't find in time.</p>
<p>"His mother lived to be 102 and his aunts to 105 and 106," his widow was saying. "He had longevity in his genes." But she had lost her man to cancer anyway, long before what should have been his hour.</p>
<p>I thought of an old Chinese proverb: There is medicine for sickness, but none for fate.</p>
<p>"Do you ever wonder what will get you?" I asked the woman from the Cancer Institute.</p>
<p>"Not since my husband died," she replied. "I've had too many tragedies for anything to faze me now."</p>
<p>We were at the National Institutes of Health, snaking slowly toward a security check to enter an auditorium named for founding director Jack Masur, MD (died suddenly of an acute myocardial infarction, 1969) in a building named for Senator Warren Magnuson of Washington state (died of diabetic complications after having one foot amputated, 1989). The president of the United States was going to make a speech about increased funding for medical research as part of his mega-mega-million-dollar stimulus of America's anesthetized economy.</p>
<p>Walking in, I glanced at the magazine rack in the gift shop in the main lobby of the great, publicly funded hospital and noticed that Edward Kennedy (died of brain cancer, 2009) was on the cover of Newsweek and Patrick Swayze (died of pancreatic cancer, 2009) was on the front of this week's People. Mortality was hip.</p>
<p>We took our seats in the theatre and Barack Obama walked on stage. The audience stood and roared and screamed and cheered, just as you would if your boss told you that he was delivering $5 billion worth of kindling to stoke the fires of your enterprise. That's what the president was bringing to the NIH: five cool billion. The purpose of this largesse, Barack Obama said, would be "to unlock treatments to diseases that have long plagued humanity, to save and enrich the lives of people all over the world."</p>
<p>He called the $5 billion "the single largest boost to biomedical research in history," but if you did the math, it worked out to only 74 cents for every person alive on Earth (6,787,570,618 as of Friday, according to the U.S. Census Bureau) and aboard the International Space Station (nine, including the guy from Cirque du Soleil).</p>
<p>The lion's share of the money, the president said, would go to research in cancer.</p>
<p>"Cancer has touched the lives of all Americans, including my own family's," Barack Obama said. And this was true; his mother had died of a malignant tumor in her ovaries that one doctor in Indonesia had diagnosed as indigestion. He spoke for about 15 minutes and then flew off to solve Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Leaving the hall, it was difficult for me not to notice a woman sitting in a wheelchair with a surgical mask covering her nose and mouth. This was Barbara Lynn Foraker from the state of Delaware, where she operates a small heating oil delivery company.</p>
<p>I assumed Ms. Foraker must have been trying to protect Barack Obama from the swine flu, but I was wrong. About five years ago, she had noticed a small, dark spot under the nail of her big toe.</p>
<p>"It looked like a pencil mark," she told me. Her dermatologist thought it was a fungal stain of some sort. It wasn't. It was myeloma, and by the time the doctors figured this out and cut her toe off, the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes.</p>
<p>I thought of Groucho Marx: "No matter what I treat 'em for, they die of something else." But this was no comedy.</p>
<p>Ms. Foraker had been installed at NIH for a treatment that she called "the newest and greatest."</p>
<p>"I've been perfectly healthy my whole life," she said. "I have one thing: it's myeloma. Other than the one thing, I'm a healthy person."</p>
<p>The newest and greatest treatment seemed to be working, the woman in the surgical mask said. I told her that I wished her five billion dollars worth of hope. Then I drove home to check my toes.</p>

<div>475 words</div><div>4 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>Sports teams, church congregations and Olympic athletes are among groups in B.C. being warned to stop shaking hands until the threat of H1N1 abates.</p>
<p>The B.C. Soccer Association has posted an advisory on its website warning clubs, districts and leagues about the need to stop the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>It is encouraging parents to "keep their children away from the soccer environment if they are showing any signs of infectious illness or virus," and to "ensure full recovery prior to returning to play."</p>
<p>On the field, players are being told to "use your own water bottle . . . avoid direct lip contact with the container and do not use sport-drink bottles that don't squirt."</p>
<p>Teams are also being asked to consider "alternate ways to shake opponents' hands at the end of the match" -- such as "a group cheer or a pass-by without contact."</p>
<p>Bjorn Osieck, executive director of the BCSA, which represents 125,000 players, said the guidelines are just common sense.</p>
<p>"In any regular flu season, this seems to be a prudent thing to consider. And certainly under the whole H1N1 situation, it's probably even more timely and important."</p>
<p>B.C. hockey teams are also ramping up regulations in preparation for hockey and flu seasons.</p>
<p>"We are recommending that if they are going to shake hands, they should do it with their gloves on instead of with their bare hands," said B.C. Hockey vice-president Shannon Bell, whose association represents about 50,000 youth.</p>
<p>Hockey Canada hasn't outlawed handshaking, but instead is stressing hand-washing.</p>
<p>B.C. Hockey president Rick Boekestyn said his organization trusts that the hygiene measures will keep the virus at bay.</p>
<p>Professional athletes are also avoiding unnecessary contact. Last week, medical officials with the Canadian Olympic Committee advised athletes to give elbow taps or nods instead of shaking hands or kissing cheeks while greeting other athletes at the 2010 Games.</p>
<p>The Olympics are "where viruses of the world come to meet," warned COC chief medical officer Dr. Bob McCormack.</p>
<p>Even churches are advising sick parishioners to miss mass, omit the sign-of-peace handshake and alter Communion rituals for flu season.</p>
<p>"Missing mass due to illness is not sinful; it is prudent and shows respect for your brothers and sisters," Archbishop of Vancouver Most Reverend J. Michael Miller explained on the Roman Catholic Archdiocese website -- adding that, "at the Sign of Peace, you may choose to make a slight bow, without offering your hand."</p>
<p>The diocese, which oversees 86 B.C. parishes, also advised churches to stop offering Communion "wine" from shared chalices and has ordered ministers to wash hands before and after administering communion.</p>

No one likes having a needle, but if you reassure your child that there are ways to make the hurt go away, you can help them have a less painful experience.</p>
<p>There are several ways parents can ease the ordeal. The key, according to her, is to be creative and use the right combination of tactics depending on your child's age and fear level.</p>
<p>Tips to minimize the pain:</p>
<p>n With young children, bring soap bubbles and blow bubbles during the injection, suggesting they are "blowing away the hurt."</p>
<p>n With a crying infant, if the parent places the plastic bubble-maker in front of the child's mouth, as they cry out, they will make bubbles. Zeltzer has seen babies stop in mid-cry because they were distracted by the bubbles.</p>
<p>n Bubbles might not work with older children, but parents can help the child to breathe out slowly as if he/she were blowing up a big balloon.</p>
<p>n Ahead of time ask your doctor about a numbing cream or for the specific areas to be injected.</p>
<p>n If your doctor approves, give your child a pain reliever, such as Tylenol, about one hour ahead. On returning home, put an ice bag on the injection site to reduce local swelling and pain.</p>
<p>SLEEPING SAFELY</p>
<p>Many adults still are unaware of the best way to put a baby to sleep which as a result may actually increase the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) according to a poll by Pennsylvania Medical Society.</p>
<p>When asked in which position is best for a baby to sleep, only 54.5 per cent correctly identified the back while 26.1 per cent replied the baby's side and 19.5 per cent said the stomach.</p>
<p>Infants who sleep on their stomachs and sides have a much higher rate of SIDS than those on their backs, according to the American SIDS Institute. Consequently the Institute and many other organizations suggest parents place infants on their backs to sleep.</p>

<p>Governors, boards of directors and businesses have come and gone over the last three decades at the Greater Victoria Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>But one thing hasn't changed about the business group since 1980 -- and that's been the day-to-day management of the often hectic chamber office, which serves more than 1,500 members.</p>
<p>The glue has been manager Linda Kitchen, who was honoured last night as National Staff Person of the Year at an awards ceremony to</p>
<p>kick off the Canadian Chamber of Commerce annual convention in Victoria.</p>
<p>It's a well-deserved award for Kitchen, who started with the organization in 1980 and has worked with 29 governors and boards of directors in managing daily activities of members, finances and human resources.</p>
<p>"Her dedication to the chamber and business community is unequalled," said Victoria chamber CEO Bruce Carter.</p>
<p>"We are a very busy chamber and it is really Linda who keeps the ship on course."</p>

<p>Bill Lewis is home again.</p>
<p>After spending almost 20 years with the Coast Hotels chain, Lewis has been named general</p>
<p>manager of the Magnolia Hotel and Spa downtown. Lewis had been at the Coast Harbourside in James Bay for 12 years -- working his way from night bellman to director of operations -- before managing the Coast Vancouver Airport and two of the company's properties in Edmonton for the past five years.</p>
<p>With two small children, he's happy to return to the city where he was raised and cut his teeth in the industry.</p>
<p>Lewis replaces Jana Cornelius in the top post at the 64-room Magnolia, a four diamond boutique hotel built in 1998 and for years ranked as one of Canada's top hotels by Conde Nast Traveller. "It is a beautiful property, one of the country's finest, and I want to build on that reputation," said Lewis, 35.</p>
<p>The Magnolia completed a remodelling earlier this year, adding Prime Steakhouse & Lounge and Spa Magnolia on the ground floor.</p>

<p>Kelly Mann -- one of the founders of Greater Victoria KidSport and a major reason the local chapter is the largest in B.C. and No. 2 in Canada based on kids helped and dollars raised -- is resigning as chairman after nine years.</p>
<p>"[It's] a long time in a volunteer position, especially in a leadership role, and other things are now calling for my time," Mann said.</p>
<p>He cited family commitments and his position as chief executive of the B.C. Games Society, which has challenges ahead with plans for a new model for sport and changes in funding.</p>
<p>KidsSport has helped nearly 2,500 youth between the ages of five and 18 and issued $350,000 in funding since its inception.</p>
<p>The group supports families with enrolment costs so no kids are shut out of their favourite sport because of money. Mann said prospective replacements will be approached and a replacement should be named no later than year end.</p>

<p>Chemistry Consulting has confirmed what most in the tourism industry already know -- July wasn't exactly a banner month for tourism in Victoria.</p>
<p>Statistics compiled by Chemistry principal Frank Bourree are almost all in the red. Average occupancy in the region's 4,400 hotel rooms dipped to 63 per cent over the first seven months of 2009 -- down more than three per cent. The average daily room rate is off by $5.59 to $123.59 and revenue per available room slipped $7.73 to $77.93. Traffic at the Victoria International Airport was down two per cent from last year while B.C. Ferries traffic has also slipped -- vehicles are down one per cent, passengers by three per cent and buses almost 20 per cent.</p>
<p>The only bright spot on the numbers grid is at the Victoria Conference Centre, which is showing delegate days increasing 15 per cent to 64,261.</p>
<p>Bourree said in a note with his numbers : "Tourism operators can be forgiven for feeling battered and bruised this summer with challenges coming their way from every direction. The</p>
<p>U.S. market's 20-year</p>
<p>low, the ministry's absorption of Tourism B.C., the HST plan, H1N1, Mexican visa issues and cross-border challenges are all having an effect on travel."</p>

</p>
<p>The All Nations Hope AIDS Network (ANHAN) is on high alert while it waits for the second wave of the H1N1 virus to hit.</p>
<p>Margaret Akan, chief executive officer for ANHAN, said her staff is accustomed to working with viruses, but is now stepping up its safety precautions in order to protect their clientele.</p>
<p>"We are certainly looking at universal precautions -- and sticking to those universal precautions and upping the care we're taking in disinfecting and cleaning," said Akan.</p>
<p>ANHAN is also networking with the national organization Canadian AIDS Treatment Information Exchange, in order to keep on top of information regarding HIV/AIDS and the H1N1 virus, Akan said, adding the health region also provides up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Although ANHAN is taking extra precautions this flu season, the organization will continue to treat clients with compassion, said Akan.</p>
<p>"We have an understanding of that within our organization, because we've always dealt with illness and disease," she explained, adding ANHAN promotes the wellness concept equally among staff and clients.</p>
<p>"In some of the programs we're offering, in working with clients we are saying (that) anyone who is knowingly sick, coughing -- we'll ask them to leave and if they do not want to leave, we will offer them a mask," said Akan.</p>
<p>ANHAN is also looking at new and innovative ways to keep everyone from getting sick.</p>
<p>"We are dealing with populations that are at risk, so we need to be acknowledging that we are more on the alert," she said.</p>
<p>Akan is part of the National Aboriginal Council for HIV/AIDS and the group met two weeks ago.</p>
<p>"There was discussion at this meeting in terms about what's going on with H1N1, which is also a virus," said Akan. "But to see the amount of human and financial resources that are put into this virus is alarming to us. Because here we are with HIV, lacking financial and human resources and as soon as these new viruses pop up, the government is at it."</p>
<p>Although she supports the government's quick action in regards to H1N1, she believes the same attention should be paid to HIV/AIDS because of recently released statistics.</p>
<p>"This is an opportunity for us to include HIV with what is going on with H1N1. It's opening the for us to be inclusive about it," said Akan.</p>
<p>She said ANHAN is doing all that it can to share H1N1 information with staff and clients, but until the virus hits, there is no way of knowing what kind of impact it will have in the community.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Employees play big role in pandemic preparedness</b>
</div><div>Derek Sankey </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>653 words</div><div>3 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>D10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>When an employee came back to work at <span class="companylink">McElhanney Land Surveys Ltd</span>. earlier this year after visiting Mexico, managers had the worker visit a doctor to get cleared before coming back to work to ensure the safety of its workforce and to allay fears.</p>
<p>That was the first wave.</p>
<p>During the anticipated second wave this fall, that strategy won't work.</p>
<p>Experts predict up to 30 per cent of the workforce could fall ill with the H1N1 influenza virus this fall and pandemic planners say most companies haven't done enough to prepare.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that all indications are that the swine flu will hit hard," says Bob Klay, a business continuity planner with Klay Management Ltd.</p>
<p>"Too many companies are not very prepared."</p>
<p>Many companies are lulled into a false sense of preparedness because they have some kind of policy, but the devil is always in the details and execution is what really matters in a pandemic.</p>
<p>McElhanney's health, safety and environment manager, Darrell Florence, began developing a pandemic plan in 2006 after the appearance of avian flu, or H5N1.</p>
<p>He knows there's lots of information and pandemic plans available, but says tailoring available plans to every individual organization is what will make the difference when flu hits.</p>
<p>"Off-the-shelf is a great place to start, but you have to identify the risks relative your own individual business," says Florence, who has employees working at remote work camps scattered across the province and office workers in Calgary and Edmonton.</p>
<p>His pandemic planning team brought in Juanita House, a registered nurse and occupational health and wellness specialist, to refine the company's pandemic plan.</p>
<p>"Anybody can get access to a pandemic policy ... and re-word it the way they want, but does it really work the way you want when it gets down to the implementation level? You have to bring it into the business and actually make it work for people," says House.</p>
<p>Pandemic planning guidelines are available through the World Health Organization, the Public Health Agency of Canada and other organizations, but that's just a starting point from a business context.</p>
<p>Accuracy and execution are critical factors to any pandemic plan, says Klay.</p>
<p>There are often many considerations people have not thought about or haven't addressed how to overcome if they occur.</p>
<p>"The problem with influenza ... is that you can be infectious, contagious, before you're symptomatic and that's where a lot of fear gets ratcheted up," says Pat Pitsel, president of consulting firm Pitsel and Associates.</p>
<p>Companies need to start with figuring out how to manage without a third of their staff, how to provide services to customers during the pandemic -- people tend to stay as isolated as possible -- identify critical positions in the company and cross-train to ensure continued operations and look at all aspects of operations and safety for workers.</p>
<p>Work refusals could become a problem for companies.</p>
<p>Security is another big risk, both physical security and information technology security. Many firms plan to let employees work from home, but that poses risks, too.</p>
<p>Florence and his team, for example, have developed a virtual private network that allows workers to log in securely at home to company servers from corporate laptops.</p>
<p>Pitsel says there have already been questions raised about the Internet's ability to handle the increased traffic from a third of the global workforce working remotely.</p>
<p>With every plan, it comes down to communication with employees and getting workers on board with doing everything they can to minimize the risks.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>THESE BOOTS AREN"T MADE FOR WALKING; Chauvinist shackles or Amazon equipment? Only bootologists know for sure what the season's sky-high styles are really saying</b>
</div><div>SARAH HAMPSON </div>
<div>1200 words</div><div>3 October 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>L1</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

<p>shampson@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>I am thinking of becoming a bootologist. That way, I could try to help the public understand what the heck the designers are saying about the world with this season's boots – and what those who wear them are saying about themselves.</p>
<p>Because we are saying something. These boots are not made for walking.</p>
<p>This is a Big Boot Moment. There are platform booties, over-the-knee stilettos and thigh-high boots with buckles, straps and frilly bits best described as Baroque architecture on stilts.</p>
<p>Stuart Weitzman offers slim, thigh-high black boots that look like elegant, long gloves, but for the legs. Rick Owens shows boots that are tight at the knee and ankle but have sail-like, draping flaps at the calves. And no one can tell me Miuccia Prada's leather hip waders did not cause her to imagine lying prostrate on the ground trying to wiggle into them before attaching the garter-like straps.</p>
<p>A boot valet is clearly required.</p>
<p>Maybe we are just supposed to laugh. (Well, they succeeded there.) Fashion is frivolity, after all. And maybe part of the fun is to amuse ourselves with the commentary the boots – which connote an activity such as fishing, hunting or riding – make on modern female existence. We catch and release men, angle for promotions and hunt for how to be happy with our choices.</p>
<p>Bootology has a very serious side. Many pointy heads have deconstructed pointy toes and heels. The meaning of hemlines – if you believe in fashion as a reflection of the zeitgeist – is a mere paragraph compared with the possible textbooks of meanings for boots, which involve a mix of history, iconography, psychology, sexuality, statement and irony.</p>
<p>Take those Prada waders. I wondered what we feel we are sloshing through as a society at the moment. Red ink? The possible danger of rising sea levels? The threat of the invisible H1N1 virus? All of the above?</p>
<p>Gird your loins, indeed.</p>
<p>And then I checked in with other bootologists, a.k.a. Fashionistas Who Think, to discover that boots are the pathway to the genitals. (And you thought they were meant to draw the eye to your feet! Ha!) Never, it turns out, have the female loins been so boldly showcased.</p>
<p>Thigh-high boots “visually emphasize female sexuality, drawing the eye to the centre of sexual difference,” observes Elizabeth Semmelhack, curator of the <span class="companylink">Bata Shoe</span> Museum in Toronto and author of Heights of Fashion: A History of the Elevated Shoe. “If shoes are the beginning of the leg, reminding people where the leg starts, boots take that story even closer and higher to the goal.”</p>
<p>According to Semmelhack, women's boots came on the scene in a big way in the 19th century. They coincided with hoop skirts, which tended to tilt in a wind, requiring a covering for modesty. That lasted until the Suffragette movement. “When women get the right to vote and the Twenties kick in,” she says, “boots go away, hemlines go up, shoes become more fashionable, and boots don't come back until the 1960s.”</p>
<p>That's when go-go boots, paired with the mini-dress (and celebrated in Nancy Sinatra's 1966 hit These Boots are Made for Walkin'), became an expression of female sexual liberation and empowerment – a moment in fashion that is still being played out.</p>
<p>But wait: Here's an ironic twist. While thigh-high boots suggest aggression, a layer of armour, they also communicate vulnerability, Semmelhack points out. “When you have a pair of hip waders paired with the briefest of cardigans and that bare skin is exposed between the top of the boot and the bottom of the cardigan, it seems, to me, to draw the eyes to the most vulnerable part of the body. … She's protected up to her thigh and, after that, she's open game.” The boots are leather lingerie, in effect.</p>
<p>Sex and high heels have long been interconnected in the public's erotic imagination, thanks to the influence of pornography. As we all know, to observe that a woman wears sensible shoes is to suggest she has a limited libido. Boots, in particular, are linked to fantasy.</p>
<p>“Basically, boots suggest a masculine military style. They always come with the communication of aggression, power, the sound of marching boots, the transformation into warrior,” says Valerie Steele, author of several books, including Fetish: Fashion, Sex & Power, and director of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. “When women adopted boots, it's about sexualized phallic women – Amazons, in part – that play to the male sexual fantasy of female dominance,” she explains. The more substantial the boot, the higher it goes up the leg, the more phallic it becomes.</p>
<p>Think of it this way, ladies: Buy those thigh-high boots and you are sporting a 24-inch penis – two, in fact.</p>
<p>Still, some of the women in architectural sky-high heels look more like damsels in distress than phallic towers of strength. Check out the boots of Emma Heming, the new 32-year-old wife of 54-year-old actor Bruce Willis, in the fetishy photo shoot the newlyweds did with Steven Klein. Her black boots have a heavy, sculptural heel and, in one image, she is cradled in her husband's arms, as if unable to walk on her own. Consider, too, Victoria Beckham's heel-less, crotch-high PVC boots, which support only the balls (pardon me) of her feet. Good thing she had her husband to hold onto.</p>
<p>What does it all mean? Well, not everyone thinks we should be looking to fashion for messages about anything – economic trends, the role of women, our collective fears and wishes. “People want fashion to be a formula, a shorthand to cultural concerns. But it doesn't work that way,” Steele says. Craft innovations, such as zippers and new textiles, have greater influence.</p>
<p>Semmelhack, on the other hand, sees all kinds of meaning. “The last time you saw highly inventive shoes [like today's] was during the Great Depression. I don't know if it has something to do with cycles of fashion or if there is some kind of link between depressive economic situations and this shift to almost surrealist architectural footwear.” One possibility, she notes, is that highly inventive footwear is difficult to knock off, which means that it signifies the wealth of the wearer.</p>
<p>The contradictions in this fall's boot designs should be analyzed as part of their message, Semmelhack adds. “If you are covering yourself up … but at the same time allowing so much of the rest of the body to be so visually vulnerable, either it's an expression about the inconsistencies with which we face our fears or the overarching message is that, ultimately, there's nothing to fear.”</p>
<p>Well, there you have it – a small part, anyway. For lighter reading, I would suggest turning to the business section. Don't they all wear Oxfords over there?</p>

<p>Calling all health-care workers</p>
<p>THE Manitoba government is asking health-care workers to come forward and help during the flu pandemic.</p>
<p>"Manitoba's health-care workers have already done a tremendous job responding to H1N1 and we can count on their knowledge, compassion and care during the upcoming flu season," Health Minister Theresa Oswald said.</p>
<p>"Many other Manitobans have skills that will help strengthen our flu preparation and response, so I encourage them to respond to our call to action."</p>
<p>Manitoba is looking for front-line health-care providers and support staff including:</p>
<p>doctors, nurses and nurse practitioners (registered or retired) to administer vaccinations or to work in immunization clinics;</p>
<p>people who have had experience working in immunization clinics, either to greet or register visitors;</p>
<p>nurses and other health-care providers with experience in intensive-care units; and</p>
<p>doctors, nurses and nurse practitioners willing to provide medical support in remote or northern communities.</p>
<p>Health-care workers will be matched with regional health authorities based on their skills and local need. To get more information or to register, health-care workers should call 1-866-799-0174 or email calltoaction@gov.mb.ca.</p>

<p>Soccer teams across the province have red-carded an old tradition -- the post-match handshake -- because of fears it could spread the H1N1 virus among players.</p>
<p>"We're asking our members to celebrate their opposition in another way," said Sharon Marejka, executive director of the Lower Island Soccer Association, with 1,000 under-18 teams from Duncan to Sooke and Saltspring Island.</p>
<p>"We're not saying snub your opposition by not shaking their hand -- [instead] give a cheer or something at the end."</p>
<p>Not only will players stop shaking hands -- coaches and referees have been asked to as well, she said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Assembly of First Nations elects B.C. regional chief; Jody Wilson Raybould is a former Crown prosecutor who lives on Quadra Island</b>
</div><div>Denise Ryan   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>578 words</div><div>3 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Jody Wilson Raybould, the newly elected B.C. regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said Friday that this is a time of hope for the province's first nations communities.</p>
<p>"We are in an amazing time of change and opportunity," said the 38-year-old Wilson Raybould. "I'm very honoured to have been elected by these chiefs."</p>
<p>The sense of being born to a cause is reflected both in the elegance of Wilson Raybould's bearing and in the eloquence of her speech.</p>
<p>Her traditional name -- Puglaas -- was given to her by her maternal grandmother and means: "a woman born to noble people."</p>
<p>She said it was both her grandmother, the matriarch of her Eagle clan, and her aunt Donna who instilled in her a sense of duty to her community, and dragged her "kicking and screaming" to protests and meetings when she was a child.</p>
<p>"I was taught that you sit and you listen, and that's what I did," she said. "I would have rather been playing ball with my friends."</p>
<p>She is still listening -- and she is playing ball, albeit on a much bigger court.</p>
<p>A former provincial Crown prosecutor in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, Wilson Raybould knows the ropes of the legal system.</p>
<p>She hopes to build on the successes of past first nations leaders in using the courts "to implement our aboriginal title and rights in appropriate ways."</p>
<p>Improved standards of living, education, self-governance and health are not the only areas in which work is needed, said Wilson Raybould.</p>
<p>Individual culture, traditional ways, and hopes and concerns vary from nation to nation and that's where the listening comes in.</p>
<p>"Every community is different. One of the indicators of success in thriving cultures is the practice of [individual] ways," she said. "I believe in every nation's right to choose their way of moving forward."</p>
<p>Inspiring others to join in moving forward positively and effectively is part of Wilson Raybould's vision.</p>
<p>"I know there are many members in our communities that do not see the opportunities we have," she said.</p>
<p>Urgent concerns, including the development of further strategies to deal with "the obvious immediate effects of H1N1," are pressing, along with the complex, overarching goal of developing strong self-governance.</p>
<p>Wilson Raybould said first nations communities must "come out from under" the rule of the Indian Act -- legislation enacted in 1876 by the Canadian government that made assimilation and land management its primary goals.</p>
<p>The Indian Act "manages 'Indian people' from birth to death," she said, and is the only act of legislation in Canada that singles out and governs citizens by race.</p>
<p>"The message I want to get out to our community is any move from out under the Indian Act that is appropriate has to happen."</p>
<p>Wilson Raybould hopes to build on opportunities created by past leaders who have made advances through the courts in implementing rights to self-determination.</p>
<p>Wilson Raybould, the daughter of noted aboriginal leader Bill Wilson, is a four-time elected commissioner to the BC Treaty Commission and a member of the We Wai Kai First Nation. She lives in Cape Mudge Village on Quadra Island.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>McNair suicide message shelved after death; Former Titans QB made TV spots reaching out to troubled youth in state</b>

</p>
<p>Shortly before former NFL quarterback Steve McNair's mistress killed him and then herself, he recorded a public service announcement that urges young people thinking about suicide to call a hotline and "live to see better days."</p>
<p>The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities shelved the announcement after McNair's July 4 death and it never aired. The state released three versions of it to the Associated Press this week in response to a public records request.</p>
<p>In them, McNair says, "Each year, too many young people are taking their own lives. So if you're feeling really down and have even thought about suicide, call 1-800-273-TALK and live to see better days."</p>
<p>McNair donated his time to film the announcement in April on a sports field at Goodpasture Christian School in the Nashville suburb of Goodlettsville, where he had held summer youth football camps, then-department spokeswoman Jill Hudson said in July.</p>
<p>Post-production work was under way on 10-, 15-, and 30-second versions when McNair died.</p>
<p>Last year, Tennessee received a $1.5 million (U.S.) federal grant to help prevent suicide among young people. The Tennessee Suicide Prevention Network reports that suicide is the third leading cause of death for those ages 15 to 24 and about a third of Tennessee counties have suicide rates that exceed the national average.</p>
<p>Police investigating McNair's death concluded his 20-year-old mistress, Sahel Kazemi, had been "spinning out of control" in the days leading up to the shooting.</p>
<p>TOUGH TASK: The wounded Seattle Seahawks' date with Peyton Manning and the undefeated Indianapolis Colts on Sunday is one of the most daunting challenges in Jim Mora's four seasons as an NFL head coach.</p>
<p>At the most fundamental level is simply having enough quality players available.</p>
<p>Matt Hasselbeck's broken rib will prevent him from playing, so Mora said Friday his three-time Pro Bowl quarterback is "very doubtful" to play at Indianapolis. Hasselbeck has been out since he was hurt on a dive for the goal line in San Francisco on Sept. 20.</p>
<p>Also, nine-time Pro Bowl left tackle Walter Jones will not make his season debut Sunday. The Seahawks ruled him out on the injury report. Jones has delayed his attempt to get back from two knee surgeries since last winter.</p>
<p>PARKER DOUBTFUL: Steelers running back Willie Parker did not practise for a third consecutive day Friday and is not expected to play against the San Diego Chargers on Sunday night. Pittsburgh listed Parker as doubtful, but players who do not practise almost never play for them. He was expected to try running Saturday.</p>
<p>SWINE CASE: Houston Texans rookie tight end Anthony Hill was in hospital this week with swine flu in the first confirmed case for an NFL player this season. Hill is the only player on the team believed to have swine flu and other players are being monitored, Texans vice-president of communications Tony Wyllie said Friday.</p>
<p>PORTER HAMSTRUNG: Miami Dolphins linebacker Joey Porter is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buffalo Bills because of a sore hamstring, but he says he'll play hurt if he can.</p>
<p>Porter sat out practice for the third day in a row Friday. He's the only player on the Dolphins' injury report and whether he plays will be a game-time decision, coach Tony Sparano said.</p>
<p>HEAD TRAUMAS: The NFL Players Association has formed a committee to address the issue of head trauma among players.</p>
<p>The NFLPA's concussion and traumatic brain injury committee will address diagnosis, treatment and prevention of concussions and brain injuries in active players; and the long-term cumulative effects of isolated or repetitive traumatic brain injuries in NFL players as patients.</p>

<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>H1N1 flu is expected to break out locally at any time, after making its way to surrounding communities.</p>
<p>But the new flu is not expected to be an overwhelming burden when it hits. This has led planners to shelve parts of their emergency plan, drafted to respond to a global pandemic.</p>
<p>"In any flu season, people die from flu, and we know people will die from flu in this season," said Dr. Liana Nolan, medical officer of health. "But we're not anticipating it will be worse than a heavy flu season."</p>
<p>H1N1 flu sickened some local residents last spring, then disappeared. Now it appears to be spreading in Ontario again as flu season starts, sending absentee rates soaring at some schools in Hamilton. Local schools report no unusual absenteeism.</p>
<p>"It could be we're on the front end of a rise," Nolan said Friday, citing rising flu cases in neighbouring health units.</p>
<p>An eight-week wave is possible when the flu hits, she said.</p>
<p>A vaccine against the new flu will be available starting in November. It will go first to people most at risk, then to the general population.</p>
<p>A vaccine for regular flu will be available after, except for seniors over 65 who will get it this month.</p>
<p>Nolan's message to the public remains the same: Wash your hands, cough into your sleeve, and stay home if sick.</p>
<p>She has not read a new medical study that found no evidence that handwashing guards against catching H1N1. "We're recommending handwashing," she said.</p>
<p>Authorities do not intend to implement some measures from an emergency plan that was written before the current pandemic.</p>
<p>For example, there are no plans to declare an official emergency, close schools or daycares, or cancel mass gatherings.</p>
<p>There are no plans to establish special flu centres to treat sick people. If required, hours may be extended at existing health services.</p>
<p>Authorities see no need to plan for a surge in natural deaths. They do not expect absenteeism rates at workplaces to surge to 35 per cent.</p>

<p>Winter Hawks beat Cullitons</p>
<p>It took until the final 60 seconds, but the Cambridge Winter Hawks maintained their grip on first place with a 1-0 victory against the Cullitons on the road in Stratford Friday night.

<p>NHL</p>
<p>Bettman likes tourney</p>
<p>Gary Bettman likes the Olympic hockey tournament but the NHL commissioner isn't sure if it's worth halting the season when the Games are held outside of North America. In a wide-ranging interview with The Canadian Press at the start of the NHL's 92nd season, Bettman spoke at length about his views on having the world's top pro players compete at the Olympics. "The benefits of going to the Olympics when you're in Salt Lake City or Vancouver, to name two cities, are way different than if you're in Japan, Italy or Russia," said Bettman. The commissioner was a key figure in getting NHL players involved with the Games starting in 1998. However, the league's participation isn't guaranteed to continue beyond the Vancouver Olympics in February.</p>
<p>Skiing</p>
<p>Dionne forced to retire</p>
<p>VANCOUVER - Canadian freestyle skier Deidra Dionne has a brain tumour that will force her to retire. She told a news conference Friday that has a small benign tumour and will treat it with medication for now. She has no immediate plans for surgery. "There is a time and place for every athlete to retire," she said. "I believe that time for me is now." Dionne was in a fight to earn a spot on the Canadian team that will compete at the 2010 Winter Games. She was dropped to the national development team this spring after failing to crack the top 10 in any World Cup events last season. Dionne won a bronze medal at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, but then was almost paralyzed when she injured her neck in a training accident in September 2005.</p>
<p>Marriage</p>
<p>Norman, Evert split up</p>
<p>Just 15 months after they were married, golf star Greg Norman and tennis great Chris Evert announced they have separated. The announcement Friday comes three days before Norman is to captain the International team at the Presidents Cup in San Francisco, where wives of the captains take on a visible role. Norman and Evert, each in the Hall of Fame in their respective sports, did not say whether they planned to divorce.</p>

<p>I don't know if this sort of thing happens in other towns, but skunks have become a problem in New York City. They've become such a big problem that they've brought in Sarah Palin to thin the herd.</p>
<p>Sarah Palin's memoir has been published, and it's due out in November. I got an advanced copy. This time I was the one who quit half-way through.</p>
<p>People in Alaska are looking forward to the Sarah Palin memoir. They already calling it ‘the book to nowhere.'</p>

<p>President Obama and Oprah Winfrey are going to Copenhagen this week to push for Chicago to host the 2016 Olympics. The bad news is, while they're gone the country's going to be run by Joe Biden and Jerry Springer.</p>
<p>According to intelligence reports, the new standard procedure for al-Qaida operatives is to hide explosives inside their rectums. Either that, or they're just playing a cruel practical joke on Akmed.</p>
<p>Sarah Palin has finished writing her memoirs, and her publisher says, "It's her words, her life, and it's all there in full and fascinating detail." Then he said, "Or so I'm told - I wouldn't read this thing if you put a gun in my mouth."</p>
<p>A new book about why women have sex claims that women's reasons differ from pleasure to obligation to even "feeling sorry for the guy." After hearing this, men everywhere said, "Whatever . . ."</p>
<p>Jimmy Kimmel</p>
<p>Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland. This is the guy who pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in the '70s. He fled to France to avoid possible incarceration. He was in Zurich to accept an award.</p>
<p>They're very clever - they told him he was getting a Soul Train award.</p>
<p>He might be extradited to the United Sates. His lawyers are fighting it on the grounds that he won an Oscar.</p>
<p>Apparently, much of Hollywood agrees with him - more than 130 people signed a petition demanding his release. Martin Scorsese, Steven Soderbergh, Debra Winger, Harvey Weinstein David Lynch, and Woody Allen all signed. I think Woody should have sat this one out . . .</p>

<p>If the general wants to talk to Obama, get a talk show. That's how it's done.</p>
<p>To be fair, President Obama said he's been busy lately, but he would be willing to add the general as a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> friend.

<p>PRATTVILLE, Ala. -- Ninth-grader Alexis Thompson shot a 3-under 69 on Friday for a share of the lead with top-ranked Lorena Ochoa and three others after the second round of the <span class="companylink">Navistar</span> LPGA Classic.</p>
<p>The 14-year-old Thompson, from Coral Springs, Fla., is trying to become the second-youngest winner in LPGA Tour history -- and the youngest in a full event.</p>
<p>KOBE, Japan -- Eri Yoshida, the 17-year-old high school student who became Japan's first female professional baseball player and globally renowned as the "Knuckleball Girl," has turned her attention to education after struggling in her first season as a pro.</p>
<p>Yoshida pitched in her final game in the financially troubled Kansai Independent League on Thursday, working one scoreless inning of relief as her Kobe Cruise 9 lost 9-4 to the Kishu Rangers. The 5-foot, 114-pound pitcher created a stir when she signed a contract with Kobe in December, but her career didn't gain much momentum. She was 0-2 in 11 mound appearances with a 4.03 ERA, giving up seven runs in just 10 2/3 innings pitched.</p>

<p>Hill is the only player on the team believed to have swine flu.</p>

<p>About 5,200 Saskatchewan workplaces will receive the provincial government's new H1N1 pandemic Influenza planning guide.</p>
<p>The best-practice guidelines are compiled in a 36-page booklet aimed at preparing businesses and offices for an influenza pandemic.</p>
<p>Distributed by Occupational Health and Safety, the booklet offers basic H1N1 facts and help with pandemic planning to ensure labour standards are followed during a pandemic.</p>
<p>"Most workplaces will be able to rely on common sense approaches (to H1N1 prevention), but the guide will establish best practices to address concerns as they arise," said Advanced Education, Employment and Labour minister Rob Norris, who announced the new initiative on Friday.</p>
<p>The government spent $14,000 to produce and send the booklets, which should be arriving in mailboxes next week.</p>
<p>The guidelines are based on a similar package produced by the Alberta government.</p>
<p>Copes can be ordered by phone toll-free at 1-800-567-7233 and is also available online at www.labour.gov.sk[http://www.labour.gov.sk].</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the provincial NDP says professionals in community-based health and social services sectors are still confused about the pandemic precautions undertaken by the government.</p>
<p>"At first there didn't seem to be a plan in place at all to deal with H1N1 ... Now it would seem that every day we have new and conflicting information about vaccinations and other preparations which is causing confusion for too many people," said NDP health critic Judy Junor in a media release.</p>
<p>The NDP also wonders if the province has a plan for outbreaks in group homes or shelters since those places are overburdened by staff shortages, especially in rural areas.</p>

<p>Soccer teams across the province have red-carded an old tradition -- the post-match handshake -- because of fears it could spread the H1N1 virus among players.</p>
<p>"We're asking our members to celebrate their opposition in another way," said Sharon Marejka, executive director of the Lower Island Soccer Association, with 1,000 under-18 teams from Duncan to Sooke and Saltspring Island.</p>
<p>"We're not saying snub your opposition by not shaking their hand -- [instead] give a cheer or something at the end."</p>
<p>Soccer officials made the decision because by the end of the game, players are "pretty gnarly" with sweat and could easily transmit the virus by touching other players, said Marejka.</p>
<p>Not only will players stop shaking hands -- coaches and referees will as well, she said.</p>
<p>As the fall soccer season begins, the recommendations are being echoed by the B.C. Soccer Association, which represents 125,000 youth and adult soccer players across the province, including the Victoria Highlanders of the Premier Development League.</p>
<p>"In any regular flu season this seems to be a prudent thing to consider, and certainly under the whole H1N1 situation it's probably even more timely and important," said Bjorn Osieck, executive director.</p>
<p>Abandoning the post-match handshake underscores fears about the H1N1 virus. Sports leagues are grappling with how to handle such things as communal water bottles and towels.</p>
<p>Communities around the world are bracing for the spread of the so-called swine flu pandemic during the fall flu season. H1N1 has been linked to at least 76 deaths so far, including that of a woman from the Beecher Bay reserve.</p>
<p>Vancouver Island's minor hockey teams, which are just beginning their season, are also preparing to modify handshaking rituals, said Marg Herba, executive director of the Vancouver Island Minor Hockey Association.</p>
<p>"We have something in the works to be sent to all our minor hockey associations," said Herba. "We will probably be doing something similar, but there may be a different way of acknowledging a team."</p>
<p>But not everyone is following suit. Rugby teams aren't prepared to abandon the handshaking tradition quite yet, said Anthony Mirando, president of the Velox Valhallians Rugby Club in Victoria.</p>
<p>"Rugby is such a contact sport anyway that bodies are on bodies for 80 minutes," said Mirando. "So to try and say the handshake at the end is going to be the thing ... that passes [the flu virus], it's not practical.</p>
<p>"You don't see businessmen not shaking hands because of H1N1," he added.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the move to avoid handshakes among soccer players has been praised by medical professionals.</p>
<p>"It's symbolically reminding people we are trying to reduce the spread of the flu virus," said Richard Stanwick, the Island's chief medical health officer.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, we also want to respect good sportsmanship. Perhaps, as they do in judo and karate, a bow to the opposing team should suffice."</p>

<p>A computer keyboard that's cleaned with the wipe of a cloth across its touch-sensitive flat surface should click with customers in an increasingly germ-wary world, an Edmonton company believes.</p>
<p>CleanKeys is especially suited for hospitals, doctors' and dentists' offices, schools and other institutions where computers have multiple users, says marketing director Don McCormick.</p>
<p>Studies show that computer keyboards are a leading cause of the spread of infection in health-care facilities, says McCormick, a technology veteran who was asked to join the CleanKeys team by Randy Marsden, president of parent company Madenta.</p>
<p>The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also warned that the swine flu virus could be spread through common touch surfaces such as computer keyboards, he says.</p>
<p>"It's perfect for any environment that has contamination of some kind. It takes seconds to spray it and wipe it down, while others in the market have a rubber coating that you have to immerse in water. And they still have key crevices where all kinds of things can get trapped."</p>
<p>CleanKeys has a glass or acrylic surface, with touch-sensitive keys that give an audible click for feedback. The sensitivity can be adjusted for people wearing gloves.</p>
<p>It's already attracting interest in the U. S. and Europe only 18 months after the first prototype came out, says McCormick.</p>
<p>CleanKeys retails for $399, which McCormick says is in the middle range among similar products.</p>
<p>They expect to be able to bring the cost down in the next 12 months or so as manufacturing ramps up, he says.</p>
<p>The problem is, the company needs to grow so it can develop a marketing and distribution system, and money's not exactly growing on trees right now.</p>
<p>So it held its first investor session June 25.</p>

<p>People usually don't think of their sink as a weapon against germs. But, it just might be. Scientific evidence shows that copper kills 99% of bacteria, including super bugs like MRSA, within two hours of contact. Research also has shown that H1N1, or the swine flu virus, likewise does not survive on copper. Based on the studies and its own lab tests, the United States Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year reported that copper has anti-microbial properties, capable of killing bacteria as well as viruses. What does this all amount to? Choosing a copper sink at home. By the way, making use of copper's anti-microbial properties isn't new. Ancient Egyptians used copper to sterilize drinking water and disinfect chest wounds. The Aztecs used it to cure sore throats, while Persians chose copper to treat infections.</p>

</div><div>Bruce Campion-Smith </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Stephen Harper has survived a Liberal move to topple his minority Conservatives but suffered a withering attack over his policies and style of government.</p>
<p>Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff delivered one of his most passionate speeches Thursday as he condemned the Conservatives' "terrible record of failure" and tried to persuade voters that Harper should be dumped after almost four years in office.</p>
<p>But Harper remains in power thanks to the tacit help of the New Democrats, who abstained from the late-day vote, denying the Liberals and Bloc Quebecois the votes needed to defeat the government.</p>
<p>The non-confidence motion was defeated 144 to 117, sparing Canadians an election just a year after the last one, what would have been the fourth trip to the polls in five years.</p>
<p>There was little drama since the NDP had already signalled it would not oppose the government. Previously, the party has fought just about every initiative proposed by the Conservatives. The NDP now says it will avoid defeating the government until improvements to employment insurance are passed.</p>
<p>But the Conservatives took a bruising during a day of debate when opposition MPs lined up to take aim at the government's record and style of politics.</p>
<p>"This is a government that uses every opportunity to treat its adversaries as enemies, every opportunity to sow division for partisan gains and every opportunity to use public money to spread untruths," Ignatieff said in the Commons.</p>
<p>On issues such as the economy, climate change, swelling unemployment and Canada's position on the world stage, the government has failed Canadians, he said.</p>
<p>"The Conservatives have lost control of the public finances," Ignatieff said, citing a growing deficit he said could reach $60 billion by Christmas.</p>
<p>"All Canadians must understand that this deficit is going to hang around the necks of Canadians like a stone," he said.</p>
<p>He rattled off a list of complaints, charging that the government is more concerned with promoting its own image than getting Canadians to work or protecting them against the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>He wrapped up his speech warning that the Conservatives have a "starve-the-beast ideology" to permanently weaken the institutions of the federal government. That risks changing Canada "beyond recognition," he said.</p>
<p>"If this ideology prevails in this country it will permanently weaken the tissues that bind our society together," Ignatieff said.</p>
<p>"This is an unworthy way to govern this country, and we stand against it," he told the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Harper shrugged off the Liberal gripes and accused Ignatieff of "flailing around trying to justify an election that nobody wants for a reason nobody understands."</p>
<p>"This government has important measures before the House, tax measures to help the Canadian economy, to help homeowners and the population. It has important measures before the House to help the unemployed and help workers," Harper said.</p>
<p>Liberals are vowing they will not support the government in future confidence motions, leaving the government on uncertain ground in the months ahead.</p>
<p>The vote came on a day when a new poll showed little change in voters' preferences. The Angus Reid/Toronto Star poll showed the Conservatives at 37 per cent, Liberals at 27 per cent and the NDP at 17.</p>
<p>The poll of 1,000 Canadians was done Tuesday and Wednesday and is considered accurate within 3.1 percentage points, 19 times in 20.</p>

<div>739 words</div><div>2 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>B13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province </div>
</p>
<p>Have you heard? You should wash your hands to avoid swine flu. But there's a second part of that message you don't hear as often: Keep your hands off your face.</p>
<p>"Your hands can be laden with influenza virus, but if you're not touching your eyes, nose and lips, you are not transmitting that virus (to yourself)," says Mark Nicas, an adjunct professor of environmental health sciences at the University of California-Berkeley.</p>
<p>In other words, flu viruses do not have legs and cannot be absorbed through a finger. They will, however, ride along if that finger rubs your eye or touches your nose.</p>
<p>And, if you are a typical human, your finger will do just that -- repeatedly.</p>
<p>"It's automatic," says Richard Wenzel, an infectious-disease expert at Medical College of Virginia. "Primates apparently do it all the time."</p>
<p>To be more precise, primates who happen to be Berkeley students left alone under video surveillance do it an average of 16 times an hour. That's according to a study Nicas published in 2008.</p>
<p>Over three hours, the number of eye, nose and lip touches per student ranged from three to 104 among 10 volunteers, Nicas says. Clearly, he says, face-touching is a common though highly variable behavior. But it's little-documented. The only similar published study, he says, was a 1973 observation of 124 adults seated in crowds for 30 to 50 minutes. Even in public, researchers saw 29 episodes of outright nose-picking and 33 eye rubs, Nicas says.</p>
<p>But what's the evidence that frequent face-touchers with unclean hands get more cases of the flu? It's circumstantial, researchers concede.</p>
<p>First, they know another group of respiratory viruses called rhinoviruses can pass from hands to face. They have put those viruses on volunteers' fingers, had them rub their eyes and produced colds in the willing victims.</p>
<p>No similar studies have been done with flu viruses, partly for ethical reasons, Wenzel says: "Rhinoviruses don't kill you, but flu can."</p>
<p>Ronald Turner, a cold researcher at the University of Virginia, says hand-to-face contact may be much less important for flu. But Wenzel says flu researchers just don't know how much spread occurs hand-to-face and how much occurs when people get blasted by nearby coughs or breathe in viruses lingering in the air.</p>
<p>Wenzel, who has visited swine flu hot spots in Mexico and South America, says one unusual twist might mean the new flu is more likely to pass hand-to-face: It causes diarrhea (not a typical flu symptom) in some patients. That might mean it can infect the digestive tract through the mouth, he says.</p>
<p>Of course, that wouldn't matter if flu viruses capable of causing illness weren't lurking on doorknobs, counters and used tissues. But a 1982 study found flu viruses lived on hard surfaces for 24 to 48 hours and on soft materials for eight to 12 hours, says Manoj Jain, an infectious-disease specialist in Memphis.</p>
<p>More recently, researchers at a Mexico City hospital where early cases of H1N1 surfaced found flu viruses on patients' hands, a computer mouse, a bed rail, walls, clothes and other items in treatment rooms -- including one left empty for 72 hours and already cleaned.</p>
<p>It's not certain all those viruses could still cause illness. But the findings were described in a letter to the Journal of Hospital Infection titled "Controlling the novel A (H1N1) influenza virus: Don't touch your face!"</p>
<p>Following that advice is tough, says Alejandro Macias, director of infection control at Mexico's National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition Salvador Zubirán.</p>
<p>"I'll be talking about this in a big auditorium and look up and see people doing it," he says. "Viruses take advantage of these behaviours that are so deeply ingrained."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>PROTECT YOURSELF</p>
<p>The best way to protect yourself and others from flu is to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Other ways:</p>
<p>- Wash your hands often.</p>
<p>- Avoid touching your face.</p>
<p>- Cough into a tissue or sleeve, not your hand.</p>
<p>- Stay home when sick.</p>
<p>- Avoid close contact with sick people.</p>

<p>A New Westminster elementary school has been turned into a health hazard by B.C. government cutbacks, parents say.</p>
<p>To offset a budget deficit, the Royal City's school district laid off a number of support staff and two custodians.</p>
<p>That meant the 140 students at F.W. Howay Elementary were left without a daytime custodian and, when vomit and feces in the school washroom were tracked through the hallways last week, there was no one to clean it up, parents said.</p>
<p>"We had a daytime custodian who came in at 10 a.m. up until this year," said the school's parent advisory council chairwoman, Andra Vowles.</p>
<p>"We're just heading into this flu season and we don't really have any way to keep our kids from spreading the germs, when you've got vomit on the floor that nobody can clean up."</p>
<p>Vowles wants the daytime custodian back in the school.</p>
<p>She said parents are also concerned that cutbacks have delayed replacing the school's "disgusting" 30-year-old carpet.</p>
<p>The Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents support staff and custodians, backs the parents' complaints.</p>
<p>"There should be a day custodian at every school," said CUPE Local 49 president Marcel Marsolais.</p>
<p>"We used to have day custodians in every school, and that wasn't that long ago," said Marsolais.</p>
<p>School district assistant superintendent Al Balanuik said parents have a right to expect their children's school to be kept clean and that the district has a "fly crew" of maintenance workers on call to deal with situations like the one at Howay -- but on that day it wasn't "in a position to send anyone."</p>
<p>Marsolais said the problem at the school would be alleviated if "the provincial government funded appropriately and discontinued cutting our budget."</p>
<p>The B.C. government's cutbacks -- including the recent cancellation of this year's $110-million facilities grant to school districts -- has left numerous districts with huge budget shortfalls.</p>
<p>Cancellation of the annual facilities grant affected every school board, said Stephen Hansen, executive director of the B.C. School Trustees Association.</p>
<p>"Classrooms aren't getting their regular cleaning," said North Shore CUPE Local 389 president Cindy McQueen.</p>
<p>New Democratic Party education critic Robin Austin said: "We have finally hit a crisis. School boards can't absorb these cuts and increased operating expenses without compromising the quality of public education in British Columbia. Our children deserve better."</p>

<p>As Stephen Harper's Conservatives survived the fall's first non-confidence motion in the House of Commons by a vote of 144-117, Ottawa has become -- even more than usual -- the town where up is down and down is up.</p>
<p>Harper repeatedly says Canada should not have an election. The country doesn't need one, he says, it would interfere with economic recovery and, as the last vote was only one year ago, it's not necessary. Besides, observe pollsters for all of the parties, there is no public appetite for another vote.</p>
<p>But the one leader who would win if an election is called right now is Harper. With weakening opponents, he could get a majority government. But Harper says he doesn't want an election.</p>
<p>Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff has withdrawn all support for Harper and tried Thursday to topple the Conservative minority government, which would have forced an election. It was the Liberals' second attempt.</p>
<p>Yet Ignatieff, who comfortably slid into the Liberal leadership with such high hopes, was coming off not just a bad week but a bad one of epic proportions. To be compared in the same week to both former Tory leader Joe Clark and ex-Liberal leader John Turner is no small feat. These are names not usually included in a discussion on political success.</p>
<p>Ignatieff's week included feuding Quebec supporters, sniped comments about Toronto-centric advisers, falling polls and even a British friend commenting that Iggy, the one-time dashing English TV talk show host, has transformed into a virtually tranquilized and opinionless character.</p>
<p>To top it off, a Conservative blogger identified the bucolic woodland scene of Ignatieff's defining "Canadians can do better" TV commercial as being a downtown Toronto park.</p>
<p>If the election that Ignatieff seeks is called right now, he'd be wiped out.</p>
<p>The third party in the Commons, the Quebec-only Bloc Quebecois, says it will take matters one issue at a time -- sometimes backing Harper, other times not. In Thursday's vote, they sided with the Liberals.</p>
<p>So where does this leave the smallest party, the NDP, which has been universally anti-Harper, until now?</p>
<p>NDP Leader Jack Layton promised a few months ago to vote against a Tory budget he hadn't even read yet. But the NDP recently flip-flopped, saying it would support Harper. And considering the amount of ideological real estate separating the Conservatives and NDP, they are remarkable roommates.</p>
<p>In Thursday's non-confidence vote, though, the NDP did not support Harper, merely choosing to abstain from voting, which is a "kinda, sorta" type of support that allows the NDP to say it didn't actually vote with Harper.</p>
<p>Unlike minority governments where natural alignments can be found, this one is more about posturing, opportunity and expediency, all with an eye to political survival. And that's not a prescription bound to last.</p>

<p>Amid the increasing hysteria over H1N1 flu preparations, Canada's Olympic Committee is ratcheting things up a notch. In this winter's Olympics in Vancouver, gone will be handshakes, high fives, cheek kissing and even the "air kiss" and hug thing that people do when they don't really want to kiss.</p>
<p>It's all in the name of avoiding the flu virus, which is being taken to rather extreme lengths.</p>
<p>H1N1, like any other flu, is spread by coming into contact with respiratory droplets and then rubbing your nose, eyes or mouth. This is why sensible people get vaccinated, wash their hands regularly, cough or sneeze into their sleeve and don't rub their face.</p>
<p>And it's smart to stay home while sick.</p>
<p>So exactly what can the new "no contact" Olympic athletes safely do? Apparently they are allowed to fist bump, although no one has really explained why virus hysteria over a handshake would be any better by bumping knuckles and the back of hands.</p>
<p>More than a flu epidemic, let's hope for an outbreak of some common sense.</p>

</p>
<p>Montreal mothers set a world record last year for simultaneous breastfeeding at one site - 560 tiny mouths "latched on."</p>
<p>But because of swine flu risks, Montreal public health officials cancelled this year's Breastfeeding Challenge, which had been scheduled for the Palais des congrès.</p>
<p>The popular event would have pit the Montreal gathering against other cities around the world, each vying for the greatest turnout.</p>
<p>Undeterred by threats of H1N1 virus, hardcore breastfeeder Emma Kwasnica, who is two weeks overdue with her third child, is calling on all breastfeeding women and their babies to show up tomorrow at a tiny park near her home in St. Laurent.</p>
<p>"I feel they've missed the boat on breastfeeding," she said of the Montreal public health department, which is not overseeing the event.</p>
<p>The irony, she noted, is that it is precisely the lack of breast milk - with its built-in antibodies - that puts children at risk of contracting disease.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2001 by the Quintessence Foundation, the event aims to raise awareness about the benefits of breastfeeding.</p>
<p>"Any woman I've spoken to that has been to the challenge ends up breastfeeding longer. ... Ultimately, that benefits babies," Kwasnica said.</p>
<p>"And if they're not coming to the big event we have every year, that means less breast milk for less babies for less time.</p>
<p>"That's the tragedy for me, and why we've got to do this."</p>
<p>Montreal has held the breastfeeding record for three years running, she added.</p>
<p>The cancellation is a precautionary measure, explained Dr. Terry-Nan Tannenbaum, interim director of Montreal's department of public health.</p>
<p>"Babies under 6 months are too young to vaccinate and are therefore in the high-risk group," she said.</p>
<p>Despite no new cases of H1N1 declared in Montreal, there was concern that hundreds of women congregating with their newborns and toddlers under one roof would be at risk for swine flu exposure, Tannenbaum said.</p>
<p>"Obviously, we promote breastfeeding but it's not something we can recommend at this time," she said.</p>
<p>Events at four other Quebec sites have also been cancelled.</p>
<p>It's important to encourage mothers to breastfeed so their children continue to receive vital immunities, said Julie Snyder, a spokesperson for World Breastfeeding Week.</p>
<p>"It's the best way to fight H1N1," she said. "Our only weapon to protect babies is to breastfeed them."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tories want to extend parental benefits to self-employed; New EI legislation gives NDP another reason to support Conservatives after Liberals fail to topple minority government</b>
</div><div>BILL CURRY </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The Conservative government will introduce new rules this fall that extend parental benefits to the swelling ranks of self-employed Canadians, many of whom have complained they cannot afford to have children and run businesses at the same time.</p>
<p>Sources say the government's second piece of employment insurance legislation will be introduced before Parliament's Christmas break. The bill would have a direct impact on the truck drivers, real-estate agents, hairdressers and other workers making up the growing ranks of self-employed Canadians, who now number more than 2.7 million people.</p>
<p>The NDP has for years called for changes to the system that would allow self-employed Canadians to take time off to care for their infant children. New Brunswick MP Yvon Godin, the NDP's critic for EI issues, said many self-employed Canadians have told him they simply can't afford to have children because of the current rules.</p>
<p>“This is very important,” he said. “Those people, I think, deserve to be treated the same as any Canadian. … We want the bill now.”</p>
<p>The bill could also have a direct impact on the stability of the Conservative government by effectively giving the NDP a second reason to support the Tories and avoid an election.</p>
<p>The NDP is currently the only party keeping the government in power.</p>
<p>The party's primary stated reason for doing so is to ensure the passage of government legislation introduced last month that extends EI benefits for long-tenured workers.</p>
<p>However, that bill is moving quickly through the House of Commons and could become law in a matter of weeks, robbing the NDP of its main reason for avoiding a federal election.</p>
<p>Officials say this second bill will be introduced some time after Thanksgiving and before Christmas, giving the NDP another opportunity to push its EI agenda. Conservatives insist the bill's potential appeal to the NDP is a “secondary” consideration for them, given that the extension of benefits was already part of the party's platform in the last election campaign.</p>
<p>Government officials also say Prime Minister Stephen Harper wants to keep governing and will not deliberately sabotage the fragile arrangement keeping the Conservatives in power.</p>
<p>“We won't be doing anything that is blatantly aimed at forcing the opposition parties to vote against us,” said one senior government official yesterday.</p>
<p>Late yesterday, a Liberal motion of no confidence in the government was defeated 144 to 117, thanks to a mass abstention by the NDP caucus.</p>
<p>Mr. Godin, who is also the NDP Whip, rose in the House afterward to say the abstentions were on behalf of unemployed Canadians and were not a show of support for the Conservative government. NDP Leader Jack Layton later said his party would go forward on a case-by-case basis and called for an end to the political “brinkmanship.”</p>
<p>In June, the Prime Minister said he was willing to work with the Liberals on a “very major design change” related to EI and the self-employed; however, that two-party working group fell apart over the summer.</p>
<p>Earlier yesterday, Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff delivered a speech outlining the reasons why his party moved the motion of no confidence. He said the Conservatives have lost control of the nation's finances, are failing to protect Canadians abroad, are not doing enough on climate change, have been too slow to secure an H1N1 vaccine and are undermining the role of the federal government.</p>
<p>“These are the kinds of failings that have made us, week after week, month after month, not just over the last year, over four long years, come to the conclusion that we cannot continue to support the government,” Mr. Ignatieff said. “Is this a pattern of incompetence or is this a pattern of malice? It is a little of both.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Stats in on effect of downturn; Food Bank use up, jobless stress growing, report reveals</b>
</div><div>Richard Warnica   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>562 words</div><div>2 October 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Early</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>The global economic downturn has chiselled away at the foundations of Edmonton's boom-time growth, with a new report suggesting a host of economic and poverty measures in the city will fall this year to levels not seen since the late 1990s.</p>
<p>A report prepared by the Edmonton Social Planning Council projects unemployment in greater Edmonton will climb to seven per cent this year, the highest rate in the city since 1996, and almost double the 2008 rate of 3.7 per cent.</p>
<p>Food Bank use, too, is expected to to soar, with more than 180,000 individuals projected to seek help from the organization before the end of the year. That's up from 129,000 in 2008, and would be the highest number the food bank has served since 1999.</p>
<p>Tamisan Bencz-Knight, a spokeswoman for the Edmonton Food Bank, said the increase in demand has been dramatic over the past nine months. "It has stretched volunteers, donors and staff," Bencz-Knight said. "But the people who can donate are still donating."</p>
<p>Bencz-Knight said the organization's phone lines have been swamped, often with clients who've never had to use the food bank before. "It's a stressful time," she said.</p>
<p>The soaring unemployment rate has also been accompanied by a rise in the number of those seeking government benefits.</p>
<p>Based on the first six months of the year, almost 14,000 people in greater Edmonton are expected to apply for employment insurance in 2009. That's more than double the slightly more than 5,000 who applied in 2008.</p>
<p>Thousands more Edmontonians are also expected to seek provincial benefits through Alberta Works this year compared to last.</p>
<p>John Kolkman, who co-wrote the report for the agency, said the new numbers represent a drop from the heights of the boom, when even many of the poor had jobs.</p>
<p>"Prior to the downturn last fall, just about everybody of low income was working," he said. The real question for those people, he said, is what happens when their EI benefits run out, especially with the provincial government mired in deficit.</p>
<p>"They've been working," he said. "And the very time they need some help to get through a rough patch, government is looking at cutting back."</p>
<p>The Social Planning Council Report, titled Tracking the Trends, is available through the organization's website. It features detailed breakdowns on demographics, education, employment, wages, income and poverty in the Edmonton Census Metropolitan Area.</p>
<p>And while the major trends may seem not great, the report is not all bad news, said Kolkman. According to their analysis, Alberta's young people are better educated than ever, with fewer dropping out of high school and more going on to college or university, but many are having trouble finding work in their fields, Kolkman said. The report should signal to government that social spending should stay high through the downturn. "You have to see some of these as investments," he said. "If you don't make them now, you're really not saving money, certainly not in the long term."</p>

<p>The World Health Organization says H1N1 could eventually infect two billion people.</p>
<p>The U. S. Centers for Disease Control says 36,000 people die from the flu each year. Other reports claim that there have been only 311 deaths out of 70,893 H1N1 cases worldwide.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical companies, who stand to rake in billions of dollars, and public health officials have built up this pending pandemic. There's a lot of money involved and influence and careers and entire institutions are involved.</p>
<p>Health Canada says vaccinations are expected to start in November. Some parents are not impressed by the long list of professionals who approve the new vaccine production. They are fully aware of the victims of the thalidomide vaccine, which was intended to prevent morning sickness in pregnant women.</p>

<p>With an H1N1 flu outbreak imminent, I have a suggestion for schools, amateur sport organizations and public health officials.</p>
<p>Not once in all the H1N1 news has there been mention of a formalized program requiring basketballs, volleyballs and the like to be washed and sterilized prior to play, and all players being required (under adult supervision) to use disinfectant hand lotion prior to play.</p>
<p>Balls are touched by large numbers of kids who all sweat, sneeze, cough and rub various parts of their skin in the process of gym classes or games. Talk about a flu-stew on the balls' surface!</p>
<p>Recently, I attended a basketball event that drew young men and women from all over Alberta. There's no doubt in my mind that if one kid had the flu but wasn't showing it quite yet, or was hiding the early symptoms, he or she could easily have passed it via the ball to many others across the province.</p>
<p>I'm not a clean-freak. After the flu scare passes, let's return to just telling kids to wash their hands. But for now, I suggest we need some rules, and quickly.</p>

<p>A s Calgary homeless shelters stockpile supplies for cold and flu season, local officials are preparing to meet with the province Monday to deal with any outstanding concerns about the pandemic response plan.</p>
<p>Two departments--Alberta Health Services, and Alberta Housing and Urban Affairs--will be meeting with shelter operators to come up with a plan for a potential H1N1 outbreak, which some have suggested could include measures such as closing shelter doors or locking people inside.</p>
<p>"Each of the shelters is doing some of their own planning," said Calgary Homeless Foundation president Tim Richter, noting his organization is working with the province to deal with the overall plan.</p>
<p>Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services, said the province has been trying to identify the issues faced by homeless shelters.</p>
<p>One shelter, the Mustard Seed Street Ministry, has already put out a public plea for tissues and hand sanitizer.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Washing hands won't stop spread of flu, study says</b>
</div><div>Gerry Bellett   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>511 words</div><div>2 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>As concerned health authorities worry about what this winter's flu season has in store, a controversial Canadian study argues that frequent hand washing will not prevent the spread of influenza among health care workers.</p>
<p>The study by the Council of Canadian Academies was done for the Public Health Agency of Canada and recommended respirator-type masks should be used as the "final layer of protection" for health care workers.</p>
<p>However, its findings weren't adopted by the agency.</p>
<p>According to an article published Thursday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal concerning the two-year-old study, the public health agency continues to recommend hand washing as the primary preventive measure to avoid flu transmission.</p>
<p>The article also says the health agency contends that improper use of respirator masks "may in fact increase the risk of infection."</p>
<p>A check of the health agency's website shows that it recommends masks only for people who are infected with the flu virus and who decide to go out in public.</p>
<p>The medical journal quotes Dr. Donald Low, microbiologist-in-chief at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, as saying that research on the transmission of influenza was limited, so the argument that it would prevent the spread of flu was not evidence-based.</p>
<p>The health agency said a protective respirator-type mask won't protect against infection if it is worn for an extended period and if removed incorrectly could spread the virus to hands and face.</p>
<p>So where does all this leave Canadians worried about how to protect themselves against the H1N1 swine flu virus?</p>
<p>Since the swine flu scare began earlier this year, hand wash dispensers containing germ-killing gel have appeared in the lobbies of many large public buildings and some Canadians have taken to carrying around small containers of hand wash in an effort to keep the flu bug at bay.</p>
<p>Dr. Bonnie Henry, director of Public Health Emergency Management at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, and author of the book, Soap and Water & Common Sense, said Thursday she disagrees with the questions about the value of hand washing.</p>
<p>She noted the 2007 study was done in regard to the transmission of flu among health care workers, not the general public.</p>
<p>"The focus was on health care workers getting sick and whether they should be wearing masks or respirators in hospitals. Two weeks ago, a study was released showing that an increased focus on hand washing in hospitals reduced the absenteeism rate from respiratory infections of health care workers," said Henry.</p>
<p>"The fact is we don't know how influenza is transmitted but we know hand washing is important in stopping the spread of colds and other respiratory diseases and will have some effect on spreading influenza," she said.</p>
<p>"Washing your hands is common sense. It does work. It protects you and your family and keeps you healthy."</p>

<p>Because of swine flu risks, Montreal public health officials have cancelled this year's Breastfeeding Challenge. Originally scheduled for Saturday, it would have pitted Montreal against other cities around the world, each vying for the greatest turnout. Montreal has held the championship for three years running. The event, first held in 2001, aims to raise awareness about the benefits of breastfeeding. The cancellation is a precautionary measure, said Dr. Terry-Nan Tannenbaum. "Babies under six months are too young to vaccinate and are therefore in the high-risk group," she said. There was concern that hundreds of women with their newborns and toddlers would be at risk for swine flu exposure, Tannenbaum said.</p>

<p>Can we afford light rail?</p>
<p>In his Innercity podcast, Ken Gray talks with city community and protective services committee chairwoman Diane Deans about the new $1.9-billion light-rail plan. The Gloucester-Southgate ward councillor says city council might be forced to delay building the downtown tunnel in the plan for up to 30 years because the cost of rail will plunge Ottawa too deeply into debt.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No growth for Guelph Police next year</b>

</p>
<p>The Guelph Police operating budget for 2010 will expand by 5.94 per cent, but that increase won't result in more officers on the beat or new enforcement programs.</p>
<p>Police Chief Rob Davis said the public needn't worry about the level of law enforcement in the city.</p>
<p>Despite budgetary restraints, enforcement will be maintained at present levels, he said.</p>
<p>But a spike in crime or community emergencies could strain the service's limited resources, a police official acknowledged.</p>
<p>"I think the directive from the city has been pretty clear: Do what you can to keep it as low as you can," Davis said Thursday after the Guelph Police Services Board passed a $30.8 million operating budget.</p>
<p>The 5.95 per cent ($1.727 million) hike primarily reflects unavoidable increases in expenditures like salary, pay-equity and employee benefits.</p>
<p>Projects covered under the police service's capital budgets, such as improvements to the fleet of vehicles and renovations to its downtown headquarters, will be put off for now as a cost-saving measure.</p>
<p>"We always have growth in our operating budget, through things like staff increases," said Shelagh Morris, director of corporate services for Guelph Police. "In the eight years that I've been here, this is the first year that we have not had a program increase or a staff increase. We are just maintaining the status quo."</p>
<p>The budget will have to be carefully monitored throughout the year to make sure spending is kept in check, she added. But costs such as overtime expenses can be difficult to control, and will depend on what's in store in terms of crime in the city.</p>
<p>"Knock on wood, we don't get a bad year, meaning we don't get a lot of serious crime, or a major crime," Morris said, adding the H1N1 flu pandemic could potentially require increased police response in the community.</p>
<p>"I don't foresee that we are going to be in dire straits or anything like that," she said.</p>
<p>Constrained by directives from a revenue-challenged City of Guelph, Guelph Police was asked to try to flatline its budget for 2010. The city is facing a $2.7 million revenue shortfall this year.</p>
<p>"We have certainly done what we can to keep it at last year's level," Davis said.</p>
<p>"There's not much you can do with the salaries, and they are the biggest chunk of your budget."</p>
<p>Davis stressed that there has not been a cut to resources. While economic times are tough, he does not expect a spike in crime rates as a result.</p>
<p>"We are maintaining the current level," Davis said. "We may see a slight increase in the crime and in response times over the next year, simply because we are not keeping up with the pace of population growth this year. But I am not expecting things to turn significantly bad."</p>
<p>Guelph is a consistently safe community, Davis added, and there is a good relationship between the police and Guelph citizens, which contributes to keeping crime rates down.</p>
<p>"The public does not have to worry at this point about loss of services, longer response times or a large spike in crime," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Prenatal exposure to 1918 flu increased heart disease risk as an adult, study says</b>
</div><div>Sheryl Ubelacker   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>806 words</div><div>2 October 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>C2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>TORONTO - Adults who were exposed in utero to the H1N1 influenza virus of 1918 were significantly more likely to have cardiovascular disease later in life, a U.S. study has found.</p>
<p>The study, published Thursday in the Journal of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease, also found that men exposed prenatally to the Spanish flu strain were shorter than peers born months before or months after the 1918 pandemic.</p>
<p>"If you were in utero during the flu, if you were in that birth cohort, you were as a male a little shorter at World War II enlistment," said senior author Caleb Finch, a professor of gerontology and neurobiology at the University of Southern California.</p>
<p>"And then 60 years after you were born, you had a higher risk of heart disease," Finch said in an interview Wednesday from Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The findings, taken along with previous research, raise questions about possible effects on offspring exposed in utero to the current pandemic H1N1 flu, a different strain than the one that killed tens of millions worldwide at the close of the First World War.</p>
<p>"Our point is that during pregnancy, even mild sickness from flu could affect development with longer consequences," Finch said.</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed data from the 1982-1996 National Health Interview Surveys, which included 100,000 individuals, aged 63 to 78, born during and around the time of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic.</p>
<p>After first appearing in spring 1918 and all but disappearing in the summer, the flu pandemic "resurged to an unprecedentedly virulent October-December peak," the researchers write. The outbreak killed two per cent of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>They found that men born in the first few months of 1919 (the height of the pandemic occurred when their mothers were in their second or third trimester) had a 23.1 per cent greater chance of having heart disease after age 60 than the overall population.</p>
<p>Women born in the first few months of 1919 were not significantly more likely to have cardiovascular disease, suggesting possible sex differences in the effects from flu exposure.</p>
<p>However, females born in the second quarter of 1919 - first trimester during the height of the epidemic - were 17 per cent more likely to have heart disease than the general population in later life, the researchers found.</p>
<p>The researchers also examined the heights of 2.7 million men born between 1915 and 1922 at the time of Second World War enlistment. They found that average height among men increased every successive year except for the period coinciding with in-utero exposure to the flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Men who were exposed to the 1918 strain in the womb were slightly shorter on average than those born just a year earlier or a year later. In their analysis, the researchers controlled for known season-of-birth effects and maternal malnutrition.</p>
<p>Still, Finch was careful about extrapolating conclusions from the data to the current H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>"All we can say is here's an example of such an effect," he said. "The current H1N1 is a different H1N1. And although there have been increased numbers of secondary infections and mortality in pregnant women, there has not been any evidence of the terrible secondary infections that were part of the 1918 flu.</p>
<p>"That was off the scale."</p>
<p>Dr. Tina Chambers, a specialist in perinatal epidemiology at the University of California at San Diego, said the findings appear consistent with the fetal origins theory.</p>
<p>"In 1918, we know that just like now, pregnant women seemed to be more likely to have complications of the flu," Chambers said by email. "Influenza in pregnancy has been linked to maternal complications such as serious respiratory problems, which could affect the fetus . . . High fever very early in pregnancy can increase the risk of certain birth defects, and fever at other times may also pose a risk to the fetus."</p>
<p>She said the findings make sense "if you accept that prenatal growth restriction, or other prenatal events, can predispose individuals to adult diseases."</p>
<p>Chambers said it highlights the importance for pregnant women to protect themselves by getting the H1N1 flu vaccination; treating fever with acetaminophen; and seeing their doctor immediately if they experience "flu-like symptoms or think they have been exposed so that antiviral medication can be initiated."</p>
<p>Finch agreed that women should try to avoid getting any kind of infection during pregnancy - especially flu - but he would not comment on whether women should be advised to avoid getting pregnant during the pandemic.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't know how to put such a statement and wouldn't want to imply that we are thinking of that," he said. "It's just a question that can't be answered."</p>

</div><div>Vik Kirsch   </div>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Good guidance begins at the top of an organization, provincial Minister of Health David Caplan told reporters in Guelph Thursday in answer to why some hospitals are eliminating annual deficits while others remain in the red.</p>
<p>"Oftentimes, it's a question of leadership," Caplan said while touring Guelph General Hospital.</p>
<p>He added while some hospitals face unique circumstances dating back years, others continue to struggle with inefficiency, such as serving the wrong patients at the wrong time and place.</p>
<p>Guelph General Hospital plans to eliminate a deficit of $189,000 by the end of the fiscal year next March, while nearby Cambridge Memorial Hospital faces a projected $5-million shortfall and has been taken over by a provincial supervisor.</p>
<p>"Quality," the minister continued, "begins with a balanced budget."</p>
<p>He was impressed, he said, by the Guelph acute care hospital's operation, including redevelopment of its emergency department to quickly streamline patient registration, assessment and treatment through a new "see and treat" system.</p>
<p>Thursday, the ministry added a surgical safety checklist to eight patient safety indicators hospitals must make public on a regular basis, like the in-hospital rates of some common contagious infections.</p>
<p>The new indicator relates to common tasks and surgical items in operating rooms.</p>
<p>Caplan said he wanted meaningful insight into surgical practice with the new indicator.</p>
<p>"When you measure it, you can improve it."</p>
<p>Responding to public confusion about the danger Ontarians face from H1N1 flu, for which Guelph General Hospital has been preparing for months, Caplan said: "I think we need to be appropriately vigilant."</p>
<p>Recent H1N1 outbreaks in the southern hemisphere have been slightly worse than seasonal flu, Caplan said.</p>
<p>"It's why we have a heightened state of alert."</p>
<p>Caplan and Guelph MPP Liz Sandals toured the hospital's emergency department, including a new emergency mental health unit there, which he said was impressive. He stopped briefly to chat with Erin Kemp, a University of Guelph tourism management student, who was there to be examined for pain inher calves.</p>
<p>"They'll figure it out, don't worry," Caplan assured her. "The folks here are incredibly well trained.'</p>
<p>Kemp was pleased with the efficiency of the "see and treat" system, which provided timely care. "They said it would just be a little wait," she said.</p>
<p>Hospital emergency room services director Jan McCormick told Caplan redevelopment has allowed her staff to reduce average wait times by 158 minutes, a 60 per cent drop, since August.</p>
<p>"That's fantastic," Caplan responded, noting that should make the public happy.</p>
<p>Sandals said "see and treat" at the hospital demonstrates to other hospitals what can be achieved.</p>
<p>"This hospital has been good at taking a leadership position," Sandals said.</p>
<p>"It's all about quality improvements," the minister continued. "It's the patients who are benefitting."</p>
<p>"That's why we see ‘see and treat' as the right approach," emergency department chief Dr. Ray Gaiardo said.</p>
<p>The effort dovetails with the Health Ministry's goal of reducing hospital wait times across Ontario, Caplan said.</p>
<p>"We still have some more work to do, but it's incredibly encouraging, isn't it?" he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ontario minister urges Ottawa to speed up flu-vaccine approval</b>
</div><div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>442 words</div><div>2 October 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Ontario Health Minister David Caplan urged Ottawa on Thursday to speed up approval of the H1N1 vaccine amid concerns that a second wave of the H1N1 flu may have already arrived in the province.</p>
<p>Ontario is equipped to deploy the vaccine quickly, but the province can't get it until Health Canada issues a licence to the manufacturer, Caplan said.</p>
<p>Production of the vaccine by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> in Ste-Foy, Que., is largely complete, he said.</p>
<p>The federal government wants to make sure the flu shots are safe and effective and, as a result, Caplan said it could take three weeks just to get the necessary approvals in place.</p>
<p>"I'm urging the federal government to show some leadership and, as we're seeing in the United States, expedite the approval process so that we can get (the vaccine) deployed as quickly as we possibly can," he said.</p>
<p>"But unfortunately, that's beyond the control of provincial governments."</p>
<p>A resurgence of the H1N1 flu is expected this fall, but Ontario officials don't yet know for sure whether it has already arrived.</p>
<p>Other parts of the world have seen several waves of the H1N1, so provincial officials are closely monitoring the situation here, Caplan said.</p>
<p>"Of course we won't know until actual testing, or there is evidence of it," he said.</p>
<p>Caplan's comments come after a published report quoted a senior Ontario health official as saying the second wave may be here.</p>
<p>Dr. Donald Low, head of the public health laboratories with the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, said a number of flu cases have come to emergency departments over the last few days.</p>
<p>The flu activity is concentrated primarily in Toronto, Hamilton and London, said Low, who is also chief microbiologist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>He said there have been few cases of H1N1 in Ontario over the last few weeks, but on Monday, six new cases were confirmed.</p>
<p>Provincial labs have seen a sharp increase in influenza A cases and further testing is expected to determine that they are the H1N1 strain, Low said.</p>
<p>David Jensen, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, wouldn't confirm Low's figures. An updated list of flu activity in the province will be available Friday, he said.</p>
<p>Neither Low nor Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, were available for comment.</p>
<p>Dr. Barbara Yaffe, director of communicable disease control and associate medical officer of health for Toronto Public Health, told CTV News that Toronto had three confirmed cases this week.</p>

<p>1918 H1N1 flu virus had lifelong affects</p>
<p>A U.S. study has found that adults who were exposed while in the womb to the H1N1 flu virus of 1918 were much more likely to have cardiovascular disease later in life.</p>
<p>It also found that men exposed prenatally to the Spanish flu strain were shorter than peers born months before or months after the 1918 pandemic.</p>
<p>The findings, taken with previous research, raise questions about possible effects on offspring exposed prenatally to the current pandemic swine flu -- though it's a different strain than the one that killed millions 90 years ago.</p>
<p>Last year's flu shot won't increase H1N1 risk</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada says preliminary data show there is no link between having a severe bout of pandemic flu and having had a seasonal flu shot last year. The agency is responding to a Canadian study that appears to show that getting a flu shot last year doubled a person's risk of catching the new H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The head of the agency, Dr. David Butler-Jones, says experts are still studying why the study suggests this link, but he cautions that the findings may not be real.</p>
<p>New treatment for oxygen-deprived babies</p>
<p>Lowering the body temperature of oxygen-deprived newborns reduces the risk for neurological problems later in life.</p>
<p>A new study says the strategy didn't reduce the risk of death or severe disability -- but will still help fill a crucial gap in the effort to treat babies who have brain damage due to hypoxia, or lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>Babies in the cooled group had a 57 per cent increased chance of surviving without neurological damage. This included a 33 per cent decreased risk of cerebral palsy.</p>
<p>Scientists are collecting data on how lowering body temperatures might help newborns when blood-deprivation to the brain results in the death of brain cells, possibly leading to cerebral palsy or mental retardation.</p>

<p>Conflicting medical evidence has created mass confusion over the best way to protect yourself from pandemic flu.</p>
<p>Medical journals reported yesterday there's no evidence handwashing works and N95 respirators may be no better than paper surgical masks at protecting health-care workers from flu.</p>
<p>"I think it really tells us what a long way we have to go to really understand how this virus is transmitted and how best to protect individuals," said Dr. Donald Low, microbiologist-in-chief at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>"There is such a dire need for research in this area."</p>
<p>"This is an important cause of illness every year. There is so much we don't understand about it and this is really where we've got to put our energies in research in answering some of these basic questions."</p>
<p>Experts can't even agree if the second wave of H1N1 has started in Ontario. Outbreaks at St. Mark Catholic Elementary School in Stoney Creek and Columbia International College held steady or improved yesterday. Halton reported its first two confirmed cases of H1N1 this fall -- both in adults.</p>
<p>Low says H1N1 has also been evident in Toronto and London, but provincial Health Minister David Caplan says tests have yet to confirm the pandemic is back.</p>
<p>"Whether the actual wave is here we can argue about that, but the fact is that there is H1N1 out there in the community," Low says, "so we have to be prepared."</p>
<p>But the best way to prepare has been called into question by two prominent medical journals.</p>
<p>The Canadian Medical Assoc- iation Journal revealed there is no evidence handwashing stops the spread of flu, citing a report Low headed that was commissioned by the Public Health Agency of Canada two years ago.</p>
<p>"There is no direct evidence that handwashing affects flu transmission," said Dr. Michael Gardam, a researcher for Toronto's University Health Network, who was involved in this report and another one for The Lancet three years ago. "We reviewed all of the literature going back to the 1930s and there's nothing. That doesn't mean it doesn't work. It just means there's no evidence."</p>
<p>Both Low and Gardam still recommend handwashing as protection against the flu.</p>
<p>"Handwashing is never a bad thing, it's easy to do and it works in general for respiratory illness, so in my mind it's reasonable to recommend it," Gardam said. "I do stop short of saying it is the most effective way of controlling flu which some places have done. That's going too far because frankly I don't know that that's true."</p>
<p>The other shocker yesterday was a study by McMaster University's Dr. Mark Loeb showing N95 respirators are no better at protecting health-care workers against the flu than surgical masks, which aren't fitted and are a fraction of the cost, as low as 11 cents each, compared to as much as 80 cents for the respirators.</p>
<p>"There's been controversy whether the surgical masks are as good as the N95 respirators, so basically we did a head-to-head comparison," Loeb said. "The importance of this is that the N95 respirator is less available and more costly than the surgical masks."</p>
<p>The Hamilton research was published online by the Journal of the American Medical Association yesterday because it was felt to be of too much public importance to wait until the Nov. 4 print edition.</p>
<p>It's already creating debate in the medical community because its results are opposite an unpublished study presented last month at an international infectious diseases conference. Australian researcher Raina MacIntyre studied 2,000 hospital workers in Beijing and concluded the N95 mask reduced the risk of respiratory illness by 60 per cent and the risk of flu by 75 per cent.</p>
<p>"The one in China shocked me by the difference," Gardam said. "I really want to see how they analyzed it. I really want to understand because it doesn't make sense to me."</p>
<p>Loeb, whose study has been widely praised by Ontario's leading infectious disease experts and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, randomly assigned 225 nurses surgical masks and 221 the fitted N95 respirators while they were caring for patients with fever and respiratory illness at eight Ontario hospitals including Hamilton General, Henderson General, McMaster University Medical Centre, St. Joseph's Healthcare and Joseph Brant Memorial.</p>
<p>However, the Australian researcher pointed out it didn't compare the results to nurses wearing no masks.</p>
<p>"They did not test any control group to compare what the rate of flu infection was in a group not wearing any mask, so the study cannot determine whether either arm in their study actually had any efficacy," MacIntyre said.</p>
<p>The ONA wants hospitals to err on the side of caution and continue using the N95 masks until more evidence is available.</p>
<p>Infectious disease experts say more time and research is needed for clear answers on H1N1.</p>
<p>"What the public should know is that these are pieces of a puzzle and that all of the available information has to be considered when groups are making these types of recommendations," said Dr. Arjun Srinivasa, medical epidemiologist at CDC. "No one single study provides the answer to any of these questions."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 season drawing to a close Down Under -</b>
</div><div>Michael Madigan   </div>

<p>As Canada enters its first winter under the threat of H1N1 flu, it might take some comfort from Australia's experience.</p>
<p>The land Down Under survived the experience during its winter just ending, even if it emerged a little bruised and battered.</p>
<p>More than 170 died, including 10 kids aged under 15. Most worryingly, many of the victims were healthy individuals with no underlying condition to contribute to their deaths.</p>
<p>There is also widespread concern the flu may have slipped under the statistical radar, exacerbating existing conditions in patients which led to deaths not officially recorded as swine flu related.</p>
<p>But while many of the estimated 5,000 people hospitalized with the disease are still recovering, it wasn't quite the apocalypse we had feared.</p>
<p>When the World Health Organization declared swine flu a global pandemic in June, many Australians shuddered with the realization we'd be the first to deal with the new disease in the cold months.</p>
<p>While Canadians may smile at what we class as "winter," conditions can get chilly for millions of Australians mid-year, particularly those living in southern centres such as Melbourne or the national capital of Canberra.</p>
<p>In the sunny northern state of Queensland, the state's chief health officer warned people should stockpile supplies to avoid spreading infection in public places.</p>
<p>But the black plague predictions were far off the mark as the flu appeared to hit no harder than other severe strains have in the past.</p>
<p>In the hardest hit state of Victoria, around 85 per cent of swine flu patients listed as critically ill survived while staying an average of about nine days in intensive care units.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, last Wednesday, just as reports of the disease began to decline, public interest was falling away and pre-summer temperatures were soaring, Australia began its biggest ever vaccination program to combat the flu.</p>
<p>Health authorities fear that in an increasingly borderless world the flu might take hold in the northern winter and spark a resurgence across Australia.</p>
<p>Australia's chief medical officer, Jim Bishop, says Australia's warm summer sunshine, while a proven disinfectant, won't change the nature of a clearly dangerous disease which will remain a threat for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The federal government is urging every Australian over the age of nine to get a jab for swine flu, buying 21 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine to ensure there's enough to go round.</p>
<p>Health Minister Nicola Roxon said the government would have sufficient doses for all adults to have the vaccination.</p>
<p>"It's important for those in the risk groups and who are most vulnerable to do so with more haste," Roxon said.</p>
<p>"We are also trying to provide protection across the community so that if this disease has a tail beyond the flu season, if it comes back for the next flu season, that we have enough ... a high enough proportion of our population vaccinated that the spread within the community will be slowed."</p>
<p>The upside of the flu was the creation of a mini-investment boom in health as government coffers opened to those trying to come up with new ways of fighting deadly disease.</p>
<p>The elderly also found that while they're not immune from the threat, a lifetime of building up resistance to infections seems to have given them an edge.</p>
<p>Australia also learned some valuable lessons about what turned out to be a slow and, at times, inflexible bureaucracy, quickly recognizing the need for some sharpening up if we are to deal properly with a more serious outbreak.</p>
<p>A national containment strategy didn't work well, with up to 1,800 cruise ship passengers able to go home despite a couple of fellow passengers being diagnosed with the disease earlier in the year.</p>
<p>The nation's general practitioners, who were at the frontline in the fight against the disease (those afflicted usually turned up first at the family doctor), were also left out of the loop.</p>
<p>Basic supplies of surgical masks, gowns and gloves for the local doctor were scarce.</p>
<p>This week's vaccinations have tested public acceptance of inoculations as parents are advised not to allow their under tens to accept the needle until a more acceptable inoculation for the young is available, hopefully before the end of the year.</p>
<p>There are also groups raising general concerns about vaccination, particularly on websites, alleging the swine flu vaccination has not been subjected to enough research and testing.</p>
<p>But the majority of Australians appear more than willing to roll their sleeves up and accept a jab, trusting science to help keep at bay what could still be a lethal threat.</p>

<p>Most American workers say they have not had any direction from their employers regarding the upcoming flu season and continue to feel pressure to show up for work when sick because of the current economic environment, a new survey found.</p>
<p>The survey of 1,028 U.S. office workers by Mansfield Communications found that 69 per cent of respondents said they have received no communication about policies in the workplace relating to the H1N1 virus, including information about hand-washing or sick leave. And 84 per cent said they believe the current economic slump creates more pressure to show up for work - even if they are feeling sick.</p>
<p>While 80 per cent said they felt knowledgeable about precautions that should be taken if the virus reached their workplace, 51 per cent said they don't plan to get a flu vaccination this fall. And 47 per cent said that they would still engage in public activities such as riding the bus and grocery shopping even if they were infected and required to stay home because of a company-imposed quarantine.</p>
