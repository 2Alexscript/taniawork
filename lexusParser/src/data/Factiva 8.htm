<p>Canada is lending 5 million doses from its H1N1 flu vaccine stockpile to Mexico, the federal government announced yesterday.</p>
<p>Shipments will start heading south by the end of this week, but they are not being sent as a donation, federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said in a statement.</p>
<p>Mexico has bought H1N1 vaccine for its population, but most of its order won't be filled by the manufacturers until the end of the month.</p>
<p>Canada started its vaccination program in October and has millions of doses of unused vaccine in storage because demand for the shot did not keep up with supply.</p>
<p>The provincial and territorial governments agreed unanimously to the Mexican government's request for 5 million doses, according to the health minister's statement.</p>
<p>Mexico is to replenish what it takes from Canada's supply by March 31.</p>
<p>Canada ordered 50.4 million doses of the vaccine from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> this summer and bought 200,000 doses from Australia. Canada is poised to have more than 20 million unused doses at the end of this flu season in April.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Baby Julian's grandmother cradled him for a last, loving hug before it was time to say goodbye.</p>
<p>"She handed him to us and said ‘Merry Christmas,' " recalls adoptive mother Joy Pryor of the incredible moment on Nov. 19, 2009 in a Kansas hospital, when her dreams of becoming a mother finally came true.</p>
<p>On a recent winter evening in their Guelph home, Joy and her husband Malcolm Pryor work together to dress little Julian in his best Christmas jammies. They exhibit all the caution of new parents and their constant cooing to this happy and thoroughly loved baby boy is a joy to watch. They waited so long. They tried so hard.</p>
<p>The couple's journey began soon after they married in July 2006. Joy, now 40 and Malcolm, 55, were childless and desperately wanted a family. Both are high school teachers: Joy teaches at Forest Heights Collegiate in Kitchener; Malcolm at Centre Wellington in Fergus. The idea of adoption rattled around in their minds, but not as a preferred option. At least, not at first.</p>
<p>After thousands of dollars and four years of fertility treatments leading to one disappointment after another, the idea of adoption eventually blossomed as Joy researched possibilities, starting with the provincial Ministry of Children and Youth Service (www.adoptontario.ca[http://www.adoptontario.ca]). They knew there would be hurdles, not the least of which was their ages. Joy noted the province has a strong support system for unwed mothers as well as legalized abortion, and few healthy newborns seemed to be available.</p>
<p>"There was so much competition," she said.</p>
<p>So the couple looked further afield, using the ministry's website to locate international adoption agencies, starting in Ukraine, a country where Joy had taught for a few years. Unfortunately, the European nation had tightened its adoption laws. Next was Bulgaria, but the agency there offered only older children. In March 2008, the couple learned that the United States was an option, but they had to hurry because adoption laws were changing in April, effectively eliminating out-of-country adoptions. By applying immediately, they were accepted, launching an incredible chain of events.</p>
<p>"We wanted to be a family," said Malcolm. "We did talk about adoption, if need be, but I didn't know how I'd feel about adopting a baby. But he (Julian) feels like my own baby."</p>
<p>Adoption agencies in Kansas and South Carolina requested they create a scrapbook illustrating their lives, from vacations to family photos, information used by birth parents to choose suitable adoptive parents. Then the Pryors got the call: a young, unmarried couple in Kansas was expecting a child on Joy's birthday, Dec. 11.</p>
<p>"They had another couple in mind, from New York," said Joy. "They'd been waiting (for a baby) for three years."</p>
<p>At the last moment, the couple was offered another child and withdrew their application. This past July, Joy and Malcolm flew to Kansas for an informal meeting with the birth parents at the agency's office. And, like a blind date, both parties feared the other wouldn't approve and wouldn't find them suitable or attractive enough. The young father, a high school drop out, explained his wish was for Julian to have opportunities, to be challenged to excel.</p>
<p>"It was a powerful experience," said Joy. Malcolm added that he knew the father was "extraordinary, bright, I'd say gifted."</p>
<p>After the meeting, there was nothing to do but return to Canada, to their lives and jobs. On Nov. 19, just after midnight, the phone rang: The birth mother was in hospital, nearly a month early. Could it be false labour? Uncertain, Malcolm and Joy went to work as usual. Both had just returned to the classroom after recuperating from two weeks of battling the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>In the middle of a class, Malcolm got the call that the baby was coming. By noon they were on their way, bound for Wichita, Kan. Then the adoption agency drove them to a small hospital in the town of Wellington, Kan. Oddly, Guelph is in Wellington County and Joy's father and grandfather both bear the name Wellington.</p>
<p>Three hours after his birth, the couple stood in the nursery with baby Julian Wellington Pryor cradled in their arms.</p>
<p>But their ordeal was not over. Healthy but premature, Julian was kept another night by doctors. Then there was the issue of getting a passport, which required an 800-kilometre drive to a quick service Houston passport office, plus hotel stays and finalizing documents to allow them to bring the baby to Canada.</p>
<p>After everything Joy and Malcolm had been through, a last-minute Canadian government bureaucratic roadblock only made them more determined to bring Julian home.</p>
<p>Finally, on Dec. 1, all three settled into their home, a family at last. When Malcolm looks outside at the adjacent park and watches moms and dads and children, it no longer hurts because, at last, Malcolm is a dad, too.</p>
<p>Joy said, "the birth mother said ‘you are meant to be a mother.' It felt perfect. It's a life fulfilled."</p>
<p>Little Julian rarely takes his huge eyes off his mother.</p>
<p>"He's our little Christmas miracle," said Joy.</p>

<p>Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health administered and distributed almost 97,000 vaccine doses against pandemic H1N1 flu in its coverage area last fall, the organization's board of directors was told Wednesday.</p>
<p>Medical officer of health Dr. Nicola Mercer told them she's confident that 60 to 70 per cent of the region's population now has immunities and she doesn't expect a significant outbreak here.</p>
<p>Mass immunity protects against such an eventuality with the flu season continuing into the spring, she noted</p>
<p>"It prevents a large-scale outbreak."</p>
<p>Flu is still in the area, but at a low level, Mercer told board members meeting at the health board's office complex on Wellington Road 18, half way between Fergus and Elora.</p>
<p>Among indicators the level of infection is subsiding in the general population, absenteeism rates at area schools are declining, she said.</p>
<p>The 96,563 doses between late October and December represent about 35 per cent of the population, a higher rate of adoption than at some other Ontario communities, including the Waterloo region, she said.</p>
<p>Still, she conceded some areas have administered or distributed doses to even higher percentages of their populations, like some areas of northern Ontario.</p>
<p>Mercer told board directors she'll provide them with a detailed analysis of the H1N1 threat and the health board's immunization program in February.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization last summer declared a pandemic as H1N1 spread from Mexico and the U.S. to other countries, including Canada.</p>
<p>The local health board reported in November that 16 people had been hospitalized with lab-confirmed flu in its coverage area. Ten of these related to H1N1 and the rest from seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Three people died: two from H1N1 and a third from the seasonal variety.</p>
<p>Mercer's health board held a variety of community clinics throughout the area, most notably Guelph, in recent months.</p>
<p>It also introduced special clinics at area schools to reach school-age children. It continues to encourage immunization and offers flu shots at its offices to those requesting immunization.</p>
<p>Mercer said Wednesday that of the 96,563 doses administered and distributed, 43,230 were given to family physicians for their patients. Community clinics were a close second, with health board staff there administering 39,270 shots to people.</p>
<p>As well, hospitals received 3,590 doses. Long-term and retirement facilities were given 4,813 doses and nursing services were provided with 3,660. The University of Guelph - virtually a city within a city - was given 2,000 doses to immunize the campus community.</p>

</p>
<p>With the second wave of the H1N1 pandemic well behind us - and far fewer deaths than expected - some observers have started to question whether a costly mass vaccination campaign was justified.</p>
<p>But two prominent epidemiologists argued yesterday that the broad campaign was necessary and definitely saved lives.</p>
<p>The Quebec government spent more than $82 million on H1N1 vaccines and other materials, and the final bill could climb to $200 million. After having vaccinated 57 per cent of the population, the province is stuck with up to 2 million doses, and is considering selling or giving away the supply to Mexico.</p>
<p>"As it turned out, the mortality and morbidity (illness rate) were less than what we expected," said David Buckeridge, an assistant professor of epidemiology at McGill University. "But the decision (to vaccinate everyone) was the right one, and not to do that would have been irresponsible."</p>
<p>Preliminary research by Buckeridge has shown that in Montreal, the "incidence curve" of new flu cases started dropping with the mass vaccinations.</p>
<p>In Quebec City today, Health Minister Yves Bolduc and Alain Poirier, the province's chief public health officer, are to give an update on the H1N1 situation. Poirier also is to give details about the start of the seasonal flu vaccine, which had been postponed because of H1N1.</p>
<p>Karine Rivard, Bolduc's press attaché, defended the decision to purchase 7.8 million vaccine doses despite initial calls by some to take a more targeted approach.</p>
<p>"There were a number of benefits associated with the vaccination campaign that are incalculable," Rivard said, adding that the campaign raised awareness about the importance of personal hygiene during a pandemic.</p>
<p>In the fall, well before the start of the vaccination campaign, polls suggested only half the population would get the shots. The polls proved to be only slightly off.</p>
<p>In Quebec, 2,481 people have been hospitalized as a result of H1N1 complications since the beginning of the second wave on Aug. 30, and 81 people have died.</p>
<p>Across Canada, the H1N1 flu was responsible for a total of 401 deaths as of Dec. 19, the latest period for which complete figures are available.</p>
<p>That death toll is considerably lower than estimates for the seasonal flu, which range from 1,500 to 2,000. Very few people - beyond the elderly and people with compromised immune systems - get seasonal flu shots, however, so it's hard to make a comparison.</p>
<p>Still, epidemiologists say the H1N1 strain of 2009 will go down in history as the least deadly of the last four flu pandemics. Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard University epidemiologist, has calculated H1N1's death rate is less than 0.1 per cent.</p>
<p>Quebec's H1N1 statistics also belie the prevailing notion during the pandemic that young children - and not the elderly - were particularly vulnerable to dying of swine flu. In fact, 54 per cent of those who died from H1N1 were at least 60 years old. By comparison, two per cent of all deaths occurred in young children and infants.</p>
<p>Forty per cent of all hospitalizations were for young children and infants, however, compared with 17 per cent for those at least 60 years old.</p>
<p>Despite H1N1's relatively low mortality rate, Lipsitch also endorsed the mass vaccination campaign.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Stigma hampers fight against AIDS in Senegal</b>
</div><div>Peter O'Neil   </div>

<div>665 words</div><div>7 January 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>F6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Three gay Senegalese men huddle just after midnight in the corner of a restaurant, wolfing down chicken dinners after agreeing to have their photographs taken on the condition their faces are hidden from view.</p>
<p>All three, who like two-thirds of gay Senegalese men maintain conjugal relationships with wives or girlfriends as part of their public facade, say they live each day fearing that exposure of their homosexuality would provoke contempt, family rejection and possible violence in this poor, predominantly Muslim country on West Africa's coast.</p>
<p>"We face verbal and physical aggression in the streets if people know we are MSM (men who have sex with men)," says Lamine, secretary general of a 95-member group called Xam Xamle ( "teaching knowledge"), which was organized three years ago to convince men, often unsuccessfully, to come out of the shadows to attend meetings on the importance of safe sex and regular HIV testing.</p>
<p>"They call us perverts, they say we are worms."</p>
<p>Dr. Bara Ndiaye, project leader for the non-governmental organization Enda-Sante, said anti-AIDS initiatives led by government and non-government organizations are often viewed suspiciously.</p>
<p>"This society is very hostile toward homosexuals," said Ndiaye, whose organization works closely with MSM and sex workers on issues like safe sex, testing, treatment and nutrition. They assume it is promoting homosexuality."</p>
<p>In early 2008, five men were arrested, and later released, after their photos appeared in a magazine celebrating a symbolic gay marriage.</p>
<p>Then, last December, police burst into the private residence of an HIV outreach worker and arrested nine men, charging them with violation of the country's law against gay sex prohibiting "unnatural" acts.</p>
<p>They were allegedly beaten in prison and then sentenced to eight years in jail, but were released on appeal in April amid international protests from rights groups. Some fled the country as refugees due to threats from outraged citizens who said in public forums that the men should be beaten or even lynched.</p>
<p>Gay men, and male and female sex workers, are by far the two groups most devastated by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has infected 33 million people around the world, two-thirds of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Roughly one in five members of each group is HIV-positive in Senegal, which otherwise has a relatively low infection rate of just under one per cent, according to government estimates.</p>
<p>"We are sometimes rejected by our own kids," said Ndeye, an HIV-positive female prostitute and spokeswoman for a support group called Karlene. "If the community finds out you are a sex worker, your opinion will no longer mean anything. We are not regarded as human beings."</p>
<p>Prostitution is legal in Senegal for women over 21, and those who register get easier access to health care, health information, general support and condoms. But an estimated 80 per cent aren't registered, in many cases because women fear the stigma of being officially labelled a sex worker.</p>
<p>National and international health organizations desperately need to reach out to these groups to ensure they don't spread HIV to sex partners, or in the case of mothers to their children during pregnancy or while breastfeeding, says Michel Kazatchkine, executive director of the $18.7-billion US Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.</p>
<p>He said social stigmatization represents the second-biggest barrier facing national and international bodies waging a multibillion-dollar battle against AIDS, a crisis that has been overtaken in the media by the global financial collapse, war, climate change and the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Colour Photo: Didier Ruef, The Global Fund / These three gay
Senegalese men, who requested their faces not be shown in this
picture taken in a Dakar restaurant, say stigmatization and
discrimination in their predominantly Muslim West African country
make it difficult to educate gay men about the importance of safe
sex and regular HIV testing.   </p>

<p>- - I gave my wife a Slap Chop for Christmas. She gave me a slap in the chops.</p>
<p>- - How typical for city hall: Resur-face the Dawson Bridge, then a few months later tear it up again to do further repairs.</p>
<p>- - The city told us in 1984 when they closed the Dawson Bridge to one lane for four months that the repairs they were doing would be good for 50 years. Did they mean that in dog years?</p>
<p>- - The city should have removed the Dawson Bridge entirely and replaced the main structure with precast beams on the existing concrete supports. They would have had it all finished within a couple of months and the bridge would never need painting or rivets replaced again.</p>
<p>- - According to the city, our house has lost $95,000 in value since 2008 -- yet strangely, our monthly tax payment has increased by almost 10 per cent.</p>
<p>- - Earnings and property values go down and city taxes go up. What a wonderful system.</p>
<p>- - So, Canada's top CEOs make more in three hours than most Canadians make in a year. I can't imagine anyone waking up in the middle of the night thinking, "I'm worth $36.5 million."</p>
<p>- - What to do about the boorish behaviour of the Oilers, both on the ice and off ? I know, let's build them a new arena.</p>
<p>- - If the bill from that Calgary restaurant was actually justified, the restaurateurs wouldn't have knocked off $4,500 when the Oilers complained. They would have called the police.</p>
<p>- - The moment one of the Oilers took a swig out of a bottle of expensive brandy, their credibility went out the window.</p>
<p>- - The Oilers have embarrassed the city beyond belief with their cheapskate attitude in that eatery, and in Calgary of all places.</p>
<p>- - I hope all the people who were quick to judge the Oilers are sorry now that the full story is coming out. With the liquor commission investigating, the restaurant owner will have a choice to make. If he insists the $18,000 bill was correct, he will be admitting he overserved the team. If he says he didn't overserve them, he will have to admit he overcharged them.</p>
<p>- - Voting for the Wildrose Alliance is the equivalent of trading the entire Oilers team for the Maple Leafs.</p>
<p>- - Instead of sending observers to monitor elections in the Third World, Canada should instead send a team to the next Alberta P.C. convention.</p>
<p>- - Based on her track record, if Iris Evans was a meteorologist, she couldn't accurately predict yesterday's weather.</p>
<p>- - If our government wants to economize, install MRI machines in the airports instead of the naked scanners. That way, they can check for weapons and at the same time diagnose ailments more quickly and efficiently than Alberta Health.</p>
<p>- - So children under 18 will be exempt from the full-body scan. That's understandable, but aren't a lot of these suicide bombers children?</p>
<p>- - If you're against the idea of being scanned at the airport, there is a simple solution: stay home.</p>
<p>- - Why has Parliament been pro-rogued? For the amount of money these people are being paid, they should get back to work.</p>
<p>- - We clearly don't get the message behind the story of the boy who cried wolf. How else can you explain our collective gasps at Y2K, WMDs, H1N1 and now the "Oh no, it's going to cost 10 times more to care for twice as many Alzheimer's patients."</p>
<p>- - Shame on my son's ex-wife, who defied a court order and hid the children from their financially responsible and loving father over the holidays.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Top 10 Health Stories; The Year In Review</b>
</div><div>Evra Taylor Levy And Eddy Lang   </div>
<div>For Canwest News Service</div>
<div>809 words</div><div>7 January 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>E1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Who would have imagined that a viral infection in a young Mexican boy would lead to a global pandemic with huge public health implications? But there was more to learn about health in 2009 than the impact of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>This edition of HealthWatch recaps the top 10 stories from a year filled with important scientific developments.</p>
<p>- Preventing falls in the elderly. Falls in the elderly can result in a downward spiral in health, so prevention is key. Research is showing that specific exercises designed to improve reflexes and stability have important benefits when it comes to preventing falls. General exercise helps, as well, but not as much as a program that targets equilibrium.</p>
<p>- Exercise benefits cancer survivors. Fighting cancer takes a lot out of a person and while survivors can claim victory, their ability to function does not always return to normal. Fortunately, recovery is aided considerably by a regular exercise program that restores energy and allows the disrupted parts of a cancer survivor's life to fall back into place.</p>
<p>- Good news for dieters. Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate diets are viable alternatives to -- and may even be superior to -- the low-fat, calorie-restricted diet that has traditionally been advised for people needing to shed weight and who may have risk factors for heart attack and stroke. A study showed only small differences between the three approaches, allowing dieters to individualize their choice based on their health profile and personal preferences, increasing their chance of success.</p>
<p>- Not all cancer screening is good for you. Evidence continues to mount that, sometimes, getting screened for cancer can cause more harm than good. Tests lead to more tests and treatments, some of which can be unpleasant and harmful, resulting in treating some slow-growing cancers that would never have threatened one's health. In some cases, the decision to get screened becomes an informed personal choice rather than a strong health recommendation.</p>
<p>- Eating less may make you smarter. With the "silver tsunami" approaching, the need to find ways to head off declines in mental functioning becomes a top priority. In addition to the convincing benefit of exercise, new research this year also supported the notion that reducing calories can improve performance on skill-testing questions that are a struggle for the aging brain. Is it time to drastically reduce your caloric intake? Not just yet, but the benefits for your heart and waistline may be other reasons to consider it.</p>
<p>- Post-traumatic stress disorder: we need to talk. As many as one in 10 may develop PTSD in their lifetime, yet the vast majority of cases are undiagnosed and untreated. This leaves PTSD victims unable to fully function, but there is hope. Certain types of talk therapy seem to be the most effective, along with group therapy and peer group support. When it comes to getting help for PTSD, earlier is better.</p>
<p>- Should tanning beds be put to rest? Scientists from the World Health Organization recently declared tanning beds carcinogenic for humans. The most ominous warning related to those under age 30, raising their risk of melanoma, a common and deadly type of skin cancer, by 75 per cent. The bottom line? Tanning beds should be discouraged for those most at risk, especially pale-skinned youths.</p>
<p>- Not all antidepressants are created equal. Most research indicates that depression results from an imbalance in brain chemicals that affect mood and motivation. But everyone's biology is different and no two people will respond alike to treatment. An individualized approach always trumps the best research evidence, and a good dose of patience may be just what the doctor ordered when trying to find the medication that works best for you.</p>
<p>- Growth and the ADHD medication Ritalin. Placing a child on ADHD medication can be an agonizing decision, especially in light of the concern that these stimulant drugs may inhibit children's growth and weight gain. Researchers found that while there was a measurable impact on growth, the effect was small and lessened over time. There are no definitive answers, yet, so decisions must be made with imperfect information. ADHD medications are meant to be used when non-medical approaches are not effective, and should be used at the lowest possible dose to have their desired effect.</p>
<p>- New guide targets addiction. Substance abuse exacts an enormous human toll and is directly linked to more than 47,000 deaths annually, yet, health-care providers are often at a loss to detect problems and offer help. A newly published guide from the U.S. National Institutes of Health offers information and advice, examines the root causes, and outlines 13 core principles of treatment, addressing both the psychological and physical issues.</p>

<p>In a new study of how the H1N1 flu virus spreads through commercial air travel, researchers have found that not only can the number of in-flight infections be predicted based on just one fellow passenger carrying the virus, but also that people travelling in economy class are much more likely to become infected than are people flying first class.</p>
<p>The study, published in the current online edition of the journal BMC Medicine, was conducted by Sally Blower, director of the Center for Biomedical Modeling at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behaviour at (too long-winded, jg)the University of California in Los Angeles, along with Bradley Wagner and Brian Coburn, postdoctoral fellows in Dr. Blower’s research group.</p>
<p>“Importantly, we found that the number of infections that would occur on a flight was very dependant on which cabin the infected individual was sitting in,” Dr. Blower said in a release. “We found that many infections could occur if the infected individual was travelling in economy class, but relatively few if the individual was travelling in first class.”</p>
<p>Two things explain the greater likelihood of catching the virus in economy class, the researchers said.</p>
<p>“Primarily, it’s the more crowded conditions in economy,” Dr. Coburn said. “And unfortunately, there is a very high probability – 75 per cent – that if an infected person is on board, they will be in the economy cabin.”</p>
<p>Using Mathematical modelling techniques enabledallowed the researchers to predict in-flight transmission rates. A five-hour flight would likely result in two to five infections, according to the study. Five to 10 people would be infected during an 11-hour flight, while seven to 17 infections would occur during a 17-hour flight.</p>
<p>To make these predictions, researchers used the Wells-Riley equation, which is designed used (repetitive) to predict the size of outbreaks within buildings and other enclosed environments. The equation is based on the number of individuals exposed to an infectious pathogen, the respiratory rate of the infected person, the length of exposure to the infectious droplets and the concentration of infectious viral particles over time.</p>
<p>While previous research has shown that smallpox, measles, tuberculosis, seasonal influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome can be transmitted during commercial flights, this is the first study to predict the number of H1N1 flu infections, that could occur during a commercial flight, the researchers said.</p>
<p>“Clearly it was air travel, by transporting infectious individuals from the epicentre in Mexico to other geographical locations, that significantly affected the spread of H1N1 during the outbreak last spring,” Dr. Coburn said. “However, until our study, it hadn’t been determined how important in-flight transmission could be.”</p>
<p>Given the results of the study, researchers said that air-travel restrictions could be one potential (redundant)means of controlling influenza pandemics.</p>
<p>“Our results imply that one individual travelling by plane, by infecting other travellers on the same flight, could cause multiple simultaneous outbreaks in different geographical locations rather than causing only one outbreak,” Dr. Wagner said. “For that reason, quarantining passengers who travel in economy class on long-haul flights could potentially be an important control strategy this winter.”</p>
<p>But for those people with extra money to spend, fear not.</p>
<p>“There is no point in quarantining passengers in first class,” Dr. Wagner said.</p>

<p>Accused bomber charged</p>
<p>DETROIT -- A Nigerian man accused of trying to blow up a Detroit-bound <span class="companylink">Northwest Airlines</span> flight on Christmas Day was indicted Wednesday on charges including attempted murder and trying to use a weapon of mass destruction to kill nearly 300 people.</p>
<p>Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, was travelling from Amsterdam when he tried to destroy the plane by injecting chemicals into a package of pentrite explosive concealed in his underwear, authorities say.</p>
<p>Troops coming home: PM</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Stephen Harper says virtually all Canadian soldiers will leave Afghanistan by the end of 2011, making some of his most definitive statements yet on his vision of Canada's future role there in an interview with Canwest News Service.</p>
<p>Parliament has already decided that the combat mission involving about 2,500 troops in southern Afghanistan centred around Kandahar will end in 2011. The Department of National Defence has already started preparing detailed plans to move troops and material home.</p>
<p>But at various times over the last two years since that decision was made, there has been some consideration about using Canadian Forces personnel in a different or non-combat capacity or to station Canadian soldiers in a different, more peaceful part of the country.</p>
<p>"We will not be undertaking any kind of activity that requires a significant military force protection, so it will become a strictly civilian mission," Harper said.</p>
<p>Elephant kills mom, tot</p>
<p>NAIROBI, Kenya -- A lone elephant charged out of the brush as an American family was hiking near Mount Kenya and trampled to death a mother and the one-year-old daughter she held in her arms, officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Four adults and the baby were walking with an unarmed guide just outside Mount Kenya National Park on Monday morning when the elephant charged, said Kenya Wildlife Service official Michael Kipkeu.</p>
<p>The family was hiking on a nature trail about two kilometres from the Castle Forest Lodge, where the family was vacationing, said the owner, Melia van Laar. "The elephant emerged from the bush at full speed without any warning," van Laar said. "Everybody ran away, but the lady, burdened by the weight of the baby, perhaps, or in panic, was not able to run fast enough."</p>
<p>Vaccine lent to Mexico</p>
<p>TORONTO -- Canada, which has a large surplus of H1N1 vaccine on its hands, announced Wednesday it will lend some to Mexico.</p>
<p>Canada's NAFTA partner has ordered vaccine from manufacturers Sanofi Pasteur and <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, but won't take possession of the bulk of its supply until the end of this month.</p>
<p>So this week GSK Canada will ship five million doses of adjuvanted vaccine from Canada's stockpile to Mexico. Later, GSK Canada will put five million doses of adjuvanted vaccine from Mexico's order into the reserve the company is holding for Canada.</p>
<p>The move was announced in a press release, which stipulated that the vaccine will be replaced by the end of March. The loan was triggered by a request from Mexico, the Public Health Agency of Canada said.</p>

</p>
<p>How will we remember the political year that was 2009? During the past dozen months Canada's two main parties experienced see-saw swings in support, while offering few solutions to the country's most daunting policy dilemmas.</p>
<p>As at the beginning of 2009, Canadians were left wondering at the end of the year how Ottawa will go about ridding itself of a bulging federal deficit that has ensconced itself on the Canadian body politic.</p>
<p>Wondering, too, how the country will reconcile Alberta oilsands expansion with the imperatives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>And what Ottawa will do as a NATO member to address the mayhem and murder in Afghanistan post-2011 as a deadline for the Canadian Forces' military withdrawal fast approaches. While these hot potatoes simmered, the political parties were on full boil with their own problems.</p>
<p>Liberals, last January, were raring to go with their new leader, Michael Ignatieff. Polls had them tied with the governing Conservatives by the time the tulips bloomed in Ottawa. Then -- whoosh -- all the petals fell off in the cool autumn air as Liberal support cratered.</p>
<p>The Conservatives, meanwhile, who were in the dumpster in early January following Stephen Harper's desperate appeal for a parliamentary recess last Christmas, spent 2009 climbing steadily in the polls.</p>
<p>The party's support reached majority territory by October when the PM dared to play the piano for voters at a National Arts Centre gala and, in doing so, looked -- ye gods -- human.</p>
<p>It was a year when New Democrats had some success, finding gut-punching issues to champion -- the harmonized sales tax adoption in B.C. and Ontario, and the pensions plight. But the party remains no closer to convincing voters it's a realistic governing alternative at the federal level.</p>
<p>The election everyone widely anticipated throughout the year never did materialize. But at least the notion has been put to bed for awhile, given the Grits' faltering condition. Meanwhile, a Nanos poll announced in December that Canadians are in a better mood than a year ago, with 64 per cent thinking Canada is moving in the right direction, up from 53 per cent in 2008.</p>
<p>Some fun stuff happened in 2009 as well. Gov. Gen. Michaelle Jean got herself a new Afro hairdo. Defence Minister Peter MacKay finally got himself a would-be wife in Jana Juginovic. And U.S. President Barack Obama paid a visit to Ottawa, for a few hours.</p>
<p>Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, also dropped in and stayed longer, but, in terms of excitement and crowds, there was no contest between the two visits.</p>
<p>Canada got nine new Conservative senators in 2009, to join 18 others appointed last December. The tally currently is 46 Conservative senators and 51 Liberals. Any guesses about which party will lay claim to the six additional seats in the Red Chamber that will need filling by the end of 2010?</p>
<p>This was a year when Canadians finally got the truth, or as near as they'll ever get, in two separate government inquiries: the Braidwood Inquiry into the 2007 Vancouver International Airport death of Robert Dziekanski after he was repeatedly Tasered by four Mounties ,and the Oliphant Inquiry into business dealings between Brian Mulroney and Karlheinz Schreiber. Testimony at both events was nauseating.</p>
<p>It was also a year for hand-wringing about climate change and how Canada's petro-powered economy is going to adapt to a new world order.</p>
<p>A year, too, for hand-washing as people got the willies about the H1N1 virus even if they didn't get the flu itself.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>GUELPH - Both Guelph Gryphon basketball teams return to league play Wednesday by hosting the Laurier Golden Hawks at the Mitchell Athletics Centre.</p>
<p>The games will be the start of West Division play for both teams.</p>
<p>In the men's league, the Gryphs, Laurier and Brock Badgers are tied for sixth in the eight-team division with 3-5 records. Lakehead leads at 7-1.</p>
<p>In the women's league, the Gryphs are eighth at 1-7 while the Golden Hawks are sixth at 3-5. Windsor leads at 8-0.</p>
<p>The women's game is slated for 6 p.m. while the men's game is to tipoff at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Women's Hockey</p>
<p>The Gryphons returned to OUA league play with a 6-4 loss to the Toronto Varsity Blues in Toronto Monday to drop to 8-5-2 on the season. The Blues led 3-1 at the end of the first period and 6-2 after the second. Jenna Lanzarotta, Katherine Van Vlack, Tayne Hewer and Tamara Bell had a goal each for Guelph while Dayna Kanis assisted on two of the goals. Tori Woods, Lucia Mazza, Carla D'Angelo and Alix Mullin each had one assist. Lindsay Hill led Toronto with a pair of goals while single goals were netted by Karolina Urban, Brenley Jorgensen, Callie Bazak and Ragan Danford. The Gryphs were to play the York Lions Tuesday. Both games were originally scheduled for November but were postponed due to the OUA's policy on confirmed cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>Men's Hockey</p>
<p>The Gryphons scored six consecutive goals on their way to a 7-2 victory over the Canisius Golden Griffins in exhibition play at the Amherst, N.Y., Pepsi Center. The Gryphs led 2-1 at the end of the first period and 4-1 after the second. Guelph also scored five power-play goals. Kris Belan and Jon-Thomas Macdonald hit for two goals apiece for the Gryphs while single goals were added by David Volpe, Derek Knowles and Patrick Campbell. Tim Priamo, Thomas Kiriakou and Barrett Brook each had three assists while Campbell had two and Volpe and Macdonald had one apiece. Matt Zuke and Cory Conacher scored for Canisius. The Gryphs return to OUA play Friday with a game in Oshawa against the UOIT Ridgebacks.</p>
<p>Men's Volleyball</p>
<p>The Gryphons were edged 3-2 (12-25, 25-18, 20-25, 25-15, 16-14) by the Regina Cougars in the bronze-medal game of the Brian Mallard and Associates Invitational men's volleyball tournament in Saskatoon. Earlier in the tournament, the Gryphs lost 3-0 to Saskatchewan before defeating the Huskie Alumni 3-1 and Regina 3-2. The Gryphs are to host the RMC Paladins Friday and the McMaster Marauders Saturday, both at 8 p.m.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The dirty lowdown on our obsession with filth; The war on dirt might be hurting our children</b>
</div><div>The Economist</div>
<div>910 words</div><div>6 January 2010</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Grub, filth, grime, muck, gunk, slag, grit, grunge, smut, dross, dust, sludge. Insulted, hounded, and despised, dirt these days has nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>A constant shower of advertising and health warnings orders you to scrub, cleanse or purify every corner of the body, office or home. Bugs lurk at every turn. Skin, as much as household surfaces, must be scoured, sterilized and sprayed. The latest scare is the computer keyboard: Supposedly it contains nearly 70 times more microbes than the average toilet seat.</p>
<p>The effort to remove dirt, and imbue bodies and bathrooms with the scent of tangerine, mint, or almond instead, is big business.</p>
<p>Each year, the world spends $24 billion on soap bars or liquid gels and wash, according to <span class="companylink">Euromonitor International</span>, a research firm. Another $106 billion goes on cleaning laundry, dishes, bathrooms, and other surfaces, including the baths and showers the bodies themselves get scrubbed in.</p>
<p>Shock studies periodically expose and deplore sloppy habits. Fully 76 per cent of kitchen-sink cloths are infested with germs. One in three American men does not wash his hands after using a public lavatory. Worries about the spread of swine flu are currently doing wonders for the market in pocket-sized antimicrobial hand wash.</p>
<p>There is nothing fixed, however, about Western fascination with dirt - or terror of it. As recently as 1965 only half of British women wore an underarm deodorant. Back in 1940 just over half of American households had a proper bathroom. In 1951 nearly two-fifths of English households lacked a bath - and not only for reasons of postwar poverty.</p>
<p>The English language demonizes dirt. It is packed with phrases such as "to do the dirty," "to dish the dirt" or "dirty money" or "dirty word." In England, police officers are denounced as "the filth." Those of humble origins were born "dirt poor," and the wealthy are often "filthy rich."</p>
<p>The act of washing, whether of a corpse in Jewish culture or of the hands and feet of the happy couple in a Hindu wedding ceremony, carries ritual symbolism in many cultures and faiths. Many religions link ablution to absolution.</p>
<p>Just as public-health reform in 19th-century industrial England and North America concentrated on the need for basic hygiene, so do today's efforts at curbing disease in the poorest parts of the world. Pumping clean water into villages and slums, and encouraging hand washing, are considered two of the most efficient means of reducing infant mortality.</p>
<p>Each year, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, 3.5 million children die from diarrhea or related diseases that could be prevented by simple hygiene.</p>
<p>Yet, in the West, standards of cleanliness seem to have moved beyond science into the realm of fashion and fad. Certainly, the array of sprays, gels and lotions, to be applied in vast shrine-like bathtubs or under today's power showers, would have appalled much of Europe for most of the past millennium.</p>
<p>These days, marketing has turned to the need to get rid not just of dirt but of stress, too. Bathrooms have become temples of relaxation. Mosaic tiles and sunken baths nod to Greek and Roman inspiration; organic bath essences promise spa-like regeneration.</p>
<p>North Americans still buy more bars of soap than Europeans each year. But, if liquid washes are included, Europeans today only just trail us in spending per person.</p>
<p>Today, the message is not just to disinfect surfaces but to avoid contact with them at all. There are automatic-flushing toilets, foot-operated taps and strange-looking devices that enable you to open door handles by applying pressure with the forearm.</p>
<p>"With all the advances in restroom hygiene, it's hard to grasp why the door handle has been so universally ignored," declares a maker of such products. Japanese high-tech lavatories have a built-in temperature-controlled nozzle that squirts water to wash your bottom, then dries it with warm air, delivering a "hands-free clean."</p>
<p>Has the persecution of dirt, however, gone too far? Some immunologists believe that children now growing up in hyperclean, sterile environments are failing to develop immune systems properly because of inadequate exposure to bacteria.</p>
<p>This idea, the hygiene hypothesis, is a possible explanation for growing rich-country incidences of eczema and other allergic diseases, which are rare in poorer lands.</p>
<p>First-time parents, writes Mary Ruebush, an American immunologist and author of Why Dirt is Good, frantically try to keep their babies away from dirt. "When that pacifier falls on the floor, the parents cannot throw themselves on it quickly enough to wash it off, soak it in bleach, run it through the dishwasher, the microwave, you name it."</p>
<p>The trouble is, she adds, such a baby will not have the contact with germs that are needed to build up a strong immune system. Children rather should be encouraged to play in the dirt.</p>
<p>The idea is gaining some ground. <span class="companylink">Unilever</span>, for instance, has an advertising campaign for OMO, its laundry-cleaning brand, titled Dirt is good! The firm's market research showed that mothers were frustrated by the message that dirty clothes are bad. "We wanted to reposition dirt as an expression of freedom," explains Weed. Let children get dirty, goes the message, safe in the knowledge that OMO will clean up afterward.</p>

<p>BOWDEN PAYS THE PRICE A TAX MAN'S BEST FRIEND</p>
<p>The NCAA has upheld its decision to take wins away in as many as 10 Florida State athletic programs, including up to 14 from former football coach Bobby Bowden.</p>
<p>Bowden retired with 389 wins after Florida State's Gator Bowl victory over West Virginia on New Year's Day. The Infractions Appeals Committee said yesterday the co-operative efforts of the university in the academic cheating scandal involving 61 Florida State athletes failed to outweigh the aggravating factors in the case.</p>
<p>Italian media reports say authorities are planning to auction off diamond earrings seized from Diego Maradona as part-payment of the former Napoli star's unpaid tax bill. The earrings were confiscated by tax authorities last year while Maradona was in an Alpine resort in northern Italy.

<p>Former Renault Formula One team boss Flavio Briatore had his lifetime suspension from motor sports overturned by a French court yesterday. F1's governing body, the FIA, banned Briatore in September after it ruled he had ordered Renault driver Nelson Piquet Jr. to deliberately crash his car to help teammate Fernando Alonso win the Singapore Grand Prix in 2008. Briatore denied a role in the scheme and took legal action to be reinstated. The Paris court did not immediately explain its reasons for overturning Briatore's ban.</p>

</p>
<p>Seasonal flu clinics are coming to Hamilton next Monday.</p>
<p>The city's public health department has posted its clinic schedule on its website at hamilton.ca/influenza.</p>
<p>The clinics are a chance to get a regular flu shot, but also to get an H1N1 vaccination for those that still haven't received one.</p>
<p>There are no known cases yet of seasonal influenza in Hamilton or Ontario, said Dr. Elizabeth Richardson, Hamilton's medical officer of health -- something that suggests H1N1 may be becoming the new seasonal strain of flu.</p>
<p>But it can't be known until later whether seasonal flu has been fully replaced by H1N1.</p>
<p>"You can only ever determine in retrospect," said Richardson, adding the H1N1 pandemic in Hamilton has definitely tapered off.</p>
<p>She said it's best for people to get both shots so that they are prepared for the presence of both types.</p>
<p>Anyone over six months of age who lives, works or attends school in Ontario is eligible. Please bring Ontario health cards to speed the process.</p>
<p>Clinics are at 10 locations and run from Jan. 11 to 22.</p>

</p>
<p>Canada will announce plans for some of its excess supply of the H1N1 vaccine Wednesday, government sources said.</p>
<p>The move comes as the World Health Organization prepares to make the first deliveries of donated vaccine to developing countries this week. Though a number of developed countries have donated vaccine to the WHO for redistribution to poorer nations, so far Canada has made no such offer.</p>
<p>Government sources told The Canadian Press on Tuesday that an announcement would be made about a portion of the oversupply.</p>
<p>The lack of generosity has puzzled many who are familiar with the country's long-standing support for the WHO.</p>
<p>Canada ordered 50.4 million doses of vaccine in August, when it was assumed people would need two doses of vaccine apiece. Studies later showed one dose was adequate.</p>

<p>Call it the clash of the weather forecasters.</p>
<p>David Phillips, senior climatologist for Environment Canada, was all over the news last week talking about the terrible year we experienced weather-wise in 2009. Except for B.C. and the North, most parts of Canada were below average -- in Saskatchewan, for example, for nine full months.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, CBC's senior meteorologist, Claire Martin, begged to differ. Standing in front of a chart which read "Hot" in huge red letters, she implied Canadians shouldn't trust their own senses. She wasn't buying the "bummer summer" theory.</p>
<p>And she had a four-point chart to prove it: "2009 was 0.5 C warmer than average. It was the 13th warmest year in a row. The North had its warmest summer ever. And 2000 to 2009 was the warmest decade in Canada and globally-speaking."</p>
<p>How did Martin arrive at her figures? Was it by adding up all of the temperatures in Canada, dividing them by 350, standing on one foot and pulling numbers out of a hat?</p>
<p>And how can she, as a professional meteorologist, ignore the recent "Climate-gate" figures, which indicate that in 2005 -- halfway through the decade -- global temperatures had been "cooling" for seven years?</p>
<p>Martin didn't say. It was basically a matter of, trust me, I'm the expert.</p>
<p>Which is why many of us have grown cynical about what experts say.</p>
<p>It's like the reports that claim a certain percentage of Canadians believe X, based on this survey or that poll. But why can't we be told, even in the course of a short newscast, how the questions were worded, who sponsored the findings and whether other findings indicate something different?</p>
<p>More information would enable us to better assess what we're presented with. And, as a result, we'd be better, more informed citizens.</p>
<p>If confusion were the only byproduct of unsubstantiated information, that would be one thing. But the negative effects of presenting facts and figures in isolation can be far-reaching.</p>
<p>In his book, Denialism: How Irrational Thinking Hinders Scientific Progress, Harms the Planet, and Threatens Our Lives, for example, the New Yorker's Michael Specter documents some of the dangers of putting scientific and "expert" information too simplistically.</p>
<p>"We don't trust authority as we used to, and there are some good reasons for that," he said in a recent TV interview. Because many people now view science as a "political constituency" and distrust scientific claims, "they go on the Internet where they can find support for anything."</p>
<p>And because many experts don't effectively make their case -- and often seem unresponsive to public concerns -- the now-debunked theory, for example, that vaccination leads to autism gained wide credence and caused many people not to have their children inoculated.</p>
<p>The H1N1 semi-debacle is another case in point. Specter said he was amazed that 40 per cent of Americans said from the outset they didn't intend to get vaccinated. (Just over one-third of Canadians eventually did).</p>
<p>But because of conflicting reports -- and little contextualization or debate -- people were unsure what to do. There was little discussion about how, or why, Poland, for example, didn't vaccinate for H1N1; or about what death and illness rates were in Australia, which went through the flu season just before we did.</p>
<p>Specter also discusses the often heated and ideologically blinkered debate over organic food. While we in the West can afford the luxury of organic, locally grown food, he says, most in developing countries aren't so lucky.</p>
<p>One-sided reports from the West don't help. If cassava, for example, could be genetically modified to contain proteins and vitamins, this now nutrient-deficient staple could -- for starters -- prevent widespread blindness. But fuelled by the "fundamentalism of fear," many African leaders "prefer to let their citizens starve to death rather than import genetically modified grains."</p>
<p>As Specter says, "We should talk about these things."</p>
<p>What harm would more widespread discussion of such issues do? And while we're at it, whatever happened to proving your point?</p>
<p>As my favourite detective, Sherlock Holmes, says, "It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly, one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts."</p>
<p>Tell that to the "it's never been hotter" crowd.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Few lineups at H1N1 flu clinics; Mass vaccinations due to close on Saturday</b>
</div><div>Valerie Berenyi   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>566 words</div><div>5 January 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>"Our mom will kill us if we don't get the shot," said Justine Smith, 21, as she briefly stood in line with her brother Nicholas, 19, to get the H1N1 vaccine at one of three influenza vaccination clinics reopened in Calgary on Monday.</p>
<p>Smith said they'd tried to get vaccinated before Christmas but found the lengthy lineups before the mass immunization clinics closed for the holidays on Dec. 23 too daunting. Neither particularly wanted the shot, but at their mother's insistence, the two university students went to the Avenida Village location over the lunch hour.</p>
<p>Lineups were almost non-existent and they were in and out in less than half an hour.</p>
<p>Staff at the clinic reported steady traffic.</p>
<p>Like many parents taking advantage of the day off school Monday, Sheila McKee brought her son in to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>McKee and her husband both received the H1N1 vaccine at work. Over the holidays, her 12-year-old daughter was vaccinated by a pharmacist at <span class="companylink">Safeway</span>.</p>
<p>About 250 pharmacies in Alberta, including 20 in Calgary, are able to immunize everyone except children under 10 years, which meant a separate trip to the Avenida clinic to have seven-year-old Graham vaccinated. "It hurt," he noted.</p>
<p>Dr. Judy MacDonald, deputy medical officer of health, said the clinics are scheduled to operate daily through Saturday at Avenida Village, Brentwood Village Mall and EMS Whitehorn, where the H1N1 vaccine is available to everyone over the age of six months.</p>
<p>"We will at the end of this week reassess what the demand is and determine at that point whether we will continue to have those mass clinics or look at continuing to provide vaccine through our community health centre clinics," said MacDonald.</p>
<p>She said there is continual monitoring for flu outbreaks in schools, extended care facilities and physicians' offices.</p>
<p>"It's been fairly quiet, but just a reminder: people have been together for the holidays and people have travelled extensively. There's more (influenza) activity in other parts of the world that can be brought back. It's still early in influenza season, and I anticipate we're going to see more activity.</p>
<p>"Your best protection is to get vaccinated."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, seasonal influenza appears to have subsided, said MacDonald.</p>
<p>"Again, that can turn around in a day. That is why we also have seasonal influenza vaccine available at our clinics."</p>
<p>Approximately 500,000 doses of H1N1 vaccine were given to Calgarians before the mass clinics closed last month.</p>
<p>According to Alberta Health Services, as of Dec. 30, H1N1 has been linked to the deaths of 69 people in Alberta, the most recent figure available.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tourists told to stay alert; Quebecer dies; But killing isn't expected to reduce travel</b>
</div><div>RENE BRUEMMER; Jason Magder   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>1186 words</div><div>5 January 2010</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>The killing of a Quebec tourist in his Dominican Republic hotel room over the holidays was a tragic event but will do little to alter the vacation plans of Canadian sun-seekers, travel officials said yesterday.</p>
<p>But while the violent death of a Canadian abroad is rare, travellers are advised not to let the atmosphere of an island paradise lull them into a false sense of security.</p>
<p>Canadians should take the same precautions while travelling as they would anywhere, advised Canadian Foreign Affairs spokesperson André Lemay.</p>
<p>Trips to Mexico, Canada's top international travel destination after the United States, were up 10 per cent over 2007 to 1.1 million visits in 2008.</p>
<p>The rise came despite the highly publicized murder of an Ontario couple at a Mexican resort in 2006 and the deaths in Mexico of two young Canadians in 2007, which authorities attributed to a car accident and a fall from a balcony, but the families said were slayings.</p>
<p>Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed yesterday that a Canadian was killed in the Dominican Republic, but would not release details for "privacy reasons."</p>
<p>Media reports identified the victim as Jean Gagné, 41, of Quebec City.</p>
<p>Gagné was killed at a private villa in Sosua on the north coast, near Puerto Plata.</p>
<p>In response to suggestions from some online comments saying travel to developing countries is dangerous and should be avoided, Lemay noted that the murder of Canadian tourists, who took 6 million international vacations in 2008, is a rarity.</p>
<p>"There are millions of Canadians travelling to all four corners of the world," Lemay said.</p>
<p>"It is very rare, Canadians are very seldom targeted. It's just something that happens."</p>
<p>The Canadian Foreign Affairs Department says Canadian travellers should:</p>
<p>- Inform themselves of the country's security situation beforehand on the Foreign Affairs website, which lists everything from violent crime to political upheaval to flooding. For the Dominican Republic, the website recommends that travellers "exercise a high degree of caution," then notes that while violence has affected "a few foreigners," such petty crimes as pickpocketing are common.</p>
<p>- Inform themselves about which neighbourhoods are safe to walk in and those that should be avoided, especially after dark.</p>
<p>- Not flash money around or show signs of affluence.</p>
<p>Basically, use common sense, Lemay said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Montreal travel agent said she didn't expect the news of a Quebecer being killed in the Dominican Republic would reduce the number of Quebecers booking trips there, much like the Ontario couple's deaths in Mexico failed to put a dent in travel to that country.</p>
<p>"We didn't see much of a change in bookings to Mexico after that," said Nancy Parsa, a travel agent at the Uniglobe agency in downtown Montreal. "But after H1N1, then we saw a huge drop."</p>
<p>Le Journal de Montréal reported that Gagné and a friend went on a last-minute trip to the 12-room hotel, surrounded by a high fence and protected by a security guard. On the night of Dec. 30, two men broke into Gagné's friend's room at 2 a.m., tied him up, stole his credit cards, cash and cellphone, and pistol-whipped him. They then went to Gagné's room, and the friend said he heard two gunshots.</p>
<p>The friend, who requested anonymity, told reporters the security guard has been arrested for giving information to the robbers on the whereabouts of the two Quebecers. One other man has been arrested.</p>
<p>Canadians took 2.2 million trips to the Caribbean and Bermuda in 2008, according to Statistics Canada. Half a million of those vacations were to the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>There is always a bit of upheaval after a violent event in a country abroad, said Donavon Gaudette, communications manager for the Association of Canadian Travel Agencies.</p>
<p>"Then people will soon chalk it up to wrong place, wrong time," he said.</p>
<p>"Most of the time, we find Canadians are a cautious bunch - and a trusting bunch, too."</p>

<p>CANADIANS KILLED WHILE ON VACATION</p>
<p>In September 2009, Renée Wathelet, 60, a popular blogger who retired and moved from Outremont to Isla Mujeres, near Cancun, Mexico, was found dead in her apartment. She had been stabbed several times. A 24-year-old from Monterrey, Mexico, was arrested as a suspect.</p>
<p>Also in September 2009, Kamloops, B.C., residents Gordon Douglas Kendall and Jeffrey Ronald Ivans were found shot to death in a condominium they rented in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.</p>
<p>In May 2009, Burnaby, B.C., resident Bouabal Bounthavorn, 29, was shot three times in the head in his hotel room at Hotel Riu in the Mexican city of Cabo San Lucas. His girlfriend was shot once in the foot, but recovered from her injuries. A Los Angeles man and an Acapulco resident were charged in the murder, which police believe was the result of a botched robbery.</p>
<p>In November 2008, Montrealers Elizabeth Russell, 65, and Michael Moss, 73, were killed in terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, which claimed the lives of at least 172 people.</p>
<p>In May 2007, Jeff Toews, a 34-year-old Albertan, died after falling from the balcony of a resort in Cancun, Mexico. However, Toews's family believes he was the victim of a beating.</p>
<p>In August 2007, St. Laurent resident Sandra Barbadoro, 30, a kindergarten teacher at Twin Oaks elementary school in Laval, was killed in a hit and run as a jeep ran into her in Uganda's capital city, Kampala. She was volunteering as an English teacher for a literacy program.</p>
<p>In February 2007, 82-year-old Edmonton woman Ingeborg Jandura was found dead by police called to handle an argument at the couple's time-share unit in Waikiki, Hawaii. She had be stabbed more than 100 times. Her husband, Tadeusz Jandura, was found mentally unfit to stand trial, and was committed to a state hospital.</p>
<p>In January 2007, Janette Lerch, 54, and her husband, Cliff Glasier, 67, were struck by a car in a hit-and-run while walking back to their rented condo in Ajijic, a village southeast of Guadalajara, Mexico. Glasier, a former Chatham, Ont., resident, was killed while Lerch sustained serious injuries.</p>
<p>Also in January 2007, a Woodbridge, Ont., resident, Adam DePrisco, 19, was killed outside an Acapulco nightclub. Mexican officials say he was the victim of a hit-and-run accident, while members of his family say they believe he was beaten to death. Deprisco's friend Marco Calabro said he was thrown out of the bar after dancing with a local man's girlfriend.</p>
<p>In February 2006, 59-year-old Domenic, and Nancy Ianiero, 55, also Woodbridge, Ont., residents, were found murdered with their throats slashed at a resort in the Mayan Riviera. No arrests have been made in the case.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>U of A adopts honour system for sick students; Doctor's note will no longer be required to defer exam or assignment</b>
</div><div>Elise Stolte   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>725 words</div><div>5 January 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>The University of Alberta has permanently done away with doctor-signed sick notes, asking students to self-declare instead when they are too ill to complete assignments or write exams.</p>
<p>As for students wanting to take an 'flu vacation,' or those who 'forgot' to study and need a convenient excuse to postpone the inevitable: "we trust the students," said university registrar Gerry Kendal. "We saw that in high school. We're just not expecting that's going to happen to any significant degree whatsoever (now)."</p>
<p>The university first suspended doctor's note requirements for flu-like symptoms last October, but expanded the policy to include all illnesses and made it permanent at a recent Academic Standards Committee meeting.</p>
<p>The policy takes effect immediately.</p>
<p>Kendal said as far as he knows, the U of A is the first major Canadian university to institute a no-sick-note-necessary policy for all illnesses. Several other registrars have contacted him already, asking to be kept informed about how it goes.</p>
<p>Students will be required to submit a form to their faculty declaring that they were sick, and in some faculties, that declaration may even be witnessed by a commissioner of oaths.</p>
<p>The form will be kept in the students' file.</p>
<p>"Deferring an exam, deferring an assignment rarely pays off anyway," said Kendal. "We have excellent students here and they are not the type of students who would take a shortsighted view."</p>
<p>On the first day back at school Monday, several students disagreed.</p>
<p>"Buying your time is everything. It's very tempting," said Mark Bugiak, a fourth year accounting major. "I definitely think (the policy) will be taken advantage of. People aren't any different in high school than in university. Well, not very different."</p>
<p>But at least those who keep using the same excuse will raise suspicions because their records are on file, said education student Samantha Semchuk.</p>
<p>Matthew Glass, in his second year of political science, said if students are sick enough to miss an exam, they should be going to see a doctor anyway and a sick note helps instructors make a more objective decision about rescheduling.</p>
<p>"You should be at least required to prove it," he said. "Otherwise what about students who worked hard and put in the time?"</p>
<p>"It's unfair," said education student Anna Christensen. "I can see a lot of people taking advantage of that," she said. When she was sick with the flu last semester, she went to the doctor anyway, even though she felt guilty leaving her house to come on campus.</p>
<p>Staff at the University Health Centre have voiced their support for this policy change for years, said Kevin Friese, administrator. They used to have lineups of sick students out the door and down the hall at exam time.</p>
<p>"Ethically speaking, it just doesn't make sense," he said. "You should be home. You should be resting, not dragging yourself out of bed to try to get a sick note."</p>
<p>The requirement for doctor's notes puts unnecessary demands on the health system, he said. And during the H1N1 wave last semester, when the number of students donning masks in the waiting room with flu symptoms rose 54 per cent over the year before, it was a relief to forget about the paperwork. "That made a huge difference."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, officials at NAIT said they require sick notes for anything other than the flu and will continue to. They had no major problems with attendance during the flu outbreaks during the fall semester.</p>
<p>Grant MacEwan University has an online system for students to self-declare when they have the flu and more than 800 students did so in the fall, said spokesman David Beharry.</p>
<p>Administrators there have not considered a permanent or expanded policy for waiving all doctor's notes, but "it's something our senior academic leadership will be looking at."</p>
<p>H1N1 vaccination clinics reopened to the general public in Edmonton on Monday.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>2010 may be worse than 2009 for premier</b>
</div><div>Rob Breakenridge   </div>
<div>For The Calgary Herald</div>

</p>
<p>Among those happiest to tear down old calendars, I suspect, were members of the Alberta government.</p>
<p>By any political standards, it was a grim year for Alberta's Tories. By their own political standards, it was nothing short of a disaster.</p>
<p>Having finally reached the end of a torturous 12 months, does the government now face the horror having to relive it all?</p>
<p>Not that Premier Ed Stelmach is likely to find himself in a Groundhog Day-like scenario where he awakes to find it is Jan. 1, 2009 all over again.</p>
<p>Rather, the likelihood that the political missteps, intransigence and hubris that made 2009 such an unbearable year will be ever-present again in 2010.</p>
<p>Moreover, it would seem as though most of 2009's political headaches -- energy royalties, the deficit, spending cuts, health care -- will carry over into the new year. Those largely self-inflicted headaches remain as such because the Tories seem incapable of devising a coherent strategy for dealing with them. Some of these issues are new or ongoing challenges, but the question of energy royalties was one that the government had ostensibly dealt with.</p>
<p>Now, as 2010 begins, we find ourselves awaiting (yet another) set of changes to the royalty structure.</p>
<p>Of course, the raging populist battle cry of "our fair share" has been replaced by the cold reality of the damage done by the government's first round of changes. As noted in 2009's Global Petroleum Survey from the Fraser Institute, Alberta had become the least attractive Canadian province for oil and gas investment. The one firestorm that might not carry over into 2010 is the H1N1 flu situation, as the abating of the outbreak has led to an abating of sorts of the backlash against the handling of the vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>However, just as people were perhaps ready to put that controversy behind them, an apparent hypersensitivity to criticism on the government's part has helped thrust the matter back into the spotlight.</p>
<p>Following the vaccination fiasco, the opposition Liberals called for the resignation of Health Minister Ron Liepert. The Liberals subsequently laid out their case at a website they set up: liepertmustgo.ca.</p>
<p>Last week, however, the Liberals were informed the website had to go. None other that the Speaker of the legislature himself, Ken Kowalski, has determined that the website is an inappropriate use of public funds since it "singles out" one MLA. Of course, the Liberals could simply use party funds to pay for the site, but it's an absurd demand from the Speaker's office -- one that also sets a disturbing precedent. Should opposition parties refrain from criticizing individual ministers -- or the premier himself -- and simply offer vague critiques of the government?</p>
<p>The order also reveals a tendency on the government's part to attack the messenger -- much like the premier's comments at November's Tory convention where he blamed the media for his woes.</p>
<p>With the same controversies and same attitudes from this government, will 2010 be any different? Other than the names on the cabinet office doors, given the expected cabinet shuffle this morning, little will change.</p>
<p>As the government found itself plunging in public support -- to the point it trailed the Wildrose Alliance by 15 points, and the premier's personal approval rating hit 14 per cent -- it showed little indication that a change in course was in the offing.</p>
<p>That much must have seemed obvious to now-former Tory MLAs Rob Anderson and Heather Forsyth. Their defections to the Wilrose Alliance must now confirm for disgruntled Tories that change is to be found elsewhere.</p>
<p>Having now dug themselves a deep political hole and having entrenched a deep desire for change in Albertans of all political stripes, it's hard to see how 2010 is going to be much merrier for the Alberta government than was 2009. If all we get is more of the same, it could actually be worse.</p>

<p>Ordering the Alberta Liberals to remove a controversial website which seeks anecdotal evidence of health-care chaos is a blow to democracy and an abuse of power.</p>
<p>Speaker of the legislative assembly, Ken Kowalski, has been around long enough to know better than to muzzle the opposition, but did so anyway by deeming the Lipertmustgo.calink on the Alberta Liberals web page to be an inappropriate use of caucus funds. The party says it will now appeal to the Members' Services Committee, as it should.</p>
<p>It's the right and duty of opposition to evaluate the government's handling of significant public policies such as health care. Assessing Health Minister Ron Liepert's record is also fair game in politics.</p>
<p>There's not one personal attack on the website or anything more controversial than the Liberals' request for first-hand stories directly from health-care professionals and patients hurt by health-care reform. Free speech is free speech, even when using online communication tools.</p>
<p>The minister of health is ultimately responsible for the mishandling of the H1N1 vaccination rollout, bed closures and the ludicrous policy reversed only when it became public, that would have seen toiletries and snacks taken away from mental health patients to save $70,000 a year.</p>
<p>What else is happening behind closed doors and where are the cracks in the system? The Liberals are rightly seeking those answers. Instead of trying to silence their critics, the Tories should open their ears to the answers, and get out of the way of what should otherwise be a healthy public debate.</p>

<p>Toronto</p>
<p>Bandits take cash, jewellery from terrified customers</p>
<p>A night out at a Japanese restaurant in Agincourt turned into a night of terror for patrons when two masked men, one carrying a gun, burst in demanding cash.</p>
<p>Police say the men entered Nikada Sushi Robata, on McNicoll Ave. near Kennedy Rd. and Steeles Ave., around 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Restaurant owner Scott Cho said the men took cash, jewellery and cellphones from terrified diners.</p>
<p>"Everybody was just frozen and they kept shouting, 'where is the cash register, where is the money?'" he said.</p>
<p>Nobody was injured. Cho said the two got away in a van.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Trends of the decade</b>

</p>
<p>And so the first decade of the 21st century fades into the folds of history, keen to classify and catalogue it, which is what history does. As they gave monikers to the "roaring" twenties and the "dirty" thirties, future chroniclers will no doubt find a catchy byword for the 2000s. We await history's shorthand.</p>
<p>In the meantime, what were the trends of the last decade? What defined our world and convulsed our lives?</p>
<p>Consider, for a start, terrorism, technology and temptation. Each was a force unto itself, drawing strength from the other. While there is nothing new about using violence to advance political ends, terrorism arrived like a thunderclap in North America on Sept. 11, 2001. That the attacks came in the United States, against the pillars of American financial and military power, assured them maximum exposure in the breathless media age.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the American summer -- that long season of affluence and insouciance that characterized the Clinton presidency in the 1990s -- came to an unceremonious end. At home, America had a seizure -- constricting civil liberties, creating colour-coded levels of alert, constructing the apparatus of national security. Abroad, it went to war in Afghanistan, fitfully, and Iraq, disastrously.</p>
<p>In Canada, we followed. We introduced new laws, too. We fought in Afghanistan but not Iraq. The threat of terrorism, in all forms, darkens our lives. Its spectre hangs over this generation as nuclear war did the last.</p>
<p>Technology, another great force of the decade, has helped terrorism. Sept. 11 was managed with box-cutters, yes, but terrorism is now advancing into cyberspace.</p>
<p>The immediate impact of technology is personal and commercial. Technology insinuates itself into our lives, changing the culture. We are tethered to each other now; the expectation is that one is available anytime and anywhere. Always. In the feverish 24-hour news cycle, we fear falling out of touch. We must talk and we must e-mail (as well as play music, watch movies and read maps).</p>
<p>Privacy is the first casualty. It no longer exists. A generation is growing up in public -- sharing their lives on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, texting secrets, posting racy images.</p>
<p>Technology has created a reign of rudeness. Today, people answer phones at formal meals, talk loudly on buses, reply to e-mail in business meetings.</p>
<p>In the unregulated, unfiltered Internet, bloggers traffic with impunity in rumour, innuendo and gossip. Technology has accelerated the coarsening of culture. Expletives forbidden in public conversation a decade ago appear in titles of best-selling books and on prime-time television. No one cares.</p>
<p>In speech, in dress, in manners, we are less formal than we were 10 years ago. So what if the twentysomething medical office receptionist calls an octogenarian patient by his or her first name? They don't know any better.</p>
<p>The third horseman of the decade is temptation. This is largely the rise of greed and sexual licence. Indulgence and infidelity didn't begin yesterday, but both are enjoying a jolly good run.</p>
<p>The new Bill Clinton is Silvio Berlusconi, not to mention the philandering David Letterman, Tiger Woods and Jon Gosselin (minus Kate). The sins of Bernie Madoff, Martha Stewart and Conrad Black were venal rather than carnal, but they, too, simply couldn't resist.</p>
<p>We are now awash in a depth of scandal, celebrity and sex, unthinkable 10 years ago. While the planet warms, models of vanity and insanity strut down the public catwalk. Experience is devalued. Civic, moral and religious authority fades. Dilettantes enter politics. Athletes cheat.</p>
<p>Kids cannot fail in primary school because everyone is a winner. Universities credential rather than educate. Amid ebbing standards, we sigh and shrug. Whatever.</p>
<p>Still, it isn't all bad. We are wealthier and healthier. Knowledge is spreading and travel is exploding. Both deepen international understanding. Neither the swine flu nor the recession were as bad as we thought. Americans elected their first black president, an epochal event.</p>
<p>In Canada, we've had a decade of constitutional peace. As we become more diverse, the threat to our unity is no longer an independent Quebec. It is managing the great migration (immigration) and the great devolution (the rise of the provinces).</p>
<p>The good news in 2010 is that the survival of Canada, long the uncertain country, is no longer seriously in question. We endure in this funny, feverish world -- and will.</p>
<p>Andrew Cohen is president of The Historica-Dominion Institute. These views are his own. E-mail: andrewzcohen@yahoo.ca. This column first appeared in the Ottawa Citizen.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A nail-biter's guide to breaking a bad habit; Stress, insecurity and psychological trauma all blamed for ragged tips</b>
</div><div>Tara Kruger   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>1333 words</div><div>4 January 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>When you're a chronic nail-biter, everyone's always sticking their fingers in your business. My elementary school teacher once asked me, "Did you know your nails are made of the same substance as a beetle's exoskeleton?" thinking that factoid would gross me out enough so that I'd quit. It didn't. I didn't. I still nibble, gnaw and chew at my fingernails like a rabid squirrel going after Mr. Peanut.</p>
<p>My mom tried everything to nip the problem in the bud early on, to no avail. I've had my hand slapped away from my mouth by my boss, co-workers, friends, boyfriend and complete strangers. I've been a biter as long as I can remember. After a lifetime of daily chewing, my poor nails have been bitten to the quick and beyond.</p>
<p>I don't need anyone to tell me why I should stop. Nail-biting (the medical term is onychophagia) isn't pretty; it can cause infections; it's interpreted as a sign of insecurity by others; and with H1N1 lurking on every door handle, constantly putting your fingers in your mouth is just asking for trouble. I've even developed a phobia of pointing. The last thing I want is for anybody to have a reason to look at the end of my finger. It's downright embarrassing.</p>
<p>"Lots of people bite their nails. It's nothing to be ashamed of," I tell myself, but sharing a body-focused repetitive behaviour with Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton provides little comfort. Then again, even Princess Di balled her hand into a fist when it came time to display her engagement ring, lest her raggedy nails be exposed. It's estimated that 30 per cent of children and 45 per cent of teenagers bite their nails. Most simply outgrow it once they reach adulthood, but not everyone does.</p>
<p>With unshakable resolve and a few tricks, many kick the habit. Rubberband bracelets are flattering -- wear red and you're in style-step with Kabbalah-practising Madonna -- but you have to remember to punish yourself with a snap on the wrist when you catch yourself biting.</p>
<p>Nasty-flavoured nail polish can be effective, too. There is never a drink or mint close enough when that foul taste hits your tongue. It's like licking the inside of the cap of a bottle of nail-polish remover and chasing it with a shot of lye. Tasty!</p>
<p>Band-Aids around the fingertips invite awkward questions, as do gloves in the middle of summer, but you can't bite what you can't get at.</p>
<p>Fake nails seem to work. Press-ons do the trick for me, but they only last a week or so. I've never had gel tips, but I hear they are tough enough to break a tooth if you try to chow down on them. Eventually, though, the falsies must come off and you're back where you started.</p>
<p>I have tried all of these methods and have succeeded in quitting three times. But then my fingers make their way into my mouth again within a few months and all that hard work and will power are for naught.</p>
<p>Wally Muller, who owns Advance Hypnosis in Calgary, says my compulsion to chew is all in my head. Some experience in my past gave rise to an emotion that makes me want to bite, he maintains. He uses regression hypnosis to help people identify the root cause of their bad habit and overcome it. "They don't know where it came from, but they can't get rid of it," Muller says. "They know it's there, but they don't know what it is. It's called anxiety."</p>
<p>Regression therapy is only one type of hypnosis. Direct suggestion -- you've seen the shows where some unfortunate soul clucks around the stage with his arms flapping -- involves the hypnotist reading a script to influence behaviour while the subject is in a trance. You can buy MP3 recordings and CDs online, and do direct-suggestion hypnosis at home. Muller says this method does work, but only temporarily. "Direct suggestion in a lot of situations is a Band-Aid. It'll fix it for a while, but then it comes back because you never really got rid of the cause."</p>
<p>Psychologists and hypnotists get along like doctors and chiropractors, but they do agree on some things: Most psychologists also think nail-biting is stress-induced. So if anxiety is to blame for the problem, then all I have to do is rid my life of stress and presto! Nails to die for. I'd also like a unicorn for Christmas and Albertans to vote for an NDP government in the next provincial election.</p>
<p>So I'm contemplating getting what could be the final nail in the coffin of my bad habit: a mouthpiece. Custom-moulded clear covers that fit over either your top or bottom teeth are an option, as is a device primarily used to discourage thumb-sucking: it has sharp bits that jab any fingers that wander into your mouth. As I also have TMJ, I'm thinking a clear cover could help me overcome two of my oral obstacles.</p>
<p>If you do manage to quit nibbling -- I'm crossing my fingers for you -- the hard part is to keep it up. The battle may be won, but the war is never over. Once you've stopped, buy a handful of nail files and never let yourself be caught without one. Seriously. The slightest sign of a ragged edge can undo all your hard work in a matter of minutes. Invest in some cuticle cream and a few new shades of nail polish. Flawless tips are the best defence against a relapse.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>CHEW CAN DO IT!</p>
<p>- - <span class="companylink">Mavala</span> Stop: Although it looks like a regular clear topcoat, this product has a foul taste that lasts for days, which is especially important during flu-fighting season when we're all washing our hands like Lady Macbeth on steroids. And there's a 33-day program ( "Day 1 tip: Paint the product on all fingernails except one pinky") that holds your hand through the process of transforming from a nail-nibbler into someone with tip-top fingertips. $9.99 at Shoppers Drug Mart (not available at all stores). Online at shoppersdrugmart.caor mavala usa.com.</p>
<p>- - Artificial nails: Acrylic, gel, solar, wrap: These options and more are available at salons all over town, with prices starting in the $40 range. Be warned: If your own nails are in really rough shape (stripped, bitten cuticles, scabbed on the side), you may be turned away and ordered to leave them alone for a few weeks before returning. Then there's the maintenance cost. Artificial nails have to be filled every three weeks or so, starting at about $25 a shot. Referrals are a good way to select a salon, and always be on the lookout for an ultraclean environment in which the reusable tools are sterilized between clients.</p>
<p>- - Rubber band: Associate a given behaviour with a painful consequence enough times, and presto, chango, you won't be engaging in said destructive action quite as often. (Although why this theory doesn't hold when it comes to overindulging in tequila, I don't know.) Take a rubber band and place it loosely around one of your wrists. The second your finger hits your mouth for a good chew, give the band a healthy snap. Yes, it's supposed to hurt. Keep it up for a week or two. Look in a junk drawer near you.</p>
<p>Photo: Supplied / Getting artificial nails are one means of
ending nail-biting, but you might break a tooth if you forget
they're there and chow down.   </p>

</p>
<p>Some of the mistakes I made in 2009 will definitely be repeated.</p>
<p>I learn from history. But I am not always a quick study.</p>
<p>I grew up a bit in 2009. I lived a bit less in my head. I lost weight. I reduced all my vices, by one.</p>
<p>Still, I procrastinated like there was no today. I spent too much time on my computer. I didn't exercise enough.</p>
<p>I swore at rude drivers. I was ticketed by the karma police. My feelings were too easily hurt. Other people were just too sensitive.</p>
<p>I wrote more than 100 columns in 2009 and was asked recently to pick my favourites.</p>
<p>Here's the deal. I'm neurotic. I'm never happy with my work. Yet I can get hissy -- how dare you! -- when someone else craps on it, Did I mention my neuroses? So, talking about my favourite columns of 2009 is going to be painful. And enjoyable.</p>
<p>I did a number of columns last year on the City Centre Airport debate. Like the city itself, I'd visited and revisited this topic far too many times over the years. Council finally made a decision. I wrote about it. Like exercise, it felt good to stop.</p>
<p>My columns on plans for a downtown arena went from positive to negative. Something flipped for me in 2009. I lost some of my boyhood crush on the Oilers and found my inner skeptic.</p>
<p>When the arena proposal is made public in 2010, city council must engage citizens in an objective cost-benefit analysis of the project, as well as the NHL team's contribution to civic pride and quality of life.</p>
<p>If Daryl Katz and company bring forward an arena proposal that respects the aspirations of Edmonton, not just the Oilers, then I might jump on board again. Maybe the team could win a couple of games, too. That might help.</p>
<p>My column in defence of hemp was one of my favourites. It again pointed out our hypocrisy in regards to marijuana and alcohol. No one wrote or called afterwards to call me immoral or stupid. Perhaps we're nearing the end of our reefer madness. Or maybe you're just all smoking something.</p>
<p>I wrote a column in defence of men. It ticked off my daughters. They understood the essential argument, but accused me of being shrill and insensitive. Me? Insensitive?</p>
<p>Man, did I learn a lesson in 2009. I stood in line on the first day for the H1N1 shot. I naively thought I was doing the right thing. First, by eliminating the possibility of being a carrier. Second, by writing a column promoting vaccination as a civic duty. Then the province ran short of the vaccine. Then the e-mails and calls started coming in, accusing me of jumping in the lifeboat ahead of the frail, the ill, the young and the elderly.</p>
<p>I do have a chronic health condition that puts me at risk of pneumonia with every flu. So I make sure I get a seasonal flu shot as early as possible.</p>
<p>But there were definitely people at greater risk who were forced to wait for the H1N1 vaccine. To them, I apologize.</p>
<p>I wrote a column about Kerstin's Chocolate as a substitute for sex. I ate a lot of chocolate in 2009.</p>
<p>I wrote about the new Halloween festival, dEdmonton. I also wrote about the festival's sexy Miss dEdmonton contest. And ate more chocolate.</p>
<p>I wrote a tongue-in-cheek piece against gargantuan baby strollers. Then I came to my senses and wrote a followup column in defence of stroller moms. I don't fear bikers or billionaires. But sleep-deprived, hormonal women are a personal safety concern.</p>
<p>I wrote about local photographer Cindy Gannon's sexy boudoir photo sessions. Yup, more chocolate.</p>
<p>I wrote about the civic budget, local architecture and numerous city-council shenanigans.</p>
<p>Perhaps my favourite column of the year was the saddest one of all. It was about the suicide of 17-year-old Alex Wedman.</p>
<p>His parents, Don and Betty, as well as siblings Eric and Janel, talked bravely about their pain in hope that it would lift the veil of shame and inspire other troubled young people to seek help.</p>
<p>Alex's suicide ended years of bullying at school. So many of you wanted the bullies punished. The Wedmans know that feeling, too, but are trying to move past it.</p>
<p>Finally, just before Christmas I wrote a piece about gratitude. It was one of my favourites, too. The column, in essence, was a published version of my personal gratitude list.</p>
<p>You e-mailed me in droves. People suffering loss and great sorrow said they were inspired to write gratitude lists of their own. In doing so, their spirits were lifted.</p>
<p>The gratitude list was not my idea. I'd heard about it elsewhere and merely channelled it in my column.</p>
<p>So my ego can't take the credit. In fact, it was forced onto the sidelines as I wrote of my good fortune in family, fellows and community.</p>
<p>Thinking of others instead of myself made me truly happy.</p>
<p>Not to worry. It won't last.</p>

<p>I want to believe I am ready for the first cold snap of the season, warm boots in the front hall and wool scarves retrieved from storage. But I never am. It's a bit like the death of someone who has been sick for a long time. You anticipate it, prime yourself to expect it. Always, though, it takes you by surprise. And so it is with the frigid weather.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>An unhealthy year in health</b>

<p>Pandemic, scandal and shortage were among the most common health-related terms over the past year.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus shocked us when its victims tended to be younger and healthier than the victims of most flu bugs. And it angered many when high-profile sports figures and members of hospital boards jumped the queue for shots.</p>
<p>The billion-dollar eHealth Ontario scandal shook us in a different way when we learned how much money was squandered during these recessionary times. Anger flared again at the way the health ministry buried the salaries of some of its highest-paid bureaucrats in the budgets of several of the province's hospitals.</p>
<p>As well, a breakdown at the Chalk River nuclear reactor led to a worldwide shortage of medical isotopes, critical in diagnosing cancer and heart ailments.</p>
<p>The potential severity of the H1N1 virus caused a spike in ER visits and multi-hour lineups at flu shot clinics across southern Ontario. In some ways, the public awareness campaign launched in advance of the clinics' opening worked almost too well. The clinics for specific high-risk groups saw a large proportion of vaccine-seekers who didn't fall into any of the groups. And the death of Evan Frustaglio, an otherwise healthy 13-year-old Mississauga hockey player, led to a greater clamour for shots.</p>
<p>The target was to vaccinate 70 per cent of the population, but by the time the clinics were closing earlier this month, only about 30 per cent of the province's population had been vaccinated against H1N1. More than 300 Canadians had died of H1N1 by early this month.</p>
<p>The eHealth scandal cost David Caplan his job as health minister and resulted in revamped leadership for the beleaguered agency mandated to create electronic medical records for Ontario residents.</p>
<p>A scathing auditor general's report estimated that about $1 billion had been ploughed into eHealth, with little of value to show for the substantial spending. Hundreds of millions of dollars in untendered contracts were awarded to consultants, some of whom demonstrated an outrageously cavalier attitude toward taxpayer-funded expense accounts. All this was happening during the recessionary period in which many taxpayers lost their jobs or had to tighten their spending to keep afloat; it's no wonder taxpayers were angry over the profligate and irresponsible spending.</p>
<p>The provincial government has wisely decided to press on with the mandate of the eHealth agency. Earlier this month, Ray Hession was nominated by Health Minister Deb Matthews to head the agency's board of directors. Three years ago, Hession warned the lack of electronic health records in Ontario was making as many as 32,000 sick people worse every year because doctors don't have access to files of patients they haven't seen before. Sounds like Matthews has found the right man for the job.</p>
<p>The federal government came under fire this year over the shutdown at the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited nuclear reactor at Chalk River, which produced about a third of the world's medical isotopes -- used in diagnostic nuclear imaging and disease treatment. The shutdown, resulting from a heavy water leak in May, was expected to last at least three months; at this point, the aging reactor is not expected to be back in production before spring.</p>
<p>The shutdown has been a substantial political liability to the Stephen Harper government, showing so clearly there is no backup plan in the event of problems at Chalk River despite earlier problems with the reactor. Canada's reputation as a supplier of medical isotopes has been seriously tarnished by the situation. Worse, patients are worried because their physicians must rely on erratic supplies of the critical isotopes.</p>
<p>As always, our health-care system has been under acute pressure this year, trying to make every dollar stretch as far as it can. Hospitals have been warned that's not likely to change; in fact, a funding freeze is possible in the coming year as the province faces a period of multi-year, multibillion-dollar deficits. There's no doubt 2010 will be a rocky and challenging year in the health-care sector.</p>

<p>Children were twice as susceptible as adults to becoming ill with the H1N1 influenza, a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows. If one person in a household had the disease, a child was much more likely to sponge up the germs than an adult. It's more reason for Canada to rethink its strange vaccination strategy, in which children were an afterthought.</p>
<p>Anyone five and older was shunted to the back of the line for the flu vaccine in most provinces. By contrast, the United States allowed young people up to the age of 24 to join the line early on.</p>
<p>When the Public Health Agency of Canada, after consultations with the provinces, published its list of at-risk groups, the main criterion was not who was most likely to get the disease but how likely they were to suffer severe illness, or die from it. That's a reasonable approach, especially in light of shortages of the vaccine.</p>
<p>But after the initial priority groups, including children under five, aboriginals, pregnant women and health-care workers, received their chance at vaccinations, other at-risk groups popped up, which in some cases were at no great risk of dying (police and firefighters, who on the initial PHAC priority list were side by side with children five and over), and in other cases were at reduced risk of contracting H1N1, such as elderly people. The elderly, though not given priority for the vaccine in the U.S., were to be given prompt treatment with Tamiflu, under the strategy adopted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>By the time the vaccine reached Canadian children, it was next to useless. Many had already had the influenza, or had been exposed to it. In effect, public health authorities in much of the country (Saskatchewan and New Brunswick being notable exceptions) left children unprotected. Children were shoved so far down the list that three weeks passed from the first vaccinations and most Canadian children had not been given a chance to protect themselves. This was the very group most likely to get the disease: children have made up about 60 per cent of swine-flu cases.</p>
<p>No, they didn't die in great numbers. But if H1N1 had been deadlier than it turned out to be, they might have. And no one knew with any degree of certainty how severe the illness would be. Canada cited supposed epidemiologic evidence showing they were not at elevated risk of death; the U.S. cited other evidence showing that they were. Far better to err on the side of caution with children's health.</p>
<p>There may be other flus, other pandemics. Canada should never take such chances with its children again.</p>

<p>The story of the Oilers' disputed restaurant bill generated hundreds of comments -- mostly anonymous -- on the Edmonton Journal's website.</p>
<p>Here is a sample:</p>

<p>- These boys will always be welcome at <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>, as long as they pay up front like every one else.</p>
<p>- What were they celebrating? Another loss? How about paying the 18K back to season ticket holders for a terrible year?</p>
<p>- Did they pay the entire cab fare? Or did they argue about that too?</p>

<p>HUSKIES ALUMNI 3, HUSKIES 1</p>
<p>A blast from the past blew threw the PAC during the weekend.</p>
<p>The 2004 Huskies alumni dusted off their volleyball gear and won the Brian Mallard and Associates Invitational final against the host University of Saskatchewan Huskies -- the 2009-10 edition -- 3-1 (23-25, 25-16, 25-19, 25-22) on Sunday.</p>
<p>The alumni team, comprised of mostly the 2004 Canadian Interuniversity Sport championship team, plus the 2009-10 Huskies redshirts, had a 2-1 record in round-robin play at the three-day tournament.</p>
<p>Adam Ens of the alumni was tournament MVP and was part of the last Huskies team to win the annual tournament, in 2004. He said winning the tournament was extra sweet for the players who don't play as much anymore.</p>
<p>"It was fun getting back together with the guys," Ens said. "We were really relaxed and played a little bit like we used to."</p>
<p>Ens, who was a CIS champion and CIS male athlete of the year for all university sports in 2003-04, is now a teacher and senior boys volleyball coach at Rosthern Junior College. He said the alumni get together for senior men's tournaments, but not often.</p>
<p>The alumni looked out of place in the warmup, clad in multi-coloured, non-matching clothes, as if they were going to the Y for a workout. But once the warmups ended, they put on the familiar Huskie white uniforms.</p>
<p>After they dropped a tough first set, they showed they still have what it takes.</p>
<p>"We're a little bit out of shape," Ens said. "We definitely finished the tournament with more legs than we started with. A little bit surprising we came back into form that quick."</p>
<p>Huskies coach Brian Gavlas, who coached all of the players on the alumni team, hoped the tournament would serve as more than a tune-up for the resumption of Canada West conference play.</p>
<p>"(The alumni's winning reputation) was another reason to bring them out, to get them together for the camaraderie and a little bit of nostalgia, but also to get them to interact with our guys," Gavlas said.</p>
<p>The University of Regina finished third, defeating the Guelph Gryphons 3-2 (12-25, 25-18, 20-25, 25-15, 16-14).</p>
<p>Regina's Colin Finch, Guelph's Andrew Revie, Huskies Cole Hintz and Geoffrey Zerr and alumni players Joel Ens and Dan Roth were named to the all-star team.</p>
<p>The Huskies, 5-3 in Canada West, are in Calgary this weekend for a conference series against the Dinos. Their next home game is Jan. 15 against the Winnipeg Wesmen.</p>
<p>HOCKEY</p>
<p>The Huskies women's hockey team recorded a 3-2 road victory over the Lethbridge Pronghorns on Saturday in a make-up game rescheduled from October due to H1N1 concerns.</p>
<p>The Huskies also played the Pronghorns on Sunday. The score was not available at press time.</p>
<p>Breanne George, with two power-play markers, and Shaye Christiansen were the goal scorers for the Huskies. Kendal Tremblay and Brittney Kaye, a native of Saskatoon, replied for the Pronghorns.</p>
<p>The Huskies improved their record to 7-3-3, three points back of Manitoba for second place. The 'Horns drop to 3-6-2.</p>

</p>
<p>So I heard a funny thing come up in conversation again the other day -- not funny nyuk-nyuk, but funny in that curious way of being both an expression that's jarring to the ears and yet perfectly natural.</p>
<p>Twenty-ten.</p>
<p>For 50 years 2010 has been best known in Saskatchewan as a model of durable John Deere tractor, or, at the optometrist's office, some pretty decent eyesight.</p>
<p>Now it's a year.</p>
<p>What's also funny is how we managed to stumble through a whole decade without a common vocabulary for the passing years. At the turn of the millennium, the question was whether we'd borrow from the early 1900s and refer to the upcoming years as "aught-one," "aught-two" and so forth.</p>
<p>No. Not without a rocking chair, knitting needles and an ear trumpet, we wouldn't. Instead we spoke the cumbersome "two thousand and three" and "two thousand and four" as if counting off seconds before rushing the passer in a backyard game of touch football, or we abbreviated to "zero-five" and "oh-six."</p>
<p>Now we've returned to form. Before long -- all too soon, actually -- our recollections will be prefaced by "back in '11" or "the summer of '12," as effortlessly as '67 or '82 is shorthand for the 1900s series.</p>
<p>This twenty-ten deal arrived in a flick, though, didn't it?</p>
<p>Seems like only a few months ago, not 10 years, we were fretting about whether our idiot computer contraptions would flip from 1999 to 2000 without inadvertently blowing up the planet; now we're all sneezing into our elbows to stop a worldwide flu outbreak. From Y2K to H1N1, a decade has lapsed.</p>
<p>So what do we call this past decade? The tens? The aughties? And how will it be remembered by Saskatchewan?</p>
<p>Institutions fell by the wayside and others arose. The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, the grain-growing co-operative whose trademark once towered on the sides of elevators above virtually every town and village, is now the international corporate entity Viterra. Likewise, imagine the curious disbelief of any listener in 1999, the explanations and translations we'd need to make sense for him of such 21st-century Saskatchewan advents as "Mosaic Stadium"; those white plastic grain storage bags fast replacing steel bins as the farm landmarks of the countryside; Corner Gas; the provincial ban on something called texting, or young waitresses in cafes baffled by a beverage order for "Vi-Co."</p>
<p>Anybody else remember, back in 1999, the "information superhighway," so mysterious and unexplored? What a quaint notion. Today we <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and even Twitter each other, no shame whatsoever. We send messages halfway around the world in mere seconds without the cost of a postage stamp, and fast disappearing is the vehicle with an antenna on its front fender for radio reception, much less on its trunk lid for -- what did we call it? -- a "car phone"?</p>
<p>Saskatchewan entered this decade with Premier Roy Romanow, Rider quarterback Reggie Slack and an outrageous gasoline price of 70 cents a litre for regular unleaded; it emerges with Premier Brad Wall, quarterback Darian Durant and the mystery of why the cruel beggars simply don't call it a buck even at the pumps.</p>
<p>We partied until dawn after a Grey Cup victory in which the Roughriders played poorly against a pathetic opponent, and we gawked in stunned disbelief two years later when the football team was in top form against the league's best, led on the scoreboard until the clock ticked down to zero, and yet somehow lost the game.</p>
<p>Sadly, in the past decade, Saskatchewan has had to make room for names on its cenotaphs. Any hopes that the new century would bring international peace were dashed early on. Once again young men and women from the province risk their lives for others in faraway lands.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan celebrated its first century in 2005, still a new land, but now, and for the first time, older than any of its people. The living memory in this province of settlement and optimism, of drought and despair, and of two world wars is fast fading.</p>
<p>It would seem a time of change.</p>
<p>And it is.</p>
<p>During the decade's last five years, in particular, Saskatchewan has charged forward. In cities where not long ago construction cranes on the skyline were novelties, new roads are paved to reach housing developments that push the urban outskirts ever farther. Small towns, even those that once offered land for $1 to anybody willing to relocate and build, are now running out of serviced lots and are rolling out maps to pick and choose where the next houses will be. The T-shirt "Friends don't let friends move to Alberta" is still funny, but has lost much of what once made it downright hilarious, being now passe, so two-thousand and two.</p>
<p>It has become fashionable in certain circles to attribute all of the above, Saskatchewan's recent growth, to something called the new winning attitude. People do need their things to say, of course, but that new winning attitude by definition dismisses previous generations as ... what? content losers? Hardly. No one ever built a road with pick-axe and spade, or taught the children of a one-room classroom, in pursuit of defeat. Without the work of the past 100 years, Saskatchewan would not be in the position to seize upon what it now has.</p>
<p>Economics is a science desperately short on fact, but one of the discipline's few truths is that to wherever prosperity is most promising, people will move. The world's insatiable appetite for energy delivers that promise here, but so, too, does a crowded planet's need for grains, for food, and for potash, for the fertilizer to grow food. Feeding the world is what Saskatchewan has always done best, so well in fact that during times of surplus and bad politics, farmers of this province shouldered the brunt.</p>
<p>Two-thousand and nine, oh-nine, aught-nine, has already been recorded as the year a recession finally caught up with Saskatchewan. But that will be quickly forgotten, just as all economic markers come and go.</p>
<p>Twenty-ten will write itself. Year-end predictions are for chumps. None of us has a crystal ball, but all of us are allowed our hopes.</p>
<p>Here's hoping for the wisdom to make the most of the wealth that appears imminent, and the humility to know that we are a people, today in Saskatchewan, blessed by place and time.</p>

</div><div>Jodie Sinnema   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>1128 words</div><div>3 January 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>For many years, Frank Horvath was a loyal supporter of MLA Dave Hancock, helping the current education minister during his 2006 run for the premier's job.</p>
<p>Times have changed for the retired teacher.</p>
<p>"Loyalty was one of my weaknesses because I tend to be loyal to people who don't deserve it for far too long," said Horvath, 63.</p>
<p>"I was supporting him because I liked his ideas and I also felt he was closer to having a social conscience than perhaps some of the others running for leadership."</p>
<p>But Horvath now says Hancock hasn't been listening to his concerns or those of his neighbours about the radical changes to Alberta's health system, even after two meetings in June and last December.</p>
<p>Horvath and others formed the Whitemud Citizens for Public Health, a grassroots group in Hancock's southwest Edmonton riding that aims to either convince the minister and the Stelmach government to reverse changes made to the health system -- bed closures at Alberta Hospital, a near-freeze on hiring nurses, a new pharmaceutical strategy that increases drug costs for some seniors while reducing it for others -- or to replace the government altogether.</p>
<p>"What choice do we have?" Horvath asked. The Whitemud Citizens group expects 200 people at its inaugural community meeting Jan. 11 at Riverbend United Church. "We must act. If we don't take action, who will?"</p>
<p>Horvath's group isn't alone. Growing discontent is sparking movements such as Reboot Alberta, in which unhappy Red Tories and Liberals are trying to engage people in politics, and the Courage Project in Calgary, which supports people with independent voices.</p>
<p>Bill Moore-Kilgannon, executive director of a non-partisan but left-leaning advocacy group, Public Interest Alberta, said dissent is increasing. "Organizing at the community level is where people feel most empowered."</p>
<p>He said people are taking action on the health system after experiencing the 1990s cuts, when thousands of nurses were fired, hospital beds and hospitals closed.</p>
<p>"They want to head it off before we go down that road (again)," he said. Moore-Kilgannon believes people are particularly disgruntled with health budget cuts, postponed elective surgeries and the decision to build privately run assisted-living facilities rather than more long-term-care beds because, despite a $1.2-billion health deficit, the province is flush with money in its reserve fund.</p>
<p>"What I'm hearing from people is they think the decisions the government is making around the cuts, around their long-term care policy, etc. are really unnecessary and so they're trying to organize at the community level to challenge that notion," Moore-Kilgannon said.</p>
<p>"Politics is definitely changing in this province and the government ignores these community voices at its peril. There's a strong underground movement that's growing, that is really looking for ways to change the direction this government is going and those voices are across the political spectrum and need to be listened to and respected."</p>
<p>Hancock, out of the country for holidays, wasn't available for comment, but spokeswoman Sharron Theuerkauf expressed surprise Horvath and his group were dissatisfied with their meetings with Hancock, since they hadn't expressed that.</p>
<p>"Dave considers representing his constituents the most important role that he has and therefore welcomes both personal contact and public discussion of public policy issues," Theuerkauf wrote in an e-mail to The Journal. Last April, Hancock held a community focus meeting on health to get input on the government's pharmaceutical strategy. She said Hancock also plans to attend the Jan. 11 meeting of the Whitemud Citizens. "Meetings with constituents are very important to Dave to inform his advocacy on behalf of the constituency."</p>
<p>Dan McKinley, president of the Edmonton Whitemud Progressive Conservative Association, said he hasn't heard many concerns about the health file in his riding, although there were some rumblings about the way the H1N1 vaccine campaign was rolled out. He said Hancock is liked and respected.</p>
<p>"Dave (Hancock) has historically shown a high degree of interest in listening to people," said McKinley, who has worked on Hancock's campaigns for more than 18 years. "At our general meetings, he actively says, 'Look, I need to hear criticism. I need to hear what people are thinking out there because otherwise I don't know what's going on.' "</p>
<p>McKinley said while Hancock may not publicly voice dissenting views on his government -- as did MLA Guy Boutilier who was booted out of the PC caucus by Premier Ed Stelmach when he criticized the government for failing to build a long-term-care centre in Fort McMurray as promised -- McKinley believes Hancock speaks openly about his constituents' concerns during caucus meetings.</p>
<p>"Over the years I've given him bits of criticism I see and I don't tend to get shut down," McKinley said. "I tend to get asked more information about it and I tend to feel it makes an influence on him. That's why I support him."</p>
<p>McKinley said the provincial economy is in transition.</p>
<p>"It creates an awful lot of dissatisfaction, an awful lot of adjustment going on, an awful lot of introspection so I think as a result there's probably a lot of dissatisfaction out there in a lot of respects," he said. He supports the Whitemud residents forming a group on public health. "If they feel strongly, I would really encourage them to continue to voice their opinion. I think there's no question things could be done better and I think public dissent keeps us going."</p>
<p>McKinley believes Hancock will listen.</p>
<p>Horvath said he decided to form Whitemud Citizens for Public Health rather than join groups like Public Interest Alberta or Friends of Medicare in part because he doesn't believe the government takes such groups seriously and aligns them with left-leaning politics.</p>
<p>"A democracy is based on listening to the electorate," Horvath said. "When you have so much power, you should come from that position of power and be open and transparent and engage people in the process.</p>
<p>"Somehow, we've been disenfranchised. Either we haven't been fulfilling our responsibilities as citizens or we've been cut out in some way and it's time for us to take that back, to ensure we don't lose our democratic rights."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Journal readers chip in their two cents; Oilers playing cheapskate on New Year's Eve inspires comments</b>
</div><div>Journal Staff   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>793 words</div><div>3 January 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>"The Oilers can't finish a check nor pay one now either."</p>
<p>That is how Journal online reader "ABC123" responded to Saturday's front-page story describing a New Year's Eve skirmish between Edmonton Oilers players and an upscale Calgary restaurant.</p>
<p>The story sent hundreds of Journal readers scrambling to their keyboards to sound off on edmontonjournal.comall day, and responses were still pouring in at press time late Saturday.</p>
<p>The story, from the Calgary Herald, detailed a dispute that erupted after Oilers players, their wives and girlfriends -- 45 people in all -- wined and dined and then whined over the bill at Osteria de Medici, an Italian restaurant in Calgary, after the Oilers lost 2-1 to the Calgary Flames on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Restaurant owner Maurizio Terrigno complained to the media that the Oilers refused to pay their bill, which totalled nearly $18,000. Terrigno said the players were particularly upset with the $8,000 liquor tab, which included shooters, wine, tequila, rum, Crown Royal rye, Grey Goose vodka, <span class="companylink">Coors Light</span> beer and two $500 magnums of Dom Perignon champagne.</p>
<p>The players "went ballistic" when they received the bill, Terrigno said. He said they demanded a discount on the alcohol portion because they expected to be charged for bottles of liquor rather than each individual drink.</p>
<p>Oilers spokesman Allan Watt later said the matter was resolved after the bill was reduced by $6,000.</p>
<p>The players paid the adjusted bill and left a tip of about $1,800, and have the receipt to prove it, Watt said.</p>
<p>Well, the meal may be over but for Journal readers, the after-dinner conversation continues. And it's lively. Here's a sampling:</p>
<p>- -What intelligent businessman badmouths customers racking up a five-figure bill? Does he think by trying to make the Oilers look bad he's making himself look good? Calgarians should be ashamed of this guy, they are a much classier city than what this guy represents.

<p>Eating Animals</p>
<p>By Jonathan Safran Foer</p>
<p>Little, Brown, $31.99</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>It's time, argues Jonathan Safran Foer, to stop lying to ourselves.</p>
<p>With all the studies on animal agriculture, pollution, toxic chemicals in factory-farmed animals and exposés of the appalling cruelty to animals in that industry, he writes in Eating Animals, "We can't plead ignorance, only indifference. Those alive today are the generations that came to know better. We have the burden and the opportunity of living in the moment when the critique of factory farming broke into the popular consciousness. We are the ones of whom it will be fairly asked, 'What did you do when you learned the truth about eating animals?'"</p>
<p>Some of our finest journalists (Michael Pollan, Eric Schlosser) and animal-rights activists (Peter Singer, Temple Grandin) -- not to mention Gandhi, Jesus, Pythagoras, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, John Locke and Immanuel Kant (and so many others) -- have hurled themselves against the question of eating meat and the moral issues inherent in killing animals for food.</p>
<p>Foer, 32, in this, his first work of nonfiction, intrepidly joins their ranks, inspired by fatherhood, the memory of his grandmother (who survived the Holocaust by scavenging her way to freedom) and something else.</p>
<p>This something else is what made critics of Foer's fiction, the novels Everything Is Illuminated (2002) and Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2005), fall over themselves to praise him. It is a kind of fearless modernity: one part "whatever," one part descendant of Holocaust survivor (we've only got this one life, if that, to get things right) and one part soaringly beautiful, annoyingly entitled liberalism.</p>
<p>What did you do when you learned the truth about eating animals? There's no hiding behind culture in Foer's postwar, post-9/11, square-framed modernism: "Food is not rational. Food is culture, habit, and identity. For some, that irrationality leads to a kind of resignation."</p>
<p>Think your way through it, Foer warns. Define the terms. Choose your priorities. You have that luxury.</p>
<p>You have that luxury because doctors and health advocates agree that vegetarianism is more than adequate (many say more healthful) than a meat-eating diet, especially meat tainted with toxic pesticides, hormones and other chemicals. You have that luxury because so many foods are now available. You have that luxury because there is now so much information on how to live and care for your loved ones without supporting animal agriculture and factory farming.</p>
<p>That said, this book, its author warns, is not a case for vegetarianism. It's a case for being informed and taking responsibility. In the process of asking questions, Foer "came face-to-face with realities that as a citizen I couldn't ignore, and as a writer I couldn't keep to myself."</p>
<p>After a brief, Swiftian modest proposal on our relationship to animals (including a "classic</p>
<p>Filipino recipe" for stewed dog), Foer launches into the various sectors of the animal agriculture industry: chickens, fish, pigs and cattle. Some sections are so overwhelmingly violent as to be unreadable.</p>
<p>Readers of the work of Grandin, a designer of livestock handling facilities and author of several fascinating, enduring, groundbreaking books on autism and animal rights, will have read passages like this before. For those who haven't, especially those who eat meat, the feeling is not unlike gagging, like being the poor sop in a horrible Greek fable who has just unknowingly eaten his family members.</p>
<p>The principal villain in Foer's book is modern industrial farming, if "farming" is really the term for it. If we don't know what factory farming is like, it's no accident. Foer wrote to big industrial farming companies asking for a tour. He wasn't turned down, simply ignored. The only way to see these facilities is to break in at night, and Foer joins a group of animal activists to do just that.</p>
<p>The reader learns a lot from Eating Animals. The world of large-scale chicken farming has been reduced to two breeds: layers and broilers. The lives of neither of these are pleasant, but at least the broilers endure theirs for only 39 to 42 days. (Male layer chicks get far less time, for obvious reasons.) Broilers are bred to fatten up quickly, frequently leaving them unable to walk. On the plus side, at less than a square foot of space each, they have nowhere to go. Strolling around the barnyard is a luxury unknown to these creatures.</p>
<p>One of the chicken "farms" Foer visited (illegally) contained 20 sheds, each 45 feet wide by 490 feet long, each holding about 33,000 birds.</p>
<p>Even, for example, if you thought you were right in buying free-range chickens, you can stop patting yourself on the back. "To be considered free-range, chickens raised for meat must have 'access to outdoors,' which, if you take those words literally, means nothing. Imagine a shed containing 30,000 chickens, with a small door at one end that opens to a five-by-five dirt patch -- and the door is closed all but occasionally."</p>
<p>Foer has a raft of statistics to dazzle us. Industrial farming in America accounts for "99.9% of chickens raised for meat, 97% of laying hens, 99% of turkeys, 95% of pigs and 78% of cattle." And don't think you're getting off by eating fish instead. The fishing industry uses the devious word "bycatch" to describe seagoing animals caught while fishermen are looking for something else, perhaps shrimp or tuna. The rest of it -- 80 to 90 per cent of shrimp-trawling catches, for example -- is merely discarded.</p>
<p>Most of Foer's numbers are American, so we can try to fool ourselves that things are vastly better in Canada. After all, we don't send people to be tortured, do we?</p>
<p>Foer does give us credit for using, at least to some extent, air-chilling systems rather than the spectacularly gross water-immersion systems to bathe chickens before packaging. Don't read this book near mealtime.</p>
<p>We eat much more meat than we used to (Americans, according to Foer, eat 150 times more chicken than they did 80 years ago), and we want it cheap. The only way to produce that much meat that cheaply leads to some very nasty practices. (I'll spare you the worst of it.)</p>
<p>Growing numbers of squeamish animal lovers have chosen to go vegetarian. Fine, you say, but vegetarianism is a personal choice.</p>
<p>Not so fast, says Foer, who sees modern farming as horribly corrupt and savagely cruel. He also raises the spectre of flu pandemics caused by farming -- think of "avian" flu and "swine" flu -- though he also suggests that many of the brief flus we catch are in fact food poisoning from contaminated factory-raised fowl. Apparently, the USDA regulations have been altered to dismiss feces in chicken meat as a "cosmetic blemish."</p>
<p>And then there's climate change: "According to the UN, the livestock sector is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions, around 40% more than the entire transport sector -- cars, trucks, planes, trains, and ships -- combined." And you probably don't want to know about the pollution from pig farming. A 1995 spill of pig waste in North Carolina represented an environmental disaster twice the scale of Exxon Valdez.</p>
<p>A reader is reminded of the debate over the first photographs from the Vietnam War. We don't want to look. Should we or shouldn't we?</p>
<p>Can one person make a difference? Certainly, he writes. Our food choices matter: "We eat as sons and daughters, as families, as communities, as generations, as nations, and increasingly as a globe. We can't stop our eating from radiating influence even if we want to." Or else he says: "Cruel and destructive food products should be illegal." These are Foer's conclusions.</p>
<p>You might not like being lectured on this topic, and Foer is not a philosopher or a logician -- so his arguments now and then veer into the shrill zone. For some readers, this will be the final straw, the book that finally makes you forgo the Thanksgiving turkey in favour of 10,000 other available dishes.</p>
<p>Oddly, the strongest parts of the book are those in which Foer recalls his grandmother, for whom hoarding food was a vestigial effect of the war.</p>
<p>"The worst it got was near the end," she recalls, "and I didn't know if I could make it another day. A farmer, a Russian, God bless him, he saw my condition, and he went into his house and came out with a piece of meat for me."</p>
<p>"He saved your life."</p>
<p>"I didn't eat it."</p>
<p>"You didn't eat it?"</p>
<p>"It was pork. I wouldn't eat pork."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean why?"</p>
<p>"What, because it wasn't kosher?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"But not even to save your life?"</p>
<p>"If nothing matters, there's nothing to save."</p>
<p>This is the kind of wisdom Foer hopes to pass on. It is</p>
<p>the kind of wisdom that, in all its humanity and clarity, deserves a place at the table with our greatest philosophers.</p>

<p>Canadians have chosen the inauguration of U.S. President Barack Obama over the recession and the H1N1 flu pandemic as the top news story of 2009, according to an Ipsos Reid poll for Canwest News Service and Global Television.</p>
<p>One in three Canadians (31 per cent) felt the swearing-in of the first black U.S. president was the biggest news story of 2009. A quarter of the 1,038 Canadians who responded felt the H1N1 swine-flu pandemic was the top story, while 22 per cent believe the global economic recession was the most important news story.</p>
<p>"John Wright, senior vice-president of Ipsos Reid, said the inauguration brought "a renewal of hope, which had seemed lost for almost a decade."</p>
<p>"H1N1 and the recession seem like momentary events that never lived up to their fear factor," Wright said. "Swine flu fizzled and the recession was an episode -- not the end of the economy."</p>

</p>
<p>An ailing economy edged out the H1N1 flu as the top news story of 2009 among Canwest editors.</p>
<p>A survey of senior editors at Canwest papers and Global Television stations gave the economic crisis the majority of votes at 53 per cent. The economy and recession beat out H1N1 (36 per cent) as story of the year in the survey, compiled in November by Canwest News Service.</p>
<p>"The biggest story of the year was the recession. It touched every aspect of our daily lives, our consumption habits, holiday plans, our leisure times and sadly, in many, many cases, the employment and well-being of our readers," wrote Gerry Nott, the Citizen's editor-in-chief.</p>
<p>"Many Canadians went through 2009 fearing for their jobs, if they kept them. ... We shopped less, saved more, took less flashy vacations, put off buying a car, cooked more," wrote Paul Harvey, assistant managing editor at the Calgary Herald.</p>
<p>Although there were signs of improvement later in the year, many Canadians lost their jobs, homes and savings. After reaching a peak of employment in late 2008, Canada's economy lost more than 400,000 jobs. Household bankruptcies skyrocketed. But the recession was milder and shorter than those of the early 1980s and '90s, ending with mild growth in the fall. The economic crisis also saw a crash in the auto sector in Canada and the U.S., with two major automakers filing for bankruptcy protection and taking billions in handouts from governments, while cutting their workforces and production lines.</p>
<p>"Although it is recovering, the economy was the lens through which most everything else in the news was viewed -- much as the 'war on terror' dominated the previous years," said Rob Roberts, Toronto editor of the National Post.</p>
<p>"Ontario shed much of its manufacturing base in 2009, suggesting some of these economic changes are permanent. And Toronto itself hit 10-per-cent unemployment, signalling its future as the country's economic powerhouse is very much at risk."</p>
<p>Dave Obee, editorial page editor for the Victoria Times Colonist, said the impact of the recession will be felt in reduced services and higher taxes for some time.</p>
<p>The H1N1 pandemic, which also dominated headlines in 2009, was the second choice among editors. It killed nearly 400 people in Canada and more than 11,000 worldwide. But a predicted explosion of deaths didn't happen, even though at times H1N1 clogged clinics, emergency rooms and hospital beds, putting a big strain on the health-care system.</p>
<p>On the positive side, H1N1 -- which appeared in Canada in April -- saw an unprecedented collaboration among the medical and scientific community.</p>
<p>While the economy and H1N1 received the most votes from editors, some also chose social networking, Afghan detainees and the death of Michael Jackson as top stories.</p>

</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>

</p>
<p>The crowds for the H1N1 vaccine have thinned, and the worst of the pandemic appears to be over. But since the number of swine-flu cases peaked in early November, the city's public-health officials have not let down their guard.</p>
<p>Of the 475 employees at Ottawa Public Health, 300 are still involved in pandemic response, with many reassigned to the vaccination campaign through much of this month, when the H1N1 virus is expected to re-surface.</p>
<p>"A lot of people say to us, 'Well, it's over, isn't it?' But for us, it's far from over," says Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's medical officer of health. "We haven't de-activated our emergency response structure, and I don't anticipate doing so until well into January, if not after."</p>
<p>For the city's point man on pandemic response, 2009 will be remembered as the year his department faced a number of stress tests.</p>
<p>First, the city embarked on its largest-ever vaccination campaign in an effort to beat back a new and highly infectious disease. The year also marked the first real test of a pandemic plan that had been in the works since the 2003 SARS outbreak. Then, on July 24, an intense rainstorm caused flooding in 1,200 Kanata homes, prompting 40 public-health inspectors to be dispatched to assess the health risks. The emergency took place as the spring H1N1 outbreak was receding, and plans were being drawn to cope with the virus's return in the fall.</p>
<p>Levy said the extra pressure from the flood was a reminder of how quickly multiple disasters could push the city's emergency-response systems to the brink.</p>
<p>"It was a very significant stress," said Levy. "If there is a second event happening concurrently with an event that's already consuming close to 100 per cent or more of your capacity, then how vulnerable is the community?"</p>
<p>To date, more than 40 per cent of Ottawa residents have been vaccinated against swine flu, with 300,000 doses given through city-run or hospital clinics. Another 119,000 have already been given by doctors and other health-care providers, or are in those providers' hands. A further 120,000 doses are sitting in storage, waiting to be used.</p>
<p>While demand for the vaccine is waning, in late October, when the first shipments were released to high-risk groups, the unexpected surge in demand pushed public-health workers to the limit. Even with 90 per cent of the department's employees reassigned to the vaccination effort, the clinics were still perpetually short-staffed.</p>
<p>On Oct. 26, the first day the pandemic vaccine was offered to Ottawa residents, the lineups were so long that within hours of opening their doors, the city's six vaccination clinics were turning people away.</p>
<p>That evening, during a midnight conference call with Mayor Larry O'Brien and city manager Kent Kirkpatrick, Levy pondered ways to speed the queues.</p>
<p>After that call, 140 city employees -- from departments such as parks and recreation, public works, information technology and human resources -- were reassigned daily, freeing up more public-health staff to perform triage and give shots.</p>
<p>While Levy and other planners had always counted on tapping city resources, much of their discussion had focused on where the vaccination clinics would be located, rather than how many people would be needed to manage crowds.</p>
<p>"In retrospect, maybe a lot of discussions were imbalanced toward physical assets rather than human ones," said Levy. "There were a few days when we were learning as we were going."</p>
<p>To get the vaccine into arms quickly, Levy and his deputies were forced to scale back on routine public-health programs and redirect, on any given day, about 100 of the 150 staff whose duties involved food inspections, health hazard assessments, sexual health clinics and health clinics for mothers and newborns. The tradeoffs were necessary because, like many public-health units across the country, Levy's department did not have enough staff and funds to manage its core programs and a pandemic response.</p>

<p>Post mortem on H1N1 flu,</p>
<p>Editorial, Dec. 30</p>
<p>Now that the H1N1 frenzy has subsided and the general public has forgotten to be afraid, the focus will be (I hope!) on analyzing how things can be done better in terms of delivery of immunizations and other pandemic preparedness strategies.</p>
<p>One thing I have never seen mentioned and which has greatly mystified me, especially with the tremendous push to get people immunized, is the absence of any consideration to hold immunization clinics for children in schools. This would have been an ideal and efficient way to address immunizing a sizable portion of the population without creating a great deal of inconvenience.</p>
<p>I would bet that many children were not immunized because parents could not take time off work, had no transportation options, could not manage multiple children being removed from school and transported at the same time, and/or had no family doctor offering the immunization.</p>
<p>An in-school immunization clinic would allow the maximum treatment of children, could be done class-by-class, and remove the impact entirely on parents. The clinic providers would know exactly how many people they would be dealing with in advance, and parents would have to deal only with signing and returning a consent form.</p>
<p>Such clinics have been done before in schools: TB testing used to be routine.</p>
<p>Why was such a simple, efficient option never once considered, let alone implemented?</p>

<p>It could be the end of the decade, or maybe I'm getting older, but it seemed that 2009 found a new gear and raced by more quickly than the years before.</p>
<p>The year started off with sales by all the cruise lines. January through March is the traditional "wave season," when all the cruise lines put their products on sale. This year, the cuts were deeper and the perks were better.</p>
<p>The wave season this year again will provide the industry with an indication of sales for 2010. It's only a first indication, as cruise lines are now offering sales throughout the year.</p>
<p>Consumers now either book early to guarantee they get a specific cabin, adjoining cabins, or to lock in at what they believe is a good air and cruise price, or they simply don't want to miss the chance to sail on a particular cruise. When the Queen Elizabeth offered cabins for its maiden voyage, it sold out in 29 minutes. Other travellers have a gambling instinct, and wait until the cruise date approaches in the hopes there will be further discounts.</p>
<p>Alaska had no sooner popped the champagne corks to usher in 2009 and celebrate its 50th year of statehood, when several cruise lines announced that many of their ships were not coming back to that state in 2010. Several reasons were given. The cost of doing business was too high in Alaska, and with so many ships in the market, the routes weren't nearly as profitable. Unfortunately for Vancouver, four of the ships not returning were based in our city's port. Some of those are heading to Europe in 2010, and some are relocating to Seattle, where operating costs are lower, mostly because it's cheaper to fly there.</p>
<p>The H1N1 vir us hurt Mexican tourism in 2009, and when the outbreak was at its worst, cruise ships would no longer sail there. On the east coast, those ships were quickly re-routed to Caribbean islands, while ships based on the west coast had more of a problem, as Mexico was the only destination for ships sailing the Mexican Riviera out of Los Angeles and San Diego. Those ships wound up sailing north and west until they were allowed back in to Mexico.</p>
<p>But all the attention was on Oasis of the Seas. This was to be the game-changer in cruising, and there's no doubt this floating resort is the high-water launch for the year. One report I saw indicated that of all the cruise lines stories written in 2009, 24 per cent of them mentioned Oasis of the Seas.</p>
<p>What to expect for the cruise industry in 2010? I'll write about that next week. Until then, best wishes for the New Year to you all.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The year it DIDN'T HAPPEN - 2009 was fraught with predictions of disasters that failed to materialize</b>
</div><div>Gwynne Dyer    </div>
<div>2102 words</div><div>2 January 2010</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>H11</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>The year 2009 was most notable for the three bad things that didn't happen. Firstly, the financial melt-down of late 2008 did not plunge us all into a 1930s-style Depression, although there were plenty of pundits predicting that less than a year ago.</p>
<p>As Stephen Schwarzman, head of the private equity company <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, said last March: "Between 40 and 45 per cent of the world's wealth has been destroyed in little more than a year and a half." But all he was really saying was that a very specific kind of financial bubble has burst. All the land and houses are still there and so are most of the factories and jobs.</p>
<p>There has certainly been a deep recession in the developed countries and the current slow recovery may be a false dawn: A "double-dip" recession is still entirely possible. Moreover, the vast amounts of money spent by Western governments to save the banks has left them with a staggering burden of debt. But the worst has been avoided and in the developing countries there was scarcely even a recession.</p>
<p>The second predicted disaster that did not come to pass was a killer global pandemic like the 1918 strain of influenza. Something of that order is probably still lying in wait for us down the road, but H1N1 (also known as swine flu) turned out to be much less lethal than was initially feared. Considerable credit should go to those who made a vaccine available much faster than was thought possible, but basically we just got lucky.</p>
<p>And the third bad thing that didn't happen? The same bad thing that hasn't happened every year since 2001. There was no mass loss of life (by which I mean more than 1,000 people murdered in a single incident) due to terrorist action in any Western country.</p>
<p>Even a relatively large death toll like that should not be a reason for any government to go berserk and start invading foreign countries. A thousand people is a lot to lose, but it really isn't the end of the world. A thousand people die of natural and accidental causes in the United States (to pick a country not entirely at random) about every three hours. Terrorism is different, of course, but a rational and measured response is still required. You know very well it would be neither rational nor measured. So we go from year to year waiting for the terrorists to succeed again on the scale of 9/11, knowing Western countries will go crazy again if they do. But it didn't happen in 2009.</p>
<p>What did finally happen at the beginning of 2009 was the long-overdue departure of the Bush administration. Almost everybody outside the United States, and many people within it, were profoundly relieved by that, but it imposed a huge burden of expectation on the shoulders of his successor as president, Barack Obama.</p>
<p>It has been a difficult first year for Obama, who presumably expected to have both his health-care reforms and a climate change bill through Congress by now. His problems with Afghanistan, however, are largely of his own making.</p>
<p>Calling Afghanistan the "good war" (in contrast to Iraq) during the election campaign was a useful tactic to deflect accusations he was too peace-loving, but now he's stuck with it. He has already ordered a doubling of U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan and he is now on a very slippery slope. This war is unwinnable and it could destroy him politically.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Obama does small but useful things that do not require Congressional assent, like cancelling the Bush plan to put a missile defence system into eastern Europe. Or at least that do not need Congressional assent in advance, like a new and better Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia (although that is still being negotiated). He even tried to launch a new Middle East peace initiative, although that was doomed from the start.</p>
<p>The Middle East, with only a tenth of the world's people, continued to generate more than its fair share of the news. The Israeli punishment attacks on the Gaza Strip that began on Dec. 27, 2008, continued through most of January, leaving more than 1,300 Palestinians dead. More than half of them, according to all estimates except the Israeli military's own, were civilians. Israeli fatalities from all causes, including friendly fire, were 13.</p>
<p>The Israeli election in February delivered Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader who had buried the Oslo accords in the late 1990s, back into the prime minister's office and any remaining hope for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal evaporated. Netanyahu is politically dependent on right-wing Jewish settlers in the occupied territories and would be most unlikely to compromise on their demands even if he were personally so inclined (which he is not).</p>
<p>So the 25-year dream of a "two-state" solution gradually fades and the prospect of a third intifada grows. It didn't happen this year and it probably won't happen next year either. But the Israeli military occupation has entered its fifth decade and another generation of Palestinians is growing up so full of rage they will confront Israeli power despite the obvious fact they cannot win. At the other end of the Middle East, Iran was hardly ever out of the news in 2009. The old question of whether or not it is seeking nuclear weapons stayed high on the international agenda, but it was overtaken by the new question of whether the present leadership could stay in power. President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad's implausibly high level of voter support in the June election ignited protests that have shaken the regime's hold on power.</p>
<p>If it is a revolution, it's a very slow-motion one: The protesters are not out on the streets every day, or even every month. Most of them do not even want to overthrow the Islamic system; just to reform it. But they keep coming out, most recently this week, and they are not deterred by mass arrests and systematic rape of detainees, nor by Revolutionary Guards shooting to kill in the streets.</p>
<p>This is the way the Shah was overthrown: by slow degrees, over a period of many months. It may not end the same way this time, but it looks like the same pattern -- and the best thing everybody else can do is not to meddle. Iranian protesters do not need foreign support and they certainly do not need foreign trade sanctions to be applied right now, because that makes them look like foreigners' puppets.</p>
<p>In Iraq, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki emerged as a genuine strongman, centralizing power in his own office, staffed by his own party and clan. In Afghanistan, another American nominee, President Hamid Karzai, embarrassed his patrons by rigging his re-election last August too blatantly, but they had to accept him in the end. And in Fantasyland-on-the-Gulf, a.k.a. Dubai, they could not make interest payments on some $50 billion in loans until Abu Dhabi bailed them out.</p>
<p>Europe had a quieter year (as it generally does). Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany swept back into a second term in September with a "dream coalition" that freed her from having to compromise with the left. France became the largest economy to impose a carbon tax on individuals and businesses using coal, gas or oil, with the explicit intention of changing people's patterns of energy use. The tax is US$24 per tonne of emissions now, but it will rise over the years.</p>
<p>At one extremity of Europe, Northern Ireland was threatened with a slide back into chronic violence, as radical Catholic groups who reject the IRA's commitment to power-sharing tried to lure the Protestants and the British army back into the fight by committing random acts of terrorism. At the continent's other extremity, the Georgian government was found guilty of starting last year's war with Russia by an investigating commission of the European Union.</p>
<p>The EU as a whole finally ratified the Treaty of Lisbon, which streamlines the operation of the organization to cope with a membership that has now expanded to 27 countries. It took eight years, two Irish referendums (they got the answer wrong the first time) and some face-saving concessions to the Czech president to get it through. The EU, it would appear, is still not ready for prime time.</p>
<p>The principal political events in Asia were the Indian election in May, which gave the ruling Congress Party a resounding vote of confidence, and the August election in Japan, which brought the opposition Democratic party to power after 52 years of almost uninterrupted rule by the Liberal Democratic Party. But there was almost no connection between these two elections in anybody's mind: Asia is still little more than a geographical expression.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Asia, the most important military events were the Sri Lankan government's decisive victory over the Tamil Tiger insurgency in May, which brought a 26-year civil war to an end, and the North Korean nuclear weapons test in the same month. The North Korean regime was mainly using the test as a way to blackmail the major powers into guaranteeing its future and those powers are playing along as usual. They have no choice.</p>
<p>Thailand is caught up in a deepening struggle between the poor majority and the old royalist anti-democratic elites, incarnated in the recurrent street clashes between the Red Shirts and the Yellow Shirts. In Myanmar, pro-democracy leader Aung Sang Suu Kyi, though still under house arrest, has supported efforts by the United States to open up channels of communication with the military junta. A military mutiny was successfully put down in Bangladesh in February.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, an amnesty this month for corruption charges that had protected hundreds of politicians including Prime Minister Asif Ali Zardari was overruled by the Supreme Court and the country was plunged into fresh political turmoil. The Maldives held a full cabinet meeting underwater in scuba gear to dramatize the threat posed to the low-lying island country by rising sea levels. The Nepalese cabinet, not to be outdone, held a meeting on the slopes of Mount Everest to dramatize the threat posed to the country by melting glaciers.</p>
<p>China's emergence as a world player continued, with attention focused in particular on its expanding investments in Africa. The ex-imperial powers saw this as neo-imperialism, but the ex-colonies themselves mostly took a different view. They understood China was trying to secure long-term supplies of food, fuel and minerals for a future in which it believed all those commodities would be scarcer, but at least the Chinese paid well and didn't subject their suppliers to hypocritical lectures on human rights.</p>
<p>A blow-by-blow list of all the things that went wrong in Africa in 2009 is depressing: a military massacre in Guinea, a coup in Madagascar, blood-drenched anarchy in Somalia, mini-wars between the police and extreme religious sects in northern Nigeria and much more in the same vein. But it feels less hopeless if you recall that most of Africa's 52 countries are at peace -- and that African economies have been growing at an average of five per cent a year since 2000, compared to only one per cent in the previous decades since independence.</p>
<p>Much the same observation applies, in a minor key, to Latin America. What little news makes it out of the continent tends to be bad: the brutal war between the state and the drug cartels in Mexico, the alleged threat of war between Venezuela and Colombia, the messy sort-of-coup in Honduras, and so on.</p>
<p>Finally, Copenhagen. The vast, 192-country conference on climate change in December was a total failure in terms of its declared objectives. There is no new treaty to replace the Kyoto accord. Even modest Kyoto-style national targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions were omitted from the vague declaration that was cobbled together by the two biggest emitters, the United States and China, on the last day. Neither are there any deadlines for further action.</p>
<p>If there is one thing 2009 is remembered for, it may be for the historic failure at Copenhagen.</p>

<p>In 2009, Journal photographers created about 100 audio slide shows and 175 videos to complement news stories.</p>
<p>Sound and moving pictures give photojournalists even more tools to work with, says Bruce Edwards, who captured all the thrills and spills from the 2009 Canadian Finals Rodeo on video. He chose a rodeo clip as his favourite multimedia element of the year.</p>
<p>"With multimedia, one of the things I like best about it is that you can put the subject's own voice into it," he says.</p>
<p>Read on to find out more about our photographers' favourite productions from the past year.</p>

<p>Journal photographers' top photos of 2009 / F4-5</p>
<p>Colour Photo: Brian Gavriloff, The Journal / In June,
photographer Brian Gavriloff and features writer Chris Zdeb spent a
night in the 24-hour Edmonton Veterinarians' Emergency Clinic.
Through the night, they saw injured magpies, emaciated cats, and
Bart, an eight-year-old Australian Shepherd who ...

Colour Photo: Ryan Jackson, The Journal / Last fall, Ryan Jackson and arts writer Elizabeth Withey decided to squash our worries -- literally. They wrote our biggest concerns, from H1N1 to
unemployment, on pumpkins and smashed them in just about every way imaginable. Pumpkin destruction via shotgun, cannon, dynamite, and even liquid nitrogen were all caught on tape. "I felt like I was
working on the Discovery Channel TV show Mythbusters!" says Jackson.

Colour Photo: Bruce Edwards, The Journal / Watch Bruce Edwards' Thrills and Spills at CFR video and you'll be thanking your lucky stars that there are fences between you and the bucking broncs at the
rodeo. Ugly as they are, spills are the peak moments of rodeo action, says Edwards, and set to music, they can be a lot of fun to watch.

Colour Photo: Candace Elliott, The Journal / Last January, reporter Jodie Sinnema and photographer Candace Elliott chronicled 31-year-old Lianne Hanson's journey through breast cancer treatment.
Elliott was by Hanson's side at home and in the operating room as doctors performed her double mastectomy. Elliott's photographs formed an audio slide show for edmontonjournal.comthat told Hanson's
story in her own words.

Colour Photo: Larry Wong, The Journal / Ed Kaiser was there when former television game show host Bob Barker made a high-profile visit to Lucy the elephant at the Valley Zoo in September. Caught on
video? A version of Barker's famous sign-off: "Control the pet population -- have your elephant spayed or neutered."

Colour Photo: John Lucas, The Journal / Not for the faint of heart, John Lucas's favourite audio slide show of the year tells the story of 29-year-old Kyle Rudyk's full-body suspension performance in
March. Eight hooks were pierced through Rudyk's skin to hold his body up in the air. "It was just so different," says the photographer with the iron stomach. "Weird and wonky."

Colour Photo: Rick Macwilliam, The Journal / Mechanical monkey bands aren't easy to find these days. So when Tim Moore, builder of gadgets and sculptures, took on the task of restoring a 50-to
60-year-old monkey band display for Whyte Avenue shop the Tin Box in November, photojournalist Rick MacWilliam made sure he was there with a video camera in hand.

Colour Photo: Greg Southam, The Journal / Chelsea Donelon was injured in a car accident in August 2007 that killed her mother and grandparents. Donelon uses a wheelchair but competes with the
Strathcona Lords swim team. Southam dived into the pool with Donelon in October to capture video of her training. "I feel very privileged to have a job that allowed me to meet Chelsea," Southam says.
"I admire her as much as anyone I have ever met for her ability to turn a tragic event in her life into something that has inspired many, including myself, to try just a little harder."

Colour Photo: Shaughn Butts, The Journal / To give readers a taste of Edmonton's premier mountain-biking terrain for the 21st instalment in LifeStyle's 52 Reasons to Love Edmonton series, we knew
Shaughn Butts was the photographer for the job. An avid mountain biker, Butts strapped a video camera to his bike and captured the roller-coaster ride that is one of his favourite trails in town: the
Belgroovy. "It was fun to do and fun to watch," he says.   </p>

</div><div>By Carol Sanders    </div>

</p>
<p>THE flaxen-haired toddler with a pink crocheted blanket was unconscious, alone and hooked up to tubes that helped her tiny, damaged lungs to breathe.</p>
<p>Family photos were taped to the glass of her isolation room window. Her parents, who'd taken her to the emergency room three times before she was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and diagnosed with H1N1, waited and hoped she'd recover. She had respiratory problems earlier and got off to a shaky start, health-wise, from the time she was born.</p>
<p>No one knew if she she'd make it.</p>
<p>Never mind ending up in better health than ever.</p>
<p>In the spirit of the season, call it The Miracle on Second Avenue.</p>
<p>In Stonewall, Michelle and Scott Myers saw their little Rhea recover from the deadly virus, then back at home on Second Avenue in Stonewall witnessed the healing of her previously damaged lungs.</p>
<p>When the H1N1 outbreak hit Manitoba, I saw the ferocity of the flu pandemic and the people fighting it first-hand.</p>
<p>A day at Health Sciences Centre touring the intensive care units with Free Press photographer Wayne Glowacki was an unnerving experience.</p>
<p>We saw a jam-packed ICU full of previously healthy people our own age with tubes down their throats, hooked up to ventilators in isolation rooms.</p>
<p>When I asked what the severe H1N1 patients were feeling, chief medical officer Dr. Perry Gray said it was the sensation of drowning.</p>
<p>Your lungs fill up and it's a struggle to take a breath.</p>
<p>Patients had to be heavily sedated and hooked up to the breathing machines. At times, some panicked and tried to pull out the tubes, one nurse said.</p>
<p>Hospital staff and administrators were planning for an onslaught of more H1N1 cases. People were working overtime, some were run off their feet.</p>
<p>The concern was, would there be enough health-care workers and ventilators to handle what might happen?</p>
<p>In the pediatric ICU, a dark-haired preschooler was only mildly sedated. She kicked off her blanket in her isolation room. "Sometimes she gets sad," said the nurse keeping an eye on her.</p>
<p>The unit was full of kids with H1N1 and was jarringly quiet.</p>
<p>We learned later that a child had died there earlier in the day.</p>
<p>It was not Rhea Myers.</p>
<p>Later, that summer, she was happily toddling around home with her older brother Alex and enjoying her swing set but still on supplemental oxygen.</p>
<p>In September, the oxygen tubes were gone, and she was breathing better than ever.</p>
<p>Her mom Michelle said one of the specialists told them the time she had spent on the ventilator had given her growing lungs a break, and a chance to heal.</p>
<p>"It truly is amazing to see her and realize what a strong little girl she is," Michelle said.</p>
<p>"The reality is that the outcome of her recent illness could've been tragic. If there is a silver lining to a child being that sick, perhaps being in the coma gave her body the rest it needed to heal and she has somehow beaten H1N1 and is now healthier than ever."</p>
<p>After weeks of bad news, there was a headline about hope and some very good news.</p>
<p>Thanks again, Rhea. Have a happy, healthy new year.</p>

</p>
<p>Jordana Simms woke in the middle of the night with the feeling her chest was being crushed. She was two months pregnant, suspected she had H1N1 – and her doctor's advice to get antiviral drugs was ringing in her ears.</p>
<p>When her breathing became more strained, she went to a hospital emergency room in Red Deer, Alta. There, she was given a prescription for oseltamivir phosphate, or Tamiflu, nipping H1N1 in the bud and putting her on the road to a happy ending – a pregnancy now in its 16th week.</p>
<p>“We're just really thankful for everything that happened,” Ms. Simms said in a telephone interview from her home in Sylvan Lake, west of Red Deer. “You can't ask for a whole lot more than good health.”</p>
<p>The 23-year-old is the quintessential non-story of the H1N1 pandemic: She is a health disaster averted.</p>
<p>That's because Ms. Simms received prompt medical treatment, encouraged by an initiative of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada. It recommended to doctors in October something so bold even their American counterparts had not suggested it: to provide advance prescriptions of antiviral drugs to all pregnant women.</p>
<p>“One thing that's good about Canada is the health system is different and the numbers are different as well,” said Vyta Senikas, associate executive vice-president of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, which received help from the Public Health Agency of Canada. “Certainly we're smaller so we were able to react.”</p>
<p>Pregnant patients are particularly vulnerable to severe disease due to H1N1. With obstetrical appointments typically being once a month, doctors were urged to write advance prescriptions, knowing antiviral drugs work best when taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms such as fever, cough and sore throat.</p>
<p>In Canada, 250 pregnant women have been hospitalized with H1N1, including 30 who were in intensive care and four who died, according to Public Health Agency of Canada figures from April 12, 2009, to Dec. 19, the latest available.</p>
<p>“They are at a tremendously higher risk for getting severe disease,” said Anand Kumar, a Winnipeg-based intensive care and infectious diseases specialist. “… The mothers overall tend to have a worse outcome and the fetuses are lost at a fairly high rate.”</p>
<p>That was certainly the experience in Manitoba. There, 27 pregnant women had H1N1, including six who were in intensive care; two of the six died. And the fetuses fared even worse: One did well, but another suffered severe brain damage due to lack of oxygen, and the remaining four died, according to Stephen Lapinsky, site director of the intensive care unit at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who, along with Dr. Kumar, is writing a paper on caring for pregnant H1N1 patients.</p>
<p>Treating pregnant patients can be akin to a medical high-wire act: While adults can tolerate low oxygen levels while on a ventilator, fetuses do not. Drugs to support a mother's blood pressure can divert blood away from the uterus and harm a fetus.</p>
<p>“It's a choice between supporting a mother or supporting a fetus,” Dr. Lapinsky said. “And the general sort of approach is to do what you can for the mother, because without a mother, the fetus is not going to survive.”</p>
<p>As for the SOGC initiative, it is difficult to know, as with any pro-active measure, how many pregnant women's lives were saved.</p>
<p>Some women, such as Tasia Coolen, who was given the prescription but never had to use it, felt better just having it in her wallet. When the vaccination became available, she got inoculated. And on Dec. 30, she gave birth to daughter Gabriella at B.C. Women's Hospital and Health Centre.</p>
<p>“I was happy to go see my family doctor, who talked to me about what the pros and cons are [of antiviral medication], and for me, it wasn't something I thought twice about,” said Ms. Coolen, 35, an infant development consultant in Vancouver.</p>
<p>For Ms. Simms, however, it was a lifesaver.</p>
<p>When she came down with flu symptoms in early November, she saw her obstetrician. At the time, her doctor was on the fence about whether to prescribe it, as it wasn't clear she had H1N1. If her symptoms worsened, her doctor told her to return or go to emergency as she would require antiviral medication.</p>
<p>Ms. Simms's symptoms quickly became more severe. In the middle of the night, her husband Tom Simms woke up the children – Kenyon, 3, and Nate, 14 months – bundled them in the car, and they all drove to the emergency department in Red Deer.</p>
<p>“You feel completely helpless,” said Ms. Simms, a retail store manager. “You are terrified for the life of the baby.”</p>
<p>At the hospital, Ms. Simms was given a prescription for Tamiflu. Since the pharmacy wasn't yet open, she contacted her obstetrician early the next morning, wondering if it was safe to take while pregnant. Her doctor told her to fill it. She did and, two days later, she was on the mend.</p>
<p>“Even waiting a few hours can make a huge difference on whether you can be … treated or not,” Ms. Simms said. “I'm glad we didn't wait.”</p>
<p>Now, the only waiting Ms. Simms is doing is for her third child, due in June.</p>

<p>Tasmania</p>
<p>Tasmania is Australia 's island outpost, a remote destination that's ideal for thrill seekers looking for the next big adventure. To see Tassie's jaw-dropping, prehistoric-looking scenery, embark on the 80-kilometre Overland Track, a five- to six-day trek that snakes between Cradle Mountain and Lake St. Clair through moorlands, forests, glacial lakes and jagged mountains. Between December and March, hardcore rafters can conquer the treacherous rapids of the Franklin River (a full descent takes about a week). Those who are fainter of heart can stick to the island's wine route and explore the emerging art and architecture scene. According to James Lohan of the boutique hotel website Mr. and Mrs. Smith (mrandmrssmith.com), sybarites won't be disappointed: “The just-opened Mona Pavilions in Hobart teams state-of-the-art rooms with a winery and a future museum, and the Saffire resort, opening in 2010, is eagerly awaited by nature lovers and serenity-seekers alike.” (Visit www.moorilla.com.au[http://www.moorilla.com.au]; www.saffire-freycinet.com.au[http://www.saffire-freycinet.com.au].)</p>
<p>Mexico</p>
<p>After years of being hammered by bad press about political protests, drug-related violence and swine flu, Mexico is primed for a comeback. The state of Oaxaca – home to the pretty colonial capital of Oaxaca City and the chilled-out surfing town of Puerto Escondido – made Lonely Planet's Top 10 Regions of 2010 list and Mexico City received a mention on Frommer's annual Top 10, citing that the city is “doing well what it's done well for over four centuries” as a cultural and ethnic nexus for Mexico and Latin America. David Lytle, Editorial Director of Frommers.com, adds that the capital is a solid destination for city-oriented travellers., with top museums, amazing archaeology, and perhaps the best food of any city in North America. And in case you thought the only accommodation options are all-inclusive, the hip Mexican hotel empire Grupo Habita has a clutch of chic boutique hotels from Mexico City (www.hotelhabitamty.com[http://www.hotelhabitamty.com]) to Playa del Carmen and is planning to bring modernist glitz back to Acapulco with the reopening of the Boca Chica on Caleta Beach.</p>
<p>Shanghai</p>
<p>On the heels of Beijing's 2008 Olympics, Shanghai is getting ready for her own clos-up as host to this year's World Expo from May to October. “The World Expo may have lost some of its allure through the years,” says travel blogger Keith Jenkins, “but the Chinese government is ensuring this one gets noticed with dazzling pavilions, mind-boggling architecture and state-of-the-art technology.” The event is expected to draw 70 million visitors and 200 participating countries, including Denmark – which plans to bring in a million litres of seawater and Copehagen's Little Mermaid statue for its display. Don't leave without experiencing the Shanghai skyline from a boat on the Huangpu River, says Jenkins. “You'll pass the stately colonial buildings of the Bund and the glittering skyscrapers in Pudong. The never-ending flow of boats that ply the river will keep you entertained if your neck starts to ache from looking up at some of the tallest buildings in the world.”</p>
<p>British Columbia</p>
<p>In February all eyes are on Vancouver as it hosts the 2010 Olympic Winter Games. With improvements in the Sea to Sky Highway and the recently expanded Skytrain zooming from airport to downtown in 25 minutes, Vancouver is ready for the influx of sports fans, athletes, and journalists. But the Olympics last only two weeks and B.C.'s real draw is its vast, stunning wilderness. To the north, the unspoiled archipelago of Haida Gwaii is Canada's Galapagos, an exquisite expanse of mountains, inlets, and old-growth rain forests with strong native roots and an unparalleled collection of vegetation and wildlife that includes whales, black bears, sea lions and some 1 million seabirds. The backcountry terrain of the Monashee Mountains and the more developed Revelstoke resorts are “it” spots for skiers and snowboarders. And with a vibrant restaurant scene in Vancouver and a growing epicurean community in the Okanagan Valley, B.C. is adding fine food and wine to its list of attractions.</p>
<p>Nicaragua</p>
<p>The Nicaragua of the 1970s and 1980s – a country associated with the Sandinista revolution and the scandalous Iran-Contra affair – has evolved into Central America's eco-tourism it-spot. It's less well-trodden than Costa Rica and Guatemala, less Americanized than Panama and safer than El Salvador. It has active volcanoes that can be climbed, hot springs that are suitable for soaking, pristine white sand beaches, and lush rain forests that cover more than 20,000 square kilometres of the country. And hotels are arriving, including the newly opened Jicaro Island Ecolodge: a luxurious environmentally friendly collection of casitas that's situated on a private island in Lake Nicaragua. If you tire of beachcombing and of doing sun salutations on the floating yoga deck, then take a boat ride across the lake to Mombacho Volcano and hike up to the cloud forests for some wildlife watching.</p>
<p>South Africa</p>
<p>More than 15 years after the fall of apartheid, South Africa makes history again as the FIFA World Cup descends on the African continent for the first time ever. While tickets and accommodation won't come easily (matches will be hosted in several cities in June and July), nothing compares to revelling in the festive World Cup atmosphere. “Cape Town will be the biggest winner,” says Keith Jenkins, founder of the Velvet Escape travel blog (www.velvetescape.com[http://www.velvetescape.com]). “The city's spectacular location, fronting Table Bay and backed by the iconic Table Mountain, its beaches, gastronomic delights, stunning scenery, and unique flora and fauna make it a dream holiday destination.” For a less frenetic experience, consider escaping to South Africa's rugged bushland. Hikers head to the scenic Drakensberg, a 1,000-kilometre-long mountain range, and the lunar landscapes of Vensterval Trail in Richtersveld Transfrontier National Park which is considered the country's wildest national park. You can also opt for viewing elephants, white rhinos and lions in Hluhluwe- Imfolozi Park, South Africa's oldest game park.</p>
<p>The 'Stans</p>
<p>We've been curious about them since Borat exposed his homeland to Hollywood. Lonely Planet founder Tony Wheeler tipped us off to the Central Asian republics' allure last year, calling them exotic, quirky and interesting. And even though we may not be able to pronounce them perfectly, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan are on our radar for good reason. These ex-Soviet republics are indeed unusual, a curious collision of a vast and diverse landscape, a legacy of harsh Communist rule and a history that's rich with ancient cultures, intricate Islamic architecture and nomadic tribes whose descendants still roam the land. Go now before the hotel developers and restaurant chains realize the potential.</p>
<p>Bhutan</p>
<p>There was a time not too long ago when Bhutan had no currency, no phones and no electricity. Until 1972, outsiders weren't allowed into the tiny Himalayan kingdom. But times have changed, and despite its isolated locale and seemingly archaic practices, Bhutan is now welcoming foreigners in its own way. Measures are in place to avoid overcrowding and to attract the “right crowd”. This is not a place for budget travellers: Visitors have to pay a minimum of $200 U.S. per day, and sightseeing excursions are limited to guided visits to stunningly positioned Buddhist temples – the Tiger's Nest Monastery hangs on a sheer rock face – and mountain hikes like the Jhomolhari Trek, which passes through remote villages. In the end, it's a small price to pay to visit the happiest country in the world, where people value Gross National Happiness over Gross National Product.</p>
<p>Brazil</p>
<p>Compared to well-trodden Argentina and Chile, Brazil is misunderstood. We want to samba during Carnaval and float down the Rio Negro, and yet we don't know much about the rest of this vast and diverse country. Future host of the FIFA World Cup (in 2014) and the Summer Olympics (in 2016), Brazil is inching its way up everyone's hot list, so you should get there before the tourist hordes. One of its best kept secrets is Fernando de Noronha. Only 750 visitors per day are allowed on this archipelago of white-sand beaches, windswept cliffs and colourful sea life; and they have to pay a hefty environmental tax for the privilege. For art connoisseurs, Sao Paolo's art biennal (bienalsaopaulo.globo.com) is the second oldest in the world – it returns this fall – and the sprawling Inhotim (www.inhotim.org.br[http://www.inhotim.org.br]) is a one-of-a-kind publicly funded cultural hybrid that includes a contemporary art gallery, sculpture park, botanical garden, and ecological reserve.</p>
<p>Laos</p>
<p>Off-the-beaten-path Laos is the forgotten country of southeast Asia. There are fewer tourists and fewer foreign influences than in Vietnam and Cambodia, which allows for less crowded and more authentic cultural experiences at ancient sites like the Wat Phou temple and in the capital city of Vientiane. Tony Wheeler recommends starting a Laotian adventure in Luang Prabang, the ‘capital' of the northern region which has fine old French colonial buildings, charming little hotels, Buddhist temples and monasteries and superb bars and restaurant. “It feels like one of those towns in Tuscany or Provence that are too cute for the postcards,” he says. In December 2009, China and Laos signed an agreement to build a cross-border nature reserve to better protect Asian elephants and other endangered species in the area. The reserve in Laos and China's Yunnan province will cover an area that is home to approximately 250 wild elephants.</p>

<p>The experts' favourites</p>
<p>BRAZIL: JAMES LOHAN</p>
<p>Uxua Casa According to Lohan of the Mr. and Mrs. Smith website, this hotel – in the fishing village of Trancoso in Bahia – is Brazil's coolest new green hotel. The owner, Wilbert Das, is the former creative director of fashion label Diesel. www.uxua.com[http://www.uxua.com]</p>
<p>LAOS: TONY WHEELER</p>
<p>The Laos Elephant Festival takes place in Sainyabuli every February. Wheeler, the co-founder of the Lonely Planet guidebooks, was there in 2009 and may go again in 2010: “If you've ever wanted to get up close and personal with a pachyderm, this is the place to do it.”</p>
<p>BHUTAN: KEITH JENKINS</p>
<p>Chimi Lhakhang Jenkins, founder of the Velvet Escape travel blog, suggests you take a stroll through the rice fields and along the trail to this temple, also known as the Divine Madman temple. The Bhutanese, dressed in their finest attire, bring their offerings to the temple every Sunday. M.S.</p>

<p>The economy may have been in a nosedive, but 2009 was a high-flying year for travellers. Cirque de Soleil founder Guy Laliberté spent $35-million to orbit the Earth wearing a red clown nose. And the Sultan of Brunei laid out more than $25,000 to fly in his favourite London barber, seating him in a private cabin so he wouldn't catch H1N1 from other passengers.</p>
<p>But it was also a year of high-flying hi-jinks for ordinary holiday makers, road warriors, airlines and the hospitality industry. To honour 2009's crop of wacky travel tales, here are the 25th Annual Travel Hall of Infamy Awards.</p>
<p>The Big Bang Award</p>
<p>… to a model, her boyfriend and an heiress, all first-class passengers on a Kingfisher flight from Bangalore, India, to London. Model Sarah Hannon fell asleep en route after drinking with boyfriend Daniel Melia. She allegedly awoke to find Melia fondling and flirting with a scantily clad neighbouring passenger, Guinness heiress Clare Irby. Hannah threw a tantrum and had to be calmed down by cabin attendants. Armed police boarded the flight on arrival and arrested all three. Commented a police source: “They certainly put the bang into Bangalore.”</p>
<p>The Spelling Counts Award</p>
<p>… to minions in the office of Stephen Harper. They issued a press release intended to say the Prime Minister would be making public appearances in Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut. But they mistakenly added a U, spelling the name Iqualuit. The PM's office later issued an apology when it was discovered the new word translates as a “Place of Many Excrement-Covered Bottoms.”</p>
<p>The Gene Pool Award</p>
<p>… to a Polish mother whose 13-year-old daughter returned home pregnant after a family holiday in Egypt. The girl didn't meet any boys on the trip, the mother asserted. So she sued an Egyptian hotel, putting the blame on its swimming pool, which is used by both males and females. The woman alleges the girl conceived because of stray sperm in the pool.</p>
<p>The You Can't Please Everyone Award</p>
<p>… to British tourists whose whines and beefs were compiled by the Association of British Travel Agents and Thomas Cook. One woman complained she returned pregnant from a holiday trip because she and her fiancé were given a double-bedded room instead of one with twins as requested. One woman griped that her soup was “too thick and strong.” Turns out she was dipping into the gravy boat. Other grievances: “No one told us there would be fish in the sea; the children were startled.”</p>
<p>The Rude Awakening Award</p>
<p>… to an inebriated Australian tourist in Queenstown, New Zealand. In a groggy state during the night, he got up without dressing and somehow wandered into a bedroom where a couple was sleeping. “He was a bit surprised that there were two people in his room and he was butt naked,” said Sergeant Steve Watt. The startled woman fled to the bathroom while her husband called hotel staff.</p>
<p>The Pretty Please with Pepper on Top Award</p>
<p>… to the American border guard who questioned Desiderio Fortunato as the B.C. man was about to drive into the U.S. “Turn off the car,” the guard barked. The Canadian man asked him to be polite and say please. As a thank you for the manners lesson, the guard pepper-sprayed Fortunato in the face, pulled him from the car and threw him on the ground. He was then handcuffed and grilled for three hours.</p>
<p>The Honeymoon's Over Award</p>
<p>… to a newlywed Saudi man who took his wife on a honeymoon trip to Malaysia. At Kuala Lumpur airport, the bride left him to visit the toilet. She returned to find her husband missing. It turned out he thought she was taking too long, so he flew home without her. At last report the woman was seeking an immediate divorce.</p>
<p>The Monkey-Business Trip Award</p>
<p>… to Davor Ivanovic, who had to spend his birthday all alone on a business trip to Zagreb, Croatia – or so he led his wife to believe. As a surprise, the wife arranged a live call to his hotel room from his favourite radio station. The phone was answered by a woman. Listeners heard the wife scream, “Who are you with?” The husband's reply, also broadcast live: “Why have you done this to me? We have kids.”</p>
<p>The Bad Habits Award</p>
<p>… to members of a Bristol, England, soccer club. On previous group trips, the men had dressed up as schoolgirls in Portugal and babies in Cyprus. But their luck ran out when they showed up in a bar in the Greek island of Crete, outfitted as sexy nuns in lingerie and wimples. They were charged with “causing a scandal by provocative acts and misrepresenting a uniform.” The British Embassy arranged their release, but not until they had spent nearly 48 hours in a cramped cell – still in costume.</p>
<p>The Noah's Ark Award</p>
<p>… to a menagerie of creatures that added extra hours to air passengers' journeys. <span class="companylink">Delta Airlines</span> had to delay two separate transatlantic flights on the same 767 because of a mouse in the cabin. <span class="companylink">British Airways</span> cancelled a flight for fumigation after a passenger reported seeing a tarantula crawling between his legs. <span class="companylink">Korean Airlines</span> delayed a takeoff so crew members could catch a sparrow flitting about the cabin. And a runway at New York's Kennedy Airport was closed for 45 minutes for the removal of 78 diamondback terrapin turtles that had moseyed in from the water.</p>
<p>The Close But No Guitar Award</p>
<p>… to <span class="companylink">United Airlines</span>. It was bad enough when its baggage handlers smashed the custom-made $3,500 guitar of Halifax musician Dave Carroll. It was worse when the service department gave his complaints the runaround. Only when Carroll composed a song called United Breaks Guitars and posted it on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> – where it became a viral hit – did United promise to do better. It failed. Just over three months later Carroll flew United again. He arrived safely. His bag did not.</p>
<p>The Employee of the Month Award</p>
<p>… to a Florida woman who tried to make amends after arriving late for work. Because of her tardiness, her boss was late setting out to catch his <span class="companylink">American Airlines</span> flight to Honduras. Fearing he would miss the plane, she allegedly phoned a bomb threat to Miami International Airport, then followed it up with an e-mail. Police tracked her down using her IP address and put her under arrest. The boss arrived in plenty of time; the flight was delayed for hours while authorities conducted a search.</p>
<p>The No Cans in the Can Award</p>
<p>… to an inebriated 23-year-old man with a powerful thirst. On an <span class="companylink">Air Canada Jazz</span> flight from Vancouver to Fort McMurray, Alta., he stole some beer from the beverage trolley, then tried to hide the evidence by flushing the empty cans down the toilet. The pilot made an unscheduled stop in Kelowna, B.C. where Mounties led the passenger away in handcuffs.</p>
<p>The Destination Wedding Award</p>
<p>… to German sweethearts Mika and Anna-Lena, who planned to elope and get married in Africa. They set out in the early hours of New Year's Day, accompanied by Anna-Lena's sister, Anna-Bell. Their suitcases were stuffed with summer clothes and swimsuits. But police foiled their plans after spotting them waiting for an airport train at a Hanover station. They were returned to their parents, who had no idea what they were up to. Mika was 6, Anna-Lena 5 and accomplice Anna-Bell 7.</p>
<p>The Flying on Empty Award</p>
<p>… to Japan's <span class="companylink">All Nippon Airways</span>. In an effort to reduce weight and save fuel, it asked passengers to relieve themselves before boarding. If half its fliers complied during a 30-day experiment, the airline estimated it could cut its carbon emissions by 4.2 tonnes. And that's no piddling amount.</p>
<p>The Lost in Translation Award</p>
<p>… to <span class="companylink">Aer Lingus</span>, which mistakenly played the wrong prerecorded message on a flight from Dublin to Paris. English passengers heard the correct version, which asked everyone to return to their seats because of turbulence. But the French message, which followed, said the plane was about to ditch into the Irish Sea. “The woman behind me was crying,” said one English-speaking passenger. “All the French totally freaked out.”</p>
<p>The Up in the Air Award</p>
<p>… to Richard and Mayumi Heene. The couple held global television viewers in suspense for five hours while their son Falcon supposedly floated over Colorado in a runaway balloon. But his journey never took place. There was relief worldwide when the 6-year-old was discovered hiding in the family attic. The parents later pleaded guilty to hoax-related charges after Falcon ratted them out. During a live interview with CNN, he admitted, “We did this for a show.”</p>
<p>The Please Bear with Me Award</p>
<p>… to budget carrier <span class="companylink">easyJet</span>, which refused to let 6-year-old Alba Peris carry her teddy bear on board. Because she had put it in a plastic bag to protect it from rain, it was deemed to be “excessive baggage.” Little Alba shuddered at the thought of her beloved Bebe making the journey in “the big, dark hold.” So her mother mailed the bear home. The airline later apologized and offered to pay for the postage.</p>
<p>The Family That Preys Together Award</p>
<p>… to Matthew Allen Eaton and his wife, Laura, who brought their children along on trips to a number of U.S. states. The kids made good decoys, the couple told “Dr. Phil” McGraw on national television, while the parents were shoplifting toys and other items. The Eatons collected up to $1-million selling the loot on the Internet over seven years, they confessed blithely. The couple were later charged with moving stolen goods across state lines.”</p>
<p>The Women Are from Mars Award</p>
<p>… to Miyuki Hatoyama, the wife of Japan's recently elected Prime Minister. Her tale of a trip to Venus 20 years ago is featured in her book Most Bizarre Things I've Encountered. “While my body was asleep,” she wrote, “I think my soul rode on a triangular-shaped UFO and went to Venus. It was a very beautiful place, and it was very green.” Her husband at the time told her it was probably a dream. As for current hubby, PM Yukio Hatoyama, “He would surely say, ‘Oh, that's great,' ” she wrote.</p>
<p>The ‘How Long Can You Hold It?' Award</p>
<p>… to a New Brunswick woman who told police she had been kidnapped at gunpoint and forced to drive to Toronto. Her captor never left the vehicle, she claimed. But when police became suspicious, she admitted the story was false and that she had made the trip on her own for personal reasons. It was RCMP Sergeant David Vautour who first cast doubt on the original tale of a harrowing journey. “I don't know any man,” he said, “who can spend 17 hours without a pee.”</p>
<p>The No Country for Old Men Award</p>
<p>… to two German seniors who changed out of wet and soiled clothes in full public view at a Brazilian airport. Responding to complaints, Salvador police questioned the men for two hours before releasing them to catch their flight. The men told the officers they thought it “was normal” to change clothes openly in Brazil, especially in a city with a beach.</p>
<p>The Best Performance in a Leaving Role Award</p>
<p>… to a Chinese woman who missed her flight from Hong Kong to Los Angeles. One might say she was a little upset. She charged a security guard, screamed “Aieyyahhhhh!” at the top of her lungs, then sprawled to the ground wailing. Someone posted her three minutes of hysterics on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>. Within days, the “woman going insane after missing her flight video” had more than 400,000 hits.</p>
<p>The Don't Leave Home Without It Award</p>
<p>… to passengers who blithely tried to carry illegal items aboard their flights. Among belongings confiscated by security agents at three New York airports were: a live baby alligator, a gassed-up chain saw, a two-metre-long African spear, a sword, drills, baseball bats, a shower rod, rodeo whips, fire extinguishers, 10-point deer antlers, a fully loaded 9mm Smith & Wesson handgun – and even a kitchen sink.</p>
<p>The So You Think You Can Fly Award</p>
<p>… to pilots at four airlines who were given suspensions. At <span class="companylink">Northwest Airlines</span>, two pilots were grounded for over-flying their destination by 240 kilometres. They told investigators they became distracted discussing company policy. <span class="companylink">United Airlines</span> suspended a pilot after he was arrested in London for allegedly showing up drunk to fly a <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> 767 with 124 passengers. Air India suspended two pilots and two crew members following a mid-air scuffle that spilled into the passenger cabin. And Delta clipped the wings of a pilot charged with attempting to run down police officers with his private plane.</p>
<p>The Fool and His Money Award</p>
<p>… to a German pensioner who drove away from a service station forgetting he had placed a packet with a large amount of cash on his car's hood. Realizing his mistake, he asked a policeman to help him search the roadside bushes. The good news is that they recovered almost all the currency. The bad news is they also found a receipt showing he had withdrawn the money from a bank in Luxembourg, something he had not reported on returning to his home country. The helpful policeman notified the customs authorities.</p>
<p>The Up the River without a Paddle Award</p>
<p>… to Demetrius Jones. Just days before his third birthday, the B.C. toddler drove away from his family's campsite in his battery-operated toy truck, dressed only in a diaper, T-shirt and sneakers. He manoeuvred the vehicle into the turbulent waters of the Peace River and floated merrily past log jams for 12 kilometres. Even when the vehicle turned over, he clung nonchalantly to the upturned axle. Following his rescue by police, he told his grandmother he wanted to go back on his “boat.”</p>

</p>
<p>ST. JOHN'S, NFLD -- jdoyle@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>Doyle. It's only a name. And then it isn't merely a name – not here in Newfoundland, anyway, where you're tripping over people named Doyle. Or “Dile,” as they say if they haven't been to university. I heard lead singer Alan Doyle of the band Great Big Sea say that. Said he didn't know his name was Doyle until he went to university. Before that he was called “Dile.”</p>
<p>This story is, by the way, an epic of Doyle. If you have a problem with that, you're out of luck. Go home now to your mother and tell her you want your name to be Doyle. And good luck.</p>
<p>When I land in St. John's after midnight, by the luggage carousel is a man holding up a sign saying, “Sean McGinley.” This is worth noting because McGinley, a distinguished Irish actor, is the co-star of Republic of Doyle, the reason why I'm here. The show is CBC's major new drama for 2010, the biggest TV thing ever made in Newfoundland and Labrador, and one of CBC's largest-budget series ever, with a cast of hundreds, all about a father and son private-eye team: Jake and Malachy Doyle.</p>
<p>Later, luggage retrieved, I'm staring at the Blackberry, as a fool from Toronna does. I glance at the man with “Sean McGinley” sign, and he approaches. “Are you Sean McGinley?” I assure him I am not and, if the Irish actor had been on the flight from Toronna, I'd probably have recognized him. “I'd better check,” the man says and wanders off.</p>
<p>I'm looking for a taxi when he next appears. “Have you something to do with Republic of Doyle?” I tell him I'll be visiting the set next morning and I'm from The Globe and Mail. This cuts no ice. “What's your name?” he asks. “Doyle,” I say. “Doyle!” he repeats, with exclamation marks and eyes wide as silver dollars. “In that case,” he says, “I'll take you wherever you're going. Mr. McGinley won't be here for hours.”</p>
<p>So the man, Jim, takes me to the hotel, where I check in as Doyle, like I usually do. There is a small fuss. I'm thirsty, you see. The mini-bar is as empty as the street outside. And the phone doesn't work. The latter is solved by use of the Blackberry. Not such a Toronna idiot, this Doyle. I call room service for a bottle of cold beer. “Oh now,” the man says, “I think that's all locked up. I'll call you back.” He does. “We could send you a draft beer,” he says. “Grand,” sez I, “Send it up, and I'll pay cash for it.” “All right, and what's your name, sir?” he asks. “Doyle.” Minutes later a young man arrives and, with a flourish, hands me a glass of cold beer. “A glass of beer, on the house, Mister Dile,” he says. Hasn't been to university, obviously. Never mind. The Doyles are cruising here.</p>
<p>Next morning, at an unholy hour, I'm sitting in a pew at Cochrane Street United Church. Beside me is a fictional Doyle: Allan Hawco, co-creator and star of Republic of Doyle. The shooting for part of Episode 11 of the series has just finished in the church. “It's a nice little romp about a missing horse,” Hawco says of the episode, “nothing heavy.” And that sums up the series, really. From what I've seen, it's fun, light-as-a-feather, old-fashioned TV crime drama. Jake Doyle (Hawco) takes small cases in St. John's – piddly stuff that inevitably involves fist fights and charming the ladies. Dad Malachy (McGinley) looks on askance but mostly eggs him on. The cops are not amused but one young lady cop falls for Jake. Shenanigans ensue. The buzz on Republic of Doyle is – this ain't The Border; this is fun.</p>
<p>Hawco, relaxed, is not at all like a man who has spent six months on this show, acting, writing, taking care of countless chores. Hereabouts, Hawco is seen as a kind of Laurence Olivier of the St. John's arts scene, co-artistic director of his own theatre troupe, The Company Theatre, as well as doing movie and TV work. He worked relentlessly, they say here, to get the province's financial support to make Republic of Doyle in St. John's.</p>
<p>In the TV racket, however, a myth has grown up around Republic of Doyle that it was a troubled series. There's nothing unusual about this. The Canadian TV biz is far from a charitable environment. Jealousy festers, and rumours abound. Here's the legend of Doyle: Hawco envisaged Canadian veteran actor Gordon Pinsent as the dad Malachy. Disappointingly, Pinsent is not available. East Coast actor Peter MacNeill plays Malachy in the pilot, but not the series. Irish actor McGinley is hired. Doyle goes into production in July with writer Denis McGrath (The Border) as show runner. McGrath leaves the show in October. Soon after, two others writers leave the show. Next, swine flu hits the set, and production stops. Finally, a storm shuts down production.</p>
<p>Hawco finds this legend very amusing: “Maybe it is due to the fact that we are so far away, and no one knows what is really going on. Truth is, this production has had more than its share of amazing luck. And people can guess or speculate, and I can say whatever I want, but in the end, as we all know, it's about whether anyone likes our show or not. I am hoping they do – obviously.”</p>
<p>On the Pinsent matter: “It did work out that he did an amazing guest-starring role for me in Episode 5. Gordon is truly one of my all-time heroes and idols. He has also been seriously supportive over the years and helped me a lot. I am willing to venture a guess that 90 per cent of pitches to every network in this country want Gordon in their show. But alas, he is a busy boy.”</p>
<p>On the McGrath issue: “Every production goes through all types of changes among the crew. … It's not personal.”</p>
<p>On the swine flu: “Oh boy. That sucked. I got it. It was nasty. We did have a few days delay, but I was able to do a rewrite on a badly needed script. In a way, because I was so sick, I was able to catch up.”</p>
<p>On the storm rumour: “That is really funny because it didn't happen. Other than swine flu, everything else has been business as usual and on schedule. Except my sleep.”</p>
<p>In truth, Republic of Doyle is, ah, very Doyle-esque – jokey, frisky. But it obviously owes a debt to TV series of an earlier era, and The Rockford Files (1974-1980) is often mentioned to describe its tone. True? “Rockford is surely one of them, as were Magnum [P.I.], Columbo, Banacek – Pinsent guest-starred – and all of the other 1970s/1980s cop/P.I shows,” Hawco says. “But so were Rescue Me, Cracker, The Mentalist, the first season of Californication, Prime Suspect, Law & Order and Life on Mars. I am a TV fan. And bigger than that, I am obsessed with storytelling.”</p>
<p>As seen in the show's advance material, St. John's is a major character and looks fabulous – it seems at times that the show is an homage to the city. How deliberate is that? “Republic of Doyle was designed to be set here – as I am from here and this is where Perry [Perry Chafe, co-creator with Hawco and Malcolm MacRury] and I conceived it. But it is so important to us that Newfoundland is not rammed down your throat. We want viewers from all over Canada – and the world – to feel this show is for and about them. … But I really hope people enjoy the elements that are specific to Newfoundland that might make the show special. There is so much inspiration and beauty here.”</p>
<p>Later that morning, I stand on Holloway Street under blue skies. There's a cold, whipping wind. I'm watching the crew shoot a brief scene in which that young lady cop (Krystin Pellerin), who has a thing for Jake Doyle, interviews some rogue. Hawco arrives and watches the scene on a monitor. I'm standing there taking notes, my hands blue as the sky. Hawco silently hands me two hand-warmers. Only a fictional Doyle, this fella, but decent, like a real Doyle.</p>
<p>The cast and crew then have lunch at Bishop Feild Elementary school, which has been commandeered. My interview with McGinley – who arrived safely after a complicated trip back from Dublin, via London and Toronto – takes place in the principal's office. A quiet-spoken, charming man, McGinley is a theatre veteran doing occasional film and TV roles. That's how Hawco knows him. “I was very taken with the stories and the sense of identity,” he says of Republic of Doyle. “I'd been to Toronto many times and was aware of how Newfoundland was perceived. A place apart. But arriving here I was struck by how utterly unique it is. People here don't care what the outside world thinks. They're comfortable in their own skin. The show reflects that. The place, the physical look of St. John's, is part of the fabric of it. And I love it.</p>
<p>“This show is outside my comfort zone. I'm the only non-Canadian and I've never done this accent before. … I didn't want to just slide into it, so I've had a lot of coaching. ”</p>
<p>Then we're thrown out of the principal's office – the boss of the school mustn't be a Doyle.</p>
<p>There follows, for me, little St. John's adventures that can only be revealed to a Doyle (or “Dile”). We're not snobs. Not snobs about Republic of Doyle, the show, either. It's light, a gambol of a show. Very Doyle. Doyle isn't only a name. It's a state of mind.</p>
<p>Trust me, I know.</p>

<p>My calendar's just like the cop</p>
<p>Who, when you feel the urge to stop</p>
<p>And contemplate some awful wrong,</p>
<p>Advises you to move along:</p>
<p>“Go forward, John, what's done is done,</p>
<p>The losers lost, the winners won,</p>
<p>The present perished in the past,</p>
<p>A feeble decade breathed its last,</p>
<p>And now time's progress sets you free</p>
<p>To sail your yacht, the Privacy,</p>
<p>To places where the passing year</p>
<p>Can't dash your hope or raise your fear.”</p>
<p>It's January's best advice.</p>
<p>But while it may be paradise</p>
<p>For Tiger Woods to hide away</p>
<p>From self-inflicted disarray,</p>
<p>A deadline poet can't escape The need to stop and stare and gape</p>
<p>At mesmerizing human wrecks,</p>
<p>Like superstars laid low by sex – The moment <span class="companylink">Nike</span> says they're gods, They roll the dice and tempt the odds,</p>
<p>And try to find the fatal flaw</p>
<p>That nulls our blindly given awe.</p>
<p>Let's move on, boys, there's nothing here</p>
<p>To remedy the bygone year:</p>
<p>If Tiger Woods can burn and crash,</p>
<p>The whole damned world is trailer trash,</p>
<p>And we've connived to seal our fate</p>
<p>With Octomom and Jon & Kate,</p>
<p>the Biggest Loser's tearful hugs,</p>
<p>Parades of victims hooked on drugs,</p>
<p>Balloon Boy's parents, bound for jail,</p>
<p>And all who've gone beyond the pale</p>
<p>To make us watch such bad TV</p>
<p>And think, “Thank God it isn't me.”</p>
<p>But even if we turn away,</p>
<p>Reality still makes us pay: By giving up our common sense</p>
<p>As Stephen Harper's audience,</p>
<p>We get to watch with vacant eyes</p>
<p>Our Canada cut down to size</p>
<p>By those who think we barely care</p>
<p>How tar-sands profits foul the air.</p>
<p>We hurt some Afghans, broke some laws?</p>
<p>Then sound the laugh-track, cue applause,</p>
<p>And bump debates for photo-ops,</p>
<p>Olympic flames and Timbit props.</p>
<p>So Parliament's prorogued, while we</p>
<p>Vacation from democracy</p>
<p>And put our civil rights on hold</p>
<p>To contemplate Olympic gold</p>
<p>On sleds and snowboards, skates and skis:</p>
<p>Forget those pesky detainees,</p>
<p>All you who seek sport's quick relief,</p>
<p>And blindly cheer the maple leaf,</p>
<p>For medals won on ice and snow</p>
<p>Supply that missing inner glow.</p>
<p>Pathetic, yes, but who can blame</p>
<p>Escapists worthy of the name?</p>
<p>The swine-flu panic stoked our fears;</p>
<p>The meltdown left us in arrears;</p>
<p>While fat cats grabbed their bailout cash,</p>
<p>Some mixed-up bomber thought he'd crash</p>
<p>A jet with just his underwear,</p>
<p>And gave the free world such a scare</p>
<p>That airports now resemble jails – Please give us back our fairy tales.</p>
<p>And so Obama's Nobel Prize</p>
<p>Delights those who avert their eyes</p>
<p>From seemingly unending war,</p>
<p>And Twitter's not a numbing bore</p>
<p>But one of life's most precious treats – Absorbed in sweetly mindless tweets, We leave behind our wasted rage And find a way to turn the page, Pretending that the coming year Can make our past just disappear.</p>

</p>
<p>Once again, The StarPhoenix's team of investigative journalists used methods we can't disclose to tap into New Year's resolutions made by people who graced our pages this past year. Here's a sampling.</p>
<p>Mayor Don Atchison: "This year I am going to deflect attention from the moving of the Mendel. Let's see -- maybe I can draw attention to what's going on in the lot across the street."</p>
<p>Premier Brad Wall: "I'm out of money, the potash gods have deserted me, everyone thinks my oil is dirty and the federal Tories have stopped flirting with me. Still, Saskatchewan loves me, and all I have to do is make them laugh. I need to find some more old-guy jokes to throw at Link in the house."</p>
<p>Finance Minister Rod Gantefoer: "That's it, no more using the Ouija board to come up with a budget. From now on, only multiple, dependable and scientific sources. Now, where did I put my Magic 8 Ball, horoscope, tea leaves, and chicken entrails?"</p>
<p>NDP Leader Dwain Lingenfelter: "It seems to work for that little guy to act respectful in the legislature. I'm going to try that. This year I will stop the personal attacks, silence the howling from my benches, raise only issues that are important to Saskatchewan and count only the votes that are given freely. And I promise to stick to my resolutions until at least Saturday.</p>
<p>Rider head coach Ken Miller: "Once again; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, thirt ... Damn! I'm getting myself an abacus."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper: "Ignatieff is in retreat, Layton is laughable, Duceppe is, well, Duceppe, and my caucus is too frightened of me to talk. I have prorogued Parliament so there are no pressing concerns to deal with, but I must find a way to stay in fighting form and lose weight. I'll continue eating Grits for breakfast, but I'll have to give up the gravy."</p>
<p>Federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty: "Man, what a headache. I can't believe I blew everything and then some -- I have even emptied the kids' piggy-bank. No more. I'm putting a lid on the spending. Unless, of course, Stevie wants something."</p>
<p>Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff: "No more threatening elections I can't force. This year, I am going to concentrate on that guy across from me and not let him get the upper hand. Maybe I should watch that intellectually inferior mob behind me to make sure it doesn't get any ideas. Harper, Rae; Harper, Rae -- I'll need a neck-brace."</p>
<p>Gov. Gen. Michaëlle Jean: "I look hot in uniform and I'm sexy even with seal blood on my chin. The Queen can eat her heart out."</p>
<p>Defence Minister Peter MacKay: "From now on I'm actually going to read these e-mails sent to me. Apparently, by some incompetence in my staff, I somehow missed learning about people getting tortured and I've apparently got engaged. I'll have someone's head!"</p>
<p>Diplomat Richard Colvin: "I resolve to read this rule book from the minister. E-mails marked urgent are to be ignored, so don't send them. The flak jacket and helmet are for committee hearings, not for Afghanistan, and success for diplomats in this Tory government is reserved for those without tongues."</p>
<p>Former Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Rick Hillier: "This year I'm going to go after those detestable desk jockies and scumbags in Foreign Affairs."</p>
<p>Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones: "Man, I look good in those ads. Too bad H1N1 let up before I became a star. This year, I resolve to come up with a more robust pandemic."</p>
<p>RCMP Commissioner William Elliott: "This year I'm finally going to get around to sending out that memo reminding members they are to serve Canadians, not Taser them."</p>
<p>Jim Balsillie: "If I can't have the Phoenix Coyotes for Hamilton, I will buy for my home town the Manchester United."</p>
<p>U.S. President Barack Obama: "I need a new slogan this year. For some reason people still think 'I can'."</p>
<p><span class="companylink">US Airways</span> Capt. Chesley Sullenberger, who landed his jet safely in the Hudson River: "The only thing left for me to prove is I can walk on water."</p>
<p>Afghan President Hamid Karzai: "I can't seem to run this government, the army is pathetic, the police are corrupt and I'm losing the war even with the UN's help. At least I know how to fix an election. I wonder if Ignatieff will hire me?"</p>
<p>U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden: "This year people will notice me. I'm going to sneak into one of Tareq and Michaele Salahi's social functions, have my picture taken, and post it on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>."</p>
<p>Tiger Woods: "From now on, I'm leaving it to my caddy to look after my woods and keep track of my balls."</p>
<p>Silvio Berlusconi: "Never in the history of the world has anyone been so persecuted as me. I need a break so I can stop thinking about all these young women -- I'm going to hit the links with Tiger.</p>
<p>Financier Bernard Madoff: "I have to stop taking advantage of people. I also have to come up with eight cigarettes so Conrad thinks he made a bundle by investing his two. I think I can get them from Bertram Earl Jones."</p>

</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the biggest news story of the year comes from Washington, D.C. with the historic inauguration of a woman as the vice-president of the United States.</p>
<p>Well, that could have been the news. But the inauguration of Vice-President Sarah Palin never happened. Nor did Michael Jackson's legendary "comeback" tour. Or Michael Ignatieff's dream of destroying Stephen Harper's Conservative government to become Canada's 29th prime minister.</p>
<p>As they say, 'the best laid plans of mice and politicians often go awry' and a lot of things that could have happened this year -- or were expected to happen -- never did. But some of these nonevents may have had an even greater impact on us and our world than the real events of 2009. Here's a brief look at some of them:</p>
<p>The worldwide flu pandemic . . . that didn't happen. In June, Dr. Margaret Chan, director of the World Health Organization, called a press conference to announce, "The world is now at the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic." It was going to be the "big one" that had the potential to devastate our economy and overwhelm our hospitals and medical resources. It may have been this very warning and resulting actions by medical officials (such as the creation and widespread distribution of a new vaccine) that saved us. Or it could be that H1N1 never was going to be "the big one." Either way, the sales of hand-sanitizers were the only thing that reached pandemic proportions and H1N1's impact on how Canadians live our lives has been, so far, relatively minimal. Things could have been very different.</p>
<p>The federal election . . . that didn't happen. One year ago, our country was in a parliamentary crisis and the political pundits (with the exception of Herald editor Licia Corbella who predicted an election-free year) were certain an election call was just around the corner in January. And then in May. Or September. Or not.</p>
<p>A global economic depression . . . never happened. Nor did every worst-case scenario that economists predicted for Canada's economy. Instead, worldwide economic disaster was apparently diverted by the investment of gazillions of taxpayer dollars. In Canada, it turned out that we had sound economic policies and we didn't follow the U.S. into high levels of unemployment, a collapse of the housing market and the insolvency of major banking institutions. Think about what our year might have been like if governments hadn't been so willing to spend all our money.</p>
<p>The U.S. finds Osama bin Laden? Never happened. OK, it's doubtful that he could have been found, since the U.S. seems to have stopped looking for him and David Letterman has stopped poking fun at him.</p>
<p>Iran 'unclenches its fist' and makes nice with the United States, as so politely requested by President Barack Obama. Ha! Never happened. While it's interesting to muse about how this might have changed world dynamics, the fact remains that Iran is creeping closer to becoming a nuclear power and has no intentions of unclenching its fist. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad just recently declared that Iran "will continue resisting" international deadlines for its nuclear program until the U.S. gets rid of its 8,000 nuclear warheads. So much for Obama's great plan to seek "a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect."</p>
<p>A declaration that the war in Afghanistan is over . . . never happened. Instead, our will to win is wavering as the loss of life and economic costs grow. The possibility of victory seems increasingly unattainable. The only way to win is to have the will to get the job done, and that means an increase in troops and a willingness to utilize the West's superior firepower. It's time to stop viewing the Afghan war like the board game Risk and return to the "shock and awe" that can get the job done. Taking away this haven for terrorists could have an immeasurable impact on the world's security.</p>

</div><div>Don Braid   </div>

<div>660 words</div><div>1 January 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Our wonderful friend Michelle Lang died Wednesday as a war correspondent, but she lived her final four years as a health reporter, the best I've ever seen.</p>
<p>Here in Calgary, Michelle became a quiet public treasure, a superb example of how the best journalists can be socially helpful without ever being destructive or mean-spirited.</p>
<p>It's entirely true to say that without her, Calgarians and Albertans would know far less about problems in health care than they do.</p>
<p>We take certain facts for granted -- the government's tendency to build hospital beds and then refuse to open them, for instance -- but forget that many of those facts came from one determined reporter, Michelle Lang.</p>
<p>I count myself among the many she helped. Michelle frequently supplied information that both helped and kept me more or less under control.</p>
<p>When a system failure was the story, we'd often spend more than an hour on the phone over several calls, trading tips and facts as we tried to get to the bottom of it all.</p>
<p>There were treasured moments when Michelle would completely belie her own tenacious image and the attack-dog stereotype of journalists in general.</p>
<p>I'd outline my theory of how the government had messed up the matter at hand, anything from emergency wait times to the abolition of health boards.</p>
<p>Michelle would listen with great interest and then say gently: "I think that's a little strong, Don. That part isn't the government's fault. It's kind of complicated. . . ."</p>
<p>Then she'd explain the complications in detail, and my column would deflate to some reasonable facsimile of the real situation.</p>
<p>There are few things harder to do as a journalist, especially in the understaffed modern era, than completely drop a story you've worked on for hours or days.</p>
<p>Michelle did that when the premise proved unfair or unworthy. No matter how tough the day (and colleague Bob Remington has described how very hard she worked), she remained a good-spirited, honest soul.</p>
<p>And that is why, Herald readers, you could trust every darned word she wrote. Like all the best journalists, she was a disappointed idealist rather than a cynic.</p>
<p>Many sick people benefited directly from her work. The pressure of Michelle's deeply humane journalism, always laced with the poignant stories of real people, helped move the province to fund two costly but vital drugs, Astavin and Lucentis, in 2009.</p>
<p>The Herald database shows that in the past three years, Michelle wrote nearly 800 bylined articles while contributing to many more.</p>
<p>She broke or helped break stories on health region bonuses, last year's self-awarded pay raises by the new board, H1N1 vaccination problems, the stifling of comment from health-care workers, and much more -- the list in the Herald computer runs to 68 pages.</p>
<p>Michelle made the government very uncomfortable, but she was liked and admired, too.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert recognized this with his gracious comment on her death:</p>
<p>"Michelle covered health issues with professionalism, accuracy and thoroughness. She was tenacious in her quest to inform Albertans, and for her diligence she was very well respected."</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>On May 22, Michelle won a National Newspaper Award, the equivalent of an Oscar in our business. She was deemed Canada's best beat reporter, meaning she's the cream of everyone who regularly covers anything, anywhere -- from courts to crime, schools, city halls, legislatures, Parliament and much more.</p>
<p>How fitting that our dear Michelle won the big prize in the year she died; yet how tragic that she died at all. The whole province is the poorer for her passing.</p>

<p>The legislature Speaker's office has ordered the Alberta Liberals to take down a website calling for the firing or resignation of Health Minister Ron Liepert.</p>
<p>Speaker Ken Kowalski said the site, liepertmustgo.ca,is an inappropriate use of caucus funding, since it singles out one MLA for personal criticism.</p>
<p>The Liberals took aim at Liepert during the fall and demanded his resignation over his handling of the H1N1 vaccination campaign and what they say is turmoil in the health care system.</p>
<p>The Liberals could host the website from their party site, which receives no public funding.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Electricity and other power plays; Capital Power bowed, Stantec surged and BSE ravaged in a memorable decade for local business</b>
</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>1364 words</div><div>31 December 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>There was plenty going on in the business world during the last 10 years. Here are just a few of the local stories that caught our attention during the decade.</p>
<p>City-owned Epcor Utilities spun off its electrical-power-generation assets into a new public company called Capital Power, creating the largest-market-cap firm in the city.</p>
<p>"Power generation has become a big boys' game, and we need access to capital just like our competitors," Epcor CEO Don Lowry said.</p>
<p>It marked the largest single privatization of city assets ever, and the biggest IPO in Canada in two years.</p>
<p>While industry experts were not surprised, the move was not without its detractors, especially those upset with city council approving it in a closed meeting.</p>
<p>The good news is the city will still get its dividend of about $140 million a year.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>When Tony Franceschini took the controls of <span class="companylink">Stantec Inc</span>. in 1998, annual revenue was less than $200 million. In his 10 years as CEO, the engineering and design firm grew to more than 10,000 employees across North America and the Caribbean with more than $1 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>Even during the deep economic slump Stantec was still profitable, and now ranks among the top 10 global design firms.</p>
<p>Franceschini, who retired earlier this year, and new CEO Bob Gomes believe Stantec can still grow its business by 15 to 20 per cent a year. And longer term, major overseas markets such as China and the Middle East beckon.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The leaking of major head offices from Edmonton included such longtime luminaries as <span class="companylink">Churchill Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">North American Energy Partners</span>, while takeovers of Lockerbie & Hole, Eveready and, just recently, Power-Comm, added to the dilution.</p>
<p>Edmonton Economic Development Corp. CEO Ron Gilbertson called the trend "really disturbing," while others noted the companies still have strong operational presences here, and others are rising to take their place.</p>
<p>Capital Power, spun off by Epcor Utilities, now ranks as Edmonton's most valuable public company, while <span class="companylink">Liquor Stores Income Fund</span>, K-Bro Linen and AutoCanada are among the larger publicly traded firms in the city.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>In 2003, a single sick cow from a northern Alberta farm kicked off the biggest disaster ever faced by the cattle industry.</p>
<p>And ranchers, feedlot owners and other players in the food chain are still struggling to get back to the pre-BSE years, when Canada exported $4 billion worth of beef and feed and other input costs were in line with cattle prices.</p>
<p>It took almost three years for the U.S. -- by far our biggest customer -- to allow Alberta beef back in, and longer for Japan and Mexico to follow suit. Korea is still holding out.</p>
<p>Exports to the U.S. are actually slightly higher than pre-BSE numbers, but the high loonie, rising feed costs and low cattle prices mean ranchers are losing money.</p>
<p>The pork industry, already reeling from low prices, had the added burden of H1N1, or swine flu, hurting exports.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>CV Technologies was a money-losing biotech company in 2003 with sales of $1.5 million and a market cap of $5 million.</p>
<p>Two years later Cold-FX was the top-selling cold and flu treatment in Canada, helping CV Tech hit $32 million in sales, $10 million in profits and a $400 million market cap.</p>
<p>The success coincided with company co-founder and chief scientific officer Jacqueline Shan being promoted to CEO. But only a year and a half after that giddy 2005, the firm was struggling with a costly failed entry into the U.S., and eventually settling investor lawsuits for $7 million and paying $740,000 to the Alberta Securities Commission for bookkeeping and disclosure irregularities.</p>
<p>Now called <span class="companylink">Afexa Life Sciences</span>, it is retrenching in Canada where Cold-FX is still selling well, and launching new products such as Immunity-FX.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Timing is everything, and when the suits at computer giant Dell chose Edmonton for a new call centre they couldn't have known it would become an empty $25-million building in less than three years</p>
<p>After all, River City was one of the cheapest North American cities in which to do business, had a young, educated population, and Edmonton Economic Development Corp. gave Dell a healthy incentive package.</p>
<p>But when crude prices started rising, oilsands companies rushed to build major expansions, and the labour shortage made oilpatch wages more attractive than call centres.</p>
<p>Dell's departure was part of a major savaging of Edmonton call centres, which hit a peak of 170 employing about 8,000 people in 2005.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>One plane crash devastating a company is tragedy enough.</p>
<p>But A.D. Williams Engineering lost founder Allen Williams in a Golden, B.C., crash in October 2007, and five months later his son and newly minted CEO Reagan also died piloting a plane near Wainwright.</p>
<p>The company also lost chief financial officer Steve Sutton in the Golden crash, with Williams's three-year-old granddaughter Katie the only survivor, thanks to her car seat.</p>
<p>Two top executives, Rhonda Quirke and Phil Allard, and contractors Trevor Korol of Ledcor Construction and Shaun Stewart of Jordans Flooring also died in the Wainwright tragedy.</p>
<p>Naseem Bashir, promoted to president after Reagan's death, said he was "absolutely stunned" by the crash, but the 185 employees showed incredible strength and courage in carrying on with business as usual.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>It can take the mountain pine beetle as little as a month to kill a mature tree.</p>
<p>So when the first of the tiny, voracious creatures migrated across the border from B.C. in the summer of 2006, all resources were mobilized to fight the invasion.</p>
<p>Three and a half years later it has killed millions of Alberta trees, despite more than $200 million spent by the federal and provincial governments trying to keep it in check.</p>
<p>Alberta Sustainable Resources Minister Ted Morton admitted in November that if this winter isn't cold enough to kill the beetles, money alone won't stop them from spreading into the Canadian boreal forest, which continues east to Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>

<p>Words like "Taj Mahal" and "white elephant" were used when the city's international airport went through a major expansion through the beginning of the decade.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of the project, the merger of Air Canada and <span class="companylink">Canadian Airlines</span> might have proved skeptics right.</p>
<p>Now the airport is going through a billion-dollar expansion to accommodate the continued growth expected through 2012.</p>
<p>In 2008 the airport led the country in passenger growth for the third year in a row, handling a record 6.5 million people.</p>
<p>It hasn't been recession-proof, however. A nine-per-cent drop in domestic passenger numbers forced the authority to increase the airport improvement fee from $15 to $20 earlier this year, the first increase since 2002.</p>

<p>Most people driving west of Edmonton are unaware of the hustle and bustle going on between Highway 16 and 16A in the Acheson Industrial Area.</p>
<p>The 10,000-acre park has quietly become one of the most diversified and fastest-growing areas in the region, with almost 200 businesses employing 4,400 people.</p>
<p>What's the attraction for businesses that range from huge distribution centres for companies such as <span class="companylink">Sysco Foods</span>, <span class="companylink">Kal Tire</span> and <span class="companylink">Navistar</span>, to truck service centres and a hotel?</p>
<p>The No. 1 reason in a Parkland County survey this year by was location, including being close to major highways, followed by reasonable cost of land, no business tax and availability of land, especially larger parcels.</p>

</p>
<p>As 2009 comes to a close, let's take a last walk down memory lane with some quotes from the top newsmakers of the year -- in Alberta and around the world. We'll give you the quote and see if you can figure out who said it. Answers are below.</p>
<p>1. "I have let my family down, and I regret those transgressions with all of my heart. I have not been true to my values and the behaviour my family deserves."</p>
<p>2. "It was the worst sickening, pit-of-your-stomach, falling-through-the-floor feeling I've ever felt in my life."</p>
<p>3. "I will take questions from the guys, but from the girls I want telephone numbers."</p>
<p>4. "I urge all Albertans to go out and get immunized."</p>
<p>5. "The message isn't any different today than it was four days ago. We would encourage those who are not at high risk to be patient and wait, those who are at high risk, please go and get your vaccination. Nothing has changed."</p>
<p>6. "The science says that we've got to significantly reduce emissions over the next 40 years. There's nothing in the Copenhagen agreement that ensures that that happens."</p>
<p>7. "I wish they caught me six years ago, eight years ago."</p>
<p>8. "No matter what Michael wanted, someone would give it. The very rich, the very poor and the very famous get the worst medical care."</p>
<p>9. "In the end, this is a symptom of a larger problem -- a bubble-and-bust economy that valued reckless speculation over responsibility and hard work."</p>
<p>10. "Ed Stelmach, you haven't even begun to imagine what's about to hit you."</p>
<p>11. "Albertans expect strong leadership out of their government and out of the premier, and this is an example of it."</p>
<p>12. "Men are attracted to smiles, so smile and don't give me that "treated equal" stuff. If you want Equal, it comes in little packages at <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>."</p>
<p>13. "I am a loyal public servant of the Crown who did his job in Afghanistan to the best of his abilities, working through internal and authorized channels."</p>
<p>14. "I want to correct my statement. The individual who was beaten by Afghan police was, in fact, in Canadian custody."</p>
<p>15. "Changes are coming."</p>
<p>AND THE ANSWERS?</p>
<p>1. Golfer Tiger Woods talks about his extramarital affairs.</p>
<p>2. Sully Sullenberger, the pilot who landed <span class="companylink">US Airways</span> Flight 1549 on the Hudson River on January 15 -- saving all 155 people on board -- reveals what he felt like after both engines failed.</p>
<p>3. Silvio Berlusconi, Italian prime minister, makes another of his quotable blunders, this one at a youth rally in Rome in September.</p>
<p>4. Alberta Health Minister Ron Liepert at the start of the H1N1 vaccination program in November.</p>
<p>5. Four days later, Liepert has a different message.</p>
<p>6. President Barack Obama on the outcome of December's Copenhagen conference on climate change.</p>
<p>7. Bernie Madoff, jailed financier and Ponzi schemer, in an interview with officials from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>8. Dr. Arnold Klein, Michael Jackson's dermatologist.</p>
<p>9. President Obama is angry at $165 million in bonuses insurance giant AIG plans to pay executives, even though the company was given a $180-billion bailout to stay afloat.</p>

</p>
<p>It began with Y2K and ended with H1N1. Here, in chronological order, is what some folk in this column said as the decade unfolded.</p>
<p>DO US PART: Specializing in divorces for high-net-worth individuals, MacLean Family Law Group principal Lorne MacLean recommended "giftwrapping an argument and placing it before the judge, not overturning a garbage can of arguments and making the judge pick through them."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>NO BANK YOU: Although he'd sold his Future Shop chain to the U. S-based <span class="companylink">Best Buy Co</span>. for $580 million, Inwest Investments-Wesbild Holdings boss Hassan Khosrowshahi worried that a photograph of him beside <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings</span> group chief executive Sir Keith Whitson, "will make it look like I owe a lot of money."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>JUST DESSERT: Learning that neighbour Bill Winspeer's 11th-hour $4.7-million loan would buy his feted but lease-expired Deep Cove Chalet on the Saanich Peninsula, Pierre Koffel interrupted a near-free final lunch for 170 devotees with: "The restaurant has been saved. You're all going to pay full f---ing price."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>THIS BUDMAN'S FOR YOU: Weighing further growth for the 200-store Roots clothing-chain he founded, Michael Budman said private ownership means "You take a longer-term view. When you're public, you have to answer to your shareholders. When you're private, you have to answer to your customers."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>KICK IN THE PANTIES: Sole director and secretary of a $500,000-a-year silk-lingerie enterprise she'd founded, Kathleen Staples blasted banks with: "All their talk about small business and women entrepreneurs is crap: A woman, online and in the clothing business -- that's three strikes against me when going to the banks."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>IN THE ROUGH: When Montrealraised movie and television producer James Shavick expected to have a free hand in L. A, he said distributor Arnold Kopelson told him: "Hollywood is like a country club. You're playing because I'm a member, and there are no out-of-town members unless they have a lot of money," meaning more than Shavick's $6.5 million.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>JUST DONE IT: He'd launched an online brokerage firm, restaurants, hair and photography studios, an auto-detailing shop, a record company and a band in which he sang and wrote songs, but Cris Jackson , 36, recalled: "Friends say, 'You can't do it,' when what they mean is they can't do it."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>NYET WORTH: Fretting over the B.C. Liquor Control and Licensing Branch's "culture of enforcement," Barwatch chair and 38-year hospitality professional John Teti greeted a Calgary-based operator with: "You coming from Alberta to open a bar in Vancouver is like me going to Moscow to open one."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>QUEEN FOR TODAY: Recalling a day when three-decade business partner and Bryan Adams and Michael Buble manager Bruce Allen was yelling "I'm the f---ing king of Vancouver," fellow showbiz mogul Sam Feldman smilingly said: "I should have asked myself: 'Do kings have partners?'"</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>CHATEAU VAN GOGH: Having sold his Beringer Blass wine-producing firm to Australian beverage colossus Foster's, Yellow Tail brand founder Wolf Blass endorsed New Zealandraised winemaker John Simes's efforts at Anthony von Mandl's Mission Hill Estate Winery in the Okanagan Valley with: "You have to be an artist. You have to be different. Sometimes they call it madness."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>HIGHER GRADE: Howe Streeters reached for their space suits when University of B.C. astronomy professor Jaymie Matthews predicted travel to "asteroids with surfaces covered with elements like platinum, titanium and gold that we have to dig for, often through solid rock, but [there] you'd only have to scrape the surface."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>PICTURE IMPERFECT: <span class="companylink">Ernst & Young</span> entertainment-business specialist Neil Clarance carefully linked Canadian moviemaking's endemic lack of private capitalization to governmental funding agencies "adhering to a cultural mandate, and that has not necessarily translated into commercial viability and profit." Since almost none of them budget Hollywood's further 50 to 100 per cent of production costs to sales and marketing, "When I suggest to my kids that we go and see one of those good Canadian films, they say: 'I haven't seen an ad for it.'"</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>FORTY-OUNCE WINKS: Flying home directly after transpacific meetings, philanthropist, cultural heavy and Polygon Group chair Michael Audain said he downs three large glasses of red wine, after which "I get a better sleep in <span class="companylink">Cathay Pacific</span> business class than I do in my bed at home."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>AIR SMILES: Ironwood Dental Centre principal and frequent flyer Dr. Sheena Sood had the same rule for global travel as for her practice: "Why go economy when there's first class?"</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>PROWLER PROOFING: "We're not solving crime," said Michael Jagger, who forfeited police career plans to found the fast-response, ever-patrolling Provident Security & Event Management Corp. "We're giving [thieves] a good reason to stay away."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>POWER PALS: About to be ranked 27th in Vancouver magazine's Power 50 rating of influential folk, Canaccord brokerage firm founder Peter Brown murmured cheerily to Vancouver Sun investment-biz columnist David Baines, who would place 25th: "If you're on this list, the province is in trouble."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>POO U: As his Armstrong Hospitality Group carried Rocky Mountaineer train passengers in sybaritic comfort, Peter Armstrong remembered a summer job that met his father David's character-building demands:</p>
<p>"Sorting a half-ton of soiled diapers, checking them for worms and having them ready to go again by morning."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>LIVE AND ARRIVED: With his Sudden Death Records firm releasing 100 albums, many by his three-decade punk band, D.O.A., Joe (Shithead) Keithley said his life plan remained: "Be your own boss, take control of your life, and try to do something to achieve positive change in the world." As for the GMC-powered 1988 Grumman Curbmaster step-van parked beside his palatial home: "The number one asset of a band is a reliable vehicle."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>WELL DONE: After spending $8 million to develop the 275-seat Shore Club restaurant when $6 million might have sufficed, Keg steakhouse chain head David Aisenstat said: "This is a world-class city, so why not have world-class places?"</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>CREASE CLINIC: Junior A hockey goaltending developed his business skills, said five-restaurant Points West firm partner, Rob Ward: "It helps you see the play developing so you can be one or two plays ahead."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>BABY STEPS: Asked what additions he'd make to operations involving 29,000 employees handling $6.3-billion-worth of sales yearly from 400 locations in 11 countries, city-based Jim Pattison said: "Hopefully, a lot. We're just getting started, Malcolm."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>NO NOON, BIG BOON: An accountant's opinion that closing for lunch would affect dinner business was dead on, said Kitsilano restaurateur John Bishop: "Our dinner business went up, and we became more profitable."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>BREAKING NEWS : Before launching his Tofino-Ucluelet-Pemberton-Port Moody radio network, classic entrepreneur Matthew McBride faced assenting wife Caroline with: "Honey, I'd like to take all the money we have, borrow a whole bunch on our credit cards, and start a radio station out on the west coast of Vancouver Island."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>SECOND NATURE: Hydaburgborn Dorothy Grant said she and cousin Gina Mae Schubert are innate designer-entrepreneurs "because Haida have always had an ample supply of food and everything else. We've had a sense of abundance about us."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>WAVE HELLO: Founding the Blo Blow Dry Bar hair-styling chain, which does no cutting, Judy Brooks comforted clients with: "You're not cheating on your hairdresser."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>MY TIME: When premium-priced watches stayed buoyant in the recession, Palladio jewelry firm principal Flora Bosa said: "I think it's men who consider them as investments, so they treat themselves before they treat their wives."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>WHAT A KICK: After a London Air Services Lear 45 XRS business jet got him to Chicago in 130 minutes, company president Wynne Powell, who also heads parent London Drugs, said: "It's like tieing a rocket to your ass."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>MAYBE BABY: Asked if he owned the <span class="companylink">Shaw Communications</span> firm (he doesn't), Robert Shaw, who is a nephew of Hong Kong showbiz mogul Sir Run Run Shaw, replied: "Let me look."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>HONEY, I'M HOME: Farris, Vaughn, Wills & Murphy senior partner James Hatton, who may be Canada's only lawyer specializing in the $100-million-range process of developing marketable drugs, spends off-hours as an apiarist, "interested in the harsh, medieval nature of bees, where drones are killed and the queen mates once and is kept in the dark for the rest of her life."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Here's wishing better than that for you in the decade ahead.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Defined by terrorism, remembered in tears; The first decade of the 21st century was not the best of times -- it's been dubbed everything from The Uh-Oh Decade to the Decade from Hell. Sheldon Alberts reviews the tumultuous times.</b>
</div><div>Sheldon Alberts   </div>

</p>
<p>The 620th day of the new decade began like most others for Kyle Conley, with all the familiar routines of life unfolding as usual.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old financial systems analyst dropped his daughter off at daycare near his home in Arlington, Virginia, then started the stop-and-go commute to his job in downtown Washington.</p>
<p>A new father who would soon learn his wife was expecting their second child, Conley had a comfortable home, a promising career and -- like so many millions of others in the western world -- every reason to believe the relative peace and prosperity of the time would continue uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Then, just around 9:40 a.m., as he was crossing the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge over the Potomac River, Conley glanced up to see the brilliant blue September sky blighted by a plume of black smoke rising above the Pentagon.</p>
<p>In lower Manhattan, the twin towers were already engulfed in flames and nearing collapse.</p>
<p>Although he didn't know it at the time, Conley's future had been forever altered, and along with it the arc of a suddenly tumultuous decade.</p>
<p>"Looking back, I don't remember having any particular concerns about what was going on in the world at the time, or being concerned with things outside my own personal life," Conley says now.</p>
<p>"That all changed on Sept. 11. I realized for the first time that we are vulnerable to attack from overseas, that even close to home, awful things can happen."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Conley's reaction rings true for anyone who experienced terrorism up close in the past decade, whether in London or Madrid, Bali or Baghdad, Mumbai or Moscow, Kandahar or Kabul.</p>
<p>As 2009 draws to an unsettling close, what's surprising is that no one agrees on what to name the 10-year period that is passing into history. It has been called "The Aughts," the "Naughty Aughties" and even the "Uh-Oh Decade," a favourite among cheekier historians. Time magazine took a dimmer view in November by dubbing it "The Decade from Hell."</p>
<p>This much is certain. It was a decade marked by a demarcation line so clear and jarring -- before and after the 9/11 hijackings -- that one strains to recall the world as it was when the calendar flipped from 1999 to 2000.</p>
<p>"The emergence of stateless terrorism as a major international threat will go down as the defining event, without question," says Julian Zelizer, a history professor at Princeton University. "It cemented terrorism as the No. 1 national security issue, not just for the United States but for so many countries. It's not a threat that will dissipate anytime soon."</p>
<p>With 10 years of memory providing a kaleidoscope of perspective, it seems almost comical that the decade opened with the planet gripped by anxiety about impending technological chaos.</p>
<p>The dreaded Y2K computer threat came and went with a whimper, not a bang. Personal computers did not crash. Banking systems did not fail. Satellites did not fall from their orbits. It was the Chicken Little of international crises, a millennial false alarm.</p>
<p>Before 9/11, it was conventional wisdom this would be the decade of American empire, with the world's lone 'hyperpower' becoming even more omnipotent in its global influence.</p>
<p>America had moments of triumph, none more powerful than Barack Obama's election as the first black president of a nation whose history was forged by slavery. But the Sept. 11 attacks eclipsed Obama's election in their sheer world-shaking magnitude, ushering in a decade of American vulnerability that created ripple effects worldwide.</p>
<p>It was in some ways a decade when fear -- of suitcase nukes, of melting polar ice caps, of pandemic viruses and nail clippers on airplanes -- held firm grip over entire populations. And in the way most of us experienced the 9/11 attacks -- first on live TV, then repeated in an endless digital loop -- they presaged an era when technology would make the world, and all of its tragedy, hope and despair, a much smaller place.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>As an American, Kyle Conley was so angered by 9/11 that he put his civilian life on hold to join the U.S. Marine Corps reserves. He left his job and his pregnant wife in January 2002 for boot camp in Parris Island, South Carolina, thinking he would eventually be deployed to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>"I recognized the need for people to go out on the front lines and risk our lives to get the bad guys, and be part of a larger effort to create a homeland where this wouldn't occur again," he says.</p>
<p>Whatever sense -- or hope -- of global security that emerged at the end of the Cold War was lost on 9/11.</p>
<p>"I was in my 20s when the Cold War faded way. Things looked a little rosier," Conley says.</p>
<p>"There weren't really major conflicts on the horizon. It is kind of naive in hindsight. I was like the average person who saw 9/11 as sort of out of the blue."</p>
<p>By the time Conley's unit was activated, the Taliban had fallen and then U.S. president George W. Bush's attention shifted from Afghanistan. Full of presidential hubris and armed with faulty intelligence, the U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003.</p>
<p>Conley's light armoured battalion was at the tip of the spear, leading reconnaissance patrols as U.S. forces advanced toward Baghdad.</p>
<p>He returned safely to the U.S. in August 2003, only to be deployed again in 2006. Conley spent a second Iraq tour in a riverine boat patrolling the Euphrates River from Ramadi to the Syrian border.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>From the start of the war on terror to the end of the Great Recession, much of the past decade's history can be written through the prism of an America thrown off kilter.</p>
<p>"It was the decade when the United States lost its confidence, militarily and economically," says Zelizer.</p>
<p>More than eight years after toppling the Taliban, the insurgents continue fighting and the war in Afghanistan is about to escalate.</p>
<p>In Iraq, U.S. combat forces will leave only in August, more than seven years after Bush first declared an end to major combat operations.</p>
<p>"Whether you were for the Iraq war or against it, it really raised questions about what the U.S. is capable of doing to combat the threats that the country faces now," Zelizer says. "We can get bogged down now just as easily as in the 1960s."</p>
<p>There were other consequences to America's shattered sense of security after 9/11. For Canadians, the world's longest undefended border is a line you can no longer cross without a passport. Unmanned aerial drones patrol the frontier.</p>
<p>Extraordinary rendition and Guantanamo were also the fallout of post-9/11 American insecurity, producing stress fractures in the relationship between America, Europe and the Arab world.</p>
<p>On the economic front, the past decade revealed an underlying U.S. weakness that caught other nations by surprise. Wall Street's indulgence in risky mortgage securities led to the near-collapse of the nation's banking industry in the fall of 2008, sparking a global recession. The once-mighty U.S. dollar has beaten a steady retreat, while the national debt has surged above $12 trillion.</p>
<p>The bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler highlighted U.S. industrial decline.</p>
<p>"America went into the decade as the great victor from the Cold War. There was a combination of self-righteousness and a sense of power. Both of those have been lost," says Gil Troy, a history professor at McGill University.</p>
<p>"The two biggest traumas of the decade -- 9/11 and the economic meltdown -- hit America very personally, where it hurts. You have a country that has been knocked down a peg or two."</p>
<p>Even American democracy was showing wear and tear. The presidential vote of 2000 introduced "dimpled chads" into the global democratic lexicon and put George W. Bush in the White House, but only after 36 days of indecision that exposed significant flaws in the U.S. electoral system.</p>
<p>At no moment did America seem more uncertain of itself than in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the flooding of New Orleans.</p>
<p>"Katrina was very traumatic. It totally exposed the limits of what public policy could accomplish in this country," says Zelizer.</p>
<p>"You had this city devastated and essentially all levels of government failed."</p>
<p>As America suffered, China rose. Now the world's third-largest and still fastest-growing economy, China survived the global recession in far better health than nations in the West. China endured its own national disaster -- the Sichuan earthquake, which killed tens of thousands -- but it also threw its international coming-out party with the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</p>
<p>"The rise of China didn't start in 2000 or 2001, but this was the decade that it became clearer we are dealing with a very formidable economic force," says Zelizer. "They have a kind of economic power that all countries, including the United States, will have to reckon with in the next few years."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Did we mention it was the decade of fear?</p>
<p>In 2006, bird flu was going to spread across oceans from Hong Kong and sicken millions. The H1N1 virus prompted the largest immunization program in history, and the lineups for vaccines in Canada and the United States underscored the collective international angst.</p>
<p>North Americans learned their seaports were so porous that nuclear weapons could be smuggled in container ships without detection. In the U.S., the new normal meant deciphering colour-coded terror alerts and worrying about anthrax in the mail. The U.S. got Saddam Hussein, but Osama bin Laden remains a phantom threat.</p>
<p>The fear "started in some ways with the Y2K scare," says Troy. "In the era of 24/7 media, there is this chain of transmission that leads to hysteria and, in some ways, our worst expectations keep on not being met."</p>
<p>Except when it was justified. Terrorism aside, there was little in the past decade to ease anxiety about the broader state of global security. In Darfur, genocide claimed the lives of several hundred thousand people. AIDS was the health crisis of the decade, sweeping silently across Africa and killing millions.</p>
<p>North Korea test fired nuclear devices in 2006 and 2009, and Iran remained defiant in the development of its own atomic weapons program. The Israeli-Palestinian situation continues to fester. In each case, international diplomacy mostly failed to lower the threat.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>The Sept. 11 attacks were the most traumatic act of violence ever broadcast on live TV. But the Internet quickly brought other calamities closer to home. The 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean killed more than 230,000 people, horror enough. But handheld <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> videos showing the giant waves crashing ashore in Thailand and Indonesia created a near-instant global awareness of nature's force and its human toll.</p>
<p>When NBC journalist Tim Russert died of a heart attack at his office in 2008, the story broke on Wikipedia before being announced on his own network. Bad news never travelled faster.</p>
<p>But neither did celebratory news. People attending Obama's historic inauguration shared their feelings about the experience 140 characters at a time on a revolutionary site called Twitter.</p>
<p>The advances in Internet technology democratized communication in a way that may have profound geopolitical consequences, Zelizer says.</p>
<p>Twitter, for example, became the technology of choice for Iranians to tell the world about street demonstrations following last June's election. The shooting of Iranian protester Neda Soltan in 2009 was captured on video and broadcast on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, generating global awareness of the regime's crackdown. "It was in this decade that the total sweep of the Internet really changed peoples' lives," Zelizer says. "It is having a dramatic effect around the spread of proto-democratic sentiment emerging in authoritarian countries. A government can try to control it but it will be very hard to do so."</p>

<p>The decade closes with a bookend to Sept. 11, 2001, as 30,000 American troops prepare for deployment to the war launched in response to those attacks. Ominously, passengers and crew of <span class="companylink">Northwest Airlines</span> flight 253 with almost 300 people aboard had to overpower a passenger after he ignited an explosive device attached to his body as the aircraft as it approached Detroit from Amsterdam on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Conley, now 40 and the father of three, is on inactive reserve and working in Washington with the same company that employed him on 9/11. His old Marine unit is back in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Deciding to enlist was "one of the best decisions I ever made," he says, and part of him wishes he were in Afghanistan with his buddies.</p>
<p>For all that has happened since then, Conley believes the U.S. and the world are more secure today, even though unfinished business remains.</p>
<p>"In 2001, did I think in 2009 that we wouldn't get bin Laden? No," he says. "I thought there was no chance he'd still be out there."</p>

<div>EDITORIAL</div>
<div id="hd"><b>2009: Really bad things didn't happen</b>
</div><div>Gwynne Dyer   </div>
<div>737 words</div><div>31 December 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>The year 2009 was most notable for the three bad things that didn't happen. First, the financial melt-down of late 2008 did not plunge us all into a 1930s-style depression, although there were plenty of pundits predicting that less than a year ago.</p>
<p>As Stephen Schwarzman, head of the private equity company <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, said last March: "Between 40 and 45 per cent of the world's wealth has been destroyed in little more than a year and a half." But all he was really saying was that a very specific kind of financial bubble has burst. All the land and houses are still there, and so are most of the factories and jobs.</p>
<p>There has certainly been a deep recession in the developed countries, and the current slow recovery may be a false dawn: a "double-dip" recession is still entirely possible.</p>
<p>Moreover, the vast amounts of money spent by Western governments to save the banks has left them with a staggering burden of debt. But the worst has been avoided, and in the developing countries there was scarcely even a recession.</p>
<p>The second predicted disaster that did not come to pass was a killer global pandemic like the 1918 strain of influenza. Something of that order is probably still lying in wait for us down the road, but the H1N1 flu turned out to be much less lethal than was initially feared. Considerable credit should go to those who made a vaccine available much faster than was thought possible, but basically we just got lucky.</p>
<p>And the third bad thing that didn't happen? The same bad thing that hasn't happened every year since 2001. There was no mass loss of life (by which I mean more than a thousand people murdered in a single incident) due to terrorist action in any Western country.</p>
<p>Even a relatively large death toll like that should not be a reason for any government to go berserk and start invading foreign countries. A thousand people is a lot to lose, but it really isn't the end of the world. A thousand people die of natural and accidental causes in the United States (to pick a country not entirely at random) about every three hours.</p>
<p>Terrorism is different, of course, but a rational and measured response is still required.</p>
<p>You know very well that it would be neither rational nor measured. Although an over-reaction is precisely what the terrorists are seeking to provoke, domestic political realities in the target country still make it likely that the response would be hugely stupid and violent.</p>
<p>So we go from year to year waiting for the terrorists to succeed again on the scale of 9/11, knowing that Western countries will go crazy again if they do. But it didn't happen in 2009.</p>
<p>What did finally happen at the beginning of 2009 was the long-overdue departure of the George W. Bush administration. Almost everybody outside the United States, and many people within it, were profoundly relieved by that, but it imposed a huge burden of expectation on the shoulders of his successor as president, Barack Obama.</p>
<p>It's been a difficult first year for Obama, who presumably expected to have both his health-care reforms and a climate change bill through the U.S. Congress by now. His problems with Afghanistan, however, are largely of his own making.</p>
<p>Then there was Copenhagen. The vast, 192-country conference on climate change in December was a total failure in terms of its declared objectives. There is no new treaty to replace the Kyoto accord. Even modest Kyoto-style national targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions were omitted from the vague declaration that was cobbled together by the two biggest emitters, the United States and China, on the last day. Neither are there any deadlines for further action.</p>
<p>"The Chinese hate numbers," as one participant put it – and the United States was quite happy to let China get the blame for killing a deal that Washington couldn't have delivered on either. The problem is that nobody really knows where we go from here, and time is running short. If there is one thing that 2009 is remembered for, it may be for the historic failure at Copenhagen.</p>

<p>Odds of catching H1N1 are 1 in 8</p>
<p>How contagious is swine flu? New research suggests less than the novel viruses that have caused big world outbreaks in the past.</p>
<p>If someone in your home has swine flu, your odds of catching it are about one in eight, although the study found children are twice as susceptible as adults.</p>
<p>It is one of the first big scientific attempts to find out how much the illness spreads in homes versus at work or school, and who is most at risk.</p>
<p>The study appears in today's New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>Researchers studied infection patterns in 216 people with swine flu in the U.S. (half of them children) and 600 people living with them. Respiratory illnesses that researchers assumed were swine flu developed in 78 of the 600 household members or 13 per cent. However, 10 per cent had symptoms more specific to flu. That's less than the "spread" rate during earlier flu pandemics in 1957 and 1968, when 14 per cent to 20 per cent of household members were infected.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba not helpful</p>
<p>The popular herbal supplement ginkgo biloba may not be everything it's claimed to be.</p>
<p>A study says it does not help slow mental decline in older adults.</p>
<p>The study examined whether a twice-daily 120-milligram dose of the supplement affected the rate of cognitive change over time in older adults.</p>
<p>U.S. researchers found no evidence it slows mental decline in healthy, aging individuals, or in people already showing the first signs of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>

<p>STEEL SHUTDOWN</p>
<p>Hamilton was rocked in March by the U.S. Steel announcement it was shutting down all operations at the former Stelco, throwing 1,500 employees in the city and Nanticoke out of work indefinitely.</p>
<p>The news was the most shocking ripple of the economic crisis that had been battering Hamilton and its struggling manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>"This is just going to devastate Hamilton," said Rolf Gerstenberger, president of the United Steelworkers union in Hamilton.</p>
<p>A portion of the laid-off workers returned a few months later.</p>
<p>THE TIGER-CATS</p>
<p>The return to respectability of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. After winning just 12 Canadian Football League contests in the previous three seasons, the Ticats, under the tutelage of head coach Marcel Bellefeuille, finished the 2009 campaign at 9-9. That was good enough to earn the Tabbies their first home playoff contest in eight seasons.</p>
<p>SUMMER OF FLOODS</p>
<p>The flood in mid-summer won't soon be forgotten, especially by homeowners in the city's east end. In some areas of the city more rain fell in two hours than is normally received in a month.</p>
<p>The flood prompted city council to offer up to $11 million to help cover the losses suffered by thousands. The city has also made flood prevention a priority with $30 million in sewer upgrades planned for this year and $200 million budgeted over the next five years.</p>
<p>PAN AM GAMES</p>
<p>The awarding of the 2015 Pan Am Games to Toronto proved a huge story for Hamilton. And for good reason. Hamilton will be the site of a 15,000-seat stadium of which the city will pay $45 million. Private funding for stadium expansion is expected to turn the facility into the new home for the Tiger-Cats.</p>
<p>The games will also deliver a new state-of-the-art pool for McMaster University.</p>
<p>Ontario will spend $1.4 billion for facilities and operations with $170 million flowing into Hamilton and Burlington.</p>
<p>The Pan Ams also helped soothe the sting from the city's two previous failed bids for the Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p>H1N1 OUTBREAK</p>
<p>The H1N1 outbreak made headlines in October and November across the province and the flu hit Hamilton harder than most communities. Hamilton schools were especially hit hard by the pandemic. And the situation wasn't helped by incidents of queue-jumping for vaccinations and by a shortage of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Hamilton opened up two flu assessment centres and Hamilton public health was on the front lines doing its best to keep a worried public calm.</p>
<p>CITY HALL</p>
<p>The ongoing Hamilton City Hall renovation project caught the public attention as municipal politicians squabbled over whether the new cladding should be marble or cheaper concrete. The latter won out. While the renovation went on quietly for the most part, the work was visible, with the former City Hall resembling a bombed-out building for most of the summer.</p>

<p>When Barack Obama was sworn in as U.S. President in January, many top Canadian scientists feared they would soon be hearing a great sucking sound as research resources and talent were drawn back to the United States.</p>
<p>After all, Canada had indirectly benefited from some of the restrictive science policies of the George W. Bush administration, such as federal funding curbs on stem-cell research. Canada, by contrast, seemed like a friendlier place to do science. Better still, many Canadian scientists had enjoyed hefty increases in their research grants in the early part of the decade.</p>
<p>Now the tables have turned. Mr. Obama declared that science is “essential” for America's continued health, security and prosperity. His economic-stimulus package included $10-billion (U.S.) for medical research.</p>
<p>At about the same time, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government trimmed the budgets of three granting agencies that fund university-based research – the type of work that can potentially generate major discoveries and groundbreaking innovations.</p>
<p>A lot of researchers are skeptical of the Canadian government's commitment to science, even though Ottawa has pledged more money for university infrastructure and equipment. The money, some researchers argue, should be going to “brains not bricks.”</p>
<p>The government's credibility took another hit when Gary Goodyear, the federal minister responsible for science and technology, declined to answer a question about whether he believes in evolution, during an interview with The Globe and Mail's science reporter Anne McIlroy. Mr. Goodyear, a chiropractor by training, later said he did believe in evolution but the remarks he made to clarify his position were so ambiguous that experts in developmental biology wondered whether he understood the concept.</p>
<p>Some high-profile scientists – including one of Canada's leading AIDS researchers, Rafick-Pierre Sékaly of the University of Montreal – have already begun to shift their research operations south of the border.</p>
<p>But it's far from an exodus, and Canada continues to attract U.S. investment. Californian and Canadian officials recently announced a $40-million joint venture in stem-cell research.</p>
<p>As this year draws to a close, it's not yet clear that the United States has regained its competitive edge.</p>
<p>“Obama is certainly pro-research and pro-science,” said Gordon Keller, a stem-cell biologist and director of Toronto's McEwen Centre for Regenerative Medicine.</p>
<p>“But he is facing trillion-plus-dollar deficits and trying to get health care off the ground. I am not sure how much money there will be for … increased long-term funding for National Institutes of Health,” which finances a substantial chunk of medical research in the United States.</p>
<p>Another factor in Canada's continued favour is government funding for the health-care system and universities, which provides many researchers with their core salaries, said John Dick, a senior scientist at the University Health Network in Toronto. “It's not a life and death situation if you lose your grant – you're are not out of a job the next month,” he explained. And that's not necessarily the case in the United States.</p>
<p>The following is a wrap-up of some of the year's medical highlights, low points and emerging trends to watch in 2010.</p>
<p>Lessons from a pandemic</p>
<p>The H1N1 influenza pandemic turned out to be not as bad as some were expecting.</p>
<p>It's impossible to calculate the severity of the outbreak, because the vast majority of cases never come to the attention of public health officials. But using the best available evidence from the United States, researchers at Harvard's School of Public Health and the U.K.'s Medical Research Council, have come up with two estimates.</p>
<p>Under one set of data and assumptions, they concluded 1.44 per cent of people with H1N1 symptoms were hospitalized and 0.048 per cent died. Under another set, 0.16 per cent were hospitalized and 0.007 per cent died, according to their study published earlier this month in the online journal PLoS Medicine.</p>
<p>That works out to a potential range of 7,800 to 29,000 deaths in the United States from H1N1, compared to the annual flu, which kills 36,000 in that country.</p>
<p>Using the same approach, that would mean between 780 and 2,900 H1N1 deaths in Canada. That's significantly fewer than the roughly 4,000 or more Canadians who die in a “normal” flu season. (The estimate from the Public Health Agency of Canada stood at 336 in mid-December – but this figure represents only confirmed deaths directly linked to H1N1.)</p>
<p>“Our work shows that the severity of H1N1 may be less than initially feared,” said Marc Lipsitch, who led the research team at Harvard.</p>
<p>Does that mean public health officials over-reacted to the perceived threat? No, says Dr. Lipsitch. “It's a sign of good judgment in public health to prepare for something worse than actually happens, because you can't know until it happens how bad it's going to be.”</p>
<p>He also noted that H1N1 hit some younger people especially hard, while the seasonal flu tends to take its biggest toll among the elderly.</p>
<p>“It's still bad. It's still putting people in hospital and it's killing more children than normal seasonal flu,” said Dr. Lipsitch. “So it's not harmless, but it's milder than other pandemics have been.”</p>
<p>While public health officials may have acted prudently, there were some snags and lessons to be learned for the next pandemic. H1N1 infections started to peak in Canada well before ample supplies of the vaccine could be produced and distributed across the country. Some experts say Canada may be better served by using multiple vaccine suppliers, rather than relying on just one company.</p>
<p>Folic acid folly?</p>
<p>For more than a decade, food manufacturers in Canada and the United States have been required by law to add folic acid to bread, pasta, flour and other grain products. The fortification effort is meant to ensure that women receive adequate levels of folic acid in case they become pregnant. The B vitamin is critical in the early stages of fetal development.</p>
<p>And, by all accounts, the mandatory program has been highly successful in reducing certain birth defects such as spina bifida, which has plunged by 50 per cent to about 110 cases a year in Canada.</p>
<p>However, other research has hinted that there might be a dark side to fortification – fuelling cancers in the general population.</p>
<p>Two studies, published earlier this year, suggested folic acid supplements may boost the odds of getting prostate and colon cancers.</p>
<p>Then, in November, yet another study showed an overall increase in cancer cases and deaths among Norwegians taking folic acid pills.</p>
<p>Although these findings are worrisome, experts generally agree there's not enough evidence to justify pulling the plug on folic acid fortification.</p>
<p>Still, it's certainly a research field worth watching. Policy makers may eventually be compelled to revisit a program that essentially treats everyone the same way – rather than targeting just those who are supposed to benefit from it.</p>
<p>New hope for MS?</p>
<p>An Italian doctor has captured international attention with a new theory – and possible treatment – for multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>Paolo Zamboni, a professor of medicine at the University of Ferrara, has published a series of papers suggesting that a narrowing of blood vessels in the neck could contribute to the development of MS. According to Dr. Zamboni, veins draining blood from the brain are malformed, or become blocked, leading to a buildup of iron in the brain which, he thinks, causes the neurological symptoms of MS.</p>
<p>By increasing blood flow, through a relatively simple operation, he believes symptoms can be reversed or minimized. The procedure has been performed on 65 MS patients, including Dr. Zamboni's wife, with mixed results.</p>
<p>The medical community looks upon Dr. Zamboni's work with some degree of skepticism. “We have seen similar claims of potential causes and cures in the past,” the University of British Columbia MS Clinic said in a recent statement.</p>
<p>Most previous research has indicated that MS is an autoimmune disease in which the body's own immune system attacks the protective myelin coating on nerves. The disease can affect balance, mobility, vision, hearing and memory. Dr. Zamboni acknowledges his findings are preliminary and need to be confirmed by other research teams. And even if the treatment works in some patients, MS may still be an autoimmune disorder. Poor blood drainage could simply be a trigger that sets the disease in motion, according to Dr. Zamboni.</p>
<p>The MS Society of Canada, with an annual research budget of about $10-million, has urged scientists to submit proposals to investigate the theory. UBC has requested funds to begin a study involving 100 patients.</p>
<p>Perplexing rise of celiac disease</p>
<p>Celiac disease was once considered to be a fairly rare disorder. But an increasing number of people are being stricken with the digestive ailment. And there is good reason to be concerned – it can lead to an early death.</p>
<p>A study by researchers at the <span class="companylink">Mayo Clinic</span> in Rochester, Minn., revealed the disease is 4.5 times more common today than it was about 50 years ago. “It now affects about one in 100 people,” said Joseph Murray, lead author of the study published in the journal Gastroenterology.</p>
<p>Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that damages the small intestine, interfering with the absorption of nutrients. It is triggered by gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye.</p>
<p>Dr. Murray says something must have changed in the environment to make the condition more common. He speculated that modern food production and processing could be to blame. But, he readily acknowledges, “it could be something entirely different.”</p>
<p>Faux journals Pharmaceutical companies will often use favourable studies and review articles published in peer-reviewed journals as part of their sale pitches to doctors.</p>
<p>“See, look how well our drug works,” the drug reps will say as they hand physicians reprints of the seemingly objective reports.</p>
<p>But what if there is a lack of published material? Or, more to the point, no articles with a positive spin?</p>
<p>Well, if you're especially audacious, it seems you just create a journal out of thin air.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical giant Merck paid an undisclosed sum to publishing firm Elsevier to produce several editions of what looked like peer-reviewed medical journals, The Scientist magazine revealed earlier this year.</p>
<p>The pseudo-publications, part of a Merck marketing effort to raise the profile of the company's drugs among Australian physicians, came to light during court proceedings.</p>
<p>One of the publications was titled The Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine and included glowing reviews of Merck's osteoporosis drug Fosamax and painkiller Vioxx, which has since been pulled from the market.</p>
<p>Rush to judgment</p>
<p>If there is a lesson to be learned from 2009 it's this: Don't jump to conclusions.</p>
<p>Take the case of a British schoolgirl who died within hours of receiving a vaccination that provides protection against cervical cancer.</p>
<p>Many parents – including some in Canada – began to question the safety of the shots.</p>
<p>However, an autopsy later revealed that Natalie Morton's chest cavity was filled with cancer.</p>
<p>It now appears the timing of her death, so close to getting the vaccine jab, was just a coincidence. The multiple tumours were so advanced, “death could have arisen at any point,” pathologist Alexander Kolar told an inquest.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>OK, here's what's happening... - Pundits make predictions for the year ahead</b>

</p>
<p>The last week of December often provokes people to think back over the year coming to an end.</p>
<p>Today, however, the Free Press looks ahead at the year about to begin. We asked three of Winnipeg's brightest commentators 10 questions about 2010.</p>
<p>THE PANEL:</p>
<p>CHRIS ADAMS, Probe Research vice-president, adjunct professor, University of Winnipeg / University of Manitoba</p>
<p>DAVID</p>
<p>BARNARD, University of Manitoba president and vice-chancellor</p>
<p>SHANNON</p>
<p>SAMPERT,</p>
<p>University of Winnipeg, political studies professor and pundit</p>
<p>THE ECONOMY</p>
<p>1. WILL THE SLOWDOWN LEAVE MANITOBA IN THE RED AND PUSH FEDERAL FINANCES DEEPER INTO DEFICIT?</p>
<p>ADAMS: Probe Research's recent Winnipeg Free Press/Jory Capital poll shows that 80 per cent of Manitobans are confident about the local economy. Yet provincial Finance Minister Rosann Wowchuk announced just before Christmas that there will be a shortfall of $592 million for the 2009 budget year. Compared to the federal government's growing debt load, and what is happening in Ontario, this is peanuts.</p>
<p>BARNARD: Experts at the University's Asper School of Business agree with others that in 2010 federal and provincial governments will be managing deficits created by the economic downturn and needed investment in economic stimulus. But Manitoba's diversified economy, resilient citizens and major economic contributors like the University of Manitoba ($1.8 billion annual economic impact) will soon bring about recovery.</p>
<p>SAMPERT: The decision by the Harper government to implement stimulus programs as a way of dealing with the economy has resulted in a record-breaking deficit situation in Canada. This could have an effect on Manitoba's economy and in particular in Winnipeg, which houses a large number of federal-government employees should the government decide to trim its public service.</p>
<p>NATIONAL NEWS</p>
<p>2. WILL CANADIAN VOTERS HEAD TO THE POLLS AGAIN FOR A FEDERAL ELECTION AND IF SO, WHO WILL WIN?</p>
<p>ADAMS: The odds are that we will have an election, simply because the Conservatives need support from at least one other party to pass any bills in the House of Commons. The outcome of a 2010 election depends on where the Liberals are riding on the roller-coaster of public support. Probe's polling data show that there would be few changes here in Manitoba.</p>
<p>BARNARD: I cannot predict if an election will be called, but if it is, the party with the majority of seats in the House of Commons will win.</p>
<p>SAMPERT: While I don't think we're going to see a record number turnout at the polls, Harper is likely going to see himself leading a majority for the first time. Ignatieff just can't bring in the polling numbers in the face of an effective and well-financed perpetual campaign being staged by the hungry Conservatives.</p>
<p>WINNIPEG</p>
<p>3. WILL SAM KATZ STILL BE MAYOR AFTER THE CIVIC ELECTION IN OCTOBER?</p>
<p>ADAMS: Probably. To unseat a sitting mayor there needs to be a strong challenger, without other contenders to divide the opposition vote. A June Probe Research/Winnipeg Free Press poll revealed that 74 per cent of Winnipeggers thought that Mayor Katz is performing well. However, this is soft: Only 16 per cent said he is doing it "very well." A few might jump the Sammy ship.</p>
<p>BARNARD: I hope that the civic election will result in a broad engagement of citizens in choosing our leaders. I also expect that following the election University of Manitoba alumni will again be in many leadership roles in civic government.</p>
<p>SAMPERT: Katz is a pretty average mayor, and being average will likely work to his advantage. He hasn't incensed voters enough to oust him; there doesn't seem to be a concerted bid to run a campaign against him. His incumbency will work to his advantage.</p>
<p>HEALTH</p>
<p>4. WILL THERE BE A THIRD WAVE OF H1N1?</p>
<p>ADAMS: Not wanting to pretend to be an expert on this topic (pollsters don't know everything, you know), there appears to be a lot of speculation out there in media reports. Worrisome is that there is a lot of winter left to go and it might be returning for years to come. Most of the Probe Research staff got the shot. Have you?</p>
<p>BARNARD: If there is, I'm reassured by the fact that University of Manitoba researchers will take the lead in identifying, tracking and advising on how to deal with the problem, as has been the case thus far. But I hope not. I was incapacitated for over two weeks with what was likely H1N1 and I don't want others to share that experience.</p>
<p>SAMPERT: Most experts suggest that H1N1 will be an issue for up to two years and the next three months are the months in which we tend to become more prone to illness. What is particularly scary is that so few people have been inoculated in Manitoba -- only about a third of the population has received the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>THE WORLD</p>
<p>5. WILL THE TROOP SURGE IN AFGHANISTAN RESULT IN FEWER DEATHS FOR CANADIAN AND ALLIED SOLDIERS?</p>
<p>ADAMS: We can only hope that there will be fewer deaths for Canadians, our allies and others living in Afghanistan. Who could have predicted at the beginning of this decade that such questions would be asked? Certainly not me, nor most of our fellow panellists.</p>
<p>BARNARD: Eventually, and we can all pray that it will be soon.</p>
<p>SAMPERT: There are still considerable issues with corruption in governance in Afghanistan and many see a troop surge built on an alliance with a corrupt government as doomed. Recent polls suggest that Canadians aren't sold on the U.S. troop surge, either. Bottom line: We'll see more young men and women coming home in body bags in what is becoming another Vietnam.</p>
<p>6. THE U.S. SAYS IT WILL BE DOWN TO 50,000 SOLDIERS IN IRAQ BY AUGUST 2010 -- THERE ARE ABOUT 115,000 NOW. WILL IT MAKE THE CUT?</p>
<p>ADAMS: According to my better-informed friends who do research and teach about such matters, it looks like there is a real probability that this will happen. Despite recent "high-profile attacks," violence has declined to pre-2003 levels. Obama wants out, as do an increasing number of Americans. Trimming to 50,000 is likely.</p>
<p>BARNARD: President Obama's commitment to peace was certainly enough to impress the Nobel committee. That commitment will motivate him to at least come very close to making this cut.</p>
<p>SAMPERT: This looks promising. There seems to be a transition from a focus on Iraq to a focus on Afghanistan and Pakistan and there seems to be an interest in decreasing its numbers in Iraq to focus on these fronts. That could all change should there be a resurgence of a Sunni backlash. Much still could go wrong. But for now, it looks good.</p>
<p>7. WILL THE U.S. LIFT ITS EMBARGO ON CUBA?</p>
<p>ADAMS: Florida is a key electoral state, and with many Cuban-Americans located in Florida you can bet the Democrats are examining how such a decision would influence their party's fortunes in the mid-term congressional elections and the next presidential election. Because they are juggling too many hot-potato issues now, I predict that the embargo will stay in 2010.</p>
<p>BARNARD: Eventually, but it is unlikely to be a priority in the coming year. In the meantime, the University of Manitoba's faculty of nursing will continue training Cuban nurses and working to improve that country's health-care system.</p>
<p>SAMPERT: This seems to be the last vestige of the Cold War and now in a time of hyper-globalization, it may be a good time to resume trade with Cuba. Maybe Obama could stem his falling polling numbers by offering Americans Cuba as a cheap tropical vacation location.</p>
<p>SPORTS</p>
<p>8. WILL THERE BE A SEVENTH CANADIAN NHL TEAM TO START THE 2010-11 SEASON? IF SO, WILL IT BE IN WINNIPEG?</p>
<p>ADAMS: It's funny how our NHL fortunes keep pace with those of Quebec City, whose beloved Nordiques entered the NHL along with the Jets and Oilers, left to the U.S. at the same time, and now the Nordiques look to be coming home again soon. A June 2009 Probe Research/Jory Capital poll revealed that a majority of Winnipeggers want the same for our city.</p>
<p>BARNARD: That would be a great addition to the city.</p>
<p>SAMPERT: The loss of the Jets has caused such psychic injury to Winnipeg, it's still an emotional topic more than a decade later. No. We're not going to get an NHL team. We can't afford it. And the league would be foolish to expand at a time when the average consumer is having a hard time putting food on the table.</p>
<p>9. WILL CANADA 'OWN THE PODIUM' (WIN THE MOST MEDALS) AT THE VANCOUVER OLYMPICS?</p>
<p>ADAMS: According to a recent Winnipeg Free Press article (Dec. 19), Canada ranks seventh in the all-time record for medals, behind such countries as Norway, Germany and the U.S.A. What is so different for 2010? While cheering for all of our athletes, especially (speedskater) Cindy (Klassen), we want gold medals for curling and hockey.</p>
<p>BARNARD: We're all hoping for great things from our athletes, including Manitobans Cindy Klassen and Clara Hughes (honorary graduates from the University of Manitoba).</p>
<p>SAMPERT: We'll do better than in years in which we're not the host country, but we won't win the most medals. We don't spend the money we need to train these athletes like they do in other countries. Regardless, we'll still be incredibly proud of those who sport the Canadian flag when they wave from the podium.</p>
<p>10. WHICH IS MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN 2010: THE BOMBERS MAKE THE PLAYOFFS OR SOD IS TURNED ON THE LONG-PROMISED NEW FOOTBALL STADIUM?</p>
<p>ADAMS: When polling 1,000 Manitobans 18 months ago about the stadium, approximately half told us they supported the use of public funds for this purpose. Although there are more hurdles for David Asper and others to overcome before any sod-turning occurs, it's hard to imagine that we are on an equally positive track towards making the playoffs. We need a general manager, coach, not to mention some player personnel changes.</p>
<p>BARNARD: I'm fully expecting that the sod will turn on the new stadium. And I look forward to watching playoff games for both the Bombers and the Bisons there when it is completed.</p>
<p>SAMPERT: Or Mike Kelly returns as the coach? Honestly, none of those seems to be a reality in 2010.</p>

<div>RALLY / DAKAR 2010</div>
<div>Globe Megawheels</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Canadian hopes third time will be the charm; Montrealer Patrick Trahan's pursuit to complete the world's most dangerous motor race has come at a steep price</b>
</div><div>PHILIPPE DEVOS   </div>
<div>1442 words</div><div>31 December 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>G8</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

   </div>
</p>
<p>More than 380 motorcycles, quads, cars and trucks will be at the starting line tomorrow for the start of the annual Dakar Rally, and no one can remember a year when there were more Canadians among them.</p>
<p>Seven competitors from the Great White North have registered for the gruelling, 17-day off-road race in the South American wilderness.</p>
<p>Some have tried it before, but none has attempted it more times than Montrealer Patrick Trahan, who's lining up for his third start, 10 years after he first tried to conquer the most dangerous motor race in the world.</p>
<p>The man</p>
<p>He left a career as an IT consultant to devote himself full-time to motorcycling some 12 years ago. “When I'm passionate about something, I don't wait; I do.” In 1998, he showed up for his first motorcycle rally in Morocco with 10 hours total riding experience and a new Kawasaki KLR650. That's like showing up for a NASCAR Sprint Cup race with a learner's permit and a Chevy Impala straight off the lot. But he didn't let naivety get the better of his passion. Despite repeated crashes, he managed to finish by MacGyvering his tools into spare parts (a vise grip replaced a cracked gear shifter), and at one point getting towed out of the sand by a camel. “There's two kinds of people,” the 42-year-old says. “The people who hate the Dakar: They do one, and it's so painful you'll never see them again. The other kind of people, they like the Dakar. It's a virus and they'll do everything in their life to go back again.”</p>
<p>The mission</p>
<p>The Dakar Rally has been run yearly since 1979. Originally an African rally, this is only the second year it's been held in South America, after terrorist threats caused the 2008 event to be cancelled. This year's route follows a 9,000-kilometre loop from Buenos Aires through Chile and back again over dirt tracks, towering dunes and gravel roads, with speeds reaching 150 km an hour. Each day consists of a timed section as long as 600 km, bracketed by connections as long as 400 km to get from the previous night's camp to the day's race course, and then to the night's rest stop. If you miss the start of the timed section or take too long to finish, you face disqualification. If you're delayed reaching the day's destination, there will be little time for rest and repairs. Only a handful of elite racers are vying for a podium spot; most are just trying to be among the 40 per cent or so who finish. You can follow Trahan's progress at dakartrahan.blogspot.com and dakar.com</p>
<p>The machine Trahan's 2009 Honda CRX450X has been modified with a carbon fibre and Kevlar fairing, engine guard and auxiliary gas tanks, reinforced Excel racing wheels, steel valves more durable than the original titanium, emergency water supply, a tool kit and electronics that include GPS tracking, telecommunications, emergency response and a warning system when faster vehicles are passing. A road-book holder carries a scroll of hieroglyphics that indicate the route. His team's support vehicle carries a bike's worth of spare parts and several fresh tires.</p>
<p>The inspiration</p>
<p>The pilot light was ignited at age 15, when Trahan was in Switzerland for a ski competition and a man clad in motocross gear arrived at the airport in the middle of winter. The rider had just dropped out of the Dakar , and his stories sparked something in the teenaged boy. In the years that followed, the Dakar flame grew into an unquenchable inferno.</p>
<p>The preparation</p>
<p>After his first unlikely rally finish in Morocco, he sought instruction and off-road riding opportunities. He entered the Dakar for the first time in 2000 and again in 2001, failing to finish both times due to crashes and breakdowns. Since then, he made two more unsuccessful attempts to enter the rally, and finished smaller rallies in Egypt, Dubai and Mexico. He's spent several years guiding off-road motorcycle tours in Morocco, Tunisia and Italy, and this past summer ran riding events for <span class="companylink">Honda Canada</span> while arranging logistics and organizing more than $80,000 in funding and sponsorship to mount his latest Dakar challenge.</p>
<p>The sacrifices</p>
<p>The quixotic pursuit of a Dakar finish has led to personal bankruptcy and divorce from his wife of 14 years. “It was the Dakar or me,” she told him when he wanted to try the rally a second time. Now, the Dakar is his long-term relationship.</p>
<p>The risks</p>
<p>Forty-nine competitors have died in the rally's 30-year history, most of them on motorcycles. It's a statistic that weighs on Trahan's mother, whose husband and only other son died in a vehicle accident when Patrick was age seven. “When the Dakar is on TV,” he said, “she doesn't look.” Trahan is more worried about not finishing.</p>
<p>The rewards First prize isn't enough to cover the entry fee. Like climbing Everest or running with the bulls in Pamplona, the rewards come from overcoming fears and obstacles to achieve what few have even tried.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>The other Canadians</p>
<p>Since the Dakar rally started in 1979, no one can recall a year with more Canadians entrants. These are the other Canucks who will be on the starting line in Buenos Aires tomorrow.</p>
<p>Rick Hatswell After keeping his riding habit a secret from his motorcycle-hating father for 10 years, Hatswell finally had a reason to come clean. The 34-year-old from Vancouver wanted the family's car repair chain to sponsor his Dakar dream. “This was the biggest challenge,” he says of the many obstacles he had to overcome to make it to the starting line. Follow him at roadtotherally.com and dakar.com</p>
<p>Dirk Kessler The seed was planted early for Kessler and after more than 20 years following the Dakar as a fan, he's entered for 2010 as a competitor. “If I keep on waiting, how old am I going to be before I'm too old to do it?” says the 44-year-old software developer from Vancouver, who now lives in San Francisco. “If I get the red shirt for the last guy who comes in, at least I made it.” Follow him at dakar.com</p>
<p>Donald Hatton Forget about finishing the Dakar, Hatton has had a hard enough time getting started. The 51-year-old motorcycle shop owner from Duncan, B.C., was ready for his first Dakar in 2008, when it was cancelled due to terrorist threats. He regrouped for the 2009 event, but crashed at 140 km/h on the fourth day, leaving him with a lacerated lung and multiple broken bones. After eight months of convalescence, his first training ride left him with a broken hand that needed surgery. When he recovered from that, he caught H1N1. But he isn't deterred. “Rallying has just gotten into my blood,” he says. Follow him at destinationdakar.ca and dakar.com</p>
<p>Andrew Scott Scott, a 43-year technical specialist for Barrick Gold, has been working out four to five hours a day to be strong enough for the gruelling event. “I've never done something quite this big,” says the Australian native, who's lived in Canada for six years, the last four in Toronto. “The butterflies aren't going away.” Follow him at ajsdakar.com and dakar.com</p>
<p>Christian Girouard</p>
<p>and Lawrence Hacking</p>
<p>Girouard had his mind set on entering the 2012 Dakar on a motorcycle, and sought advice from Hacking, the only Canadian to have finished the race. The two struck up a friendship, and Hacking soon asked the 38-year-old media relations manager from Ottawa to be his co-driver for 2010. Hacking finished the Dakar on his first attempt in 2001 on a motorcycle, and recently released a book about the feat: To Dakar and Back. Now the 55-year-old from Georgetown, Ont., is trying to repeat the feat in the car class. “You learn a lot about yourself when you attempt the Dakar,” says Hacking, who has a long involvement in off-road motorcycle racing and event organizing in Canada and currently runs World Enduro Canada.

<p>As the city at the centre of the universe never tires</p>
<p>of boasting about itself: We're world-class jackasses</p>
<p>A 39-day outside workers strike; five professional sports teams that failed to make the play-on cut; a lame-schmuck mayor; a slew of cops charged, then de-charged, then re-charged; loopy judges who should be bench-pressed out of court and a cavalcade of hapless, hopeless crooks, though some even had MBAs.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Where do we go from here? 2010's hot spots</b>
</div><div>967 words</div><div>31 December 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>T02</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>This time of year you can hardly swing a hamster without running into somebody's list of what's hot for the coming travel season. As my boss keeps telling me, people love lists.</p>
<p>There are good reasons almost every year for identifying certain countries or cities as hot spots. This coming year is more notable than many, however, what with Vancouver/Whistler hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, Shanghai's Expo 2010 and the World Cup of soccer heading to South Africa for the first time. Toss in the once-a-decade return of the Passion Play in Oberammergau, Germany, and a couple of Latin American anniversaries, and you've got a pretty good gumbo boiling in the global pot.</p>
<p>Jerome Guidollet of www.travelalerts.ca[http://www.travelalerts.ca] says searches for all-inclusive, seven-day packages are at an all-time high, as people seek out deals for Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Mexico.</p>
<p>"Cuba is by far the big winner," said Guidollet. "Prices are really cheap and Cuba has a great variety of destinations, from Varadero to Holguin, Cayo Coco, Cayo Largo, Havana, Santa Clara and more."</p>
<p>In the D.R., he says Punta Cana has picked up steam and has become "the place to go" in the Dominican.</p>
<p>Guidolett says searches for Mexico are heavy and don't appear to have been influenced by the 2009 H1N1 scare.</p>
<p>The numbers are still small compared to the big three of Mexico, Cuba and the D.R., but he says Central American destinations such as Costa Rica and Panama are gaining ground. There were political problems this year, but Nicagarua appears to have settled down. And one major publication, Lonely Planet, recently singled out El Salvador as a place to check out.</p>
<p>Florida remains the favourite American getaway spot for many Torontonians. Things will pick up this spring when the new Harry Potter ride opens at Universal Studios in Orlando, while Busch Gardens will open the Sesame Street Safari of Fun. And Frommer's named the Florida panhandle beaches as one of its top 2010 destinations.</p>
<p>Guidollet says Las Vegas and Hawaii are the top spots for Western Canadian searches at travelalerts.</p>
<p>The Star's Richard Ouzounian was recently in Vegas to check out the new City Center development and the early reviews are outstanding as a destination that doesn't feel like traditional Vegas but still offers up great hotels, shops and restaurants.</p>
<p>Hawaii had a tough time in 2009, notwithstanding the election of Hawaii native Barack Obama to the U.S. presidency. But a recent survey by the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau said the airline industry plans to add almost 500,000 more passenger seats on flights to the islands for 2010. A huge percentage of that, nearly 310,000 seats, are expected to come from Canada. It remains to be seen if U.S. destinations will be hurt by the new security rules brought in after the attempted bombing of an airplane over Detroit on Christmas Day. But it doesn't look as if air fares will be quite as attractive in 2010, what with rising fuel prices and general consolidation moves by the airlines.</p>
<p>"It doesn't mean you won't still see cheap fares but you'll have to shop more carefully to find the cheapest fares," Air Canada chief Calin Rovinescu said just before Christmas.</p>
<p>Cruising also should be big, with tons of new ships with wild features and plenty of good deals. Stuart MacDonald of www.tripharbour.ca[http://www.tripharbour.ca] says Caribbean and European sailings for 2010 are selling for less than $100 a day, and some for as little as $50 a day.</p>
<p>"And since the price of a cruise includes accomodation, meals, entertainment and transportation from the point of embarkation, it's far less expensive than a comparable vacation on land."</p>
<p>Keeping all that in mind, here's my Top 10 destinations for 2010 (in alphabetical order). We've got another 10 spots to watch on our website, www.thestar.com/travel[http://www.thestar.com/travel].</p>
<p>1. Antarctica: Not to be a climate change downer, but there appears to be an increase in interest from cruisers who want to see it while it lasts.</p>
<p>2. Colombia: The country is making a concerted public relations push. It has a wealth of geographic blessings, from towering green mountains to Caribbean and Pacific beaches.</p>
<p>3. Cuba: With the U.S. talking about finally opening up the border, this is an ideal time to take advantage of the generosity towards visiting Canadians.</p>
<p>4. Las Vegas: Tons of new hotels could spark another price war. Some rooms in December were going for as little as $14.</p>
<p>5. Germany: It's the 20th anniversary of reunification. It's also a year in which the Passion Play will be staged again.</p>
<p>6. Mexico: It's the 200th anniversary of independence. And the deals are strong as they try to deal with crime scares and the flu situation.</p>
<p>7. New Zealand: Filming could start soon on The Hobbit, which likely will spark tourism interest. Also, the kiwi dollar is down around 75 cents versus the loonie.</p>
<p>8. Shanghai: If the 2010 Expo, which opens May 15, is half as impressive as the Beijing Olympics, and you know they want to outdo their northern brethren, this will be special. A recent survey said China will edge out Spain for the third most popular global travel destination by 2020; putting it behind the U.S. and France.</p>
<p>9. South Africa: Stepping into the spotlight with the World Cup, starting in June.</p>
<p>10. Vancouver/Whistler: As much as B.C. will be front and centre in February, it'll be interesting to see if there's a boom later on.</p>

</p>
<p>We've reached the end of 2009, which forever will be remembered as the year Tiger Woods' erratic driving -- off the course more than on -- caught up to him in a big way.</p>
<p>Seth Meyers, the host of Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update segment, may have put it best when he said: "Last week, Tiger Woods hit a tree and a bunch of women fell out."</p>
<p>After Woods had a minor traffic incident, women came out of the Woods-work to claim they'd had a fling with Tiger. It eventually reached the mid-teens -- that's the number of women, not their ages -- and Woods now faces the prospect of losing much of his fortune in a divorce settlement.</p>
<p>From Woods' "transgressions" to baseball stars being accused of using performance-enhancing drugs to disgraced NFLer Adam (Pacman) Jones pondering a stint in the CFL, there was something for everyone.</p>
<p>Here are some of The Spectator's favourite lines and quotes from 2009.</p>
<p>Lost in the Woods</p>
<p>- "Apparently when he told his wife, Elin Nordegren, he was going out to play a round, he was really going out to play around." -- The Spectator.</p>
<p>- "He must have really sweetened the deal. Elin is now third on the career money list." -- Dan Daly of the Washington Times, after Woods reportedly redid his prenuptial agreement with Nordegren in the hopes of convincing her to stay with him.</p>
<p>- "Even NBA players are saying, 'Dude, give it a rest.' " -- Comedy writer Alex Kaseberg, after he heard the list of women with whom Woods allegedly had flings had reached double digits.</p>
<p>- "That makes him a cereal eater and a serial dater." -- Gary Loewen of the Toronto Sun, after the London Sun reported Woods was sitting around watching cartoons and munching on cereal.</p>
<p>- "Woods was picked for his domination, performance and stamina. He didn't do too badly on the golf course, either." -- Comedy writer Jim Barach after the Associated Press named Woods its athlete-of-the-decade.</p>
<p>- "That seems fitting: Sweden is part of Scandalnavia, y'know." -- The Spectator, after reports suggested Woods and Nordegren were thinking of moving to her home country.</p>
<p>A Shot in the Dark</p>
<p>- "Suspicions were raised when he became the first player to hit for the menstrual cycle." -- Saskatoon StarPhoenix reader Jeff Funnekotter, after Los Angeles Dodgers slugger Manny Ramirez was hit with a 50-game suspension for taking female fertility drugs.</p>
<p>- "Had Manny Ramirez been traded to Minnesota during his suspension, then gone on a tear upon returning, the headline would have been: Manny Carrying Twins." -- Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle.</p>
<p>- "The crusade sounds like an exercise in fertility, uh, futility." -- The Spectator, after an online campaign was launched to put Ramirez onto the National League all-star team even though he was suspended.</p>
<p>- "Publishers are said to be trying to decide whether they would classify the book as fiction or non-fiction." -- David Thomas of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, after hearing that pitcher Roger Clemens was thinking about writing a book to refute claims that he used performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
<p>- "Apparently they did, because the next day Kate tested positive for steroids." -- Kaseberg, after the New York Post's gossip page suggested Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez was spotted kissing actress Kate Hudson.</p>
<p>- "That explains the A he got in chemistry." -- The Spectator, after a book alleged A-Rod may have started using steroids in high school.</p>
<p>Diamond Mines</p>
<p>- "Welcome to today's economy, George Steinbrenner. Put in $201 million, get out $7,750." -- The Spectator, after a website estimated the melt value of the Yankees' World Series trophy.</p>
<p>- "Wendell is 41. And a joker. And, some might say (given the franchise's track record), also an optimist." -- Elliott Harris of the Chicago Sun-Times, after ex-Cubs reliever Turk Wendell -- asked by sportingnews.com to fill in the blank "When the Cubs win the World Series, I'll ..." -- replied "Be 99 years old."</p>
<p>- "On the bright side, though, the Nats just found a spray hitter for the meat of the lineup." -- Dwight Perry of the Seattle Times, after foil-wrapped hot dogs launched into the stands by Washington Nationals mascot Screech came apart in flight, raining chunks of wieners and buns onto fans.</p>
<p>- "Apparently, no one has had the heart to tell McCain that he's been Twittering with his garage door opener." -- Tonight Show host Conan O'Brien, after hearing that 72-year-old Republican presidential candidate John McCain was using Twitter in an attempt to get Arizona Diamondbacks slugger Mark Reynolds into baseball's all-star game.</p>
<p>- "On the other hand, there is no explanation why Sosa keeps saying Billie Jean is not his lover." -- Reggie Hayes of the Fort Wayne News-Sentinel, after a friend of Sammy Sosa said the former major-leaguer was undergoing a skin-cleansing process -- which explained why his face looked lighter in photos.</p>
<p>- "The culprits apparently did it without batting an eye." -- The Spectator, on reports that the employees of the cryonics company that froze the body of Boston Red Sox legend Ted Williams took swings at his disembodied head.</p>
<p>Blue Lines</p>

<p>EX-ARCHBISHOP JAILED FOR ABUSE</p>
<p>BUENOS AIRES -- The Catholic former archbishop of Argentina's Santa Fe province has been sentenced to eight years in prison for "aggravated sexual abuse" against a seminarian, a court source said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Judge Maria Mascheroni said Edgardo Storni, now 73, took advantage of his access to and authority over the young man when the crime was committed in 1992, while he was archbishop.</p>
<p>Under Argentine law, Storni will serve out his sentence under house arrest because he is more than 70 years old.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICA</p>
<p>MODERATE QUAKE JOLTS BORDER CITY</p>
<p>TIJUANA, Mexico -- A moderate earthquake of 5.9 magnitude rattled the Mexican city of Mexicali just south of the California border on Wednesday, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.</p>
<p>Mexican civil defence officials said they were investigating the quake but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.</p>
<p>Mexicali, east of the city of Tijuana, is home to a number of factories that assemble goods for export to the U.s.</p>
<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>TWO DIE IN POLISH TATRA AVALANCHE</p>
<p>WARSAW -- Two people were killed and three injured Wednesday in an avalanche in Poland's Tatra mountains, the country's rescue service said.</p>
<p>The service's chief, Jan Krzysztof, told the Polish news channel TVN24 that the three injured individuals were in hospital, one of them in critical condition.</p>
<p>The avalanche occurred in the 2,499-metre Rysy range, which draws large numbers of winter tourists. A similar accident there killed eight people in January 2003.</p>
<p>POLAND SEEKS HELP IN SIGN THEFT PROBE</p>
<p>WARSAW -- Poland said Wednesday it was poised to ask Sweden for judicial assistance in its probe of the theft of the infamous Nazi German "Arbeit Macht Frei" sign from the former Auschwitz death camp.</p>
<p>Polish Justice Minister Krzysztof Kwiatkowski spoke with his Swedish counterpart Beatrice Ask, the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Their discussion focused on a request for judicial assistance being drawn up by regional prosecutors in Krakow," the southern Polish city where the probe is being steered, it said.</p>
<p>The relatively rare step of involving ministers came "because of the importance of the case," it added.</p>
<p>Last week, Polish investigators said the mastermind of the Dec. 18 theft lived abroad.</p>
<p>But they have consistently refused to confirm media reports that the individual is in Sweden, that his or her name is known to Polish justice authorities, and that they plan to ask the Swedes for an arrest.</p>
<p>ALCOHOL INVOLVED IN BRIT'S DEATH</p>
<p>GENEVA -- The 23-year-old English tourist who fell to his death from a 100-metre high cliff, was under "strong influence of alcohol" at the time of the incident, Swiss local police said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Based on findings to date, investigators believe that the incident was likely to have been an accident.</p>
<p>"The young English tourist ... was under strong influence of alcohol at his time of death.</p>
<p>"He fell off a 100-metre high cliff, while he was on a steep and difficult terrain... He died due to his serious injuries," said police from the canton of Bern in a statement.</p>
<p>Autopsy results have shown no indication that a third party was involved in the incident, they added.</p>
<p>Police did not specify the name of the tourist, but local media had earlier identified him as Myles Robinson.</p>
<p>INDIAN ARRESTED FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING</p>
<p>ROME -- Italian police have arrested an Indian man sought by Belgian authorities for alleged human trafficking and helping illegal migrants, an Italian newspaper reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pal Devinder, 32, who was being hunted on a European arrest warrant issued by Belgium, was picked up in northern Italy as he tried to leave a building with his bags packed, according to the Piacenza Sera paper's website.</p>
<p>AUSTRIA RELEASES WEAPONS SMUGGLER</p>
<p>VIENNA -- An Austrian court released on Wednesday a fugitive sought by the United States for supplying mustard gas ingredients to Iran in the 1980s, two days after his arrest in an Alpine ski resort ended 20 years on the run.</p>
<p>Peter Walaschek, a German citizen, had pleaded guilty in a U.S. court in 1988 of shipping to Iran 115 tonnes of thiodiglycol, a chemical used to make mustard gas, police said. Mustard gas was used during Iran's war with Iraq in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Walaschek fled the United States while awaiting sentencing. He was held for several months in Croatia in the mid-1990s but Croatian courts did not find his extradition justified under Croatian laws at the time, Austrian police said.</p>
<p>12,200 SWINE FLU DEATHS IN 2009</p>
<p>GENEVA -- Swine flu, which first emerged in Mexico in March 2009, has killed at least 12,220 people worldwide, the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It said the Americas, especially the United States and Canada, has been the worst affected with at least 6,670 victims this year.</p>
<p>The WHO said that eastern and central Europe were the most active areas for transmission.</p>
<p>It said there had been at least 2,422 confirmed fatal cases in Europe.</p>
<p>AFRICA</p>
<p>NIGERIAN AIRPORTS TO GET 3D SCANNERS</p>
<p>LAGOS -- Nigeria is to install 3D body scanners at its international airports to step up security after a failed attack on a U.S. airliner by a Nigerian, civil aviation chief said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Nigeria will be upgrading its security screening system to 3D total body imaging scanner," Harold Demuren, director general of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority told reporters.</p>
<p>Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, is accused of trying to blow up a <span class="companylink">Northwest Airlines</span> Airbus as it was landing at Detroit on Dec. 25 from <span class="companylink">Amsterdam's Schiphol airport</span>.</p>
<p>SIX DIE IN CONGO MINE COLLAPSE</p>
<p>LUBUMBASHI -- Six miners were killed and five others injured when a commercially abandoned mine collapsed in southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the mayor of the local town said.</p>
<p>The collapse occurred in a former copper mine of state company <span class="companylink">Gecamines</span>, burying the clandestine miners.</p>
<p>"Six diggers have been killed and we count five injured, including one seriously," Charlotte Mabansime, the mayor of the mining town of Kolwezi, 300 kilometres northwest of provincial capital Lubumbashi.</p>
<p>31 PRISONERS IN SA JAILBREAK</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG -- Thirty-one prisoners broke out of a South African police station overnight by sawing away the roof of their cell, a police spokesman said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It is alleged that 31 suspects, most of them illegal miners, sawed their way out by cutting the secured metal roof of the ... cell" in the eastern town of Barberton, Captain Leonard Hlathi told AFP.</p>
<p>Five of the men were caught by police, who also arrested an accomplice, said Hlathi, who added that a manhunt had been launched for the other escapees.</p>
<p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
<p>SOMALI PIRATES FIRE AT OIL TANKER</p>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR -- Heavily armed Somali pirates fired on a Kuwaiti oil tanker near the Arabian Sea on Wednesday in an attempt to hijack the vessel, a global maritime watchdog said.</p>
<p>Noel Choong, head of the International Maritime Bureau piracy reporting centre in Kuala Lumpur, told AFP pirates armed with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades launched the attack from a skiff off Somali waters.</p>
<p>"The Somali pirates chased the tanker and sprayed bullets early Wednesday in a bid to hijack the ship," he said.</p>
<p>"Fortunately, the tanker managed to escape the pirates," Choong said, adding there were no reports of injuries to the crew.</p>
<p>SUICIDE BOMBSKILL DOZENS</p>
<p>RAMADI, Iraq -- Twin suicide bombs killed at least 27 and wounded more than 100 in Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland on Wednesday and a roadside bomb killed seven pilgrims returning from a major Shi'ite Muslim religious festival.</p>
<p>The attacks underscored the tenacity of the insurgency despite a steep drop in overall violence and reflected Iraq's vulnerability as it prepares for national polls in March and for local troops to take over from U.S. forces.</p>
<p>U.S. forces flew Qassim Mohammed, governor of Anbar province west of the Iraqi capital, to Baghdad for treatment after he was wounded in the attacks outside the provincial government headquarters in Ramadi, Anbar's provincial capital.</p>
<p>Hospital and police sources said Sadoon Khraibit, a member of Anbar's governing council, and its deputy police chief were wounded in the attacks, which left charred cars, their chassis buckled from the explosion, and bloody wreckage on the street.</p>
<p>TALIBAN CLAIM PARADE ATTACK</p>
<p>PESHAWAR -- Pakistan's feared Taliban network claimed responsibility Wednesday for a suicide bombing that killed 43 people at a Shiite parade in Karachi and threatened further attacks.</p>
<p>The claim was made by one of Pakistan's most wanted commanders in the Tehreek-e-Taliban movement, which for two months has been targeted by a military offensive near the Afghan border.</p>
<p>Monday's attack in Pakistan's biggest city reduced to carnage events marking the Shiites' holiest day, Ashura, and sparked riots, underlining the security challenge faced by the nuclear-armed Muslim country.</p>

<p>Neill had a history of asthma and pneumonia but did not get the H1N1 vaccine, his parents say.</p>

<p>SPECIAL BONUS QUESTION</p>
<p>Is the world a better place than a century ago? The 20th century was the bloodiest and most destructive on record. And that first decade was also marked by its share of terrorism, wars, natural calamities and financial collapse as well as more sanguine events. It would seem, as the American playwright Tennessee Williams said, "Humanity is a work in progress" -- and progress is slow. Put the following events in chronological order by year starting with 1900.</p>
<p>1. Death of Queen Victoria</p>
<p>2. Russo-Japanese War</p>
<p>3. Model "T" Ford introduced</p>
<p>4. Sigmund Freud publishes The Interpretation of Dreams</p>
<p>5. Baden-Powell forms the Boy Scouts</p>
<p>6. Austria annexes Bosnia and Herzogovina</p>
<p>7. Entente Cordiale between Britain and France</p>
<p>8. John Galsworthy publishes The Man of Property</p>
<p>9. Treaty of Vereniging ends Boer War</p>
<p>10. Mutiny on Potemkin and aborted revolution in Russia</p>

<p>4. "Chad" were bits, in various stages of attachment, left by a voting machine punching ballot paper. During the Florida recount in the American election they were assessed as "hanging," "swinging" or "dimpled," interpretations that were instrumental in awarding George W.

<div id="hd"><b>Risks of H1N1 vaccine have been exaggerated</b>
</div><div>Connor Henderson   </div>
<div>550 words</div><div>30 December 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>I have heard many people saying that they don't want to get the H1N1 vaccine because of the risks involved with it.</p>
<p>These risks include allergic reactions with some of the ingredients in the vaccine or physical soreness from the shot.</p>
<p>Many of these fears stem from the stories we, now regularly, hear in the media about people who have had reactions and are now sick. There's even a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> group supporting the idea.</p>
<p>What we don't as regularly hear about is that the majority of the people who get the shot don't have anything happen to them. Remember all those long lines people were complaining about when the vaccine was first released? Compared to those stories, you probably have only heard of a very small number of people who have experienced negative reactions to the shots.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I went to get the vaccination with my family. The biggest reaction any of us had was soreness the next day. The doctor's office we went to didn't see any reactions to the shot since the office started offering it. Honestly, it barely hurt more than a regular flu shot. The comfort from knowing that I most likely wasn't going to get the virus more than offset that little amount of pain.</p>
<p>In my opinion, everyone should get the shot, even if you aren't in the problem zone. All the ideas and paranoia that you will get about receiving the shot should be expelled. The only thing that they succeed in doing is causing fewer people to get the shot, further advancing the intensity of the virus.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a small chance that you could have a reaction, but the chances that you won't are much higher, and the chances that you will get the virus if you don't get the shot are also higher.</p>
<p>The virus by the way is a killer, let's not forget. So your options are getting the shot and having the small chance of getting ill but not dying, or not getting the shot and possibly getting the virus and dying.</p>
<p>So basically, the pros outweigh the cons. If everyone were to get this shot it could keep a lot of people from dying by halting the disease's progression and evolution. And wasn't that the main goal the government first had when releasing this vaccination to the public?</p>
<p>That is why you should stop thinking now, weighing the decision and just go out and get the shot before the new yearwhen you'll probably have less chance of going out and getting it and probably feel more reluctant to go anyway.</p>
<p>There is also speculation among the medical community that we could see another surge of H1N1 cases in January. Just remember as you go out and get the shot , you may be saving your own life and others.</p>
<p>Also that any soreness is worth the small risk of actually getting a reaction.</p>
<p>Or you could not go and get it done and take the risk of getting the virus and possibly dying. I know what I would do but, hey, I guess it's your choice.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Harper is the political player of the decade; PM has had a few stumbles, but he's grown into the job</b>
</div><div>L. IAN MACDONALD   </div>
<div>Freelance</div>
<div>927 words</div><div>30 December 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>There's no doubt that Stephen Harper is the player of the year in Canadian politics, and a very strong case can also be made that he's the player of the decade.</p>
<p>And this is a guy who, as the decade began, was out of politics, working as a lobbyist as head of the National Citizens' Coalition. Harper, who always saw himself as more of a backstage strategist, went on to become the leading political actor of the decade.</p>
<p>Consider: When Stockwell Day invited a challenge to his leadership of the Canadian Alliance in 2002, Harper stepped in where no one else would - and prevailed.</p>
<p>Then in 2003, Harper and Progressive Conservative leader Peter MacKay successfully completed a merger that united the right, a prerequisite for winning an election. More than a united right, Harper also got the PCs' most important asset - the Conservative brand, the one Canadian voters always turn to when they get tired of the Liberals.</p>
<p>That was the moment, just as Paul Martin was becoming Liberal leader, that a fourth consecutive majority slipped away from the Grits.</p>
<p>In the 2004 election, only a late surge of strategic voters to the Liberals saved Martin a minority government. It was also a good lesson for Harper. His team wasn't ready to govern, and the voters sensed it in the closing days of the campaign, in which the Conservatives allowed the Liberals to define their leader as a scary guy with a hidden agenda. It wouldn't happen again.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Conservatives staged a big policy convention in Montreal, where they took a lot of scary stuff like abortion, and Reform-era initiatives like recall of MPs, off the table.</p>
<p>In the 2006 election, Harper actually went into the campaign behind, but over the course of eight weeks, proved the point that campaigns matter. He announced five priorities for government - including a health-care guarantee and child-care allowances for parents - that got the attention of the middle class. In Quebec, his "open federalism" speech just before the holidays gave Quebecers a respectable alternative to the Liberals and the Bloc. It was no accident that his breakthrough in the polls in Quebec, resulting in 10 seats, occurred after Quebecers had discussed it over the Christmas holidays.</p>
<p>In 2008, Harper had only himself to blame for a missed rendezvous with a majority, as well as for the self-inflicted parliamentary crisis that nearly cost him his government.</p>
<p>But in 2009 he has been the Comeback Kid, thoroughly dominating politics and public policy on the federal stage. Aside from an unforced error by his office, when it stupidly suggested Brian Mulroney was no longer a member of a party he twice led to massive majorities, Harper has enjoyed a rise in the polls that has taken him once more to the threshold of majority territory.</p>
<p>Of course, he has also been fortunate in his opponents, first with Stéphane Dion in the 2008 election, and now with Michael Ignatieff giving a very good impersonation of Hamlet. To be or not to be in an election, that was the question for Iggy.</p>
<p>First Ignatieff said he had the government on a short leash, demanding quarterly updates as a condition of supporting the January budget. That only allowed Finance Minister Jim Flaherty to put out a quarterly statement, complete with graphs and charts, on what a great job the government was doing steering the economy through the recession to recovery.</p>
<p>Then Ignatieff famously said, "Mr. Harper, your time is up," a foolish declaration that left him no room to climb down except in the humbling way he finally did, taking it all back. Now his position is that there's no way he'll force an election in 2010. There doesn't seem to be much of a middle ground in Ignatieff's world, only extremes. Meanwhile, he has handed Jack Layton the balance of power, and the NDP leader, who enjoys being visible and relevant, is coming off his most effective session in the House.</p>
<p>Ignatieff can take some comfort in that a year ago Harper was in a bad place. Flaherty's listening tour, and his January budget, were instrumental in saving the government and reversing the political course of the year.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the government's message was twofold - first a steady hand on the wheel through the recession, and then staying in Ottawa to run the country's affairs through to an economic recovery. The core attribute of government is competence and the government has passed it, from the GM bailout to the H1N1 rollout.</p>
<p>But as the year and the decade end, the biggest change has been in Harper himself. From the February bilateral meeting with Barack Obama to a series of international summits, Harper has developed a comfort zone on the world stage, a role he will grow into more next year as he hosts the G8 and G20 summits.</p>
<p>At home, in the House and on the hustings, he has grown into the role, as well as the job, of prime minister.</p>
<p>All of which makes him Canada's political player of the year and, indeed, the decade.</p>

</p>
<p>The legislature speaker's office has ordered the Alberta Liberals to take down a website calling for Health Minister Ron Liepert's firing or resignation.</p>
<p>Speaker Ken Kowalski said the site " liepertmustgo.ca"is an inappropriate use of caucus funding, since it singles out one MLA for personal criticism.</p>
<p>"It is an important function for any caucus to communicate its positions on policy, including providing criticism of government policies," Kowalski said in a letter sent last week to the Liberals. "However, this communication goes beyond what is acceptable as it singles out and personally criticizes an individual member."</p>
<p>But the Liberals argue the website is no more personal than attacks in the legislature or in news releases. "We're not attacking anything personal about (Liepert), only his job performance and the direction he is taking," Liberal Leader David Swann said.</p>
<p>Liepert and Kowalski both declined to comment on the issue.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach has confirmed there will be a cabinet shuffle in the coming weeks and much speculation has centred on Liepert.</p>
<p>The Liberals took aim at Liepert during the fall sitting of the legislature and demanded his resignation over his handling of the H1N1 vaccination campaign and what they say is turmoil in the health care system.</p>
<p>The site was launched this month as a way for Albertans to share stories about the health care system.</p>
<p>Swann made no apologies for the harder edge to the party's communications. The Liberals say they will take their concerns to the member services committee, which has final say on such issues.</p>
<p>The Liberals could host the website from their parity site, which receives no public funding. But Swann said they're fighting on principle.</p>
<p>"Anything the government can do to suppress dissent and criticism is fair game for them," Swann said. "We're trying to give Albertans a voice."</p>

</p>
<p>It's the most important assist anyone will make this season in the Kanata Minor Hockey Association.</p>
<p>After 13-year-old Brodie Rafter was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in the fall, his Kanata Blazers bantam minor B team and the KMHA decided to lend a hand to help out Brodie and his Glen Cairn family while the defenceman undergoes treatment for the disease.</p>
<p>"When we found out, the team was really worried about his health and wanted to do what they could to help him and his family get better," Blazers coach Rob Levesque said. "He's a great kid and always has a smile on his face. He's very serious about his sports -- his hockey and his baseball.</p>
<p>"We're waiting for him to get better so he can get back on the ice with us."</p>
<p>Brodie, who competed in the Bell Capital Cup last year, had been playing with the Blazers in November when struck with a lingering illness. By the end of the month, he'd been diagnosed.</p>
<p>"At first, they thought it was the flu, with H1N1 going around, but he wasn't getting any better," said Dave Farnes, the KMHA's AA league rep.</p>
<p>Despite the devastating news, Levesque said the bravery, strength and sense of leadership Brodie showed in his own family following the diagnosis made him a natural choice for team captain because the team had yet to elect a captain.</p>
<p>The Blazers had the C put on his jersey, and it has hung behind the team bench for every game.</p>
<p>"Looking at that type of attitude was a really good source of inspiration for our team," Levesque said.</p>
<p>Brodie's teammates presented him with an iPod so he could stay connected while he undergoes chemotherapy at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario.</p>
<p>His mother, Tracey, was forced to give up the day-care facility she operated in order to look after Brodie, whose chemotherapy treatments last until spring, when he'll begin further radiation therapy.</p>
<p>"It's a pretty aggressive treatment," Farnes said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Kanata hockey community is pitching in to help out Brodie, Tracey, his father, Scott, and older brother Kyle.</p>
<p>KMHA president Charles Saunders declared the week of Jan. 10 Blazers for Brodie Week.</p>
<p>The Kanata Stallions of the Central Junior Hockey League will donate all gate receipts from their Jan. 12 game against Pembroke at the Kanata Recreation Complex to the family, the same day that A&B Sports will donate all of its skate-sharpening proceeds.</p>
<p>The association's Winter Classic tournament at the Bell Sensplex Jan. 15-17 will also feature various fundraisers. A Blazers for Brodie T-shirt and wristband are in the works and the KMHA is also accepting donations for the family.</p>
<p>The Ottawa Senators donated 25 pairs of 200-level tickets for Thursday night's game against the New York Islanders for the association to sell.</p>

<p>It was not the talk Dr. Michael Ossi planned to give when he was summoned to Washington in the fall of 2003 to brief health officials on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>Dr. Ossi, an infectious disease expert with British pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline PLC</span>, had been asked to meet with government officials on how to respond to a deadly problem unfolding halfway around the world.</p>
<p>In Asia, entire flocks of birds were dying from a virus called H5N1, better known as avian flu. A particularly virulent strain of influenza, H5N1 had for years been confined mostly to birds because their higher body temperatures provided an ideal environment for the bug to proliferate.</p>
<p>But pockets of people were becoming infected in Asia, setting off alarm bells for health officials around the globe. When it spread among humans, the consequences were unusually fatal. Roughly 60 per cent of those infected with H5N1 died, making it three times deadlier than the 1919 Spanish Flu, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Dr. Ossi came to the hastily arranged gathering of health officials and academics expecting to talk to them about his company's research into anti-viral drugs and flu vaccine. But the health experts clustered around a handful of tables were not interested in hearing about the science behind such products. They had much more pressing concerns.</p>
<p>They only had one question, Dr. Ossi recalls: “How much can you make and how fast can you make it?”</p>
<p>It was a watershed moment for him. For most of his career, working in vaccine research – indeed, most research related to the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases – was a ticket to obscurity at a big drug company. The high stakes and big profits for companies like Glaxo were not in vaccines, but in multibillion-dollar blockbuster drugs: the Wellbutrins, the Zantacs and the Valtrexes.</p>
<p>But the world was changing. Shoehorned into that meeting room in Washington were mathematicians from top universities, charged with calculating how many people could be protected in a pandemic; ethicists who would debate who should get medicine first in the event of a shortage; and public health officials struggling to find a way to cope with potentially tens of millions of infected people. Their urgency made it clear to Dr. Ossi that the quiet, unprofitable world of vaccines was about to be given more prominence in government than it had in decades.</p>
<p>H5N1 would alter government approaches to pandemic planning. But it would also create a new and unprecedented opportunity for the global pharmaceutical industry. It was, as Dr. Ossi recalls, “an obvious commercial opportunity” for the drug companies – one that is reshaping their businesses.</p>
<p>In a matter of a few years, flu shots have gone from being a marginal, money-losing business to a massive profit generator for a small number of global companies, as governments and the public hasten to protect themselves from getting sick.</p>
<p>Between 2004 and 2007, vaccine sales across the industry soared an average of 32 per cent each year, with flu vaccine leading the way. That is roughly four times faster than any other pharmaceutical product.</p>
<p>In a year that will be remembered for widespread public worry about the H1N1 virus, or swine flu, vaccines have become a $24-billion business. Analysts predict the global vaccine industry will top $40-billion by 2012. For companies like Glaxo, Sanofi-Aventis, Merck & Co., <span class="companylink">Novartis AG</span> and <span class="companylink">Pfizer Inc</span>., the fear of a pandemic has translated into a financial windfall that has been years in the making. Worldwide, nearly 1 billion doses of H1N1 vaccine have been ordered in 2009.</p>
<p>This is the story of how that happened – how Flu Inc. grew out of nowhere, transforming a once struggling business characterized by lab closures and lawsuits into a high-profit industry in less than a decade, and of the steps the pharmaceutical industry has taken to ensure the dollars keep flowing.</p>
<p>The change is driven by a new way of thinking in government about how to approach future threats of a flu pandemic. Health officials have begun to see merit in pursuing a strategy of stockpiling vaccines, even at a much higher cost per dose than they paid in the past.</p>
<p>Behind all this, of course, is a public that demands to be protected from the worst strains of influenza. This year, about 40 per cent of Canadians got the vaccine for H1N1 – the highest adoption of a flu shot the country has ever seen. Those shots are responsible for limiting the spread of the disease and, most likely, for saving lives. But even as the H1N1 threat subsides after killing more than 400 people in Canada, the business of fighting flu is arguably still in the early years of its growth.</p>
<p>“It was a new market, created by this pandemic scare,” Dr. Ossi said.</p>
<p>How the flu vaccine</p>
<p>industry was built</p>
<p>Vaccines have always been a business. They've just never been a very good business.</p>
<p>“We were losing money,” said Claude Vezeau, former chief executive officer at Montreal-based IAF BioChem International, Canada's largest maker of vaccines in the 1990s. “All vaccines were losing money.”</p>
<p>The problem has been rooted in the cumbersome process of vaccine production and in the public's complacency. Alan Davies, the head of Canada's famed Connaught Antitoxin Laboratory at the University of Toronto, once lamented: “People are willing to pay more for a bottle of headache tablets than they are for a vaccine that will protect them for many years.” Connaught, too, was a money-loser.</p>
<p>The idea of inoculating people against disease dates back to 1796, when British doctor Edward Jenner noticed that milkmaids exposed to cow pox appeared to be immune from smallpox.</p>
<p>More than two centuries later, making vaccines on a large scale remains challenging. Vaccines are still made primarily from tiny bits of pathogens, the disease-causing agents of a virus. It can take months to get the formula right, and flu viruses are always changing. The manufacturing process is also clunky and relies on techniques developed 50 years ago in which a virus is injected into chicken eggs to multiply.</p>
<p>Heavy regulation and a lack of a broad customer base – governments are the primary buyers – left many drug companies with little incentive to make vaccines. Why spend time on such a low-margin business as vaccines when a company could make a fortune developing a new blockbuster drug?</p>
<p>In Canada, where vaccine making was once largely left to public institutions, the picture was no brighter. The country's largest facility, the Connaught lab, earned fame as the site of Frederick Banting and Charles Best's insulin discovery. But it struggled financially for years before being bought by French drug giant <span class="companylink">Sanofi-Aventis</span>.</p>
<p>Canada's other large vaccine facility, the Institute Armand-Frappier in Quebec City, didn't fare much better. By the mid 1980s, its owner, the University of Quebec, could no longer shoulder the financial burden, and the facility was sold to Mr. Vezeau's IAF BioChem – which also struggled.</p>
<p>How the world changed for vaccines</p>
<p>But all of that began to change with the first hint of a pandemic on the other side of the world.</p>
<p>The outbreak of H5N1 in Hong Kong in 1997 was relatively small – just 18 people who handled birds – but six of them died. Such a high death rate drew immediate attention from medical experts around the world. Fears of a much bigger death toll began to percolate at government levels.</p>
<p>Like many countries, Canada began working on a pandemic preparedness plan. Led by John Spika, a senior infectious disease official at Health Canada, federal and provincial bureaucrats began drawing up models of a potential outbreak that could kill up to 58,000 Canadians and do $30-billion worth of damage to the economy. The key to fighting such an outbreak, they believed, was securing an abundant supply of vaccine.</p>
<p>Dr. Spika and others in the vaccine community warned that if a serious pandemic broke out, countries would close their borders and hoard vaccine. Governments began setting aside money in federal budgets for pandemic preparations. Ottawa also began negotiating a long-term vaccine supply agreement with BioChem, which had the only flu vaccine facility in Canada.</p>
<p>For Mr. Vezeau at BioChem, pandemic planning was a godsend. Suddenly, he had the attention of government officials. “We were losing money, so we went to the government and said, ‘Listen, for this to be a viable manufacturer, we need to increase the price of our vaccine,” Mr. Vezeau said. They got a higher price.</p>
<p>The government pursued contract negotiations with BioChem on a deal that was potentially so lucrative it began to push the value of the company higher. Before it was even signed, Shire Biologics stepped in and purchased BioChem in 2001. Soon after, the company signed a 10-year pact with Ottawa that would see the Quebec facility responsible for producing flu shots for every Canadian in a pandemic.</p>
<p>Dr. Spika called the deal “a cheap insurance policy” for the country. At a price tag of $300-million, it was more money than the vaccine maker had ever seen before.</p>
<p>Other vaccine companies began to negotiate similar large-scale contracts in dozens of countries, from Switzerland to France and even such smaller nations as Iceland.</p>
<p>However, one problem remained for the vaccine manufacturers as governments around the world began doling out money for contracts. Like any virus, flu will only grow in living cells. One of the best places to grow it for the purposes of vaccine making is in fertilized chicken eggs. But the process is slow and hard to use on a mass scale; it can take as many as three eggs to make one shot of flu vaccine. “They have to use chicken embryos and there isn't enough supply of those readily available to be able to make tons of vaccine,” Dr. Ossi said.</p>
<p>Fighting pandemic flu with vaccine made from eggs alone would be a losing battle, many believed. Companies needed to find a way to increase the amount of vaccine that could be produced in order to capitalize on the growth. And that particular discovery was already in the works.</p>
<p>The problem with</p>
<p>making vaccines</p>
<p>For years, scientists had tried to find a faster way to make vaccines. They chased a variety of theories, including isolating the DNA of a virus, which many researchers believed would unlock new ways to fight infections. But at its main vaccine facility in Rixensart, Belgium, Glaxo had found a way to make vaccines more potent using another kind of technology: adjuvants.</p>
<p>Adjuvants are like superchargers for vaccines. They are mild contaminants, such as salt or oil, that cause the body to respond with a more intense immune response. When paired with antigens, the adjuvant liquid can make the vaccine's impact stronger. This allows for more doses to be produced from less antigen.</p>
<p>“It allows us to decrease the antigen content, which allows us to multiply the capacity,” said Philippe Monteyne, senior vice-president of global vaccines development at Glaxo. “And of course, multiplying the capacity has some impacts on the business side,” boosting profits.</p>
<p>Adjuvants allowed companies to pump out more, but it is also a higher-margin business than antigens.</p>
<p>Significantly more than half the price of a dose of flu vaccine is attributable to the adjuvant, though Glaxo doesn't disclose the exact figures. “That's why vaccines became so attractive,” Mr. Monteyne said. “Most of the value in our case is put on the adjuvant technology.”</p>
<p>For the drug companies, the new interest in vaccines by governments looking to get as many flu shots as they could buy, and the scientific advances of adjuvants, came at an opportune time.</p>
<p>Many drug makers were starting to worry about the long-term viability of megadrugs like Lipitor, a cholesterol fighter, and Zantac, an ulcer treatment, that have a finite period of patent protection. When the patents expire, the market is flooded with cheaper generic versions. The big drug companies needed a new source of revenue, and the advent of large-scale vaccine manufacturing looked promising.</p>
<p>With the value of vaccines on the rise with the fears of avian flu, the drug companies also liked something else about the resurgent business: they had it to themselves.</p>
<p>Because vaccine making is so expensive – a new plant can cost up to $1-billion (U.S.) – companies like Glaxo, <span class="companylink">Novartis</span> and <span class="companylink">Sanofi-Aventis</span> didn't have to worry about a rash of new entrants cutting into the flu vaccine business as governments ordered millions of doses.</p>
<p>“The barriers to enter the market are extremely high,” said Mr. Monteyne in Belgium. “You don't become a vaccine maker over night. That's why we have a few big players, and very few only.” That meant the giants could push hard to increase prices. And they did.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Sanofi-Aventis</span> expects to earn close to $6-billion (U.S.) in vaccine revenue next year and double its sales by 2013. This quarter, sales of H1N1 vaccine alone will top $500-million. It is suddenly a good time to be a flu shot maker.</p>
<p>“Vaccines, vaccines, wonderful business,” Chris Viehbacher, the Canadian-born CEO of <span class="companylink">Sanofi-Aventis</span>, told investment analysts on a conference call a few months ago.</p>
<p>It didn't take long for such calculations to be made in other boardrooms around the globe. The companies began acting quickly to expand: <span class="companylink">Novartis</span> spent $5-billion to buy U.S.-based flu vaccine maker Chrion. Britain's Astra Zeneca paid $15-billion for <span class="companylink">Medimmune</span>, and Glaxo purchased the old BioChem vaccine operation in Quebec for $1.4-billion.</p>
<p>With 22 per cent of the market, Glaxo was now the global leader in vaccines. And with that clout came the power to influence governments, who were already fearful about not having enough vaccine supply in the event of a pandemic.</p>
<p>How vaccines are sold and prices are set</p>
<p>In the summer of 2008, Jim Flaherty's staff prepared a briefing note for an upcoming meeting with the head of Glaxo's Canadian operations, Paul Lucas.</p>
<p>Glaxo had been lobbying several governments around the world to get higher vaccine prices and access to massive cash reserves countries were setting aside to cope with a pandemic threat.</p>
<p>“We understand that Mr. Lucas would like to discuss how GSK could further contribute to Canada's pandemic preparedness, including [Ottawa] setting aside $400-million as a contingency fund,” the note said, according to documents obtained by Ottawa researcher Ken Rubin.</p>
<p>Mr. Flaherty held the purse strings on any national pandemic plan and subsequent vaccine purchase from Glaxo. The company had a message for the minister: “GSK has been critical … contending that the proposed vaccine price is too low,” Mr. Flaherty's staff told him.</p>
<p>Indeed, the company had already been lobbying governments well before then. Since the late 1990s, prices for flu vaccine in North America have soared from $2 per dose to as high as $12 in 2007. The price has recently fallen back to about $8 as buying volumes increased in the face of H1N1. But that's still a healthy margin, as some analysts estimate it costs about $1 to make each dose.</p>
<p>The company does not discuss its costs, but Mr. Monteyne said the cost of a flu shot is flexible depending on whether the buyer can pay more. “We have a tiered pricing strategy,” Mr. Monteyne said. “It is mainly based on the level of income of the country.”</p>
<p>Beyond just selling crates of vaccine, Glaxo also wants to sell full-service protection – pandemic readiness packages. And the industry's desire to build a stable business out of vaccines, along with the emergence of adjuvants, has led to perhaps the most significant shift the industry has seen in decades: the creation of vaccine stockpiles.</p>
<p>Switzerland was the first country to jump in. In October, 2006, with fear over H5N1 at fever pitch, the Swiss signed a contract with Glaxo on a stockpiling deal that called for 8 million doses of avian flu vaccine, slightly more than one shot for every citizen.</p>
<p>Then, in a new kind of move for the industry, the Swiss reserved future space on the production line for another 8 million doses if needed. That meant Swiss health authorities had priority in line at Glaxo's factories if a second dose were needed.</p>
<p>This emerging business – pre-pandemic treatment – was rounding into shape. Glaxo began trade-marking the names of vaccines along those lines, registering its vaccines as Prepandrix.</p>
<p>Other nations soon followed the Swiss with deals of their own, locking up huge sales for Glaxo.</p>
<p>There was just one problem: the H5N1 pandemic never happened. The virus stayed mostly with animals. The Swiss were left with one of the world's largest stockpiles of unused H5N1 flu vaccine. Glaxo's sales of avian flu vaccine fell 54 per cent in 2008, as countries realized their stockpiles weren't needed.</p>
<p>This was a problem for the vaccine makers, who were looking to build an enduring revenue stream rather than simply capitalizing on flu fears to gain a temporary spike in sales. Glaxo's new CEO, who had been elevated from the ranks of the company's vaccine division, understood this.</p>
<p>How the new vaccine market was born</p>
<p>Barely a year into his tenure as Glaxo's chief executive officer, Andrew Witty outlined the company's achievements during a conference call in October. Quarterly profit was up 30 per cent from a year earlier, orders for H1N1 flu vaccines had topped 400 million doses and the company was close to becoming the world's largest vaccine maker.</p>
<p>“I think the momentum of this business is going in the right direction,” Mr. Witty told analysts. In short, Glaxo's big bet on vaccines was bearing fruit. And perhaps most surprisingly, the Swiss were buying again, despite having spent millions on H5N1 vaccine it never used.</p>
<p>This, Mr. Witty explained, was the brilliance of the new vaccine market. Glaxo had turned the Swiss situation into an opportunity to sell more vaccine.</p>
<p>Because adjuvant could be paired with any antigen, the leftover stockpiles could be used for other outbreaks by simply plugging in a different antigen, depending on which virus looked most threatening.</p>
<p>Once a country bought a large supply of adjuvant, it was locked in as a buyer for Glaxo's antigen for years to come. Countries were not just vaccine buyers now; they were subscribers, coming back annually to the company for more and different types of shots.</p>
<p>“If you go with an adjuvanted technology, you can actually keep a stockpile of your adjuvant and then simply rotate a new antigen in at the last minute,” Mr. Witty said.</p>
<p>That is basically what the leading countries like Switzerland did.</p>
<p>“The real business is a business of stockpiling. It is not a reactive market. It is something that is proactively being built with governments,” Mr. Monteyne said.</p>
<p>Other countries, including Canada, took notice of what the Swiss were doing. In the past 12 months, the number of countries using such stockpiling methods has grown to 60 from less than 10. When H1N1 broke out and temporary vaccine shortages occurred, Canadians learned that the federal government has become a big buyer of adjuvants.</p>
<p>As far as the vaccine makers are concerned, adjuvants are the future because they encourage countries to stockpile what they've bought from the drug companies. Asked by an analyst whether the company could keep generating the record vaccine profits it saw in 2009, Mr. Witty didn't hesitate: Yes, it could.</p>
<p>“What's been created this summer is essentially a stockpiling marketplace, which over a period of time will have to be refreshed,” Mr. Witty told analysts. “And that's exactly where we see there being some kind of steady state” for the vaccine industry.</p>
<p>New fears over H1N1 were the catalyst to a completely new way of buying and selling vaccines that many countries are expected to follow. Flu shots are now a product for the masses. Non-seasonal flu shots such as H1N1 could become a yearly norm.</p>
<p>Soaring vaccine sales are also pushing companies to chase profit in other types of shots. The race is now on to develop blockbuster vaccines, defined as those that bring in more than $1-billion annually. Two recently developed vaccines – Prevnar for pneumonia and Garasil for cervical cancer – have become blockbusters, selling close to $2-billion a year.</p>
<p>For now, though, the flu is the driver of all of this.</p>
<p>Flu Inc. is fed by the worry of the unknown, the fears of government that the next pandemic lies just around the corner, or tucked away in some far off area of the world. In the case of H1N1, the threat of illness for 40 per cent of the country was real enough that they went for the shot, sometimes lining up for hours to get it. And that has spawned a new business.</p>
<p>“We are just at the early days of a new era which is just exploding,” Mr. Monteyne said. “The whole vaccine industry is changing.”</p>
<p>Dr. Ossi sees it as a permanent shift in habits. “The volume of vaccine that countries are asking for has gone up exponentially,” he said.</p>
<p>“How many people got flu shots five years ago? Even the very high-risk people out there – the elderly, with chronic lung disease – only 60 per cent of those were vaccinated. Otherwise, many healthy people never thought of getting the flu vaccine.</p>
<p>“Now, all of a sudden, there's a huge demand and a lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon. It's something that will continue for good now. It's a new marketplace.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>MAKING FLU VACCINE WORK</p>
<p>How it's made</p>
<p>Like any virus, flu will only grow in living cells. One of the best places to grow it is in fertilized chicken eggs. (Pigs and humans are also good, but less practical.) Eleven days after the egg is fertilized, a hole is drilled into the eggshell and the virus is injected into the fluid surrounding the embryo. After the virus infects the embryo, it multiplies. Machines then crack open the eggs and the virus-filled fluid is removed.</p>
<p>The virus is chemically inactivated, usually with formaldehyde, and used as the “antigen” of a flu shot, which is short for antibody generator. When injected into the body, it's the antigen that provokes an immune response that remembers the code of the virus it encounters.</p>
<p>The antigen-making process can take months because the eggs have to be at the right maturity. The virus also grows slowly and it can take as many as three eggs to make one shot of flu vaccine. Then there are the chickens that produce the eggs – they have to be kept in steady supply, and healthy, since producing enough vaccine for an entire country can take millions of eggs.</p>
<p>What is adjuvant?</p>
<p>The word itself comes from the Latin “adjuvare” which means to help or aid. Adjuvant is a liquid substance used to help boost the flu vaccine and make it work better. Adjuvant also makes it possible to manufacture more doses with the same amount of antigen. Adjuvants can include oils, salts and virosomes, which are bits of influenza virus that cannot replicate.</p>

<p>It crept upon us and now it's gone in what seems a flash.</p>
<p>Christmas Day is over, the preparations, the gift buying, the extra food for family and friends who came to visit.</p>
<p>It was a lot of work. But the big question remains: was it all worth it?</p>
<p>For many it's far from over yet as we are still in the midst of the Yuletide season, with New Year's festivities yet to come. Many have holidays and take advantage of them to visit and receive others. It's a great time of the year to reconnect with family and friends.</p>
<p>For most, the memories of the turn of the century are still fresh in our minds. Remember the fear of the millennium bug and how there were global fears of computers failing, lights going out and a multitude of other problems? It's now a decade behind us. The new fear is the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>Going into a new year and a new decade requires a positive attitude with the hopes things will get better, the economy will bounce back and life will be a little better. We've survived Christmas, we survived the millennium bug a full decade ago, and while the H1N1 pandemic was devastating for some, the majority has survived it.</p>
<p>Let's enter a new year full of hope that things will improve for everyone.</p>

</p>
<p>In his wildest dreams, Greg Selinger never saw it coming.</p>
<p>Manitoba's former finance minister started 2009 preoccupied with the global recession. There was a budget to consider, negotiations on a federal-provincial stimulus package and preparations for an H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>But a leadership race? With Premier Gary Doer still enjoying unbridled popularity, there was no hint change was coming.</p>
<p>"I thought we were going to work for a fourth mandate with the team we had," Selinger said in a recent interview. "I think that was the feeling of the majority of us. With the recession, (thought of a leadership change) wasn't anywhere near the top of my mind."</p>
<p>Politics is a volatile game but the events that unfolded in Manitoba this year were nothing less than seismic. Doer's resignation and his decision to take a position as Canada's ambassador in Washington hit the reset button on Manitoba's political economy.</p>
<p>What seemed to be certain is now decidedly uncertain. This includes the province's economic prospects and the outcome of the next provincial election, scheduled by law for 2011.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the flu and the recession, the pre-eminent provincial political story of 2009 was the story behind Doer's resignation. The exact details remain largely unknown although there are hints he was contemplating an exit as early as the spring.</p>
<p>Political sources from different stripes began picking up on rumours of Doer's departure over the summer. However, the circle of those who knew for sure was kept small and tight by Doer in Winnipeg and Prime Minister Stephen Harper in Ottawa.</p>
<p>NDP insiders confirmed Doer was incredibly discreet about his master plan. His most senior political staff was kept in the dark until the day before or the morning of his resignation.</p>
<p>Few considered Doer a candidate for the post in Washington. In fact, most national media continued focusing on a wide array of the usual suspects. This was the case even after Doer announced his resignation; most national reports hypothesized the Manitoba first minister would take a run at federal politics.</p>
<p>One of the biggest unintended consequences of this strategy was Doer's colleagues in cabinet and caucus, and the party itself, had virtually no warning and no chance to prepare.</p>
<p>Lamentably, the NDP did not react well to Doer's departure. With no immediate prospect for an election, the party inexplicably designed a rash and expedited leadership process that lasted less than 60 days. In the end, it had little democratic integrity.</p>
<p>Leadership candidates scrambled to raise money, secure support from the caucus and wage ground wars to capture delegates in all 57 ridings. Organized labour impaired the process, insisting on a delegate-selection system that awarded automatic delegates to unions. In the end, the unions could not find enough members who wanted to attend the leadership convention, and were forced to return delegate spots to the party. Allegations of cheating and counter-allegations of character assassination bloodied the campaign.</p>
<p>In the end, Selinger ran the best campaign and captured the premier's office. However, it may be that winning may turn out to be one of those "be careful what you wish for" triumphs.</p>
<p>This past week, the province's second-quarter fiscal update was released. It showed that what had been projected to be a $40-million or so surplus this year may turn out to be a $600-million deficit. Despite posting perhaps the best economic performance this year among the provinces, Manitoba is facing the same precipitous drop in revenues that has ravaged treasuries all over Canada.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago, Selinger was trumpeting the fact that Manitoba's economy was technically flat, but that "flat was the new up." Selinger suggested the next year was likely to be very tough, but following the throne speech, he specifically ruled out cuts to core services or layoffs. The Q2 update is certainly food for rethinking that.</p>
<p>In an interview, Selinger denied soft-pedalling the economic predicament now facing the province. However, while just a few weeks ago he did not see severe deficit-fighting measures, he is now more circumspect about the strategy for next year's budget.</p>
<p>That does not mean he appears panicky about the growing deficit. Selinger understands that notwithstanding the efforts of critics and enemies to blame the deficit on mismanagement, this is a condition brought on by issues much bigger than Manitoba's per capita spending on health care.</p>
<p>Under Manitoba's new and improved balanced-budget law, Selinger has four years to return the budget to surplus.</p>
<p>If there is a flaw in Selinger's strategy, it may be that a four-year window to slay the deficit will be interrupted in two years by the next provincial election. And that means Tory Leader Hugh McFadyen will have his best chance, maybe ever, to topple the NDP machine.</p>
<p>Tory rank and file can smell opportunity with Doer gone and Selinger managing a growing deficit. But it will take more than just a budget deficit to defeat the NDP, and that appears to be what the eager McFadyen has anticipated.</p>
<p>No Doer, no surplus and a more focused Tory campaign will make the next election more competitive, that is a certainty. But if Selinger does not go early, and he has more or less indicated he will not, he has one more year to get a handle on the treasury and solidify his profile as leader of his party and province.</p>
<p>Two years could be enough time, or it could expire in the blink of an eye. Either way, the next two years will be the most important of Selinger's political life.</p>

<p>Byelection for</p>
<p>Doer's old seat</p>
<p>A provincial byelection to fill former premier Gary Doer's old seat in northeast Winnipeg will likely be held before the legislature resumes sitting March 23, a provincial spokesman said Tuesday.</p>
<p>But first Premier Greg Selinger has to call a voting date for the Concordia constituency and the Progressive Conservatives and Liberals have to select candidates. The government spokesman said ideally the vote would be held before the end of March so that the new MLA could take his or her seat when the province tables its new budget.</p>
<p>The seat was left open when Doer became Canada's ambassador to the United States.</p>
<p>In November, longtime party insider Matt Wiebe was selected at a nomination meeting as the NDP candidate for the Concordia riding. Wiebe worked as Doer's constituency assistant.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Post mortem on H1N1 flu</b>
</div><div>618 words</div><div>30 December 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>With the H1N1 flu virus now fading, Canada's public health experts, scientists, and political leaders should shift their emphasis from fighting the pandemic to analyzing the vaccination campaign, with an eye to what went wrong and how to do better next time.</p>
<p>Frontline doctors, nurses and public health officials worked extraordinarily hard and managed to immunize more than 40 per cent of Canadians. But some weaknesses in the system stood starkly revealed.</p>
<p>Response to this pandemic was distressingly uneven, with access to potentially life-saving shots varying greatly from one region to another and even between health units in the same province. For example, while crowds forced Toronto to shut down its two initial H1N1 vaccine clinics just hours after opening them, Sault Ste. Marie was immunizing residents with military precision. That's because the Soo had set up an efficient registry in advance.</p>
<p>Distribution flaws in several provinces saw small children and other high-risk persons stuck in long line-ups while sports stars and hospital insiders received priority treatment. And the federal government opted to contract with one pharmaceutical manufacturer for the vaccine rather than spread the task among several. That led to serious production delays.</p>
<p>It is little wonder, then, that the H1N1 virus was chosen by Canada's newspaper editors and broadcast news directors as the top news story of 2009. But it wasn't all bad news.</p>
<p>Unless the H1N1 virus mutates in some unexpected way and manages a rebound, Canadians, as a group, should consider themselves lucky. While more than 400 H1N1-related deaths have been reported in Canada, even an average flu season typically kills thousands.</p>
<p>The pandemic appears to have peaked in mid-November. Canadian hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and deaths have dropped steadily since then. There are similar results elsewhere, with the World Health Organization reporting just over 11,500 global fatalities related to the H1N1 virus. That's a relative pittance compared to the toll of past pandemics.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the H1N1 virus served as a useful dry run, sharpening our pandemic response. To take advantage of it, however, we need an in-depth and unbiased look at what went wrong, coupled with a commitment to fix the problems.</p>
<p>Some steps seem obvious, such as signing contracts with more than one pharmaceutical company to produce the vaccine. Others will be more difficult to implement. For example, Canada clearly needs a centralized, efficient and truly national public health system, but bureaucratic and constitutional barriers stand in the way.</p>
<p>Even without a national system, however, Ontario could take some meaningful steps toward correcting problems within its own borders. The H1N1 vaccine was delivered by the province's 36 public health units, which were clearly overwhelmed by the task. Other provinces managed better with fewer delivery units. Next time, Ontario should consider handing the assignment to its 14 Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs), which can call on the resources of hospitals and clinics to assist in distribution.</p>
<p>The best practises deployed in various parts of the country, such as in the Soo, should be studied and borrowed. After a crisis, the various health authorities would do this sort of analysis as a matter of course. But Canada's response to the H1N1 pandemic should be subject to a broader review, perhaps by an expert panel struck for that purpose.</p>
<p>Time is of the essence. Pandemics can erupt and spread with startling speed. It is worth noting that the current H1N1 outbreak only began in March. As this pandemic wanes, it is prudent of us to start preparing for the next one. Because next time we might not be so lucky.</p>

</p>
<p>Editor's Note: This is the second instalment of a two-part series</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>From potash to pork, agriculture to assets, the 2009 year in business saw highlights and lowlights in the industries that affect the Saskatoon region every day.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the top business stories that took place during the second-half of the year:</p>
<p>JULY</p>
<p>- TD Economics downgraded its 2009 economic forecast for Saskatchewan, estimating the province would see a one per cent drop in gross domestic product this year instead of the 0.4 per cent increase it had forecast in March. The drop was caused by a less bullish outlook on potash, agriculture and oil.</p>
<p>- After <span class="companylink">PotashCorp</span> released second-quarter earnings $700 million lower than the same period in 2008, the provincial government said it would rework its 2009-10 budget as it became clear the $1.9 billion it once expected from potash sales this year would not be realized. The government had expected to take in nearly $2 billion on sales of potash at $550 US per tonne.</p>
<p>- Stomp Pork Farms Inc. sold off its inventory after it and Stomp Pork Farm USA Inc. went into receivership earlier in the summer. Court documents show the inventory was sold as a result of depressed hog prices, a high Canadian dollar and the effects of the H1N1 or "swine flu" virus on the industry.</p>
<p>- Real estate: 440 homes sold at an average price of $283,619. (All residential real estate figures are from the Saskatoon Region Association of Realtors. The association finds the average residential price by dividing the dollar volume of homes sold by the number of homes sold.)</p>
<p>AUGUST</p>
<p>- The Saskatchewan Environmental Society (SES) called on the province to immediately pause the development of Saskatchewan's oilsands reserves pending a thorough environmental assessment of the northwestern oilsands zone and a public consultation on future development. The SES said it didn't want the province, which is in the early stages of developing the oilsands industry, to make the same mistakes that have "plagued the oilsands development in Alberta."</p>
<p>- The University of Saskatchewan's Edwards school of business announced the opening of a downtown campus. The K.W. Nasser Centre, named after the man who made the campus a reality, is home to the school's master of business administration program.</p>
<p>- A pre-feasibility study prepared for <span class="companylink">Shore Gold Inc</span>. indicated the Saskatoon company's Star diamond project could produce 20 million carats at a weighted average price of $265 per carat over 12 years for a total of $5.3 billion. The study said construction on an open-pit mine at the site in east-central Saskatchewan could start as early as 2010.</p>
<p>- Real estate: 393 homes sold at an average price of $281,871.</p>
<p>SEPTEMBER</p>
<p>- Saskatoon's Urban Playground organization, which is dedicated to making the city an attractive place for youth to live, learn and work, released a report showing the region stands to lose $417 million during the next two years if the flight of young talent from the city continues. The report, Attracting and Retaining Talent to Saskatoon, indicates 12 per cent of residents under 40 plan to leave the city within the next 24 months.</p>
<p>- The shareholders of <span class="companylink">Athabasca Potash Inc</span>. (API) voted in a new board of directors at the company's annual meeting. The board that won the vote was led by company founder Dawn Zhou, who was ousted from her position as president and CEO by the former board during the summer.</p>
<p>- A conference on innovation, networking and creativity made its debut at TCU Place. Backed by the W. Brett Wilson Centre for Entrepreneurial Excellence at the University of Saskatchewan, the Sask INC Innovation Forum attracted between 200 and 250 participants.</p>
<p>- Real estate: 351 homes sold at an average price of $279,457.</p>
<p>OCTOBER</p>
<p>- Karnalyte Resources Inc. announced plans to develop a $287-million US solution mine and processing plant near Wynyard to gain access to carnallite, a mineral that contains the same type of potassium potash firms mine, as well as magnesium. The company, which is in the early stages of the process, said the project could be up and running within two years.</p>
<p>- The <span class="companylink">Canadian Wheat Board</span> (CWB) opened a grain testing lab at Innovation Place. The farmer-controlled organization explained it is moving to test Prairie grain itself rather than send it to third-party laboratories.</p>
<p>- <span class="companylink">PotashCorp</span> announced a third-quarter drop in net earnings of nearly $1 billion from the same quarter last year. Company president and CEO Bill Doyle said at the time drop was a result of an economic crisis that "cut deeper and lasted longer" than the company initially anticipated.</p>
<p>- Real estate: 311 homes sold at an average price of $274,759.</p>
<p>NOVEMBER</p>
<p>- After announcing in August it had placed Saskatoon on its shortlist of candidates to host a $150-million processing plant, <span class="companylink">Fortune Minerals Ltd</span>. confirmed the Saskatoon region is its best choice for the facility. The company said the plant, which will process ore from its Nico project in the Northwest Territories, will be located near Langham.</p>
<p>- <span class="companylink">Big Sky Farms Inc</span>. filed for creditor protection after a lengthy downturn in the hog market led Saskatchewan's largest hog producer to take the financial action. The move, which gives the company time to create a restructuring plan, caused outrage among local producers owed money by the company, resulting in a blockade at one of Big Sky's facilities and a rally at the legislature. Documents show the company owes its creditors $96 million.</p>
<p>- Local farmers, especially those north of Saskatoon, take advantage of balmy weather in the race to finish harvest before winter arrived. Harvest had been delayed by cool, wet weather through October.</p>
<p>- Real estate: 254 homes sold at an average price of $278,885.</p>
<p>DECEMBER</p>
<p>- BHP Billiton, which has its eyes set on developing the Jansen potash project in east-central Saskatchewan, announced plans to move from its Innovation Place office to a new home in downtown Saskatoon's Discovery Plaza early in the new year. The company opened an office in the city in 2008.</p>
<p>- <span class="companylink">Cameco Corp</span>. moved to sell its 48.5 per cent stake in <span class="companylink">Centerra Gold Inc</span>. for net proceeds of $872 million. The Saskatoon-based company said it is selling off its gold asset in order to better focus on its uranium business.</p>
<p>- A lack of uranium ore will lead to an indefinite shutdown of <span class="companylink">Areva Resources Canada Inc</span>.'s McClean Lake mill in July 2010, the company announced mid-month. The move to put the mill into a "care and maintenance mode" will result in 140 layoffs, 120 at McClean Lake and 20 in the company's Saskatoon office.</p>

<p>Shame on each and every individual who received the H1N1 vaccine knowing they were, in no way, in the five priority groups designated as at risk.</p>
<p>All of you who did this, no exceptions, have placed the lives of those most vulnerable at risk.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest that you say a prayer, and if you don't believe in God, then at least hope that not one Ottawa resident who should get a priority vaccination yet couldn't due to long lineups or vaccine shortages, gets sick and succumbs to this virus.</p>
<p>And all because you made yourself a priority.</p>

<p>I'm writing about my absolutely amazing experience at the H1N1 clinic for pregnant women at The Ottawa Hospital, Riverside campus.</p>
<p>Never have I met such a thoroughly trained, organized and positive group of individuals. Each and every person I encountered during my visit, from the parking lot attendants (who did not charge any parking fees), the entrance greeters, to the volunteers helping patients sign in and direct us through the corridors, to the nurse who administered my vaccine and the others who monitored us following the vaccination.</p>
<p>Each step of the procedure was cared for in great detail and each volunteer was as positive and helpful as the one before. I was truly left speechless by the fantastic organization and pleasantness of each individual working there today. If this wasn't enough, there was absolutely no wait time, aside from the customary 15 minutes post-vaccination to monitor for adverse reactions.</p>
<p>After all the horror stories about lineups and wait times, I felt compelled to share this positive experience and recognize the hard work and diligence of all the people who were involved in setting up and running this clinic today. Thank you and well done!</p>

<p>U.S. registers increase in birth rate after decline</p>
<p>Birth rates in the United States are climbing after years of significant declines, according to an annual report in the journal Pediatrics.</p>
<p>Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the number of U.S. births for 2007 had jumped 1 per cent to 4,265,555.</p>
<p>The new number represents "the highest number ever registered for the United States," they said.</p>
<p>Almost 1.9 million people joined the population due to "natural increase," which is basically the net birth rate.</p>
<p>As the birth rate rose, the age-adjusted death rate dropped 2.1 per cent, a record low for the United States.</p>
<p>Life expectancy at birth reached a record high of 77.9 years.</p>
<p>One shocker: The U.S.'s infant death rate is 6.83 per 1,000 births. Compare that with Malaysia (6.2) or Korea (3.8).</p>
<p>And in the U.S. capital, the District of Columbia? It's nearly double the national rate, at 12.22.</p>
<p>Younger mothers, particularly adolescents, pushed the birth rate higher.</p>
<p>From 1991 through 2005, teen birth rates dropped 34 per cent. Since 2005, though, they've popped back up 5 per cent.</p>
<p>In terms of teen-pregnancy prevention, the study's authors conclude, "it could be that new messages and strategies are needed to reach the teenagers of today."</p>
<p>Click off the TV and burn more calories</p>
<p>Just push yourself away from the television. You will burn more calories.</p>
<p>Overweight adults who watched three hours of TV a day and cut their viewing in half for three weeks used about 120 more calories a day than a similar group of viewers, who continued watching five hours a day on average, a research trial has found.</p>
<p>While 120 calories may not sound like much, it is equivalent to the number of calories burned in a 1.6-kilometre walk, said Jennifer J. Otten, lead author of the paper published in the Archives of Internal Medicine.</p>
<p>"If you add it up over time, it's equivalent to walking eight miles (12.8 kilometres) a week.</p>
<p>"Over a year, it might help prevent weight gain of 12 pounds."</p>
<p>Unlike children whose television time is cut, the adults did not eat less. But they spent more time in light physical activities or sedentary activities that burn more calories than watching television does -- reading, playing board games or scrapbooking.</p>
<p>Body language unmasks racism in TV shows</p>
<p>A new study suggests one doesn't have to say a word to communicate racism.</p>
<p>Researchers at Massachusetts' Tufts University found white characters in scripted television shows display far more negative body language toward their black characters than to members of their own race.</p>
<p>The researchers examined 11 television programs, including Bones, Grey's Anatomy, CSI and Scrubs. They say the scenes they examined portrayed the black characters as social and intellectual peers to the white characters.</p>
<p>Still, researchers found positive body language such as smiling, nodding and leaning forward while talking is far less common when white characters engage with their black co-stars.</p>
<p>The study is in the Dec. 18 edition of the journal Science.</p>
<p>Swine flu is a threat to new moms</p>
<p>A new study finds swine flu is not only dangerous to pregnant women, but it's also a threat to new mothers.</p>
<p>An analysis of pregnant women and new mothers who were hospitalized with swine flu in California found that those who had a baby in the previous two weeks were at higher risk of severe flu complications.</p>
<p>The new report, released last week by the New England Journal of Medicine, is the first to look at the risk to women who recently gave birth. The study was done by the California Department of Public Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Out of his comfort zone and into the hot seat - Year-end interview with Premier Greg Selinger</b>
</div><div>By Bruce Owen and Larry Kusch   </div>
<div>1265 words</div><div>29 December 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>FIVE months ago, Greg Selinger was comfortably tucked away in a first-floor Manitoba legislature office as finance minister, a job he'd held for 10 years.</p>
<p>The recession was about a year old, but Manitoba's economy was humming along compared with other provinces.</p>
<p>Coming off a summer break, Selinger's only focus was staying the course.</p>
<p>Then, on the morning of Aug. 27, everything changed.</p>
<p>Gary Doer stunned almost everyone by announcing he was stepping down as premier. (A day later, he was appointed Canada's ambassador to the United States.)</p>
<p>Within seconds, the methodical Selinger felt that tingling in the gut you get when a big decision has to be made.</p>
<p>It took him a while -- it's his style, he never rushes into things -- but the former university associate professor of social work decided to throw his hat into the ring. It was a three-way race for premier, but looking back, few had any doubt Doer's second-floor office was Selinger's for the taking.</p>
<p>Now, more than two months into the job, the 58-year-old sat down with the Free Press to talk about what's ahead. Here's an edited version of that discussion:</p>
<p>FP: What have you learned about being a premier that you didn't know before?</p>
<p>Selinger: I'm not sure there's something I've learned that's new. But the reality is it's always different actually doing it versus being close to the person doing it. In my case, I've just been out more, less in the cabinet room doing, say, the nitty-gritty work of budget and more being out around Manitoba visiting various communities and various groups.</p>
<p>FP: Is perhaps that your greatest challenge, introducing yourself to Manitobans, getting them to know you?</p>
<p>Selinger: You know what? A lot of them know you already, but it's actually been enjoyable to have more direct contact with Manitobans and all the various communities I've visited. It's been quite positive. The bottom line is I will be out more interacting with various communities around things that we can do together.</p>
<p>FP: Some people within the opposition are still talking as though you will go to the people in 2010. Will you rule that out now?</p>
<p>Selinger: As I've said, we plan to serve out the mandate (until October 2011), I plan to serve out the mandate. There's lots of worthwhile things to do. There's lots of challenges. And that's my plan.</p>
<p>FP: In your throne speech you said you want to have an economic summit in the new year. Why?</p>
<p>Selinger: We did it 10 years ago. It just seemed time to do it again. It's just a good time to take a look at where we want to go in the future. There has been a very significant jolt to the global economy. It has impacts on all of us. We've always said we're not immune to that. We're starting to see some of the effects of that in terms of issues around Manitoba and different workplaces. We think it's a good time to take stock and refocus where we want to go in the future.</p>
<p>FP: At the same time you also want to create a premier's advisory council on poverty and education. Why?</p>
<p>Selinger: We do have an opportunity in Manitoba to improve the way we work together, to get educational outcomes, to address issues of social housing, to address a variety of issues, many of which we've taken initiatives on. But we've heard from people in the community that they'd like to have more opportunities to dialogue with the government on that and this is one way to do it. We'd like to get that up and running early in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
<p>FP: When are we going to be sitting in the new football stadium?</p>
<p>Selinger: As you know, the proponent for the new stadium asked for a year delay on that. The reality is that we will be having conversations with all the proponents and see what's possible to move that project forward.</p>
<p>FP: Is there a chance Mr. (David) Asper could have ownership of the Blue Bombers prior to a new football stadium being built?</p>
<p>Selinger: That hasn't been proposed by anybody at this stage of the game, that I'm aware of. But the reality is that I think we would want the idea of a new stadium to have some solid possibilities. As I understand it, the existing arrangement was that he has to build the new facility before he gets ownership of the team.</p>
<p>FP: The Queen is coming (in 2010). Are you looking forward to that?</p>
<p>Selinger: Absolutely. It's Manitoba's 140th birthday. It's a great honour to have the Queen here. It's a recognition of the province's role in Confederation. She's coming to three provinces. We're glad she's chosen us to be one of them.</p>
<p>FP: Have you met her before?</p>
<p>Selinger: Yes, when she was here last time (2002).</p>
<p>FP: One of the things you prided yourself on as finance minister is that you used to walk to work every day. Are you still walking to work?</p>
<p>Selinger: Not as frequently. I've been a little busy travelling around to various locations, so that routine has been broken by a necessity to be out and around more.</p>
<p>FP: Is there anything in your first 50 days as premier where you've asked yourself, 'What have I gotten myself into?'</p>
<p>Selinger: You know what? I think we knew we are in a global recession. This places challenges on governments. Governments have unique roles in recessions. They have greater demands for spending to solve a variety of issues and they have less revenue. That creates some unique challenges for a government. All governments are experiencing that right now. Our challenge is to keep the momentum going, to build and grow the economy, and at the same time address the essential service needs of Manitobans. That is a big challenge for every premier in the country right now as well as the prime minister.</p>
<p>FP: So you made the right decision?</p>
<p>Selinger: Absolutely. We all knew that there were going to be challenges. If the job was easy, why would you want to do it, quite frankly?</p>
<p>FP: What specific challenges do you see in the year ahead?</p>
<p>Selinger: We had a pandemic this fall and we'll see what the outcome of that is. So far, Manitoba has been able to respond in a pretty organized fashion in providing the (H1N1) vaccine to people, but there are always new surprises coming down the pipe. I think the economy will remain central, keeping the economy going and stimulated. There is a broad consensus among all the premiers and the prime minister that we have to continue the stimulus program well into early 2011, maybe all the way through 2011, depending what happens with the American economy. One thing that I think is good is that the country is working together on that. There's been good co-operation for the most part between the federal and provincial governments to make things happen to keep the economy buoyant.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>THE YEAR OF WAITING, AND WAITING AND WAITING; Do you get the feeling we spent most of 2009 fuming in long lines?</b>
</div><div>Katie Daubs   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>741 words</div><div>29 December 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Angrier than usual as 2009 draws to a close? Probably residual lineup rage.</p>
<p>In the past year, Torontonians have stood around waiting for H1N1 vaccines, faced garbage strike queues, lined up to buy condos, shuffled to buy TTC tokens and have been subjected to the daily traffic jam.</p>
<p>And in the last week of 2009, thousands waited up to eight hours at Pearson to board planes to the U.S., after an attempted terrorist attack led to more security screening.</p>
<p>Yes, this was a year spent in line.</p>
<p>"Queues have been with us ever since humans have had semi-organized society," said Richard Larson, the director of the Center for Engineering Systems Fundamentals at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>"I think in general the trend is for queues to go away."</p>
<p>Larson, who is also known as Dr. Queue, said such new technologies as ATMs and the Internet have caused lineups to die off a little.</p>
<p>But in Toronto, the line continues to thrive, enraging those who must submit to its unwieldy size to make it through the day. Myron Hlynka, a queuing theorist at the University of Windsor, said 2009 was probably worse than other years.</p>
<p>On Oct. 29, at the North York Civic Centre, thousands came with their children for H1N1 vaccinations. Many were turned away. Those who remained decried the Third World conditions in the line.</p>
<p>"Older people were waiting outside in the cold. I thought, something was wrong with this," Hlynka said.</p>
<p>So did many others.</p>
<p>Similar to the rage felt by a commuter who waits dutifully in the correct lane while a late merger zips up the right, queue rage is the indignation that arises when hospital board members and sports stars jump ahead for H1N1 vaccinations. Or it might be the anger felt by realtors who waited in a long line for days to buy a condo, only to be told they had waited in the wrong line. Queue rage is what happens in the absence of fair play: it elicits exaggerated sighs, rolled eyes and shouting matches.</p>
<p>"Doesn't that make people furious when you hear those athletes get (the vaccine)?" MIT's Larson said. "That's line jumping in policy, even if you can't see a physical line."</p>
<p>Although the H1N1 vaccine clinics soon had lineup systems in place, Larson said the original scene was reminiscent of Vladimir Sorokin's The Queue. In the 1983 fictional book, people waited in a three-day-long line in Moscow without knowing what they were waiting for.</p>
<p>Larson said people experience a common fear that if they don't join a line, whatever is at the end will be depleted.</p>
<p>The 24-hour news cycle, with updates about the status of lines, hasn't helped.</p>
<p>"When there's a perceived shortage, long lines become attractive," he said.</p>
<p>"It's a complete perversion."</p>
<p>Lines have been around since the dawn of time. The history of queue rage is more recent.</p>
<p>Did Cro-Magnon man weasel his way to the front of the food line by asking Cro-Magnon woman about the weather?</p>
<p>Did all those animals lining up for salvation on Noah's Ark wait patiently in pairs?</p>
<p>Larson said academics started studying the psychology of lines in the 1950s, when Disneyland opened in California. The company decided to leave out sidewalks during the first weeks so they could see where people walked before they paved.</p>
<p>That same decade, on the opposite coast of the country, people were complaining about long elevator delays in a high-rise apartment in New York City.</p>
<p>A man sent to study the problem suggested mirrors next to the elevators.</p>
<p>The complaints dropped to zero.</p>
<p>"People are distracted, they adjust their tie and makeup," Larson said.</p>
<p>The mirrors of the '50s have become the TV screens on TTC subway platforms and the trendy music at Canada's Wonderland. Other advancements have been made - the express and self-checkout lines at the grocery store try to make shopping more enjoyable.</p>
<p>No technology can ever fully eradicate rage, so Larson suggests people do something absurd, and try to make conversation.</p>
<p>"It depresses me when I see 14 people in line all face down checking stock prices," he said.</p>
<p>"The line is a lonely place."</p>

</p>
<p>What? Huh? December again, already? Time to take stock and sum up, you say? Well, somebody's got to do it, so I sat down with the tools of my trade.</p>
<p>While cutting the lime into wedges, I gave 2009 the mental once-over: Recession. Afghanistan. Swine flu. Bernie Madoff. The Michael Jackson industry. Iran. The climate change issue. Olympic marketing overkill. The coalition government fuss. The New York Yankees winning the World Series. Michael Ignatieff. Tiger Woody. Ugh.</p>
<p>2009 is surely the Year of the Vampire. The lifeless undead were ubiquitous this year, first in teen fiction, then in teen movies, teen TV and everywhere: True Blood, The Vampire Diaries, Twilight, etc., etc.</p>
<p>Why are we obsessed with vampires? Sociologists droned on about anxiety in the culture. Novelist Anne Rice calls vampirism "a powerful metaphor for the outcast and monster in all of us."</p>
<p>Vampires were not, however, the only absurd thing about 2009. Here are some of my other favourites:</p>
<p>- Those wacky Belgians: Belgium's national body-building championships were cancelled after government anti-doping inspectors showed up -- and all 20 competitors ran away. They should have expected some testing: Last year three-quarters of competitors tested positive for steroids and other bad stuff.</p>
<p>- Pickup line of the year: "I love you -- and I have a condom!" Yeah, that oughtta work. (It's the first line of a justly forgotten movie called The Uninvited.)</p>
<p>- Tweet of the year: Singer Lily Allen: "People say I'm egocentric. But enough about them."</p>
<p>- Toughest review of the year: Deborah Ross in The Spectator mag: "There really isn't a lot to say about Lesbian Vampire Killers apart from this: Don't go anywhere near it. Just don't see it. Do something else instead. Do anything else instead. Catch up with your ironing . . . at 87 minutes, it's probably a good 87 minutes too long."</p>
<p>- What will they call their kids?: Kelly Hildebrandt of Florida married Kelly Hildebrandt of Texas. The first one's middle name is Katrina; the second one's middle moniker is Carl. They met online, after she was searching for her own name on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. After making sure they aren't closely related, they started dating.</p>
<p>- What could possibly go wrong?: Solange Magnano, Miss Argentina of 1994, died from complications after buttock-enhancement therapy. She was 38.</p>
<p>- Wedding of the year: In Suvereto, near Livorno in Italy, a bride and groom had arranged for the bride's bouquet to be tossed to the bridesmaids and single female guests from a small plane. But the flowers somehow got sucked into the engine and the plane caught fire, exploded and plunged into a hostel, Corriere della Sera reported. One person was badly hurt.</p>
<p>- You can see she's got a future in politics: Paula Abdul, when asked about a report that Simon Cowell had asked her out on a date, answered this way: "There's some truth to that, and no truth to it."</p>
<p>- Teacher of the year: Crystal Defanti, a Grade 5 teacher near Sacramento, Calif., gave each of her students an end-of-year gift: A DVD she made herself, with footage of school events, outings, prize-givings -- and her on a sofa, naked and intimate with a boyfriend.</p>
<p>It was an accident, she said, apologizing. This being California, the school board didn't fire her.</p>
<p>- "Men are pigs" dept.: Mel Gibson, Jon Gosselin, David Letterman, Ronnie Wood, Gordon Ramsay, John Edwards, Mark Sanford, Eddie Cibrian and, of course, Tiger Woods.</p>
<p>My favourite is Sanford, governor of South Carolina, who was supposedly "hiking the Appalachian trail" when, in fact, he was in South America with a mistress. All over South Carolina, guys in bars started getting slapped in the face just for inviting girls to go hiking.</p>
<p>- This never happens to Horatio Caine: When German cops found the same female DNA at 39 different crime scenes, over two years, they were sure they had a serial killer who also dabbled in other types of crime. But it turned out that all 39 samples matched the factory worker who had made the cotton swabs cops use to collect samples at crime scenes.</p>

</div><div>National Post</div>

<p>Parliament Hill is understandably prone to partisan extremes, but 2009 has been a particularly bilious year. Liberal party members will blame the atmosphere of chronic hostility on the Conservatives and the aggressiveness of their tactics in bringing the never-ending election campaign to Canada, complete with negative ads and the targeted denigration of opponents.</p>
<p>Conservatives can respond by citing the Liberals' continuing refusal to accept the validity of their rejection by voters, and their relentless efforts to demonize Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his government. What, after all, was the coalition crisis last winter but an attempt to undo the election of 2008 and install as prime minister a Liberal leader who had been overwhelmingly rejected by voters just weeks before?</p>
<p>Whichever side you prefer, there's no denying that whatever accomplishments the government can claim have been overshadowed by the bitterness and venom that characterized the year.</p>
<p>Just a quick run through the past 12 months' events offers a taste of how rancid federal politics have become. The coalition crisis was quickly followed by the economic crisis, during which the opposition mounted a furious effort to convince Canadians, against all evidence and common sense, that Mr. Harper's government was somehow to blame for a downturn that was sweeping the globe (and which Canada, in fact, weathered far better than most).</p>
<p>That was followed by efforts to somehow link the government to the unappetizing spectacle of former prime minister Brian Mulroney defending himself against the ever-changing accusations of the diminutive German arms merchant Karlheinz Schreiber; which was followed in turn by Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff insisting the government had betrayed the unemployed by failing to enrichen the employment insurance program, even though the Liberals had considered it perfectly satisfactory when they were running the show.</p>
<p>We were treated to two efforts to force the resignation of Natural Resources Minister Lisa Raitt (once over some private remarks she'd made to a press aide and once over fundraising activities in a previous job); accusations the Prime Minister had surreptitiously slipped a Communion wafer into his pocket; claims that the Tories had secretly manipulated Olympicwear designers into using a C (for Canada) that looked like the C (for Conservatives) on party literature; efforts to blame the government for a shortage of H1N1 vaccine that was being felt world-wide; allegations the Tories were trying to link Liberal MPs to anti-Semitism; and the year-ending hysteria over the Copenhagen climate change conference, which saw Canada, which produces less than 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, portrayed by overheated activists as an international pariah even though it has more aggressive reduction targets than China (which produces 21%) or the U.S. (which produces 20%).</p>
<p>No wonder the Conservatives habitually react to critics with a mix of derision and contempt, which nonetheless does nothing to improve the atmosphere. Defence Minister Peter MacKay only managed to inflame a debate over Canada's treatment of Afghan detainees when he chose to belittle whistleblower Richard Colvin rather than address his allegations. Over their four years in power the Conservatives have grown increasingly fond of secrecy and obfuscation, boycotting committees they don't like when they aren't stuffing the Senate with partisan supporters.</p>
<p>Minority governments carry with them the constant possibility of an election, though the danger this year looks to be less than in the recent past. Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff is looking to recuperate from self-inflicted wounds, and needs time. Mr. Harper is in a position of relative strength in the polls, which should provide a measure of comfort. Both men would do Canada a service if they would disavow the cheap tactics and low blows of the past 12 months. The government needs to get over its love of secrecy and distrust of anyone and anything that doesn't come with a Conservative party membership card; the opposition has to abandon the cheap, scandal-a-day approach to challenging the government.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hospital battling superbug; VRE outbreak; Lakeshore limiting visits to patients</b>
</div><div>CHARLIE FIDELMAN   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>485 words</div><div>28 December 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Lakeshore General Hospital posted a guard on its fourth floor west wing to limit visits to patients because of an outbreak of hospital-borne bacterial infections that are resistant to antibiotics.</p>
<p>But while patients and relatives complained of an outbreak of C. difficile (Clostridium difficile) illnesses, which causes abdominal cramping and diarrhea, Lakeshore hospital officials said they are actually fighting an outbreak of another superbug, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, known as VRE.</p>
<p>Commonly found in people's intestines, Enterococci does not usually cause illness in the healthy, but can cause urinary and wound infections in those with a weakened immune system.</p>
<p>"I was going to go visit today, but changed my mind because I don't want to bring anything home. I'm concerned about the rest of my family," said Rod Demarais, who regularly visits a friend on the fourth-floor medical wing.</p>
<p>Ten days ago, hospital staff moved patients onto gurneys in the hallways while walls were washed and rooms were disinfected, and then they moved patients back into their beds, said a patient, who asked that his name not be published because he feared reprisals from the nurses.</p>
<p>Hospital spokesperson Marie Josée Labrosse confirmed the hospital is dealing with an outbreak of VRE in eight patients.</p>
<p>"What we do is close the floor, clean as much as we can, and isolate the patients," she said. "We have some cases (of C. diff) but no outbreak.</p>
<p>Visitors are allowed into patients' rooms one at a time if they wash their hands thoroughly and wear a surgical gown and gloves.</p>
<p>Since 2003-2004, when a hyper-virulent strain of C.diff in Quebec killed hundreds of patients, hospitals are required to report outbreaks or clusters of C.diff cases to public health authorities.</p>
<p>According to the latest public health data available only as of the end of November, two Montreal hospitals are reporting outbreaks of</p>
<p>C. difficile, said Terry-Nan Tannenbaum of the Montreal Health and Social Services Agency's department of public health.</p>
<p>Maisonneuve Rosemont and St. Luc hospitals reported 14 cases of C. difficile. There have been no deaths.</p>
<p>"This is the time of year when C. diff occurs," Tannenbaum said. "But hospitals are aware of what they have to do - basic control measures that have to do with cleaning and rapidly isolating symptomatic people."</p>
<p>At least 13 people died at Charles LeMoyne Hospital in the Montérégie region as of August in connection with an outbreak that sickened 43 patients.</p>
<p>"We can't say it's over. As of Friday, we had 15 cases," said hospital spokesperson Annie Laroche, but no new deaths.</p>
<p>Quebec health officials had reported a small drop in hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile illnesses in November because of extra hygiene measures adopted because of the threat of the H1N1 virus.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canadian politics pretty dull in 2009</b>
</div><div>Rob Roach   </div>
<div>Special to the Sun</div>
<div>743 words</div><div>28 December 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>I have been asking my fellow policy wonks what stands out for them in Canadian politics in 2009 and the answer seems to be "not much." Despite this, it is worth putting together a list that helps sum up the year. Here goes:</p>
<p>1. The election that wasn't: Remember when Ignatieff told Harper that his "time was up" and promised to bring down the government at the first available opportunity? Yeah, that didn't happen.</p>
<p>2. Canada gets a black eye in Copenhagen: There was so much spin coming out of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen that it was hard to tell what was going on let alone what it will mean in the years ahead. In an unusual twist, Canada was cast against type as a villain. It's unclear what this achieved other than making students think twice about sewing Canadian flags onto their backpacks before travelling in Europe. On the domestic front, the real work is yet to take place as the provinces and federal government need to design and implement a workable national plan that does not hamstring the economy.</p>
<p>3. Alberta runs a deficit: It turns out that money does not grow on trees in Alberta as the province endured its first deficit in 15 years. The final amount will likely be smaller than the $7 billion figure forecast back in June, but it is still a dramatic shift from the multi-billion dollar surpluses of previous years. Boom and bust--that's life in Alberta.</p>
<p>4. Cool sporting event that takes place in British Columbia between 2009 and 2011: It's not clear if I am allowed to use the word Olympic without a license, but I will risk it. While Canadians were stocking up on Olympic mittens and commemorative glasses, tension was brewing in Vancouver over attempts by the organizers to control guerrilla marketing and what others see as a totalitarian-esque crackdown on free speech.</p>
<p>5. The feds start selling cars: It was back in December 2008 that the federal government and the province of Ontario announced loans to GM and Chrysler totaling about $4 billion. Fast forward to summer 2009 and the bailout figure was over $10 billion and the federal government owned an 11.7 per cent stake in GM.</p>
<p>6. Even more unelected Senators: Stephen Harper is the only Prime Minister that has taken Senate reform seriously and we need to wait and see if he can manoeuvre this file through the sludge that is Canadian politics. After appointing 18 unelected Senators at the end of 2008, Harper appointed nine more in August 2009 including former Tory campaign chair Doug Finley. Democracy and the Red Chamber will remain distant strangers for some time to come.</p>
<p>7. Canada stays in the inner circle of richest countries: Some wonks were wondering when Canada would get the tap on the shoulder and be asked to make room in the G8 for China or some other country. This was avoided when the G8's role as "the pre-eminent council on global economic cooperation" was taken over by the G20 in the fall.</p>
<p>8. Swine flu: Known for a while by the unseemly moniker swine flu, H1N1 brought tragedy to many individuals and families in Canada and around the world who lost loved ones to the virus. At the same time, the federal government and the provinces launched a mass immunization program. It is difficult to assess the success of the program at this time, but its ups and down should provide lots of fodder for improving how we respond to future challenges of this sort.</p>
<p>9. The Great Recession: The claim that capitalism was dead was refuted in 2009. Yes, the domestic and global economy limped along and many people were hit hard, but the economy lives to grow another day.</p>
<p>10. The War in Afghanistan: Last, but not least, and whether you think Canada should be in Afghanistan or not, our soldiers continue to put their lives on the line in the service of Canada and for that they deserve our deepest thanks. The war dragged on this year and will likely do so in 2010 as well. Let's all pray for peace and the safe return of our service men and women.</p>

</p>
<p>Calgary-based senior economist at <span class="companylink">ATB Financial</span></p>
<p>All Canadian drivers know the terror of skidding on black ice. It's one of those great national unifiers, like hockey and Tim's double-doubles.</p>
<p>If we're lucky enough to avoid a crash, we breathe an enormous sigh of relief, but we don't return to driving as normal. We shut the radio off. Talking and laughing cease. We slow down, squeeze the wheel and drive with exaggerated focus. It's instant sobriety.</p>
<p>There is a resonance as we look forward to the decade starting in 2010.</p>
<p>Recent decades can be loosely defined by a word or a phrase. Social upheaval in the 1960s. Flash and entitlement in the 1980s. Rage and disillusionment in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The 2000s? Fear.</p>
<p>From the first few minutes, when we panicked about lights shutting off and planes dropping out of the sky, fear defined the 2000s. Y2K proved to be a non-event, but it set the stage for a decade of terrifying events.</p>
<p>Consider the big news stories of the past 120 months: Collapsing tech stocks. Planes slamming into the World Trade Center. Bombings in Bali, Madrid and London. Anthrax. The Beltway sniper. The Indian Ocean tsunami. Eerie videotapes of a bearded man named bin Laden. Hurricane Katrina. SARS. Drowning polar bears. The near collapse of the global financial market. H1N1.</p>
<p>Even when economic times were good, there was fear. In the United States, people feared missing out on the housing market and piled crazily in to whatever real estate they could. China's rise as an economic powerhouse has been, on balance, tremendously beneficial for the global economy. But this has stirred irrational fears of the Chinese taking over the world. (The host's medal count at the Beijing Olympics may have been a harbinger of things to come!)</p>
<p>Fortunately, fear has a way of clearing and sharpening the mind. A near-collision on black ice brings an adrenalin rush that heightens our senses and refocuses our attention. And, at its best, fear is an essential survival instinct as it helps us avoid legitimate dangers in the future.</p>
<p>If fear marked the 2000s, maybe a post-panic sobriety will mark the next 10 years. Focus, caution and greatly lowered expectations might be what we look back on in December, 2019.</p>
<p>While a decade of caution and lower expectations may not sound like much fun, we're due for one – particularly around public finance. Government debt levels around the world have ballooned nearly out of control, and credit-rating agencies are fearful (there's that word again) that some governments may be rendered insolvent in the coming years. While small countries such as Iceland and Greece have already been smacked down pretty hard, even the giant U.S. and British governments have had their fiscal knuckles rapped. Japan is hanging by a thread.</p>
<p>A decade of sobriety and lower expectations will begin with a realization that governments cannot keep stimulating forever. Through higher taxes, lower spending or a combination of both, public spending must be brought under control. None of this will be welcome news to voters, but we will have no choice.</p>
<p>On the bright side, we can hope that the decade of fear has handed us a few lessons – lessons about excess, entitlement and greed. During the two most fearful events of the decade, 9/11 and the market meltdown of 2008, we learned that we actually don't know very much at all. We were shaken and humbled. Like a hard slap in the face, we were taught that our governments, our economies and our environment are much more fragile than we thought.</p>
<p>However, being handed a lesson and learning a lesson are different things. Will the coming decade bring about the sobriety we need? Or will our memories be short? If excess, entitlement and greed are not curbed, the world can anticipate more horror in the decade starting in 2010. And if we do not accept that government deficits and debt must be controlled, we will only prolong a much worse fate later on.</p>
<p>We say goodbye to the decade of fear, but we won't miss it. When we ring in the new year, we will remember to tread lightly. The economic and political road signs are still warning us: Caution! Icy Conditions Ahead.</p>
<p>The opinions are Todd Hirsch's own.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sask. response to H1N1 a team effort: McKinnon</b>
</div><div>Pamela Cowan   </div>
<div>Saskatchewan News Network; Regina Leader-Post</div>
<div>961 words</div><div>28 December 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>An aboriginal map hangs opposite Dr. Moira McKin non's desk -- a reminder of the native land of Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer.</p>
<p>"It reminds me of home; it reminds me of the importance of country and communication," McKinnon said of the painting from the desert in the north part of Western Australia. "It just grounds me."</p>
<p>Preparing for the global influenza pandemic, McKinnon had to be grounded as she mapped out the province's H1N1 strategy -- a plan that became the envy of many other Canadian jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Some clinics, such as those in Alberta, opened their doors to the general public when the H1N1 vaccine was available, but the vaccine supply either ran out or people waited in line for hours to roll up their sleeves.</p>
<p>"There's a feeling so strong in Canada of equity, but in that case, equity went by-the-by because it was the strongest and the fittest who got the vaccine, really," McKinnon said. "Equity is sometimes making decisions about prioritization -- so you can get those who are most vulnerable vaccinated first."</p>
<p>From the beginning, Saskatchewan kept to the nationally agreed-to sequencing protocol, which identified priority groups -- the first being health-care workers, followed by high-risk individuals with underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>McKinnon pointed out the province's pandemic response was a team effort involving many medical and non-medical staff who organized and delivered more than 500,000 doses of H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>"There was something like 20 or 30 people involved day-to-day on the H1N1 -- it was quite an event, really," McKinnon said. "It went across ministries as well. There was a lot of inter-ministerial departmental meetings with Corrections and Justice and Education. It was really a cross-disciplinary response to the pandemic. I was just the one that was in front of the cameras."</p>
<p>Her calm demeanor at numerous news conferences was accompanied by her soft-spoken, but clear, updates about the virus activity in the province. Her wealth of public health experience was evident.</p>
<p>Not only has McKinnon worked in western Australia, but also in the United Kingdom, Russia and China.</p>
<p>As the key advisor for communicable diseases and emergencies for Australia's federal government, she dealt with many crises including the 2002 Bali bombings, anthrax, avian influenza and the 2004 Asian tsunami. Those experiences taught her that before a public health decision can be made, it's important to gather all of the evidence and information.</p>
<p>"It's never enough -- but you have to make a decision," she said. "It's very important to keep calm and assess all of that information and make the best decision on the information that you've got."</p>
<p>The voice of the community helped health officials decide who should be immunized first.</p>
<p>"In Saskatchewan, it came back to us in many forms -- through HealthLine, through direct e-mails and phone calls," McKinnon said. "Saskatchewan wanted the children immunized, and that came from the seniors as well. It's important to respect and understand that community voice on top of all the information. It's a big part of the decision-making."</p>
<p>While the H1N1 virus was milder than expected, it could have had a huge effect, she said.</p>
<p>"It was a very valuable event to go through because we're going to have another one like it," McKinnon said. "There's no doubt."</p>
<p>Infectious disease threats are inevitable because of increasing world travel and the close interaction between the planet's nine billion people and two billion animals.</p>
<p>Most of the viruses from which humans get clinical diseases come from animals. "That interface continues with pets at home and farming, and the increasing need for animals for food," McKinnon said.</p>
<p>While the pandemic grabbed headlines around the world, work continued on the province's HIV strategy.</p>
<p>"We have the highest incidence rate of HIV -- in fact, it's twice the national average -- and the biggest increase is in young aboriginal women, so that's the next thing that we need to look at now," McKinnon said. "The things that are driving this HIV epidemic in Saskatchewan are the same things that will make it occur anywhere else in Canada, so we need to get a national approach; the strategy won't work unless all the parties are part of it, including the community."</p>
<p>She believes the lessons of collaboration learned during the H1N1 outbreak can be used to address the HIV crisis.</p>
<p>"The other thing I learned from H1N1 is the public want to listen and be part of the decision making," she said. "They do care."</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the new year, McKinnon rates environmental concerns high on the agenda as more industry is poised to come to Saskatchewan. Also on her radar are the growing problems of diabetes, obesity and Saskatchewan's high injury rate.</p>
<p>She's pleased with the smoking legislation that was proclaimed while H1N1 was prominent. The next challenge, she said, is ensuring it's enforced.</p>
<p>Despite 2009's many challenges, the year is ending on a high note for McKinnon.</p>
<p>"Saskatchewan has got such a history with the introduction of medicare, which Australia now has. So many good things have come out of Saskatchewan and I'm very impressed by the people here and the spirit of collaboration -- it's a pleasure to work here and a pleasure to be here," she said. "I think Saskatchewan can lead in health and has led in health. I'm pleased to be part of the team."</p>

</p>
<p>On April 26, Canada announced its first cases of swine flu -- two in B.C., and four in Nova Scotia among private school students home from a school trip to the Yucatan Peninsula. The U.S. declared a health emergency after confirming a total of 20 swine flu cases in the country. In Mexico, more than 1,000 people were placed under observation, and Mexico City went into virtual lockdown, shutting schools, museums and theatres.</p>
<p>In Canada, the government issued a travel advisory for Mexico. School trips were cancelled. Catholic priests in Edmonton told worshippers to stop shaking hands in peace and just nod their heads instead. The Funeral Service Association of Canada issued an updated pandemic planning guide that suggested funeral homes set aside a six-month supply of gloves, masks, face shields, gowns, embalming chemicals, body bags "or other impervious shrouds," and to prepare for a possible increased demand for cremation caskets and "economically-priced caskets, especially since there may be multiple deaths in a single family." Funeral directors were advised that, while there were no conclusive studies on the flu's survival rate in a dead body, "it is a best practice to assume infection up to 48 hours after death." Masking or covering the mouths and noses of the deceased was suggested.</p>
<p>Canadian intensive-care doctors and researchers, working with colleagues in Mexico, moved quickly to collect, analyze and disseminate data on the sickest patients, because doctors were being forced to go on precious little. Who was it attacking? Who was getting sick? What therapies seemed to work? What were the danger signals that someone was getting very sick and needed aggressive treatment?</p>
<p>All the evidence for treating influenza had been on "walking, talking" patients with typical flu -- "the old influenza we used to talk about, the kind that makes you sick for a few days, and you get better," says Dr. Anand Kumar, an intensivist with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority and associate professor of critical care and infectious disease at the University of Manitoba. There was virtually no evidence on critically ill patients.</p>
<p>Soon, Kumar and other critical care physicians were coming up against the limits of "evidence-based" medicine, which dictates doing what the best evidence says works. But the Canadians were discovering some key assumptions were wrong.</p>
<p>"The national guidelines said that certain tests for this condition are 100 per cent sensitive. If it's negative, it's negative. If it's positive, it's positive," Kumar says. Except doctors were seeing cases that were coming up negative on testing that, clinically, were screaming they were real cases.</p>
<p>"There was a lot of confusion. Do you treat them? Do you not treat them? Those of us in the ICU said, `We're just going to treat them."' The guidelines also said to treat for five days with antivirals. "But we're looking at these guys and they're still sick after five days. We think we need to treat longer. A lot of us said, `To heck with that, we're going to treat for 10 days, because that seems more reasonable.'</p>
<p>"Now that we've had a chance to actually study it, it turns out we were right."</p>
<p>Research by Kumar and other members of the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group, a 200-plus-member group of critical care researchers working to improve the care and outcomes of critically sick children and adults, was shared with countries worldwide.</p>
<p>"I've seen the written recommendations, like the English recommendations, for the management of severe H1N1 disease," Kumar says. "They are virtually verbatim what we told them."</p>
<p>Back in Ottawa, Earl Brown, virologist and director of the University of Ottawa's Emerging Pathogens Research Centre, was anxious to study this new viral threat as well. But Health Canada initially declared H1N1 a Level 3 pathogen -- an infectious agent transmitted by an airborne route that can cause serious or life-threatening disease. The plague is a Level 3 pathogen. So are SARS and yellow fever.</p>
<p>Around the same time, federal legislation was passed that made it illegal to research substances of this type, unless in a certified, biosafety Level 3 facility, labs that are in short supply in Canada.</p>
<p>"We couldn't work on it, because our new Level 3 facility wasn't yet certified, and hardly any labs could work on it, because they were saying this is a real scary virus, it's containment Level 3," Brown says.</p>
<p>"We were sitting on our hands, and most other people were too, and everybody was getting nervous, there was all this hype about it."</p>
<p>What Brown found most bizarre was that, at that time, many schools in Ottawa had decided not to notify parents if a case of swine flu was identified, because the level of risk of severe disease in infected schoolchildren wasn't considered severe enough to warrant notifying parents.</p>
<p>Brown said the pathogen should not have been deemed level 3. He remembers sitting in federal advisory committee meetings, thinking, "They don't trust scientists enough to work on this thing, but it's not important enough to notify the parents of children when schools have the infection? It was getting a little bit Kafkaesque."</p>
<p>But as the spring wave slowed, and H1N1 activity died down, so too did public sense of urgency and seriousness. The virus wasn't cutting a swath across Asia and South America. Horror fantasies about the flu are always about the possibility of a repeat of Spanish flu, of horse-drawn carriages carrying corpses, but people weren't dropping dead in the streets. When Canada announced it was buying an adjuvanted vaccine, some feared the vaccine more than the virus itself. An adjuvant is a chemical added to the vaccine to boost the body's immune response.</p>
<p>"You had the steady drumbeat of instant experts who were saying how the adjuvant is going to kill way more people than the disease," says Dr. Brian Ward, an infectious-disease physician and associate director of the Research Institute at McGill University Health Centre.</p>
<p>Then Evan Frustaglio died on the very day the H1N1 flu shot clinics opened, and everything changed. "All of a sudden, everybody wanted it," Brown, of the University of Ottawa, says. "You had people swarming the ERs, and the second wave was on."</p>
<p>Frustrations grew as the vaccine was released in fits and starts. Clinics opened to chaos before organizers learned to handle the crowds. In the early days, many clinics had hundreds of people standing in line for hours, often outdoors, and often learning after a four- or five-hour wait that the day's supply of vaccine had run out. Parents had to take care of preschoolers for hours without leaving their spots in line. Some outdoor lines had no washrooms nearby. Many had nowhere to get food or drink.</p>
<p>There were complaints of vaccines being delivered to clinics after office hours, of not enough syringes or alcohol swabs, and the logistics of recruiting the sheer numbers of nurses and doctors needed to give the injections.</p>
<p>The flu made it impossible to do some other public health work.</p>
<p>Restaurant and water inspections couldn't stop. "But the primary (non-flu) immunizations for young kids, the first series had to keep going, but the booster shots for 18-months and four-year-olds, some of those were delayed," says Dr. Cory Neudorf, chair of the Canadian Public Health Association and chief medical health officer with the Saskatoon Health Region.</p>
<p>Many of the screening programs used to pick up problems, such as failure to thrive, vision or hearing problems, had to be delayed. "It basically touched every part of public health."</p>
<p>"There will be certain new moms who aren't visited, babies who may end up never getting that screening appointment, immunization rates even. We've seen in past crises like this there's a cohort of kids that just never catch up," he says. "That's nagging a bit."</p>
<p>Experts say it's too early for H1N1's post-mortem, that a third wave of infection could hit in 2010. We're only now entering what is normally the height of flu season. The worst-case scenario? A complete re-assortment of the virus, where H1N1 swaps genes with another flu virus and a more lethal pandemic emerges.</p>
<p>Ward, of McGill, says that, in retrospect, officials overestimated the impact of H1N1.</p>
<p>But "they would have been crazy not to have reacted the way they did. They would have been crazy, because there was no way that you can predict what's going to happen. In public health, people are always going to get slammed after the fact. If it turns out to be worse than you said, you're going to get yelled at. And if turns out to be better than you said, people are going to say 'Didn't you overreact?' "</p>
<p>The news coming out of Mexico was that this was a bad and different bug, that it killed nearly half of those who became critically sick. The genetics of the microbe had everybody frightened, Ward says, because it was a virus like no one had seen before. In May, the experts were still arguing about whether or not older people were actually protected against infection, or whether the ones that weren't getting sick just hadn't visited Mexico.</p>
<p>What's clear is that no computer simulation could have given the country, or the world, as much information as we now have about how to respond to a public health emergency.</p>
<p>"We've basically had our bluff called," Ward says. "Nature came along and said, 'OK, you say you're ready, are you?' In many instances we were, and in some instances we weren't. This simulation has brought us a huge distance toward being able to respond far more competently."</p>
<p>Where public health officials fell hardest, he and others say, was in communicating risks. The deaths of 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio and 10-year-old Vanetia Warner within days of one another shook a nation.</p>
<p>"If those poor children hadn't died, I think we would be looking at a 15 per cent vaccine uptake," Ward says. "Those deaths galvanized a lot of people. But we should not have to rely on that kind of serendipity to be able to communicate these kinds of risks."</p>
<p>In Toronto, in the intensive care unit at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, critical care physician Dr. Robert Fowler has treated patients so ill with H1N1 that not even turning them on their stomachs to ventilate improves oxygen flow, and often the only option is to insert tubes into large arteries, and circulate their blood through a machine that adds oxygen, bypassing the lungs completely.</p>
<p>H1N1 has consumed Fowler and his colleagues for months.</p>
<p>"It's the kind of thing you don't go through very often, especially in the early stages of this, when you're not sure where this is going to go. You kind of say to yourself, 'This is a pandemic, people are getting sick and dying because of it.' This is sort of what you do for a living" -- trying to keep people alive, he says, when their bodies are trying to die.</p>
<p>Keeping a patient with severe H1N1 disease on a ventilator for months is a substantial response to try to save one life.</p>
<p>"But these people are generally young, and otherwise healthy. And if they can be brought through this eventually, well, they'll go back to being themselves."</p>

<p>Who knew there was room for anger in the kingdom of Internet fads ruled by LOLCats?</p>
<p>"FML," a digital slang used to express frustration, ranked second among <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s top 15 words and phrases used in American status updates in 2009.</p>
<p>The acronym, which stands for "f-- my life," came blazing onto the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> lexicon scene, moving from a relatively low usage rate to one of the most mainstream status updates in 2009, according to the social networking site's data team.</p>
<p>The month of May -- a time when many students are wrapping up their final exams and hunting for summer jobs -- saw the biggest spike in statuses containing the acronym. After a relative lull in usage during the summer, FML crept back toward chart-topping levels throughout the first semester of a new school year.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s data team also noticed a weekly trend in the number of frustrated status updates. "As we'd expect ... Mondays and Tuesdays are particularly rough," the data team said in a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> note. "Surprisingly, it is not Mondays that rate highest, but Tuesdays."</p>
<p>In order to make the list more comprehensive, the data team used keywords to group similar items.</p>
<p>Keywords "Michael Jackson," "Patrick Swayze" and "Billy Mays" were used to map the frequency for status updates mentioning celebrity deaths (fourth place); movie titles, such as New Moon, Transformers and The Hangover were used to track discussion of movies (sixth place); "Easter, "Lord" and "God" were used to track the prevalence of religion in <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> statuses (14th place).</p>
<p>Twitter, the micro-blogging site, came in a respectable 10th place, even though activity peaked in April and has been decreasing steadily ever since.</p>
<p>Twitter also released a list of most-tweeted topics of the year. Its list was broken down into categories of news events, people, movies, TV shows, technology, sports and hashtags. While Harry Potter, the Super Bowl and American Idol each topped one of the top 10 lists, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>RAPTORS ON ROLL</p>
<p>Chris Bosh had 25 points and 16 rebounds, Jarrett Jack scored 17 points and the Toronto Raptors extended their winning streak to a season-high four games, beating the Detroit Pistons 102-95 Sunday in Toronto. Even with Richard Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince and Ben Gordon all back in the lineup, the Pistons couldn't stop their losing streak from reaching seven games. Detroit has not topped 100 points in any of those defeats. Hamilton and Gordon each scored 15 and Jonas Jerebko and Rodney Stuckey both had 14 for the Pistons. Ben Wallace had 10 points and nine rebounds.</p>
<p>HOLIDAY CLASSIC</p>
<p>The OUA champion Windsor Lancers host two CIS women's basketball teams in the four-day Holiday Classic today through Thursday at the St. Denis Centre. Today, the No. 2 nationally ranked Lancers (8-0) face Toronto (4-4), currently sixth in the OUA East conference, at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>BOWL HISTORY</p>
<p>Sarah Thomas made history at the Pizza Bowl Saturday, becoming the first woman to officiate a bowl game when she worked the matchup between Ohio and Marshall at Ford Field. Thomas is one of five women officiating in major college football, but Pizza Bowl spokesman Tim Moore said she was the first to draw an assignment for a Bowl Subdivision post-season game. "It was an honour," Thomas said after Marshall's 21-17 win.</p>
<p>CHANGE OF HEART</p>
<p>Florida coach Urban Meyer is taking an indefinite leave of absence instead of resigning and expects to be on the sideline leading the Gators when next season opens.</p>
<p>"I do in my gut believe that will happen," Meyer said Sunday at a Sugar Bowl news conference. Offensive co-ordinator Steve Addazio will run the team during Meyer's absence, but Meyer will be the coach against No. 4 Cincinnati New Year's Day.</p>
<p>SPARTANS TO FACE POTTS</p>
<p>Texas Tech coach Mike Leach announc-ed junior quarterback Taylor Potts will start over junior Steven Sheffield against Michigan State in the Jan. 2 Alamo Bowl. Potts started nine games for the 8-4 Red Raiders this season. Michigan State is making a third consecutive bowl appearance for the first time since 1995-97, and it is the second-longest post-season streak in school history.</p>
<p>ROONEY REBOUNDS</p>
<p>Wayne Rooney went from villain to hero as Manchester United won 3-1 at Hull Sunday to move within just two points of Premier League leaders Chelsea. Rooney put United in front with his sixth goal in as many games on the stroke of half time but his poor back pass to goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak led to Craig Fagan's penalty equalizer. The England striker ensured his mistake did not prove costly by going on to set up the champions' two other goals.</p>
<p>LAST-DITCH EFFORT</p>
<p>Promoter Bob Arum delivered what he said would be his last proposal Sunday to salvage the fight between Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr., which has been on life support over a blood testing dispute. Under Arum's proposal, the Nevada Athletic Commission would have the final say in how much testing there would be for the fight and when it would take place.</p>
<p>ESCOBAR CLOSE TO DEAL</p>
<p>A person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press that injury-plagued pitcher Kelvim Escobar and the New York Mets have reached a preliminary agreement on a US$1.25-million, one-year-contract.</p>

</p>
<p>1 H1N1: Bitten by the bug</p>
<p>Victoria's Michelle Bossi was front-page news in April: Vancouver Island's first confirmed case of the H1N1 flu, which she contracted on vacation in Mexico, where the pandemic broke out this spring.</p>
<p>The global panic (or prudence, depending on your perspective) spread faster than the flu itself. Metchosin's Hans Helgesen Elementary closed for a week in May after students became sick (they tested negative). A woman was asked to leave a Victoria Transit bus because other passengers feared her coughing. We learned to sneeze in our elbows, eschew the handshake, pump hand sanitizer like Texas crude.</p>
<p>In mid-September, a woman from the Beecher Bay reserve became the first of 10 people on Vancouver Island to die of the disease.</p>
<p>By October, it was a race to see which you would get first, the flu or the flu shot, which became 2009's Tickle Me Elmo, the must-have gift in short supply. Victorians waited patiently in three-hour queues reminiscent of Soviet bread lines (or Boxing Day at Future Shop) as the scarce vaccine was meted out to the most vulnerable (and the Calgary Flames).</p>
<p>The pandemic wasn't as bad as we feared; by mid-December it had killed 51 British Columbians (the seasonal flu typically kills 400 to 800) and about 10,000 worldwide. That raises the question: Have we overreacted to H1N1, or has all that elbow-sneezing and vaccinating prevented it from being worse?</p>
<p>2 MICHAEL JACKSON DIED</p>
<p>Judging from the response, the overdose death of the 50-year-old King of Pop was the worst thing to happen in the world ever, even though there's a strong suspicion that Wacko Jacko was what would normally be called a child-molesting pervert. Apparently his celebrity/talent upgraded his status to "troubled genius," which is what we call famous people when we want to make excuses for them.</p>
<p>Not since Princess Diana had we seen this kind of global grief, or at least ghoulish fascination. <span class="companylink">Yahoo.com</span> reported "Michael Jackson" was the top search term of 2009 (followed by "Twilight"). His name appeared in the Times Colonist more than 100 times in 2009. A flash mob danced Thriller in Centennial Square.</p>
<p>Jackson's death celebutrumped that of Farrah Fawcett, who died of cancer the same day, much to the sadness of anyone (not that I'm naming names here) who had her swimsuit poster pinned to the wall in 1977.</p>
<p>Both deaths came within days of that of John Houghtaling, inventor of the Magic Fingers coin-operated vibrating bed. The world was shaken.</p>
<p>3 THIS WASN'T IN THE BROCHURE</p>
<p>Jeez, I must be blind. I'm looking through the provincial Liberals' election platform and try as I might I can't find anything about the HST, or axing public servants, or cutting health care, or throwing non-profit groups under the bus. What I can find is Gordon Campbell drawing a line in the sand and insisting that the budget deficit won't be higher than the $495 million announced in February.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, just two months after winning another majority in May, the Liberals thank the voters by -- surprise! -- announcing the 12 per cent HST, which will take effect July 1, 2010, adding to the cost of a whole range of goods that are currently free of provincial sales tax.</p>
<p>And, oh, that cast-in-stone budget deficit? It's suddenly $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>If there's good news for the Liberals, it's that the next election isn't until May 2013 and voters have the collective memory of a fruit fly.</p>
<p>4 GUNS AND DRUGS</p>
<p>A series of high-profile murder trials and major drug busts signalled that we're going to have to dig a deeper moat if we want to isolate ourselves from the bloody narco-wars on the Lower Mainland.</p>
<p>Drug dealer Daniel Aitken was actually convicted of two separate murders; he shot his friend Alex McLean in Esquimalt in 2003 and Adan Merino in Victoria in 2004. Both McLean and Merino were involved in the drug world. Aitken had earlier done time for killing yet another Victoria dealer, Samir Shamoon, in 1995.</p>
<p>A teenager tied to the Red Scorpions, a gang trying to make inroads on Vancouver Island, was convicted of killing UVic student Philbert Truong, whose only crime was to try to save a friend after a minor dispute outside the Red Jacket nightclub in 2008.</p>
<p>Late in the year, former Highlands councillor Ken Brotherston and his two sons went on trial for the slaying of Keith Taylor at a West Shore house frequented by crack addicts.</p>
<p>In September, eight people are arrested in the region's biggest-ever drug bust. Close to 100 cops raid five locations in Saanich, Colwood and Langford, netting $2.25 million in cocaine, $420,600 in cash and four high-powered handguns. Also in September, Victoria-based RCMP revealed that a two-year investigation had resulted in charges against 11 people and the seizure of millions of dollars worth of cocaine, ecstasy, GHB and crystal meth.</p>
<p>Yes, this is last year's story, but the effects were felt in 2009.</p>
<p>5 THE MELTDOWN</p>
<p>Victoria's unemployment rate doubled to seven per cent. The implosion of the Traveller's Inn chain was the most visible sign of trouble in the hospitality industry in this, the year of the staycation.</p>
<p>The half-built Spencer Road interchange, the bridge to nowhere, became a symbol of stalled development, particularly on the West Shore, where projects like Silkwind, the $1-billion Colwood Corners renewal and the $1.4-billion Capella condo towers at Bear Mountain were shelved. (The trials of Bear Mountain's Len Barrie were a yet-to-be-finished chapter in themselves.)</p>
<p>In town, the $160-million Radius mixed-use development is on hold, but work on the Uptown Centre, the Falls, the Hudson and local hospitals bucked the construction trend. Perhaps the biggest head-scratcher was the way real estate rebounded.</p>
<p>Yes, this is next year's story, but the effects were felt in 2009.</p>
<p>6 THE OLYMPICS</p>
<p>Thousands of people cheered when the Olympic torch relay began in Victoria on Oct. 30, a succession of jubilant runners holding aloft what appeared to be a giant flaming doobie. Thousands also jeered the most counter-productive demonstration ever: Anti-Olympics activists (including someone who threw marbles in the path of police horses) disrupted the relay, ruining the day for disabled kids and other would-be participants. (What's next, shooting puppies to protest homelessness?)</p>
<p>There is, to say the least, ambivalence about the 2010 Games, the uplifting nature of the event itself tempered by the associated cost, inconvenience and inaccessibility. The $900-million security measures will trip up travellers and all but shut down B.C.'s criminal court system for the month of February as 6,000 police officers from across Canada are seconded to the Games.</p>
<p>7 MEDIA MUDDLE</p>
<p>The good news story as Canadian media struggled to stay afloat in a sea of red ink: CHEK didn't drown. Employees and local investors bought the station at the beginning of September just as the plug was about to be pulled by debt-heavy <span class="companylink">Canwest Global</span>.</p>
<p>Other local outlets were wobbly, too. Canwest also owns the Times Colonist, which dropped its Monday edition in June. At Black Press, which owns Monday Magazine and the various community papers around Victoria, employees were pushed to take unpaid days off work; Torstar, which owns a 19.4 per cent stake in Black Press, declared the holdings to have no value. In March, <span class="companylink">CTVglobemedia Inc</span>. cut 118 jobs -- 28 per cent of the total workforce -- at 'A' News stations across Canada, including 18 of 100 jobs in Victoria, where they also cancelled the morning show. Several jobs were also axed at CFAX radio, owned by CTVglobemedia subsidiary CHUM.</p>
<p>8 STIMULUS SPENDING</p>
<p>To those who shrug and say, "I get my news from the Internet," where do you think the Internet gets its news?</p>
<p>Here's a new drinking game: Every time you hear the words "stimulus package," "shovel ready" or "infrastructure" on the TV news, knock back a beer. You'll be gooned before the weatherman comes on. In the capital region, the feds threw millions at everything from a McTavish Road interchange that we're not sure is the highest highway priority to a blue bridge replacement that we're not sure we need at all. The most important municipal construction project completed in 2009: The permanent outdoor urinal erected at Government and Pandora.</p>
<p>9 THOW AND HERTEL</p>
<p>The long arm of the law finally nabbed Victoria's two most infamous financial fugitives by their soiled white collars.</p>
<p>Investment adviser Ian Thow, who fled his Central Saanich waterfront estate in 2005, was arrested Feb. 17 in Portland, Ore., where he had been living in a high-end condo. He now languishes in the North Fraser Pretrial Centre in Port Coquitlam, charged with 25 counts of fraud. He is accused of bilking clients of $32 million.</p>
<p>Frank Hertel, once lauded as a high-tech visionary who would turn Victoria into Silicon Valley North, took off for Venezuela rather than face tax-evasion charges laid in 1986. The onetime CFAX Citizen of the Year, now in his 70s, has been jailed in England, awaiting word on extradition, since being arrested at Heathrow airport May 9.</p>
<p>10 MIGRANTS 2.0</p>
<p>It's deja vu all over again: Gun-toting authorities shepherd a rusty shipload of migrants into Ogden Point on Oct. 18, a day after the ship is intercepted off the West Coast. Except unlike 1999, when the arrival of four boatloads of Chinese set Islanders aflutter, the 76 men aboard the Ocean Lady, seized in Juan de Fuca Strait, were Tamils from Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The men remain in custody in Vancouver, but Canada will have to decide soon whether to free them as legitimate refugees or send them home.</p>
<p>11 THE INTERWEB</p>
<p>This was the year your grandma unfriended you on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, then Tweeted about it.</p>
<p>We all became so connected in 2009 that we couldn't hear anything beyond our ear buds, see anything beyond our screens. Your new handheld device does so much ("There's an app for that") that to call it a cellphone is like calling the Swiss army knife a knife.</p>
<p>B.C. finally decided to ban phoning/Googling/texting/sexting while driving as of Jan. 1, 2010. The <span class="companylink">Google</span> Street View cameras came to Victoria in July, blurring faces and licence plates to satisfy privacy concerns. The dashboard GPS, the best marriage-saving device since monogamy, became common. This month, a viral video (another term you just learned) showed a groom pausing in mid-wedding to change his <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> status to "married."</p>
<p>12 ROYAL VISITORS</p>
<p>It was a republican's nightmare: Visiting royals stacked up like 747s circling O'Hare in a blizzard. You couldn't set foot in downtown Victoria without having it run over by a speeding motorcade, somebody's crowned head poking through the sunroof of the limo.</p>
<p>In July came Emperor Akihito of Japan, returning with Empress Michiko to the city he first visited in 1953 while travelling to the coronation of Queen Elizabeth. Their visit was sandwiched between that of Elizabeth's youngest son, Prince Edward, and her eldest, Prince Charles, who was heard whispering excitedly to Camilla, "I think I just saw Jack Knox." Or maybe not.</p>
<p>It was like something out of CSI: Vic West, except this story was real, which made it sad.</p>
<p>13 SONGHEES SKELETON</p>
<p>In late May, a skeleton found sitting on a box in the back of a five-tonne truck abandoned in a Roundhouse project parking lot turned out to be that of Neil McLean, a homeless man in his late 60s. McLean, who had mental health issues, had been reported missing in January by his Alberta family, who had not seen him for two years. He hadn't been seen around Our Place for about a year. It appears McLean chained the truck shut from the inside, which he was known to do as a security measure.</p>
<p>14 THE RUMBLES</p>
<p>Homelessness continues to eat away at Victoria like a cancer.</p>
<p>It sounds like an earthquake, or God bowling, or James Earl Jones clearing his throat. Whatever it is, all summer long Victorians report this loud, unexplained rumbling noise that continues for up to 30 seconds at a time. Since many of the reports come from Oak Bay and Cordova Bay, the most logical explanation has something to do with a new type of fighter jet taking off from Washington state's Whidbey Island Naval Air Station.</p>
<p>Either that or your bad decisions from the '60s are coming back for a visit, Cheech.</p>
<p>15 OH, DEER</p>
<p>Sure, there's nothing new about deer in residential areas. But deer roaming Oak Bay village, cruising Yates Street, swimming in a Saanich pool, browsing in a Government Street toy store, or hogging the comfy seats at <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>? (OK, I made up that last one.) Urban-born deer were all over the City of Gardens (or, as they call it, Buffet By The Sea) this year.</p>
<p>Bunnies were on the move, too, spreading beyond UVic, where it was proposed that some of the 86 million feral rabbits be trapped, given vasectomies and adopted out to appropriate homes. This wasn't done, but nor did Victorians go for the bunny-control measures used in Helsinki (feeding them to zoo animals) or Stockholm (burning them as heating fuel).</p>
<p>We were confounded by critters in 2009. It took several levels of government to deal with a dead cow that washed up at Ogden Point. (They ended up shipping it to Alberta, which could explain why our taxes are so high). Suzy the Tiger finally left the Highlands for a ranch in the Interior.</p>
<p>And of course, we can't forget the biggest animal story of 2009: Tiger Woods turned out to be a cheetah.</p>

<p>1.July 8 would have been the opening of Michael Jackson’s This Is It tour, the title suggesting the live concerts would be not only his first in years but his last ever. As it happened, the entertainer died of a heart attack in his Los Angeles mansion on June 25. Jackson’s personal physician, Conrad Murray, admitted to administering heavy sedatives. Manslaughter? L.A. police have investigated but laid no charges.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>2.Wife of former Liberal leader Stéphane Dion, Krieber attacked his successor, Michael Ignatieff, on her <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page and predicted further hard times for the party under his leadership. “For having refused the historic coalition that could have placed it at the head of the left,” Krieber claimed, “it will be punished by history.” She was referring to her husband’s abortive 2008 attempt to defeat the minority Conservative government.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>3.Released on Feb. 12, UR was – and still is – available only as a download for the Amazon Kindle reading device. Since the plot concerns an English teacher who himself buys a Kindle, the “book” was viewed by some as an infomercial for the gadget. The Kindle arrived in Canada in November. Was it under the tree?</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>4. Bertram Earl Jones is the full name of the accused West Island ponzi schemer Earl Jones. The initial news reports of July 11 used the triple-barrelled formula.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>5. Stewart Cink won the British Open in July but much attention was focused on his fellow American, 59-year-old Tom Watson, who forced a four-hole playoff. Watson, who was working on a replaced hip, had won the Open on the same Scottish course in 1977.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>6. Iceland’s economy crashed in 2008 and Geir (Icelanders use given names) took much of the heat. His resignation as chairman of the Independence party also mentioned his diagnosis with a tumour.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>7. The former Vision Montréal leader and lieutenant to mayoral candidate Louise Harel invoked the image of the Mafia in a going-down-swinging interview on Radio-Canada. “Is there a Mafia system that controls city hall?” the confessed money-taker asked himself. “The response is yes.”</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>8. Chicago, Madrid and Tokyo lost to Rio de Janeiro as the site of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. The Brazilian city will be the first in South America to play host to an Olympiad. Chicago lost despite the high-profile support of Barack Obama.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>9. The Montreal Symphony Orchestra (established 1934) linked itself conceptually to the Montreal Canadiens (established 1909) in a joint sound-and-light birthday celebration in the Bell Centre. Kent Nagano led the orchestra. The hockey team was in Long Island, but many sweater-clad veterans showed up.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>10. A “double bird strike” less than a minute after takeoff from New York’s LaGuardia Airport landed a <span class="companylink">US Airways</span> flight in the Hudson River. Pilot Chesley B. “Sully” Sullenberger III got credit for saving all 155 people aboard, some of whom had to be rescued by police divers. American civil aircraft are estimated to have experienced about 65,000 bird strikes between 1990 and 2005.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>11.Son of the head of <span class="companylink">Paramount Pictures</span>, Schulberg wrote On the Waterfront, a film directed by his fellow friendly witness to the House Un-American Activities Committee, Elia Kazan. Washed-up boxer Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) lamented how he “coulda been a contender” in the working-class classic.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>12. Oops. The Nivose was a French naval patrol boat, not the commercial ship the 11 Somali smalltimers took it to be. The three pirate craft (two for attack, one for supplies) were promptly seized, along with the hapless crew.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>13. Oops. Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff thought it was time for a non-confidence vote against the Tories and Stephen Harper. The NDP under Jack Layton had different ideas and abstained. “Mr. Harper, your time is up,” will likely live in political memory for many years.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>14. The 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner contracted the H1N1 influenza virus and emerged unscathed. Arias had made medical news the previous year when cysts on his vocal cords led his physicians to prescribe a tough measure for a pol: no talking for a month.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>15. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, also in the news for his partying habits, moved the summit from Sardinia to L’Aquila after an earthquake rocked the town, the capital of Abruzzo. The April 6 earthquake killed 286 and damaged historical buildings. Leaders, including Stephen Harper, got tours of the devastated city.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>16. “Yankee Stadium” now refers not to the 1923 House that Ruth Built but a snazzy $1.5 billion park nearby. Many of the stratospherically-priced best seats remained empty – not a good look on television.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>17.So said U.S. President Barack Obama in Stockholm on Dec. 10 as he accepted his early-bird-special Nobel Peace Prize. “... I am at the beginning, and not the end, of my labours on the world stage,” he continued by way of explaining his reservations.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>18. What the U.S. Geological Survey detected as a 4.7-magnitude earthquake at around 10 a.m. Eastern Time was described by the North Korean government itself as a nuclear test about an hour later. Missile firings by the rogue nation followed, just in case we did not get the point. The macho display was probably meant to counter any notion that the likely retirement of ailing dictator Kim Jong-il would produce a less bellicose foreign policy.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>19. On June 28 about 100 soldiers stormed the presidential residence in the little-known capital of Honduras and flew its occupant, Manuel Zelaya, to Costa Rica. Zelaya had been trying, against the decision of the Supreme Court, to eliminate constitutionally entrenched presidential term limits. Pronounce Tegucigalpa “te-goo-see-GAL-pa.”</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>20. The solar eclipse of July 22 could been seen through wide areas of China, India, Japan and southeast Asia. To say it drew a crowd is putting it mildly. The totality duration of 6 minutes 39 seconds (not extraordinary in its own right) will not be exceeded until 2132.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>21.The terrorist convicted of 270 counts of murder for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 was released from detention in Scotland because he was suffering from prostate cancer. Many were shocked by the “compassionate” action of the Scottish government. Megrahi got a hero’s welcome and is now living in his family villa.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>22. The quick answer is Europe; European Union is more precise; European Council is more precise still. The 62-year-old Belgian prime minister was thought by many to be a bland choice for the first president of a united Europe. Why not Tony Blair?</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>23. Barack Obama lost no time after his inauguration in ordering the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detainment facility in Cuba. On Dec. 15 the U.S. president named the Thomson Correctional Centre, in Thomson, Illinois as the new home of the 210 remaining Gitmo prisoners. Congressional approval and structural modifications of the prison are still months away.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>24. Meeting in Fredericton, Jean Charest of Quebec and Shawn Graham, his counterpart in New Brunswick, agreed to the sale of <span class="companylink">NB Power</span> to <span class="companylink">Hydro-Québec</span> for $4.8 billion, a sum that would retire the eastern utility’s debt. Assurances of rate freezes did not completely quell worries in the maritime province.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>25. Claude Lévi-Strauss asserted the similarity of human cultures everywhere and bolstered the anthropology of the still-trendy philosophy of structuralism. He is not to be confused with the American jeans manufacturer.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>26. “After much prayer and months of careful thought,” Oprah Winfrey announced that her Chicago-based show would end in Sept. 2011. This was one of the great non-stories of the year: The interview queen is expected simply to revive the show on OWN -- the Oprah Winfrey Network.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>27. Former Outremont MP Martin Cauchon wanted to make a comeback, against the wishes of Quebec Liberal Party lieutenant Denis Coderre, who had earmarked the plum riding for businesswoman Nathalie Le Prohon. (She later withdrew.) Overruled by Michael Ignatieff and (allegedly) the Toronto-based organizers of the party, Coderre resigned. Much punditry ensued.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>28. Cellist Yo-Yo Ma ended up playing backup to Stephen Harper in the NACO gala. The PM waged battle against his anti-arts image by sitting at the piano and singing With A Little Help From My Friends.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>29. Slumping economy notwithstanding, the $11-billion CityCentre hotel, casino and shopping complex opened in the heart of Las Vegas Blvd., or the Strip, as it is popularly known. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification is promised in a city not know for green consciousness.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>30. Subject of a scandal himself, the Late Show host was making light of the Gillette decision to drop its advertisements featuring Tiger Woods. The Proctor & Gamble company said it wanted to “support his desire for privacy.”</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>31. On Feb. 12 three judges hearing separate cases found that the combined MMR vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella could not be linked to autism. The families were seeking compensation from a federal vaccine-injury fund. Suspicions about the supposed side effects of shots – including the H1N1 flu vaccine – appear to be ineradicable.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>32. Electoral authorities in Iran wasted no time in announcing the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by a surprising margin of 63 per cent. Nor did they waste much effort in counting the paper ballots, in the view of the young Iranians who supported runner-up Mir Hussein Moussavi. Demonstrations were of no avail.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>33. Bryant got involved in an onroad argument that ended in the death of bicycle courier Darcy Allen Shepherd. Was Shepherd intoxicated? Did he seize the steering wheel of Bryant’s Saab? All this will surely be aired in the trial expected in January.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>34. Six-year-old Falcon Heene became Balloon Boy after world media followed his supposed Oct. 15 voyage in Colorado aboard a home-made Helium balloon. In fact he was hiding in the Heene family home. “...We did this for the show,” the young non-pilot said in a television interview, referring to his publicity-obsessed parents.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>35. U.S. District Judge Denny Chin gave the 71-year-old Ponzi schemer the theoretical maximum of 150 years, a sentence with no parole. “Symbolism is important,” Judge Chin explained.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>36. Car Allowance Rebate System is clear enough but Cash for Clunkers flowed more readily off the tongue. The $1-billion program ran out of cash (but not clunkers) just days after transactions started on July 24. An extra $2 billion extended the program through most of August.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>37. The water was found in a permanently shadowed crater near the south pole of the moon. The upper stage of NASA’s Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) obligingly crashed while the rest of the spacecraft collected post-traumatic data from the plume of ejecta. Water on the moon means that it might be possible to start a colony there. Now all we need is a reason to go.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>38. Italian-born, Montreal-trained Arturo Gatti, renowned for his all-out style, was found dead on July 11 in a hotel room in a coastal Brazilian city where the retired boxer was planning to attend his sister’s wedding, Did Amanda Rodrigues, his ex-stripper wife, strangle him (as Brazilian authorities initially suspected) or did he hang himself (as they later concluded)?</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>39. What better time than midnight to see The Twilight Saga: New Moon, a vampire movie based on Stephenie Meyer’s wildly successful vampire romances for young adults? The early start helped propel the film to a record single-day domestic gross of $72.7 million.</p>
<p>sss</p>
<p>40. This was how many Saskatchewan Roughriders were on the field for an unsuccessful Montreal Alouettes field goal attempt in the dying seconds of the Grey Cup game in Calgary. The ensuing penalty gave placekicker Damon Duval his second chance, which he nailed, and pushing the Als ahead of their stunned opponents, 28-27.</p>
