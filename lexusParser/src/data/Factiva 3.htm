<p>WINNIPEG -- At 3:12 p.m. last Wednesday, 16-year-old Sherrie Akammak was getting dressed for her first-ever trip to a real movie theatre when her eyes widened and her jaw dropped.</p>
<p>She looked across the drab boarding-house room in Winnipeg where she had been confined for three weeks and yelled to her mother.</p>
<p>“It's ready. We have to go.”</p>
<p>Her mother, Theresa Akammak, had been in this position before – 12 times before, to be precise, nine for herself and three for another daughter. Yet her familiarity with the ritual of childbirth did little to allay her anxiety. In a panic, she phoned downstairs to reception at the Kivalliq Inuit Centre.</p>
<p>“My daughter's going into labour,” she said. “We need a van. Now.” In the world of Inuit women living 1,200 kilometres north of Winnipeg in Arviat, Nunavut, the anticipation of birth is often tinged with premonitions of death.</p>
<p>Like most communities in the North, Arviat, the third-largest settlement in the territory (population 2,100) and home to Canada's highest birth rate (roughly 35 per 1,000 people, compared to a national average of 10.3) has no permanent doctor, no hospital, no midwife, no public health nurse – no one to help the 70 or so women who get pregnant every year, save for seven overworked nurses at the health centre. That's why most pregnant women here, like Sherrie, are flown south to cities like Winnipeg in order to give birth. But even then, there are problems.</p>
<p>Sherrie's sister miscarried once and then lost a premature child when the Medevac plane didn't arrive on time. The family knows dozens of women – many barely past puberty – with similar stories.</p>
<p>The statistics on aboriginal infant care in Canada are similarly bleak. An Inuit baby is 3½ times more likely to die before its first birthday than a non-Inuit newborn. (The infant mortality rate in Nunavut is the highest in the country, at 15.1 deaths for every 1,000 live births, compared with a national average of 5.1.) Inuit children have the highest rate of hospital admission for lower respiratory tract infections in the world. Compared with other children, aboriginal offspring are 50 times more likely to contract pneumonia, 80 times more likely to catch chicken pox and seven times more likely to be born to a teenage mother. Around 40 per cent report chronic illness.</p>
<p>Canada will invite close international scrutiny of those dismal numbers at this month's G8 summit when it quarterbacks a multibillion-dollar plan to improve maternal health in the developing world. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has spoken passionately about his desire to improve the lot of women and children in poor nations, but critics say there is a desperate maternal plight right here, in his own country.</p>
<p>“I was absolutely shocked,” said Shirley Tagalik, a member of Arviat's health committee, of the moment she heard about Mr. Harper's international maternal health initiative. “I don't deny that other countries need help, but don't they know what's going on up here in their own backyard?”</p>
<p>‘I'm very, very homesick'</p>
<p>The day before her water broke, Sherrie Akammak sat in a booth in Winnipeg's famed Pancake House, desultorily pushing a hamburger and fries around her plate. She wasn't hungry, but couldn't refuse a rare opportunity to leave the centre – her own personal “jail cell” as she calls it.</p>
<p>She feigned shyness, preferring to speak with her body in the Inuit custom – raised eyebrows for ii, or yes; a squint for nau, or no; and shrugged shoulders, universal teen-speak for “Don't know, don't care, enough with the dumb questions already.” Yes, Sherrie Akammak – she of teal fingernails, broad child-like cheeks, short black hair and faded hoodie – is 16 and acts 16, even when it comes to this whole pregnancy thing. “Boring,” she says of the past nine months, as she stares out the booth window towards Arviat, 1,226 kilometres due north. “I want to go home.”</p>
<p>She's here because she has to be. Aside from Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet and Cambridge Bay, communities in physician-starved Nunavut shuttle roughly 85 per cent of their pregnant women to faraway hospitals to give birth. Every year this same “boarding-out” ritual takes thousands of mothers from isolated aboriginal communities across the country. For periods of up to a month, they are confined to boarding houses like the Kivalliq Inuit Centre, where Internet time costs $5 for 40 minutes, the food doesn't hold a candle to raw caribou, and there's little more to do than sit around and think about cigarettes.</p>
<p>Boarding out is one of those antiquated quirks of northern health care that temporarily splits families, strains expectant mothers and racks up a $12,000 tab for even the lowest-risk birth. Altogether, the maternity flights comprise roughly one-third of all medical travel expenses in Nunavut.</p>
<p>“I wish she could be doing schoolwork,” Theresa says of her daughter, who should be finishing Grade 9 this month. “But the school didn't have any correspondence materials. So she's here missing school. We go out and smoke to pass time. We know it's not good.”</p>
<p>The solution may seem obvious – train and hire locals to deliver babies in communities – but Arviat offers an example of a town, like so many in the North, that flouts easy fixes. This is, after all, a hamlet that's a nine-hour Ski-Doo ride away from the nearest bank.</p>
<p>In 2007, work began to transform the town's former health centre into a state-of-the-art birthing centre. The idea was to emulate similar efforts in northern Quebec and Greenland, where government investment has brought midwives to towns of little over 100 people. In Greenland alone, this has helped slash the Inuit infant mortality rate to half that of Canada.</p>
<p>Arviat began modestly, hiring two midwives to give classes on breathing, nutrition, breastfeeding and even yoga – lessons that had been lost over previous decades as responsibility for birth was taken from the hands of traditional Inuit midwives and placed with itinerant doctors.</p>
<p>And then the whole effort stalled. The two midwives burned out on Arviat's overwhelming birth rate, and the Nunavut government denied requests to lay out another $90,000 annual salary to hire an extra midwife. Today the new birthing centre lies unfinished and empty, an aborted effort to improve the lot of expectant mothers.</p>
<p>Pauline Copeland gave birth in Arviat with the help of these midwives two years ago, and recalled the excitement she felt at being able to remain at home and avail herself of a choice many Inuit have not been able to make for decades. Last week, she found herself in Winnipeg again, preparing to give birth to her fifth child.</p>
<p>“I'm very, very homesick,” she confessed, over her umpteenth southern breakfast of plain white toast. “We have the big fishing derby this week and I'm missing it… Some moms, they hide their bellies just so they don't have to come down here. Maybe that's not such a bad idea.”</p>
<p>Money where it matters</p>
<p>Given the social and financial costs of the boarding out initiative, reviving the Arviat birthing centre would seem a smart, reasonable policy objective. Thus far, however, its future has remained in limbo, the subject of finger-pointing among different levels of government.</p>
<p>Ms. Tagalik, Arviat's health committee member, knows the anguish of boarding out firsthand. She moved North to teach in the 1970s, and at 27 she was forced to fly to Churchill, Man., to give birth.</p>
<p>That experience has informed her pleas for a renewal of the midwife program – pleas she says are being ignored by the government of Nunavut, which has responded by removing the whole program.</p>
<p>Eva Aariak, Nunavut's Premier, agrees that local births are important – she was born in a hunting camp with the aid of a traditional midwife, and laments that new generations can't be. Yet she places the blame at the feet of Ottawa, and argues that until the federal government grants Nunavut the power to collect its own resource revenue – a hotly debated process known as devolution – the cash-strapped territory will struggle to make any significant investments in maternal health.</p>
<p>“We have a long-term strategy to add midwives and birthing centres,” she said during an interview in Yellowknife. “Unfortunately, this [federal] government is concentrating, because it's a minority, more on short-term investment.”</p>
<p>In an e-mailed response, a spokeswoman for federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq insisted that the Conservatives had committed $285-million over two years toward improving aboriginal health – including maternal well-being – and $60-million aimed at improving community-level access to health services in the North.</p>
<p>The numbers and the politics don't seem to matter much to the women who are routinely uprooted and displaced during their pregnancies. “I don't know,” said Theresa Akammak when asked about the recent health investments. “We are always hearing about improvements. We are not always seeing them.”</p>
<p>She had accompanied her daughter, Sherrie, to the third floor of the Winnipeg Health Sciences Centre Women's Hospital shortly before 4 p.m. that Wednesday afternoon, not long after her water broke.</p>
<p>An obstetrician conducted an ultrasound, then closely considered Sherrie's age, size and health before deciding to perform a C-section. Theresa fretted for hours. By morning, however, she was a gleaming grandmother. At 12:45 a.m., Sherrie gave birth to Tuni Mary, named after a friend who died of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>“A little girl,” Theresa gloated in a room several worlds away from home. “She's big, 8½ pounds. And everyone's fine. My daughter is healthy. Hopefully we can go home very soon. We are too long away.”</p>

<p>This editorial is from the Montreal Gazette.</p>
<p>The H1N1 pandemic didn't so much sweep through Canada as putter along, leaving Canadians relatively unscathed but feeling confused and much poorer.</p>
<p>Canada spent $2 billion trying to inoculate every man, woman, and child in the country. But as a new report points out, it failed quite miserably to do that in many provinces. The highest provincial inoculation rate was in Newfoundland, at 70 per cent. Alberta's rate was the lowest -- 35 per cent. In Hamilton, Ont., barely 19 per cent to 25 per cent of people were inoculated.</p>
<p>For all the panic and the government's desperate scrambling to get its hands on 50 million doses of vaccine, in Canada H1N1 left fewer dead and ill than a run-of-the-mill influenza in any given year. Does this mean our response to the pandemic was a failure? That's not a useful way to look at it. We were lucky. H1N1 was not as deadly as international medical experts had originally feared it would be.</p>
<p>Some things did go wrong: Alberta opened its vaccination clinics to all, ignoring the agreed-on priority list in which small children and pregnant women would be inoculated first. Clinics were promptly over-run and ran out of vaccine. Ontario also used a first-come, first-inoculated policy, resulting in people waiting for hours in lineups.</p>
<p>The media, it has to be admitted, sometimes stoked a sense of panic. It was not helpful to demand elected officials resign if a single person died. Other people took too sanguine an approach, convinced that health officials were over-reacting.</p>
<p>The best thing would be to consider our response the equivalent of a fire drill. We had a chance to see how well we could roll out a countrywide inoculation program under pressure.</p>
<p>Let's learn from the past.</p>

</p>
<p>A new report on H1N1 vaccination rates shows the percentage of Hamiltonians who got their swine-flu shot was among the lowest in Canada.</p>
<p>The statistics, gathered from public health authorities and polling data, revealed Hamilton had a swine flu vaccination rate of 19 per cent to 25 per cent, while cities in the Maritimes, Montreal and Ottawa had rates above 50 per cent.</p>
<p>Of the reported figures, St. John's and the surrounding area had the highest vaccination rate, with 68.7 per cent, while Hamilton had the lowest.</p>
<p>Rates were not available for all Canadian cities.</p>
<p>Hamilton medical officer of health Dr. Elizabeth Richardson said the city's public health is looking at how these other regions were able to achieve such high vaccination rates.</p>
<p>"We want to look at their areas and see what worked -- what do we think it was that worked in those areas compared with (Hamilton)," she said yesterday.</p>
<p>A public health study released in March showed less than 20 per cent of Hamilton's population was vaccinated for swine flu, well below the initial target of 75 per cent.</p>
<p>Between Oct. 26 and Feb. 6, 96,242 people were vaccinated. About 60,000 got their shots at public health units, and the remaining people went to their family doctors.</p>
<p>Richardson said there are many factors at play in a vaccination campaign, including the time lapse between when the swine flu hit the region and when vaccine was available, the communication process, the vaccine supply, and the system for moving people through clinics.</p>
<p>High-risk groups were vaccinated quickly in Hamilton, but the city had to wait for the go-ahead from the province to start on the general public, Richardson said.</p>
<p>"We had people who wanted to be vaccinated but could not ... I'm sure that had a negative impact on them."</p>
<p>Richardson said one question to pose is whether timelines for eligibility groups would be more effective if determined by local needs.</p>
<p>She also pointed to effective booking systems in Sault Ste. Marie where people were told what time to come in for a vaccination as opposed to arriving at a clinic and being discouraged by the long lineup.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Learn from H1N1 crisis</b>
</div><div>464 words</div><div>4 June 2010</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu pandemic has moved - or, rather, seems to have moved - into the medical history books. Thankfully, this virus never turned out to be quite as dangerous to the general population as initially feared. The virus, however, was a contributing factor to the deaths of several local residents who had medical conditions that made them more susceptible to it.</p>
<p>Medical officials and health ministries in this country should now assess what they did during the crisis. The point of looking back is not to criticize those who made decisions in good faith but to learn how better to manage similar viral outbreaks in future. Sadly, in this age when travelling around the world is easy there is little doubt that more viruses will spread around the globe.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief officer of health, has concluded that about 38 per cent of Ontarians received the H1N1 vaccine. This is considerably below the province's target. It is also one of the lowest rates for any Canadian province. Speaking last December, King said this province wanted to vaccinate about 75 per cent of Ontarians.</p>
<p>The province should try to find out why relatively few Ontarians bothered to get the shot. Did people divide themselves into the high-risk category and the not-so-high risk group and decide not to get the vaccine if they were in the lower-risk group? If this happened, did the people who perceived themselves as not being at risk have a false sense of security? Might they have suffered if the virus had been more powerful?</p>
<p>Administrative problems may also have contributed to a lower turnout than should have occurred. Dr. King is quite frank in acknowledging that health officials often did not know how much vaccine they would have to distribute.</p>
<p>Behind all the problems was an imbalance between supply and demand. The vaccine was in short supply when the virus was in its acute stage, but more than enough was available later when the virus appeared not to be so virulent.</p>
<p>The shortages caused local medical officials in some cases to close clinics long before the intended closing time. The clinics simply didn't have enough vaccine to give to everyone who showed up. Naturally, this upset some people who wanted the vaccine.</p>
<p>The co-ordination between the federal government, which looked after the vaccine at what might be called a wholesale level, and the provincial governments, which supplied the vaccine to the public, was flawed. Both levels of government would be wise to see if they could establish a better communications protocol. Such a protocol, of course, should be arranged well in advance of a pandemic when medical officials have no time to plan and can only react.</p>

<p>Toronto --</p>
<p>The World Health Organization is facing criticism of its handling of the H1N1 pandemic as two new reports accuse the global health body of failing to disclose possible ties with the pharmaceutical industry and of pushing countries to waste millions of dollars by overstating the threat.</p>
<p>The reports from Europe were released on Friday, at the end of a week in which the WHO said that the H1N1 pandemic is not over, although its most intense activity has passed in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>The health committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe accused the WHO of exaggerating the threat of H1N1, unnecessarily scaring the public and causing countries to waste millions of dollars fighting it. A report by BMJ, a prominent medical journal in Britain, said the WHO relied on advice from scientists with ties to pharmaceutical companies when it developed guidelines on the use of antiviral drugs, and it asked why the names of those who sit on the WHO’s emergency committee are shrouded in secrecy.</p>
<p>A WHO spokesman said the agency’s response to the virus was necessary given its potential threat, and that the organization is careful not to let the drug industry influence its decision making.</p>
<p>“I think there will always be perhaps attempts by the pharmaceutical industry. But WHO has systems in place to prevent any attempts to exert undue influence. Those are stopped,” Gregory Hartl said.</p>
<p>The BMJ article said three experts who received payments from Roche Holdings AG and GlaxoSmithKline PLC, manufacturers of antiviral drugs, also helped in preparing pandemic guidelines in 2004, which included the use of antivirals. The WHO did not publicly disclose their conflicts of interest, the journal stated. Further, the 16 emergency committee members who advise director-general Margaret Chan are known only to people within the WHO, the journal said.</p>
<p>But Mr. Hartl said it’s standard procedure at the WHO for everyone to declare their conflicts. He said the names of emergency committee members won’t be disclosed until their work is completed because “there could be any number of different pressures which would be placed on these committee members. ... It would make it far more difficult for these people to give good advice if their names were public.”</p>
<p>Donald Low, chief microbiologist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, said it’s not surprising that scientists have some association with industry at some point in their careers. But he agreed with the BMJ that the names of the committee members and their possible conflicts of interest should be made public.</p>

<p>World Health Organization chief Margaret Chan on Thursday decided to maintain a pandemic alert nearly a year after she placed the world on maximum readiness for the new swine flu virus. The WHO said cases of A(H1N1) influenza were expected to continue in the coming weeks mainly during the southern hemisphere's flu season. The situation is to be reassessed by mid-July, when full information on the winter influenza season in the south was available. Last year, tropical areas of the Caribbean and South Asia experienced their most intense bouts of swine flu in July.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- Canada's Health Minister says vaccination is a provincial matter and washed the federal government's hands of responsibility for the low H1N1 inoculation rates in provinces west of Quebec.</p>
<p>Asked in an interview Thursday if Ottawa bears any blame for the flawed vaccine rollout in Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario, which saw just over a third of their populations inoculated against the pandemic virus, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq responded: “Provinces and territories deliver health care.”</p>
<p>Provinces, in the midst of assessing their response to the pandemic, argue that their planning was affected because they didn't know early on how much vaccine they would receive week to week from the federal government. The public, as a result, grew impatient, confused and eventually turned off from the vaccine, they say.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Manitoba's Health Minister, Theresa Oswald, said the delivery of vaccine was a joint responsibility of Ottawa and the provinces and territories. “Manitoba is not blaming the federal government for the lack of vaccine in the early days of the campaign, but the fact remains that Manitoba faced ongoing vaccine shortages while demand was at its highest, which ultimately affected our final vaccination rate,” the spokesman said Thursday.</p>
<p>Ontario's Health Minister Deb Matthews added that vaccine supply was inadequate when people wanted it, and was in surplus when demand dropped. “All that being said, everyone who wanted the H1N1 shot did get the shot and the level of collaboration was unprecedented, but the co-ordination and communication that characterized our national response needs to be improved,” she said.</p>
<p>Provinces west of Quebec had a difficult time getting more than half their populations vaccinated, according to public health authorities. Meanwhile, Quebec, the Atlantic provinces and the three territories successfully inoculated more than half of their citizens.</p>
<p>Terres-Cries-de-la-Baie-James, a sprawling swath of boreal forest in northwestern Quebec, managed to vaccinate 12,397 people, or 84 per cent of its mostly Cree population. Health officials say people were keen to get the vaccine, because nearly everyone knew someone who had the virus during the first wave. Officials set up clinics in all nine of the region's towns and ran a media campaign showing folk singer Claude McKenzie and Cree Grand Chief Matthew Coon Come getting their vaccine shots.</p>
<p>“We put it on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Twitter, radio. Radio was essential to the success,” said Jason Coonishish of Cree Health, explaining that it was a crucial way to tell residents to head into town for the vaccine clinics. “Some people were travelling 50 to 100 kilometres, easy. Some of them came by Ski-Doo.”</p>
<p>Ms. Aglukkaq said going forward, it will be important to examine why such places as Newfoundland had a 70-per-cent vaccination rate, and Ontario was around 38 per cent. She said one of the biggest challenges during the pandemic was correcting inaccurate information fed to the public, and accounted for the lower number of people in large provinces turning up at flu clinics.</p>
<p>“Every jurisdiction will be evaluating how they did and they will be putting forward their own plans in terms of implementing improvements to that, and there's lessons to be learned in that,” she said. “If there's ways that we can improve in assisting provinces, certainly we'll be there.”</p>

</p>
<p>Nearly half of Saskatoon's residents received the H1N1 vaccination during the flu outbreak late last year, figures from the Saskatoon Health Region show.</p>
<p>That number -- 48 per cent -- puts the city near the middle of the pack compared to other parts of Canada. Provincially, Saskatchewan had a 50 per cent vaccination rate.</p>
<p>"I think in Saskatchewan and Saskatoon, we did very well," said Dr. Ross Findlater, a deputy medical health officer with the region, "which isn't to say things couldn't be done better a next time, if there is a next time."</p>
<p>Vaccination rates across the country ranged from 35 per cent in Alberta to 70 per cent in Newfoundland and Labrador. Canada's rates also compare favourably with the U.S., where about one-quarter of residents got the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>In Saskatoon, the health region identified partway through the vaccination campaign that men in their 20s were among the least likely to get the vaccine, and that remained consistent in the final numbers, with about 20 per cent of men aged 20 to 25 getting immunized.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, elderly people (over 60 years old) had a vaccination rate of about 60 per cent and young children (under 10 years old) had a vaccination rate of about 70 per cent.</p>
<p>"I think the coverage of young kids, 70 per cent, is really very remarkable considering it was a new vaccine and there were problems in having enough supply to meet demand," said Findlater.</p>
<p>The number of children actually protected from the virus in the future will be higher than that, Findlater said, because some will be immune due to having contracted the virus.</p>
<p>Last fall, there were 648 confirmed cases of H1N1 in the Saskatoon Health Region, but that number is only a "very small proportion" of the total number of cases because a small proportion of those infected sought health care, and an even smaller proportion was tested, said Findlater.</p>
<p>One of the difficulties in delivering the vaccine was that the H1N1 flu was already present, so the health region had to not only roll out a mass immunization plan, but also deal with higher numbers of patients.</p>
<p>"I'm aware that there's a number of different questions out there," said Findlater. "Some people wonder whether it was all an overreaction. I think it's maybe easier to say that now than it was to say that in November when we had quite a few people sick here and we're trying to immunize people."</p>
<p>Having one large centralized vaccination site within the city at Prairieland Park -- as well as a number of smaller sites throughout the rest of the city and surrounding areas -- worked fairly well, said Findlater. However, vaccination rates within the city were slightly higher than in the rural areas for people between the ages of 35 and 75, which could indicate access was an issue.</p>
<p>Overall, 145,391 people in the Saskatoon Health Region were vaccinated, out of a total population of 300,638.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Ontario's pandemic vaccine program was a classic case of supply-demand mismatch, a new report on the province's response to the H1N1 outbreak suggests.</p>
<p>There wasn't enough vaccine when the public was clamouring for it and by the time supplies had swelled, demand was fading, according to a report from Dr. Arlene King, the province's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"To be blunt, from Oct. 26, the date of the launch of our H1N1 immunization program, there was never an alignment between H1N1 vaccine supply, demand and our capacity to deliver it," King said yesterday.</p>
<p>She said a variety of factors were to blame, not least of which was the fact the province didn't know from one week to the next how much vaccine it would be getting from the federal government.</p>
<p>"We were hearing in real time -- literally in real time -- how much vaccine we were going to get and planning our programs accordingly," she said.</p>
<p>"And I can tell you that literally every day we were sitting down determining whether or not we could expand our priority group list, depending on how much vaccine we thought we were going to get and how much we thought we had left."</p>
<p>Provincial Health Minister Deb Matthews supported her chief public health official.</p>
<p>"I think everybody has to take a share of the responsibility," said Matthews when asked who was to blame for the lengthy lineups that dogged the early days of the vaccine rollout.</p>
<p>"I think for sure, not having the supply of vaccine and not having a certain supply of vaccine made it very, very difficult to sequence ... the distribution of the vaccine. So the certainty of supply was a huge factor."</p>
<p>King estimated about 38 per cent of Ontarians were vaccinated, which is near the low end of vaccination rates among provinces and territories.</p>
<p>But even within Ontario there was wide variation from region to region, she said, adding further study will be needed to try to understand why some areas managed to vaccinate far more people than others.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'Perfect storm' helped create reform</b>
</div><div>Patty Randall   </div>

</p>
<p>Browsing our Museum of Civilization's timeline series, you can't help but think that the 'perfect conditions' meteorologist Bob Case described to author S. Junger, who was researching a book about a real-life hurricane, is eerily similar of what happened between 1914 and 1918 in our own country to help create health care reform.</p>
<p>Canada faced extraordinary circumstances from four different situations. Each was overwhelming, combined they formed a 'perfect storm'. The consequences forced ordinary Canadians to demand change.</p>
<p>Looking back, 1914, Canada was a colony in the British Empire, population approximately 7.5 million, many of whom were recent immigrants.</p>
<p>Alberta and Saskatchewan were the newest provinces created in 1905; Newfoundland was still a separate colony. Canada had 8 medical schools with 1,792 students in all -- 321 doctors graduated that year and the majority went into private practice as general practitioners.</p>
<p>Four 'perfect storm' conditions converged.</p>
<p>WW1 exposed the poor health condition of our citizens!</p>
<p>That same year Britain declared war on Germany and doctors here discovered numerous health problems as Canadians enlisted (active tuberculosis, bad teeth, sexually transmitted infections).</p>
<p>They also found many recruits unfit for duty because of past childhood ailments (infectious diseases such as smallpox, diphtheria, typhoid, scarlet fever, measles).</p>
<p>These findings, plus earlier reports of high maternal and infant death rates in our cities, launched calls for a national preventive services health department to be created to ease the problems of communicable diseases.</p>
<p>The conscription crisis forced compromise!</p>
<p>Winning the war was a priority for Conservative Prime Minister Robert Borden, thus he promised to maintain a field force of 500,000 soldiers and to supply food and munitions to the Allied forces.</p>
<p>But fewer men volunteered for overseas service as the war dragged on. Thus, in 1917, the government decided to introduce military conscription.</p>
<p>It became a controversial election issue and caused a split in the opposition Liberal Party led by Sir Wilfrid Laurier. The Borden government was forced into an alliance with some of the pro-conscription Liberals.</p>
<p>One of the conditions the Liberals called for, so as to join a Union government led by Borden, was the formation of a federal health department.</p>
<p>The Halifax Explosion signalled our lack of emergency planning!</p>
<p>On December 6, 1917, once again the need for health-action was starkly revealed when the Halifax Explosion occurred. Two ships in the narrows of Halifax military harbour (one of the world's greatest natural harbours) rubbed together, one carried explosives.</p>
<p>The resulting flames caused a massive explosion and a huge tidal wave, all within 10 seconds! (This was the second biggest man-made explosion in history, the first is the bombing of Japan.)</p>
<p>1,963 died, 9,000 were injured and 25,000 became homeless as 2.5 kilometres were levelled. The situation worsened when a six-day blizzard hit immediately after the catastrophe.</p>
<p>The "Shattered City" as it became informally known, urgently needed medical assistance, supplies and help. Canadians responded rapidly, but help came more swiftly from Massachusetts. (Halifax still sends Boston a Xmas tree every year in thanks for their support.)</p>
<p>At the same time, the services needed to deal with the orphans, the blind and the disabled from this disaster were also required for the 160,000 returning wounded servicemen.</p>
<p>As a result, the Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment was created in 1918 to run convalescent hospitals, sanatoriums and homes, pay disability allowances, operate an artificial limb and surgical appliance factory, work with out-patients with tuberculosis, dental and mental health conditions, help servicemen find jobs, occupational therapy was pioneered in these hospitals.</p>
<p>Up until then, Canadians had been expected to pay for their own care or seek aid from municipal or provincial facilities. Now, for the first time, the federal government was helping fund health services.</p>
<p>An influenza pandemic revealed the limits of our system!</p>
<p>Then during the final battles in the spring of 1918, a new enemy appeared. 'Spanish flu' (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) attacked troops on both sides of the conflict. The disease quickly struck our troops overseas plus those in camps at home.</p>
<p>(Note: The pandemic lasted from March 1918 to June 1920, between 50 and 100 million, about 3% of the world's population of 1.6 billion at that time, died of the disease making it the deadliest natural disaster in human history.)</p>
<p>The outbreak spread to our civilian population, killing many of our young adults between 20 and 45. Communities rallied to provide food, bedding, fuel and care to those ill, but the horrifying speed of the epidemic clearly highlighted our country's need for more health care professionals, facilities and medical research.</p>
<p>The resulting loss of 50,000 of our young men and women to the flu in addition to the 60,000 war dead prompted Canadians to demand government action to protect upcoming generations from similar suffering.</p>
<p>Meanwhile: New political parties were being formed, such as the <span class="companylink">United Farmers of Alberta</span> and the National Progressive Party, because of growing differences between urban and rural needs. Several of these new provincial parties supported public health measures that would improve access by all to health services.</p>
<p>The upshot: These 4 crises-driven factors contributed significantly to the establishment of our federal Department of Health in 1919!</p>

</div><div>Canwest News Service</div>

</p>
<p>Washington state responded to an NDP freedom of information request three months ago, while the B.C. government is still mulling an identical request submitted at the same time.</p>
<p>The NDP submitted the two requests on Jan. 4, seeking records relating to joint cabinet meetings held a few months earlier, led by Gov. Christine Gregoire and Premier Gordon Campbell.</p>
<p>The province issued a fairly detailed news release after the October meeting, but the NDP was curious about the framework and some of the intricacies of the various policies discussed.</p>
<p>On Feb. 3, the New Democrats got a note back from Gregoire's office. It offered all the requested documents for a grand sum of $63.60. The NDP paid the bill and on March 3, it received 300 pages of documentation containing everything you'd want to know about the work that went into discussing Olympic readiness, climate change initiatives, border issues, H1N1 plans and more.</p>
<p>Not a single page had been whited-out or censored. The governor's response even includes the expenses of the state officials who worked on meetings leading up to the joint cabinet session.</p>
<p>From B.C., all the NDP has received is a note from Campbell's office on Feb. 11 asking for an extension until the end of March before responding.</p>
<p>"Well, here we are today and we still haven't seen any documents," NDP leader Carole James told the legislature on Monday.</p>
<p>Said Campbell: "I will not make an assumption with regard to what has taken the time. I think it's important that we get the member back the information on why it has taken this time."</p>
<p>Campbell delivered a pro forma defence of B.C.'s unsatisfactory FOI system, saying every request costs taxpayers roughly $2,200 and that the average response winds up involving about 500 pages. So the process costs millions of dollars a year, he said.</p>
<p>B.C. finished last in a Canadian Newspaper Association cross-Canada audit of FOI compliance last month.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccine woes hampered H1N1 fight; Supply, demand never aligned, medical office says</b>
</div><div>Linda Nguyen and Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>735 words</div><div>3 June 2010</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Ontario received little co-ordination from the federal government on the delivery last year of the H1N1 flu vaccine, which meant supply-and-demand needs were never aligned, according to a report by the province's top doctor.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said Wednesday the province "did not receive good information" about how much vaccine was available and how much was going to be delivered to Ontario. This resulted in supply coming when demand for the vaccine was low and in shortages during the peak of the outbreak, culminating in long lineups at clinics and at doctors' offices, she said.</p>
<p>Last year's wave of the H1N1 flu spread quickly to more than 200 countries and led to the deaths of 17,700 people worldwide. In Canada, 426 deaths have been attributed to the outbreak that began in the spring of 2009.</p>
<p>Most of those deaths occurred in Ontario.</p>
<p>The report also found vaccination rates varied greatly across the country, ranging from 35 to 80 per cent of the population in some provinces. These rates also differed in Ontario cities, with Ottawa reporting the highest vaccination rate at 55 per cent.</p>
<p>Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's medical officer of health, credited Mayor Larry O'Brien and other municipal officials for offering the facilities and staff to run the city's mass vaccination clinics.</p>
<p>Levy also praised The Ottawa Hospital and Queensway-Carleton Hospital for boosting the number of people vaccinated at the clinics they ran, in addition to the ones offered by the public-health department.</p>
<p>"All of the (hospital) CEOs were on the phone to me in the first days of the vaccination campaign, asking, 'How can we help?'" Levy said. "And it made a big difference. They vaccinated about 40,000 people just in those clinics. We, in our community clinics, couldn't achieve those kinds of efficiencies."</p>
<p>King blamed the discrepancies in vaccination rates on Ontario's inability to electronically track medical records and said health officials may never know if the plan to immunize high priority groups, such as the elderly, young, the sick and pregnant women, brought down infection rates.</p>
<p>King also called on the Ontario government to clarify roles in managing future health emergencies for the 14 regional health authorities, known as Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs). Despite being key health-care funders and planners, the LHINs had no formal role during the H1N1 pandemic, resulting in some being more active than others, King said.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Cushman, chief executive of the Champlain LHIN, which covers much of Eastern Ontario, said he directed his office to act as a broker, connector and information clearing house for frontline doctors, hospitals, public-health units and other health responders during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Among other things, said Cushman, the Champlain LHIN:</p>
<p>- set up a social-networking site to allow doctors and nurses treating flu patients to share information and ask their colleagues for expert advice;</p>
<p>- eased pressure on hospitals by facilitating the creation of clinics at community health centres to assess and treat flu patients who didn't have family doctors or who couldn't get appointments quickly to see them;</p>
<p>- bolstered the ability of local public health units to vaccinate as many people as possible by mobilizing hospitals to run additional vaccination clinics.</p>
<p>More important, Eastern Ontario was one of the few regions with a detailed plan to cope with a potential surge in patients with life-threatening flu.</p>
<p>Under LHIN direction, Eastern Ontario's 18 hospitals not only tested common steps they should follow when faced with overcrowding in intensive-care units, but also acted as a regionwide ICU, with a rotation of physicians assuming the role of chief triage officer with authority to direct the sickest patients to the appropriate level of critical care.</p>
<p>"Our Ottawa experience, throughout, was very collegial, very collaborative," Levy said.</p>
<p>He went on to praise Cushman, who, as Ottawa's former medical officer of health, worked with Levy and others after the 2003 SARS epidemic to craft the pandemic response plan that was used during H1N1.</p>
<p>"We were lucky to have a public-health physician involved," Levy said.</p>
<p>Eleven Ottawa residents died from H1N1-related complications, and another 250 were hospitalized, with 50 of them requiring critical care.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Food safety drive failing, audit shows</b>
</div><div>Emma Reilly The Hamilton Spectator  </div>

</p>
<p>The city's public health department is failing to properly monitor Hamilton's restaurants.</p>
<p>An audit presented to council yesterday shows the city isn't meeting provincial standards for food safety inspections.</p>
<p>It should have performed 4,700 routine inspections last year, but missed that target by 1,200.</p>
<p>The audit also found restaurants and food services with repeat problems weren't consistently penalized. Out of 450 establishments with multiple infractions, only six were ticketed in 2009.</p>
<p>Ann Pekaruk, the city's director of audit services, said her department couldn't find an adequate reason why the inspections weren't completed.</p>
<p>"We questioned them on it, but they didn't have a definitive answer," she said.</p>
<p>City staff made 19 recommendations in yesterday's report to beef up the city's food safety measures for the city's 2,300 food establishments, including increasing the levels of enforcement, more specialized training for food inspectors and pursuing repeat offenders more aggressively.</p>
<p>Bob Hart, the environmental health manager with the city's public health department, says the majority of those 19 recommendations are already under way.</p>
<p>"This is a chance to move forward and make things even better," he said.</p>
<p>The province has varying levels of inspection standards for different food services.</p>
<p>High-risk establishments such as restaurants and nursing homes should be inspected three times a year because they make a wide range of foods with multiple preparation steps. Delis and takeouts are considered medium risk and should be inspected every six months. Convenience stores or stores that sell only prepackaged food are considered low-risk and only need to be inspected once a year.</p>
<p>In 2009, only 45 per cent of the high-risk establishments had all three required inspections. That's a 45 per cent drop from 2008, when 80 per cent of restaurants were inspected three times. Only 39 per cent of medium risk food services got both of their required inspections last year -- down from 86 per cent in 2008.</p>
<p>Hart acknowledges the numbers look "awful." However, he stressed that most restaurants were still inspected once or twice last year.</p>
<p>Hart also said that the 34 food safety inspectors are public health officers with a range of other duties -- including water, rabies, and housing inspections -- and last year, H1N1 took up staff time.</p>
<p>However, Pekaruk found that H1N1 "might have had some effect, but to us, it wasn't the determining factor."</p>
<p>As for the low number of tickets issued, Hart said it can often be "awkward" and "confrontational" for inspectors to issue tickets, and some prefer to take a more educational approach with food establishments that break the rules.</p>

<p>Retirement home bill rushed through: Critics</p>
<p>Opposition parties say legislation to regulate retirement homes was rushed through the House Tuesday without adequate consultation, leaving big loopholes harmful to seniors.</p>
<p>Critics charge the bill allows for self-regulation of the retirement home industry and it essentially creates the equivalent of long-term-care beds in the private sector. For years, advocates have called for the regulation of privately run retirement homes after horror stories of resident neglect, abuse and lax standards of care.</p>
<p>The legislation, which passed third reading Wednesday, creates a private oversight model over the industry called the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority, but some argue the body has limited public controls.</p>
<p>Challenge to <span class="companylink">Air France</span> settlement dismissed</p>
<p>The Ontario Court of Appeal has dismissed a challenge to a $12 million settlement for passengers injured in the 2005 crash of an <span class="companylink">Air France</span> jet at Pearson Airport.</p>
<p>A lawyer representing <span class="companylink">NAV Canada</span> argued Wednesday the air traffic control agency was prejudiced by the terms of the settlement, which prevent it from further cross-examining the first officer, who was flying the plane, and from questioning the pilot.</p>
<p>Last December, Justice Joan Lax of the Superior Court of Justice approved the settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of 184 passengers who were on board the plane that overshot the runway and burst into flames.</p>
<p>Supply-demand foul-ups hurt flu vaccine program</p>
<p>Ontario "fared pretty well" during its battle against the H1N1 virus but the province's top doctor is still launching a probe into why vaccine distribution problems led to long lineups.</p>
<p>Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Arlene King said there was a mismatch between vaccine supply and demand, which was largely out of Ontario's hands.</p>
<p>The federal government gave Ontario little warning about how much vaccine they'd receive and when, noted the report.</p>

<div>THE H1N1 PANDEMIC</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>The flu reality: Ottawa's mass immunization program failed; Health officials blame communication breakdown as new figures show shockingly low H1N1 vaccination rates, raising questions about Canada's pandemic planning</b>
</div><div>CAROLINE ALPHONSO   </div>
<div>1048 words</div><div>3 June 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- A $2-billion campaign to protect Canadians against an influenza pandemic failed dramatically in parts of Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta, newly obtained figures show, with one of the country's top doctors acknowledging that public health officials neglected to properly organize a mass immunization program.</p>
<p>Just over a third of residents in Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario were inoculated against H1N1, with a vaccination rate as low as one in four for residents of Hamilton, according to local health authorities. Quebec, the Atlantic provinces and the three territories, meanwhile, successfully inoculated more than half of their citizens. Newfoundland vaccinated about 70 per cent of its population.</p>
<p>Public health officials and medical experts, taking stock of the country's response to the pandemic, point to three reasons for the low vaccination rates: a failure to communicate the risks of the pandemic and the safety of the adjuvant; sequencing guidelines that gave priority to high-risk groups and were not followed by some provinces, confusing the public; and Ottawa's inability to fully inform provinces of the weekly vaccine supply, which stalled planning.</p>
<p>“The messaging was confusing, and the natural thing to do in a state of confusion is to go for the conservative option,” said Ross Upshur, director of the University of Toronto's Joint Centre for Bioethics and a primary-care physician.</p>
<p>Canadian health officials boasted about the years spent on pandemic planning, but the low vaccination rates in provinces west of Quebec point to huge gaps. Even though millions of dollars were spent on advertising the vaccine's effectiveness – $9.4-million in Ontario alone – and people lined up for hours at flu clinics in the early days of the rollout, the majority of the general public remained uninterested or wary.</p>
<p>Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Arlene King, estimated that about 38 per cent of Ontarians were vaccinated, which is at the low end of rates among provinces and territories. She has called for a review of the provincial immunization program, similar to the one taking place in Alberta.</p>
<p>“We underestimated the logistics of organizing and delivering a mass campaign in extraordinarily tight time-frames across a vast province, in the glare of intense media coverage and in the face of fluctuating demand,” Dr. King said Wednesday in releasing her assessment of H1N1. “We underestimated lineups and demand surges.”</p>
<p>Paradoxically, provinces where people seemingly clamoured loudest for the flu vaccine had the lowest vaccination rates. Public health officials say the main problem is that vaccine supply was inadequate when people wanted it, and was in surplus when demand dropped. Dr. King said there was little information coming from the federal government around vaccine supply. In one instance, she learned from a reporter how much vaccine Ontario would receive.</p>
<p>“We simply did not know from week to week how much vaccine we were going to get,” she said.</p>
<p>David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, argued that the federal government was in daily contact with provinces and territories. “We were watching it evolve in real time. They knew what we knew pretty much as we knew it,” he said in an interview Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dr. Butler-Jones said the federal government would not get involved in the delivery of vaccine, as that remains a provincial and territorial responsibility. He said governments are studying and trying to understand the regional variations in vaccination rates.</p>
<p>Health experts say the low rates point to failings on the part of provinces. Alberta, for example, initially ignored an agreed-upon priority list and said it would vaccinate anyone who showed up, forcing clinics to close abruptly. Ontario did the same, resulting in waits as long as six hours. Experts say confusion reigned, and the lack of co-ordination shook public confidence in how the pandemic was being handled.</p>
<p>What is more, anti-vaccine advocates or doctors expressed skepticism about the severity of the pandemic. As much as they tried, health officials, mainly in larger provinces, could not persuade the public to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>“In a small province you can control the message much easier than in a larger place where … you will always find a professor of something or a previous chief medical officer of health or someone else to say they disagree, the vaccine is not safe or the adjuvant is not properly tested or the pandemic is not so bad so why bother and so on,” said Paul Van Buynder, deputy chief medical officer of health in New Brunswick, a province that vaccinated 65 per cent of its population.</p>
<p>“I think it's very difficult to get 75 per cent of the public to go and do something if the message they're getting is actually a mixed message.”</p>

</p>
<p>Following is the viewpoint of the writer, president and CEO of the Saskatoon Health Region.</p>
<p>Two recent letters to the editor have perpetuated misinformation regarding the planning for the children's hospital.</p>
<p>On Jan. 11, 2006, the Saskatoon Health Region's service alignment steering committee, then chaired by Dr. Paul Hayes and Susan Bazelewski, made two recommendations to the Saskatoon Regional Health Authority and St. Paul's Hospital board of directors.</p>
<p>The first was to adopt the proposed service alignment model -- i.e. consolidation of most in-patient acute care services at two hospitals (St. Paul's Hospital and either Saskatoon City Hospital or the Royal University Hospital), and concentration of most ambulatory care and day surgery at the third site (either RUH or SCH). The second recommendation was to proceed with the next phase of planning, and further study the option of basing in-patient services at City Hospital.</p>
<p>These recommendations were informed by the Hay Group report and consultation with our clinical leaders. I and the senior leadership team supported both recommendations. The health authority and SPH board, too, approved both recommendations.</p>
<p>The next phase of planning, to further explore SCH as the site for in-patient services including maternal and child, involved further consultation with more than 150 physicians and staff, primarily regarding key co-locations among our adult and maternal and child services. As recommended by the Hay Group report, it also involved more detailed study of our buildings by external architects and engineers.</p>
<p>Based on this additional information, the service alignment steering committee in late 2007 recommended RUH, rather than City Hospital, as the preferred site to locate in-patient services, including maternal and child services. The committee recommended that SCH be the site of ambulatory care and day surgery.</p>
<p>Once again, I and the senior leadership team supported the committee's recommendations. The Saskatoon Regional Health Authority approved this recommendation and directed staff to proceed with the next phase of planning.</p>
<p>At no time did I personally "overrule" either the recommendations of the consultants we engaged or of the service alignment steering committee, which was mandated to develop recommendations for our authority and the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>Since the service alignment plan was approved in January 2006, many changes have been implemented regarding the location and delivery of hospital services in Saskatoon. These changes have resulted in increased efficiency, including fewer, not more, inter-hospital transfers, and less duplication of services and expensive equipment. The changes have enabled us to improve access to services.</p>
<p>Last year alone, we achieved a reduction of 53 per cent in patients waiting more than 18 months for surgery, and a reduction of 36 per cent in patients waiting longer than 12 months for surgery.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous year, we served 29 per cent more patients waiting for joint replacements (714 more hip and knee replacements) through implementation of a clinical pathway, increased operating room time, changes in clinical practice and access to improved technology at SCH, where these procedures are done.</p>
<p>We have also increased capacity for intensive care, which was so critical last year during the H1N1 pandemic. Improved access to intensive care has resulted in fewer surgical cancellations.</p>
<p>Reorganizing and improving our services have also enabled us to improve the safety of our care, as staff have standardized their practices, based on best available evidence. I am very proud of the enormous efforts and dedication of the hundreds of SHR staff and physicians involved in these changes.</p>
<p>Over the next two weeks, the children's hospital site validation advisory panel will review extensive information (including input from the public) prior to recommending the site. Our planning process, once again, has involved consultation with physicians and other clinical leaders and the University of Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>The panel includes members of our authority, the health region's medical staff and employees, the U of S, Ministry of Health, and members of the public, including a representative of our aboriginal community and the region's Maternal Child Family Advisory Council.</p>
<p>None of the panel members, including myself, have a personal agenda. We simply want to do the right thing for our community and the children and families of Saskatchewan, now and in the future. I encourage interested members of the public to access the website: http://chssitevalidation.wordpress.com[http://chssitevalidation.wordpress.com] for accurate information and more details regarding the history of this important project and the site validation process.</p>

<p>Ontario received little co-ordination from the federal government on the delivery of the H1N1 flu vaccine last year, resulting in supply-and-demand needs never being balanced, according to a report released Wednesday by the province's top doctor.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, said the province "did not receive good information" about how much vaccine was available and how much was going to be delivered to Ontario.</p>
<p>"There was never an alignment between H1N1 vaccine supply demand and our capacity to deliver it," she said at a news conference at Queen's Park. "The vaccine supply chain was out of our hands and, at times, so was the demand. However, the capacity to deliver an influenza vaccine fell squarely on the province."</p>
<p>Last year's wave of the H1N1 flu virus spread quickly to more than 200 countries and led to the deaths of 17,700 people worldwide. In Canada, a total of 426 deaths to date have been attributed to the outbreak, which began in the spring of 2009. The majority of the deaths occurred in Ontario.</p>
<p>When the federal government forced Ontario to wait on it for information, it left provincial health officials scrambling to make last-minute decisions about who should get priority for the Tamiflu vaccine, culminating in long lineups at public clinics and doctors' offices. Often, the province had more vaccine than it needed, and then found itself with a shortage during the peak of the outbreak, said King.</p>
<p>Ontario initially ordered 19 million doses of the flu vaccine, but eventually cut that order to 13 million. Only five million doses were eventually given out, and the majority of the vaccine has expired.</p>
<p>Health Minister Deb Matthews could not say how much the unused vaccine cost the province.</p>
<p>The report found that vaccination rates for H1N1 varied greatly across the country, ranging from 35 to 80 per cent of the population in some provinces.</p>
<p>These rates also differed in Ontario cities, with Ottawa reporting the highest vaccination rate at 55 per cent and Toronto the lowest at 35 per cent.</p>
<p>King blamed the discrepancies on the province's inability to track medical records, and said health officials may never know if the plan to immunize high-priority groups, such as the elderly, young, the sick and pregnant women did indeed bring down infection rates.</p>
<p>Windsor-Essex County Health Unit Medical Officer of Health Dr. Allen Heimann said despite the confusion and chaos in the first days of the H1N1 immunization program, "we fared better than many other places in the province."</p>
<p>Heimann said higher-than-expected demand for the vaccine at the onset and confusion about who met eligibility criteria were the biggest problems locally.</p>
<p>"Once we got that settled, the clinics were running quite well," Heimann said. "Everyone who wanted the vaccine was able to get it."</p>
<p>One of the lessons learned was that the overall directive from provincial authorities did not evenly apply to all health units because the communities they serve vary in size and population make-up, Heimann said.</p>
<p>"Different health units have different abilities," he said.</p>
<p>The local health unit distributed approximately 114,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine, Heimann said. This year, he expects the H1N1 shot will be rolled into the seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
<p>King made three key recommendations in the report, calling for the implementation of an electronic tracking system, a clearer "chain of command" from Ottawa and more power for the chief medical officer to standardize the distribution of vaccinations instead of relying on multiple public health units to make their own decisions.</p>

<div>809 words</div><div>2 June 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>The crime was easy to pull off, but not to get away with.</p>
<p>As hundreds of students at the University of Alberta slowly came forward to drop off their exams, one noticed a top student's finished paper on the pile. He grabbed it, erased both names and switched them.</p>
<p>Of course, when the grades came back, the top student took one look at his test and saw the handwriting wasn't his.</p>
<p>The cheater ended up in Deborah Eerkes's office.</p>
<p>She doesn't recall if there were tears. "We have so many that cry, it's de rigueur. When you end up in this office, you know it's bad," says the U of A's main disciplinarian.</p>
<p>She gave the cheater an F8 for the class, a fail with dishonour, and a two-year suspension from the university.</p>
<p>That case was one of more than a dozen to cross Eerkes's desk this year already, and she's prepared for more.</p>
<p>June is the busiest month. Between five and 10 new cases from exams and final papers will likely come to light in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>That's only the most serious cases. The institution has an average 225 cases of academic dishonesty a year among the 37,000 students on campus. Ten years after the institution launched an education campaign to curtail cheating and plagiarism in academia, fewer students argue they didn't know what they did was wrong.</p>
<p>But blatant cheating continues.</p>
<p>Many students say they panicked, didn't think through their actions. Some call it an "unconscious choice," says Eerkes. "To me, that's not plausible."</p>
<p>Eerkes has an easy laugh, wears sandals to work and sports a nose ring. But she also has the power to expel students.</p>
<p>She's joking when she calls the tiny, windowless room beside her office the "interrogation room," but also carries a panic button in case things get out of hand. She has never used it.</p>
<p>The room itself has four chairs, a round table and box of Kleenex. The painting on the wall is blue, "a calming colour," and the dull blue and red carpet on the floor deadens the echoes.</p>
<p>Eerkes's strategy is simply to lay all the evidence in front of the student, then listen. You can't assume the person is guilty, she says. "You have to be actually open to hearing what they have to say. Try and get them to respond to contradictions that you found in their stories. Really, really try to get them to talk, and listen (to them). There's a lot of listening.</p>
<p>"More often than not, they come clean at this office. It's hard to keep denying."</p>
<p>A student who disagrees with Eerkes's ruling can go before the University Appeal Board. Last year, only one did, and that appeal was denied.</p>
<p>Other tales of cheating this year include a student who lied on his application to get into a program and got through at least one semester before being found out. Eerkes gave him a two-year suspension.</p>
<p>Another student took quotes from Wikipedia, Coles Notes and other online sources, dropped them into her paper and didn't cite the work. But in that kind of case, "the writing style changes from paragraph to paragraph. It shines like neon," Eerkes says. It was the student's second time in trouble for the same offence. She also got a fail with dishonour and a suspension.</p>
<p>Eerkes has other, more bizarre, examples. One student plagiarized her own professor's work. Another student caught for plagiarizing gave the excuse: "Well, I didn't plagiarize. The student who wrote the assignment for me did." That earned him a suspension.</p>
<p>This year, several students lied about having H1N1 to get deferrals, but at least one got caught because a professor grew suspicious when the student only missed the most difficult exam.</p>
<p>Research shows students are more likely to cheat when they are going through major stresses outside school, such as divorce or a death in the family.</p>
<p>Eerkes says the current approach to education also plays a role. Education is valued less for its own sake and more for the degree at the end. "You just need that piece of paper to get a good job."</p>
<p>Cheat, and you are likely to get caught, she warns students. "Those of us who do this work around campus, our radar is up. Quite honestly, I think the chances of getting caught are fairly good."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Going after The Good Guys; Show updates cop buddies genre</b>
</div><div>Robert Philpot   </div>
<div>McClatchy-Tribune News</div>
<div>1524 words</div><div>2 June 2010</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>E6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>In a Fair Park building so anonymous that even the gate guards look at you quizzically when you ask about it, Colin Hanks is navigating his way through the police-station set of The Good Guys, the new Fox action-comedy that premiered Wednesday night.</p>
<p>It's early in the filming process, so early that when you ask Hanks what his favourite knickknack on set is, he says he doesn't know because it's his first day on the set. Which may make his walk through the set for a long, single-take shot a little tricky, but maybe not as tricky as it is for the camera people who are walking backward while shooting him.</p>
<p>Actor Tim Matheson, who's directing this episode, acknowledges a few days later that the walk-and-talk shot was influenced by Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme, with whom Matheson worked on The West Wing, but adds that he sees the style as going back to the work of Howard Hawks' romantic comedy His Girl Friday.</p>
<p>"Here, I think, I just wanted to take us through this place we've never seen before," Matheson says of the Hanks shot. "Without just overtly making it obvious, we go through this place, get comfortable with it, meet Colin's (character), see this space and then meet the boss."</p>
<p>This is fairly heady talk for The Good Guys, a show that involves, well, a lot of blowin' stuff up. It's not the office set that makes the show stand out, although there are Dallas police logos all over the place, as well as a Dallas swine flu advisory posted at several workstations, and a Dallas Public Safety Supply catalogue.</p>
<p>There are also desk calendars, some of which have notations you might not necessarily see on TV. One entry simply says, "Donuts, donuts, donuts, donuts, donuts ..." It's the kind of minutiae that set designers love, even if it might blow right by you while you're watching.</p>
<p>But North Texas viewers won't notice this interior so much as the landmarks that the show uses in its frequent exterior shots: Fair Park in general and the Cotton Bowl in particular; Reunion Tower; Deep Ellum streets and ..... well, OK, the "gentleman's club" is an interior shot, but there's still something about it that says "Dallas."</p>
<p>And the show adds another landmark to Dallas: Bradley Whitford's mustache.</p>
<p>Real-life counterparts In The Good Guys, Whitford plays Dan Stark, a washed-up, old-school detective still cruising on his hero status from having saved the life of the governor's son decades ago. Hanks plays his more straightlaced, by-the-book partner, Jack Bailey who, despite his principles, can still be seduced by Stark's risky methods of doing things.</p>
<p>The duo, especially Stark, has a way of attracting trouble that can turn seemingly small cases into big ones. For example, in Wednesday's "special preview" (the show begins its regular run June 7), the investigation of a stolen humidifier somehow got our heroes mixed up with a Mexican drug kingpin and two of the world's best assassins.</p>
<p>The show, created by Matt Nix (Burn Notice), has traces of Elmore Leonard novels, Robert Rodriguez action movies such as Desperado, and Pulp Fiction (one scene in the premiere is a near-direct quote) in its DNA. It's funny, fast-moving and over-the-top, with Matheson directing the premiere with panache, sending Whitford sliding across bartops with two guns blazing. But Whitford and Hanks learned from hanging out with real Dallas cops that as broad as their characters are, they have real-life counterparts.</p>
<p>"They were saying, 'I know guys exactly like (Whitford's character), and I know guys exactly like you,'" Hanks says. "'And they exist and they work together, and we make fun of them and they make fun of us.' In any profession, you'll find people that are kind of like those characters sometime. It's the exact same thing for cops watching this program as it is for people working in an office watching The Office."</p>
<p>Whitford gets a little more explicit.</p>
<p>"There's a certain kind of cop that is looked at with a sort of exhaustion by the other cops and a kind of envy by the other cops," Whitford says, using a term here represented by an ellipsis -- and then by Whitford's softened version of the term. "They're called ... Crap Magnets. Wherever they go, there's a phenomenal outburst of action. A lot of these guys are just anxious to get as much action as possible. That's why they became cops. Clearly, Dan is one of these guys."</p>
<p>For the role, Whitford grew what's commonly called a '70s cop-show mustache or, less genteelly, a porn-star mustache. It's actually relatively trim and neat; it's just not something you'd generally expect to see underneath the nose of Whitford, who's known for playing clean-cut intellectual sorts on shows such as The West Wing and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.</p>
<p>"My kids hate it," Whitford says good-naturedly. "I find it creeps out women. I think a beard is kind of reassuring. Women, when I'm dropping off my kids for school, will say in a kind of sympathetic way, 'Is that for a part?' Because they're hoping I haven't made the choice to just have a mustache."</p>
<p>Whitford says he even fights the makeup department on The Good Guys over the mustache: It wants to trim it. He wants to grow it out. He already has the Texan attitude that everything here is bigger.</p>
<p>Why set it in Dallas? So far, it sounds like The Good Guys could have been set anywhere, and in fact Nix says the show was originally set in Los Angeles. But he had a particular type of show in mind, and he says that Dallas gave it more of the classic cop-show look he was after.</p>
<p>"I feel like I grew up on shows that were unapologetic in their bad-assery," says Nix, who was born in 1971. "But you can't just 'do' Starsky and Hutch now. It doesn't work. People watch television differently. Things move much faster. Crime seems to be more sophisticated. The audience has moved on from those shows. And yet, I feel there's no reason to leave behind buddy cops who like each other and solve crimes in bad-ass ways."</p>
<p>It didn't hurt that one of those shows Nix references was also filmed in North Texas.</p>
<p>"The fact that Walker, Texas Ranger, was (shot) here was a major factor, because the people kind of 'get' this sort of show," Nix says. "But the other thing is that in doing a cop show that references the classic cop shows of old, the look of Dallas, with its old brick buildings, the fact that all the power lines are up in the air, the signage, the fact that downtown is visible from so many places around the city -- you can't buy that. There aren't many places that have that."</p>
<p>Nix proudly notes that although some Miami-set shows -- such as CSI: Miami and Miami Medical -- occasionally film in Miami but are mostly shot in Los Angeles, his USA series Burn Notice is the only one that continuously films there. He has learned that location filming has benefits that shooting in Los Angeles doesn't necessarily offer. That includes local actors, some of whom appeared in small parts in The Good Guys premiere.</p>
<p>"On Burn Notice, we've had great experience with doing the show in Miami," Nix says. "When you've got the home team kind of rooting for you, it makes a huge difference in what you're able to do. I don't want to be the guy who's coming to Dallas and not using local people. It's not just a place, it's a community. There are real benefits that accrue to me and the show in making use of local resources."</p>
<p>If you've seen Burn Notice, you also know that Nix likes car chases and blowing things up (on his Twitter feed, he said that the demolition of a helicopter in the Burn Notice season finale looked so realistic because the crew really blew up a helicopter). With Walker having shot in Dallas-Fort Worth, location scouts can tell him what he can get away with here.</p>
<p>"It was pointed out to me on a scout, it's like a five-storey parking garage we're driving by, and the guy in the van says, 'Oh yeah, we drove a car off that for Walker. Well, I immediately say, 'I will drive two cars off of that.'"</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 epidemic fuelled big jump in worker sick days</b>

<p>Part 2 of a two-part series on sick days taken by public-sector health and education workers. Today's stories include a look at how the H1N1 virus affected staffing levels and an examination of the cost of sick time to the two city school divisions.</p>
<p>Sick day data gathered from some public agencies in Saskatoon shows just how hard the autumn H1N1 outbreak hit workers and public services.</p>
<p>The Saskatoon Health Region's day-by-day breakdown of workers calling in sick shows absenteeism started hovering significantly above average every day during the last week of September 2009. Beginning on Sept. 28, at least 100 more workers than average were calling in sick every weekday until about Nov. 10. The numbers of sick calls coming in were unmatched by any other time in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 operating years, to date.</p>
<p>Depending on the day of the week, a typical day with high absenteeism for the region would see calls in the mid-to-high 700s (some health-care workers have every third Friday off, pushing Friday numbers much lower). During the H1N1 outbreak, the number of health region workers calling in sick was in the mid-800s on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The hardest-hit day appears to have been Oct. 28, when 909 region workers called in sick.</p>
<p>Absences at Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools began climbing during the first week of October. Although average sick calls range from about 79 to 86 teachers and support staff away each day, absenteeism was routinely hitting the 120 mark, starting on Oct. 26.</p>
<p>The hardest-hit day in Catholic schools was Nov. 3, when 152 school workers called in sick. Many more than 100 workers were calling in sick daily until Nov. 18.</p>
<p>Although requested in a freedom of information application, Saskatoon Public Schools did not provide any sick time data for the 2009-10 school year.</p>
<p>When asked for a daily breakdown of sick calls by civic workers, the City of Saskatoon asked for a fee of about $6,000 to compile the information.</p>

<div>EDITORIAL</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Wind power must be assessed in several ways</b>

<div>643 words</div><div>31 May 2010</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>The wait is over. Now, we've been officially told. In Ontario, wind turbines are not a health problem.</p>
<p>That's the word from Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health. Some people living within the vicinity of wind turbines have been reporting dizziness, headaches and sleep disturbance. The complaints prompted King's office to conduct a review of previously published studies mainly from abroad, and current legislation here.</p>
<p>When she put them together, she concluded Ontario's nearly 700 wind turbines are not making people sick.</p>
<p>"According to the scientific evidence, there isn't any direct causal link between wind turbine noise and adverse health effects," she said.</p>
<p>In a brief 14-page report issued this month - The Potential Impact of Wind Turbines - King explains legislation calls for wind turbines to have a 550-metre setback from residences, designed to keep noise levels at 40 decibels. That's described as somewhere around a normal conversation and a whisper, a quiet office or a library.</p>
<p>Looking at existing studies, she couldn't find compelling proof such levels are a problem.</p>
<p>But wind turbine opponents don't talk as much about volume as they do the constant low-frequency sound, likened to a swish or woof, which results from the turbine blades slicing through the air. King said the sound is not dangerous, but noted it "may annoy some people."</p>
<p>Indeed, those people aren't likely to give up, and shouldn't, considering a significant but largely ignored aspect of King's study. In her conclusion, she noted "a key data gap" exists in Ontario that is, a comparison of sound levels at residential areas around wind turbines versus other rural and urban areas. That could lead to an assessment of the actual ambient noise levels prevalent in Ontario.</p>
<p>King says such knowledge is vital before proceeding with what's called an epidemiological study, which looks more widely at the many factors affecting the health and illness of populations.</p>
<p>This broad approach is gaining increasing recognition with researchers at the University of Guelph, and elsewhere. You may have heard the emergence of what leaders in the field call "One Health." It acknowledges that the impact on health of practically anything is not isolated among species, and that something in the environment affecting humans can also affect animals and plants.</p>
<p>In other words, we live in one world, and share one health.</p>
<p>This was once called a holistic approach, and still is in many circles. But One Health sounds more familiar and it's starting to stick. It makes sense, as we become increasingly global, and as health-related concerns such as H1N1, for example, move quickly around the planet.</p>
<p>This emergence underlines the need for an increased emphasis on communicating about health, science, new technologies and issues that affect people broadly. Wind farms are a prime example. In isolation, they're a technology-driven, renewable energy source with the potential to contribute to the greening of Ontario. But what about their esthetics? And what about their affect on farm animals? Or what about using land to produce energy rather than crops and livestock? Those are hot buttons for people everywhere.</p>
<p>Science and society clash when technology is not well understood or presented. Research won't advance without public support. We need a measuring stick in society, something to guide us in decision making, and science is better than "trust me." Incorporating science into the decision-making process means the way forward is based on something other than emotion.</p>
<p>But it's important to recognize that while science is a vital part of the economy and indeed the future, its value is compromised unless people understand it and accept it.</p>
<p>Are we there yet with wind power? Not yet.</p>

<p>Shannon's short life was exceptional because of her attitude and her outlook, more than her condition. She was born with Osteogenisis Imperfecta, a genetic disorder characterized by very fragile bones. At birth, Shannon had 13 broken bones and there were many more in the years ahead. A mere startle could result in a broken arm, a brush against her pyjamas could break her leg. Though never able to walk, she zoomed through life making a lasting impression on everyone she met. Shannon was outgoing and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>A petite Grade 1 student at North Edwardsburg Public School, Shannon weighed only 14 pounds and wore size 24 months clothes, but there was nothing small about her personality. She was overjoyed to go to school and wanted to take part in activities her classmates pursued. Always busy, she joined Brownies and the Easter Seals Telethon as the Easter Seals Tammy representing Kemptville and area.</p>
<p>Despite her physical restrictions, trips to Ottawa Childrens' Treatment Centre, multiple admissions to CHEO and travel to Montreal to The Shriner's Hospital for intravenous treatments to increase bone density, Shannon lived the life of a typical kid. This was accomplished by parenting that gave her permission to strive beyond her capabilities, despite the risks, and have as much fun and independence as possible.</p>
<p>Grandparents Don and Lorraine Dobbie had daily involvement in Shannon's life; aunts and uncles were part of a huge support system. Having an older sister, Leigh, grounded Shannon in a relationship that deepened in love and friendship as the girls became young women. The birth of Shannon's nephew, Matthew, came at a time Shannon needed hope and she enjoyed being an aunt.</p>
<p>Her high school years were busy with dances and pool parties and summers in Smiths Falls at their campsite. Shannon graduated from South Grenville District High School as an Ontario Scholar. It was her plan to attend Carleton University this fall. Shannon dreamed of further independence, a career, finding that one special person -- all the things most of us aspire to.</p>
<p>Shannon expressed profound thoughts, even as a pre-schooler. The winter before she turned three was particularly difficult, with respiratory infections. One night in the pediatric intensive care unit at CHEO, struggling to breathe, heart and lungs failing, the family were told it was unlikely she would live through the night. One of several miracles in Shannon's life occurred that night and she unexpectedly improved. A week or so later, Shannon told her mom, "God put His hand on me and made me all better." She made us all believers of miracles.</p>
<p>Her philosophy developed from that early faith, to her own meaning of life as a teen. Pam Needham, tutor and friend, says: "Shannon lived life the way she wanted, and didn't let other people change her. She was nice, naughty, often a little bit morbid and sometimes a bit bizarre. She never wanted to be the centre of attention, but she often was."</p>
<p>She was a confidante and counsellor to many, always anxious to welcome someone new or help a friend put life in perspective. A poet and philosopher, Shannon reached out to others online and at school.</p>
<p>Shannon lived life to the fullest. Every person she ever met will remember Shannon Dobbie.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mexicans turn their backs on travel north; Canada aims at refugees</b>
</div><div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>511 words</div><div>30 May 2010</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>Dr. Esther Zurita was considering a trip to Canada to learn how to ski. Then the Canadian government imposed visa restrictions on Mexican travellers -- and the Mexico City physician had second thoughts.</p>
<p>"When it required so much paperwork and money, I immediately deleted it as a place to take a vacation," Zurita said.</p>
<p>As expected, Mexican President Felipe Calderon raised the visa issue while visiting Canada this past week, a reflection of the lingering discontent in Mexico over the sudden implementation of travel restrictions by a country that has become a popular tourism and study-abroad destination.</p>
<p>"It's [been considered] a kind of insult," said pollster Dan Lund, who studies Mexican social trends.</p>
<p>"Mexicans were very proud of their relationship, which didn't require a visa, and now it does."</p>
<p>For his part, Prime Minister Stephen Harper agreed with Calderon that Canada is paying a price for imposing visa requirements on Mexicans, but said there is no other interim way to halt "a torrent of bogus applications" for refugee status from Mexico-- at least until after a proposed new law is enacted.</p>
<p>The discontent in Mexico surfaced almost immediately after the rules were announced last July.</p>
<p>The Canadian Tourism Commission estimates a drop of 33 per cent in visits to Canada by Mexicans over the past year.</p>
<p>Jorge Morfin Stoopen, tourism commission director, says other factors besides the visa have diminished travel to Canada -- the H1N1 virus outbreak, a weak Mexican economy and a surging Canadian dollar. But he says the visa issue has been a deciding factor for many, since a five-year multiple-entry visa costs approximately $250 and many applicants describe the process as burdensome -- even though the rejection rate has been low.</p>
<p>"The economic impact [of the visa] on those in the Canadian tourism sector has been large," Stoopen said, adding that Mexican tourists are considered "high value," are known for going abroad to shop and spend an estimated average of more than $140 a day while travelling.</p>
<p>The impact on the education sector also has been significant. Canada had become a popular destination for Mexicans in search of everything from summer camps and English and French courses to full university degrees.</p>
<p>The discord over the visa issue threatens to unravel the work of nearly two decades of promotional efforts by Canadians in the fields of education, tourism and business that began when the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1993.</p>
<p>"Mexicans discovered that Canada wasn't the North Pole and Canadians discovered that South America didn't begin in Arkansas," said Guerra Castellanos, president of a prominent public relations firm here.</p>
<p>He attributed the seeming strain in relations to neglect and, in the case of the visas, "it was a problem of Mexico not seeing the flashing yellow lights that something was wrong" -- a reference to the spate of bogus refugee claims that prompted Canada to impose visa rules.</p>

</p>
<p>Terminal prissiness is astir in the land. All we can hope for is that scientists are working on a vaccine for it as diligently and quickly as they did for H1N1. We don't want this to become an epidemic.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario decided to ban Samichlaus, an Austrian beer. Samichlaus translates to a nickname for St. Nicholas in Swiss German and, therefore, this constitutes advertising liquor to children, which is taboo.</p>
<p>The logic here is stunning. Children overdose daily on video-game violence, profanity on prime-time TV, and none-too-subtle sexual innuendo in the hundreds of ads that inundate them -- yet, they risk being corrupted by the sight of a bottle of an obscure brand of beer with a picture of a Captain High-liner-type geezer on the label and a Swiss German name that means nothing to them.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, the little Canadian polyglots are boning up on Swiss German idioms in preparation for their next ski trip to the Alps.</p>
<p>If it's silly to ban something foreign whose name can't even be understood by the vast majority of individuals who supposedly need to be protected from it, then it's even sillier to ban something that's understood very well to be part of Canada's heritage. I'm referring to the kilt kerfuffle in Raymond.</p>
<p>Hamish Jacobs, 19, is so proud of his Scottish heritage that he wanted to wear a kilt to his high school graduation. But apparently, his school division had a policy about bare legs, and earlier, the word was that when they were apprised of Jacobs' plan, they feared worse things than legs might be bared at the ceremony, as Scotsmen are reputed to wear nothing under their kilts. Jacobs insisted he had no intention of indulging in any behaviour as tasteless as that.</p>
<p>Westwind School Division trustees are going to revisit their policy at a meeting next week, but they've bowed to public pressure in the interim and suspended it in Jacobs' case. Maybe while they're revisiting their policy, they could also complete a few homework assignments -- like reading up on Canadian history.</p>
<p>They could start by opening the Canadian Encyclopedia to the entry on the Scottish in Canada. It reads: "The connection between Scotland and Canada dates to the 17th century. The Scots have been immigrating in steady and substantial numbers for over 200 years. In the 2006 census a total of 4,709,850 Canadians, or 15 per cent of the population, listed themselves as of Scottish origin (single and multiple response). The kingdom of Scotland established one of the earliest colonies in Canada in 1621, when Sir William Alexander was granted a charter for Nova Scotia. Alexander established small settlements on Cape Breton and on the Bay of Fundy."</p>
<p>If that's too broad a reference, the trustees might want to remember that our first prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, was a Scottish immigrant.</p>
<p>Researching the matter a little closer to home, they'd learn that Col. James Macleod (born 1836 in Scotland, died 1894 in Calgary), came west to fight in the first Riel rebellion of 1870, and was later first assistant commissioner of the North West Mounted Police, whose forces marched west to quell the whisky trade in Alberta at Fort Whoop-Up, near Lethbridge. After unceremoniously punting Insp. Ephrem Brisebois back to Ottawa, Macleod scotched -- no pun intended -- the self-aggrandizing name of Fort Brisebois, which the inspector had chosen for the little outpost at the Bow and Elbow Rivers. Macleod renamed it Fort Calgary after a locale near his sister's home on the Isle of Mull. Calgary Castle stands there today, eight kilometres from the town of Dervaig. And our own Macleod Trail was named in honour of that eminent Scottish colonel, as was the town of Fort Macleod.</p>
<p>The trustees should also know that kilts are part of the uniform of numerous Canadian regiments, including the Calgary Highlanders, who wear the Argyll and Sutherland tartan kilt, the Seaforth Highlanders, who wear the Mackenzie tartan kilt, the Canadian Scottish Regiment, who dress in the Hunter Stewart tartan kilt, the 48th Highlanders, the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, the Nova Scotia Highlanders, the Lorne Scots, the Royal Highland Fusiliers, and the Black Watch, to name a few.</p>
<p>Ironic that it's OK for the members of these regiments to wear kilts and go off to fight and die for this country, but it wasn't OK for a Scottish kid in Alberta to wear a kilt to his high school graduation, although he would be allowed to change into it afterward.</p>
<p>When the controversy arose, the board hastened to say it wasn't trying to undermine Jacobs' Scottishness. Superintendent Doug Bennett told reporters the policy was established so kids wouldn't show up "in shorts or flip-flops."</p>
<p>Shorts and flip-flops do not have the same glorious historical import as kilts. Have you heard of anyone going to war in flip-flops? I haven't.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Low H1N1 vaccination rate alarms health experts; Finding ‘signals serious problems' in dealing with pandemics, raises questions about accuracy of immunization estimates</b>
</div><div>CARLY WEEKS   </div>
<div>532 words</div><div>28 May 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>The announcement that less than one-third of Torontonians received the H1N1 vaccine is taking health experts by surprise and creating alarm over potential system-wide deficiencies with the country's pandemic planning.</p>
<p>It's also raising questions over the lack of solid data on vaccination rates across the country and the accuracy of immunization estimates being used by some cities and provinces.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Toronto Public Health released a report that showed 28 per cent of Toronto residents received the H1N1 vaccine. That's far below national estimates from the Public Health Agency of Canada that indicate nearly half of the country's population received the shot. And it's lower than the 40 per cent that Ontario typically immunizes against seasonal flu.</p>
<p>“I'm surprised that it appears to be significantly lower than that,” said Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>As policy-makers and health experts evaluate the response to the H1N1 pandemic, Toronto's relatively low vaccination rate signals serious problems that need to be addressed across the system, said Earl Brown, professor in the biochemistry, microbiology and immunology department at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>Vaccine programs in Toronto and elsewhere were dogged by inconsistent communication from the government over the availability of the vaccine and who should receive it first, as well as problems with vaccine supply and the prominence of anti-vaccine advocates who spread myths about immunization risks, Prof. Brown said.</p>
<p>“When the experts start equivocating, then the public really had to throw up their hands sometimes,” he said.</p>
<p>Alberta's chief medical officer of health said the province immunized about 33 per cent of its population and agreed that missteps were made and that pandemic planning needs major improvements.</p>
<p>“Our view in Alberta is going to focus on what we can do better next time,” André Corriveau said, citing problems with communication, vaccine delivery and public perception of the risk from the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Although most cities and provinces haven't released official reports into the H1N1 pandemic, many have given estimates of H1N1 vaccination rates. B.C. said it administered vaccine to about 40 per cent of the general population. Quebec said it immunized nearly 60 per cent, while Saskatchewan has said more than half were vaccinated. A report from Ottawa Public Health estimated that more than half of the city's residents were immunized.</p>
<p>An official with Toronto Public Health said some of those estimates could change once comprehensive evaluations of the pandemic response are completed and made public.</p>
<p>Those reports could reveal that estimates being touted by some parts of the country have been exaggerated; for instance, estimates could include vaccine that was distributed, but never administered.</p>
<p>At this point, Toronto is one of the only areas in Canada to have released its full H1N1 report.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman with the Public Health Agency of Canada said it arrived at its estimate that 45 per cent of Canadians were vaccinated based on numbers provided by provinces and territories.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The swine flu pandemic that never was</b>
</div><div>Lorne Gunter   </div>

<div>760 words</div><div>28 May 2010</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>We owe experts our skepticism and common sense as much or more than we owe them our deference.</p>
<p>My colleagues on the National Post editorial board and I got into a debate by email on Wednesday over the fizzle that was the Great Swine Flu Pandemic of 2009-10. Like the never-was SARS pandemic and the didn't-happen bird-flu pandemic, swine flu -- or H1N1 -- was nowhere near the threat it had been hyped to be. It wasn't even the threat the regular seasonal flu is most winters.</p>
<p>Responding to statistics, released Tuesday, showing that just 28% of Torontonians bothered to get vaccinated against H1N1 (on average, 35% get a flu shot each winter) some of us (me included) were pushing for an editorial about how the whole swine-flu blitz was yet another example of expert-fed hysteria.</p>
<p>Others resisted an editorial, claiming the WHO, Health Canada, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and similar agencies around the globe had used their best professional judgment to try to keep the rest of us safe from what may well have been a deadly infection. It would be unfair to blame them in hindsight just because their well-intentioned predictions turned out to be spectacularly wrong. None of us have PhDs in epidemiology, a colleague pointed out. Who are we to second guess the conclusions of those who do and who have studied infectious disease control?</p>
<p>But none of us are members of the Privy Council, either, yet we second-guess Cabinet ministers all the time, even though they are experts in political intrigue and we merely informed observers. We aren't meteorologists, yet we second-guess the weather forecast. Nor are we doctors, but we often ask for second opinions.</p>
<p>Why? Because it is healthy to challenge--up to a point.</p>
<p>It would be wrong to dismiss all expert advice out-of-hand, to scorn anything and everything that comes from scientists or officials as impractical, effete or politically biased. That would be anti-intellectual. Besides, science -- good, solid, objective (as far as it is possible for humans to be objective) science--has been one of mankind's greatest boons. But it is equally wrong to accept any expert advice without questioning it. The majority of scientists were wrong about the universe, until they became Copernicans, wrong about germs until the majority became Pasteurians and wrong about evolution until they became Darwinians.</p>
<p>Also, in the case of H1N1, it's not as though there were no critics of the WHO, CDC and Health Canada. From the start of this pandemic scare, a little more than a year ago, there were skeptics who warned against precisely the kind of overreaction that occurred.</p>
<p>According to the web-site flucount.org,there were 25,000 deaths from H1N1 worldwide, while according to the World Health Organization (WHO) there were just 18,000. Moreover, the WHO number is a bit of an artifice. It is based on the fact that 10,000 deaths are confirmed, while another 8,000 deaths are merely assumed, based on an extrapolation from the known fatalities. Whichever number is correct, the point is that H1N1 killed far, far fewer people than predicted. It even killed far fewer than the typical season flu, which the WHO reports causes 250,000 to 500,000 deaths annually around the globe. These numbers are really bad news if you are among the 18,000 to 25,000 people who succumbed to swine flu. But in a general sense, the H1N1 infection and death rates were good news. There was no repeat of the very deadly swine flu outbreak of 1918-19 or even the lesser known one in the late 1950s.</p>
<p>Health Canada planned for 15% to 35% of Canadians to contract swine flu and 34,000 to 138,000 to be hospitalized. These latter figures would have overwhelmed our health care system. Thousands of those infected were expected to die.</p>
<p>But instead of 35% of us coming down with swine flu, or even 15%, in the end less the one-tenth of 1% of the population got the disease and just one in 60 of those infected died as a result.</p>
<p>Even very well-educated people are susceptible to group-think, including public-health experts. They become so focused on their forests, they are unable to see its trees. Then, their personal agendas may begin driving their critical thinking.</p>

</p>
<p>For a government that prides itself on getting out of the way of business, the Conservatives have done a heck of a job of getting in the way.</p>
<p>New tourism numbers from Statistics Canada released yesterday show that the number of Mexicans who visited Canada fell 60% in the fourth quarter of last year. Mexico used to be the sixth-biggest source of tourists, but has now slipped out of the top 10, costing the country $130-million in lost revenue. That doesn't even tell the whole story -- tourism numbers were already down in the first half of last year thanks to the economic crisis and H1N1, but fell off a cliff once the government required all Mexican visitors to have a visa to enter Canada. The number of nights spent in Canada by Mexicans fell 29% to 3.6 million last year, and 2010 promises to be worse still.</p>
<p>Figures from Mexico's NAFTA office in Canada suggest the trading relationship between the two countries has taken a real hit, too -- falling 17% to $21.7-billion in the 12 months to the end of 2009. How much of this was due to the visa requirement is hard to say, but demanding Mexican businessmen and women hand over their passports to the Canadian embassy for two weeks in order to receive a visa clearly didn't help the trading relationship (the Canadian government has only recently introduced a fast-track visa process for business travellers.)</p>
<p>The visa-requirement decision was taken with the best of intentions by Immigration Minister Jason Kenney, who was concerned about the soaring number of refugee claimants from Mexico. The number tripled to 9,400, 90% of which were rejected as bogus. Mr. Kenney said in an interview that Mexico violated its exemption criteria in 2007 and it would have been "grossly irresponsible" not to have introduced visa requirements, which he said will save taxpayers $400-million.</p>
<p>The visa requirement succeeded in choking off the torrent of bogus claimants, but it was such a blunt instrument that the law of unintended consequences kicked in.</p>
<p>Not only was tourism and business revenue hit but the way the decision was communicated to the Mexicans caused grave offence to a partner with whom we have a larger trading relationship than France, Germany or the rest of Latin America combined.</p>
<p>President Felipe Calderon, who was in Ottawa yesterday, was told of the decision by Stephen Harper last May when he called the Prime Minister to thank Canada for the help it offered to Mexico during the swine flu crisis. Perhaps Mr. Harper thought it incumbent upon him to personally deliver the news to the Mexican President, but the lack of prior notice or consultation chilled what had been a warm relationship between two men. It was "like bucket of cold water" that was "very, very badly received in Mexico," said one official.</p>
<p>There were signs of a thaw yesterday and Mr. Calderon was in a magnanimous mood when he addressed the Canadian Parliament. He said he appreciated that the Harper government had introduced visas because some Mexicans were "abusing the generosity of the Canadian people" and "perverting the noble aims of the asylum system to their own ends."</p>
<p>But he said he regretted the decision and urged swift passage of the government's proposed way out of the visa mess that even Mr. Harper admitted yesterday is "not an ideal solution."</p>
<p>The government is hoping to get Liberal support for a refugee reform package before the summer recess, but it will take at least a year before the new system becomes operational. Mr. Kenney's hope is that by reducing the number of avenues for appeal for claimants from democratic countries, it will change the calculus of bogus refugees who can currently plan on spending four to five years in Canada having their appeals heard.</p>
<p>Countries deemed "safe," according to their human-rights and rule-of-law records, will have an advantage in securing a visa exemption. Mr. Calderon went to considerable lengths yesterday to persuade Canadian parliamentarians that Mexico deserves "safe" status for its courageous fight against the drug cartels. Mr. Kenney said he agreed that Mexico is a democracy that believes in the rule of law and protects human rights, "but that is not to predetermine whether Mexico will be a designated 'safe' country." He said an independent panel will make that decision.</p>
<p>Mr. Kenney's solution seems reasonable -- though, once again, it should be judged by its results, rather than its intentions. In fact, it is so sensible one wonders why it wasn't proposed a year ago -- before Canada lost hundreds of millions in tourism dollars and offended a friend and ally.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Only 28 per cent of Torontonians got H1N1 shot, study shows</b>

</p>
<p>After governments spent millions to advertise and roll out the H1N1 vaccine, only 28 per cent of Torontonians rolled up their sleeves, a new report from Toronto Public Health shows.</p>
<p>The figure includes Toronto residents who got the shot from health units outside the city and excludes non-residents who got it in Toronto.</p>
<p>It also mirrors the result of a poll taken by public health that ended Jan. 3, 2010, in which 30 per cent of 416 residents said they had gotten the shot, and 3 per cent they definitely planned to get it, says the report, which will be presented before the Toronto Board of Health next week.</p>
<p>While seemingly low, 30 per cent is about average across the country, said Michael Gardam, director of infectious diseases at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion.</p>
<p>There were many reasons why people did not race to get the H1N1 shot, he said, save for the one- to two-week surge of interest after an Ontario child died of the virus.</p>
<p>Much of the disease was spread in the spring before the vaccine became available, so people might have thought they'd already had it, he said. And when the vaccine became available, people were seeing news media reports that the worst was over.</p>
<p>Still, he acknowledged, “Toronto definitely got harder hit in the first wave than the rest of the country.”</p>
<p>In total, about 750,000 vaccinations were given out across the city with about 30 per cent of those in public-health clinics, the report said. The rest were delivered in hospitals and doctors offices. A September, 2009, report from Ontario Chief Medical Officer of Health David Butler-Jones said Ontario would have enough vaccine for 75 per cent of the population to receive two doses.</p>
<p>Last fall's H1N1 flu response was the biggest vaccination campaign Toronto Public Health has ever undertaken, the report said.</p>
<p>“It's a pretty big logistical nightmare to roll this out. They'd also been on strike the first weeks before this, and lost about six weeks of planning time,” Dr. Gardam said. “Despite that, over all, the vaccine rolled out well once people figured out what vaccine they were supposed to get.”</p>

<p>Kyle Parrish has a quarterback's number but a special teamer's heart, much like a former B.C. Lions starter who began as a fourth-stringer five years ago.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether Parrish, whose signing was announced Wednesday by the Lions, has the upside to become another uncut gem like Buck Pierce was for the Canadian Football League team. But the rookie QB shares more with Pierce than just a California birthplace. Parrish appears to want to play the game so badly that no amount of rough handling can deter him.</p>
<p>Last season, his final of two at Division II Ferris State University, Parrish was affected by the same problematic AC joint (shoulder) injury that sidelined the plucky Pierce in his final season with the Lions. Parrish also battled through the H1N1 virus, the first recorded case of the swine flu knocking out a Ferris State player in Jeff Pierce's 25 years as the Bulldogs head coach. Parrish started, a day after being given medical clearance, because of an injury to the Dogs' other quarterback.</p>
<p>"Talk about toughness," Pierce said Wednesday. "That's never an issue with him. His passion to play the game of football is very strong. He's willing to go the extra mile."</p>
<p>Parrish proved that by leaving Southern California for Ferris State, in Central Michigan, after leapfrogging through a succession of junior colleges in the Los Angeles area trying to find the right fit for football. He went from Golden West to Orange Coast and finally to Compton Community College, forsaking the crime and prison-yard environment of Compton for the chance to be a No. 1 quarterback. Conditions were so bad at Compton that Saturday practices became mandatory. There were no lights to illuminate the field for late after-school workouts.</p>
<p>"Compton was insane," says Tom Maher, who was Parrish's offensive coordinator for his first season there.</p>
<p>"It was kind of the bottom of junior colleges in California. But, in my view, Kyle had more guts than a slaughterhouse. We had pass protection issues and he got annihilated. They'd blast him, and he'd just keep getting up and playing hard. You want a tough kid, he's your guy. He'll bust his hump to play."</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, when asked to assess his dominant quality as a quarterback, Parrish replies: "My toughness, No. 1. And also my ability to throw the football."</p>
<p>That's good because, going into training camp with Casey Printers as the starter, another veteran, Jarious Jackson, as his backup, and second-year man Travis Lulay as No. 3, Parrish will have to show some throwing ability in a hurry to stick around.</p>
<p>The 6-1, 190-pound quarterback turns 24 on Saturday, the day he arrives in Vancouver to get ready for rookie camp, opening next Wednesday in Kamloops. The defensive line coach at Ferris State -- Whitney Bell, a self-admitted Todd Bertuzzi fan who spent two seasons on the Lions practice roster (2006-07) -- has given him an idea about what to expect.</p>
<p>"He and I get along well, but I give Whitney a hard time about being a hockey fan," Parrish says. "He loves hockey."</p>
<p>Ferris State, in fact, is known more for its hockey prowess (the only sport in which the Bulldogs compete at the NCAA Division I level) than its football. NHLers Jason Blake and Chris Kunitz are among the school's alums.</p>
<p>Retired Montreal Alouettes defensive lineman Ed Philion and former Lions receiver Clarence (Choo Choo) Coleman, however, are other Bulldogs who have gone on to careers in the CFL. Philion's stay was long; Coleman's was short.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Only 28% of residents got H1N1 shot H1N1 quick facts; City health report finds vaccine arrived too late, just as flu infection rate peaked in October 2009</b>
</div><div>Theresa Boyle  Toronto Star    </div>

</p>
<p>Only 28 per cent of Torontonians received the H1N1 vaccine, far below the 75 per cent targeted by the province.</p>
<p>A report to be presented to the city's board of health next Tuesday states that the estimated vaccination rate of Toronto residents was 28.2 per cent. And it confirms what many have long suspected - that the vaccine arrived too late.</p>
<p>The report, essentially a post-mortem on how the pandemic was managed, outlines lessons learned that can inform pandemic and emergency planning in the future.</p>
<p>While the city's response was a success in many ways, "things can always be done better," said Dr. Barbara Yaffe, the report's lead author and director of communicable disease control for public health.</p>
<p>The public health unit was stymied by changing directives from the provincial health ministry, the report states. For example, the initial plan stated that only public health units administer the vaccine. That was later expanded to include physicians and hospitals.</p>
<p>The report calls on the ministry to review options for efficient vaccine delivery and to clarify criteria for decision-making during an influenza pandemic. It notes that the roles and responsibilities were unclear for the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion and the province's 14 local health integration networks, which coordinate local health services and funding.</p>
<p>Asked about the 28 per cent rate, Yaffe said: "Obviously I would have liked to have seen it higher, but I think that given all the challenges that we faced, it wasn't bad."</p>
<p>The health ministry has said an estimated 38 per cent of Ontarians were vaccinated. Yaffe said she couldn't explain the discrepancy. Noting the numbers were only "estimates," she said only about 70 per cent of family physicians who administered the vaccine submitted regular reports on vaccine uptake.</p>
<p>Yaffe said she was disappointed by the low vaccination rate among health care workers. Only 39 per cent of employees in long-term care settings got the shot, 58 per cent in acute care settings such as hospitals, and 59 per cent in complex continuing care facilities.</p>
<p>Last year, the health board urged the province to make flu shots mandatory for health care workers if coverage rates don't increase.</p>
<p>The report found that most of the serious illness from the virus occurred before significant immunity from the vaccination was achieved.</p>
<p>"In retrospect, the vaccine came too late," Yaffe said.</p>
<p>The peak of the infection in the second wave occurred at the end of October, just as vaccine was made available to priority populations. It took up to two weeks for it to become effective after administered.</p>
<p>Another challenge facing public health was the "lack of robust surveillance systems" that would identify how many people were ill in "real time," the report said.</p>
<p>More than 750,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine were administered in Toronto.</p>
<p>Fewer than 50 per cent of physicians surveyed by Toronto Public Health felt the vaccine-ordering process went well. Frequently cited concerns included vaccine delays, excess red tape, wastage due to large shipments of the vaccine.</p>
<p>There were 30 deaths associated with the H1N1 virus in Toronto and 428 in Canada.</p>
<p>Source: Toronto Public Health</p>
<p>After the vaccine was given, it took up to two weeks to become effective.

</p>
<p>Too many front-line health-care workers are failing to protect themselves against the flu despite last year's H1N1 pandemic, strong scientific evidence showing the effectiveness of vaccines, and their own increased risk of falling ill through close contact with the sick.</p>
<p>A new Toronto board of health report shows that 59 per cent of hospital workers received the H1N1 vaccine, a rate comparable to that of seasonal influenza shots in previous years. But the vaccination rate was lower - just 39 per cent - for staff in long-term care homes, where elderly patients are at high risk of catching the flu. Both fall short of provincial guidelines, which call for 70 per cent of health-care workers to be immunized against influenza.</p>
<p>More troubling than those broad numbers is a shocking variance among institutions. Among acute care hospitals, for example, Toronto's University Health Network had 99 per cent of its staff immunized against H1N1 compared to just 40 per cent at Rouge Valley Centenary Hospital. The gap was even more striking for long-term care homes, with some facilities showing 100 per cent of staff receiving an H1N1 shot and others with zero.</p>
<p>In 2009, the board of health urged Queen's Park to consider making flu shots mandatory for health-care workers if immunization rates didn't significantly improve over three years. This latest data inspire no confidence that workers are getting the message.</p>

<p>Less than 29% of Torontonians got the H1N1 vaccine -- and fewer than 60% of health-care workers were immunized -- during the mass immunization campaign of 2009 and 2010, Toronto Public Health says. The statistics were revealed in a report that also suggested ways the province could improve its response to the next pandemic. Top of mind for Dr. Barbara Yaffe, director of communicable disease control at Toronto Public Health, was the lack of real-time data on flu cases. She said that while hospitals had to report confirmed cases, there was patchy information about flu-related check-ins at emergency rooms. "It was a challenge to figure out what was going on, particularly in primary care," she said. The estimated vaccination rate for Torontonians was 28.2%, which Dr. Yaffe said was "not bad" considering about 35% of people get the regular flu shot. She was disappointed however, with the rate among health-care workers.</p>

</p>
<p>The Vancouver Island Health Authority plans 10 needle exchange facilities on Vancouver Island, four in Victoria suburbs, by year's end.</p>
<p>We learned the 10 needle exchange facilities will offer minimal services and probably not attract any new clients. They will provide addiction counselling or extended health care monitoring of injection drug users.</p>
<p>We learned that exchange programs already operate at many "fixed sites" such as health centres and pharmacies, although they lack any of the services commonly associated with a needle exchange.</p>
<p>And that VIHA is committed to harm reduction principles of making clean needles and crack-smoking supplies available to drug users, even if those principles have not yet translated into action.</p>
<p>Data showed that borrowing used needles has fallen by half over the last four years, although no data showed how many former injection users had switched to inhalation use because of the shortage of clean needles.</p>
<p>Representatives from other municipalities have already started NIMBY campaigns.</p>
<p>The people afflicted with drug addiction might come from all strata of society and have gravitated to the urban core where drugs are sold, but Saanich's Frank Leonard, Esquimalt's Barb Desjardins and Langford's Denise Blackwell have already expressed "concerns."</p>
<p>We have municipalities once more attempting to dictate how VIHA handle a public health crisis that causes more deaths than the H1N1 or SARS ever did.</p>
<p>The truth is that it is all our neighbourhood and these are all our citizens -- someone's brother or sister or child. Every study shows needle exchanges will save enormous amounts of tax money. Act out of basic compassion; the financial and human benefits will follow.</p>

</p>
<p>Saskatchewan farmers, bolstered by good crops and lower expenses, reaped a bigger net farm income in 2009, even as the national figure edged downward.</p>
<p>However, new statistics for the first quarter of 2010 suggest there are clouds on the horizon.</p>
<p>Realized net farm income in the province grew from $1.6 billion in 2008 to $1.9 billion last year, according to a Statistics Canada report released Tuesday.</p>
<p>The better bottom line in Saskatchewan was in part due to a 6.6-per-cent decline in farm expenses such as machinery, fuel and fertilizer in 2009, after the province's farmers weathered a 13.5-per-cent spike in expenses the previous year, the report found.</p>
<p>On a national scale, realized net farm income -- the difference between a farmer's cash receipts and operating expenses, minus depreciation plus income in kind -- dropped by $10 million, or less than one per cent, to $3.6 billion.</p>
<p>The revenue from crops increased about four per cent in Saskatchewan in 2009 and grew less than one per cent nationally as a drop in prices was offset by an increase in the quantities sold, Statistics Canada reported.</p>
<p>"(2009) was a pretty solid year and that was a result of pretty fair commodity prices and large production numbers," said Greg Marshall, president of the Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan, adding the province fared well compared to some other provinces due to its diverse mix of crops.</p>
<p>But Marshall said the report also highlights the ongoing challenges in the livestock sector.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan livestock receipts were down 15 per cent in 2009, and dropped almost five per cent nationally, due to a "sharp decline" in the number of animals exported as new food labelling legislation came into effect in the United States. There was also less demand for meat products due to the global recession, the report said. Marshall said cattle and hog prices have shown some improvement in recent weeks, but producers "have had some serious losses in the past they've got to be able to recover from that."</p>
<p>Saskatoon agricultural economist Richard Gray said Saskatchewan's large grains and oilseeds sector was the big reason the province accounted for more than half the national realized net farm income.</p>
<p>"We're the dominant grain producer ... The prices were off a little bit but they were still pretty good," Gray said.</p>
<p>"Livestock was under some pressure," he said, citing high feed grain prices and fallout from the H1N1 flu outbreak being dubbed swine flu as some of the challenges.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, data for the first quarter of 2010 also released Tuesday shows revenue farmers are getting for livestock and crops has fallen from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Farm cash receipts, which also include the money farmers get from program payments, are down 14 per cent in Saskatchewan in the first quarter. Nationally, receipts are down 12.3 per cent compared to the same time period in 2008.</p>
<p>"The slide in grain and oilseed prices has persisted since they peaked in 2008, as world grain and oilseed supplies continued to grow," Statistics Canada reported.</p>
<p>"On the livestock side, both the number of animals sold and the prices received for cattle and hogs were lower."</p>
<p>An Agriculture Canada forecast released earlier this spring projected that realized net farm income could decline 55 per cent in Saskatchewan in 2010 to $980 million and national net farm income could drop 90 per cent from 2008.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ontario's farm sector ringing alarm bells</b>
</div><div>Owen Roberts   </div>
<div>642 words</div><div>25 May 2010</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>The optimism that normally surrounds planting season is mired in a troubling forecast about Ontario farm income.</p>
<p>As farmers put their 2010 crops in the ground, Ottawa is predicting they could lose as much as $500 million when they harvest in a few months.</p>
<p>Granted, that's the worst case scenario. But even the best case scenario has them deep in the hole. It could easily be one of the worst years ever for Ontario farmers.</p>
<p>The situation is dire. And make no mistake, it will not fix itself.</p>
<p>Farm groups such as the Ontario Federation of Agriculture are trying to sound the alarm bell and drum up support for relief from what federation president Bette Jean Crews calls a crisis.</p>
<p>"It's not farmers' fault, it's not the government's fault, it's a combination of factors that made for a perfect storm," she says. "Government programs exist that will get us through one crisis, but not a multitude of crises all at the same time. The numbers are staggering and we need help."</p>
<p>This perfect storm has been brewing for a long time. As far back as 30 years ago, grain wars between the U.S. and Europe set the global grain price unreasonably low. Americans and Europeans sold at rock-bottom prices just to move grain, and subsidized their producers to make up for shortfalls. That meant other exporting nations such as Canada had to do the same. Prices for farmers have been chronically low ever since.</p>
<p>More recently, in 2003, BSE resulted in closed borders to the United States for beef, and permanent damage ensued in the farm sector. The bad luck continued when H1N1 sent the pork industry into a nose dive. At about the same time, the U.S. instituted stringent and costly point-of-origin labelling laws, making it tougher to export there. Then, the world recession hit, followed most lately by late frost and floods. Add in high fuel and fertilizer costs, and the situation is unbearable.</p>
<p>Crews says farmers need a short-term fix, as well as a long-term insurance program (something they dub a stability program) to re-balance their world. She's taking that sustainability message up to Ottawa.</p>
<p>Crews believes the province supports long-term prospects for farming, and says both Ontario's premier and its agriculture, food and rural affairs minister stands behind farmers' goal of having long-term insurance.</p>
<p>For its part, the federal government has come through with significant funding initiatives for research, and sector development projects. However, nationally, Crews says farmers in other provinces are in trouble too, and overall they need a $1 billion emergency payment "until we can get a long-term fix."</p>
<p>That said, Crews believes the ultimate long-term fix is consumer support. She says farmers' outlook would improve dramatically if consumers chose Ontario products that could be priced fairly, reflecting all the costs of production.</p>
<p>Instead, consumers typically choose the low-priced alternative. On the plus side, support is growing for local food. But it needs to happen at more than farmers' markets, more than during a stop at a roadside stand, and more than when field crops and orchards are ripe. It needs to become a part of our culture.</p>
<p>Says Crews: "Consumers can choose what they want either food they can trust from Ontario farmers, or imported food. Most countries understand the need to have a sovereign food supply. We're not nearly concerned enough about that."</p>
<p>Take a look at what happened to our manufacturing sector when we chose low-cost alternatives. The same thing could happen to food and farming. And it will be at our peril.</p>

<p>At the presentation of the Clarence Campbell Trophy after the Chicago Blackhawks secured their first trip to the Stanley Cup Finals since 1992, captain Jonathan Toews avoided the hardware like it was contaminated with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"Caught my eye there. Kind of shiny. Didn't need to touch it, pick it up," he said with a grin. "They gave us hats, so we go home with those and be happy with that."</p>
<p>Keeping his distance from the NHL Western Conference championship award has nothing to do with any superstition about touching the second-most coveted trophy in the NHL, he insisted.</p>
<p>"It's just saying we're here for bigger and better things," he said.</p>
<p>With their 4-2 victory to complete a sweep of the San Jose Sharks, the top-seeded Western team, the Blackhawks established themselves as favourites to win their first Stanley Cup since 1961. They've been to the Finals five times in the interim.</p>
<p>Chicago will have home-ice advantage when it faces the Philadelphia Flyers in the best-of-seven Stanley Cup final, which starts Saturday.</p>
<p>The trip to the final caps a remarkable resurgence for the Original Six franchise, which had managed one playoff appearance since 1997 before reaching the conference final last season.</p>
<p>Sunday, the Blackhawks overcame a 2-0 deficit with four goals in the final 27 minutes. Forward Dustin Byfuglien continued his playoff heroics, knocking in the go-ahead goal from in front of the net on a feed from Patrick Kane with five minutes, 55 seconds remaining.</p>

<p>Dr. Howard Ovens walks so briskly that it's hard to keep up with him. He's an emergency-department doctor, and speed matters.</p>
<p>But if you're waiting in ER, speed doesn't seem to matter. When I took my mom to the hospital a couple of weeks ago, she waited 10 hours to see a doctor. After 17 hours, the doctor decided to admit her. In all, it took more than a day to get her from her bed to a hospital bed. She wasn't in any danger. But it's hard, and her experience is far from uncommon.</p>
<p>Dr. Ovens is passionately determined to change that. He's head of emergency at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, and he's also one leader of an ambitious three-year project that's tackling ER gridlock across Ontario. The stakes are high. “If people think the emergency problem is unsolvable, then they won't touch it for years to come.”</p>
<p>The primary problem in ER is not that too many people are showing up with the sniffles. The problem is that truly sick people wait too long to see a doctor and get a hospital bed. That leads to overcrowding, back-ups and sometimes tragedies, to say nothing of headlines that are highly embarrassing to politicians. Politicians are extremely eager to fix ER wait times.</p>
<p>So what's the key to busting up the ER gridlock? Think like people who work in manufacturing. Measure everything. Gather data. Set standardized performance targets. Align people and systems with incentives. Analyze the data. Make the data public so that every hospital can see how it's doing compared to others. “People and systems respond rationally to incentives,” says Dr. Ovens.</p>
<p>At the heart of Mount Sinai's emergency department is a big electronic display board that registers the status of each patient and the time remaining to meet the wait-time target. For example, the standardized target for treating simple cases (a broken arm, an earache) is four hours from the time the patient arrives until the time she goes home. For complex cases, it's eight hours. The staff can look at the digital board and see at a glance that in order to meet the target, they have 57 minutes left to finish treating Ms. X. All the performance stats are constantly updated and available by computer. This year, every hospital in Ontario is expected to discharge 80 per cent of the complex cases it sees in emergency within eight hours. Mount Sinai is currently achieving 85 per cent. The hardest nut to crack is wait times for people like my mom, who need a hospital bed. But beds are hard to find, so big urban hospitals are way behind on that one.</p>
<p>Last year Mount Sinai got an $800,000 incentive bonus from the government for improving its emergency department performance. The money went for extra staff and beds. There are intangible rewards as well – such as improved staff morale and fewer surly patients. “The greatest reward for staff is a better professional working environment,” Dr. Ovens says.</p>
<p>The notorious problem with ambulance offloading has been fixed, too. Paramedics used to hang around for hours (frequently on overtime) waiting to turn their human cargo over to the hospitals. Hospitals were punished for success, because the faster they treated ambulance cases, the more ambulances would pour in. Now there's a dedicated nurse assigned to ambulance cases, who can take them over right away. All hospitals are obliged to share the ambulance load. At Mount Sinai, the turnaround time for ambulances is down to 18 minutes.</p>
<p>Then there's the dog that didn't bark. Last fall, emergency departments across the province were hit with record volumes during the H1N1 epidemic. They handled it. No bad-news headlines. Proof, says Dr. Ovens, that the system is markedly improving. The biggest enemy of progress is fatalism, he argues. “If we're fatalistic, we let the system off the hook.” Then he says goodbye and strides away, fast.</p>

<p>All week I've been taunted by two boxes of books to be donated, tripping me up at my front door. Seductively on the left is the summer read. These are well-worn books passed among female friends, picked up at the grocery store, a bit of romance tossed into the cart with the peanut butter of mundane life. It's "chick-lit"; the thinking woman's Harlequin. These stories tell of swarthy manhood being pressed against trembling flesh by Page 50, a face-slap and storming out of a mansion by 150 and then by 300, the sweet, torrent release of passion, the likes of which she had never known in her young life . . .</p>
<p>The other box is decidedly less fragrant. The covers show confident people in power-suits, arms crossed, wearing an "I know something you don't know" smirk. These are the so-called "fin-lit" (finance literature) books acquired the morning after gremlins stabbed sleep with shards of worry over things like not enough retirement funds, or underfunded pensions, life (and bank account) after kids and college. The spines of these books are as smooth as a Botoxed forehead, except for a slight fold in Smart Women Finish Rich. This book sadly doesn't involve a tall, dark and handsome saviour, but rather setting up a financial filing system with nine easy steps to rescue a damsel in RRSP distress. Who has time for that?</p>
<p>Like a lot of people, I'm worried and I don't see a retirement knight in shining armour on the horizon. It doesn't help to know my own government feels the same way, desperately taking a dog-and-pony show on the road looking for ideas to help pay for the final days of boomers like me. (Though I have to say that Canada's conservative, button-down-and-Dockers, boy-next-door approach looks pretty good right now compared to the rest of the world.)</p>
<p>One step back in the U.S., Obama is hardly riding a white horse, courting the same Wall Street crowd-turned-advisers who got us into this mess. These are the same guys who tricked people with no money into buying something they can't afford, and then repackaging it into something else to trick people with more money into buying, and then "shorting" this made-up "product" to make even more money.</p>
<p>If I've lost you, it's because it was designed to be hard to understand, and anyone who should have on your behalf didn't care anyway because they were making so much money selling it.</p>
<p>These are the people Obama bailed out with tax money taken from the average Joe, which crushes the economy and which costs us all. In one way or another, we've all paid for the money managers' cabanas in the Cayman Islands (with U.S. banks as co-conspirators). The individual investor didn't stand a chance of seeing the game clearly; they were being led down a path of plastic flowers, painted rainbows, free coffee and doughnuts.</p>
<p>Take another step back. The EU loan to Greece seems akin to giving a mortgage payment to someone who still can't afford their house, and anyway lied about their income to get it. And if you think Greece is an outlier with its 236 billion euros in debt, just imagine what's coming down the road for places like Ireland with its 867 billion owed, Spain with 1.1 trillion due (and 20 per cent unemployment), and Italy, leading slightly with 1.4 trillion, where Berlusconi's tax amnesty scheme pretty much admitted an economy based on tax avoidance. Even Germans can only work so hard.</p>
<p>I'm angry. As prudent as Canada is, when the world economy coughs we get swine flu. What's becoming apparent is that the whole system in which we've put our financial faith, our future, is built on a house of cards. It's based on an immoral premise. There are huge rewards for creating nothing, milking loopholes, skimming off a flip of something, exploiting the letter of the law while violating the spirit of it, preying on fears of people like me. "Kicker" news stories tell of five-yearolds with light sabres and kibble-chasing mice choosing better stock picks than the best guess of brokers. In my most cynical moments I'm convinced those techniques are just as likely to buy me a room with a view at "the home" as my carefully researched and cautiously appointed portfolio.</p>
<p>So last week, when my modest, middle-class, conscientiously scurried-away net-value fell dramatically, I decided to stay away from fin-lit and stick to the down and dirty reads. It's simply a case of the more you know the more you wish you didn't. At least in chick-lit when a girl gets taken and she's lying there spent, she can bank on some extravagant memories to get her through the night.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Animals behind most infections in humans; Experts push for curbing viruses at pig, chicken farms</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>447 words</div><div>24 May 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>

<p>U p to three-quarters of all emerging infectious diseases in humans come from animals, but Canada doesn't have an early-warning system to detect or prevent those illnesses. Instead, public-health officials respond as outbreaks occur, which is neither smart nor economically sound with a resurgence in new viruses, experts say.</p>
<p>Last year's H1N1 flu pandemic should serve as a wake-up call for the country to build a robust system to track diseases that could leap from animals to humans, says Donald Low, chief microbiologist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus -- a hybrid of swine, bird and human flu -- started in pigs, then jumped to humans, where it adapted to infect millions of people and kill an estimated 17,000 worldwide.</p>
<p>"Part of the problem that I think has been recognized with this pandemic is the major gaps and lack of surveillance that's been done in animals," says Low, who's also medical director of Ontario's public-health laboratories.</p>
<p>Viruses such as the flu, SARS and HIV, which originate in animals but also attack humans, are known as zoonotic diseases. Some experts blame the rise of zoonotic outbreaks on factory farms. Others argue the proximity of people, pigs and poultry, especially in the backyards and markets of Asia, is a breeding ground for new animal-to-human viruses.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, global travel and trade have made it easier for people and live animals to spread viruses rapidly, making surveillance a necessity, experts say.</p>
<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has traditionally focused on preventing outbreaks that only sicken animals, not humans, and impact the safety of Canada's food supply. The few zoonotic diseases that are monitored in animals include tuberculosis, brucellosis and bird flu, says Craig Stephen, a professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Calgary.</p>
<p>A report published by the U.S. Institute of Medicine last September, at the height of the H1N1 pandemic, found there was "no single example" of a well-functioning surveillance system in that country, or anywhere else.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Danuta Skowronski, an epidemiologist at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, the obvious place to build a first line of defence is on pig and chicken farms, where evolving animal viruses are most likely to infect humans.</p>

<p>It is not exactly true, as the authors of the experiment claim, that scientists have created artificial life in a laboratory in Maryland.</p>
<p>It is, however, true enough to be both scary and exciting and it has opened a new door in scientific research and human potential, for good or ill. On Thursday, Dr. J. Craig Venter announced he and his researchers had successfully created the world's first synthetic cell. "This is the first self-replicating species we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer," an exuberant Dr. Venter told a news conference. Synthetic DNA of one bacterium was mixed with another and injected into a living cell, where, after one or two failed attempts, it thrived. It may not be, as many scientists claim, the actual creation of artificial life because it involves using things that are already living -- "poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree," as Joyce Kilmer put it -- but it is definitely knocking on heaven's door.</p>
<p>As Dr. Venter said, as the technology improves, it will mean "transforming life totally from one species into another by changing the software." And once we start thinking of our DNA as "software" rather than the unalterable essence of our physical being, it may also transform the way we think about ourselves.</p>
<p>Whether this will be a good thing or a bad thing will be the subject of fierce debate in the months and years to come. Dr. Venter thinks it is unequivocally good, but he has a tendency to look at these things from a commercial point of view (having mapped the human genome, he would patent it for his exclusive use if he could) and the commercial opportunities artificial life represent are immeasurable.</p>
<p>Critics, both scientists and environmentalists, are already calling for strict regulations, even a moratorium on future research until we have a chance to figure out what it all means, or might mean, for the future of mankind.</p>
<p>That's not surprising coming from environmentalists who call even genetically modified crops such as wheat and canola "Frankenfoods." But when even reputable scientists working in the same field suggest "this kind of biology makes it possible, in the wrong hands, to create deadly pathogens and in the future... will call for strong regulations," governments should pay attention.</p>
<p>That comment comes from David Magnus, director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, and is echoed by many other scientists. Even more scientists, however, are eager to get in on the ground floor of this extraordinary new discovery.</p>
<p>There is, for better or worse, no shortage of real-life Dr. Frankensteins around, aching to create artificial life forms that will be better than what nature created for us. And in that context, it is worth remembering while Dr. Frankenstein himself was not a villain, the results of his experiments, intended to benefit mankind, were disastrous, both for himself and his monster.</p>
<p>Yet the benefits that might stem from Dr. Venter's research are almost incalculable. The scientist says the results of his work have "changed my views of the definitions of life and how life works." It may do that for all of us. Almost certainly, it could lead ultimately to synthetic biofuels -- your car might one day be powered by algae -- almost instant vaccines for new strains of deadly illnesses such H1N1 flu and treatments for other diseases that we can only imagine today.</p>
<p>It is a scientific dilemma, but as experience has taught us, the genie cannot be put back in the bottle. The Vatican may have summed it up best in its surprisingly open reception of the news, which it welcomed: "If it is used toward the good, to treat pathologies, we can only be positive... . If it turns out not to be...useful to respect the dignity of the person, then our judgment would change." In other words, it is an opportunity for humanity "to better understand and order creation," if we can control it.</p>

</p>
<p>What's odd is that I'm still waiting for the phone call in which I'm begged to do Saskatchewan a favour by calling all the shots this summer on road repair. On matters of ground transportation, I am the go-to guru guy.</p>
<p>As are you, probably.</p>
<p>We both drive, right?</p>
<p>Agreed, then. On potholes and broken pavement, we are of a shared expert view, namely: complain, moan, whine, bellyache, carp, gripe and bitch. Conversely, on summer road repairs, on detours and traffic rerouting, we rather tend to: bitch, carp, gripe, bellyache, whine, moan and then complain.</p>
<p>Yet never do we professional motorists, upon noticing an obvious flaw in road work, pull over and offer our constructive criticism. Surely if we pranced up to the nearest churning earth-mover, waved frantically and shouted, "Oh, yoo-hoo! Mister Heavy Equipment Operator! Please stop your large machinery," he would. Hands on our hips, eyeballs rolling in exasperation, it would be no great effort to inform the operator that all the work so far is wrong, wrong, wrong, that a single-lane squeeze to a left-turn exit makes no sense when a right-turn detour is clearly viable, and then to stomp away with hands flailing in the air for emphasis, like the hissy-pissy snit of a Broadway stage director who gets NO co-operation whatsoever. Most of us would be more inclined to stroll into a hospital operating theatre, bang on the glass and holler helpfully that the idiotic heart surgeon needs to shunt the anterior crucible BEFORE he sutures the gastronomic bivalve.</p>
<p>And why? Selfishness. The extended hospitalization from advising on road repair would be ours, not the heart patient's. Those earth-movers pack momentum.</p>
<p>I for one can longer keep my vast layman's knowledge of road engineering solely to myself. Free advice (yes, free) is only a paragraph away.</p>
<p>First of all, personnel changes are needed. Whoever is in charge of erecting signs, barricades and traffic cones for a construction zone, he needs to swap jobs with the supervisor who schedules equipment and men for the site. Sign Boss is a public works eager-beaver, every spring raring to go, his detours and warning signs erected days, weeks, sometimes months, before any semblance of work commences.</p>
<p>Although one sign we could without is always the first posted and by far the largest, the bilingual billboard proclaiming "Canada's Federal Economic Action Plan at Work Making Federally Planned Action," at either entrance of the action-free zone. Not surprisingly, this is the same sign, in poster form, that taunts arrivals to the federal unemployment office. Do we really need to be reminded that a gift of our own tax dollars for cost-shared road repairs came from the level of government run by politicians who fly to work? Complete spending control on streets and highway ought to go to public officials who know their pink windshield washer from their blue -- first provincially, or, failing that, municipally, or, if need be, goldarnit, no more messing around, Sign Boss.</p>
<p>Pity the poor beggar. There he is, personally responsible for thousands of drivers every day pulling into single file and slowing to a crawl through the orange zone -- and all for practice, a heck of a feat in human make-believe, rivaling even Y2K and H1N1.</p>
<p>Construction crews do eventually arrive, but just as mysteriously, a couple or three work days later, they disappear. Four hundred tons of heavy equipment and two dozen workers are portable, after all, not like some hefty plastic traffic cone.</p>
<p>I do not, however, agree with the popular suggestion that crews should stay put and work around the clock until the job is done. For starters, I personally would not want to do anything at 3 a.m., which is when, as a city resident, I sleep. My REEEMP-REEMP-REEEMP had best be an alarm clock, not the back-up warning of a dump truck.</p>
<p>And do we really want our roads built in the dark?</p>
<p>It's already a government contract. Far better that detour be only temporary, summer-long, not inadvertently extended, permanently, to Dauphin.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A step toward artificial life</b>
</div><div>By Sheryl Ubelacker   </div>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>In revolutionary research that may end up altering our definition of life, scientists have created the first synthetic cell powered by artificially created DNA.</p>
<p>The achievement caps 15 years of work by a large team of researchers, led by Craig Venter of Human Genome Project fame, who engineered a chromosome and inserted it into a bacterium to create a new living entity.</p>
<p>"This is the first self-replicating species that we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer," Venter told a teleconference presented Thursday by the journal Science, which published the work.</p>
<p>The cell, which contains more than a million DNA base pairs, or genetic letters - a mere speck compared with the six billion in human DNA - was created by writing genetic code on a computer, then combining a cocktail of chemicals to create a chromosome.</p>
<p>"We start with four bottles of chemicals and the digital code in the computer from DNA sequence," said Venter.</p>
<p>"You substitute the synthetic chromosome for the one that's in the cell and all of a sudden everything in the cell is made from that synthetic chromosome."</p>
<p>Once the bacterial cell was "booted up," it immediately began making proteins as prescribed by the new DNA and began dividing and replicating by the millions.</p>
<p>"This is an important step we think both scientifically and philosophically," said Venter.</p>
<p>"It certainly changed my views of the definitions of life and how life works."</p>
<p>Geneticist Stephen Scherer, a senior scientist at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children, called the research an "impressive technical feat."</p>
<p>"I suspect that when we look back, this achievement will be seen as a landmark in biology having somewhat similar impact to when Dolly the cloned sheep was introduced to the world," Scherer, who was not involved in the research, said by email.</p>
<p>Venter said the synthetic cell is a first - and early - step in designing artificial life forms that could one day produce biological fuels, pharmaceuticals and even foods.</p>
<p>"We actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we're already starting numerous avenues to use this tool."</p>
<p>A company Venter and co-author Dr. Hamilton Smith formed, called <span class="companylink">Synthetic Genomics</span>, is working with <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span> to develop new strains of algae that can capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and other sources to make hydrocarbons that can be refined into fuels.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health is also funding a project with pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">Novartis</span> to try to make synthetic DNA that could be used to manufacture vaccines in 24 hours instead of the weeks to months it normally takes.</p>
<p>"When you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out, we think we can shorten that process quite substantially," he said. Artificial DNA might also solve the problem of developing vaccines for quickly evolving viruses like the common cold or HIV.</p>
<p>For all the possible upsides, the work is sure to ignite debate over the ethics of humans tinkering with the essence of life, as well as fears about a plethora of potential harms.</p>
<p>Timothy Caulfield, an expert in health law and policy at the University of Alberta, said concerns could be similar to those surrounding genetically modified organisms and any potential threats to the environment and other living entities, including people.</p>
<p>"There's also a bit of a yuck factor response: is it appropriate for humans to be involved so fundamentally in the creation of life," Caulfield said from Edmonton.</p>
<p>"For me, I'm always a bit skeptical of the yuck factor. I think we need to have more rational arguments rather than just intuitive responses to these kinds of issues."</p>
<p>"At a minimum, I think we should start thinking about how you can have some kind of responsible oversight of this exciting field to ensure that we get the benefit and moderate any of the risks."</p>
<p>The research team said steps have been taken to ensure the synthetic bacterium cannot be confused with a cell containing natural DNA. Written into its genetic code are "watermarks" that spell out the signatures of all the researchers involved, a website address and three quotations.</p>
<p>One of them is from James Joyce: "To live, to err, to fall, to triumph and to recreate life out of life."</p>
<p>Still, Robert Friedman, head of policy at the J. Craig Venter Institute in California, conceded that a bioterrorist could try to use the technology to synthesize any number of potentially deadly pathogens, which are contained in regulated laboratories and closely guarded government facilities.</p>
<p>"This is a new way to do that. Rather than having to find it in nature or steal it, one could synthesize it," he said, noting that there is a pending registry that would flag authorities if someone tried to order the genetic and chemical makings for synthetic DNA.</p>
<p>"I think we have ways to deal with the potential misuse and it gives us the opportunity to really take advantage of the potential benefits."</p>

<p>Re: Overpaid? Yes, it is absolutely possible, May 17.</p>
<p>Unlike many of his counterpart hospital CEOs, Dr. Jack Kitts is not just an administrator, but also a caring physician. He has both the business and medical expertise needed to manage a very large and complex institution.</p>
<p>The Ottawa Hospital is the largest health-care centre in Canada with three campuses, about 1,200 beds, an operating budget of $1 billion, and 12,000 staff members. It is misleading to compare his salary to other hospital CEOs managing smaller institutions.</p>
<p>As a physician, I am proud to work at the Ottawa Hospital under his leadership. He regularly meets with physicians, nurses, and all members of the health-care team to ensure that the patient is at the centre of our care, and that we deliver the best possible care in a respectful and compassionate manner.</p>
<p>He believes and lives these values, and continues to inspire and instill these values in our team. He is available 24/7 whether he's meeting with our department on a Saturday morning, helping out as a volunteer during the H1N1 crisis or bringing the concerns of a patient back to the health-care team to make things better.</p>
<p>Kitts has a difficult task of managing physicians, nurses, and allied health care givers, along with their union representatives, in a fiscally constrained era. Any complaints expressed must ultimately be answered by him.</p>
<p>Despite the size of the Ottawa Hospital, he knows many of the staff (nurses, physicians, cleaning staff, etc.) on a first-name basis. He rejects mediocrity in providing health care to our patients, repeatedly asking for external reviews of our team to identify how we can strive to be the best we can. He did this long before and not because the province linked performance to salaries.</p>
<p>CEOs managing other health-care institutions in Ontario are paid significantly more than Kitts on a per bed basis, and these CEOs have no medical background. You get what you pay for.</p>
<p>We should consider ourselves fortunate to have such an intelligent, dedicated and committed CEO managing our hospital.</p>

<p>As Albertans we might not have an oil slick the size of Luxembourg heading our way as do the beleaguered folk along the U.S. Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>However, we do have an environmental disaster that has already washed up on our shores, so to speak, and is moving inland with unnerving speed. Communities in its path couldn't be more scared if they were Biloxi, Miss., or Mobile, Ala., watching their coastline turn black.</p>
<p>Our disaster is the mountain pine beetle: Mother Nature's chainsaw.</p>
<p>You've no doubt heard of the beetle and perhaps seen its handiwork in the patchwork of dead and dying trees colouring whole swaths of the countryside red and yellow, as if a deciduous autumn had descended on the evergreen forests. The beetle, in cahoots with a symbiotic organism called the blue-stained fungus, has devastated B.C. forests and has set its antennae on Alberta, where, according to the Alberta Forest Products Association, it has infected about three million trees.</p>
<p>The mountain pine beetle is to a lodgepole pine what a BP oil slick is to a nesting pelican. It is the H1N1 virus, smallpox and bubonic plague all rolled into one. The only effective treatment after infection is amputation with a chainsaw.</p>
<p>And now, communities in its path are complaining that the Alberta government is not doing enough to help them prepare for a future without forests.</p>
<p>We have 50 communities where the forestry industry is important and 12 where it is crucial. All of them are looking to the devastation in B.C. where the beetle -- recently described as one of North America's largest natural disasters -- will put an estimated 16 major sawmills out of business.</p>
<p>Driving the fear and frustration in Alberta is an unreleased report from the provincial government's Mountain Pine Beetle Advisory Committee which says the infestation is "here to stay" and it will have a "profound impact."</p>
<p>"The time to plan and act is now," concludes the report. It was written in 2007 but was never made public.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean it's gathering dust on a shelf. Someone has leaked it and the report is now embarked on an infestation of its own through forestry communities where people are passing it surreptitiously hand to hand.</p>
<p>"Alberta's forest-based communities run a serious risk of significant consequences if they choose to do nothing," concludes the report obtained by The Journal. "The impacts of the MPB (mountain pine beetle) infestation can be mitigated but communities cannot do it on their own. Industry, communities and government must act co-operatively to manage the risks and maximize the opportunities."</p>
<p>Hinton Mayor Glenn Taylor is one of those who has seen the report and is troubled that the government is not doing more to help communities "retool" for an economy after the pine beetle has devastated the forests.</p>
<p>"We appreciate the work being done to contain the pine beetle infestation, which was the initial focus of the British Columbia government as well," says Taylor. "Our concerns are broader than that from the lessons learned from British Columbia . . . Communities are separate from the industry and certainly separate from the resource if the resource is gone. That is the concern being discussed at the community level in our region."</p>
<p>Taylor says the communities are not asking for much money. He points to a recommendation in the report calling for $5 million to be spent over three years to help communities find ways to diversify their economies.</p>
<p>"Our desire has always been to responsible, long-term sustainable planning prior to an emergency hitting. This isn't like a flash flood where it rises and overruns the dam or a wildfire that sweeps through. This is not unlike many other municipal emergencies where we can reasonably expect a certain thing to happen. Therefore, we should be planning during quiet times to ensure that our actions are proper during the hectic times."</p>
<p>In response, Sustainable Resource Development Minister Mel Knight is more optimistic. He says the government has spent $270 million to prevent the spread of the mountain pine beetle infestation and government officials point out they allocated $50 million in 20 bioenergy grants to help forestry companies diversify.</p>
<p>Knight doesn't agree with the recommendation to spend $5 million over three years to help communities diversify away from trees -- or what is known in the industry as "fibre."</p>
<p>"You look at the opportunities that forest companies have presented us with ways to utilize that fibre, ways to reinvigorate after the fact and start replanting and regenerating of the forest resource. At the end of the day, unless this thing completely gets away from us, we'll be in a situation where those communities that have connections to the fibre industry will by and large remain productive and their economies would be held relatively intact."</p>
<p>However, Taylor is afraid that, based on what happened in B.C., the infestation will indeed "completely get away from us."</p>
<p>He wants to know what the government will do about it. At this point, we don't know.</p>
<p>Knight says he won't know the extent of this year's beetle infestation until next month. But that's a short-term concern. It's still unclear why he isn't taking the government's own advisory committee's recommendations about long-term concerns more to heart -- especially when he has acknowledged the seriousness of the danger by saying we are "on the front line in a war zone."</p>
<p>What's going to confuse the issue moving forward is that the forestry industry is on the cusp of a boom because companies will be harvesting millions of trees killed by the beetles.</p>
<p>It's called a "surge" and it happened for a few years in B.C. -- right before the mills began running out of trees and started shutting.</p>
<p>Taylor calls the surge a "false economy" and says we -- government, industry and communities -- have to start preparing for the impending bad times while not getting distracted by the good: "We need to be preparing for what comes next."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Just call it an animal attraction; Veterinary careers combine art, science and love for job</b>
</div><div>Denise Deveau   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>700 words</div><div>19 May 2010</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>F1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>In any given day, Sandie Black could be checking out a tarantula's state of health, clipping the toenails of a feisty snowy owl or delivering tiger cubs.</p>
<p>As head of veterinary services at the Calgary Zoo, she says choosing a veterinary career was the best decision she ever made.</p>
<p>"The animals are incredibly beautiful and diverse, the work is fascinating and I have an opportunity to be learning all the time."</p>
<p>When talking to those who love veterinary work, variety is a major drawing card. "For me it's the chance to mix art and science," says Stacey White, who began his veterinary career as a large animal vet and now works with small animals at the Jane Animal Clinic in Toronto. "There was never a time that I didn't want to be a vet. But I preferred to have a job where I wasn't on call all the time and I love the fact you hardly ever do the same thing."</p>
<p>Black agrees that veterinary medicine is an ideal choice for someone who likes a multi-disciplined job, since you can get involved in many more facets than medical practitioners. "You can do your own pathology, anesthesia, surgeries and X-rays. You can work on small animals or large. A lot of your time is spent on preventive medicines -- from vaccines to foot care."</p>
<p>While veterinary degrees tend to be general, with a few electives offered in the final year, residencies and internships are what get your foot in the door of more specialized disciplines. "I came in with a desire to do wildlife and zoo work, so as an undergrad I worked on getting summer jobs to develop that," Black says. She nabbed a residency at the Toronto Zoo when she graduated. To build up her skills, she followed with some international consulting work, spent a year in a small and exotic animal practice, then joined the Calgary Zoo in 1989.</p>
<p>One thing that people interested in pursuing a veterinary career might not realize is the school of choice depends on where you live, says Elizabeth Lowenger, diversity and careers co-ordinator at the Ontario Veterinary College at the University of Guelph. "Each school has a territory it services. You have to apply within the province you live. If you're in Ontario, for example, we are the only vet school you can go to."</p>
<p>Those wishing to study out of their territory must reside in the province of choice for 12 months. "Some will move for a year, work and then apply," she says.</p>
<p>Lowenger says there has been a significant change in veterinary medicine over the years. "Years ago it used to be all about food animals and horses and keeping them healthy. Since the 1960s, there has been a huge explosion in small animal medicine. There is also a big need in large animal veterinary practice."</p>
<p>Veterinary grads less interested in hands-on work could opt for research or inspection jobs with consultancies and/or government agencies. Lowenger says veterinary medicine is also playing an increasingly important role in public health, for example. "If you look at all the emerging, pandemic-type diseases such as avian influenza and swine flu, they start in animals before being passed on to humans. Veterinarians are becoming hugely involved in public health and controlling the spread of disease at the animal level."</p>
<p>And it's the willingness to learn and practical experience gained while at school that can help improve chances of getting into the specialty you covet, says Black. "The biggest thing we look for is a demonstrated interest. [Applicants] need to be serious about the field and put time into courses and clinical work."</p>
<p>As far as career prospects for vets are concerned, "there is never a problem getting work," White says.</p>
<p>"There are always jobs available."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Cascades' handy solution; Anti-bacterial paper towels</b>
</div><div>Nicolas Van Praet    </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>617 words</div><div>19 May 2010</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>FP1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 National Post . All Rights Reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>MONTREAL - <span class="companylink">Cascades Inc</span>. is declaring war on the automatic hand dryer.</p>
<p>The Quebec packaging and tissue paper producer is making a million-dollar bet that it can replace at least some of the thousands of blow dryers in North America's washrooms with a new anti-bacterial paper towel it created and unveiled yesterday.</p>
<p>Cascades says it invested five years of research and development work to come up with the mint-coloured paper towels. Their uniqueness is that they release benzalkonium chloride, a common germ fighter, when touched by wet hands.</p>
<p>Cascades says this reduces the number of bacteria left on hands and protects against further bacterial contamination for half an hour. And the towels can be recycled.</p>
<p>The initiative is more of an opportunity for Cascades to showcase its innovation than to generate significant revenue, at least initially. The company forecasts it can snare 35% of the $50-million annual Canadian paper-towel market in the near term.</p>
<p>And that would mean a domestic sales potential of $17.5-million. Cascades tallied a $60-million profit last year on revenue of $3.87-billion.</p>
<p>"This is about distinguishing ourselves," Alain Lemaire, Cascades' chief executive, said in an interview at the company's Montreal offices. "It's about being known as a supplier with an even wider range of hygiene products."</p>
<p>Public-health experts have singled out poor hand washing as a major public-health issue continent-wide, blaming it for millions of lost work hours every year. Outbreaks such as last year's H1N1 flu pandemic reinforced the issue, boosting sales of <span class="companylink">Johnson & Johnson</span>'s Purell and other hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>Regular paper towels dry hands without providing any additional protection while typical alcohol-based antiseptics and soaps lose their anti-bacterial effectiveness more quickly than the Cascades paper towels, Cascades executives said. Automatic hand dryers blast germs from the hands into the air, making matters potentially worse, the executives said, citing World Health Organization findings.</p>
<p>That claim has been challenged by hand-dryer manufacturers. East Longmeadow, Mass.-based Excel Dryer Inc., maker of the XLerator high-speed dryer, argues several studies have been published in well-known medical reviews on the health benefits and hygienic superiority of hand dryers. The company supplies a variety of high-profile clients including Dunkin Donuts, <span class="companylink">Target Corp</span>. and the U.S. government, equipping the USS Nimitz and USS Lincoln aircraft carriers and USS Fitzgerald destroyer.</p>
<p>"They do their research and they try out the dryers," Excel marketing director William Gagnon said of his clients. "At the end of the day, we offer the most and are still the best."</p>
<p>Cascades said its paper towels will be distributed in Canada initially. It will also seek U.S. government approval to sell them in the United States.</p>
<p>The company is targeting customers operating places of business where bacterial propagation by hand contact is a major issue, such as food processors, restaurants, medical centres, schools and cruise-ship lines. It estimated the towels could cost 15% more than regular towels.</p>
<p>Bernard Lemaire, executive vice-chairman of Cascades, said the company is trying to get its hand towels into Montreal's Trudeau International Airport but the airport authority isn't biting. It uses automatic dryers. "It hurts me that we can't get in there," in an institution in our home market, he said.</p>
<p>Cascades officials said the research on anti-bacterial paper could lead to new products in different business lines such as food packaging. The firm is the largest meat-processing package producer in Canada and a major producer of egg trays.</p>

<p>Alyshah Kaba had an "eyeopening" revelation about her career path in the slums of Kibera, Kenya, last summer.</p>
<p>Kaba, then a McMaster nursing student doing her placement, was developing a family planning program for the region, but discovered she lacked a much-needed understanding of global health issues.</p>
<p>"I realized I didn't have any health management skills," the 23-year-old said. "I didn't understand the global context that was outside of the clinical context of nursing."</p>
<p>When Kaba came home, she began looking at graduate schools. "I needed more tools for my toolbox to be complete," she said.</p>
<p>The nursing graduate has been accepted to a new master's of science program in global health that is a joint program between McMaster University and Maastricht University in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The program, which was three years in the making and believed to be unique in Canada, will begin September and aims to produce a workforce equipped to deal with transnational health issues, such as recent H1N1 and SARS epidemics or global illnesses such as diabetes and cancer.</p>
<p>"The purpose for this design is to create a workforce that is truly global in nature, that they understand complicated international issues," said Dr. Andrea Baumann, associate vice-president of the faculty of health sciences international. "They can work in interdisciplinary teams ... understand providing the service as well as evaluating the service, as well as implementing strategy."</p>
<p>The 25 students starting the one-year program at McMaster in September will choose one of three tracks: globalization and development, global health management and global diseases.</p>
<p>The students have the option of doing their second semester at Maastricht University. They will also have the opportunity to work in a low- or middle-income country. Baumann said this will probably be in India.</p>
<p>She added they have set up a week-long seminar in India for all the students in which they will simulate a global health meeting, presenting papers and developing strategies.</p>
<p>Students from health science, business and global governance backgrounds have been accepted to the new program.</p>
<p>"It's truly transnational as well as cross-disciplinary," Baumann said.</p>
<p>"A couple years ago, it was international health. Now it's global health," Kaba said. "That's because diseases aren't staying in one boundary ... they're moving."</p>

</div><div>AFP</div>

</p>
<p>The World Health Organization received backing from member states yesterday over its handling of the flu pandemic as WHO chief Margaret Chan said the world had been "lucky" with H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>As the WHO's annual assembly opened here, French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot bluntly dismissed criticism of the UN health agency as "unjust."</p>
<p>Chan told representatives of the WHO's 193 member states that "good news" in public health terms was normally driven by political commitment, resources and the ability to deliver care.</p>
<p>"Sometimes, though, we are just plain lucky. This has been the case with the H1N1 influenza pandemic," she said.</p>
<p>"The virus did not mutate to a more lethal form," while the vaccine worked and it showed little resistance to anti-viral drugs, Chan added.</p>
<p>The WHO chief acknowledged that "a few health systems were overwhelmed and the effects were usually short-lived.</p>
<p>"Had things gone wrong in any of these areas, we would have a very different agenda before us today," she added.</p>
<p>Some health experts and politicians have criticized the WHO-led global effort against the H1N1 flu after the new virus was uncovered in Mexico in April last year, claiming there was an over-reaction.</p>
<p>Swine flu was declared a pandemic as it rapidly spread around the world, prompting massive spending on largely unused swine flu vaccine and emergency precautions.</p>
<p>Bachelot said knowledge about the severity of the virus was "imperfect" in the beginning, yet decisive action had to be taken.</p>
<p>She also expressed concern about the perception of the threat, arguing the public underestimated the risks.</p>
<p>"The vaccine, which was the answer to a real danger, turned into a source of risk in the collective mind," Bachelot said.</p>
<p>The French health minister also warned that doubts about expert advice and the role of the pharmaceutical industry could undermine future alerts.</p>
<p>"The effects of this smear campaign are potentially devastating," she said.</p>
<p>Pandemic flu has left 18,030 people dead since the virus was first uncovered.</p>

<p>CONCERT REVIEW</p>
<p>DAVID GRAY</p>
<p>With: Royal Wood</p>
<p>When: Sunday night</p>
<p>Where: Jubilee Auditorium</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>The signature head-bobbing began in silhouette.</p>
<p>Seconds later, the makeshift white scrim came down and there stood David Gray, the English singer-songwriter who shot to international fame a decade ago with hits like Babylon and Sail Away.</p>
<p>Gray's sweet hoarseness endures, as we heard Sunday night at the Jubilee, but his musical style has evolved from those folksy acoustic days. His sound is more electronic, more rock-y, more ... loud. You expect to need earplugs at Aerosmith. But at David Gray?</p>
<p>Evidently evolution, including volume, is a good thing in Edmonton's eyes. The sold-out house was all Gray's as he beat our eardrums black and blue for more than two hours with the meatier live versions of the classics, as well as tracks from Draw the Line, his latest album. Gray was energized -- his noggin knocking, his left knee ticking out the beat like a metronome -- and genuine. We know he's done these tunes hundreds, thousands of times. But they still felt fresh, just for us.</p>
<p>"I don't get around here very often so I'll try to cover as many bases as I can," said Gray, whose ultra-romantic Folk Fest performance in 2006 made for a memorable starry night on the hill.</p>
<p>To me, the sound felt distorted and bass-heavy, especially early on, as though the levels were set for a much bigger venue, perhaps outdoors. I didn't feel pulled in; I felt like I needed to back up. Perhaps I was just geared up for something a little more unplugged.</p>
<p>But to the Jubilee crowd, Gray and his four-member band could do no wrong. They showered the singer with adoring shout-outs, sang along with choruses and happily leaped up at Gray's suggestion.</p>
<p>The singer's vocal cords grew scratchy and irritated as the show went on, forcing the touring artist to offer a funny explanation. Apparently, Canada's great outdoors is to blame.</p>
<p>"My voice is done in. All that fresh air, it's corrosive. I need to get back to the swine-flu-infested homeland that I'm used to."</p>
<p>Gray toned it down with several endearing, dressed-down numbers on guitar. A welcome balm. Yes, the Gray of heart-thumping ballad yore is still in there.</p>
<p>Toronto's Royal Wood got things started Sunday with generous banter and a selection of songs from his new album, The Waiting. Alone onstage but for his piano, strings and backup guitarist, Wood was a delightful contradiction: dressed up in his shirt and red tie, but dressed down musically. He impressed me with a voice that's remarkably beautiful live. That said, I'd have preferred to hear it more in song. The charming musician is as humorous as he is handsome, but when you're the support, you can't spend too much of your "15 minutes" chewing the fat.</p>
<p>Save the talk for when you're the main act, Royal. Which you will be, soon.</p>

<p>REVIEWS BY YOU</p>
<p>Here's what some visitors to edmontonjournal.comhad to say about the David Gray concert:</p>
<p>- Amazing as always. Only complaint is that he had the crowd really into it during Please Forgive Me before we all had to sit down again and the energy was lost a bit when he followed up with some slower songs during his encore. Great show. Also, I was looking forward to Royal Wood and was not disappointed. What a great Canadian talent. I'm sure his popularity will only increase as the tour continues.</p>
<p>- Incredible. Saw him at Folk Fest few years ago. Such a different concert last night. Much more "rock" than "folk." I have never seen a musician put so much of his heart and soul into each number.</p>
<p>- Unbelievable. The musical talent and vocal range seem to have no ceiling. Musical intoxication.</p>

</p>
<p>North Division</p>
<p>Calgary Vipers</p>
<p>- 2009 record: 49-27</p>
<p>- In the bullpen: Third-year ace Joe Sergent is joined by former Major-leaguer Anastacio Martinez and a wealth of hard-throwing young talent.</p>
<p>- At the plate: Veteran outfielder Drew Miller can hit for power and average, along with slick-fielding, third-year 2B Jorge Mejia.</p>
<p>- Bottom line: Should submit strong bid for championship repeat with nine returning players from 2009 roster. Departure of MVP Nelson Castro leaves big hole to fill.</p>
<p>St. George Roadrunners</p>
<p>- 2009 record: 48-34</p>
<p>- In the bullpen: Ex-Viper Bart Fortunato tops the relievers, while former Major-leaguer Raymar Diaz could head starters.</p>
<p>- At the plate: Ruddy Yan hit .367 last season, while former Viper Yosvanny Almario wasn't far behind at .311, with eight homers.</p>
<p>- Bottom line: Move over from South Division, where they were No. 1 last year. New manager Darryl Evans inherits solid lineup.</p>
<p>Edmonton Capitals</p>
<p>- 2009 record: 44-38</p>
<p>- In the bullpen: A couple of ex-Major Leaguers -- Lou Pote, their ace last year, and Clinton Nageotte -- anchor the staff.</p>
<p>- At the plate: Former Oriole Larry Bigbie and Cliff Brumbaugh, who had time with Texas and Colorado, should swing plus-.300.</p>
<p>- Bottom line: With good returning nucleus, will look to make amends for losses to Calgary in division final past two years.</p>
<p>Victoria Seals</p>
<p>- 2009 record: 32-50</p>
<p>- In the bullpen: Proven Brandon Villafuerte returns along with leftie Jason Kershner, a former Major-leaguer.</p>
<p>- At the plate: Calgarian and ex-Viper Colin Moro can play infield and outfield and swings a tough bat. 2B Wilber Perez also has good power.</p>
<p>- Bottom line: New manager Bret Boone should bring winning attitude to second-year team.</p>
<p>Chico Outlaws</p>
<p>- 2009 record: 33-44</p>
<p>- In the bullpen: Mark Lemore could be ace among several ex-Major Leaguers. X-factor is 18-year-old knuckleballer Eri Yoshida. Is she legit or promo fodder?</p>
<p>- At the plate: Ex-Viper Ivan Reyes finished off year with Outlaws and boosted average from .252 to .342 in 10 games. Blake Gailen hit a scary .355</p>
<p>- Bottom line: Garry Templeton steps in as manager and will be looking for more consistency this season.</p>
<p>South Division</p>
<p>Tucson Toros</p>
<p>- 2009 record: 38-35</p>
<p>- In the bullpen: Lorenzo Barcelo returns to starting rotation off an 8-5 record and 96 strikeouts. Leftie Vince Davis delivers the second punch.</p>
<p>- At the plate: Former Major Leaguer Jim Rushford hit .333 and batted in 66 runs. Josh Womack of <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> fame hit .277.</p>
<p>- Bottom line: Lost to Calgary in league championship last year after upsetting St. George in South Division final. Balanced lineup delivers with pitching and hitting.</p>
<p>Orange County Flyers</p>
<p>- 2009 record: 37-39</p>
<p>- In the bullpen: Matt Durkin had a league-leading 11 wins last year. World Series champ and former Arizona Diamondback Bjung Hyun Kim is new to the team.</p>
<p>- At the plate: A couple of ex-Major Leaguers in Keith Ginter and Ben Johnson, along with .324-hitting infielder Jimmy Rohan.</p>
<p>- Bottom line: Flyers will be out to regain their 2008 league championship form under first-year manager Paul Abbott.</p>
<p>Yuma Scorpions</p>
<p>- 2009 record: 29-47</p>
<p>- In the bullpen: Southpaw Bill Pulsipher checks in from the Major Leagues and joins proven right-hander Daivis Burguillos, a former Viper.</p>
<p>- At the plate: Carlos Duncan gets more bat time after finishing as a pinch-hitter with the Vipers. It's unknown if SS Nelson Castro, who was league MVP with the Vipers last year, will play.</p>
<p>- Bottom line: Peter Young, the former Vipers club president, will look to stockpile mostly with Venezuelan players for former Viper slugger and manager Darryl Brinkley.</p>
<p>Strong Warriors of Maui</p>
<p>- Expansion team: Sketchy details at this point. Former Viper Evan Greusel might join the pitching staff while another former Viper, Fehlandt Lentini, brings a big game to centre field and the plate. Cory Snyder moves over from St. George as manager.</p>
<p>Tijuana Cimarrones</p>
<p>- Expansion team: Tijuana was poised to join the league last year but pulled out a couple weeks before the season opened because of the H1N1 scare. Outside of Enrique Brito serving as manager, it's all guesswork at this point, as a roster has yet to be posted on team or league website.</p>

<p>Through the eyepiece of his microscope, Ken Brandt has witnessed four decades of flu, epidemics and pandemics.</p>
<p>You might expect the 63-year-old would be counting down the days to retirement. Instead he's been counting the days to a promise finally fulfilled -- the formal opening of the new $55.5-million cutting-edge Saskatchewan Disease Control Lab.</p>
<p>The manager of the lab's virology section could have retired after 35 years of service, but he was waiting for today.</p>
<p>"They probably did 14 or 15 studies over the years and at one time they already had plans made up to build a new lab by the Plains Hospital," Brandt said.</p>
<p>"Then the government changed and they scrapped that plan. Our hopes had been built up so many times about a new facility, but when it actually became a reality, and with the plans they were talking about, I wanted to stay and work in this state-of-the-art facility."</p>
<p>After graduating with a biology degree from the University of Saskatchewan, Regina campus, Brandt's job at the lab began as summer employment.</p>
<p>"It's a job that just keeps getting more interesting," he said. "In the 42 years I've been here, I've never been bored."</p>
<p>Originally, he worked in the water lab, but soon he was transferred to the virology section. That year an epidemic of Western equine encephalitis -- a disease that is spread to horses and humans by infected mosquitoes -- broke out in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>"It's come full circle because now we have West Nile," Brandt said. "That was also the time of the last pandemic -- the Hong Kong flu in 1968. We've come full circle again with the H1N1 (pandemic). It's been quite interesting."</p>
<p>Technology radically changed during Brandt's tenure.</p>
<p>"When I first started, there were a lot of manual procedures, which were very labour intensive," he said. "Over the years there's been a lot more automation. The turnaround time to get results has dramatically improved."</p>
<p>Now, instead of waiting up to a week to get results from growing a virus in the lab, the answer can be available in hours.</p>
<p>Dr. Greg Horsman, medical director of the lab, used the promise of a sophisticated lab to entice Dr. Paul Levett to move to Regina in 2003 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Levett, the assistant clinical director, said the new lab will allow "us to do real cutting-edge, forefront scientific diagnosis and typing in a modern facility where it's been designed for that purpose.</p>
<p>"Over the last 50 years, laboratory techniques have changed phenomenally and buildings that were designed and constructed 50 years ago simply can't accommodate the kind of work that's necessary now without real significant changes.</p>
<p>"I think we all feel most happy for people like Ken who have been working here for 30 years or more because they'll have the opportunity to work in a state-of-the-art building."</p>
<p>Unlike the airy and well-lit lab building in Research Park, the premises at 3211 Albert St. were dark, dingy and cramped.</p>
<p>"Many people never saw the light of day in the old lab," said executive director Bob Firnesz. "The old lab was designed to accommodate about 60 or 70 people ideally and that number has grown to 160, so certainly there was overcrowding."</p>
<p>Tests will done in a safer environment, Levett said.</p>
<p>"There were real safety concerns with some of the techniques that we had to use," he said.</p>
<p>Brandt feels safer in the spacious new lab.</p>
<p>"When you have that many people working in a small space and you have positive culture tubes, the chance of an accident would be there," he said. "Now it's designed properly."</p>
<p>Departments started moving from the old lab to the new building in late January.</p>
<p>"It was kind of a rolling move," Levett said. "One section would move and would be back up to speed and then another one would move."</p>
<p>The molecular department is slated to relocate June 9. Tuberculosis testing will continue at the old lab until the Containment Level 3 lab is certified by Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.</p>
<p>The lab's diverse services range from routine testing of water to disease outbreak identification and control.</p>
<p>The lab analyzes drinking and non-drinking water that includes swimming pools, lakes, streams and sewage lagoons from small towns.</p>
<p>"We have private customers and municipal customers that are regulated by the Environment Ministry," said Dr. Phil Bailey. "Also, we have customers that are regulated by Population Health -- so businesses, parks and campgrounds."</p>
<p>Many of Saskatchewan's boil water orders are triggered by positive tests coming out of the lab.</p>
<p>"One of the functions of a public health lab is to monitor the vaccine-preventable diseases and we do a lot of testing to make sure there is no recurrence of mumps or rubella or measles," Horsman said.</p>
<p>"We do the tuberculosis testing for the southern part of the province. This is one of the things that we'll be putting into the Level 3 lab."</p>
<p>The newborn screening program, which expanded seven years ago from two tests to 28 tests can detect conditions such as amino acid disorders and cystic fibrosis.</p>
<p>"If you pick up cystic fibrosis, they have less hospitalizations," Horsman said.</p>
<p>Early detection of rare diseases picked up with the newborn screening can be very significant -- in some cases, the difference between life and death, he said.</p>
<p>"Public health labs are the early warning system for the province," Horsman said.</p>

</p>
<p>The Manitoba Home Builders' Association supports a culture of occupational safety and health to make the province's residential construction sector safer for its workers.</p>
<p>The MHBA Workplace Safety and Health Committee, established in 2002, plays a key role in promoting safety and health for its members. This committee works with the province's Workplace Safety and Health Division and the Construction Safety Association of Manitoba to develop training and education, highlighting safety on work sites.</p>
<p>In addition to participating in Manitoba's annual construction safety conference, the MHBA co-ordinates a two-day housing forum each year. Last year, members heard presentations on topics such as safety audits, loss prevention, fire safety and H1N1 awareness.</p>
<p>The MHBA also offers a subcontractor safety course that outlines the importance of safety on site, educates building sub-contractors and trades on their responsibilities as employers and explains how to conduct a hazard assessment, inspection and toolbox talk.</p>
<p>Fall protection is one of the association's most important training programs. To that end, the Fall Protection Training Centre was established. This facility reflects real-life working conditions and provides practical training to workers in the trades on using fall-protection systems.</p>
<p>Because residential construction in Manitoba continues to experience active growth, effective measures for safety and health must be created and used on every job site. In 2008, following a key focus of its workplace safety and health committee, the MHBA board of directors mandated that all builder members must have a certified safety program, such as the Certificate of Recognition (COR). Now, more than 70 per cent of all new homes built in Manitoba are constructed by companies that are safety certified.</p>
<p>The Manitoba Home Builders' Association and its member builders continue to promote safety on the work site for the betterment of the industry, the client and the worker. Safety is good business.</p>

<p>Saskatchewan received a B-plus -- the highest grade among provinces -- in a recent Canadian Newspaper Association audit of how readily officials respond to requests for information from the public.</p>
<p>Audit leader Fred Vallance-Jones said the grade indicates how the province performed on a specific test, but it isn't necessarily a statement on the overall effectiveness of the access to information system.</p>
<p>"The idea is that you can look at this and say, 'OK, in answering the relatively straightforward requests that are included in this audit, Saskatchewan shows that it's able to do a better job than Ontario or some other places that take longer or charge more,' " said Vallance-Jones, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of King's College in Halifax.</p>
<p>Grades were awarded based on the speed and completeness of disclosure, with Quebec and Manitoba next in line to Saskatchewan with B's. Ontario and B.C. were at the bottom of the pack with D pluses.</p>
<p>Each provincial government was sent five information requests. Saskatchewan had a quick reply to a request that went to each province's education ministry asking to see the plan for dealing with the H1N1 flu, with the province responding on the same day it got the request.</p>
<p>Another request asked the provinces to provide an electronic list of all information requests received by the justice ministry over a set time period. Only P.E.I., Yukon and Saskatchewan released the records as requested, although it took Saskatchewan three months.</p>
<p>Regina, Saskatoon and Yorkton, which as municipalities were sent requests similar to those received by provincial governments, received As. Moose Jaw got a C plus.</p>
<p>Nationally, the audit found nearly three-quarters of requests sent to municipal, provincial and federal governments as well as one university per province were responded to within the 30-day time limit set out in access to information legislation.</p>
<p>But the report also flagged problems such as inconsistent responses and high fees for information, including the $98,603 requested by the B.C. Ministry of Transportation to produce information on cellphone usage.</p>
<p>The report also noted federal institutions are processing freedom of information requests at a slower rate compared to provinces and municipalities, with only 50 per cent of requests getting responses within 30 days.</p>
<p>Vallance-Jones said the ability of the public to access information in order to make informed decisions is important for democracy.</p>
<p>"It's difficult to make informed choices if all you're getting is the carefully manicured, carefully shaped public relations strategy of the government and on the other hand the probably overly critical point of view from the opposition," he said "These access acts allow citizens and their sort of quasi-representatives, whether they be journalists or lobby groups or others who participate actively in the public debate, to get at the source documents . . . and documents, while they don't always tell the truth, at least they don't change their stories."</p>

</p>
<p>Information requested by the public flows from municipal administrators in Banff as quickly and clearly as the Bow River that runs through town, according to a survey that tested government agencies across the country.</p>
<p>Banff was among five agencies that topped the Canadian Newspaper Association's annual freedom-of-information audit with an A+ grade.</p>
<p>The survey tested 61 government departments and agencies at the federal, provincial and municipal level by measuring how long it took them to respond to requests for information routinely available to the public.</p>
<p>Although Banff and other Alberta municipalities scored well -- Edmonton and Lethbridge got A's, Calgary received an A--- the Canadian Newspaper Association raised concerns about slow and inconsistent responses in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>Nearly half of the 315 formal requests to municipal, provincial and federal governments seeking records such as pandemic flu plans, trip expenses for senior officials and public land transactions were met with denials, fees and time delays reaching as long as half a year.</p>
<p>"All democracies are built on the basis of openness and transparency," said John Hinds, president and CEO of the association.</p>
<p>"This year's audit shows us that the system in Canada continues to be under strain, especially at the federal level. The concept of freedom of information has been eroded."</p>
<p>Getting a list of publicly-funded contracts from the <span class="companylink">Canadian Broadcasting Corp</span>. will cost you $20,825.</p>
<p>The B.C. Ministry of Transportation would like $98,603 to provide you with the number of cellphones used by its civil servants and how much they cost.</p>
<p>Banff, meanwhile, responded to all five test requests in a week or less and didn't charge any search or photocopying fees.</p>
<p>"If someone asks for something and it's not protected information, people can have it without the formality of making an (access-to-information) request," said Cheryl Hyde, Banff's town clerk and freedom-of-information co-ordinator.</p>
<p>The 39 municipalities tested were asked for the cost of employee-issued cellphone use, H1N1 flu response plans, meeting attendance records for municipal councillors, transactions involving municipally-owned land, the mayor's travel expenses during his/her most recent out-of-province business trip.</p>
<p>In Banff's case, Hyde said some of the information was already available publicly or easy to find without making the requester fill out an access-to-information request.</p>
<p>"A lot of times people want something that's available on the (town) website," said Hyde, adding the last time the town processed a formal access-to-information request was in 2004.</p>
<p>Federal departments and agencies rose highest on the secrecy scale, often failing to respond to requests within the legislated 30-day deadline and, in some cases, demanding large fees to release records.</p>
<p>"At the federal, what we're seeing is (government) performances declining year over year, not getting better," said Suzanne Legault, interim federal information commissioner. Her recent report to Parliament warned Canadians' right of access is "at risk of being totally obliterated because delays threaten to render the entire access regime irrelevant."</p>
<p>Saskatchewan scored best among the provinces with a B+ grade. Ontario and B.C. shared the basement with D+ rankings.</p>
<p>Alberta received a C+.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Province passes access-to-info test - Ottawa earns criticism for delays, secrecy</b>
</div><div>By Mary Agnes Welch    </div>

</p>
<p>Manitoba's provincial government earned a B grade in the latest test of Canada's access to information laws, but Ottawa earned criticism for being slower and more secretive than ever.</p>
<p>The City of Winnipeg also earned a B, while Brandon was one of only an handful of cities to get an A+.</p>
<p>Canada-wide, 72 per cent of requests for information earned a response before the 30-day deadline proscribed by legislation. That's up from 63 per cent last year.</p>
<p>Manitoba responded within 30 days 81 per cent of the time. Provincial staff say they are keeping a quarterly tally of their response times in order to promote speed.</p>
<p>But Ottawa, under growing criticism for muzzling civil servants and stalling access to information requests, was notably slower this year, meeting the deadline only half the time.</p>
<p>"This has disturbing implications for access because, as has been said many times, access delayed is access denied," said the report, which echoes recent criticism by the federal information commissioner.</p>
<p>The annual audit, sponsored by the Canadian Newspaper Association, asked federal departments, cities, provinces and universities a series of questions via access to information forms and rated the timeliness and completeness of the responses.</p>
<p>Among the 315 requests for information were copies of federal H1N1 flu plans, the number and cost of cellphones issued to bureaucrats, detailed receipts for trips by politicians and a list of all contracts over $10,000.</p>
<p>Only eight per cent of requests for information in electronic form were granted in full.</p>
<p>Manitoba, which normally scores well in the audit, was singled out for its unwillingness to turn over information in electronic form, such as an Excel spreadsheet that can be searched and sorted. Instead, like many governments, it insisted on photocopying documents that could be more easily sent electronically. For instance, staff at Manitoba Justice insisted on providing paper copies, saying electronic data can be altered.</p>
<p>Sue Bishop, head of the provincial services division of Manitoba Culture Heritage and Tourism, said that's a new issue that access co-ordinators are grappling with. "That's an area where practice will evolve," she said.</p>
<p>maryagnes.welch@freepress.mb.caw</p>
<p>Information audit highlights</p>
<p>The B.C. Ministry of Transportation asked for $98,603 to release staff cellphone costs -- $19,712 for photocopying and $78,750 to find the records.</p>
<p>Every university except the University of Toronto blacked out key financial information in its food and beverage contracts, citing third-party confidentiality, or refused to release the contracts at all.</p>
<p>The CBC asked for more than $20,000 for a list of recent contract under $10,000. Canada Post charged $20 for the same request.</p>
<p>Stonewall, Man., included in the survey for the first time, got an A.</p>

<p>apicard@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>It's been a year since the height of swine flu frenzy – as good a time as any for a post-mortem.</p>
<p>Since the pandemic began last March, there have been 428 deaths and 8,678 hospitalizations in Canada due to influenza A/H1N1. The response has cost more than $2-billion.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it looks like a debacle: A massive amount of money spent on a minor threat.</p>
<p>But hindsight is no way to judge a potential public health disaster.</p>
<p>The real question that needs to be asked is: If the same situation were to arise again today – a novel influenza virus emerging in a country where Canadians travel in large numbers, an illness with a high mortality rate that is killing healthy young adults, spreading out-of-season, and a virus for which a vaccine can be manufactured relatively quickly – what would we do?</p>
<p>One would be hard-pressed to imagine how we could have responded differently, at least on the big-picture issues.</p>
<p>Ordering 50 million doses of vaccine, based on the information available at the time, was the right decision. Promoting universal vaccination and staging emergency flu shot clinics was appropriate. Purchasing additional ventilators because many people might become gravely ill was a smart investment. Calmly telling the public about the potential severity of the threat was a necessity.</p>
<p>Public health officials acquitted themselves pretty well given the scientific and political challenges posed by H1N1. And when you compare the response to H1N1 to that of SARS, it was night and day.</p>
<p>This time around, the response was not only appropriate, it was co-ordinated. Canada had a plan – a pandemic preparedness plan – and it was implemented fairly efficiently in every single province and territory.</p>
<p>With H1N1, unlike SARS, we don't need public inquiries to expose the failures; no one needs to be frog-marched to the guillotine. It's so refreshing to see lessons learned and applied in the health-care field.</p>
<p>Still, there is a lot of second-guessing.</p>
<p>The No. 1 complaint about H1N1 is that public health overreacted to the threat.</p>
<p>The principal argument used to demonstrate this is that swine flu didn't kill many people – only about 18,000 worldwide. Seasonal flu kills a lot more.</p>
<p>But when the most persistent complaint in the wake of a potential disaster is: “Shucks, there was hardly any death and destruction,” then public health officials should feel good at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Everyone's vision is 20-20 in hindsight. Of course the $2-billion spent on pandemic flu could have been better spent – but there was no way of knowing that in advance.</p>
<p>And let's dispense with the conspiracy theories that this was all a ploy to enrich Big Pharma. Sure, drug companies made some money; in the grand scheme of things, it was a trifling amount.</p>
<p>The challenge that public health faced was trying to divine how the H1N1 virus would spread and its impact. The lag time of months needed for production of a vaccine created tremendous pressure to make a decision quickly.</p>
<p>Should we indict public health for being cautious? One would hope not. Had they waited, what would have been the appropriate trigger point for action? 100 dead? 1,000 dead? 10,000? Imagine the outrage.</p>
<p>The behaviour of H1N1 should lead us to rethink one fundamental bit of science, however: The assumption that a pandemic strain of influenza would be far more deadly than a seasonal flu strain.</p>
<p>We know now that isn't the case, and that reality needs to be incorporated into pandemic planning.</p>
<p>A related issue is that there needs to be a better definition of “pandemic” – not the bureaucratic one that exists now. And there needs to be a set of brakes built into the plan. Once governments committed to certain actions – vaccination, clinics, etc. – there seemed to be no easy way to scale back. There needs to be a continuous feedback loop that allows a pull-back when the threat lessens.</p>
<p>We need to recognize, too, that the biggest challenge for public health in the 21st century is communication. The “scandals” that arose were actually communications failures, notably the waffling on who should get vaccinated first (which created long lineups) and failure to explain clearly why an adjuvanted form of vaccine was purchased (which sparked confusion and fear).</p>
<p>H1N1 was the first pandemic of the Internet age; the first pandemic with a 24-hour news cycle; the first pandemic with its own chat groups and listservs; the first pandemic where we could trace the spread of a virus around the globe in real time; the first pandemic influenza virus whose genome we could decode in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>That changed public perceptions of risk – and ratcheted up expectations.</p>
<p>The fact is, despite advances in communications technology, the tools we have for responding to the threat of a potential pandemic remain rather primitive: Vaccines that take months to produce, antivirals of limited use, mucosal swabbing, and a lot of guesswork. And while sticking needles into people is easy, assuaging their fears and answering their questions is a lot more challenging.</p>
<p>The leaders in public health have reason to be proud of their response to H1N1. But their work is not done until they have done a thorough post-mortem. We need to reflect – publicly and insightfully – on what went wrong and what went right and then tweak the pandemic plan and public health responses more generally.</p>
<p>We need to arm ourselves with foresight, not wallow in hindsight.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>City gets high marks for complying with information requests</b>
</div><div>Dave Battagello   </div>
<div>The Windsor Star</div>
<div>805 words</div><div>13 May 2010</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>The city of Windsor was given an A+ for its timely disclosure of information such as employee cellphone costs, Mayor Eddie Francis's travel expenses and municipal land transactions in this year's National Freedom of Information Audit.</p>
<p>The fifth annual exercise conducted by the Canadian Newspaper Association graded FOI responses to uniform requests of information by every level of government, universities and other public bodies across the nation.</p>
<p>The top grade is a dramatic turnaround for Windsor -- it scored a D in the newspaper association's last audit.</p>
<p>"I'm completely surprised," said Chuck Scarpelli, the city's FOI co-ordinator. "We have been aware of that (previous) standing and not pleased. We've been trying in the past year to respect the requests and respond quickly."</p>
<p>The city on average receives about 70 FOI requests per year -- with 10 to 15 per cent going to appeal or requiring a mediator, Scarpelli said.</p>
<p>"I think everybody at city hall wants to give the perception of transparency because we are dealing with taxpayer money," Scarpelli said.</p>
<p>Coun. Alan Halberstadt -- a journalist by trade -- applauded the city's FOI turnaround.</p>
<p>"It's good news and shows perhaps the grading system works," he said.</p>
<p>"Generally what business the city conducts is citizens' business. We are a public company or agency and transparency should be paramount. There are various items that are rightly confidential, but for the most part there should not be a reluctance to provide information."</p>
<p>Windsor was among municipalities across the nation blitzed by the association with the same five inquiries -- staff cellphone use and costs, land transactions, H1N1 flu protocol, expenses on the mayor's latest trip and councillors' attendance at meetings.</p>
<p>Windsor complied by providing full information within two weeks on every request -- with one exception. The city "denied in part" the request for information on its land transactions. That document shows the city did black out several lines -- and according to association officials did not present the information in the format requested.</p>
<p>Information revealed from the association's FOI requests obtained by The Star showed:</p>
<p>- There were 448 wireless devices carried by city staff in 2009 at a total cost of $331,507.06 -- up from $302,148.34 the previous year.</p>
<p>- Mayor Eddie Francis, chief of staff Norma Coleman and airport manager Federica Nazzani travelled on a one-day trip to Washington, D.C., on Dec. 4 in a bid to attract more air cargo business to Windsor. Flight tickets for the three cost $3,049.74, while a lunch receipt paid for by Francis shows they were joined by three others at Tosca restaurant in the U.S. capital with the bill totalling $183.15 and the mayor leaving a $30 tip.</p>
<p>- most land transactions in 2009 were related to expropriation for the Howard Avenue road-rail grade separation project. The most notable transaction was the sale of 92.8 acres in Brighton Beach to the federal government for the new border crossing.</p>
<p>Local resident and blogger Chris Schnurr has continued to fight with the city over an FOI request filed in July 2008 for documents related to the tunnel negotiations with Detroit. The city originally tried to charge him more than $300,000 for the information. The charge has dropped to about $50,000 after he narrowed his request, Schnurr said.</p>
<p>His request is under appeal with an adjudicator and privacy investigators.</p>
<p>"I guess it all comes down to the type of information you are requesting," he said when told of the city's A+ grade. "Based on my experience it would be an F. For residents who request controversial information, this doesn't change the fact we struggle with getting that information.</p>
<p>"But it's a positive start and let's hope it expands. It's great they are learning their lesson and let's see if it continues forward -- like release of information on tunnel negotiations."</p>
<p>The newspaper association said that the most outrageous response among Canadian government agencies came from the B.C. Ministry of Transportation which requested payment of $98,603 before releasing the number of cellphones and costs used by its bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Hind said government secrecy is getting worse -- especially at the federal level.</p>
<p>"When the (Harper) government was first elected we had high hopes and they haven't delivered," he said. "As a government there are longer delays in getting information we have every right to have. It's not a good story.</p>
<p>"We need legislative change and strict penalties for governments who delay. We need a culture where governments recognize they don't own the information -- citizens do."</p>

is difficult to obtain controversial information.   </p>

</p>
<p>Hindsight is a wonderful thing that offers terrific but unfair perspective.</p>
<p>In hindsight, the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health unit shouldn't have thrown everything including the kitchen sink at its response to the H1N1 scare last year. After all, we know now the scare was pretty overblown.</p>
<p>The thing is, in the heat of the H1N1 hysteria, the province and the public were urging health units to do whatever was possible to meet that threat as vigorously and as expeditiously as possible. Any delays or even perceived delays raised public ire and political fire in those early days. That seems so long ago now. Foolish too. Expensive as well.</p>
<p>The costs of that at-all-costs response were somewhat tallied up as the H1N1 campaign drew to a close and the expense of the vaccine and other hard costs emerged.</p>
<p>Now, other costs are surfacing.</p>
<p>It seems our health unit – and likely others – continues to play catch-up on other fronts because of work set aside so resources could be diverted to deliver on the H1N1 front.</p>
<p>It turns out, for example, that food inspections conducted in this area somewhat fell off the to-do list for the health unit as a result of making H1N1 a priority. Even food facilities deemed at highest risk went under-inspected last year. According to information just made public this month – but that's another matter – just a third of these facilities received inspections last year to the frequency standard the health unit regards as acceptable.</p>
<p>Health board chair Lynda Davenport rightly suggested that the area was particularly lucky there wasn't a food-borne outbreak during this resources-starved period.</p>
<p>Of course, perhaps that would have demonstrated the funding limitations of the health unit and the consequences of those political decisions that created such a tight system.</p>
<p>As it is, this was a bullet dodged – pretty inconspicuously.</p>
<p>The health unit suggests it will catch up on its food inspection work. Summer students should help in the effort. Sounds like another economy solution.</p>

<div>686 words</div><div>12 May 2010</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>C2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Crystal Duhaime hopes her first season with the University of Regina Cougars goes better than her last season with the Notre Dame Hounds.</p>
<p>Duhaime, one of four players who have agreed to join the U of R women's hockey team starting in the 2010-11 Canada West season, is coming off a 2009-10 campaign with the midget AAA Hounds that was derailed by a battle with H1N1.</p>
<p>"It affected three people on our hockey team, and I had it the worst," the 17-year-old product of Geraldton, Ont., recalled Tuesday. "I wasn't back on my feet playing hockey for probably 21/2 months ...</p>
<p>"It really affected my respiratory system. I had problems breathing from before (due to asthma, which was diagnosed in March), too. I was really tired and I didn't have much of an appetite. They say it's like the regular flu, but I thought it was much worse. I've never felt like that before."</p>
<p>As she regained her health, Duhaime had to regain her conditioning. The 5-foot-2 forward had to do a lot of off-ice training before returning to practice, and then a lot of practising before returning to the Hounds' lineup in mid-February.</p>
<p>"It wasn't easy sitting and watching the team play," said Duhaime, who was the Hounds' captain. "But that's part of Notre Dame: Struggle and emerge. I just took it day by day."</p>
<p>After returning, Duhaime helped the Hounds capture the Saskatchewan Female Midget AAA Hockey League crown. Notre Dame then played in the Esso Cup national championship tournament and won a silver medal.</p>
<p>As her Grade 12 season slipped by, Duhaime was concerned her bout with H1N1 had hurt her chance of attracting attention from university teams.</p>
<p>"I really thought it was gone," she admitted. "I missed out on two major tournaments Notre Dame had played in (one in Minnesota and one in Wilcox) and that really affected my scouting. Thankfully, the U of R saw me at the Esso Cup, so it all worked out for me."</p>
<p>"She's sound at both ends of the ice," noted Cougars head coach Sarah Howald. "She's a good team player, which is something you don't always get with kids coming out of midget."</p>
<p>Joining Duhaime in the Cougars' recruiting class are forward Chantel Hildebrand and defencemen Laura Olsen and Triston Riemer.</p>
<p>Hildebrand, who hails from Gouldtown, is a product of the SFMAAAHL's Swift Current <span class="companylink">Diamond Energy</span> Wildcats.</p>
<p>"She's not really a flashy forward, but she's going to work all the time and she has some grit," Howald said. "She's somebody that could play a variety of different roles for us."</p>
<p>Olsen is a graduate of her hometown Calgary Chaos of the Alberta Major Midget Female Hockey League. Riemer, a product of White Fox, played for the SFMAAAHL's Prince Albert A&W Bears.</p>
<p>"They can both come in and play right away," Howald said. "(Riemer) has been well-coached. A lot of times, defencemen haven't been taught the defensive skills that they need at this level. We think she's got a lot of those things.</p>
<p>"Laura has more offensive skills right now, but I don't think it'll take her much time to learn the (defensive) skills she'll need."</p>
<p>Because the Cougars had just six defencemen last season -- including converted forward Gina Campbell -- Howald was happy to add two defenders. Up front, the Cougars lost only Kelsie Graham to graduation after the '09-10 season, but have added two forwards.</p>
<p>The math works well for Howald.</p>
<p>"I don't think we have too many," she said. "We had one extra last year. It's not like we had seven kids in the stands. We'll have more options up front and be a little bit deeper.</p>
<p>"We'll miss Kelsie, but I'm pretty excited. We have 12 (forwards) back who are a year older and we're adding two young kids who will push those 12."</p>

</p>
<p>For a number of reasons, it's an unusual spring for agriculture.</p>
<p>Typically, there's a spring moisture shortage somewhere in the province. It was certainly shaping up that way in western areas after a winter with below-normal precipitation. But the rain and snow started falling in early April and hasn't stopped.</p>
<p>Drought has been averted in the west, while eastern regions are suffering with too much moisture. Producers everywhere are hoping for some dry weather so they can get the crop in the ground. It's hard to remember a spring with so much wet weather day after day.</p>
<p>Here's something else unusual. A widely used herbicide has dropped dramatically in price just as its season of use begins. According to farm input suppliers, <span class="companylink">BASF</span> has cut the price of Pursuit herbicide by $350 a jug. The price has been running at nearly $1,100 for a 3.3-litre container, so a $350-cut is big.</p>
<p>Pursuit is coming into Canada from the U.S. under GROU, the Grower Requested Own Use program. Producers using the GROU program are still going to end up with a lower price, but the gap has been significantly narrowed now that <span class="companylink">BASF</span> has cut the Canadian price.</p>
<p>GROU has proven to be useful for all Canadian growers, whether or not they actually participate. Another company is working to bring a generic Pursuit to Canadian growers for next year. If that happens, there should be price competition from more than just the GROU program.</p>
<p>Farm input suppliers says <span class="companylink">BASF</span> has also cut the price on a number of its other key products.</p>
<p>Here's another surprise. Hog producers are making money.</p>
<p>A year ago, a promising rally in hog prices was wiped out by H1N1 being inappropriately labelled swine flu. Now, after three years of punishing losses, hog prices are back into profitable territory and that is expected to last into the months ahead.</p>
<p>For a change, most of the major market factors are favourable. U.S. pork exports overseas have increased and there's less pork in cold storage.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the years of low prices have taken a toll. The Canadian breeding herd has declined by nearly 20 per cent since peaking in 2005. As of April 1, the Saskatchewan breeding herd was only 85,200 head, down nearly 12 per cent from a year ago and down 35 per cent from its peak in 2005.</p>
<p>While hog numbers have crashed, Alberta cattle feedlots are showing more interest in Saskatchewan than ever before.</p>
<p>Namaka Enterprises, a large feedlot operation from southern Alberta, has announced its intentions to set up a Saskatchewan operation southeast of Outlook in the southern end of the South Saskatchewan Irrigation District. Ultimately, the plan is for a 36,000-head feedlot, which would make it the largest in the province.</p>
<p>Local sources say Namaka has been securing land in the area for quite some time. There are concerns over the proposal, one of which is the proximity of the operation to the main irrigation canal. The rural municipality has scheduled a meeting for June 17 to present the feedlot proposal to the public and listen to feedback.</p>
<p>If it goes ahead, this Namaka feedlot would be a bit bigger than the Pound-Maker feedlot at Lanigan. Pound-Maker has been a great asset for that entire region, but how an intensive livestock operation is managed determines whether it's a good corporate citizen.</p>
<p>Another Alberta feedlot owner, Cor Van Raay has purchased a big block of land near Conquest. Many observers assume a feedlot is being planned for that area as well, but no intentions have been announced.</p>
<p>So far, it's been a year with a lot of surprises. Makes one wonder what's in store for the months ahead.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ash fallout: Cheaper airfares to Europe?; Prices may drop to lure travellers</b>
</div><div>Jim Buchta   </div>
<div>Star Tribune</div>
<div>436 words</div><div>11 May 2010</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A25</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano may have quieted for now, but that doesn't mean it's done impacting travel. Along with an ash plume, the eruption may bring about cheaper summer airfares to Europe.</p>
<p>"We are guessing that a certain percentage of the population who were planning a trip to Europe are going to stay home instead, not wanting to play ash-cloud roulette with Mother Nature," said George Hobica, founder of airfare-watchdog.com.</p>
<p>A decline in the number of travellers to Europe could force airlines to cut fares, which have been rising as business and leisure travel rebounds.</p>
<p>According to Bing Travel's recently released Summer Travel Forecast, summer airfares to Europe were expected to rise 29 per cent over last summer. Fares to Europe this summer are running $1,270 on average, compared to $902 last summer.</p>
<p>That upward trend may reverse depending on how many travellers decide to forgo a visit to Europe, which relies heavily on the airspace over Iceland for many popular routes. In Iceland itself, the airport wasn't hit as hard as those in parts of Europe because the ash clouds blew quickly away from it towards northern Europe and Scandinavia.</p>
<p>Hobica has been polling travellers about their summer plans and preliminary results show that about 15 per cent say that they expect to change their travel plans to Europe.</p>
<p>"Even a 15-per-cent change of heart will have a downward effect, or at least keep fares from rising further," Hobica said, adding that the impact of volcano worries are akin to those of SARS and the H1N1 scare.</p>
<p>Tom Parsons, CEO of Bestfares.com,agrees. In a weekly analysis of airfare trends he said that in the wake of the SARS and H1N1 scares, it took airlines three to four weeks to adjust fares based on consumer response.</p>
<p>"We think the same may hold true for the volcanic ash incident in Europe," Parsons wrote. "The airlines are sitting on the sideline right now, hoping that you will pay $1,500 for a ticket to Europe for summer 2010."</p>
<p>His advice? Wait it out and see what happens in the next few weeks. If airfares to Europe don't drop any further for summer, fly to Europe in September or October when airfares tend to be as much as $500 off summer prices.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The fantastic Mr. Pallett</b>
</div><div>Mike Devlin   </div>

<div>790 words</div><div>8 May 2010</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Owen Pallett has a list of loves that often worm their way into his interviews.</p>
<p>He's known for bringing attention to works of art otherwise unknown in mainstream circles (for example, the New York duo Sleigh Bells), or professing his love for something that despite being well understood might warrant a second look (Mariah Carey).</p>
<p>For journalists, Pallett, 30, is more of a taskmaster than tastemaker. His press interviews can be wild rides, but only if you can stay on course.</p>
<p>He'll call your bluff if you don't know your stuff, and isn't going to suffer fools gladly. Precocious? Perhaps a little bit. That said, the play-everything wunderkind from Milton, Ont., who developed an affinity for the violin at age three, is anything but boring.</p>
<p>Pallett graduated in 2002 with a degree in music composition from the University of Toronto, which gave his in-progress career further traction.</p>
<p>He balanced for-hire projects as a session violinist and string arranger for a period, eventually embarking on his own in 2005 with Has a Good Home, his debut under the Final Fantasy moniker.</p>
<p>After many more Final Fantasy releases, a Polaris Prize win, and accolades too many to mention, Pallett gave up his stage name and released Heartland, his debut solo album from earlier this year.</p>
<p>No matter the project, Pallett has always worked in reverse. He edits and reworks material in the live setting before entering the studio, in part due to the fact that he has no band to bounce ideas off of.</p>
<p>"This project began as a live thing. For a while, the records were me trying to figure out a way of making records. Duplicating what I did live or even adapting what I did live was not necessarily going to make for good listening."</p>
<p>Pallett developed for Heartland a wealth of new material, though not all of it transferred well to the studio. "There were some real turds," he said.</p>
<p>"Some of it sounded so good live, but sounded like garbage in the studio."</p>
<p>He has always had difficulty transferring songs that germinate in the live arena to the recorded medium. The songs "Hey Dad" and "What Do You Think Will Happen Next?", which were released as a vinyl single in 2007, existed for years solely in the live setting, despite being written in 2004.</p>
<p>"It took three years to actually figure out how I was going to lay them down," Pallett said.</p>
<p>Technologically speaking, only in this day and age could Pallett exist. His live concerts, which of late have included support from percussionist Thomas Gill, are "live looping" exercises, as Pallett puts it, that make expansive use of a keyboard outfitted to record and play samples of Pallett's voice and violin.</p>
<p>While technology made it easier to construct records like Heartland -- on which Pallett used a mixture of analog and digital techniques to tell the story of an "ultraviolent farmer" named Lewis under the command of a deity-like narrator named Owen -- the options were endless. Almost to a fault.</p>
<p>"I love the luxuries that digital technology will afford you. Certain aspects of it that were recorded in analog were easy, and aspects that were recorded in digital allowed for a lot of options but presented other problems."</p>
<p>Pallett was presented with a major problem in September of last year. Hours prior to his anticipated opening night performance at Victoria's Rifflandia Festival, he fell seriously ill. Pallett cancelled his appearance at the request of a Victoria nurse who feared he might have contracted the H1N1 virus (he was eventually diagnosed as having the flu and strep throat simultaneously).</p>
<p>"I don't want to over-egg the brulee or anything, but I thought I was going to die," Pallett said of the incident, which also caused the cancellation of a Vancouver performance. "It was a pretty nasty, horrible situation."</p>
<p>The tour has been getting rave reviews and American audiences have been ecstatic, particularly when Pallett provides some levity with his infamous cover of Mariah Carey's "Fantasy."</p>
<p>Though he seemed nonplussed about discussing it, Pallett said his decision to tackle the pop hit was one of pride.</p>
<p>"It's something I did once that got a lot of hits on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>. I first did it in 2006, and it got picked up by a couple of blogs who thought it was a terrible cover. It made me feel bad because I could actually do it. I've been doing it fairly regularly since then to show that I can actually do that song."</p>

<p>The Group of 20 might now be the premier forum for international economic policy co-ordination, but the Group of Seven still see itself as the fire brigade.</p>
<p>Canada’s Jim Flaherty, the current chair of the club of rich country finance ministers and central bank chiefs, convened an emergency conference call with G7 counterparts at about 8 a.m. Ottawa time. For those of you who have forgotten already, the G7 also includes the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France and Italy.</p>
<p>The agenda is obvious to anyone who glanced at the financial news Friday morning.</p>
<p>Europe’s economic malaise is spreading around the globe faster than swine flu. Stocks and commodities plunged on concern European leaders’ inability to limit their fiscal crisis to Greece will end up choking the global recovery. The Bank of Japan said it will pump 2-trillion yen -- about $22-billion (U.S.) -- into the financial system in an attempt to maintain orderly markets.</p>
<p>“All the financial markets are now in turmoil,” Japan’s vice finance minister, Rintaro Tamaki, told Bloomberg News in an interview. “The impact of the Greek crisis has gone beyond the border of the euro area. This is a global issue.”</p>
<p>Mr. Flaherty likes to tell the story of the G7 meeting held in Washington in October 2008 at the height of the crisis. As he and his colleagues gathered in a gilded meeting room at the United States Treasury on a Friday, they were uncertain banks would open the following Monday. Mr. Flaherty calls this meeting a turning point in the crisis. Ministers and central bankers threw away their prepared statement and drafted a new one-page plan that became the template for the international response to the crisis. But before the all-for-one resolve, there was much acrimony directed at then Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson for allowing Lehman Brothers to fail. Mr. Flaherty never says explicitly, but his audiences get the hint that it was the Europeans who were doing the finger pointing.</p>
<p>Wonder where the acrimony is being directed on this morning’s call?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>We were aiming to be prudent, EMSB says of high H1N1 tally; Expense report; Leave for pregnant staff largest cost for boards</b>
</div><div>BRENDA BRANSWELL   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>775 words</div><div>7 May 2010</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>How much does it cost to try to ward off a pandemic in a setting where the spread of influenza can pick up steam?</p>
<p>That depends on which school board you're talking about.</p>
<p>The English Montreal School Board, which has 36,000 students, outspent the four other Montreal Island boards by a wide margin in dealing with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>In an expense report to Quebec's Education Department, the EMSB listed $592,640 in H1N1-related expenses between the end of April 2009 and Nov. 30.</p>
<p>That's more than double what the Lester B. Pearson School Board, which has 32,000 students, spent during the same time frame. Its H1N1 tab came to $280,997.</p>
<p>The EMSB tally also is more than the $461,307 shelled out to date by the Commission scolaire de Montréal, the province's largest school board with nearly 110,000 students.</p>
<p>Why such a big discrepancy? Did the EMSB go overboard in trying to be vigilant or was it the best prepared among Montreal Island boards to deal with a pandemic that ultimately resulted in mostly mild illness?</p>
<p>Robert Stocker, the board's deputy director-general, said he believes the board's approach was prudent.</p>
<p>"I think we just chose to take a certain strategy that was mitigating the risk as much as possible," Stocker said.</p>
<p>"That's why we decided we don't know how big this thing is going to be and we don't want to have our actions second-guessed later on. So it's better to err on the side of caution."</p>
<p>The board chose to equip its schools with what it hoped was an appropriate amount of equipment, he said.</p>
<p>The board spent $214,074 on items such as hand-sanitizer dispensers and antiseptic cleanser.</p>
<p>Dispensers were placed at entrances in schools and centres for visitors to use.</p>
<p>"We wanted to capture particularly visitors," Stocker said.</p>
<p>"The challenge is always to maintain essential services," even in the event of an extremely serious pandemic, he said.</p>
<p>The EMSB costs included special training sessions for school caretakers. A "small portion" of its $68,941 expense for supplies, materials and equipment included costs incurred from Hour-Zero Crisis Consulting Ltd., an Alberta-based firm that helped the board with its emergency preparedness program. The company ran H1N1 workshops for EMSB administrators.</p>
<p>Figures provided to The Gazette by the five school boards included amounts spent on transporting students to vaccination centres. A large portion of the boards' pandemic expenses involved pregnant staff who went on preventive leave as a precaution. School boards were required to pay for the first five days of a staff member's leave with the balance covered by the Commission de la santé et de la sécurité du travail du Québec, the workers' compensation board. At the CSDM that translated into $170,156.</p>
<p>The Commission scolaire Marguerite Bourgeoys, whose territory includes the West Island, submitted the lowest expense report among the Montreal Island boards. The bulk of its $151,740 tally was for preventive leave for pregnant staff. The Commission scolaire de la Pointe de l'Île spent $155,795.</p>
<p>A pandemic is unpredictable and "you really don't know what you're facing," said Pierre-Paul Tellier, a physician and director of student health at McGill University.</p>
<p>"I think that we were lucky," said Tellier, who sat on the university's H1N1 planning committee.</p>
<p>If it had been the way that it was described, Tellier said, "I think we would have all been in trouble. We weren't yet ready for the big impact - the big one."</p>
<p>"I don't think we're alone in that. I think everybody would have been in that same situation and I think people who don't recognize that are foolish."</p>
<p>The two waves of the H1N1 virus cost the Education Department and school network - including CEGEPS and universities - about $11 million, said Tamara Davis, a spokesperson for Education Minister Michelle Courchesne.</p>
<p>A few board officials said they still haven't received a guarantee from Quebec that it will pick up the H1N1 tab.</p>
<p>Asked whether all expenses will be approved, Davis said the Education Department would wait to get all the information from school boards. "We've already let everybody know that we were there to help the school network in any way we can," she said. "And we're going to evaluate that once we get all their costs in."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Food safety inspections curtailed during H1N1 scare</b>
</div><div>Vik Kirsch   </div>
<div>Mercury Staff</div>
<div>507 words</div><div>7 May 2010</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>FERGUS</p>
<p>Restaurant and related inspections plummeted last fall as Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health focused on the threat of an H1N1 flu pandemic, its board of directors heard this week.</p>
<p>Luckily, there wasn't a food-borne outbreak during that difficult time, board chair Lynda Davenport said at a meeting of the board Wednesday.</p>
<p>But she was clearly irked that the board had to scramble to keep up with the flu threat while carrying out its regular inspection work, which strained resources greatly. She offered to write the government at Queen's Park for more resources should another threat like H1N1 arise.</p>
<p>Board member Maggie Laidlaw, a Guelph city councillor, supported that suggestion.</p>
<p>Laidlaw wasn't pleased health authorities had to scramble to offer protection, which included a mass vaccination program, against a perceived pandemic "that didn't turn out to be that way."</p>
<p>Davenport said the public health board had no choice but to throw resources at H1N1, which began in Mexico and the U.S. but spread to other countries.</p>
<p>"When the World Health Organization declares it (a pandemic), we have to follow," Davenport said. Inspections are carried out based on perceived risk. Some facilities get one inspection a year, others require two and those deemed the highest risk are given three.</p>
<p>Medical officer of health Dr. Nicola Mercer presented a report that noted her public health board completed only a third of its three-times annual inspections for facilities considered the highest risk. That's down from 79 per cent the year before, when H1N1 wasn't a significant concern.</p>
<p>That was mitigated somewhat by the fact the partial completion rate for high-risk premises, in which two of three inspections were done, was 87 per cent, compared with 96 the year before. The report didn't state the actual number of inspections done.</p>
<p>But it does note the health board contended not only with the H1N1 threat, but budget constraints and training required for a new electronic inspection database system.</p>
<p>In all, Guelph-area residents received 97,000 doses of the H1N1 flu vaccine through the fall and winter, protecting 60 to 70 per cent of the region's population, a massive proactive effort.</p>
<p>"We did take people away from the food safety inspections," Laidlaw said, adding some critics contend the H1N1 threat was overblown.</p>
<p>"Hindsight's 20/20," Laidlaw said.</p>
<p>Board member John Green concluded preparing for a potential threat is not an exact science.</p>
<p>"It's hard to budget for exceptions," Green said.</p>
<p>Davenport suggested employees did the best they could under difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>"I feel we should support the staff," Davenport said.</p>
<p>If there was a problem, it was "a shortfall in our capacity," Davenport said, laying the limited resources available to the public health board at the feet of Queen's Park.</p>
<p>Mercer said the inspection situation should improve soon because her public health board will be hiring four summer students, up from two the previous summer.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's patch misuse can lead to OD or death</p>
<p>Health Canada and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada are warning against misuse of a drug patch for an Alzheimer's medication.</p>
<p>They say people have overdosed and even died after using the Exelon Patch in the wrong way.</p>
<p>They are reminding doctors and patients to remove one patch before applying a new one to a different location on the back, upper arm or chest. And they are stressing that the patches should be used whole, not cut into pieces.</p>
<p>Health Canada says three cases of medication error or misuse of the product have been reported in this country involving the Exelon Patch. There have been two reported cases of death due to medication error or misuse worldwide.</p>

<p>No docked marks for turning in a school assignment late?</p>
<p>Maybe not for much longer, kids.</p>
<p>"Those are life skills -- we expect papers to be handed in on time," Education Minister Nancy Allan said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Allan said the province will soon have serious talks with teachers and superintendents to look at a 13-year-old policy that tells schools they shouldn't dock marks for late assignments, attitude, or tardiness.</p>
<p>It was former Tory education minister Linda McIntosh who introduced the guidelines, Allan said. McIntosh wanted marks to reflect how well students knew the material, not whether they'd handed it in on time, or written a makeup test, or been consistently late for class.</p>
<p>Allan acknowledged her NDP predecessor, Peter Bjornson, reinforced those guidelines in a letter to school divisions last June.</p>
<p>"That's correct, Peter did, minister Bjornson did, absolutely," said Allan.</p>
<p>But that was then, this is now, and Allan certainly has heard a lot of reaction from Manitobans who want students to get used to the demands of the real world they'll enter after graduation.</p>
<p>"We live in a world" in which students will have employers who expect them to be on time and meet deadlines, she said. "We've had a look at it -- it's an old policy. We believe we need to provide some clarity around that."</p>
<p>Allan said she's aware the Manitoba Teachers' Society will receive a report later this month on teacher workload -- partly driven by the extra time teachers take to mark assignments that are weeks overdue, or to create a make-up test or new assignments for students who'd failed or never even got around to doing an assignment.</p>
<p>"We'll be working in partnership with them. The big picture is, how do we support students?" Allan said.</p>
<p>Allan said she's not prepared to say how finely detailed any government policy or directive would be, such as specifying how many marks come off each day or week for late assignments.</p>
<p>The minister also said a review of school attendance, and strategies to track and reduce absence, is getting back on track after being sidetracked by the need to deal with H1N1 in the fall.</p>
<p>On the other hand, said Allan, while the province is looking at the so-called no-fail or social promotion approaches in many school divisions, don't expect any provincial action soon.</p>
<p>No-fail sees students remain with their social group and advance regardless of marks. There is no carved-in-stone provincial policy.</p>
<p>No-fail and social promotion have been getting lumped in with the "accurate grading issue" of late assignments, she said: "They complement one another, but they're quite different."</p>
<p>Tory education critic Cliff Cullen (Turtle Mountain) said it's time Allan made the government's position clear on no-fail and other grading and promotion issues.</p>
<p>"It's a mixed bag out there," Cullen said. "She wouldn't give us a date of when this was going to happen, or how it's to roll out."</p>

<div>REPORT / IMMUNIZATION RATES</div>

<p>A growing number of parents are delaying or outright refusing to immunize their children, a troubling trend experts fear will cause future outbreaks of preventable diseases, such as measles, mumps, and even polio.</p>
<p>Figures released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at a pediatrics conference in Vancouver this week confirm that fewer parents are keeping their toddlers up to date on their vaccines.</p>
<p>Researchers found that 39 per cent of parents refused or delayed at least one vaccine for their child in 2008, compared to just 22 per cent in 2003. The findings are based on data collected from nearly 9,000 U.S. children between 19 and 35 months old that were included in the CDC's 2008 national immunization survey.</p>
<p>“[The numbers] were higher than I would have thought,” Lance Rodewald, director of the CDC's Immunization Services Division, said in an interview.</p>
<p>It's a serious issue that could have grave consequences. As vaccination rates begin to drop, risks of disease re-emergence start to increase because the population no longer has “herd immunity.” For instance, when whooping cough vaccination rates dropped in Britain in 1974, it led to an outbreak that eventually killed 36 people, according to Health Canada.</p>
<p>There are no national standards for collecting or reporting immunization rates in Canada. Although the Public Health Agency of Canada does collect information from local and provincial governments, it says it's difficult to get a clear picture of vaccination rates because of inconsistent data-collection methods and other challenges. Some experts say immunization rates are high across Canada, but there is concern that the backlash against vaccines in recent years may undermine public health efforts.</p>
<p>It's recommended that children receive a variety of vaccines in their first few years of life, such as diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis (polio), mumps, measles, rubella and haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccines.</p>
<p>Some may be administered a few times over the course of months or years.</p>
<p>The introduction of these kinds of vaccines has helped to significantly reduce the occurrence of illness and disease. For instance, before the polio vaccine was introduced in Canada in 1955, the disease was fairly widespread and caused thousands of cases of irreversible paralysis.</p>
<p>Although misconceptions about the link between vaccines and autism and fears over side effects have become more widespread, particularly during the H1N1 pandemic, those concerns only partly explain the growing reluctance to immunize. Researchers found that 44 per cent of parents in the study who delayed or refused shots did so because their child was ill. Parents were allowed to give more than one reason in the survey.</p>
<p>Dr. Rodewald said it's usually safe for children to be vaccinated if they have a mild illness, but many doctors and parents prefer to avoid it. The problem is that parents may forget to bring the child back for the shot, and the child can be at risk of contracting a disease later in life, Dr. Rodewald said.</p>
<p>More troubling are the numbers of parents who reported safety fears: Nearly 30 per cent said they delayed or refused immunization because they thought too many shots were being recommended, while 26 per cent said they questioned the effectiveness of vaccines. Another 24 per cent said they had concerns over vaccine side effects or safety.</p>
<p>But perhaps most disconcerting is that one-quarter of parents said they were avoiding vaccines because of fears over their link to autism, a misconception that is proving to be one of the biggest challenges in keeping population-wide immunization rates high.</p>
<p>The link between autism and the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was reported in a study published in prestigious medical journal The Lancet in 1998. It was based on 12 children and relied heavily on the parents' memory of events following vaccination to reach its conclusions. Many of the families were involved in a class-action lawsuit against the vaccine makers.</p>
<p>The study was formally retracted by The Lancet last February, but many say the damage is extremely difficult to repair.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the study's publication, MMR vaccination rates dropped, particularly in Britain, and led to outbreaks of illness in that country, including some cases that were fatal. Sporadic outbreaks of measles, mumps and rubella have occurred across Canada in recent years.</p>
<p>It's difficult to prove whether or not vaccine fears are leading to lower immunization rates and causing Canadians to be vulnerable to these preventable diseases.</p>
<p>But experts say recent outbreaks demonstrate the serious consequences of snubbing vaccines.</p>
<p>Communicating those risks to parents is a challenge, however, because most don't recognize the potential for vaccine-preventable diseases to re-emerge, said Allison McGeer director of infection control at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>“I think it's a really significant issue,” Dr. McGeer said. “We're well into a generation of parents who have not seen these diseases. … As a parent, you don't get a sense of threat about these diseases, and that makes vaccine safety much more important.”</p>

</p>
<p>With the H1N1 flu pandemic all but forgotten, the World Health Organization is at last freed up to address a more serious health risk, namely venomous snakes. About 100,000 people die every year from snakebites, which is 84,000 more than were claimed worldwide by the flu pandemic. So we really are dealing with a snakedemic order of magnitude worse than the flu pandemic that everyone got so excited about.</p>
<p>Snakebite victims could hardly be blamed for resenting all the frantic attention devoted to the flu:</p>
<p>"Help me! I've been bitten by a cobra!"</p>
<p>"Sorry, sir, you'll have to wait. Can't you see there are people ahead of you with headaches and runny noses."</p>
<p>". . . so cold . . . so cold . . ."</p>
<p>Now, with the H1N1 pandemic revealed as a relatively minor malady, health authorities can pay a little more attention to the snakebit. In an effort to reduce snakebite mortality, the WHO this week launched a website devoted to identifying venomous snakes and providing information for species-appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>A different kind of anti-venom apparently is required depending on whether he was bitten by a Guatemalan jumping pit viper, for example, or a rough-scaled death adder. The website catalogues more than 600 venomous snake species, with their geographic distributions, colour images and species-specific treatment regimes. Victims can thus be shown pictures to identify the snake that bit them, rather as street crime victims are shown mug shots:</p>
<p>"Was it this one?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"This one?</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"This one?"</p>
<p>". . . so cold . . .so cold . . ."</p>
<p>Quick thinking by the victim can take all the guesswork out of it. A South African doctor now working in Saskatchewan once told me that, in Africa, snakebite victims often came into his clinic with a dead snake in a bag, saying, "This is the snake that bit me." This is something we don't often see at the neighbourhood doc-in-a-box.</p>
<p>Blessedly, we don't see any venomous snakes around here at all. There are a few, scattered rattlesnakes slithering across the grasslands of southern Saskatchewan, but the parkland around Saskatoon is pretty much venomous snake-free. This is exactly the kind of natural advantage we should promote. We should erect big signs on highways coming into the area, declaring:</p>
<p>You are now entering a venomous snake-free zone.</p>
<p>ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SIGN, IT WOULD SAY:</p>
<p>You are now leaving a venomous snake free zone.</p>
<p>Why would you want to do that?</p>
<p>We take too much for granted the benefits of living in a venomous snake-free zone. We don't fully appreciate how lucky we are to go out the door in the morning without having to worry about stepping on an inland taipan, say, an Australian species that grows up to eight feet long and is reputed to be the deadliest of venomous snakes. One bite from a taipan is said to be the equivalent of 200 rattlesnake bites. So you can get 199 rattlesnake bites and still say, "It could have been worse."</p>
<p>Here, the relative lethality of venomous snakes is not a big issue. Unlike a lot of people elsewhere in the world, we don't have to worry about a 12-foot-long African green mamba slithering into the house through a screen door carelessly left ajar. A green mamba is reportedly powerful enough to rear up and bite you in the face. I can think of no better reason to live in a venomous snake-free zone.</p>
<p>Another good reason is the bahia lancehead, a deadly South American species. Consider the list of symptoms when someone is bitten by a bahia lancehead: Burning pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, headache, massive swelling of the bitten extremity, hemorrhagic blebs, local necrosis, bleeding from the nose and gums, internal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, runaway heartbeat, kidney failure and shock. And we were all worried here about the flu.</p>
<p>Our good fortune is illustrated by a map on the WHO's new website showing in pink all the areas of the world where venomous snakes reside. Almost the entire map is pink, and what isn't pink is mostly covered in ice. There's just a narrow inhabitable band between the barren arctic and a world of venomous snakes. Why would anyone want to be anywhere else?</p>

</div><div>Vik Kirsch   </div>
<div>Mercury Staff</div>
<div>457 words</div><div>5 May 2010</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>When Guelph General Hospital staff cut a cake Wednesday, their hands are likely to be clean, judging by significant improvements in hygiene.</p>
<p>"I'm the happiest with the fact our staff worked so hard this year (on hand hygiene)," hospital quality and professional practice director Melissa Skinner said Tuesday. Administration is acknowledging the achievement with a celebratory cake "to keep this a very positive approach," she added.</p>
<p>She's hopeful this will spur continued success in future.</p>
<p>"The issue is sustaining the results," Skinner said.</p>
<p>Over the past year ending March 31, hand hygiene rates among staff were 65 per cent before contact with patients and 88 per cent after. That's up dramatically from 45 and 67 per cent, respectively, the year before.</p>
<p>Good hygiene is considered critically important in a hospital setting for discouraging the spread of potentially harmful microscopic organisms like C. difficile, VRE and the H1N1 flu, common pathogens in the environment.</p>
<p>The provincial hand hygiene compliance averages were 66 and 79 per cent respectively this year.</p>
<p>Skinner said her hospital's staff came up with initiatives like increasing the number of places where sanitary gels were available in patient and public areas, based on where this "made the most sense."</p>
<p>Staff also encouraged each other to participate more and include such pep talks in meetings.</p>
<p>"They took the results very seriously," Skinner said. "This is reflective of their hard work. We know hand hygiene is the number one thing staff can do to cut down on any (harmful organism) transmission."</p>
<p>Groves Memorial Community Hospital in Fergus also saw a dramatic improvement to 80 and 87 per cent respectively from 35 and 74 per cent the previous year. Board chair Gord Feniak said directors stayed focused on hygiene through a committee on safety and quality improvements.</p>
<p>"That committee took a great interest," Feniak said. It led in part to staff training reinforced with frequent reminders, and the fostering of a workplace culture stressing cleanliness.</p>
<p>"It's the target we set. We're very happy with the result," the chair said.</p>
<p>Cambridge Memorial also boasted impressive statistics: 79 and 88, respectively, this year. Kitchener's Grand River Hospital had more modest numbers, 47 and 70, respectively. St. Mary's echoed that at 46 and 66.</p>
<p>Guelph's Skinner stressed staff won't be resting on their hands. "We're going to keep aiming for 100 per cent," she said.</p>
<p>Hand hygiene statistics are based on the rates at which hospital health care workers clean their hands before and after contact with patients and the patient environment.</p>
<p>They can sanitize their hands with disinfectant cleaners or by washing diligently with soap and water.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Improving world's health by inviting Taiwan to the table</b>
</div><div>Yaung Chih-Liang   </div>
<div>For The Calgary Herald</div>
<div>639 words</div><div>5 May 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Following years of effort, Taiwan was finally seated as an observer at the World Health Assembly in 2009 and has been invited to attend again this year.</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the kind words of support from the editorial writers at the Calgary Herald who have supported our bid for World Health Organization participation over the years.</p>
<p>Taiwanese experts have taken part in four WHO technical meetings so far this year. This has given us access to first-hand information concerning disease prevention and control methods used around the world as well as health issues affecting other countries. WHO participation is not only invaluable for use in crafting our national health policy, it also enhances our ability to engage in bilateral health co-operation.</p>
<p>With our Centers for Disease Control (CDC) now a party to the WHO's International Health Regulations, we no longer suffer from a dearth of information. During the 2009 outbreak of a new H1N1 influenza virus, Taiwan obtained a wealth of timely, relevant information and virus samples from the WHO. For our part, we have helped create a more complete global health network by reporting dozens of confirmed cases of H1N1 to the WHO and cooperating with other nations to fight this disease.</p>
<p>Taiwan has striven to reciprocate the goodwill of the international community. For instance, we have offered to donate locally produced H1N1 vaccines valued at $5 million US. Also, when Haiti was struck by a major earthquake earlier this year, we immediately dispatched medical supplies and medical teams to help with relief work.</p>
<p>Our contributions include treating over 2,500 individuals, providing materials and funding worth $16 million US and donating 1,200 emergency housing units.</p>
<p>World Vision Taiwan, a non-governmental organization, will be able to support more than 8,000 homeless children and orphans in Haiti with the funds it has raised.</p>
<p>Taking part in WHO activities is of great significance in our work to safeguard our people's lives and safety. As things now stand, however, we must submit an application each time we wish to attend a WHO meeting. Also, the WHO only provides us with limited notice of these events, severely inhibiting our ability to take part. We call on the global health body to simplify its application procedures and provide us with more information on its meetings.</p>
<p>Taiwan is seeking to expand its participation in WHO meetings, mechanisms and activities as well, especially regarding the Western Pacific Regional Office and International Food Safety Authorities Network.</p>
<p>Located in the Asia-Pacific region, Taiwan has frequent contact with nations that are under the auspices of the Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO). As work to prevent the spread of disease in the region affects all of these countries, our absence from the WPRO is regrettable.</p>
<p>Given that the global community has been increasingly concerned with food safety, in January 2010, we established the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA). We are looking for the TFDA to be invited to participate in the International Food Safety Authorities Network using the model employed to have Taiwan's CDC become a party to the IHR, as this would help ensure food safety for our 23 million people and people of other countries.</p>
<p>Taiwan will continue to comply with international norms and co-operate with WHO member states in contributing to the international community, and we hope that the WHO and its member states will support the above requests for us to better serve the health needs of all.</p>
<p>Again, we thank the Calgary Herald for its long-term support and look forward to deeper co-operation between Taiwan and Canada.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Diane Deans won't vie for mayor's chair this fall; Too many issues cast shadow on current council, councillor says</b>
</div><div>Joanne Chianello   </div>

</p>
<p>Councillor Diane Deans this week ended speculation that she might run for mayor, saying she would not want to run on the record of this term of council.</p>
<p>"There's been an erosion of faith in this council by the public," said the Gloucester-Southgate councillor, who has had the job since 1994. "This is not the term of council that I've been most proud of. I own my share of it because I am part of council, but I have not voted for the issues that have cast a shadow the whole term."</p>
<p>Deans said the cancellation of the light-rail project approved under former mayor Bob Chiarelli not only cost taxpayers almost $37 million, but also "set the city back years." (It would have served her ward particularly well.) The cancellation passed by only one vote of council and, according to Deans, some councillors say privately that they now wish they had voted differently.</p>
<p>And while she's looking forward to seeing the final designs for the Lansdowne redevelopment, Deans said she has not supported the process or any plans that she's seen so far.</p>
<p>"We got off on the wrong track with Lansdowne," she said of the bid from Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group that interrupted an international design competition to redevelop the site. "Lansdowne is one of the city's great public spaces and it should be a community meeting place. What I've see to date comes nowhere near that."</p>
<p>It hasn't all been awful -- for example, Deans is proud of the city's response to the H1N1 crisis, which she was instrumental in organizing -- but the councillor feels Ottawa has fallen behind other forward-looking cities, such as Vancouver, in several areas, including "a renewed vision for public spaces."</p>
<p>But instead of trying to change the city's direction from the biggest chair, Deans is planning to run again in her ward, something she said her constituents have asked her to do.</p>
<p>"It's not all about me," she said. Although Deans said she'd like to run for mayor at some point, "I love what I do and I take pride in the work I do."</p>
<p>But running for mayor is a "tricky business," she said.</p>
<p>One of the trickiest parts is the money -- mounting a mayoral campaign costs at least $400,000, an amount many people find hard to raise, including Councillor Peter Hume, who cited the problem as one of the reasons he decided against throwing his hat into the ring.</p>
<p>A sitting councillor has even more to lose than just the mayoral race -- he or she must give up his or her seat in order to run for the top job. Deans would have been running against fellow Councillor Alex Cullen, whose campaign has so far been low-key, and former cabinet minister and pre-amalgamation mayor Jim Watson.</p>
<p>Mayor Larry O'Brien has said he'll announce next month his decision on whether he'll run.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tenth victim dies in Victoria care-home outbreak; Respiratory ailment claims another frail senior after 21 residents at Glengarry Hospital fall ill since April 22</b>
</div><div>WENDY STUECK   </div>

</p>
<p>A 10th person has died in an outbreak of an unidentified respiratory illness at Glengarry Hospital, a residential care home in Victoria.</p>
<p>An elderly man died over the weekend after having been identified as displaying symptoms consistent with the outbreak, Vancouver Island Health Authority spokeswoman Shannon Marshall said Monday.</p>
<p>The man was among three hospital residents that VIHA had been monitoring for respiratory symptoms late last week. Of those three people, one turned out not to have the illness and another has recovered.</p>
<p>The man who died “was a very frail and elderly gentleman who'd had some challenges in aspirating in recent weeks,” Ms. Marshall said.</p>
<p>All 10 people who died in the outbreak were frail and elderly, ranging in age from 81 to 97, and several had dementia.</p>
<p>VIHA announced the outbreak April 22. Some patients had been having respiratory problems, such as coughing and runny noses, since the end of March. But those symptoms at first seemed connected to a norovirus outbreak at the facility that was identified at the beginning of April. After an increase in the number of cases, and several deaths, VIHA announced the respiratory illness outbreak.</p>
<p>To date, the outbreak has affected 21 residents. While 10 have died, the rest are “resolved or improving,” Ms. Marshall said. Three staff members have also been confirmed as meeting the case definition for the outbreak.</p>
<p>“There are a number of viruses circulating in the community, with respiratory illnesses, and while most of those wouldn't cause any sort of serious illness in healthy adults, they can have a serious impact on frail, elderly people, as we've seen in this outbreak,” Ms. Marshall said. “So it's important to remind people that if they are ill, they should not visit people in acute or residential care sites.”</p>
<p>As a result of the outbreak, VIHA has imposed visiting restrictions and taken other steps to try to limit the spread of the illness, such as closing a common dining area and serving residents meals in their rooms. Most people in the facility are in shared, four-person rooms. Added cleaning measures are in place and the facility is not admitting any new residents.</p>
<p>The residents who have died in the outbreak all had “multiple medical challenges,” VIHA says, and several had been receiving palliative care. Medical reviews are under way to determine how or whether the respiratory condition may have contributed to the deaths.</p>
<p>Laboratory tests at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control have not yet confirmed the organism involved in the respiratory condition, but influenza A and B and H1N1 have been ruled out.</p>

</p>
<p>One more frail, elderly person has died of the mysterious respiratory illness laying siege to Victoria's Glengarry Hospital.</p>
<p>Vancouver Island Health Authority reported one person died Saturday as a result of the illness. The victim was one of three new cases revealed late last week on the Fairfield unit of the hospital.</p>
<p>Late last week, three staff members also came down with the illness.</p>
<p>Until then, the illness appeared to be restricted to the 70-bed Chandler unit of the 140-bed hospital. The Glengarry, on Fairfield Road, provides extended care to mostly elderly patients.</p>
<p>Initially, it appeared that 20 patients in the Chandler unit had fallen ill and nine had died. The people infected ranged in age from 81 to 97. Five of the dead were palliative-care patients.</p>
<p>Investigations and lab tests are continuing in an effort to identify the illness, which in its initial stages resembles a common cold with such symptoms as runny noses, coughing, chest congestion, feeling unwell and fever.</p>
<p>Tests have ruled out the A, B and H1N1 influenza strains as well as legionnaire's disease.</p>
<p>Until the outbreak is declared over, health officials are warning friends and family to stay away for now. If they must visit, they should be prepared to take extra precautions, like wearing a mask, a hospital gown and washing hands on entering and leaving the facility.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Four years in the making: Larry O'Brien, politician; The mayor has a new understanding of how things work, and a more conciliatory attitude,</b>
</div><div>Joanne Chianello   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1572 words</div><div>2 May 2010</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Mayor Larry O'Brien began last Wednesday's council meeting by effusively thanking the "hard-working public servants" who dealt with the H1N1 crisis last year.</p>
<p>O'Brien then went on to congratulate Councillor Clive Doucet for being recently named Man of the Year by the local Consumers Association. The mayor thanked Doucet -- a councillor who does not pass up an opportunity to savage the mayor's high-priority Lansdowne redevelopment project -- for his work in the area of city sustainability.</p>
<p>Later in the meeting, when wrapping up debate on the Ottawa Farmers' Market, O'Brien pronounced of a colleague he seldom sees eye-to-eye with: "I have been impressed by the logic of Councillor (Diane) Holmes." He then voted with her on the issue.</p>
<p>In the past few months, the mayor has become a fountain of gratitude, one minute lauding a diligent staff member for hard work on a report, the next patting a councillor on the back for leadership on an obscure file.</p>
<p>Is he ramping up for a re-election campaign? Although this week's graciousness might suggest he's got an eye on the October ballot box, some of his closest associates believe he is still undecided. O'Brien himself says he'll announce his decision in June.</p>
<p>But one thing that is not in question is that in less than a year, since his acquittal in a bribery trial last summer, O'Brien has unexpectedly changed into what he clearly was not four years ago: a politician.</p>
<p>His swaggering my-way-or-the-highway attitude in 2006 has given way to a better understanding of how complicated the city is to run and a greater, if not respect, perhaps patience for the public process.</p>
<p>Of all the roles the mayor has to assume -- ribbon-cutting figurehead, chief executive of a $2-billion public entity, social outreach officer -- O'Brien has found being a political administrator the most challenging.</p>
<p>"It's been me against the bureaucracy and I think we've both learned a lot," said O'Brien in a recent interview. "I have a huge respect for people in the public service. These people have a devilishly difficult job."</p>
<p>The fact that he's likely cresting the steep learning curve of city municipal politics is one reason he might consider running again. He would also not have to contend with the black cloud of the criminal trial that cast a shadow over two years of his term as mayor.</p>
<p>"You can't go through that without being changed and frankly, a little bit fearful," he said. "And I think that perhaps that's good. It makes me think twice or even a third time before I do something. I might even sleep on it."</p>
<p>Between the personal anguish of the trial and the public challenge of learning that government is not a business, the past few years have "taken a significant portion of my ego and put it where it is more appropriate," laughed O'Brien, deploying what admirers would describe as his unique brand of charm.</p>
<p>"This new Larry has a little smaller ego and I'm happy with that, too. Even my wife says I'm a better man."</p>
<p>But he'll be taking more than his new philosophical outlook into consideration when he decides whether to run again.</p>
<p>Most important, there are the number of checkmarks he's ticked on the city's to-do list: the multi-million-dollar Ottawa River clean-up and sewer-system overhaul, the green-bin program, the new downtown convention centre, the cancellation of what had become an unpopular light-rail project and the agreement of council on a new plan. It was O'Brien who brought in consultant Bob Plamondon to oversee a new budget process that was widely viewed as a great improvement over the previous system.</p>
<p>That many of these programs were in the works before O'Brien ever took office is almost beside the point. The mayor doesn't deny it -- indeed, he gives "full credit to former mayor (Bob) Chiarelli" for the convention centre, as he does to Councillor Peter Hume for the green bins.</p>
<p>But surely O'Brien will be weighing those successes against the electorate's memory of other not-so-positive details of his term of</p>
<p>office: that the cancellation of the LRT cost taxpayers almost $37 million, that some residents hold him responsible for a seven-week public transit strike that paralysed the city, that he tried (unsuccessfully) to re-open the city boundary debate after discussion with developers and that a zero tax increase really doesn't mean zero after all.</p>
<p>And then there's Lansdowne.</p>
<p>A 2008 proposal by a group of area businessmen to redevelop the park halted an international design competition already in progress for the site. Chaos and controversy ensued. Critics say that the entire process -- or lack thereof -- surrounding the plans to redevelop the historic Ottawa site has divided the city.</p>
<p>But when asked if he would go back in time to change anything about the way he handled the issue, O'Brien responds with a resounding "No."</p>
<p>"We ended up in a better place. If we didn't take advantage of that opportunity -- along with advice from the NCC, the city and the public -- we wouldn't be in a position where council would be able to vote on it in June."</p>
<p>It's a reminder that there's still a spark of that pre-trial, uncensored Larry burning behind the mayor's more recent conciliatory demeanour. But if you really want to fan the flames of his civic passions, just mention economic development.</p>
<p>The mayor has brought in a consultant who is working with staff and some councillors on an economic development plan expected to be released in June, like the Lansdowne design plans. It's becoming rather obvious why O'Brien chose the month to announce his campaign intentions. And the issue is the clearest signal yet that he's still seriously considering running again.</p>
<p>"It's so important in the next part of the century to make economic development a priority, if not the priority," said O'Brien of Ottawa's economy. He believes that the municipal government has a role to play in attracting investment, in helping local entrepreneurs grow their businesses.</p>
<p>And the biggest problem, said the mayor, is that the current council is not up to the task.</p>
<p>"I don't think enough of the councillors have a view of this as being an issue. I think this should be a debate in the coming election."</p>
<p>Although O'Brien says the three pillars of a sustainable city are social, environmental and economic, he believes the city has given plenty of attention to the first two and not enough to the latter. It's why he went on a business mission to China last month and will pitch Ottawa as an investment destination to venture capitalists in New York later this month.</p>
<p>It's also why this week he voted against a modest $100,000 pilot project to bring city drinking water to public events free of charge and why he took a pass on attending an international cycling conference in Copenhagen in June.</p>
<p>O'Brien is happy to let others take the lead on files he's not interested in. And that's fine with most councillors, especially committee chairs, who gain the leeway to put their experience to good use. But there are those who believe a mayor needs to be more than a delegator.</p>
<p>Councillor Alex Cullen, who is a candidate for mayor, said council has been leaderless under O'Brien. On the last budget, for example, he said the mayor's office came up with a plan that would hold property-tax hikes under four per cent, but required cuts that were unpalatable to voters.</p>
<p>"As a mayor, he should have known that," said Cullen, adding that it was councillors who came up with doable savings. "This is a mayor who loves being mayor, but doesn't like to do the heavy lifting."</p>
<p>And yet O'Brien's willingness to share the burden has allowed Cullen, the chair of the transit committee, to take the lead on several issues, including the LRT.</p>
<p>Cullen doesn't deny it. "Yes, he's become a better mayor over the years," he admitted, adding that witnessing O'Brien's evolution close up has been like "giving someone a pair of skates and watch them learn to skate."</p>
<p>He described O'Brien as "a great guy to have a beer with" whose flaws are "little experience and a very short attention span."</p>
<p>Even if that assessment is true, it wouldn't necessarily hurt O'Brien at the ballot box: the odds often favour the affable candidate over the policy wonk. The question now is whether the mayor makes that bet.</p>

Larry O'Brien decides to run in the next municipal election, he'll
be going into it with more than a new philosophical direction. He's
got a checklist of things that got done during his tenure, including
the green-bin program and the new downtown convention centre.   </p>

<p>Brad Billingsley could have been waiting for his tee time at an Arizona golf course.</p>
<p>Instead, the former California resident and his wife Linda were in a lagoon off Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, snapping photos of grey whales bobbing next to their small charter boat.</p>
<p>"Every day, it's an adventure here," Brad Billingsley said. "It's added 20 years to my life."</p>
<p>Brad, 62, and Linda Billingsley, 61, are among the "silver surge" of baby boomers seeking alternative retirement nests in Mexico, according to a recent report by the International Community Foundation.</p>
<p>It's not certain how many U.S. retirees are living in Mexico -- a 2004 study puts the number between 500,000 and 600,000 -- but the foundation and other researchers say an increase is likely as more boomers settle into their golden years and find Mexico an affordable alternative.</p>
<p>Almost half the retirees living in coastal areas are getting by comfortably on less than $1,000 per month, said the report, which cites the growth of real estate projects targeted at retirees as proof that aging Americans are flocking across the border.</p>
<p>The Billingsleys had seriously considered a retirement community with a golf course in central Arizona. But they lacked the enthusiasm for fairway living that seemed to consume retirees there.</p>
<p>"Their entire lives were involved with golf," Brad said.</p>
<p>In 2007, the couple became expatriates and settled into a $300,000, two-bedroom beachfront condominium in Rosarito Beach, in Baja California.</p>
<p>They've made the most of their retirement dollars, Brad said. The cost of living -- from groceries to health care -- is low in their beachfront town and there's plenty to do, such as driving down the coast to Cabo, walking on the beach and shopping.</p>
<p>The couple lived in California's Bay Area for 60 years. Sometimes they miss their old haunts, especially bookstores, Brad said. But like most expatriates surveyed in the foundation's report, they return often to the U.S. The Billingsleys make a trip across the border to San Diego every few weeks.</p>
<p>Affordability, quality of life, weather and proximity to the U.S. were top reasons retirees chose Mexico, according to the foundation report, which surveyed 842 expats about their experiences.</p>
<p>"After the market crash of 2008, we wanted to better understand what was going on with retirees in Mexico," said Richard Kiy, president and chief executive of the foundation, a southern California-based non-profit that works to increase charitable giving and volunteerism across U.S. borders.</p>
<p>In an 88-question survey of retirees 50 and older, the foundation found that expatriates had weathered the economic storm well.</p>
<p>The foundation's 17-page report, released in March, deals with demographics and day-to-day basics such as public safety concerns and household expenses of retirees in Mexico's coastal areas such as Cancun, Rosarito Beach, Rocky Point and Puerto Vallarta.</p>
<p>Four followup studies over the next few months will tackle topics that include the impact on Mexico's environment, health-care accessibility, real estate and civic involvement by U.S. retirees.</p>
<p>A weakening American economy, U.S. State Department travel alerts and worries about the H1N1 virus have hurt tourist travel numbers to Mexico over the past year, but the country still remains an attractive haven for retirees, said Anne McEnany, co-author of the foundation's report and the foundation's senior adviser for environment and conservation.</p>
<p>Reports of narcotics-related violence, especially in border cities such as Tijuana and Nogales, initially gave many retirees the jitters, McEnany said. But that anxiety fades away after they've settled into their new homes, she said.</p>
<p>"I'm really saddened to see coverage of (Mexican) crime in the media," said Doug Gray, 60, a retired fire captain from California.</p>
<p>He and his wife Cyndi recently purchased a condominium in Manzanillo, a port city between Puerto Vallarta and Acapulco. They say they feel at least as safe walking around the markets and boulevards as they did in the U.S.</p>
<p>"We really love the pace," Cyndi said. "It's a slower pace and you can sit down there and get into the groove. I can unplug."</p>
<p>Ellen Fields, another expat from California, lives in Merida, on the Yucatan Peninsula.</p>
<p>Fields and her husband James run Yucatanliving.com,a website for expats. They moved to Merida from San Luis Obispo in 2002.</p>
<p>Ellen says she's enchanted by the Old World atmosphere of the markets and customs. "It's a very gracious culture." she said. "You walk down the street here and people say hello to you."</p>

<p>The Vancouver Island Health Authority is monitoring three sick staff members at Glengarry Hospital, where nine people have died from an unspecified respiratory illness.</p>
<p>VIHA spokeswoman Shannon Marshall said the three staff members reported sick yesterday, but it has not been determined if they are suffering from the illness that broke out in the Chandler Unit at Glengarry Hospital last week.</p>
<p>Maureen Donaldson, 50, a care attendant in the unit -- where the nine people died and 11 more were infected -- said she became ill a month ago with the same respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms that she saw afflict residents.</p>
<p>"We are front-line workers and we are in contact with every body fluid," said Donaldson, who is currently undergoing tests.</p>
<p>Marshall said no new cases have been reported among the residents. So far, the patients have tested negative for influenza A, B and H1N1. Yesterday, VIHA learned that tests for legionella -- associated with Legionnaires' disease -- were also negative.</p>
<p>Tests for environmental contaminants have also come back clean. The Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver plans to conduct more tests next week.</p>
<p>Marshall said evidence suggests transmission is person-to-person.</p>
<p>Norovirus has been active in the Chandler unit since April 6, but no new cases have been reported in the last several days and the facility is on a 96-hour countdown, after which it can declare that outbreak over.</p>
<p>Those stricken with the respiratory illness are improving.</p>
<p>A case review is still being conducted to confirm whether the nine deaths are all related to the respiratory illness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, casual staff are no longer allowed to work back-to-back shifts at different facilities to prevent transmission into another site.</p>
<p>Glengarry has 140 residents. The Chandler Unit had 70 residents before the outbreak. Infection prevention-control measures are in place.</p>
<p>Marshall emphasized that people who are sick should not visit residential-care facilities.</p>

<p>NORTH AMERICA</p>
<p>DEMOCRATS UNVEIL IMMIGRATION PLAN</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/PHOENIX -- U.S. Senate Democratic leaders unveiled Thursday a "framework" for overhauling the country's "broken" immigration system as protests mounted against Arizona's crackdown on illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>With an estimated 10.8 million people in the United States illegally, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and fellow Democrats said the first step toward reform must be bolstered U.S. border security.</p>
<p>They also called for creation of a high-tech identification card for immigrant workers.</p>
<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>TURKEY TO VOTE ON GOVERNMENT'S POWER</p>
<p>ISTANBUL -- Turkey is preparing to hold a referendum on key constitutional changes that will grant its Islamist prime minister unrivalled power in a country traditionally dominated by the military.</p>
<p>Parliament finished a debate on Thursday on the reforms that mark the culmination of a seven-year drive by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the prime minister, to make the elected government Turkey's most powerful institution.</p>
<p>Erdogan used his AK Party's majority to pass 27 amendments over the opposition of the minority parties. Antagonism between the factions escalated during the debate and three politicians, including the trade minister and a Kurdish leader, were injured in scuffles.</p>
<p>Analysts said that the era of untrammelled military power and extensive interference in the political system by the judiciary would be consigned to the past by the vote.</p>
<p>ASHTON EXPECTED TO QUIT EU POST</p>
<p>BRUSSELS -- Baroness Ashton is expected to stand down as European Union foreign minister within months after widespread criticism that she has failed in the post she was expected to fill for five years.</p>
<p>Less than six months into the job as EU High Representative for foreign affairs, it has been reported that colleagues believe Lady Ashton, the best paid female politician in the world, is "on the verge of resignation."</p>
<p>Senior officials predict that the 54-year-old Labour peer could step down later this year after being politically damaged by accusations that she is too inexperienced and weak to fill the post created by the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
<p>"Every day is an uphill struggle," said a European Commission official. "No one predicts she can stay five years, not even she."</p>
<p>Lady Ashton has come under fire from powerful countries, led by France, for allowing the commission to seize too much control of a European diplomatic service she is building from scratch.</p>
<p>Her lack of political authority has been blamed for a failure to stamp out bureaucratic in-fighting in Brussels over who will control the new European External Action Service of 7,000 diplomats in more than 130 embassies around the world.</p>
<p>BROWN PUT TO TEST IN FINAL TV DEBATE</p>
<p>LONDON -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown battled to keep his fading hopes of re-election alive Thursday in a crunch TV debate, amid a storm of criticism for slamming a widowed voter as "bigoted."</p>
<p>The last of three televised contests with Conservative leader David Cameron and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg focused on the economy, an issue on which former finance minister Brown could be expected to do well.</p>
<p>But the widespread condemnation of his remarks Wednesday about 66-year-old Gillian Duffy has piled the pressure on the prime minister and his Labour Party, already trailing in second and even third place in the polls.</p>
<p>Brown apologized in person after being overheard dismissing the grandmother as a "bigoted woman" following an apparently routine campaign encounter in which she quizzed him, notably about the sensitive issue of immigration.</p>
<p>He made another apology on the Labour website Thursday, saying he was "truly sorry and mortified that I have hurt somebody," and told reporters that "bigoted" was "the wrong word to use."</p>
<p>VICTIMS MONUMENT UNVEILED BY QUEEN</p>
<p>THE HAGUE -- Dutch Queen Beatrix unveiled a monument Thursday for seven people killed when a man rammed his car into festival-goers in a failed attack on the royal family a year ago.</p>
<p>In a solemn ceremony in the central city of Apeldoorn, the scene of last year's assault, the monarch drew aside a white sheet to reveal a glass and granite monument resembling a cardboard box containing blue and white balloons.</p>
<p>"Here is a monument that carries the names of the fallen," Apeldoorn Mayor Fred de Graaf told mourners at the event, which was closed to the public and media but broadcast live on public television.</p>
<p>TEACHER CLEARED OF ATTEMPTED MURDER</p>
<p>LONDON -- A teacher who bludgeoned an abusive pupil over the head with a metal weight during a lesson, shouting "die, die, die," was cleared of attempted murder on Thursday.</p>
<p>Peter Harvey, 50, fractured the 14-year-old boy's skull after the child swore at him during a science lesson last July.</p>
<p>Some of the class wanted to taunt the teacher, who had just returned from sick leave for depression and stress, to provoke an angry reaction which they planned to film secretly.</p>
<p>The jury took less than two hours to clear the father-of-two of attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm with intent, the Press Association reported. Harvey, who admitted another charge of grievous bodily harm, has spent eight months in prison on remand awaiting trial.</p>
<p>He told police that he thought he had killed the boy. "I can't remember it too well but I do recall it was like watching it on television, like it was not actually happening to me," Harvey said, according to transcripts of police interviews read out at Nottingham Crown Court. "I remember standing over him with this metal weight and I remember hitting him twice.... I thought I had killed him."</p>
<p>Harvey attacked the boy with a three-kilogram weight during a lesson at All Saints' Roman Catholic school in Mansfield. Jurors heard during the four-day trial that pupils at the school were trying to irritate Harvey so his reaction could be caught on a camcorder secretly operated by a girl pupil.</p>
<p>The children intended to pass the footage around the school to humiliate their teacher, the court heard.</p>
<p>PROSECUTORS PROBE PRESIDENTIAL CRASH</p>
<p>WARSAW -- Poland's prosecutor general said Thursday investigators were probing four possible causes of the April 10 air disaster that killed 96 people including Polish president Lech Kaczynski.</p>
<p>Investigators were looking into "equipment failure," "crew behaviour," "poor organization or flight preparation" and the "action of third parties" as possible reasons for the disaster, according to a statement by the prosecutor general.</p>
<p>The "action of third parties" is defined as "a terrorist act, suggestions or pressures against the crew," but the statement said that so far there was no evidence of this kind, although the possibility could not yet be definitively ruled out.</p>
<p>AFRICA</p>
<p>ETHIOPIA REBURIES MENGISTU VICTIMS</p>
<p>ADDIS ABABA -- Dozens of Ethiopians marched Thursday to rebury family members massacred during dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam's "Red Terror" purge which claimed tens of thousands of lives some 30 years ago.</p>
<p>A funeral convoy of dark vehicles made its way through the capital's main streets carrying coffins draped in the Ethiopian flag, as a military band played sombre tunes.</p>
<p>Relatives observed a minute's silence at a museum where they were to be re-buried.</p>
<p>The museum opened last month after three years of construction. It is to honour victims of the 1977-78 campaign of state terror carried out on Mengistu's orders to wipe out his opponents.</p>
<p>Only 10 bodies have been identified since they were exhumed in 1994 by Argentinian forensic experts from a former security compound in the north of Addis Ababa.</p>
<p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
<p>SIERRA LEONE AXES 1,000 FAKE TEACHERS</p>
<p>FREETOWN -- Sierra Leone has deleted the names of over 1,000 "ghost" teachers from the payroll after discovering that they were made up by principals as part of a scam, the education minister said Thursday.</p>
<p>The discovery came after the government "named and shamed" principals allegedly caught up in the scam as part of a "verification exercise," minister Minkailu Bah told reporters.</p>
<p>"The principals started writing to say that payments were being made to 'ghost teachers' and wanted the names to be removed from the pay vouchers," Bah added.</p>
<p>He said there was even a "ghost school," the address of which turned out to be that of police headquarters.</p>
<p>U.S. TROOPS RAIDED HOME, MP SAYS</p>
<p>NAZARABAD, Afghanistan -- U.S. troops raided the home of a female member of the Afghan parliament and killed a neighbour who was one of her relatives, the MP said on Thursday, an incident that sparked angry protests in the east.</p>
<p>A spokesman for foreign forces in Afghanistan said Western and Afghan troops had raided a house in the area and shot dead an armed man but was not able to comment on whether the house belonged to a member of parliament.</p>
<p>Nighttime raids by Western troops and civilian casualties are among the most incendiary issues in Afghanistan, and the targeting of a female parliamentarian would raise the political temperature at a time when NATO is preparing a large offensive.</p>
<p>Safia Sediqi, an outspoken member of parliament from eastern Nangarhar province, said scores of U.S. soldiers raided her village home shortly before midnight.</p>
<p>Inside the house, they broke furniture and tied up family members, including her brother, for hours, she said. Outside, they shot dead a neighbour, who was also a relative by marriage.</p>
<p>BOMB KILLS EIGHT IN BAGHDAD: MINISTRY</p>
<p>BAGHDAD -- Eight people were killed and 20 wounded on Thursday when a car bomb exploded near an alcohol store in Baghdad, said an interior ministry official.</p>
<p>The explosion occurred around 8 p.m. in Shurta Raba, a southern district of the capital. The area was busy as people gathered at the end of the working week before Friday and Saturday, the weekend in most Arab countries.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Michael Ignatieff 's real problem</b>
</div><div>Jonathan Kay   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>665 words</div><div>30 April 2010</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Canadian federal politics have turned into Groundhog Day-- with Michael Ignatieff playing the role of Bill Murray. Prorogation, Afghan detainees, abortion funding, the Suaad Hagi Mohamud affair, H1N1 and native body bags, Jaffer-Guergis: Every month or two, there is some new overhyped Tory quasi-scandal that, my Liberal friends assure me, will destroy Stephen Harper's support and catapult their party into government. But the poll numbers refuse to obey: This week, yet another poll was released showing the Tories with about a 5% lead over the Liberals.</p>
<p>Why is Michael Ignatieff -- who's now been Liberal Party leader for a year and a half -- failing to make any headway? A newly released survey from <span class="companylink">Reader's Digest Canada</span> suggests a single-word answer: trust.</p>
<p>Every year, <span class="companylink">Reader's Digest</span> presents Canadian survey respondents with a list of 50 prominent Canadians, and asks them to pick the one they trust most. This year's results are described in the current issue (full disclosure: I contributed to RD's report), and present the Liberals with grim news.</p>
<p>Politicians of all stripes generally fare poorly in the RD survey: The best performers tended to be middle-aged do-gooders, athletes, television personalities and apolitical public servants. In this year's survey, the top seven spots were David Suzuki (193 votes), Mike Holmes (112), Michael J. Fox (96), Queen Elizabeth II (89), Lloyd Robertson (64), Sheila Fraser (64) and Stephen Lewis (50). Not until we get to the eighth spot do we hit Stephen Harper at 48 votes -- just 4% of all votes cast.</p>
<p>Yet Harper's performance was stellar compared to his political counterparts. Elizabeth May and Jack Layton tied for second among party leaders with 11 votes each (putting them tied for 28th place overall). Michael Ignatieff? He barely registered with just three votes -- out of a total of 1,205 people questioned. All three votes came from male respondents, which means that precisely zero of the 637 female respondents ranked Ignatieff as their most trusted Canadian (Harper got 26 male votes and 22 female).</p>
<p>To put Ignatieff's tally of three votes in context, it puts him in a tie, for 40th place, with Sex and the City star Kim Cattrall, Superbad actor Seth Rogen and some guy by the name of Daniel Negreanu, who -- according to Wikipedia--makes his living as a professional gambler under the nickname "Kid Poker."</p>
<p>In fact, Ignatieff didn't even get the most votes within his own party. "Kid Liberal" Justin Trudeau got 12 votes, as many as Rex Murphy and Kevin Newman -- and four times as many as Ignatieff.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this survey was taken last fall, at a time when Ignatieff had suffered a downward blip in the polls. Even so, Liberal supporters should find it alarming that their man ranks so low on such a fundamental index as trust.</p>
<p>As noted above, many Liberals I speak to still express optimism that Ignatieff can turn the corner -- all it will take, apparently, is a few more Tory mini-scandals, and for Canadians to "get to know him better." But it's now been a year and a half since the man became opposition leader. And it's not clear what more we're going to learn. This is an intellectual, after all, whose favourite literary subject is himself, his bloodline and his lofty visions for Canada--and indeed, for all of civilized humanity.</p>
<p>That Ignatieff ranks so low on trust suggests that it is something quite basic at play -- perhaps the old knock regarding the many years he's spent away from this country; or the entirely contradictory things he's said about torture, Iraq and Israel. Either way, the trust issue goes a long way to explain how this minority government has lasted so long, with no end in sight.</p>

<p>As Shoppers Drug Mart Corp. falls to its lowest level in more than five years, convincing arguments to buy the stock at these low levels are few and far between. On Thursday, two analyst reports were hardly uplifting.</p>
<p>The first, from Kenric Tyghe at Raymond James, cut the target price to $42 from $45, while maintaining a “market perform” recommendation.</p>
<p>“We remain cautious on Shoppers Drug Mart’s growth outlook despite incremental data points, given the noise ahead of the reform proposals coming into effect May 15, 2010 and the current lack of visibility on the magnitude and specifics of the cost cutting initiatives,” the analyst said in a note.</p>
<p>The reference here, of course, is to the proposed regulatory changes from the Ontario government, which will reduce earnings derived from generic drugs at Shoppers and its competitors.</p>
<p>The government’s announcement in early April whacked Shoppers Drug Mart shares, sending them on a 19 per cent slide. Its disappointing first quarter results, released on Wednesday, only added to the misery.</p>
<p>Michael Van Aelst, an analyst at TD Newcrest, cut his target price on the stock to $39 from $40 and maintained a “hold” recommendation.</p>
<p>“In our opinion first quarter results were a bit on the soft side as the weaker cough, cold and flu season meant that customers had less reason to stop into a drugstore to purchase their habitual cold remedies,” the analyst said. “In addition, the H1N1 scare appeared to cause people to stock up the medicine cabinet more than usual in earlier quarters.”</p>
<p>His new target is based on slightly lower earnings estimates for 2011 – but those estimates might have to be adjusted again if other provinces follow Ontario and make regulatory changes of their own, a possibility that is clearly baking a lot of uncertainty into the share price.</p>

<p>Re: "B.C. must stop drug kickbacks," editorial, April 25.</p>
<p>Community pharmacy in B.C. is one part of the health-care system that works extremely well. Patients get timely, accessible and expert medication advice from health-care professionals based in their communities.</p>
<p>Pharmacists are among the most trusted health care professionals, universally recognized as the medication experts. But pharmacists can now do much more than dispense medications.</p>
<p>In the past 18 months pharmacists have expanded their practices to be able to adapt certain prescriptions and administer injections. During the winter of 2009/2010 pharmacists provided more than 25,000 H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccinations.</p>
<p>As B.C.'s population ages, reliance on pharmacy services will only increase. That is why it is so important that we find a sustainable funding model that ensures the viability of community pharmacy so that it can continue to serve the health needs of British Columbians.</p>
<p>Detailed negotiations about the complex funding model for pharmacies are taking place. We are working for a negotiated solution between the pharmacy profession and the provincial government that provides fair and reasonable remuneration for pharmacy services.</p>
<p>This is the best way to ensure that the vital community health services provided by pharmacists can be maintained in the future.</p>

<p>Victoria</p>
<p>Illness claims nine lives</p>
<p>at long-term care facility</p>
<p>Nine residents have died since April 5 at a Victoria hospital where an influenza-like illness has been detected, says the Vancouver Island Health Authority. Spokesperson Suzanne Germain said Tuesday that 19 people have become ill since the respiratory outbreak began at Glengarry Hospital, which is home to frail and elderly patients. Lab tests have confirmed that the illness is not H1N1 or influenza A and B. More tests are being done, she said.</p>

<p>Witness says he saw officer beside insurgent's body</p>
<p>The key prosecution witness at an unprecedented court martial says he saw a Canadian Forces captain standing over a captured Afghan insurgent with his rifle pointed at his chest seconds after two quick shots were fired. Capt. Robert Semrau, 36, is charged with second degree murder for the alleged battlefield execution - or mercy killing - of a severely wounded and disarmed Taliban in October 2008. Cpl. Steven Fournier demonstrated Semrau's stance with his C8 assault rifle barrel "at a perfect 45-degree angle" toward the insurgent. "The muzzle was within a metre of the man on the ground."</p>

<p>in Syncrude case</p>
<p>Win or lose, executives of oilsands giant Syncrude will not face jail time for the deaths of 1,600 ducks on one of its oilsands tailings ponds. Federal prosecutor Kent Brown said Tuesday that while one environmental charge against the company includes a maximum penalty of six months in jail for executives, he won't ask for that even if he wins the case. Syncrude is defending itself against two charges that it failed to keep ducks off a chemical pond near Fort McMurray, Alta., two years ago.</p>

<p>Robbery rates highest in B.C., prairie provinces in 2008</p>
<p>The western provinces led the country in 2008 for robberies and crimes involving knives, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday. It's the latest study showing higher rates for a variety of crimes occur west of the Ontario-Manitoba boundary. "The highest rates of police-reported robbery are in Western Canada, particularly Manitoba, similar to the trend for violent crime in general," the report says. Manitoba saw 158 robberies per 100,000 people in 2008 - well ahead of Saskatchewan at 128, B.C. at 123 and Alberta at 105. All other provinces were below 100.</p>

<p>Eight people have been taken to hospital after a tanker truck exploded while refuelling at a PetroCanada refinery in Montreal. The power of the blast launched the truck's driver into the air.

</p>
<p>The deaths of nine people at a long-term care facility in Victoria have been linked to an outbreak of respiratory disease.</p>
<p>Several residents in one of the units of the Glengarry Hospital care home first developed respiratory symptoms at the end of March, Vancouver Island Health Authority officials said Tuesday. Health workers initially thought the patients were suffering from Norovirus, a common gastrointestinal illness, the officials said.</p>
<p>The respiratory outbreak was declared on April 22. Health officials said 19 people became ill from the respiratory bug. All of the residents were elderly, and five of them were already receiving palliative care.</p>
<p>Vancouver Island health workers are conducting a medical review to see what role the respiratory condition played in the deaths.</p>
<p>"We take outbreaks in residential-care facilities very seriously because the frail, elderly population is more susceptible to serious complications and even death from illnesses," Dr. David Forrest, associate medical director of infection prevention, said in a news release. "The fact that no staff have been affected by this illness would suggest it is a mild illness in most people that is affecting our frail elderly residents more."</p>
<p>The disease has yet to be identified, but influenza A and B and H1N1 have been ruled out. Results from the BC Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver are expected this week.</p>

<p>Vancouver - -- A respiratory illness has killed nine residents of a Victoria seniors hospital, forcing the facility to restrict visitors and confine residents to their rooms. Shannon Marshall, a spokeswoman for the Vancouver Island Health Authority, said 19 people at the Glengarry Hospital have been stricken with the illness since April 5.</p>
<p>Lab tests have so far ruled out H1N1, but further tests are needed to pinpoint this particular virus, Ms. Marshall said. “This is a respiratory illness and we don't know yet what it is.”</p>

<p>Her birth certificate reads Eilleen Regina Edwards, but you know her as Shania Twain. Twain is not just a terrific stage name for a country-pop singer, it has become the signature handle of a music artist who, one could argue, has crafted a whole new sound and single-handedly created an entirely different genre: pop meets country.</p>
<p>Tonight, Twain will mentor the remaining contestants on an American Idol (CTV, Fox, 8 p.m.) season that suddenly looks more compelling, thanks to the emergence of raspy-voiced David Cook-soundalike Lee DeWyze as a contender and those incredible grace notes hit last week by Crystal Bowersox during her emotional rendition of the Curtis Mayfield anthem People Get Ready.</p>
<p>Ironically, Twain was the guest judge in Chicago when Bowersox - considerably glammed-down then from now - auditioned. Bowersox started writing songs as a 10-year-old in small-town Ohio, a shy kid with Type 1 diabetes who was relentlessly picked on for being poor and for wearing unstylish hand-me-downs. Her dad didn't have money, but he doted on his daughter's talent and did his best to shield her from life's hard knocks.</p>
<p>It's a story that will strike a deep chord in Twain, whose own childhood was hardly idyllic. Twain will have canny advice for Siobhan Magnus, the 20-year-old from Cape Cod, Mass., who has mad ability but has lost her confidence. And Twain will probably have sage counsel for country-style rockers DeWyze and Casey Jones. It's Bowersox, though, who is likely to bring out Twain's true inner being. For a season that was supposed to be colourless, American Idol got interesting all of a sudden. Come on over and enjoy the show.</p>

You thinking dieting is hard? She has hepatitis! That's hard.</p>
<p>- PBS Frontline (PBS, 10 p.m.) asks if the cure is worse than the disease in the timely program The Vaccine War. Partly the result of continuing fallout from last summer's swine-flu scare and partly the result of questions people are asking themselves more often these days, The Vaccine War draws a line between public health officials and vaccine advocates on the one hand, and a growing chorus of doubters on the other. The Vaccine War may make you think twice about getting that "triple shot" next time.</p>

<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>397 words</div><div>27 April 2010</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Ken Taylor, the man who acted as a U.S. spy and hid six Americans in Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis says the stage is set for Canada to step in once again and make itself known as a world leader.</p>
<p>This opportunity will come in June when Canada hosts international heads of states at the G8/G20 summits in Huntsville, Ont., and in Toronto. It'll be the first time Canada has held the meetings since 2002.</p>
<p>"It's time for Canada to show ourselves to the rest of the world and what we can do," Taylor, Canada's ambassador in Iran from 1977 to 1980, said in an interview Monday.</p>
<p>Already, Canada is looked upon as a pioneer on some fronts, including health care and pandemic management following the recent listeria and H1N1 flu outbreaks. And now is the ideal time to cement the country's credibility in those fields, particularly after the international exposure from the Vancouver Olympics, says Taylor.</p>
<p>Canada has set itself apart by its quick response in providing relief after the earthquake in Haiti and its role in the war in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>He said Canada is also seen as more politically stable than other countries, including the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>In January, it was revealed that Taylor, who was awarded the Order of Canada for sneaking U.S. Embassy staff into his Tehran home by passing them off as a Canadian film crew, also became the "de facto" CIA chief when the American Embassy in Iran was seized by dissident students on Nov. 4, 1979.</p>
<p>He eventually helped the six leave Iran by arranging Canadian passports for them. The remaining American hostages were released in January 1981.</p>
<p>According to Taylor, this was an example of Canada being unafraid to lead during a crisis.</p>
<p>The controversial decision to help the U.S. was one that was made at the time by then-prime minister Joe Clark.</p>
<p>"Leaders are more cautious these days. I think for the first 100 days, they have some bold ideas but then the reality of politics overcome them," he said.</p>

<p>With the revelation concerning the millions of dollars worth of H1N1 vaccine that will have to be destroyed due to unforeseen expiry dates, some are chastising the provincial government for the lack of insight in the purchase of the medication.</p>
<p>I guess the government's crystal ball did not foresee that less than 50 per cent of the population would take advantage of the free vaccinations.</p>
<p>I would venture a guess that these same individuals would complain if the province had only purchased a limited quantity to reduce the chance of the drug expiring prior to being used.</p>
<p>It begs the old adage "damned if you do, and damned if you don't."</p>

<p>Re: "The fight of their lives; Amid last year's devastating H1N1 outbreak, a Strathmore woman and her baby, born days after her mom emerged from a coma, defied the odds to survive; Effects linger a year after outbreak," April 18.</p>
<p>Thank you to Richard Cuthbertson for telling the remarkable story of the young mom and her daughter, who survived a devastating bout of H1N1 flu. I truly believe that had it not been for the hard work, skills, and dedication of Alberta's healthcare professionals, the story might have had an entirely different ending.</p>
<p>While waiting in a hospital emergency room for countless hours, one is tempted to severely criticize our health-care system. Stories like Richard's show that our health-care workers are able to carry out their mission of providing Albertans with the best care possible, in spite of the hardships they are presented with hourly!</p>
<p>I hope Alberta's super health board reads the story and realizes that doctors, nurses, technicians, and other healthcare providers are working hard to provide us with a darn good healthcare system.</p>

</p>
<p>The Notre Dame Hounds overcame various forms of adversity en route to celebrating a second consecutive Telus Cup championship on Sunday.</p>
<p>"It certainly puts our school's motto -- Struggle and Emerge -- front and centre,'' head coach Del Pedrick said from Levis, Que., after the Hounds edged the Mississauga Reps 3-2 in the Canadian midget AAA boys hockey final.</p>
<p>The Hounds capped their season in triumphant fashion despite an inauspicious start. Notre Dame lost its first three games of the Saskatchewan Midget AAA Hockey League season. Shortly thereafter, four players were sidelined for between three weeks and two months when the H1N1 virus hit Athol Murray College of Notre Dame in Wilcox.</p>
<p>"We have a great bunch of guys,'' said Pedrick, who is also the school's director of hockey development. "It's 20 guys who worked together and had a common goal and fought through a lot of adversity this year.''</p>
<p>Initially, there were questions as to whether Notre Dame could repeat.</p>
<p>"I didn't think this was going to happen at the start of the year, but I feel great that it did,'' said Assiniboia-born defenceman Blaine Thomson, one of only two returnees from last season's edition -- captain Scott Bolland being the other.</p>
<p>"It was a completely different team overall from last year. We had a pretty rough start. Everybody wanted to carry the puck. We started to come together pretty quick in the season, probably in the first 10 games.''</p>
<p>Notre Dame, which was third in the regular-season standings, won the national midget AAA title for a record-tying fourth straight time. The Regina Pat Canadians have also won four titles.</p>
<p>Second in Esso Cup</p>
<p>Notre Dame's elite midget programs were showcased on the weekend. On Saturday, the midget AAA female Hounds finished second nationally at the Esso Cup in Regina.</p>
<p>The Hounds advanced to the Telus Cup championship game by defeating the St. John's Fog Devils 5-3 in Saturday's semifinal. Bolland (from Osoyoos, B.C.), Shea Howorko (Regina), Catlin Foley (Coronach), Daniel Dale (Grande Prairie, Alta.) and Morgan Rielly (Vancouver) scored for Notre Dame. Dale scored the winning goal at 12:44 of the third period, snapping a 3-3 tie.</p>
<p>Liam O'Brien scored the winner in the final, breaking a 2-2 tie at 7:56 of the third period. Tournament MVP Slater Koekkoek (Mountain, Ont.) and Marcus Messier (Canmore, Alta.) also scored for Notre Dame. Eric Locke had both goals for Mississauga, including a tally at 4:59 of the third period that created the 2-2 tie. O'Brien took it from there.</p>
<p>The Hounds peppered St. John's goalie Malcolm Subban with 55 shots. The Hounds' Riley Parker (from Abbotsford, B.C.) faced 25 shots.</p>
<p>The victory was especially sweet for Foley, who was with the midget AAA Hounds two seasons ago before spending the 2008-09 campaign with the Notre Dame Argos -- missing out on a national title in the process. He was part of the long-awaited celebration on Sunday.</p>
<p>"I don't think it has really sunk in yet that we're the national champions,'' Foley said. "It is a dream come true.''</p>

<p>I WANT YOUR LOVE – AND YOUR 187-MILLION VIEWS</p>
<p>For a long time, two young British brothers had the most-viewed video on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>. The spot was called “Charlie bit my finger – Again!” One of the brothers in the video was named Charlie, and the plot is, well, self-explanatory. However both brothers were recently bitten by fashion-slash-pop sensation Lady Gaga, whose video for the song Bad Romance is now <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> king, proving that the only thing the Internet loves more than a video of quarrelling British toddlers is a video of something … completely different.</p>
<p>THE LAW COMES CALLING</p>
<p>Earlier this year, an Italian court convicted <span class="companylink">Google</span> executives of violating a child's privacy after somebody uploaded to <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> a video of an autistic child being bullied. The decision had far-reaching implications; in order to make sure no illegal or offensive videos end up on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, the website would have to vet each individual clip – an almost impossible task with hundreds of millions of videos on the site. The court's decision was perhaps <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>'s most serious brush with the law, but there's no shortage of groups its model has angered – chiefly, record and movie companies. Every day, the site receives a flood of demands for the removal of videos, usually over copyright violations.</p>
<p>YOUTUBE, WE EARN</p>
<p>In recent years, <span class="companylink">Google</span> has been going all-out to translate its massive <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> viewership into something a little more profitable. Ads are popping up on millions of videos, and some companies have signed deals with <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> to create their own custom pages. For <span class="companylink">Google</span>, turning <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> into the web's next ad hub is a no-brainer: companies pay a lot more for an interactive display ad, such as a video clip, than they pay for static text ads that run on <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s traditional search engine.</p>
<p>“STVHRPR59 HAS UPLOADED A VIDEO!”</p>
<p>Recognizing <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>'s potential, government officials from around the planet have established a presence on the site. The Obama administration maintains a significant Youtube presence, with its own channel on the site. During the H1N1 scare, the Mexican secretary of health set up a channel. The Iraqi government has uploaded a small number of speeches and public service announcements. Even Prime Minister Stephen Harper gave the service a go, when he answered Canadians' questions on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> earlier this year.</p>
<p>REMEMBER THE CHOCOLATE RAIN GUY?</p>
<p>More than just about any service, <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> has managed to blur the lines between celebrity and laughing stock. Millions upon millions of people have now seen, commented on and made parodies of a video of a Canadian high-school kid wildly swinging a pretend light-saber. The video was discovered and uploaded to the web, where it became a viral hit, much to the embarrassment of the student who starred in it. Many an otherwise-unknown have found themselves caught in <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>'s bizarre hybrid of fame and ignobility: from an obese gentlemen singing an unbearably catchy pop tune, to a guy named Tay Zonday singing Chocolate Rain, to a kid who thought it'd be a good idea to plead with the world to leave Britney Spears alone.</p>
<p>BIRTH OF THE MEME</p>
<p>Every now and then, you'll get an e-mail from a friend with a title like: “Hey, check out this video of Barak Obama punching a crocodile in the mouth!” You'll click on the link, but what you'll see instead is ex-pop-star Rick Astley singing Never Gonna Give You Up. This is known as Rickrolling, and is one of the many strange mass-cultural phenomena facilitated by <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>. Others include videos of Adolf Hitler from the German movie Downfall, in which the fake English subtitles make the dictator sound enraged over trivial nonsense. Not to mention countless clips of a cat providing piano accompaniment to random people making fools of themselves – the great sociological commentary of the <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> age.</p>

<p>The optics could hardly be worse.</p>
<p>The Edmonton Oilers finish a distant dead last and respond by firing the long-serving, chronically sleep-deprived, selfless, professional men who supply the underachieving millionaire athletes with skate laces, tape, well-maintained equipment, fresh laundry and medical care.</p>
<p>In a blue-collar town, the sense of outrage at the perceived injustice of the firing of medical trainer Ken Lowe, equipment manager Barrie Stafford and his assistant Lyle (Sparky) Kulchisky, was palpable on Friday.</p>
<p>All anyone had to do to get a feel for the contempt out there was scan the hundreds of bitter comments on The Journal website or take a twirl through the Twitterverse.</p>
<p>"You ever notice how all our good players want to leave? That's probably Sparky's fault," wrote someone calling himself Lord Bob in a collection of retorts filed in the #OilersLogic category.</p>
<p>"No, reinforcements and winter coats won't be necessary," a wit at BlackAcesBlog chirped. "Stalingrad will be ours!"</p>
<p>More cutting still was this contribution: "We're famous in Edmonton so we shouldn't have to pay for shots of liquor. Just the bottles. Or actually, none of it."</p>
<p>In firing three consummately professional, unswervingly loyal foot soldiers -- a perfectly defensible decision, in and of itself -- Oilers general manager Steve Tambellini unwittingly offended people's sense of fairness and decency.</p>
<p>Something else. The dismissals tapped into a deep reservoir of pent-up anger directed at team president Kevin Lowe, the former GM and the man many see as the architect of the current state of this failed franchise. Many believe that, to say the least, he has not been sufficiently held to account for that failure.</p>
<p>Emotional? Well, yes, understandably so, considering Ken Lowe, Kevin's brother, had worked for the Oilers for 21 years, Stafford had been there 29 years, and Kulchisky had been Joey Moss's inseparable sidekick and much else.</p>
<p>When Tambellini fired vice-president of hockey operations and assistant GM Kevin Prendergast on Wednesday, many in the public opined the club had sacked the wrong Kevin.</p>
<p>When Ken Lowe was dismissed on Friday, the same people vented that the wrong Lowe had been sent packing.</p>
<p>To a large extent, the emotional reaction was another manifestation of the frustrated fan base finding its range. Last season, the target had been head coach Craig MacTavish. Sack him and watch the team improve, or so went the fans' logic.</p>
<p>Oops! Wrong target, as this year's 30th-place finish graphically demonstrated.</p>
<p>That the firings of Prendergast, Ken Lowe, Stafford and Kulchisky are part of a larger organizational shakeup, one that Tambellini articulated clearly at his season-ending news conference, was not top of mind with many fans on Friday.</p>
<p>But the fact is, Prendergast, a well-respected hockey man who had worked for the Oilers for 20 years, was not a fit as Tambellini's second-in-command. The relationship between the GM and Prendergast was not a warm one; they did not share the same vision for the franchise. That change was necessary.</p>
<p>As for Ken Lowe, Stafford and Kulchisky, saying goodbye to them is a bit like watching Norm, Woody and Frasier walk out of Cheers for the last time.</p>
<p>Hey, wait a minute here, these guys are part of the furniture, aren't they? They're Oilers to the core, valued ones, beloved actually, for those of you secure enough to express such emotions.</p>
<p>Well, certainly. But if Tambellini is going to reconstruct a winning culture, top-to-bottom, then changing the fixtures in the Oilers locker-room is a basic component of that change. Which is not to suggest, in the slightest, that any of the three men dismissed was contributing in any negative way in the locker-room. Far from it.</p>
<p>Nor is there any suggested cause-and-effect between the 531 mangames lost to injury and the ouster of Ken Lowe. In the main, the majority of games lost this past season were either owing to traumatic injuries like Sheldon Souray's concussion and broken hand, like Ales Hemsky (shoulder surgery) and Ladislav Smid (neck surgery) slamming into the boards, like swine flu taking down a handful of players, or both flu and mononucleosis sidelining Mike Comrie.</p>
<p>No, this personnel change is part of a larger organizational overhaul that is not yet complete.</p>
<p>On Friday, though, the sense of unfairness was both real and powerful, and that's understandable; not to mention a well-earned tribute to three good, hard-working men.</p>
<p>The outrage over what is, in many respects, a normal and healthy part of organizational change will fade, you would think.</p>
<p>Less likely to fade on its own is the public's feeling that Kevin Lowe, however complicated and difficult the circumstances, was at the helm as the team plummeted from Game 7 of the Stanley Cup final to the gutter.</p>
<p>In the past, Lowe has said the trading of Ryan Smyth was a mistake, for example. More recently, during a radio interview, he acknowledged his role in the decline of the team's fortunes, but in a sort of generic way.</p>
<p>For some, a more complete mea culpa and fuller explanation of his current role might assuage public anger.</p>
<p>Others believe he should have been out the door before his brother, Stafford and Kulchisky.</p>
<p>The reality is that Kevin Lowe is a capable, well-respected hockey executive and remains solidly supported by Oilers owner Daryl Katz.</p>
<p>It remains unclear how the Oilers will patch up this organizational fault line.</p>
<p>But its ongoing impact on the franchise was never more clear than they day the club kicked three good ol' boys off the bus.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Oilers clean house; Latest to go are three longtime support staff members with a combined 80 years of service</b>
</div><div>Jim Matheson   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>819 words</div><div>24 April 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>OK, here's the scorecard. Kevin Prendergast, gone. Ken Lowe, gone. Barrie Stafford, gone. Lyle Kulchisky, gone.</p>
<p>That's the four longest-serving Edmonton Oilers employees who have lost their jobs since the season ended three weeks ago.</p>
<p>While Prendergast, who was here for 20 years, had some warts as assistant general manager and before that as chief scout, fans may be wondering what the trainer Lowe, the head equipment manager Stafford and his colourful assistant Kulchisky had to do with finishing in 30th and last place in the NHL this season.</p>
<p>Change comes in every workplace but, so far, every player still has his job.</p>
<p>The Oilers say Lowe resigned, but that might not be totally correct. The other two were let go.</p>
<p>All three heart-and-soul guys, who have a combined 80 years service with the Oilers, have been offered other as-yet-unnamed positions in the organization, if they want to take them.</p>
<p>They may all do so, but the changes didn't sit well with one member of the glorified past who helped build the team.</p>
<p>"Firing hockey personnel is one thing, but the training staff, which is second to none, is disgraceful in my opinion," Oilers former head scout Barry Fraser said in an e-mail from his home in Mexico.</p>
<p>"Are they all no good? The ultimate disgraceful act would be if they fired Joey (Moss)."</p>
<p>Moss, who has Down syndrome, is still going to be part of the staff, according to Stafford. He's got a lifetime contract and will be around when training camp opens in September. But who's going to look after him? Kulchisky took Moss under his wing when Wayne Gretzky was starting his career with the Oilers and going out with Moss's sister, Vicki. He's been a big brother to Moss.</p>
<p>The Oilers put out a statement Friday afternoon, saying the organization was undergoing "significant changes" and hoped their former support staff members' skills could be used as a resource in another part of the organization.</p>
<p>GM Steve Tambellini and Ken <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> brother, Kevin, the president of hockey operations, were the bearers of the bad tidings to the training staff.</p>
<p>"In our hearts, they will be Oilers forever," said Tambellini. "These men have made significant contributions to our franchise over many years. I acknowledge their many accomplishments and support."</p>
<p>"We're all diehard Oilers," said Stafford, who is fine with his career shift.</p>
<p>Lowe just finished his 21st season as head trainer, after eight years with the Edmonton Eskimos football team, and several times has worked internationally for Canada, including two Olympics.</p>
<p>Stafford has worked more than 2,000 NHL games, countless Team Canada assignments and 28 years as the Oilers equipment manager.</p>
<p>Kulchisky started with the Oilers in the World Hockey Association and just completed his 31st NHL season, looking after equipment and also trucking the visiting stuff from airport to the rink night after night.</p>
<p>In <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> case, the Oilers led the league in mangames lost this season, more than 570, but there were surgeries -- back (Nikolai Khabibulin, J.F. Jacques), shoulder (Ales Hemsky), neck (Ladislav Smid) -- the broken hand and concussion of Sheldon Souray, swine flu and mononucleosis (Mike Comrie).</p>
<p>All are things a trainer can't control.</p>
<p>Lowe was philosophical on Friday, even if the moves stung. He bleeds Oilers orange and blue, or whatever colour jersey the team wears. He's loved his job for two decades and the opportunities it has given him internationally.</p>
<p>"I hope they have something for me. If not, I'll move on. I've worked with a lot of great athletes ... two Canada Cups, two Olympics, world championship, a Stanley Cup (1990) and the Grey Cups before that," said Lowe, who jumped over the boards night after night to race across the ice in his sneakers to attend to fallen players.</p>
<p>He was only really hurt once, himself.</p>
<p>"Broke my foot in New York, on the bench, when it got stuck," he said.</p>
<p>Stafford, who could have some major input with the Oklahoma City farm club, is looking forward to the career shift.</p>
<p>"It's a bit of a surprise, but I've been around this business a long time. Typically, it doesn't happen to people in our positions, but changes come around," he said. "I have no regrets leaving like this, none at all. We're valued as employees.</p>
<p>"They say they'll create a position for me ... I think this is an exciting opportunity for me. I like where the team seems to be going. I'm on board."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Record donation puts U of A on par with best; Renamed Li Ka Shing institute may deliver cures on global scale</b>
</div><div>Jodie Sinnema   </div>

<div>584 words</div><div>24 April 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>The University of Alberta's laboratory that studies viruses such as HIV, hepatitis, SARS and H1N1 was on Friday renamed the Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology, after the foundation's Canadian arm made the largest single donation in the university's history.</p>
<p>That $28-million donation, plus $52.5 million from the province, has already boosted the virology institute's reputation and helped recruit a world-renowned virologist from San Francisco who discovered the hepatitis C virus in 1987.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Houghton, a private consultant in the biotechnology industry and former scientific director of a company that developed therapies for infectious disease, will start work in Edmonton June 1st.</p>
<p>"I don't think there is anybody we could have got that is better," said Dr. Philip Baker, dean of the U of A's medical school.</p>
<p>More experts like Houghton are expected to be attracted to Edmonton as the Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology grows and develops new drugs, vaccines and diagnostic tests to reduce the impact of viruses such as hepatitis or swine flu.</p>
<p>"It is completely transformative, a paradigm shift that puts us at the cutting edge of discoveries of virology in the world," said U of A president Indira Samarasekera. "It puts us in the league of universities like Stanford, Berkeley, Oxford and Cambridge because we will be part of a Li Ka Shing network of global centres."</p>
<p>Li Ka-shing is a Hong Kong-based businessman with operations in 54 countries. His business interests range from property development to hotels, telecommunications, energy, media and biotechnology. He's a majority shareholder in <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>. and created his Canadian foundation after divesting his entire stake in CIBC in 2005, dedicating all the proceeds to charitable work.</p>
<p>Foundations established by Li have contributed $1.45 billion US. His Canadian foundation has also supported St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and the University of Calgary.</p>
<p>Frank Sixt, president of the Li Ka Shing (Canada) Foundation, said Li chose to invest at the U of A because of its reputation as a research leader on viruses. For instance, Dr. Lorne Tyrell, former medical dean, developed the first oral antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis B. Others are researching how some viruses leap from animals to humans and how other viruses cause cancer.</p>
<p>"What the university has done is attractive to many of the best people," said Sixt, noting the university already has a partnership with the Li Ka Shing-founded Shantou University in southeast China. Of the $25-million donation, $3 million will enhance that Alberta-China partnership by creating a doctoral exchange program that will allow medical students in both countries to collaborate.</p>
<p>"We just decided this was the right combination for the Li Ka Shing Foundation to invest our philanthropic dollars to see how much we can do in the field of virology to improve prevention and cures."</p>
<p>Sixt said, "One need only think of the threat to human well-being posed by virus pandemics, SARS, avian flu, swine flu, the next unidentified killer to see how today's gift has the potential to be transformative in the lives literally millions of individuals."</p>
<p>He said the institute will move research discoveries to patients, increase prevention and deliver cures faster "not just in Alberta ... but maybe on a global scale."</p>

<p>PART 33: LA BUREAUCRATIE (BUREAUCRACY)</p>
<p>On the last Tuesday before Easter break, there was a sign up at Ecole Victor Hugo. An illness, a virus, a bacterial outbreak, something had been detected at the school. I didn't recognize the word. I rarely know medical terms and, with a spectacular lack of humility, I made an assumption: the mumps. Last time it was chickenpox. My response, as I said hello to my fellow parents, was simple: Avia's had her shots.</p>
<p>It took me a week to look up the word, on the day Gina found several tiny, sandy-coloured insects in Avia's hair: les poux.</p>
<p>There are doctors in France, but pharmacists have cured most of the ailments we have suffered in our various trips here: gastrointestinal troubles, goopy eye, bug bites, ear infections, sea urchin attacks.</p>
<p>I went straight to the Pharmacie des Halles with one of the bugs. The wind screeched in from the ocean and blew it away, but I was able to describe it to the pharmacists. They chose the latest and best medicine for lice, a pharmaceutical version of "the mayonnaise treatment" that has the advantage of not being mayonnaise. You massage white goop in your hair and leave it for eight hours, smothering the bugs to death.</p>
<p>It was 18 euros for one application.</p>
<p>"They aren't giving it away," said one of the pharmacists.</p>
<p>"You'll have to wash everything she touched," said the other.</p>
<p>"Bon courage," they said, in chorus.</p>
<p>It's not like we've avoided doctors. We've seen several, against the advice of many French people. The trouble with doctors is, like most professionals affiliated with the government, they come with paperwork. As we planned this unearned sabbatical, every French citizen whose counsel we sought congratulated us for spending a year in their country. The only thing that ought to frustrate us, they said, apart from the strikes and the strength of the euro, and Jean-Marie Le Pen, and British people everywhere, was the gigantic, all-encompassing bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Karine, my friend in Strasbourg, told stories of waiting in line for hours at the post office. When we decided to buy a car, rather than keep renting, she took a deep, worried breath. "You'll have to go to the prefecture for a carte grise."</p>
<p>This is the registration card. "It'll take a while, you think?"</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Karine shook her head. It was as though she had heard one of my few remaining relatives had died. "I'm so sorry."</p>
<p>The prefecture in my former department, the Vaucluse, was in Avignon. However, I learned that I could get a carte grise from the sousprefecture in Carpentras, a smaller city closer to Vaison-la-Romaine, on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons. While I had bought the car, it was not yet registered in my name. I asked the man at the garage if he thought it was a big deal to drive 40 minutes south with a car that was not yet officially mine.</p>
<p>"It depends. Do you like prison?"</p>
<p>I took the Wednesday bus to Carpentras, the strawberry capital of the south. Expecting the worst, I packed lunch and dinner, two books, a tiny bottle of wine, a newspaper and my computer. I had priced out the hotels. The sous-prefecture is on a winding, medieval street downtown. In the courtyard behind the building there were palm trees and potted ferns.</p>
<p>"It must be pleasant to work here!" I said, to the front-line clerk.</p>
<p>"You're not French, I imagine." She handed me a number: 89. I found an empty chair and took out a banana and my book. It was 1:30. I looked around at the others, waiting with me. They had cellphones and shopping bags. Many of them scowled, but I had never been so cheerful about a long wait. Usually, in government-related lineups, I am a premium scowler.</p>
<p>The secret, I had decided, was to be prepared. To live without hope. To expect the very worst. Europe was making me limber and more patient, understanding of ...</p>
<p>"Number 89."</p>
<p>I hadn't even read a paragraph of Harry Potter a l'ecole des sorciers. The banana was unpeeled. I soft-shoed to the front-line clerk. "Maybe there's been a mistake."</p>
<p>"What sort of mistake?"</p>
<p>"I heard 89. I'm 89. I just arrived."</p>
<p>The automatic doors opened and I was welcomed by a bank of clerks. A cheerful, gorgeous woman waved me over. I lacked something important: proof of residence. All I had was a grammatically suspect, unsigned letter from my crazy American landlord. I began to make excuses, to apologize, to compliment her thoroughness.</p>
<p>"It's no big deal," said the woman. Ten minutes and several hundred euros later, I had a carte grise.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Once we had massaged the lice goop into Avia's hair, we set about washing all of her clothes and bedsheets and doudous. The washing machine is tiny, this being Europe, and we only have enough hot water for either one load of clothes or one shower per day.</p>
<p>I had asked our landlord about this. Do we share a hot water tank with our neighbours downstairs, or all of central Douarnenez?</p>
<p>"No," said Jean-Michel. "It's a nice, big, hot water tank, very modern. It's perfect."</p>
<p>We inspected Esme's hair. I looked in Gina's hair and she looked in mine. Nothing the first day. Nothing the second. At 9:15 p.m. on Thursday, Gina insisted I look in her hair one last time. And that is when I found it.</p>
<p>"Oh no," I said.</p>
<p>"No!" she said.</p>
<p>I ran to Pharmacie des Halles for four more 18-euro treatments while Gina mourned. It was closed. A sign on the window said the pharmacy "on guard" was down the street. It was closed. But it had a sign on the window too. If it was a true emergency, and I had a prescription, I could go to the gendarmerie -- the police station -- and they would help me.</p>
<p>The gendarmerie was locked, but there was an intercom. I pressed the button and a young man who had wisely shaved his head came to the door.</p>
<p>I approached him. "My whole family has lice."</p>
<p>The police officer put up his hand, motioning me to take a step back.</p>
<p>"And all the pharmacies are closed," I said.</p>
<p>"You have a prescription?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Go to the emergency department."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Courage," he said.</p>
<p>The H1N1 crisis was never really a crisis here. The French are too cool. If it weren't for some friends and family members in Canada suggesting it was the second coming of the black plague, we probably wouldn't have thought much of it. For the first while, we didn't bother with the vaccine because, as Canadians, I didn't see how we could get it.</p>
<p>Finally, after our loved ones on the telephone had succeeded in making us worry for our children's lives, we collected our paperwork and showed up at the immunization centre. Bambi was playing for the youngsters. There were four other people in the waiting room.</p>
<p>"I'm sure you can't immunize us, because we're a family of Canadians living in France."</p>
<p>"Fill out this paperwork."</p>
<p>"You mean, you can immunize us?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"But we're not French," I started, and gave him several good legal and financial reasons why he should be cautious. My mom was visiting. She didn't even have a French visa. She could be a terrorist for all they knew. The gentleman took me down the hall to see the doctor in charge. I explained how they couldn't possibly have anything to do with us. Surely I would need a note from my doctor translated into French, stamped in Paris, notarized in Vichy, photocopied in Honfleur ...</p>
<p>"Oh no, Canadians," said the doctor in charge. "Immunize them before they infect us all!"</p>
<p>Everyone in the room laughed. Did I want some coffee? A hard-boiled egg? Fifteen minutes later, we were on our way home.</p>
<p>Last Thursday night, her hair full of poux, Gina drove to the hospital. A nurse informed her that lice didn't count as a medical emergency. Misconceptions abound, about lice and about France. One of our Englishspeaking friends here told us, a week after learning we were infested with poux, "You know what? Apparently you don't even have to be dirty to get it."</p>
<p>"The gendarme sent us," Gina told the nurse.</p>
<p>Perhaps our haplessness is endearing. The rule, when you first arrive in France, is to apply for a carte de sejour, your French identity card. In the war movies, when a soldier asks a shivering Frenchman for his papers, this is what the soldier means. In Avignon, when I said we were moving to Brittany, they said to apply for a carte de sejour at the prefecture in Quimper when we arrived.</p>
<p>"But our visas will run out."</p>
<p>"Has anyone ever looked at your visa?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"So don't worry."</p>
<p>We still don't have our cartes de sejour, but we have paperwork that suggests they're on the way. This paperwork expires. When I forgot to apply for an extension for the paperwork that suggests the cartes de sejour are on the way, the man at city hall, in Douarnenez, put his hand on my arm.</p>
<p>"Are you moving away from the department?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then don't worry. We know you here. You're taken care of. And if you want to stay longer, just let us know."</p>
<p>"Really? I could stay longer?"</p>
<p>"As long as you like. Just give us some advance notice."</p>
<p>I told them what we had been told, about the impossible, intransigent, surreal bureaucracy that makes every official step in French life ridiculous. The people at city hall looked around at each other. Yes, it is terrible. Unbelievable. Something must change, and soon.</p>
<p>At the hospital, on the night we discovered the bugs in Gina's hair, and eventually mine, we knew there were two options. We could insist, or cry, and the nurse would give us what we wanted despite the apparent rigidity of the French bureaucracy. Why? Because people in France, like everywhere else, feel good when they have helped someone in distress.</p>
<p>"The pharmacies open at 9," said the nurse.</p>
<p>Gina didn't cry. She didn't ask for just one little bottle of poux killer, one teensy bottle, please please oh please, which had been her plan. "All right," she said.</p>
<p>The nurse went into a closet in the back and came out with two lace hats that would keep the bugs from escaping from our infested hair in the night. "Bon courage."</p>

<p>TORONTO Canadian travellers who are stranded in Europe by the volcanic ash cloud are not necessarily out of pocket if they began their journey with travel insurance, but they need to check their policies. The team answering calls at RBC Insurance is running "full out," a company executive said this week.</p>
<p>"If people have purchased cancellation and interruption insurance in their travel insurance, whether it be in a package or stand-alone basis, they're likely to have some type of benefit related to this particular event, the volcanic ash volcano in Iceland," said Tim Bzowey, vice-president of travel.</p>
<p>Silvana Aceto, speaking for the CAA south-central Ontario office in Thornhill, said her region has been dealing with 58 passengers who are stuck in Europe, and who booked trips through the company.</p>
<p>RBC Insurance has had contact with a "significant number" of people in Europe, but Bzowey couldn't offer an exact count.</p>
<p>It's all hands on deck at the 24-7 insurance office, he said.</p>
<p>"Thankfully we're accustomed to crises in the travel business, whether it's a tour operator failure or an airline failure, SARS, H1N1, 9-11, earthquakes, tsunamis -- these are all events that have happened in the recent past ... but every time one of these comes up, it's a little bit different.</p>
<p>"And I never in my career would have anticipated a volcano in Iceland would be an issue for us."</p>
<p>Any RBC policyholder currently in Europe and unable to get home when they planned will automatically have their coverage extended, he said.</p>
<p>"There's been no additional cost for that."</p>
<p>There is an allowance to cover meals, accommodation, phone calls, taxis and car rental, with the deluxe package allowing for a maximum of $700 to be spent.</p>
<p>Bzowey agreed that the money "absolutely isn't" going to last a traveller long if they need a hotel room for five days.</p>
<p>"This is why these situations aren't easy and we want to get people home as soon as practically possible," he said.</p>
<p>In most cases, the $700 is more than enough when the main goal is to get a client home as quickly and safely as possible, the company said. Bzowey commended the airlines for doing "the best they can in a difficult situation."</p>
<p>"We're encouraging all of our clients to check with their airline, check with their tour operator, make sure that communication is open because the situation is quite dynamic, and what might be the situation today could be very different tomorrow," he said.</p>
<p>The same goes for Canadians stuck on this side of the pond who booked their flights to Europe prior to April 15.</p>
<p>They need to talk to the airline and tour operator about changing their dates if the ash situation improves, Bzowey said, and if that's not possible, then they need to open a claim.</p>
