<p>Air Canada plane makes emergency landing in Calgary</p>
<p>An Air Canada passenger plane flying from Calgary to Toronto on Thursday was forced to turn back due to a problem with its hydraulics system. Flight 1150 with 158 people on board landed safely at the <span class="companylink">Calgary International Airport</span>. No one was injured. Air Canada spokesperson Angela Mah said the captain turned back because instruments were indicating a mechanical problem. Poirier described tense moments as the airport activated its emergency services and waited for the plane to land. All the airport's firefighting crews as well as 13 ambulances were on standby.</p>

<p>Canadians to get second chance to get H1N1 flu shot</p>
<p>Canadians who chose not to be immunized against H1N1 during the pandemic will have another shot at getting protected with this year's seasonal flu vaccine. Next week, provinces and territories will begin rolling out the vaccine that protects against H1N1 and two other flu strains. The Public Health Agency of Canada has ordered more than eleven million doses at a cost of about $40 million to $45 million. Health officials are encouraging all Canadians over six months of age to get the shot. The mid-October rollout will allow people who get vaccinated to build up protective antibodies before flu begins its annual assault roughly six to eight weeks from now.</p>

<p>TORONTO -- Canadians who chose not to be immunized against H1N1 during the pandemic will have another shot at getting protected with this year's seasonal flu vaccination.</p>
<p>Next week, provinces and territories across the country will begin rolling out the 2010-11 vaccine, which includes H1N1A and two other strains - H3N2 influenza A Perth and influenza B Brisbane.</p>
<p>All children over six months old and adults of all ages are encouraged to get a flu shot, the senior medical adviser for the Public Health Agency of Canada says.</p>
<p>"It will protect you against the pandemic H1N1 strain, for example," said Dr. Patricia Huston. "But we anticipate it will be a new H3N2 strain that will be circulating this year, so previous flu vaccines will not cover you for that."</p>
<p>And, she says, there's "no harm in having a repeat vaccine or a booster, and it will protect you for the new strains that may be coming out."</p>
<p>Provinces and territories began shipping vaccine last month to their health units.</p>

</p>
<p>A former Regina travel agent and convicted con woman can be discharged from bankruptcy for the price of $10,000 -- but it's taken a much bigger toll on those rooked by her schemes.</p>
<p>A court order recently made Angela Sui Ping Lok's bankruptcy conditional on her paying $10,000 for the benefit of her creditors, whose losses are 30 times that amount.</p>
<p>The 67-year-old widow and former owner of Trade Winds Travel currently lives on an old age pension of $1,600 a month.</p>
<p>Even if the $10,000 is paid, it won't go far to recouping losses sustained by her numerous creditors, including one man who lost $50,000 as a result of trusting Lok with his credit card. He works two jobs and had to take out a mortgage to pay off the debt racked up by Lok.</p>
<p>"I trusted her. She talked so good," said a former friend that Lok called "Uncle Joe."</p>
<p>He noted Lok was well known in the Asian community and often helped organize cultural events. Now he, along with others who lost money, feel deeply betrayed.</p>
<p>"I don't believe she could do that to me," added Joe, who asked that his full name not be used.</p>
<p>He's resigned himself to never getting his money back.</p>
<p>"I cannot understand how she can get away with stuff like that, to apply for bankruptcy and just forget about everything ... What she's done to people is unbelievable," he said.</p>
<p>Lok told the bankruptcy hearing that her fragile mental and physical state prevent her from working. She had begged to be discharged without any monetary conditions attached.</p>
<p>But in her written decision, registrar in bankruptcy Lian Schwann said she was persuaded that a conditional order was appropriate given the circumstances and the fact many of the creditors were not corporations but individuals, including friends, those from her cultural community, and other who simply trusted her with their funds.</p>
<p>"What's striking about her bankruptcy is the fact the bulk of her debts arose from illegal or improper schemes which collectively offend commercial morality. Lok's conduct was reprehensible in a commercial sense and cannot be disregarded," Schwann said.</p>
<p>"The (bankruptcy) system would be undermined if I were to grant discharge without a financial penalty," she added.</p>
<p>Concurrent with the financial penalty, the discharge is suspended for 36 months. Once discharged, a debtor is released from the obligation to repay most debts -- court-ordered fines are excluded, for example -- incurred as of the date of bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p>Lok's downtown travel agency suddenly closed in August last year. Within days, she filed for personal bankruptcy, claiming debts of $336,910 owed to 27 creditors and assets of only $18,000, the bulk of which was a vehicle that was expected to be reclaimed by the financing company.</p>
<p>Lok blamed the bankruptcy -- her second since 1996 -- on a downturn in business caused by 9/11, SARS, and H1N1.</p>
<p>The Office of the Superintendent in Bankruptcy (OSB) asked the RCMP to investigate and charges were laid in May.</p>
<p>Lok was given an 18-month conditional sentence, including three months of house arrest and 100 hours of community service, in July after pleading guilty to three counts of fraud. The charges stemmed from her using false pretences to get a loan, overcharging one client, and using another client's money to pay for someone else's travel. She was ordered to pay restitution of $24,397 to the three victims -- but they represented only a fraction of those who lost money.</p>
<p>Beyond those victims were the so-called "Air Miles creditors" who lost $185,000. According to the decision, Lok persuaded friends and customers to allow her unfettered use of their credit cards for travel bookings unrelated to their own personal travel. In return, the card holders would generate air miles. Lok even persuaded some to up their credit limits. The scheme worked until she quit paying off the debts, leaving the cardholders on the hook.</p>
<p>Another $12,000 was lost by charities that were promised sponsorships or donations they never received.</p>
<p>"I don't understand where the money's gone? That's the question I'd like to ask," said Joe.</p>
<p>Under oath, Lok admitted some of the money was spent on gambling, but she was unable to estimate how much.</p>
<p>"Lok expressed extreme remorse for what happened," says the ruling.</p>

<p>Paris --</p>
<p>The French Football League (LFP) has banned away fans from attending Ligue 1 clashes between champions Olympique Marseille and Paris St Germain, citing security reasons following violent clashes between rival fans.</p>
<p>“Competitions commission decided on Thursday to close the away fans terraces to Marseille fans for the PSG-OM game ... and the away fans terraces to Paris fans for the OM-PSG fixture,” the LFP said on their website (www.lfp.fr[http://www.lfp.fr]).</p>
<p>“The target of this measure (...) is to assure best security to all after the serious incidents that took place last season,” the LFP said, adding that authorities had been informed.</p>
<p>The teams are scheduled to play in Paris on Nov. 7 with the return match in Marseilles on March 19.</p>
<p>Fans from the arch-rival clubs clashed in Marseille streets last year then confronted police after their first game of last season was postponed hours before kick-off due to an outbreak of swine flu in the PSG team.</p>
<p>A clash between rival groups of PSG fans before the teams’ return match in Paris in February led to the fatal beating of a fan and prompted the club to stop selling tickets for away matches for the rest of the season.</p>

<p>This year's seasonal flu shots will contain an agent protecting against H1N1 swine flu, but the mass vaccination campaign of last season won't be repeated.</p>
<p>Dr. Dee Hoyano, medical health officer for the Vancouver Island Health Authority, said the new vaccine will contain agents to protect against three flu varieties: H1N1 and two others that have been in recent circulation in North America.</p>
<p>But unlike last year, when the province was facing what was then a previously unknown strain of flu, H1N1, this year the strains have all been encountered before. As a result, the vaccination campaign, which kicks off Oct. 18, will be much more low key.</p>
<p>"It's a return to our usual flu vaccination campaign in terms of what we are expecting," said Hoyano.</p>
<p>So unlike last year's campaign, when the province attempted to distribute 4.3 million vaccination doses free for everyone in B.C., this year some will have to pay.</p>
<p>Eligible for free vaccines are people over 65, children younger than two, people with chronic health conditions, health-care workers and others living in close contact with people at risk.</p>
<p>But instead of mass clinics operating in places like donated space in shopping malls, free vaccinations will be administered by family physicians and in public health clinics and facilities.</p>
<p>Those who have to pay for their vaccines can get them from various clinics and pharmacies. In past years, the cost of a flu vaccine has ranged from $15 to $20.</p>
<p>But despite the winding down of the mass vaccination campaign, Hoyano said getting a flu vaccine remains a good idea for everyone.</p>
<p>"Vaccines are a benefit for everyone, healthy people and people at risk," she said. "It saves getting a pretty bad sickness, losing a couple of days of work. It's a benefit for everyone."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccinate infants against rotavirus: pediatricians</b>
</div><div>CARLY WEEKS   </div>
<div>571 words</div><div>5 October 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>L4</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>An influential organization representing pediatricians across Canada has issued a call for all infants to be vaccinated against rotavirus.</p>
<p>The Canadian Paediatric Society, which announced the recommendation Monday, is also urging governments across the country to begin funding the rotavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>The recommendation is being made to help protect infants from contracting rotavirus, a nasty bug that is the most common cause of diarrhea in babies and children. Up to 600 children afflicted with rotavirus are hospitalized in Canada each year, according to the Canadian Paediatric Society. It's a major cause of illness and death in developing countries.</p>
<p>But the call for a new vaccine to be added to the immunization schedule for children could be met with skepticism from some parents. A backlash against vaccines has been brewing in recent years, typically over fears they can lead to harmful side effects.</p>
<p>Although many of those fears, such as the link between vaccines and autism, have repeatedly been proven false by rigorous scientific studies, many parents remain wary of vaccines, a trend that came to the forefront last year amid the debate over whether to vaccinate children against H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>But Joan Robinson, a member of the Canadian Paediatric Society's infectious disease and immunization committee who is also an infectious diseases physician in Edmonton, said parents shouldn't put their children in harm's way because of concerns vaccines could be a theoretical health threat.</p>
<p>“How can getting a low dose of a virus that's made to be weak or wimpy be more dangerous than actually getting the infection?” Dr. Robinson said. “In every single case the benefit of the vaccine is thought to be way greater than the risk.”</p>
<p>It doesn't help that there have been some safety issues identified with rotavirus vaccines in the past.</p>
<p>In late September, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration updated the label on a rotavirus vaccine called Rotarix after a study linked it to a slight increase in the risk of intussusception, an intestinal condition that can lead to blockage. Regulators said the risk would translate into a maximum of four additional hospitalizations for every 100,000 infants within 31 days of receiving the first dose of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Health Canada also began investigating rotavirus vaccines earlier this year after contaminants were found in the two approved for sale here, Rotarix and RotaTeq. The department said porcine circovirus, a virus commonly found in pigs that could be a contaminant of an enzyme from pig pancreas, were detected in the vaccines. Although the virus is not known to cause illness in humans, Health Canada said the labels on rotavirus vaccines have been updated to warn about the presence of porcine circovirus.</p>
<p>Another major challenge stands in the way of mass vaccination against rotavirus: Many parents have never heard of it.</p>
<p>A 2007 survey of more than 800 mothers conducted on behalf of the Canadian Institute of Child Health found that more than half had never heard of rotavirus, while one in six reported their child had experienced symptoms of rotavirus in the past.</p>
<p>Yet nearly all children will contract the virus in their first few years of life, Dr. Robinson said.</p>
<p>“I think we need to emphasize that certainly for this one, if they don't get the vaccine they 100 per cent virtually will actually get rotavirus,” she said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The scars from H1N1 remain; My son used to be athletic and energetic. After battling H1N1 last year, he's now winded by walking up a flight of steps</b>
</div><div>DEBORAH FOLKA   </div>
<div>1032 words</div><div>4 October 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>L8</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>The H1N1 pandemic is over, but for those who suffered through the disease or watched loved ones ill with it, the scars remain.</p>
<p>My 25-year-old son was felled by H1N1 last October and though he survived, his ability to breathe is severely limited by permanent scars the virus left in his lungs. Previously athletic and energetic, he's now winded by walking up a flight of steps.</p>
<p>The same medical experts who didn't know exactly how to treat this virulent disease now don't know exactly how long recovery takes or if victims will ever completely get well. All they can say is it may take up to two years to recover from H1N1 and some effects may be long-lasting or lifelong.</p>
<p>I hope and pray my son experiences a total recuperation, but as his mother I know I will never get over the experience of watching him fight the disease.</p>
<p>Our nightmare began with a phone call at 3 a.m. from a doctor in the intensive care unit of Edmonton's Royal Alexandra Hospital. Lindsey had been admitted with what they were assuming was H1N1 and he was on a ventilator in a medically induced coma. The doctor said I needed to come soon: “If it were my kid, I'd get here right away.”</p>
<p>The dark, rain-soaked ride to the Vancouver airport at 4 a.m. was surreal. We caught the first flight out at 6:30 a.m., and after an interminable cab ride from Edmonton's airport, we arrived at the hospital by 9 a.m.</p>
<p>We were met by a doctor at the door to Lindsey's ICU room. He explained Lindsey was ill with what they were assuming was H1N1, although it would take a few days for the lab to confirm it. A friend had brought Lindsey to the hospital's emergency room the night before and his condition had deteriorated rapidly.</p>
<p>“Within a couple of hours, he could no longer breathe on his own,” the doctor said. “We put a tube down his throat so the ventilator can do that work for him. He was conscious long enough for us to explain it and now we will keep him deeply sedated so his lungs can accept the help. We're giving him antibiotics to fight the H1N1, as well as fluids to hydrate him.”</p>
<p>He was also running a high temperature, so they had put him on a bed of ice and removed his gown, leaving a small towel across his front.</p>
<p>“Are you ready to see him now?” the doctor asked.</p>
<p>We put on gowns, gloves, masks and eye shields and the doctor slid open the heavy glass door.</p>
<p>There was my son stretched out on a bed, his head slightly elevated. In addition to the breathing apparatus covering his mouth, I counted nine tubes and lines attached to his body. His eyes were closed and he was very, very still. The only sound in the room, after we closed the door, was the artificial hissing of the ventilator.</p>
<p>I approached the bed and tried to blink back the tears that were blurring my vision. I wanted to take his hand, but both of them had medical apparatus attached. I stroked his arm and whispered to him. He didn't respond.</p>
<p>Confirmed a few days later with both H1N1 and influenza A, Lindsey lay paralyzed for more than two weeks, occasionally twitching or opening his eyes, but for the most part uncannily still. Once he squeezed my hand. It may have been just a reflex, but the nurses told me he could hear, so I chose to believe he knew I was there.</p>
<p>He didn't like it when the nurses shaved him and no matter how gentle they were, he groaned and tried to turn his head. I put lotion on his hands, feet and forehead, wiped his dry, cracked lips and made sure his blankets were tucked in after the fever broke. I became adept at one-sided conversation. I sang songs from his childhood, recited poems and read passages from a prayer book.</p>
<p>Because of the dangers of infection and contamination in the ICU – especially with H1N1 – the usual hospital comforts of pictures, flowers and books were forbidden, but I smuggled in a photo of Lindsey with me and his grandmother at his graduation.</p>
<p>Visitors were restricted to family only, so his grandmother and I took turns by his bedside. After the initial shock, it was amazing how swiftly we adapted to the routine of going to the hospital, gowning up, reviewing his status with the nurses and sitting with him. We talked about him and talked to him, but often just sat watching him, willing him to live.</p>
<p>Time stands still in the isolation of the ICU; you snatch sleep where you can and yet still feel disoriented and often terrified.</p>
<p>After almost three weeks of this suspended animation, the doctors explained they needed to make a decision about Lindsey's care: whether to keep him sedated or try to bring him off the ventilator to see if he could breathe on his own. If he couldn't, they would do a tracheotomy and put the ventilator tube through a hole in his throat.</p>
<p>When I entered the ICU the next day, I was greeted with big smiles. “I have an early Christmas present for you,” the attending doctor said. He walked me down the corridor and with a flourish pointed to Lindsey's room.</p>
<p>There was my son, sitting up, the ventilator tube removed. His eyes were open wide, and though he looked dopey, he was smiling. He saw me and his grin widened.</p>
<p>I laughed, I cried and my hands shook as I struggled through the gown and gloves routine. My son was awake. Everything was going to be okay.</p>

<p>Provincial health authorities hope to immunize as many Albertans against the seasonal flu this winter as they did during last year's H1N1 campaign.</p>
<p>During 2009's H1N1 pandemic, just 36 per cent of Albertans opted to be vaccinated, the health region said Friday. But compared to regular seasonal flu campaigns, which normally draw about 20 per cent, that was considered high.</p>
<p>"Last year was a big increase, so we're aiming to reach at least as many people as were done last year," said Dr. Andrew Corriveau, chief medical officer of health with Alberta Health Services.</p>
<p>For the second year, public health clinics will offer free shots to anyone who wants them, from six-month-old infants to senior citizens.</p>
<p>Last fall, high demand and a shortage of H1N1 vaccine forced Alberta to temporarily close clinics before gradually offering shots to the public, beginning with those at highest risk.</p>
<p>Controversy over the government's handling of the immunization program led the province to order an audit that is expected to be turned over to Alberta Health by the end of next week.</p>
<p>Calgary will have six flu clinics open starting Oct. 12, with five remaining open until mid-December. Last year, seven clinics were opened to meet demand for the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services has ordered 800,000 doses of the vaccine that will target the H3N2 strain of influenza A, as well as influenza B and H1N1 in a single shot.</p>
<p>"We still expect to see some (H1N1) continue to circulate, albeit at lower levels of activity because many people are immune from last year," said Corriveau. "It's still expected to be around."</p>
<p>For those who received an H1N1 shot last year or became infected with the disease, this year's vaccination will serve as a booster, said Corriveau.</p>
<p>The decision to combine the three strains into one shot was made based on what was seen in the Southern Hemisphere during the summer.</p>
<p>It's believed one strain will come in a first wave in December and a second strain will hit in February or early March.</p>
<p>Health Minister Gene Zwozdesky doesn't believe last year's H1N1 hype will discourage Albertans from rolling up their sleeves for a needle this year.</p>
<p>"I would encourage people to look seriously at getting their immunizations and getting them done early so that there isn't a long lineup later on, when the flu season really hits," he said.</p>
<p>The Health Quality Council of Alberta conducted the review of the province's H1N1 flu vaccination rollout. Zwozdesky said he expects to receive the report shortly.</p>
<p>"There's some lessons that were learned obviously, and I'm looking forward to reading the report," he said.</p>
<p>More information about the immunization program -- and the times clinics are open -- is available at albertahealthservices.ca.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Get well soon Guelph Reflecting on a one-year pursuit of better wellness</b>
</div><div>1107 words</div><div>2 October 2010</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>It's only coincidence that as I'm wrapping up my one-year series Oh Well, the City of Guelph is beginning its Community Plan on Well-Being.</p>
<p>My examination of wellness was kick-started by the Guelph Wellness Initiative, a project of the Advanced Food and Materials Network. The premise was to encourage citizens to become physically active, socially engaged, emotionally connected, and personally satisfied with their lives.</p>
<p>The idea was to measure participants from the outset, feed them health and wellness information and details about free or inexpensive community events, and set them loose to achieve their goals. Participants were to be measured again at the six-month and one-year marks, their wellness quotients recorded, and from this science, a blueprint to wellness could be devised. I was to be a participant and chronicle the project as well as my own progress in the print and online series Oh Well.</p>
<p>The project was scarcely off the ground when a change in personnel at the Advanced Food and Materials Network and the flurry of activity surrounding the H1N1 vaccine caused it to nosedive.</p>
<p>It's a shame because the wellness initiative might have informed the city's well-being study.</p>
<p>Barb Powell, general manager of community engagement for the city, said the Community Plan for Well-Being will help city departments design and operate the city with the health and well-being of its citizens built into the system.</p>
<p>Such a plan includes things such as installing better lighting so people can walk or jog more safely at night, community gardens and community kitchens to ease grocery budgets.</p>
<p>They're all elements that can help people become healthy.</p>
<p>"It's the natural environment and parks too. But urban design itself can encourage people to interact," Powell said. "Wellness and well-being are very broad concepts."</p>
<p>City staff will consult with neighbourhood groups and other established social centres but hope to connect with voices that aren't always captured in such surveys.</p>
<p>Powell isn't talking about a community centre on every corner. Far from it. The consultation will help determine the needs in neighbourhoods and that will be used for future planning for all departments, from policing to traffic flow to recreation programs and community meeting places.</p>
<p>"It's part of a broad agenda to make Guelph a vibrant, livable city," Powell said.</p>
<p>We could sure use the help.</p>
<p>A Statistics Canada health profile of Wellington, Dufferin and Guelph from June of this year indicates 65.5 per cent of us believe we are in very good or excellent health, and 73.5 per cent of us believe we have very good or excellent mental health. But 54.5 per cent of us are obese or overweight, 19.4 per cent of us smoke, and 21.7 per cent of us are heavy drinkers.</p>
<p>These are the statistics that motivate Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health in its work.</p>
<p>"Our primary focus is prevention," said Jennifer McCorriston, acting program manager of the healthy living team. "We want to keep people healthy so they avoid chronic conditions.</p>
<p>"It's especially important to focus on kids. If we start early, they can build those skills so they'll be healthy adults."</p>
<p>I know that to be true, which is why I let my kids play one sport a season, even when money was tight. If you know how to throw a baseball, kick a soccer ball or skate with ease, you'll be more inclined to play a sport or pursue a fitness plan as an adult.</p>
<p>It's a great move of the federal and provincial governments to make fees for children's sports and other extracurricular activities tax deductible.</p>
<p>"Physical activity is a gateway to health," said Karen Armstrong, co-ordinator of public health's In Motion program. "The more active you become, the more you want a healthy diet, the less you drink, smoke and do drugs. Exercise also decreases depression."</p>
<p>Oct. 2 to 8 is In Motion week - a week of events to encourage citizens to become active. There's the couch potato race for workplace teams on Oct. 6; that day is also International Walk to School day. In Motion is helping the Guelph Community Health Centre to collect gently used running shoes for kids and adults.</p>
<p>Running shoes are the most basic of exercise equipment. Details about what's going on locally can be found at www.wdginmotion.ca[http://www.wdginmotion.ca].</p>
<p>I went down a dress size and got my clicking, creaking body back in alignment these past 12 months by stretching and walking every morning, eating smaller food portions, and adding more vegetables and water to my daily diet.</p>
<p>It hasn't been easy but it wasn't that hard either, and after being pretty consistent for a year it has become a habit. It is also my new minimum. I can certainly do more activity than that but I won't let myself do less.</p>
<p>"It's really important for parents to model an active lifestyle to their children," Armstrong said. "Over half of children with inactive parents will grow up to be inactive adults as well."</p>
<p>While my physical wellness improved over the year, I experienced some wild peaks and valleys on the emotional score and at times even managed to undermine my confidence.</p>
<p>"Wellness doesn't mean everything is super," said Fred Wagner, executive director of Trellis Mental Health and Development Services. "It's not a destination and you never get there. It's an approach to life. It's about taking the longer view."</p>
<p>Don't I know that. I had a long list of wellness activities I thought I'd be embarking on this past year, but in fact only ticked off a few boxes on that to-do list. It was a lesson in biting off more than I could chew.</p>
<p>But I'm not tossing the list. It includes goals that are worthy of achieving and I'm bound to get there. Oh Well has ended but my journey continues.</p>
<p>At the end of the year I've discovered government can create systems to encourage health and wellness, and when they are there, people are more inclined to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>But there has to be personal motivation at the core. We have to take care of ourselves.</p>
<p>So that, Guelph, is my wish for you: to become active, eat healthy food, be engaged in your community and pursue interests that make you feel better.</p>
<p>May you get well soon.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Most Canadians rejected H1N1 shots: report; It was a learning experience, say doctors</b>
</div><div>Bradley Bouzane   </div>
<div>Postmedia News</div>
<div>580 words</div><div>1 October 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Although a clear majority of Canadians opted not to receive the H1N1 shot, the president of the Canadian Medical Association says the process was a learning experience and more effective campaigns for future viral illnesses will likely result.</p>
<p>Responding to new figures from Statistics Canada that indicate that roughly 60 per cent of Canadians aged 12 and over chose to forego the vaccination, Dr. Jeff Turnbull said Thursday that the results weren't shocking. Rather, he saw them as a stepping-stone.</p>
<p>"We had a sense of what those numbers would be from our own communities and our understanding of how the vaccine worked out," Turnbull said. "I would have preferred to see the numbers higher, but I know this was very controversial and involved several components as to how we make vaccines available and how we educate our communities about the importance of vaccination."</p>
<p>About 11.6 million people aged 12 and over got the shot, according to self-reported data from the 2010 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), released Thursday by the federal agency.</p>
<p>Of the roughly 60 per cent who opted against getting vaccinated, the majority -- 74 per cent -- said they "did not think it was necessary."</p>
<p>Vaccination rates vary among specific groups and regions, with health-care workers leading the way with a 66-per-cent vaccination rate. About 55 per cent Canadians suffering from chronic conditions, which placed them on a priority list to receive the shot, chose to take the needle. In contrast, 38 per cent of Canadians who do not suffer from a chronic conditions took the shot.</p>
<p>Considering the aggressive promotion for health-care workers to take the shot to protect themselves and the vulnerable people in their workplaces, Turnbull said 66 per cent was low, but still an improvement over other vaccination programs available to health workers.</p>
<p>"I think that number could and should be higher," Turnbull said. "We've now seen the consequences of the immunization program and nobody is worse for wear because of that -- everybody's worst expectations of the vaccine did not come true.</p>
<p>"I think those concerns have been allayed and I would hope if we saw another H1N1, we'd see people taking up the vaccination rates a little more frequently. Recognize, however, that 66 per cent is often better than what we normally get when we immunize other health professionals (for other conditions). It's better, but it's not good enough and perhaps it will (improve)."</p>
<p>Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's medical officer of health, said late last year that the vaccination threshold for "herd immunity" -- whereby the number of vaccinated people essentially staves off infection of the rest of the population -- varies from 50 to 80 per cent.</p>
<p>The principle of herd immunity suggests vaccination reduces the spread of infectious diseases even in people who haven't been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Effectively vaccinated people are immune to illness and after a certain point, an infectious disease has great difficulty spreading because it keeps running into immune systems that are prepared for it. People can still get sick, but at a much reduced rate.</p>
<p>Canadians who typically received a seasonal flu shot were also more likely to have taken the H1N1 vaccine, the report said. More than three quarters -- 76 per cent -- of Canadians who choose to take a seasonal vaccine also received the H1N1 shot.</p>

</div><div>Rob Ferguson  Toronto Star   </div>
<div>848 words</div><div>1 October 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Ontario is expanding free dental services for poor children to include preventative care such as check-ups, cleanings, X-rays and fillings, the Star has learned.</p>
<p>Health Minister Deb Matthews will announce Friday that the "healthy smiles" program - costing taxpayers $45 million annually - is designed to help 130,000 kids aged 17 and under.</p>
<p>The free services will be available immediately through Ontario's 36 public health units, but parents must first fill out applications and meet eligibility rules - having an family net income below $20,000 and no access to other dental coverage. Details are available at www.ontario.ca/healthysmiles[http://www.ontario.ca/healthysmiles].</p>
<p>The move follows a 2007 investigation by the Star's Moira Welsh which found the working poor, who can't afford dentists, face a slew of health problems and job discrimination because of bad teeth.</p>
<p>The probe prompted a government promise to expand dental care for people in need.</p>
<p>By using the $20,000 income level cut-off, the program is aimed only at the poorest of the working poor, acknowledged Matthews, whose government is fighting a $19.7 billion deficit this year.</p>
<p>"This was the best we could do. The threshold is low but it catches 130,000 kids who wouldn't otherwise be getting care," she told the Star in an exclusive interview Thursday.</p>
<p>"It captures the kids most in need. With the cost of going to the dentist, it's pretty tough for these parents to find that money."</p>
<p>Families on welfare already get dental coverage, so the preventative care effort will remove one more barrier for people hoping to get off social assistance, Matthews added.</p>
<p>Care will be provided by dentists at health units, community health centres and some dentists in private practice, with successful applicants getting an eligibility card.</p>
<p>The long-awaited program, which works out to an average of $346 per child, is part of the government's anti-poverty efforts but was delayed for several months because the health units needed "all hands on deck" last year to cope with the massive H1N1 flu vaccination effort, the minister said.</p>
<p>Healthy smiles builds on the existing "children in need of treatment" program that provides emergency dental care only - and has prompted potshots from the Ontario Dental Association and others.</p>
<p>Critics maintained it defied logic that the province would pay to fix painful cavities long overdue for treatment but not provide the care that would prevent them in the first place.</p>
<p>"No child in Ontario should have to suffer from dental pain, have problems with eating, communicating or attending school," said dental association president Dr. Lynn Tomkins.</p>
<p>Despite the new program, the government has not kept its 2007 election promise to provide free dental care for adults who are among the working poor.</p>
<p>Officials said the $135 million budgeted in 2008 for such a program over three years is being poured into dental care for children because the recession has left the government in a cash crunch.</p>
<p>"We're focusing on kids," said Children and Youth Services Minister Laurel Broten. "Prevention and early treatment will save us money in the future."</p>
<p>The American Dental Association estimates that every dollar spent on preventative oral care saves as much as $50 on later treatment, and alleviates other health and self-esteem problems in children.</p>
<p>Opposition parties have been critical of the government for not fulfilling its promise of doing more to help adults who can't afford dental care, which, as another Star investigation found earlier this year, results in some people going to non-accredited "dentists" at cut rates and at risk to their health.</p>
<p>"I expect that when you put forward an election plan you know how you're going to pay for it and how to carry out those promises," said Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak.</p>
<p>His NDP counterpart, Andrea Horwath, said she expects the Liberals will "continue to stall" on dental care for working poor adults.</p>
<p>Matthews said she doesn't know if that promise will be repeated in the Liberal platform for the provincial election on Oct. 6 of next year.</p>
<p>Parents gauging their eligibility for the healthy smiles program should know the adjusted family net income is family net income, calculated from line 236 of each spouse's or partner's tax return, and excluding any amounts received from the Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) and the Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP), the health ministry said.</p>
<p>The information is also available on the annual goods and services tax credit entitlement notice and the annual Canada Child Tax Benefit and Ontario Child Benefit notice. Applicants for the program will be asked to present those documents when submitting the forms.</p>
<p>One-third of Canadians do not have dental insurance, according to Health Canada.</p>

<p>OTTAWA F The chief public health officer says last year's H1N1 pandemic could have been as deadly as the Spanish Flu had it not been for government spade work. Dr. David Butler-Jones says the outbreak "could have been much worse." He credits years of preparatory work by the federal and provincial governments for making one of the country's largest mass immunizations run relatively smoothly. The virus killed more than 400 Canadians and made many more sick. By contrast, the Spanish flu pandemic that started in 1918 was possibly the deadliest outbreak of all time, killing an estimated 50 million people worldwide.</p>

<p>Manitoba Finance Minister Rosann Wowchuk credits her government's frugality for pulling the province back from the $555-million deficit expected for 2009. Manitoba went into the hole by "only" $201 million, public accounts show.</p>
<p>But those numbers relate to the summary budget, which includes the net incomes and losses of Crown corporations, only two of which dump cash into the treasury.</p>
<p>What Ms. Wowchuk did not dwell upon, what Manitobans should consider, is how the government's own finances -- the "core" government operations -- worked out. Do that and once again it becomes clear the NDP administration's habit of overspending dug the deficit hole far deeper than necessary. The accounts of core government operations -- department spending balanced against the money flowing in from taxation, fees, federal transfers and from the liquor and the lotteries agencies -- show that the government rang up a $501-million deficit last year.</p>
<p>In fact, had the government simply stuck to the spending plan laid out in its 2009 budget, the deficit on core operations would have been $165 million. Not great, but not a half-billion in the hole, either. And only $77 million off budget. And that could have been achieved at a time when global economies were reeling, when the American subprime elephant rolled over and squashed Canada's remarkable decade of growth.</p>
<p>Instead, as panic grew, the government announced it had to roll with the hard times. Manitoba's balanced-budget legislation was offered up on the altar of economic recovery. The government amended it to allow the accounts to be balanced over five years, rather than four.</p>
<p>To be fair, 2009 saw the pandemic flu suck an unpredictable $83 million out of the treasury, accounting largely for why the Health department overshot its budget ($4.7 billion) by $100 million. But even H1N1, and the $173 million of total "emergency" spending, only account for half of the over-spending.</p>
<p>This is not frugal management by any stretch of accounting imagination. Ms. Wowchuk can spin that tale only by reminding Manitobans how panicked was the government as revenue estimates were revised for the economic hit. In fact, revenues fell just $68 million short of the budget's target.</p>
<p>Amid the wizardry, the provincial government has hiked borrowing, allowing the debt to balloon (it also changed balanced-budget legislation last year to remove a requirement of minimum debt payments). This has hiked the debt per capita and as a percentage of GDP.</p>
<p>Spending rises apace. In March, Ms. Wowchuk committed to keeping spending increases at two per cent in each of the next four years. That sounds like restraint, but Manitobans should remember this: This is the government, the minister, who vowed to get tough with publicly paid workers this year, to freeze wages for two years -- in lieu of layoffs, she warned. But then taxpayers learned that wasn't exactly what the government had in mind. In fact, it had hived away millions of dollars in contingency for negotiations that eventually awarded signing bonuses in place of annual increases.</p>
<p>The experience of 2009 shows what could have been accomplished by a government that exercised restraint. There is no record of frugality, Ms. Wowchuk, only squandered opportunity.</p>

<p>Common fertilization method can favour boys, study finds</p>
<p>A widely used form of assisted fertilization appears to result in more male than female babies being born, a large study in Australia and New Zealand has found. All fertility clinics that took part in the study comply with guidelines that ban gender selection, the researchers wrote in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Among women who were given standard IVF, 53 per cent had male babies. In standard IVF, sperm and egg are incubated together in a culture. More boys seemed to result from embryos that were transferred to the womb four days after fertilization (54.1 per cent) compared to 2-3 days after fertilization (49.9 per cent), the study found.</p>

<p>The head of a World Health Organization probe into the international handling of the swine flu pandemic said Wednesday that multiple definitions of pandemic caused "confusion" and muddled the response.</p>

Fineberg said after the third round of hearings by the panel in Geneva that it would consider recommendations seeking "at the minimum" clarity and consistency on the issue.</p>

</p>
<p>BETHESDA, MD. -- Swine flu no longer represents a major threat in the U.S. because so many people are immune to the virus that caused last season's pandemic, health officials reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>Of the 310 million people in the U.S., 59 per cent are believed to be immune to pandemic H1N1 flu, researchers say. Approximately 62 million people were vaccinated against the virus, 61 million people were infected by it, and another 60 million people 57 or older carry protective antibodies to similar viruses that circulated years ago.</p>
<p>"It's very unlikely that the virus will explode in the fall," says Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., an author of the analysis. "We now have evidence of that."</p>
<p>The evidence comes from a flurry of studies of the 2009-10 pandemic carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the researchers say. If this virus follows the pattern set by earlier flu bugs, it will die out completely or circulate among people who are still susceptible a year-and-a-half after the virus emerged, the authors report in the journal mBio.</p>
<p>There are still many people who are vulnerable to swine flu, says David Morens, a virologist and historian at The National Institute, who cowrote the report with Fauci and colleague Jeffery Taubenberger.</p>
<p>"Even with the majority of people in the U.S. immune to the virus, that leaves many tens of millions of people still susceptible," Morens says. "We know the age groups that are most susceptible - people younger than 55 and those with chronic conditions."</p>
<p>The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control now estimates the 2009 H1N1 flu killed roughly 12,500 and sent 274,000 people to the hospital with respiratory diseases and other complications, a toll that mirrors the latest averages for people who suffer from seasonal flu. The death rate was relatively low compared with other pandemics, especially the 1918 flu, which killed 675,000 people in the U.S., Morens says.</p>
<p>So far, he says, the virus hasn't developed "some terrible new mutation" that would make it more lethal, though that could still occur.</p>
<p>For the first time, federal health officials recommend that all people older than six months get vaccinated against flu, unless they have an allergy to eggs.</p>
<p>Five manufacturers are churning out 150 million doses.</p>
<p>The U.S. says most of its citizens are immune to H1N1.

<p>Canadians, according to a recent study commissioned by ABC Literacy for Life and conducted by Ipsos Reid, value literacy highly: 90 per cent of respondents linked improved literacy skills to an improved economy, and 93 per cent agreed all levels of government should support improving Canadians' literacy levels. And those levels require improvement to a greater degree than many realize.</p>
<p>Fully 42 per cent of Canadians do not have the literacy skills they need to be successful in everyday activities such as reading a newspaper or filling out job applications, according to the International Adult Literacy and Skills Survey.</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean they're illiterate. It means they don't have the literacy required to be fully productive and socially involved in a knowledge-based economy," says Paul Cappon, president and CEO of the Canadian Council on Learning in Ottawa.</p>
<p>"We have a reasonably strong primary, secondary and post-secondary education system but we are weak in learning in the workplace, in early childhood and in the community and that has huge implications for the health of communities. There is a direct relationship between lack of literacy and poverty, crime and poor health." Sherry Campbell, president and CEO of Frontier College in Toronto, which brings literacy programs to some of the country's most vulnerable groups -- youth, aboriginal communities, low-income families, prisons and new immigrants -- says reading and writing are "foundational skills."</p>
<p>"It's hard to develop a poverty strategy if you don't include literacy," Campbell says.</p>
<p>"People can't get jobs if they can't read or write and they can't increase their earnings if they can't get a job. If you can't read, how do you make health decisions for your family? Do you get the H1N1 vaccine or not? If kids aren't reading and writing very well, it's difficult for them to get jobs. If kids can't get jobs, there's a greater chance they may engage in criminal activity. How do we change that? How do we make it easier for them to become employable? We need to get them to a place where they feel they can learn."</p>
<p>"There are children who go to school in this country who have never been read to in their home," says Janet Lane, executive director, Literacy Alberta and chairwoman of the Movement for Canadian Literacy.</p>
<p>"Helping a parent become more literate and more interested in reading at home will help to break that cycle. That's why family literacy programming in communities is so important. As we become more literate, we are better problem solvers and decision makers. We contribute more in our families, in the workplace, in the community. Everything improves with a more literate society."</p>

<p>The Canadian government is looking for a back-up supplier for a pandemic flu vaccine, in the event another deadly virus rears its head, which shows that Canada has acknowledged its mistake, and learned from it.</p>
<p>This country simply did not have enough H1N1 vaccine ready for enough people when the pandemic was at its height last fall. Several provinces shunted schoolchildren to the back of the line, which made little sense morally or strategically. The vaccine was not ready before the pandemic peaked, and since the vaccine, once injected, required up to two weeks to take effect, it was, in effect, late. When people wanted it, it was not available; when it was available, people didn't want it.</p>
<p>Not all of that could be laid at the feet of the supplier, GlaxoSmithKline Inc., which has a plant in Sainte-Foy, Que., or blamed on the government's sole-supplier policy. There was a passel of problems, including poor commun-</p>
<p>ication between the Public Health Agency of Canada and the provinces about the availability of the vaccine supply, and poor understanding within public-health departments of the public's ever-evolving perception of the dangers of H1N1.</p>
<p>But there were also early glitches and longer-lasting bottlenecks at <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, as Paul Lucas, its president and CEO, acknowledges. Even Mr. Lucas says, “It's always good to have a back-up plan.” Canada didn't appear to have one.</p>
<p>The sole-supplier strategy was a reaction to the 1976 swine-flu fiasco, when Canada ordered vaccine from the United States, and it didn't arrive. The idea to produce enough supply for all Canadians within this country's borders is a good one, but security of supply is not, as the late football coach Vince Lombardi might have put it, the only thing; timeliness counts, too.</p>
<p>The pandemic, though it killed 18,000 worldwide and 428 in Canada, never lived up to its fearful billing. Even today, some argue that the fears were overblown, and the vaccine a waste of public money. It isn't true, though; an independent study found the vaccination program in Ontario, which reached only 33 per cent of the population, still managed to save 50 lives and prevent nearly a million cases of H1N1, thus averting 420 hospital admissions, 28,000 emergency-department visits and 100,000 visits to doctors' offices.</p>
<p>Vaccine supply is not the place to be putting all of a country's eggs in one basket, as it were. Canada may find some new mistakes to make, but at least it will not repeat the ones it made.</p>

<p>Prairieland Park will be the site of a large immunization clinic again this year as Saskatoon residents are encouraged to get the seasonal flu shot.</p>
<p>The immunization will be free for everyone and will include protection against last year's H1N1 pandemic virus, which officials expect will be circulating in the community again. Clinics open Oct. 12.</p>
<p>"Even if you were immunized last year, protection decreases over time," said Ross Findlater, deputy medical health officer for the Saskatoon Health Region. "The seasonal vaccine will act like a booster for the H1N1 strain and protect from two other types as well."</p>
<p>The region said vaccination is especially important for people at high risk of flu complications, including adults 65 and older, children between six months and four years, pregnant women, residents of long-term care facilities and people in close contact with those who are at high risk.</p>
<p>In addition to the clinic at Prairieland Park, there will also be smaller clinics at about 70 other locations throughout the region.</p>
<p>Clinic times and locations are available at www.4flu.ca[http://www.4flu.ca] or by calling 655-4flu (4358).</p>
<p>Officials are also encouraging residents to guard against the seasonal flu through frequent hand washing and staying at home when sick.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ottawa seeks backup source of pandemic vaccine; Criticism during the H1N1 crisis has prompted a two-pronged approach going forward, for both pandemic and seasonal flu vaccines</b>
</div><div>Steve Rennie  </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA --</p>
<p>The federal government wants some backup in case its main supplier of pandemic flu vaccine can't deliver.</p>
<p>The move may be a partial answer to criticism that surfaced during an uneasy period of the H1N1 crisis when it appeared Canada wasn't getting vaccine quickly enough to meet the demand. There were criticisms of the government for having only one supplier of vaccine.</p>
<p>Now, the federal government is looking for a 10-year contract with a domestic supplier to make pandemic vaccine and a portion of the seasonal flu vaccine that's needed.</p>
<p>As well, it has requested proposals from other pharmaceutical companies for a three-year contract to provide seasonal flu vaccine with the option of also being a backup supplier of vaccine for a pandemic, should it be required.</p>
<p>If two such contracts are awarded, it would be a change from Canada's long-standing practice of having only one supplier of pandemic vaccine.</p>
<p>“I think it's a good decision. I think it's a sound decision,” said Dr. Perry Kendall, chief medical officer of health for British Columbia.</p>
<p>“It'll give us an added level of security.”</p>
<p>Canada was the first country to sign a pandemic flu vaccine contract, back in 2001. That deal with GlaxoSmithKline ends next spring and the government wants to sign another 10-year deal.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department posted the two contract notices last month, and the deadline to apply passed a few weeks ago. The value of the deals isn't listed on the two contract notices.</p>
<p>One condition for the long-term contract is that it must go to a manufacturer located in Canada.</p>
<p>The government has made having a domestic supplier of vaccine a part of its pandemic planning since the United States refused to allow the export of vaccine destined for Canada during the 1976 swine flu scare.</p>
<p>Those who know the file say domestic supplier is code for GlaxoSmithKline, the only company that meets Ottawa's criteria. The company's plant at Ste-Foy, Que., is the only flu vaccine production facility in Canada.</p>
<p>Whoever gets the pandemic vaccine contract will also have to make at least five million doses of the seasonal flu shot that people get each year, according to the contract notice.</p>
<p>The government is also planning to award a three-year contract to a second company to make roughly the same amount of the seasonal flu shot. Part of the shorter deal also includes “an option for a backup pandemic vaccine supply if acceptable and viable for Canada,” says the contract notice.</p>
<p>“If it is determined that a backup pandemic supply arrangement is feasible, establishing a readiness contract in advance would enhance Canada's ability to get vaccine from offshore in the event that delays are experienced by the primary supplier,” the Public Health Agency of Canada said in an e-mail.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency added that having a second supplier of pandemic vaccine could allow access to an “alternate vaccine formulation” if it's required for higher-risk groups such as health-care workers, young children, pregnant women and people with chronic conditions – if the alternate formulation isn't available from the domestic supplier.</p>
<p>Sanofi Pasteur spokeswoman Nancy Simpson confirmed the company has bid on the contract to make a backup supply of pandemic vaccine. But she says the company hasn't been told when the federal government will award the contract.</p>
<p>It's unclear how many other companies might have bid on the contract.</p>
<p>There were an uneasy few weeks during the height of the H1N1 scare – amid uncertainty about how bad the pandemic would be – when it appeared Canada might not get vaccine quickly enough.</p>
<p>The government was hammered in Parliament and in the editorial pages for not having contracts with multiple suppliers.</p>
<p>“The concern was, it would be a sensible move in the future to look at having a contingency, backup supplier,” Dr. Kendall said.</p>
<p>“We were criticized for only having one domestic supplier, even though that supplier came through in the end. So the thought was, if we can have a backup supplier, then we have an extra measure of security.”</p>
<p>But, in the end, Canada got more vaccine sooner than probably any other country and it immunized more of its population than any other nation that attempted vaccination against H1N1.</p>
<p>GlaxoSmithKline says it's proud of how it handled the H1N1 outbreak, and it welcomes having a backup supplier.</p>
<p>“We supplied more pandemic vaccine than any other manufacturer in the world, and provided it on a better timescale,” the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>“However, as a patient-focused company, GSK recognizes that it always a good idea to have a backup plan, especially in circumstances as integral to public health as pandemic immunization programs and contracts.”</p>
<p>The U.S. had five suppliers, and that didn't assure Americans speedy access to sufficient quantities of vaccine, many observers have since noted.</p>

<p>Erica Diamond used to sell gifts emblazoned with corporate logos. Now, she's her own brand.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old mother of two has found a new niche as a writer, with a personal blog ( www.WomenOnTheFence.com)that[http://www.WomenOnTheFence.com)that] gets 100,000 page views a month, and a book, The 99 Things Women Wish They Knew Before . . . Starting Their Own Business.</p>
<p>"Every woman should wake up and have a purpose, something to call her own, separate from her husband, boyfriend and children. This is mine. I'm on a mission to inspire women to stop just existing and start living," she said in an interview at the Montreal home she shares with husband, Hilly, and sons Andrew, 7, and Sean, 3.</p>
<p>Diamond started her blog a year ago on a free platform after meeting a woman at lunch who kept an online journal.</p>
<p>"It's not that I thought my life was that interesting," she said, "but I liked the concept of connecting women in the same situation, on the fence in their marriages, or their jobs, or with their children."</p>
<p>The blog also was an outlet for the ideas after a four-year absence from the workforce to take care of her kids.</p>
<p>"The entrepreneurship urges were calling again," said Diamond, a McGill University psychology graduate who started her first business, Unique Corporate Gifts, when she was 24 and sold it seven years later to Bentley, the national bag and luggage chain.</p>
<p>"I was burned out, totally at a crossroads," she said. "All I wanted to do was get up and wear my pyjamas all day."</p>
<p>With time to reflect, she turned to writing. She authored three children's books for her kids alone, then began sharing her thoughts on the complexities of women's lives.</p>
<p>Her blog came to the attention of <span class="companylink">Glam Media</span>, which approached her about syndicating it. It's now a link on seven major sites geared to women. She's paid by <span class="companylink">Glam Media</span>, which sells the advertising.</p>
<p>It's not a huge money-maker, but has helped generate spinoff income such as speaking engagements and the book deal, Diamond said.</p>
<p>The book is the product of a chance encounter in the emergency room at the Jewish General Hospital last fall.</p>
<p>Diamond was there with her husband, who she thought might have the H1N1 virus. Also there was Helen Georgaklis, who'd brought her daughter with similar symptoms. (Neither, it turns out, had the flu.)</p>
<p>The two women got to talking and sharing information. Georgaklis, founder of the 99 Series of self-help books, checked out Diamond's blog and got back to her quickly with an offer.</p>
<p>"She said they were looking for someone to write a book about women in business for their 99 Things series, and asked if I'd be interested."</p>
<p>Diamond started Unique Corporate Gifts in 1999 with $5,000, a website and a plan. She has strong opinions on what helped and hindered her.</p>
<p>"I wrote (the book) the way I write the blog -- no mumbo-jumbo, nothing over the heads of readers. It gets right to the nitty-gritty, stuff that worked for me."</p>
<p>For starters, making the extra effort for customers. That always pays off, she said.</p>
<p>"One time, I went to the airport and practically begged customs to release a package of custom-made cardholders. They'd flagged it as suspicious and said on the phone it couldn't be accessed for at least 24 hours. It was for an event that night.</p>
<p>"I said, 'It's for my biggest client, I'll lose them if I don't get this.' I wouldn't take no for an answer and they finally opened it, checked that it was OK and gave it to me."</p>
<p>One of the common failings in small business is proper pricing, she said. "People shortchange themselves. They underestimate the real cost of providing a service or product. They get to the end of the year, look at the numbers and wonder where the profits are."</p>
<p>Small or difficult accounts usually aren't worth the bother and better abandoned, she said. "You can't simply take every single order."</p>
<p>Corporate culture, on the other hand, always is worth the investment.</p>
<p>"I took my employees bowling, for drinks. One lunch hour, I brought in a masseur. I did everything I could to make them feel appreciated. They'll be more productive than someone disgruntled."</p>
<p>Diamond says she doesn't believe women can have it all. Something will always be amiss.</p>
<p>"You can't give 80 hours a week at work and 100 per cent to your kids. You may be happy at work but struggling financially. You may have money but a dysfunctional marriage or an ailing parent. No perfect thing exists in this world."</p>
<p>The achievable target, she said, is balance and a sense of fulfilment.</p>
<p>"We all have ups and downs. We're all a work in progress. Being content from within, that's having it all."</p>

</p>
<p>Dr. Evil and his mangy cat, Mr. Bigglesworth, must be sick with envy as they watch that upstart Eddie Francis, the new prince of darkness, pursue his monstrous plan for global domination.</p>
<p>Today Windsor. Tomorrow the world. With just over four weeks left until the civic election, the space between feet-on-the-ground reality and the delusions of the increasingly frantic band of Eddie-hating space cadets is collapsing into a black hole that swallows the last traces of common sense.</p>
<p>In this comic-strip world, where all is black and white and the conspiracies are ever-so-easy to track, Francis has spent the last seven years orchestrating his hometown's economic misery and setting in motion plans to bring the world to its knees.</p>
<p>It's all Eddie's fault. When in doubt, just blame Eddie. Pile it on. Load him up. The Great Recession? The Wall Street meltdown? The U.S. housing industry collapse? The near-death travails of GM and Chrysler? Yup. All Eddie's fault. And the job losses here in Canada's former automotive capital? Oh yeah. Eddie's fault as well.</p>
<p>A convenient fall guy? Oh no. It's way more than that. These folks harbour an almost touching belief in our current mayor's capacity to influence world events. Never mind that he's one of 11 elected individuals directing the civic affairs of a modest Canadian border city that's a long way from the centre of the universe. They vest in him remarkable powers for evil-doing, apparently secured through some backroom Faustian bargain.</p>
<p>The U.S. decision to harden the border and require passports, which all but killed cross-border tourism and knee-capped our casino industry? Yep. Eddie was whispering in George Bush's ear when that call was made. The rise of the Canadian dollar from 62 cents to near-parity which devastated our manufacturing exports? That was Evil Eddie toying with the international currency system.</p>
<p>And all those millions of sub-prime loans that went bad in the U.S. when people woke up and realized folks without incomes shouldn't have been buying McMansions in order to live the American Dream? Yeah. That was heartless Eddie's doing. He punctured real estate balloons in Las Vegas and Fort Myers and turned entire subdivisions into ghost towns.</p>
<p>And the fiscal collapse, product of obscene corporate greed, that froze lending, snuffed out scores of banks and triggered world-wide fears of another Great Depression? Yes indeed. That was Eddie playing fast and loose with U.S. financial regulations.</p>
<p>And the car industry? Surely it's obvious. Eddie was in the design studios, looking over creative shoulders, when the car makers were drawing up plans for vehicles nobody wanted to buy.</p>
<p>He was there in the boardrooms, egging them on, when GM and Chrysler made dumb decisions that nearly killed both companies.</p>
<p>Why stop there? Blame Eddie for the tragic mess over in Michigan where 634,000 people were jobless in August and the state unemployment rate, at 13.1 per cent, is significantly worse than Windsor's.</p>
<p>Go for broke. Blame Eddie for SARS and Swine Flu. Blame him for the volcanic eruption in Iceland. Blame him for the Leamington tornado. Blame him for the debt crisis in Greece and for the transformation of Ireland from Celtic Tiger to toothless tabby. No doubt he's responsible for Spain's 20 per cent unemployment rate. And let's blame him, in advance, for the armies of blood-sucking, madness-inducing bedbugs now marching on Windsor from Manhattan.</p>
<p>There's no room for reality when you're building conspiracy theories. No room to acknowledge the miracle that Windsor built a first-class arena complex after four decades of council dithering. No room to say thanks for the poker playing that turned a misguided $300-million border "fix" into a realistic $1.8-billion parkway plan. Six times the original funding commitment. And counting. And not a word of thanks from organizations that will profit immensely from the city's hard-nosed bargaining.</p>
<p>Dr. Evil? Mr. Fixit is more like it. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when I heard Rick Limoges question whether Francis is the right guy to get a transient marina built.</p>
<p>Has Limoges forgotten that he was on council back in the dark ages, from 1985 to 1999? Has he erased from memory his part in the conceiving of two honking great white elephants, the Cleary reconstruction and the Norwich Block redevelopment?</p>
<p>Who cleaned up those inherited debacles? It sure in heck wasn't Limoges. He was long gone, punted off Parliament Hill by disenchanted Windsor voters, when Francis was called in with mop and pail.</p>

</p>
<p>Tyler Bozak and Phil Kessel have become fast friends, thanks to a summer where the two "hung out" a lot and had "a lot of fun."</p>
<p>Now, their friendship has taken on a new character - literally.</p>
<p>"Yeah, they're inseparable, we've started calling them Bert and Ernie," Leaf defenceman Mike Komisarek said, referring to the famous Sesame Street characters.</p>
<p>Kessel said the friendship certainly helps the two on the ice, where they are expected to lead the Leafs offensively this season.</p>
<p>"Anytime you have fun together, it can carry over to the ice ... it makes it easier to play the game," Kessel said.</p>
<p>HIGH HOPES: Leafs coach Ron Wilson also noticed the friendship between his top goal scorer (Kessel) and No. 1 centre (Bozak).</p>
<p>While not given to making predictions for his players, Wilson hopes for bigger things from the pair this season.</p>
<p>"Tyler is strong, better prepared for the battle," Wilson said. "If Phil scores 40 goals (he had 30 in 70 games last season), then Tyler should be in on a lot of them. So I'd say 50 or 60 points would be a good season for Tyler and I'm sure he can build on that."</p>
<p>BOZAK BEEFS UP: Bozak said he is fully recovered weight-wise from the devastating illness he suffered at the outset of last season.</p>
<p>Bozak was severely weakened by the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>"I got back to 175 pounds by the end of the season, now I'm at 195 ... where I should be," Bozak said.</p>
<p>SCHENN LOOKING GOOD: Wilson also sees good things for Luke Schenn, who has also come into camp with more muscle.</p>
<p>"Maybe last year was a bit of a setback ... but he's here this year much more focused," Wilson said.</p>
<p>"He's re-sculptured his body, he's up to 225 pounds now, and the experience he's had the past two seasons should help."</p>
<p>Healthy again, Tyler Bozak is the Leafs' No. 1 centre.   </p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu vaccine free to all Manitobans - Will protect against H1N1 virus</b>
</div><div>By Bruce Owen   </div>

</p>
<p>What a difference a year makes.</p>
<p>Last year Manitoba and the rest of the country were battening down the hatches in an all-out attack against the advancing H1NI influenza virus.</p>
<p>This year the province only issued a simple press release that the annual flu shot program starts next month.</p>
<p>What's new is that the flu vaccine is free to all Manitobans. It will protect against the most common strains of influenza as determined by the World Health Organization, including the H1N1 strain.</p>
<p>Health Minister Theresa Oswald said the province is offering the free shot so that Manitobans from all walks of life -- not just those at high risk of getting seriously ill -- get immunized.</p>
<p>"In years past there has been target groups," she said. "If you were outside of that target group you needed to pay for the shot. That won't be the case this year."</p>
<p>The purpose of offering a free universal shot is to increase the number of people who get immunized, she said.</p>
<p>Oswald also said despite the H1N1 pandemic being long over, the H1N1 virus is still circulating and that Manitobans should protect themselves from it and other flu viruses.</p>
<p>"It might not be causing a huge problem in the system like a pandemic would, but it might be really uncomfortable to you," she said.</p>
<p>Oswald said flu shots will be offered at places where people get medical care, such as public-health clinics and doctor's officed. More information on specific clinic dates and locations is available from local public health offices.</p>
<p>"The mass clinics last year were necessary because of the supply-chain problems that we had, but they didn't necessarily improve uptake," she said.</p>
<p>Last year saw a frenzy of activity from provincial and federal health officials to prepare people for what was feared to be the onslaught of H1N1, a new flu virus that attacked young people more than other strains of flu.</p>
<p>About 448,000 Manitobans -- representing approximately 37 per cent of the province's population -- received shots.</p>

<p>Oswald said one thing Manitobans did learn from last year's flu scare is that they're smarter about not spreading the virus.</p>
<p>"If you look at how people behave now about coughing and even about handwashing, as annoying as it seemed last year, people have changed as a result of the mass national and international campaign," she said.</p>

</p>
<p>The Conservatives are defending their record advertising spending last year by saying the number compares favourably to the Liberal budget in the days of the sponsorship scandal.</p>
<p>Fending off opposition allegations of partisan self-promotion and waste, the Harper government said Tuesday the increase in advertising spending was largely related to the $24-million campaign promoting the H1N1 vaccination program.</p>
<p>Treasury Board President Stockwell Day said if that element was removed from Ottawa’s 2009-2010 advertising budget of $130-million, the final number actually would have come in lower than the amount that was spent by the Liberals in 2002-2003.</p>
<p>“If you go back even eight years to 2002, the Liberal spending on the same account was $110-million. If you take the $25-million that we spent warning Canadians about H1N1, actually it turns out that we spent less than the Liberals did eight years ago,” Mr. Day said in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters after Question Period, Mr. Day did not directly answer a question as to whether advertising spending would go down next year back into the $80-million range, which had been the average budget in recent years.</p>
<p>He also did not address the fact the Conservatives, when they were in opposition, sharply criticized the Chrétien government for its advertising budgets and the lucrative contracts that went to Liberal-friendly advertising firms.</p>
<p>During Question Period, the Liberal Party and the NDP accused the government of engaging in wasteful self-promotion activities by increasing their advertising budget by 64-per cent in 2009-2010, compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>In particular, the opposition parties pointed out that the Conservative advertising blitz was mainly related to the $50-million price tag for the promotion of the Economic Action Plan. Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said the spending showed that the Conservative government is out of touch with Canadians.</p>
<p>“It is not just a waste of money, it is a question of priorities,” Mr. Ignatieff said. “The government’s priorities are prisons, planes and publicity. The priorities of Canadians are education, health care and retirement security.”</p>
<p>NDP Leader Jack Layton added: “After two years of zero increases for the senior citizens in this country who needed the help while inflation was on the go, [the government] can come up with millions for self-promotion.”</p>
<p>The opposition parties were reacting to a report in Tuesday’s Globe and Mail that revealed the record spending on advertising (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/conservatives-spent-record-130-million-on-advertising-as-deficit-soared/article1715738/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/conservatives-spent-record-130-million-on-advertising-as-deficit-soared/article1715738/]) last year.</p>

</div><div>Ken Peters The Hamilton Spectator  </div>

</p>
<p>Hamilton and Halton public health experts are holding their breaths, hoping the region will face a much weaker flu attack this fall than the powerhouse H1N1 that wreaked havoc at schools and workplaces last autumn.</p>
<p>You remember H1N1, don't you? Hamilton classrooms less than one-quarter full, workplace absence policies, handwashing reminders everywhere, hospital masks worn on the street, vaccine shortages and flu shot lineups. Those images from the fall of 2009 are hard to forget.</p>
<p>But both Dr. Elizabeth Richardson and Dr. Bob Nosal, medical officers of health for Hamilton and Halton, respectively, said the indications from southern hemisphere countries such as New Zealand and Chile, which have already experienced their winter flu seasons, suggest the Golden Horseshoe is in for a milder season.</p>
<p>That should translate into fewer cases of flu and symptoms nowhere near as severe as witnessed last fall.</p>
<p>Flu vaccines this season will cover the H1N1 and two other flu strains, a B-strain and an H3 strain.</p>
<p>The fact that more than half of the population in this area was immunized for H1N1 last year, or experienced some form of it, suggests that strain will have much less impact this season.</p>
<p>"I think I can say with a good degree of confidence it will be nothing like last year," Nosal said. "So what we saw last year will not be occurring this year.</p>
<p>"That's because it was the new pandemic strain that was circulating."</p>
<p>Nosal predicts H1N1 will still be the most prevalent flu strain this year, but it will arrive without the fury it had in 2009.</p>
<p>He said those who received the H1N1 vaccine last year should be protected from at least that strain.</p>
<p>Nosal still recommends most area residents consider getting a flu shot this season, because an H3 strain has already shown up in a school in York Region.</p>
<p>"We expect to see flu this year," he said. "As to whether we'll see more H3 or H1 or a B-strain, no one knows for sure, but earlier in the year, the feeling is it could be H1."</p>
<p>Richardson agreed that H1N1 will be nowhere near the media star it was in 2009.</p>
<p>"The virus can always do things at the last moment that we're not anticipating ... but based on what we see elsewhere we don't see (a repeat of 2009) happening," she said.</p>
<p>Richardson said Ontario public health officials are expected to roll out their 2010 flu strategy over the next few days.</p>
<p>Both Halton and Hamilton public health will be rolling out their schedules for flu clinics shortly. The flu vaccine will also be available from family physicians.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Harper government spent a record $130-million on advertising last year</b>
</div><div>DANIEL LEBLANC   </div>
<div>605 words</div><div>21 September 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Ottawa's advertising budget ballooned to a record $130-million last year, according to previously unreleased figures that show a 64-per-cent increase in the government's marketing bill in a time of unprecedented deficits.</p>
<p>The advertising budget for 2009-2010 is a large increase of $50.5-million over the previous year's budget of $79.5-million. In addition, the latest tally is more than three times higher than the advertising budget of $41.3-million in 2005-2006, when the Harper government took office.</p>
<p>By far, the most expensive element in last year's advertising blitz was the $49.5-million that was spent on the promotion of the Economic Action Plan, which consisted of measures that were announced in recent recession-fighting budgets. The government racked up a $54-billion deficit last year, and is arguing that it needed to promote various measures that were put in place to create jobs and promote growth in Canada.</p>
<p>“Advertising costs for the Economic Action Plan were one-time only costs in the context of the global economic crisis, during which the [government of Canada] deemed it important to communicate with Canadians about the programs and services available to them to counter tough economic times,” the Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada said in a statement.</p>
<p>Up until now, the Conservatives had spent much less on advertising than their Liberal predecessors. In 2002-2003, for example, the Liberals allocated $111-million to advertising, which is much higher than the average of $83.5-million a year that the Conservatives spent on advertising between 2006 and 2008.</p>
<p>The overall spending on advertising dropped dramatically between 2003 and 2005, as former prime ministers Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin faced a political crisis over the sponsorship scandal and cut budgets below $50-million.</p>
<p>Given it accumulated a record deficit in 2009-2010, the government can expect to face opposition attacks over its decision to increase spending on advertising to $130-million. Even before the new numbers were released, the government was frequently accused of using taxpayers' dollars for political purposes by widely promoting its measures to fight the global slowdown.</p>
<p>On Monday, for example, the government came under fire in the House of Commons for insisting that banners be placed at all sites that received funding from the Economic Action Plan across Canada.</p>
<p>“When will the government create a mechanism to ensure that advertising serves the interests of Canadians instead of those of the Conservative Party,” Liberal MP John McCallum asked in the House.</p>
<p>Transport Minister Chuck Strahl said the government was being transparent.</p>
<p>The size of the 2009-2010 advertising budget will come as a surprise to many, given that the Treasury Board Secretariat has compiled a list on its website of the advertising budgets of various departments for the year, totalling $85.3-million.</p>
<p>According to Treasury Board, the government has approved $65.4-million in advertising spending in the ongoing fiscal year of 2010-2011.</p>
<p>In addition to spending on the Economic Action Plan, federal officials said last year's spike in advertising was mainly related to the mass vaccination campaign against the H1N1 virus, which came in at $24.1-million.</p>
<p>“In the context of a global H1N1 pandemic, a significant amount of advertising costs can be attributed to the efforts of the [government of Canada], in partnership with the provinces and territories, to encourage Canadians to protect themselves against the virus,” the Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>BED BUG FEVER; Reports of the bloodsuckers are up – and so is the paranoia</b>
</div><div>DAKSHANA BASCARAMURTY   </div>

<p>When Ottawan Lisa Vod travelled to Toronto this past weekend, she brought the grubbiest contents of her wardrobe to the hotel: a ripped hoodie, an old sweatshirt and worn-out sweatpants. Before she left, Ms. Vod, a 34-year-old factory worker, knew she'd trash those clothes before she went home. She kept her nice outfits in the car to change into right before she went out on the town.</p>
<p>They may seem like extreme measures, but Ms. Vod has been bitten by the bed-bug hysteria infesting major Canadian cities in recent months.</p>
<p>Last year, Toronto Public Health received 1,500 reports of bed bugs. As of the end of August, they'd already racked up 1,334 reports for 2010, including 258 that month alone.</p>
<p>Rising even faster than the reports is bloodsucker paranoia. Victims trade stories about the lasting psychological effects on online bed-bug forums, those in charitable organizations business have become leery of donations, and people who have had infestations keep mum among friends and colleagues out of fear they'll be stigmatized.</p>
<p>Exterminators and entomologists have floated various theories of why bed bugs – whose numbers had declined in the past few decades only to tick upward recently – are back.</p>
<p>Susan Sperling, a spokeswoman for Toronto Public Health, says their increase could be due to the fact that people are travelling more and taking the critters with them in their suitcases from one city to another. Another reason could be the ban of broad-spectrum residual pesticides – which were found to have other serious negative health effects. A built-up resistance to chemicals could also be to blame, she says.</p>
<p>Ms. Vod researched hotels on TripAdvisor before finding one she hoped was bed-bug free.</p>
<p>“I will inspect the room … to make sure,” Ms. Vod wrote in an e-mail before she left for Toronto. “Now because it seems to be all over the news, I'm overstressed.”</p>
<p>Adam Radomsky, an associate psychology professor at Montreal's Concordia University who is completing a three-year body of work on contamination fears, likens bed-bug disgust and discomfort to what happened with SARS and H1N1.</p>
<p>“Things were very narrow in the beginning for those problems. The anxiety, the fear, the panic spread much further and I think it's the same phenomenon happening here.”</p>
<p>Fear can take shape even when there isn't clear evidence of contamination, he says.</p>
<p>“We can feel contaminated thinking about something, remembering something.”</p>
<p>Another problem with bed bugs, says Andrew Keddie, an insect pathologist at the University of Alberta, is that “as a rule, you don't find them.”</p>
<p>Their shape – they're small, dark and have flattened bodies – make them hard to detect, he says. In many cases the bites are the only evidence of bed-bug presence. They're often flat and itchy and appear in arcs of three on the skin, which are nauseatingly described by some as “breakfast, lunch and dinner.”</p>
<p>After a sleepless night in her Toronto condo in April, Jessica showed up to work groggy and on edge. When her co-workers asked if she was okay, she broke down into tears and confessed she might have bed bugs.</p>
<p>“They said, ‘We're going to support you, but we're not going to touch you or go near you,'” she recalls.</p>
<p>For Jessica, 26, who did not want her last name used for fear of seeing her property value decline, the pests not only consumed her blood (as evidenced by the bite marks all over her body), but also her thoughts. Could she hug her colleagues? Could she have guests over? Was it okay for her to sleep at a friend's place?</p>
<p>While she'd dealt with her share of cockroach, mice and ant infestations in previous Toronto apartments, the bed bugs affected her the most, she says.</p>
<p>For weeks, even after two visits by an exterminator who sprayed her apartment, she'd come home from work and search every nook and cranny in the house for bed-bug carcasses.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to find evidence, to find proof they were there,” she says.</p>
<p>On websites such as Bedbugger.com, users – cloaked in anonymity – share tales of how their own bed-bug problems affected their sleep and their ability to concentrate at work. Many confess to feeling shame about their infestations and being labelled as unhygienic – despite the fact that even luxury condos and five-star hotels have been sites of infestations.</p>
<p>In Michelle Heath's Winnipeg apartment, there's a light sprinkling of white powder around all the baseboards.</p>
<p>“I look like a cocaine addict,” the 24-year-old office manager says with a laugh. “I just need to know there's something there.”</p>
<p>A year ago, at her previous residence, Ms. Heath discovered bed bugs just a few weeks after she moved in. Her apartment was sprayed, but it didn't solve the problem, so she found a new place to live.</p>
<p>During the ordeal, she only told her bosses about the problem – and that was just because she needed time off to deal with it. She feared others at the office would treat her differently if they knew.</p>
<p>“I felt like a total freak because I had bed bugs,” she says. “Do I go to work, do I not go to work?”</p>
<p>While she gets more shut-eye now than she did a year ago – when it was only three or four hours a night – she says thoughts about the bloodsuckers keep her up and have caused her to overthink everything.</p>
<p>“[Bed bugs] poo on your bedding and it's like little black spots. So any time I see a little black spot, nine times out of 10 it's lint or something, but I have to look at it right away and figure out what it is,” she says.</p>
<p>In Toronto, the fact that bed bugs are on the rise has alarmed some non-profit organizations and second-hand merchants, as well.</p>
<p>Red Door Family Shelter, a Toronto charity, stopped accepting donations of upholstered furniture and mattresses this spring because of the city's bed-bug problem. “We were receiving complaints from our ex-residents who had received [furniture],” Bernnitta Hawkins, the organization's executive director, says.</p>
<p>The cost of testing furniture for bed bugs is so high that it just made more sense to turn down all couches, armchairs and mattresses, putting the onus on residents to use what little money they have to make such purchases themselves.</p>
<p>Ms. Heath trashed her brand-new $1,000 mattress and all other furniture when she moved to a new apartment, but she still sometimes worries bed bugs may be lurking in various corners of her apartment: hiding in shoes, burrowing under her box spring, scurrying up her bedroom walls at night.</p>
<p>“Even if there hasn't been one, you're totally psychologically like, ‘I can feel it! I can feel it!'”</p>

</p>
<p>The good news is that a repeat of the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic isn't expected this fall; the bad news is that the "usual flu season" will begin in November and last until April.</p>
<p>When the flu season will peak can never be predicted, said Dr. Reka Gustafson, who specializes in communicable diseases for the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority.</p>
<p>She said that last year, "the population wasn't immunized for the new strain [of influenza] and the outbreaks were more explosive and the peak was sharper," adding that after the second wave struck in October, it declined substantially.</p>
<p>But long lineups for flu shots, which were doled out last year on a priority basis, won't be seen this year as health authorities gear up to provide the shot starting in mid-October at public health offices and community centres. People can also request a flu shot from their doctors.</p>
<p>This year's shots will be for Influenza A California, Influenza A Perth and B strain Brisbane. The virus is always named after the place it was first identified.</p>
<p>Gustafson said anyone at high risk of complications if they get the flu is urged to get a shot. They include anyone over the age of 65, those with chronic illnesses, those particularly at risk for respiratory and cardiac problems, pregnant women and children under two.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>An estimated 30 per cent of people with AIDS and its precursor HIV condition don't know they're infected, local AIDS Committee positive prevention co-ordinator Megan DePutter said Thursday.</p>
<p>As of this Oct. 6, the committee, in partnership with Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health, is increasing free, immediate-results testing at its Woolwich Street headquarters to every Wednesday from the current twice monthly.</p>
<p>It's also launching an awareness campaign to promote testing and a healthy lifestyle for those with elevated risk of contracting the disease, such as intravenous drug users sharing needles and men having unprotected sex with other men.</p>
<p>But DePutter stressed no one is immune.</p>
<p>"Anyone is at risk," said DePutter.</p>
<p>Too often, she fears, people at risk don't want to be tested.</p>
<p>"They're afraid and they think: What's the point? What is knowing going to do for me?' "</p>
<p>Plenty, she said, pointing to the wealth of information, accommodation, educational workshops and other support the AIDS Committee of Guelph and Wellington County offers.</p>
<p>Further, with today's medical advances, AIDS, afflicting at least 26,600 Ontarians in 2008, is more a chronic ailment than a death sentence, she added.</p>
<p>Though some people hesitate to be tested, DePutter said demand for testing is increasing locally, hence the need for more.</p>
<p>Her office at 409 Woolwich St., near London Road, offers testing from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. every first and third Wednesday, but that will rise to weekly during those hours.</p>
<p>Testing results are available immediately, with no appointment necessary at the AIDS Committee site. It's an anonymous procedure, with people not required to identify themselves or present provincial health cards.</p>
<p>The testing is carried out by public health, which also offers tests by appointment at its sexual health clinic at 600 Southgate Dr. and occasionally at Guelph's Stonehenge therapeutic centre.</p>
<p>"Our clinics are quite busy," said Rosalyn LaRochelle, manager of public health youth and adult clinical services. She noted last year her organization performed almost 1,000 HIV tests across the region it serves.</p>
<p>The coming changes restore weekly testing in place until the health board refocussed last year on emerging risks, primarily the H1N1 flu threat, LaRochelle added.</p>
<p>The AIDS Committee will shortly begin a public awareness campaign to encourage more frequent testing. The campaign includes posters, wallet cards, advertising and social media.</p>
<p>It begins Sept. 27 and rolls out in stages. More information is available online at: www.aidsguelph.org[http://www.aidsguelph.org]</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Food-safety violations increase Health unit finds more infractions despite fewer visits</b>
</div><div>By Frances Barrick   </div>
<div>Record Staff</div>
<div>347 words</div><div>16 September 2010</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>The Waterloo regional public health unit spotted more food-safety violations despite doing fewer inspections of eating establishments, according to a 2009 report.</p>
<p>"If you are out there less, there could be more infractions," said Chris Komorowski, regional manager of food safety.</p>
<p>The province mandates that high-risk premises, such as hospitals and cafeterias, be inspected three times a year, and that medium-risk premises, such as fast-food restaurants, are inspected twice a year.</p>
<p>However, this requirement was achieved only 73 per cent of the time for high-risk premises and 68 per cent for medium-risk establishments because inspectors were taken off the road to undergo training for a new computer system, Komorowski said. Inspectors also assisted at the H1N1 immunization clinics.</p>
<p>But he said he doesn't believe public health was compromised by the fewer inspections.</p>
<p>"We would have preferred to be out there doing more inspections but again we didn't sacrifice (inspections) to the point where it could be a health hazard to the community," Komorowski said.</p>
<p>Last year, 3,467 inspections were conducted, down 845 from 2008. Inspectors identified</p>
<p>2,629 food-safety infractions, up</p>
<p>10 per cent from 2008.</p>
<p>In 2009, 28 charges were laid against 13 food establishments, compared with 36 charges laid against 19 premises in 2008. In both years, five premises were ordered closed.</p>
<p>Komorowski said inspectors try to work with food operators to ensure minimum standards are met before laying charges.</p>
<p>The most common charge was failing to protect food from contamination or adulteration, followed by failing to keep premises clean or sanitary.</p>
<p>Inspectors destroyed</p>
<p>3,002 kilograms of food deemed unfit for human consumption, almost double the 1,535 kilograms of food thrown out in 2008. In 2009, Spreitzer's Meats in Kitchener was ordered closed three times, and in each case, a large quantity of meats was destroyed, Komorowski said.</p>
<p>There are about 2,500 food premises in the region.</p>

<p>Saskatchewan's decision to cover the cost of seasonal flu shots this year is being applauded by the country's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones was in Saskatoon Wednesday at the Agricultural Biotechnology International Conference to speak about pandemic preparation. In an interview following the panel session, he said each province sets its own priorities, but the general trend is toward more vaccine coverage.</p>
<p>"I think that's a fine idea," he said. "The focus generally for flu campaigns, other than pandemic, has been those at greatest risk of severe disease or dying. But the more people who are immune, the less chance it will spread."</p>
<p>The province announced last week it would be providing the seasonal flu shot free of charge this year. One of the three components in the vaccine protects against H1N1, which health officials say will be circulating again this fall. Drop-in clinics begin in Saskatoon on Oct. 12.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones delivered an address on pandemics as part of a panel on emerging health concerns at the international conference, which ended Wednesday. He spoke about lessons Canada learned during the H1N1 outbreak last year that killed 428 Canadians, including 15 Saskatchewan residents.</p>

<p>Tonight, in Mexico City's massive central plaza, President Felipe Calderon will engage in the yearly ritual of reciting Father Miguel Hidalgo's "El Grito de Dolores," a call for Mexican independence from the Spanish. The same colourful exercise will be repeated in many of the nation's 31 states, beginning the annual Independence Day celebrations -- major blowouts which make Bastille Day, the Fourth of July and Canada Day almost seem like understated bank holidays by comparison. Few citizens on earth enjoy a party like our neighbours, vacation hosts and NAFTA partners to the south.</p>
<p>The 2010 edition has special significance, since it marks both the bicentennial of Hidalgo's independence cry on Sept. 16 1810, and also -- on November 20 -- 100 years since the start of the Mexican revolution, designed to rid the nation of dictatorship and restore democracy.</p>
<p>Modern Mexican history -- like its ancient past -- has never been neat, clear-cut or morally satisfactory. For his troubles, Hidalgo was executed by the vengeful Spanish. The revolution, with its memorable cast of characters from Emiliano Zapata to Pancho Villa, raged on for nearly a decade, with over one million victims.</p>
<p>Nor is Mexico's present, sad to say, by any means settled, for all the country's pleasures, rich cultural legacy and vast potential.</p>
<p>In spite of the government's myriad efforts to make 2010 a non-stop fiesta, most neutral observers have found the national mood to be gloomy unto morose. The latest downer, of course, is the four-year-plus drug war, which has claimed an estimated 28,000 lives to date, infecting some of the country's once-safest locales.</p>
<p>Ciudad Juarez, on the border across from El Paso, Texas, is almost certainly the most dangerous city on the continent, so toxic that all of this week's celebrations have been cancelled, a damning fate it shares with at least two dozen other municipalities.</p>
<p>Add to that recent devastating storms, the H1N1 virus and news that the PRI party that ruled the country for 70 years is ahead in the polls is enough to dampen many spirits. Still, celebrate they shall, and thousands of Canadians -- especially Albertans -- who have grown to love the country, its people and rich lore will continue to travel south each year to one of the planet's special places.</p>
<p>Mexico will rise again. It's fitting that Canadians raise a glass to our Mexican friends this week, looking ahead with them to better days, while honouring a history rich in achievement, disappointment and hope.</p>

<p>When Katie and Jay VanDenDriessche booked their dream wedding in Mexico for May 2009, the last thing they expected to ruin their plans was an outbreak of the swine flu.</p>
<p>"We had booked a trip through (Goliger's Travel) to Mexico for 24 of us," Katie recalls.</p>
<p>Goliger's Travel owner Sarah Hupalo had booked not only the flights and hotel reservations for the couple and their guests, but had also coordinated the entire wedding, including the ceremony and reception, for the VanDenDriessches.</p>
<p>"Then, 10 days before the wedding," Katie pauses with a sigh, "the swine flu hit.</p>
<p>"When we found out the amount of work it would take to make sure we could still get married, it hit us that it was a really, really good thing that we had booked our wedding through a travel agency."</p>
<p>If the VanDenDriessches wanted to go through with their destination wedding, they had to quickly choose an alternative destination. It was decided that they would move the wedding to Jamaica, but the intricacies of moving such a major event - in the span of 10 days - would have been too large of an undertaking for the couple to do alone.</p>
<p>Katie says that even a simple flight cancellation was difficult. "We found out that in order to get your money back for a cancelled flight, you had to prove it was because of a certain level of urgency," she says, adding that even with such a dangerous outbreak as the swine flu, the airline resisted their requests for cancellation.</p>
<p>"The airline just wouldn't release the tickets. I don't know how Sarah did it, but she did. We definitely couldn't have done it ourselves."</p>
<p>Up until that point, the wedding planning had been absolutely stress-free; Hupalo had booked the VanDenDriessche wedding in its entirety, including flights, ceremony and reception locations, hotel rooms and essential amenities for each of the 24 guests and working with a Mexican-based wedding planner to ensure the wedding day would go without a hitch for the couple. Now, her main focus was to re-book the entire wedding, from start to finish, in another tropical location.</p>
<p>"We were in the office sometimes until 1 in the morning, changing flights and re-booking everything," says Hupalo. "When we book a wedding for a couple, we sit down with them, discuss what destinations they would most enjoy. We discuss the dynamics of the group. Are they golfers? Divers? We work within their budget and make sure it's something that they and their guests can afford. Even though a destination wedding is in many ways easier to plan than one at home, there's a lot of thought and effort that goes into a destination wedding, which can take anywhere from six months to a year.</p>
<p>"So when this happened, it was crazy. It was like starting from scratch, but we had less than two weeks to do it. But we did it."</p>

<p>Re: "Teachers, please retire so we can work," by Barbara J. Sowak, Letters, Sept. 12.</p>
<p>Barbara J. Sowak has yet to learn that universities and other schools who grant academic credentials do not promise jobs.</p>
<p>They run profitable businesses that exploit hope, an expectation for a better future income.</p>
<p>In the case of teachers, many cannot retire because they have decades of working as substitute teachers, paid at a rate from one-half to onethird of their salary grid value based on education and experience.</p>
<p>Substitute teachers lack benefits to repair teeth or maintain health. If they are financially practical, they cannot afford to marry or have children. They cannot afford to own or rent a house or even maintain utilities without combining their incomes with someone else. They cannot afford to eat at restaurants or any entertainment unless they have another source of income.</p>
<p>In essence, they are still waiting for an opportunity to be a financially independent person.</p>
<p>Last year Edmonton Public Schools over-estimated the second wave of H1N1 and increased its sub list from 800 to 1,800 teachers, meaning instead of working every day, one worked from one-half to two-and-a-half days a week, on average.</p>
<p>In order to hire inexperienced graduating teachers to replace anticipated retirements, Edmonton Public's plan was to ignore decades of underpaid work by substitute teachers so Edmonton Public could hire inexperienced graduating teachers who would earn one-half to onethird the grid salary of their working experienced substitute teachers.</p>
<p>Edmonton Public Schools held a substitute meeting in June stating it would not reactivate 1,000 substitutes to provide enough work for 800 so they could make room to hire graduating students to replace retiring teachers.</p>
<p>Asking a group of teachers to retire when they have not been allowed to work is a form of age discrimination all too common in our society.</p>
<p>While one could add further education to obtain a doctoral to teach at a university, university instructors must retire at age 65.</p>
<p>If one began teaching at the age of 40, taught as a substitute teacher until age 53, already has six university degrees, will one more will make a difference in obtaining a full-time job to earn an independent income?</p>
<p>Academic credentials are designed to allow elites a legitimate reason to hire their family and friends, but for everyone else, academic credentials offer nothing but student loan debt.</p>
<p>I cannot afford to retire. I am still trying to obtain a full-time, permanent teaching position so I can live my life, be financially independent, maintain my health and pay off my student loans. If there is justice, graduates will have to wait in line instead of jumping the queue.</p>
<p>A teacher who has not been allowed to work as a teacher has no intention of retiring and no financial means of retiring. So Sowak, the answer is no.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Salt rules will get some bite; Ministers want to ensure restaurants, processed food makers comply with sodium reductions</b>
</div><div>Jonathan Fowlie And Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>
<div>Postmedia News, with Vancouver Sun files</div>
<div>753 words</div><div>14 September 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Provincial health ministers agreed Monday to develop new regulations that would add teeth to the voluntary limits put forward by the federal government on sodium levels in restaurants and in processed food.</p>
<p>British Columbia Health Services Minister Kevin Falcon said Monday the proposed new system would come into effect if the industry does not properly adhere to the voluntary standards.</p>
<p>"What the provinces will be recommending to the federal minister (Tuesday) is that while we accept the voluntary targets that (federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq) has put forward with her sodium working group, that the provinces are going to have their officials work to develop a national regulatory mechanism that will kick in if the federal targets are not being reached," said Falcon.</p>
<p>"We will accept the voluntary targets but we want them backstopped by a regulatory mechanism that will kick in should industry fail to meet the voluntary targets that have been put in place."</p>
<p>The health ministers also agreed Monday to lay the groundwork for clinical trials of a controversial multiple sclerosis treatment, as well as continued talks on joining forces to purchase drugs in bulk to cut down growing health-care costs.</p>
<p>A number of items were on the agenda at the annual intergovernmental meeting, including lessons learned from the H1N1 pandemic and the sodium reduction strategies, but discussions around MS research took much of the focus here.</p>
<p>The provinces agreed to form a working group that will essentially look at making preparations for pan-Canadian clinical trials of the angioplasty procedure being used in MS patients that is known as liberation therapy.</p>
<p>The federal and provincial governments have been under pressure to support access to the experimental procedure in Canada -- it was started by an Italian doctor and is being conducted in a handful of countries -- but its safety and effectiveness are the subject of ongoing debate.</p>
<p>An expert panel convened by the federal government to review Dr. Paolo Zamboni's theory that blocked veins are related to MS, and his treatment, recently reported that there isn't enough evidence yet to warrant clinical trials and that MS research already underway should be concluded first.</p>
<p>The provinces agreed Monday that if and when the evidence comes in and calls for national clinical trials, they want to be ready to go and not waste any time getting them off the ground.</p>
<p>"We've directed our departments, our officials, to work collaboratively through the formation of a provincial working group to examine if we can responsibly accelerate medical and scientific processes examining Dr. Zamboni's treatment so we can move to clinical trials when and if the evidence is available," Nova Scotia's health minister, Maureen MacDonald said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Manitoba Health Minister Theresa Oswald described the initiative as "setting the table" for a multi-site trial of Zamboni's procedure. She said there is consensus among the provinces that they should work together "if and when the time comes" for a pan-Canadian study.</p>
<p>In the meantime, provinces will proceed with MS research projects underway in their jurisdictions. Four such major projects are being conducted in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan and on Monday, Newfoundland and Labrador announced it is funding a study of patients who go abroad for the liberation therapy.</p>
<p>It won't pay for the procedure, but at least $320,000 will be devoted to monitoring MS patients who travel abroad for it. Local neurologists will examine patients before and after the treatment at periodic intervals and patients will be paired with others who do not have the treatment to compare its effectiveness.</p>
<p>"In meetings with neurologists over the last couple of weeks we decided that this would be a good approach," Newfoundland Health Minister Jerome Kennedy said.</p>
<p>"It was on the advice of these neurologists and it's something that will hopefully produce evidence that will tell us one way or another, whether the Zamboni procedure works."</p>
<p>It isn't known exactly how many Canadians have travelled abroad for liberation treatment and currently, there is no co-ordinated mechanism in place, either within provinces or nationally, to track them.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Five foreign dividend stocks that can afford to boost payouts; These holdings offer some much-needed diversification for Canadian investors</b>
</div><div>John Heinzl  </div>
<div>972 words</div><div>13 September 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail (Breaking News)</div><div>GMBN</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

  </div>
</p>
<p>Investment Reporter --</p>
<p>Banks, pipelines, banks, utilities, more banks – being a dividend investor in Canada can get a bit monotonous. For greater diversification, you need to look beyond Canada’s borders.</p>
<p>Only by venturing into the U.S. market and abroad can you get exposure to some of the world’s top consumer products, health care and technology companies – sectors in which Canada is woefully under-represented.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we asked Ian Riach, manager of the Bissett Multinational Growth Fund, to discuss some of his top dividend picks, focusing on those that are likely to increase their payouts.</p>
<p>When choosing stocks, Mr. Riach starts by screening for dividend-paying companies that generate at least 20 per cent of their revenue from outside their home country. He then ranks the companies based on dividend yield (the higher the better), payout ratio (the lower the better) and the number of dividend increases over the past five and 10 years (the higher the better).</p>
<p>“If a company has consistently increased its dividend over a number of years, has a decent yield and a low payout ratio, that, to me, indicates – and we’ve done some back-testing on this – that the dividend is sustainable, that they should keep paying it and they should keep growing it,” he says.</p>
<p>If a stock passes the initial tests, Mr. Riach then digs into the company’s fundamentals before adding it to his fund. Here are five companies that made the cut:</p>
<p>Johnson & Johnson</p>
<p>Yield: 3.6 per cent</p>
<p>Five-year annualized dividend growth: 10.9 per cent</p>
<p>Payout ratio: 43.4 per cent (percentage of trailing 12-month profit paid out as dividends)</p>
<p>Johnson & Johnson’s stock has been battered by quality-control problems at several plants and recalls of more than 100 million bottles of over-the-counter medicines such as adult and children's Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and Zyrtec.</p>
<p>“This is a company that’s had some challenges, there’s no question,” Mr. Riach says.</p>
<p>But J&J is still immensely profitable, has a triple-A credit rating, and its operating cash flow covers the dividend by about three times, leaving plenty of room for dividend hikes. What’s more, because of the company’s (likely temporary) problems, the stock is trading at less than 12 times estimated 2011 earnings</p>
<p>PepsiCo Inc.</p>
<p>Yield: 2.9 per cent</p>
<p>Five-year annualized dividend growth: 13.7 per cent</p>
<p>Payout ratio: 46.6 per cent</p>
<p>Faced with a flat soft drink market in North America, PepsiCo has successfully turned to non-carbonated beverages and snack foods to drive growth, which is especially strong in emerging markets such as China and India.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company completed the acquisition of two its bottling companies, Pepsi Bottling Group and check? Pepsi Americas. The moves are expected to achieve $400-million (U.S.) in cost savings annually by 2012.</p>
<p>“Here’s another company that has consistently increased its dividend,” he says. “Their operating cash flow covers that dividend probably 2.5 to three times, so that dividend is safe in my mind and has the ability to grow.”</p>
<p>McDonald’s Corp.</p>
<p>Yield: 3 per cent</p>
<p>Five-year annualized dividend growth: 32 per cent</p>
<p>Payout ratio: 49.2 per cent</p>
<p>Whether you’re a customer or an investor, you have to be impressed with the transformation of McDonald’s over the past few years. While tweaking its menu with healthier items, rolling out McCafés and overhauling its stale advertising, the company also adopted a more shareholder-friendly attitude that includes juicy dividend hikes.</p>
<p>You know McDonald’s is doing something right when Europe – the birthplace of haute cuisine – is one of its fastest-growing regions. But it’s not like the stock market hasn’t already noticed.</p>
<p>With the stock up more than 35 per cent in the past year and bumping near a record high, “valuation is starting to become a bit of an issue,” Mr. Riach says.</p>
<p>Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>Yield: 2.2 per cent</p>
<p>Five-year annualized dividend growth: 10.2 per cent</p>
<p>Payout ratio: 24.2 per cent</p>
<p>Everyone loves to slag Microsoft. It’s lazy. It doesn’t know how to innovate. It has weak growth prospects. But one thing it does have is lots and lots of cash: About $37-billion, or more than $4 a share, in cash and short-term investments as of June 30.</p>
<p>Now, investors are agitating to get some of that money back in the form of rising dividends. The software giant last hiked its dividend in 2008, but Mr. Riach said “significant” dividend increases could resume soon.</p>
<p>With the current dividend covered more than five times by operating cash flow, Microsoft could certainly afford a hike. And with a P/E of 10 times this year’s earnings, “at this price I think it represents good value,” he says.</p>
<p>GlaxoSmithKline PLC</p>
<p>Yield: 4.6 per cent</p>
<p>Five-year annualized dividend growth: 5.2 per cent</p>
<p>Payout ratio: 55.9 per cent</p>
<p>Like most big pharmaceutical companies, GlaxoSmithKline is grappling with patent expirations on some of its best-selling drugs and tighter regulation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which may delay the development of new medicines.</p>
<p>“It’s not like they don’t have anything in the pipeline. In their vaccine areas, Glaxo is making some pretty big inroads there,” he says. Anyone who got one of Glaxo’s H1N1 shots knows that’s true.</p>
<p>But while shareholders wait for the next blockbuster drug, the company spins off a 4.6-per-cent yield, has a clean balance sheet, and trades at just 11 times estimated 2010 earnings.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Alberta studying new MS therapy; Health minister seeks advice of colleagues</b>
</div><div>Jamie Komarnicki   </div>
<div>For the Calgary Herald; with files from Postmedia News</div>
<div>955 words</div><div>13 September 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Heading to meetings with provincial and federal counterparts, Alberta Health Minister Gene Zwozdesky opened the door to more discussion around a controversial new multiple sclerosis treatment -- but wouldn't commit to funding clinical trials of the unproven therapy.</p>
<p>Zwozdesky said he'll seek more information on the so-called liberation procedure during the annual meetings with the nation's health ministers in Newfoundland and Labrador beginning today.</p>
<p>The federal government is holding off on funding nationwide clinical trials on the treatment proposed by an Italian doctor after expert MS researchers said last month there isn't enough scientific evidence to prove it's safe or effective.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan has promised to forge ahead and finance clinical trials, whether or not there's support from Ottawa.</p>
<p>Zwozdesky said he's planning to have a private conversation with Saskatchewan Health Minister Don McMorris to learn more details about that province's approach.</p>
<p>"I'd be interested to know what their framework is and what the terms of reference for that will be, what the costs will be, where they intend to do that," Zwozdesky said.</p>
<p>The minister said he'll also explore whether Saskatchewan is looking for other provinces to "become partners" with them, and take that information back to his Alberta government colleagues.</p>
<p>A briefing is scheduled with Canadian Institutes of Health Research experts during the health meetings to explain their recent recommendation that there not be Canada-wide clinical trials of the procedure, which was proposed by Italian vascular surgeon Paolo Zamboni last year.</p>
<p>In Alberta, a 13-member task force is reviewing emerging clinical data on the treatment. The procedure is based on the theory that blocked veins leads to a buildup of iron in the brain, which then causes symptoms for MS patients. The treatment involves inserting small balloons or stents into blocked veins.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services has cautioned MS patients to be wary of some of the information around the treatment and noted the procedure could cause severe medical problems.</p>
<p>But for some patients who've suffered from debilitating MS symptoms, the possibility of some relief has proved irresistible, and they've travelled abroad to the handful of countries offering the therapy.</p>
<p>In March, Michelle Zanini went to India to undergo the Zamboni treatment. She returned to Calgary with less pain, greater stability and a much more positive outlook on the disease she's battled for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>Since then, she's regressed, with some pain and stiffness returning, but the symptoms aren't at the same level, said her husband Steve. The couple is convinced another bout of therapy will help Michelle and they stand by the benefits of the procedure. If possible, Michelle is planning another procedure in the new year, possibly in Albany, N.Y., or Bulgaria.</p>
<p>"Regardless of where the governments are sitting, we're still moving forward anyway," Steve said.</p>
<p>The couple doesn't claim the treatment is a cure, but the improvement -- and hope -- it has offered Michelle has proved worthwhile and they believe others should have the same opportunity in Canada.</p>
<p>"We're not being naive in this approach. We know the risks we're taking."</p>
<p>There's no tally of how many Albertans have travelled abroad to get the treatment, but the Alberta division of the MS Society of Canada estimates about 100 patients have tried Zamboni's procedure.</p>
<p>The group is pushing for the Alberta government to sign on to clinical trials and said they were encouraged Zwozdesky is continuing to explore the matter.</p>
<p>Testimonials from patients should hold sway with decision-makers, said Neil Pierce, president of the branch.</p>
<p>"I think their voice is important as well to influence this as a priority. If the evidence isn't there, then proceeding to trials will get us there quicker."</p>
<p>Zwozdesky, who has met with MS patients who've undergone the treatment, said they present a "compelling" case. He'll seek out further information from the medical community and other provinces this week, the minister added.</p>
<p>"As I gather that information, I'll bring it back here and I'll have the discussion with cabinet and colleagues, then we'll see what it is we might do."</p>
<p>The health meetings this week will also cover a range of Canada-wide topics.</p>
<p>The ministers will also evaluate the country's H1N1 pandemic responses in individual provinces and Canada-wide, Zwozdesky said, and look at ways to address the rising costs of pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Zwozdesky said he plans to tackle several wellness issues in advance of a conference being planned for Edmonton in December. He'll also take up Alberta's case on health transfer payments, the minister added.</p>
<p>Another issue the provinces are expected to raise with federal health minister Leona Aglukkaq is the added costs they incurred for medical isotopes during the year-long shutdown of the Chalk River, Ont., nuclear reactor. Its closure prompted a worldwide shortage of the isotopes required for diagnostic imaging and some medical treatments, driving up the price and causing logistical nightmares for nuclear medicine specialists and hospitals.</p>
<p>Health promotion initiatives will also be talked about and a co-ordinated strategy to enhance healthy living among Canadians could be announced by the federal government and provinces by the end of Tuesday, Postmedia has learned.</p>

</p>
<p>When Canada's provincial and territorial health ministers gathered for their annual meetings last year at this time, one topic dominated their discussions -- that nasty flu bug called H1N1.</p>
<p>About a month after they met in Winnipeg in September 2009, the H1N1 vaccine was approved and the biggest immunization program in Canadian history was underway.</p>
<p>This year's agenda features much more variety, though the ministers will spend some time talking about the successes and failures experienced in each of their jurisdictions in rolling out the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>The health ministers meet here today and on Tuesday with their federal counterpart -- Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>There are numerous issues up for discussion over the two days but one that is not formally on the agenda is expected to generate a good deal of attention -- multiple sclerosis and Ottawa's decision to hold off on supporting clinical trials of the controversial procedure known as liberation treatment.</p>
<p>"I know there will be a lot of discussion around that," Saskatchewan's Health Minister Don McMorris said in an interview last week.</p>
<p>He expects the issue to be raised during the time set aside for informal discussions.</p>
<p>The MS debate is of particular interest to Saskatchewan, which has the highest rate of the debilitating neurological disease in the country. The province has committed to backing clinical trials of the liberation treatment pioneered by an Italian doctor that is only offered in a handful of countries.</p>
<p>Canadian patients, desperate for some relief, have been travelling abroad for the operation, which involves inserting small balloons or stents into blocked veins. An expert panel convened by Ottawa reported there isn't enough scientific evidence on Dr. Paolo Zamboni's procedure to prove that it is safe or effective.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq accepted the panel's recommendation that the government wait for more evidence on Zamboni's theory linking blocked veins to MS before proceeding with trials.</p>
<p>McMorris said Saskatchewan still wants to partner with the federal government, or with other provinces, to test the treatment in Canada.</p>
<p>"From my perspective, yes it needs to be proven, or it needs to be dis-proven," he said. "I think that helps families with MS just as much, so that perhaps they're not spending dollars to go have a procedure done that doesn't have any scientific basis. We need to know that ourselves."</p>
<p>Another issue the provinces are expected to raise with Aglukkaq is the added costs they incurred for medical isotopes during the yearlong shutdown of the Chalk River, Ont., nuclear reactor. Its closure prompted a worldwide shortage of the isotopes required for diagnostic imaging and some medical treatments, driving up the price and causing logistical nightmares for nuclear medicine specialists and hospitals.</p>
<p>Some provinces are seeking compensation from Ottawa, whose responsibility it is to ensure a stable supply of isotopes. They are also concerned about the country's future supply of isotopes because the reactor's lifespan is quickly coming to an end and there is no clear plan for replacing it.</p>
<p>Health promotion initiatives will also be talked about and a co-ordinated strategy to enhance healthy living among Canadians could be announced by the federal government and provinces by the end of Tuesday, Postmedia has learned.</p>
<p>Rising health-care costs are another major concern for the provinces and the health ministers will also discuss the agreement reached by their premiers last month to pool their purchasing power for drugs.</p>

</p>
<p>The regular use of alcohol-based disinfecting hand gels authorities recommended during the H1N1 flu pandemic has little effect on the disease's infection rate, according to a study published Sunday. The findings suggest the pandemic virus and similar flu strains are most effectively transmitted in the air, rather than by contact with infected surfaces, the authors of the study said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vic doubles size of ER to meet growing demand -</b>

<p>Health officials say a newly expanded emergency room in Winnipeg's south end will be able to better serve some of the city's fastest growing neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, patients with urgent or life-threatening illnesses will no longer be cramped in the Victoria General Hospital's ER. The first part of the hospital's new $20.5 million ER space, which was unveiled Friday, will start taking patients in an area that's twice the size of the old ER.</p>
<p>Victoria General Hospital chief operating officer Francis LaBossiere said the old ER was initially built to handle 9,000 patients, but now sees 30,000 patients every year. He said that's forced staff to maximize "every nook and cranny," and care for patients in a tight space that is not ideal.</p>
<p>The new space includes a private family room, an extra ambulance garage, a bariatric shower and washroom, and a special room for patients with mental health issues.</p>
<p>LaBossiere said the old ER will remain open until the redevelopment is complete next fall, and will be used as a treatment space for minor injuries or reassessment. Next week, he said all patients will be triaged by nurses at the new entrance, and the new space will be used to care for patients who are critically ill.</p>
<p>"We are within the fastest growing segment of our city and we must work diligently with our partners to address the growing need of our population," LaBossiere said.</p>
<p>The ER expansion and redevelopment is part of a larger provincial push to improve care on the heels of Brian Sinclair's death.</p>
<p>Sinclair, a wheelchair-bound aboriginal man, was found dead in the Health Sciences Centre ER on Sept. 21, 2008. He waited 34 hours to see a doctor to be treated for a bladder infection that required a simple catheter change and antibiotics.</p>
<p>Health Minister Theresa Oswald said plans to upgrade and improve city ERs were in the works prior to Sinclair's death, but the incident triggered amendments to improve triage and patient visibility.</p>
<p>She said the Victoria hospital's new ER has a "hub" for nurses, so they are able to easily see and identify patients.</p>
<p>"They can really see everyone and what's going on really, really well, compared to the previous environment and that is an important step forward," Oswald said.</p>
<p>Overall, emergency room visits have steadily increased in the past few years at all Winnipeg hospitals.</p>
<p>According to Winnipeg Regional Health Authority statistics, 280,890 patients visited a city ER in 2009/2010 -- up from 256,864 the previous year. WRHA officials said part of the reason behind the dramatic increase was the large number of visits during the H1N1 pandemic.</p>

<p>Infection from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus presented a lower risk of serious complications than other recent strains of the flu, according to U.S. research presented yesterday.</p>
<p>Analysis of influenza cases in Wisconsin showed infected individuals were younger than in earlier strains, but complications were not as likely as with the H3N1 virus that arose in the 2007-2008 flu season, said researchers at Wisconsin's Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation.</p>
<p>The researchers compared the characteristics of pandemic and seasonal influenza infections, drawing from a pool of 6,874 patients in three flu seasons starting in 2007.</p>
<p>Researchers identified 545 H1N1 pandemic influenza cases in 2009, and 221 cases of the seasonal H1N1 flu, and 632 patients with H3N2 infection from the 2007-2008 season.</p>
<p>Children, which the 2009 H1N1 pandemic infection appeared to disproportionately affect, were not associated with more hospital admission or pneumonia cases when compared with seasonal H1N1 or H3N2, the study said.</p>
<p>Within 30 days of infection, six out of 395 children with the 2009 H1N1 virus, or 1.5 per cent, were admitted to hospital, compared with five of 135 with seasonal H1N1 (3.7 per cent) and eight of 255 with H3N2 (3.1 per cent). For adults, six out of 150 with 2009 H1N1 (four per cent) went to hospital, compared with 17 out of 377 cases of H3N2 (4.5 per cent).</p>

<p>A newly released American study suggests the public often rejects the opinions of scientific experts.</p>
<p>The public tends not to trust scientists, says research from California -- but there's a twist. People are mainly reluctant to believe good news, it turns out -- such as the message that a flu vaccine is safe. But the public is more likely to trust the researchers who frighten with bad news.</p>
<p>Overall, the study, published in a research journal called Public Understanding of Science, concludes that "scientists' efforts to influence public opinion have a limited effect."</p>
<p>The work is based on a public opinion survey of 1,475 Californians to assess whether people trust safety studies on offshore oil drilling. It predates this summer's massive oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico, but offshore oil drilling has been a hot political issue in California for years.</p>
<p>The analysis from professors at the University of California at Santa Barbara found that people tended to disregard much of what the safety studies found. The limited amount they did believe tended to be the parts that showed dangers were worse than they had feared.</p>
<p>The study suggests one reason conspiracy theories spread so easily on the Internet: they're often based on scary scenarios, such as the mind-control chemicals that governments are allegedly spraying from commercial airliners.</p>
<p>Last winter, Ottawa's public health leaders met an unexpected hurdle: many people refused to trust the H1N1 vaccine's safety despite reassurances from the medical establishment.</p>
<p>"People were dubious. There was a healthy dose of people who were concerned about the vaccination and didn't have confidence in it," said City of Ottawa Coun. Diane Deans, who chairs Ottawa's protective services committee.</p>
<p>That distrust kept many people away from vaccination clinics. "We had one of the highest rates of vaccination in the entire province but we certainly didn't vaccinate anywhere near everybody. We got 50 per cent, if I recall," Deans said.</p>

<p>The words from "Ya Got Trouble" (Music Man) keeping repeating in my head.</p>
<p>"Right here in River City. Trouble with a capital T, and that rhymes with P, and that stands for pool! And who's the fool?"</p>
<p>Maybe the image fits -- a stereotypical western rube chewing on a straw in River City. Think about it. We have handed Stephen Harper unwavering and unquestioning support.</p>
<p>He is one of us, our very own "Professor" Harold Hill. Oops, but Harper was educated and grew up in Ontario.</p>
<p>Our Steve was gonna destroy that hated gun control law. Wrong again. Who prorogued Parliament twice and called an election in 2008? And who keeps reintroducing gun bills?</p>
<p>This year there were three before Parliament, C-301 (Garry Breitkreuz did not show up for second reading on orders from "Da Boss"), S-5 (introduced in the Senate by Peter Van Loan and held back by Harper for tactical reasons) and Candice Hoeppner's private members' Bill C-391.</p>
<p>Of these, only C-391 goes before Parliament for third reading near the end of September. Wanna bet we have an election, or enough Conservatives down with H1N1 (oops, last year's excuse) that it goes down to defeat?</p>
<p>After nearly five years in power, Harper has strangely (ha, ha) not been able to shepherd a little bill through Parliament. Why would he? His party is against gun control. Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.</p>

<p>As flu season approaches, so does the decision for families about who should get vaccinated against the virus. And this year Canadians have new options to consider.</p>
<p>First, the vaccine for 2010-2011 also protects against H1N1 virus, unlike last year when separate shots were required.</p>
<p>And for those who shudder at the sight of a syringe, there are two new forms that don't involve being jabbed in the muscle: one is a nasal spray; the other is an intradermal vaccine that uses a tiny needle that is inserted beneath the skin rather than into muscle.</p>
<p>"We're very excited to have new ways to administer vaccines other than (standard) injections," says Dr. Bonnie Henry, chair of the Canadian Coalition for Immunization Awareness and Promotion.</p>
<p>Public health physicians hope that the combined shot, as well as newer forms of vaccines down the road, may mean more Canadians choose to be immunized.</p>
<p>Last year, 42 per cent of Ontarians got a flu shot, while 28 per cent were vaccinated against H1N1. The vaccines are free.</p>
<p>Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization released its annual statement on the flu vaccine today.</p>
<p>In line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, the Canadian seasonal vaccine will incorporate three strains: the 2009 strain known as H1N1; a new influenza A (H3N2); and the same B component as last year.</p>
<p>But unlike in the U.S., where health authorities last week urged everyone over the age of 6 months to receive the vaccine, the Canadian committee put the focus on high-risk groups, such as very young children, seniors, people with other health conditions and health care workers.</p>
<p>"However, influenza vaccine is encouraged for all Canadians who have no (drug risk)," said the statement from the committee, which advises Health Canada on immunization issues.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional vaccine, families in Ontario will have to pay to receive the flu shot if they wish to receive it through one of the two new methods. Prices have not been released, but both FluMist and Intanza are expected to cost more than the regular flu vaccines, which costs the government roughly $10 per injection.</p>
<p>Health Canada recently approved the nasal spray FluMist, Canada's first non-injectible vaccine, which is available for people ages 2 to 59.</p>
<p>The spray is applied to each nostril, where the virus usually enters the body, and unlike regular injections does not contain the preservative thimerosal, which has caused controversy among some groups because of potential low-level toxicity. FluMist has been available in the U.S. since 2003, with 27 million doses distributed to date.</p>
<p>Intanza, also newly approved, uses a needle 10 times smaller than a regular one to inject the vaccine beneath the skin surface.</p>
<p>The intradermal vaccine is available to adults ages 18 to 59.</p>

About 27 million doses of a FluMist, the first non-injectable vaccine, have been distributed in the United States. The vaccine comes to Canada this year, but will have a small fee if you don't want a traditional syringe needle.  </p>

</p>
<p>How can Tyler Bozak explain it so that you understand?</p>
<p>Viktor Stalberg was not just a teammate who was traded to another team. He was Bozak's best friend, his roommate, his workout partner and his brother-in-arms while playing the online video game Call of Duty.</p>
<p>After they joined the Toronto Maple Leafs organization more than a year ago, the two college graduates were inseparable as they chased their dream of becoming NHLers, but Stalberg and prospect Philippe Paradis were sent to the Chicago Blackhawks this summer in exchange for Kris Versteeg.</p>
<p>"[Stalberg] was a great friend of mine," Bozak said. "He called me right after he [was traded]. I think it was four in the morning in Sweden or something like that. He was pretty bent out of shape. But he now knows he has a pretty good opportunity there and it could be a good spot for him."</p>
<p>Despite losing his friend, Bozak still has reason to be excited about what lies ahead. After a slow start to his professional career, which was partly the result of contracting the H1N1 flu virus early last season, the former Victoria Grizzlies captain finished the year as the Leafs' top-line centre. With few other options down the middle, the 24-year-old will likely reprise that role in 2010-11.</p>
<p>That might sound like a large responsibility for an undrafted forward who lacks experience and size, but Bozak, who had eight goals and 27 points in 37 games, seems up for the challenge.</p>
<p>"Every team I've come into, the previous years I've been a rookie or a younger guy and I've been able to step in and do a good job," the Regina native said yesterday. "I came in here a year ago and wasn't sure what to expect. I think those last few games I gained a lot of confidence. And you always play better when you're more confident."</p>
<p>Bozak was one of the players teams asked about this summer, but he was also one of the players Leafs GM Brian Burke refused to part with.</p>

</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>

</p>
<p>Eastern Ontario needs a "regional bed czar" to call the shots on patient transfers, says the chief operating officer of The Ottawa Hospital.</p>
<p>In particular, that person should have the authority to direct to less crowded hospitals elderly patients who are stranded in acute care, awaiting a nursing-home bed, Gino Picciano said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"You need someone who has a regional picture (to) be the pilot to help navigate," Picciano told the hospital's board of governors.</p>
<p>The hospital has a chronic problem with a high number of elderly patients who no longer need acute care, but have nowhere else to go while they wait for a nursing-home bed.</p>
<p>On any given day, 16 per cent, or more than 150 of the hospital's 940 beds, are occupied by such patients. The resulting bed shortages lead to overcrowding, cancelled surgeries and long waits in emergency rooms.</p>
<p>Picciano said his proposed bed czar would plan according to the daily "traffic reports" of patients at all of the region's 22 hospitals. For such a system to work, a real-time "census" of beds across eastern Ontario hospitals would need to be created to allow all institutions to share their data.</p>
<p>"It ain't that complicated to do," Picciano said in an interview.</p>
<p>Each hospital already maintains its own daily list that details, among other things, the number of patients occupying intensive-care beds as well as those waiting for urgent surgery. Yet without a computer network to link all hospitals together, there is no regionwide picture of which hospitals are the busiest and which ones have extra beds that could be used by patients who are transferred there.</p>
<p>Having a bed czar make the call would allow elderly patients from outlying areas to be transferred back to the communities where they live, in hospitals that are often less busy than large, urban ones such as The Ottawa Hospital, said Picciano.</p>
<p>During last year's H1N1 pandemic, Eastern Ontario's health authority appointed a "critical-care czar" to make the call to send critically ill patients to hospitals with less crowded intensive care units.</p>

</p>
<p>The swine flu scare of 2009 turned a spotlight on a controversial issue: Should health care workers be required to have an annual flu vaccine?</p>
<p>Most studies suggest health care workers should be vaccinated to help stop the spread of flu. But surveys show a sizable portion of people who work in hospitals, clinics and doctor's offices don't want to get an annual flu shot.</p>
<p>According to a <span class="companylink">Rand Corp</span>. survey, 39 per cent of health care professionals said they would not get a flu vaccine, even with the threat of pandemic flu.</p>
<p>A policy paper published Tuesday says health care workers are ethically obligated to get a flu vaccine. The paper was written by representatives of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology and is endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.</p>
<p>Agreeing to an annual flu shot should be a condition of initial and continued employment in health care facilities, the authors argue. Exceptions should be permitted only in cases where a flu vaccine is not recommended for medical reasons.</p>
<p>The reasons for the heavy-handed approach are multiple, the authors state.</p>
<p>Voluntary vaccination has not worked to increase the proportion of workers who are immunized. Moreover, studies show the spread of flu is reduced when all workers in a health facility are vaccinated. Death rates from complications of flu also decrease. Finally, mandatory vaccination will mean that a sufficient number of healthy workers will be available during disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>Although some workers have called mandatory policies coercive, there is legal precedent for the mandatory vaccination, the authors note. Already, health care workers in the U.S. are required to have regular tuberculosis skin tests and to show proof of having had other vaccinations.</p>
<p>"Because the likelihood of a serious adverse reaction to influenza vaccine is extremely low, the duty to protect vulnerable patients and to put their interest above the personal interest of the health care worker does not demand undue sacrifice," the authors wrote. The paper is published in the journal Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology.</p>
<p>The move toward mandatory flu vaccination for health care personnel already has begun. During last year's swine flu outbreak, several hospitals implemented a mandatory policy. One hospital chain has adopted mandatory vaccination. And the State of New York Department of Health is writing a permanent regulation for yearly flu vaccination of health care personnel.</p>

</div><div>Sean Myers   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>574 words</div><div>30 August 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>F irefighters are taking nearly double the number of days away from work due to sickness and accidents than they were five years ago.</p>
<p>But the fire department says those statistics are the result of a new method for reporting illness and injury and an innovative wellness centre, which has led to fewer claims to the Workers' Compensation Board and a healthier workforce overall.</p>
<p>Sick days have nearly doubled since 2005, according to the 2009 Annual Fire Report, but the biggest increase came in 2006, when 6,293 lost days were counted, up from 4,147 the previous year.</p>
<p>Calgary Fire Department spokesman Brian McAsey said that jump came as a result of an audit requested by the WCB that led to a new reporting regime.</p>
<p>"(The WCB) determined that we had to have better reporting procedures put in place," said McAsey.</p>
<p>"Before, if someone was injured but it was pretty small or if someone was slightly sick, they would come into work and it wouldn't be a very big deal. Now, if you break a finger or if you have a near miss, you're required by our policy and by law to report these things."</p>
<p>During the same five-year period from 2005 to 2009, injury claims made to the WCB fell from 168 to 141.</p>
<p>The number of lost days in 2009 was 7,958, an increase of 523 from the previous year, which was largely explained by the fire department's zero tolerance for any symptoms that could be linked to the H1N1 pandemic, said McAsey. The lost days include any time firefighters are taken out of service for injury or sickness.</p>
<p>As an example, McAsey said that recently a truck unit was attending a scene when a patient coughed up blood on three firefighters. All four members of the unit were taken out of service for half a day while they went to the hospital to be seen by a physician.</p>
<p>"That probably wouldn't have been done 10 or 15 years ago . . . even five years ago," said McAsey.</p>
<p>The annual report also shows a spike in Alberta Health Care claims processed by the fire department. While they rose from 202 in 2005 to 579 in 2008, the number tripled to 1,894 last year.</p>
<p>The general increases since 2005 are attributed to the fire department's wellness centre, which was opened that year in Midnapore. The lower floor is dedicated to physical training for new recruits and the upstairs for diagnostic services and training for existing firefighters.</p>
<p>McAsey said the department had found that about 30 per cent of firefighters and their families didn't have a physician. When the centre added a family doctor, the number of health-care claims processed through the centre spiked.</p>
<p>"With our doctors there, we have cases where we've caught a lot of ailments early like cancers and heart conditions that would've gone undetected," said McAsey.</p>
<p>Calgary Firefighters Association president Mark Faires, who has been critical of the department on staffing levels, said the wellness centre has been the best contribution he's seen to improving the overall health of firefighters in the city.</p>
<p>"Not so long ago, the attitude if you got sick was buck up and get to work," he said.</p>

<p>As we pulled into a parking lot the other day, Ari, 15, and I noticed a trend. The spots with handicapped markers had been extended.</p>
<p>"They've, like, doubled them," he noted.</p>
<p>"With an aging population, we're going to be seeing more things like this," I explained.</p>
<p>"Oh. You mean Baby Boomers. Who are old," he replied.</p>
<p>"Hey! By some counts, I'm a Baby Boomer, buddy. I was born in the last year, 1964."</p>
<p>"Yeah. Old people."</p>
<p>"Be quiet. And remember, I'm really only 34."</p>
<p>Last Christmas I asked for, and received, a Wii Fit. This is a video workout that I thought I could adhere to. I could do it in the privacy of my home, wearing ugly comfortable clothes, and nobody would have to know. My sister Gilly had been using it for months and loved it. I commented last fall how great she looked.</p>
<p>"You got that butt with Wii Fit?" I asked her.</p>
<p>"Yup. Well, that and the swine flu," she replied.</p>
<p>We finally got it set up a few days ago. I'm not one to rush into things, obviously. I have been calling it Wii Sweat, which nobody but me finds funny. Ari has patiently explained that until I actually do it, I'm not sweating.</p>
<p>You have to go through a setting-up process, where you answer questions. As I was concentrating on not falling off the little platform, Ari worked the hand thing to answer questions. You select a figure to represent you.</p>
<p>I started to debate whether my figure should be wearing her glasses or not. Ari sighed, and told me it really didn't matter.</p>
<p>You put in your height and age. You go through a series of exercises to determine your balance. With Ari giggling like an idiot on the couch, I carefully made my way through. At the end, the system told me I was 34 in Wii Fit years. I screamed. Ari jumped.</p>
<p>"I'm only 34!"</p>
<p>"It can't see you. You're not 34," he replied. "Move over."</p>
<p>Ari went through the set-up process himself, determined to prove that Wii Fit wasn't my brilliant new best friend. We waited together while it processed his information. In Wii Fit years, my 15-year-old son was ... 15.</p>
<p>"See?" he said. "If you're 34, I should be about 6. It's busted."</p>
<p>Two days later, Ari asked if I'd worked out yet. I hadn't. I was waiting for the right time.</p>
<p>I like to work in the mornings, it was too hot in the afternoons, and at night somebody might like to sit on the couch to watch TV. And drink wine.</p>
<p>"You're just going to tell everyone you're 34 in Wii years and never work out, aren't you?" he asked.</p>
<p>Now, I hadn't said as much to him, but this is exactly what I had planned to do.</p>
<p>"Of course not! I'll start tomorrow."</p>
<p>I was talking to my friend Janie, who is a couple of years older than I am. Tall and slender and in terrific shape, she does yoga and all manner of sporty things. I told her I was going to start Wii Fitting.</p>
<p>"Oh, I have one of those," she said.</p>
<p>"I'm 34," I said smugly.</p>
<p>"It said I'm 58." I processed this information. "I just skip past that part. It's a pretty fun workout, even if it lies," she concluded.</p>
<p>I am starting today. But I will not be skipping past that first part. Thirty four is the nicest thing I've been called in ages.</p>

<p>To city dwellers, towering feed silos are as much a part of farm imagery as Old MacDonald. But to farmers, those towers are often called something else. Tombstones.</p>
<p>To city dwellers, towering feed silos are as much a part of farm imagery as Old MacDonald. But to farmers, those towers are often called something else.</p>
<p>Tombstones.</p>
<p>To them, those empty silos are relics of another era: before farming's decade of crisis, before the high Canadian dollar slashed farm incomes, before the flood of cheap meat imports into Canadian grocery stores.</p>
<p>These "tombstones" are a tangible sign that two of our region's most valuable agricultural groups, beef and pig farmers - so dependent on the U.S. market - are simply getting out of the business.</p>
<p>"We used to have a dozen beef farmers here in North Dumfries, and all those guys are empty and their silos are sitting empty, too," says Jeff Stager, a Roseville-area farmer and former president of the Waterloo Federation of Agriculture. "If you're not making money at something, you've got to quit doing it."</p>
<p>The trend is pronounced here, but it's also provincewide:</p>
<p>Ontario farms are sending fewer and fewer beef cattle to provincially inspected processing plants. They sent 132,751 cows to slaughter last year, down from 189,806 in 2004.</p>
<p>The province's total cattle population (including dairy cows) shrunk to 1.7 million animals in January - about 650,000 fewer cows than Ontario farms had in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean that Ontario's grocery stores face a shortage of beef - far from it. Consumers have access to a buffet of cheap beef often imported from the U.S. or South America, though they don't usually realize its origin.</p>
<p>Waterloo Region also continues to lose pig farms, part of a provincewide decline that has been going on for years.</p>
<p>Ontario's sow heard is down about 25 per cent - or 109,000 animals - from what it was in April 2004, according to Ontario Pork.</p>
<p>Processing plants are shutting down, too, forcing livestock farmers to send their animals even farther afield.</p>
<p>Many farmers have simply sold off their herds and switched to growing corn and other crops, a less lucrative but less risky venture.</p>
<p>If you're a beef or pig farmer, these are bad times - with one notable exception.</p>
<p>The region's Old Order Mennonite farms, which account for about half of Waterloo Region's 1,440 farms, have been largely insulated from this downward trend.</p>
<p>That's because they farm in the old-fashioned, diversified style smaller plots with a mix of cows, pigs, chickens, vegetable gardens and crops.</p>
<p>They own their equipment communally and live frugally, which allows them to ride out difficult years in ways modern, specialized farms can't.</p>
<p>That's great, but it's not realistic for the modern farmer, Stager said.</p>
<p>"Those guys are in a time warp," Stager said.</p>
<p>"They've got small family farms where they do everything. They're farming in the traditional way people learned about in their Grade 3 readers."</p>
<p>The decline in beef and pig farming may be going unnoticed by consumers, but it's a well-known story to farmers.</p>
<p>"You can't continue to lose</p>
<p>$30 a hog as we did for three years. People said, Enough is enough,' " said Stewart Cressman, who raises cattle and hogs on his 900-acre Wilmot Township farm.</p>
<p>Cressman's family has been raising beef in the New Dundee area since arriving from Pennsylvania with this region's first wave of settlers two centuries ago. But that tradition will end with him.</p>
<p>"My sons won't be in the cattle business because it's too risky for them. Maybe I've hung on too long," he said.</p>
<p>Unlike grain crops, which can be stored until the price improves, livestock need to be sold when they're market-ready. But a bad exchange rate can cut hundreds of dollars off the price of a cow.</p>
<p>Some, like Cressman, have been toughing it out by remortgaging their farms to cover their bills, hoping that prices will improve. But something's got to give.</p>
<p>"It's not a long-term solution. The idea is that down the road, there'll be a better day," Cressman said. "It's a short-term decision, and what it does is dig the hole deeper."</p>
<p>Unlike the corn belt of southwestern Ontario or the fruit and vegetable-rich Niagara region, farmers in Waterloo Region are still primarily raisers of livestock, and have been since farming began here with the early German pioneers.</p>
<p>Here's how it breaks down:</p>
<p>Cattle farms are the biggest sector, accounting for almost</p>
<p>$93 million in revenue in 2008.</p>
<p>Sales of hogs were worth about $37.6 million to the region's farmers that same year.</p>
<p>Dairy and poultry farms, which unlike beef and pork operations enjoy the stability of supply management programs, took in revenues of $80 million and</p>
<p>$50 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Corn, by comparison, is worth about $16 million to the region's farmers.</p>
<p>But more local beef and pig farmers are calling it quits after years of disease outbreaks, stiffening regulation, closed borders, rising fertilizer and fuel costs, and an inflating dollar have decimated their incomes.</p>
<p>For farmers who rely heavily on exporting their animals, it's been one crisis after another, according to Bette Jean Crews, president of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture.</p>
<p>"This has been a perfect storm," Crews said.</p>
<p>"Everything came at the same time. These are what we call a 50-year crisis, and we've had more of them in the last decade than ever before in our history."</p>
<p>This year alone, Ontario farmers cut their sow herds by</p>
<p>17,400 between January and April.</p>
<p>"People stopped eating pork because they thought they could get swine flu. We lost a lot of our export markets because of it," Crews said.</p>
<p>"And we're still feeling it. We're losing pork farms all the time."</p>
<p>Because Canadians demand the cheapest food possible - we spend about 10 per cent of our income on what we eat, compared to Europeans' 30 per cent - farmers live and die by the slimmest of margins, she said.</p>
<p>To survive this downturn, farmers have been living off their equity by remortgaging their properties.</p>
<p>They are holding off on buying new equipment and fixing up their buildings.</p>
<p>Many are relying on second jobs to supplement their income. They've also been kept afloat by government insurance programs designed to get them through lean years.</p>
<p>Farmers are trying to produce as cheaply as possible to compete with bargained-priced imports from places like China. And they're competing with countries with softer regulations - like the U.S. - where looser rules mean that farmers can get more meat off their animals, and dump it at a lower cost on the Canadian market.</p>
<p>All these pressures are making farming a tough place to make a buck right now, Crews said.</p>
<p>With all the risks, long hours and little guarantee of a steady income, no wonder so few young people are choosing a career in farming, Crews said. The average age of an Ontario farmer is now between 58 and 60.</p>
<p>"If there's no profit in a business, who's going to get into it?" she said. "Who in their right mind would get into something that you can't pencil it out?</p>
<p>Compared to a steady wage at, say, the Toyota plant in Cambridge, most high school graduates aren't likely to get into a business that may take a decade or more before it starts producing dividends, Stager said.</p>
<p>Some farmers are optimistic that things can turn around, however.</p>
<p>The agricultural federation thinks if regulators cut red tape and make it easier for processing facilities to operate, it would take some pressure off farms. They look to incentive programs to draw young people into farming. And the beef industry has had some success restructuring to reduce costs and find a way to make a profit.</p>
<p>"I think there is some hope there," Crews said.</p>
<p>"Now, when you publicize that, the beef farmer who is not seeing any light at the end of the tunnel is going to say, I don't see any hope.'"</p>

</p>
<p>‘We are on the leading edge of a true revolution in medicine,” Francis Collins, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, says in his new book, The Language of Life: DNA and the Revolution in Personalized Medicine – “one that promises to transform the traditional ‘one size fits all' approach into a much more powerful strategy that considers each individual as unique and as having special characteristics that should guide an approach to staying healthy. But you have to be ready to embrace this new world.”</p>
<p>This seismic shift toward genetic personalized medicine promises to give each of us insight into our deepest personal identity – our genetic selves – and let us sip the elixir of life in the form of individually tailored testing and drugs. But can we really believe these promises?</p>
<p>Genetic personalized medicine isn't the only important new development. Commercial ventures such as private blood banks play up the uniqueness of your baby's umbilical-cord blood. Enhancement technologies such as deep-brain stimulation – “Botox for the brain” – promote the idea that you have a duty to be the best “me” possible. In fact, modern biotechnology is increasingly about “me” medicine, the “brand” being individual patients' supposed distinctiveness.</p>
<p>But all these technologies remain more hype than reality – and sometimes dangerous hype. Personalized genetic testing is now under investigation by the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for misleading customers into thinking we know much more than we actually do about the link between particular genes and the probability of developing particular illnesses.</p>
<p>Likewise, privately banked cord blood has been shown to be clinically less effective than publicly banked and pooled blood, leading to two skeptical reports from leading obstetricians' associations warning against its routine collection at childbirth. And enhancement technologies, supposedly enabling us to become “trans-human,” have attracted much publicity but remain largely speculative.</p>
<p>Credit for the greatest advances in human health and longevity over the past two centuries should go to “we” medicine, not “me” medicine. Public health and sanitation programs, polio and smallpox vaccinations, and tuberculosis screening in schools and workplaces have contributed the most to improved health in the Western world and beyond.</p>
<p>But when parents buy into scares linking childhood vaccines to autism, when media pundits scoff at public health measures to prevent swine flu from spreading, or when a British researcher claims that “the scourge of aging is worse than smallpox,” vaccination, epidemic prevention and screening fall by the wayside. Conversely, there's an unchallenged and unthinking preference for “me” medicine, partly because it pushes all the right buttons in our psyches, the ones marked “choice,” “individuality” and “special.”</p>
<p>The new biomedicine was originally funded and promoted as a public health initiative that would benefit all of us. Hopes for widespread cures were high when the Human Genome Project – financed by a private medical charity, a British research council and the U.S. National Institutes of Health – was completed 10 years ago. Instead, one-fifth of the human genome is now subject to private patents, meaning that patients can't afford tests for genes that cause cancer and researchers can't make progress if another team owns the patents on the genes they want to study.</p>
<p>What went wrong? Part of the answer has to do with the genetic mystique – the notion that I'm simply my genes, and that's why I'm unique. The genetic mystique plays on the individualism of Western culture and seems to give it a scientific basis. There are also powerful commercial interests at stake, meaning that research frequently concentrates on genetic links to diseases whose diagnosis and treatment will produce the greatest profit, rather than the greatest reduction in global mortality.</p>
<p>Some genetically personalized treatments may well be signs of progress, such as pharmacogenetics, which promises drug regimes tailored to the patient's own genome. If this new technology works, it could lessen the direst side effects of chemotherapy for cancer care; oncologists would no longer have to prescribe “one size fits all” regimes if patients who are genetically more receptive to the drug could be differentiated and given lighter regimes.</p>
<p>But the high cost of developing new drugs means that pharmaceutical companies need substantial patient markets to make their investments profitable. Will minority ethnic groups miss out?</p>
<p>For a while, it looked as if the reverse would happen, with niche markets in pharmacogenetics targeting ethnic minorities. Race-based medicine hit the scene in 2005 when the FDA approved BiDil, the first drug to treat a specific racial group: black Americans suffering from heart failure. But there was no real clinical evidence that the drug worked better, and it's been withdrawn from the market.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, major advances such as the Human Genome Project have certainly geneticized medicine: There's a growing popular tendency to define all conditions as genetically determined. And that means that public health measures are likely to be neglected in favour of individual genetic scans or personalized genetic-testing services. Genetic tests, if properly administered, can save lives, but they also tend to create a feeling that the responsibility for your health rests with you, the individual patient.</p>
<p>The genetic mystique, the legally doubtful view that we own our bodies, and the widening reach of the market in our lives lead many to believe that “me” medicine is the only game in town. When health care is paid for by individuals or their employers, “me” medicine becomes a natural outlook.</p>
<p>But, like the drunk who looks for his lost keys only under the streetlight, biomedicine is in danger of concentrating only where the glare is brightest – not on the most effective health interventions but on the most personalized and profitable, which nowadays go hand in hand.</p>

</p>
<p>"Power consists in one's capacity to link his will</p>
<p>with the purpose of others, to lead by reason and a gift of co-operation."</p>
<p>-- Woodrow Wilson</p>
<p>11From schoolyards to boardrooms, high school cliques to political party caucuses, we are drawn to individuals who, for one reason or another, influence us.</p>
<p>We hear what they have to say, we trust their opinions, heed their advice. Some of us think perhaps one day we could be them.</p>
<p>People in powerful positions make the decisions that guide our world, sometimes for the good, sometimes not.</p>
<p>The 30 Manitobans on our list have, in their own way, shaped our world, influenced our lives, moved us to act or obey or follow.</p>
<p>But what makes them powerful? Is it that any of us would immediately return their call? Is it that they command respect? Is it that they make things happen?</p>
<p>It depends on who you ask and who the particular power broker is.</p>
<p>"Power is a highly subjective idea," said University of Winnipeg political scientist Shannon Sampert.</p>
<p>Even Spiderman knew with power came great responsibility. Often, with great responsibility comes power. Hence the reason the premier of Manitoba will always be among the top 30 most powerful people in the province.</p>
<p>But how much power great responsibility yields is differentiated by the individual.</p>
<p>Sampert notes the current premier, Greg Selinger, wields his power in a far different way than Gary Doer ever did.</p>
<p>Doer had that political glossy star quality most politicians would love to be able to buy in a bottle. Selinger has more of a matte finish, more chess club than football captain.</p>
<p>"He's the understated quiet type," said Sampert.</p>
<p>That style may be one of the reasons Selinger is not on top of this year's list, while Doer was in its previous three versions. There are other subtle differences. Doer earned power by leading a party to an electoral win. Selinger won over his own party but hasn't yet asked the entire province for a mandate.</p>
<p>Selinger may not be flashy, but he is still among the front-line power brokers, the ones most people in the province would recognize on the street.</p>
<p>There are also the backroom wheelers and dealers, the so-called puppet masters who pull strings and influence those like Selinger, but often without many people really knowing who they are.</p>
<p>Power evolves over time.</p>
<p>While the following list is still dominated by white men -- 20 of the 30 -- there are more women and more aboriginals than ever before (seven and four respectively).</p>
<p>It's a sign not only of the growing number of non-traditional power brokers, but a sign those of us charged with watching them are more aware of their existence.</p>
<p>It's easy to figure out who the powerful are in the traditional places -- the legislature, city hall, the business community. But Manitoba is more than just provincial politics and money-making. This list attempts to reflect that as well.</p>
<p>Despite huge gains for women in the last century, there's still a gender gap when it comes to power positions. There are fewer women CEOs, fewer women politicians, and since those are the two identities which make up the majority of the list, it should not be surprising fewer women than men make the list.</p>
<p>That isn't to say there are not other powerful women in Manitoba, just that they aren't necessarily among the 30 most powerful people in the province. Yet.</p>
<p>Sampert notes power is still a somewhat masculine term that often confers the traits of being powerful as positive if you are a man but negative if you are a woman.</p>
<p>The evolution of power also means it is no longer the sole possession of the elite. Where once power was conferred often by bloodlines, and still can be through money lines, it is not impossible now for the serf to become the landowner. Sampert notes a lot of it depends on social abilities.</p>
<p>"Power is often about the ability to make social connections," she said. "It's about your social intelligence."</p>
<p>The big test, often, for people in powerful positions, is how they wield that power once they have it.</p>
<p>Robert F. Kennedy said "the problem of power is how to achieve its responsible use rather than its irresponsible and indulgent use -- of how to get men of power to live for the public rather than off the public."</p>
<p>That then becomes the question of staying power. Little can get you kicked out of the power club faster than misusing the power you're given.</p>
<p>Here are the 30 as chosen by a Free Press panel. A number of prominent -- and still powerful -- Manitobans didn't pass muster for this year's Power 30. Chief among them is Gary Doer. The former premier has had a change of address to go along with his new job, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., and he now lives in Washington.</p>
<p>111CHIPMAN:</p>
<p>Wondering what it takes to get to the No. 1 spot? Start with helping to run a wildly successful family business whose interests range from car dealerships to real estate to construction. Next launch a major development of north Portage that will change the face of downtown. And then to put a cherry on top of your top power ranking, come up with a game plan that has your MTS Centre poised to become the home of Canada's next NHL team.</p>
<p>Among those in Manitoba who wield power and influence, only the unassuming captain of True North Sports and Entertainment Ltd. has the ability to right the hockey wrong which saw Winnipeg lose its NHL team 15 years ago to the Arizona desert. He has had the province on side every step of the way since the building of the MTS Centre. He may walk and talk softly, but right now the hockey stick Chipman is carrying is the city's best bet to score Canada's seventh NHL franchise.</p>
<p>111ASPER</p>
<p>No question it's been an annus horribilus for the Asper family's media business. But when it comes to the Asper family's dream of building a world-class human rights museum at The Forks, Izzy's daughter keeps finding ways to make the seemingly impossible a reality.</p>
<p>Blessed with energy to burn and quick wit, Asper has what it takes to not only knock on boardroom doors -- again and again -- to raise money for the Canadian Museum for Human Rights within the province but also well beyond the province's borders.</p>
<p>If you still need convincing of Asper's pull, consider that the museum project that has been her blood, sweat and tears was good enough to attract both Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister Stephen Harper to Winnipeg in July for the unveiling of its cornerstone.</p>
<p>Toss in her ongoing support for the arts, and this woman who has been awarded both the Order of Canada and Order of Manitoba is a lock again for our No. 2 spot.</p>
<p>111Axworthy</p>
<p>Life atop the University of Winnipeg's ivory tower could have been the cushy bookend to a life of public service for the long-time Liberal heavyweight. You know, attend a few inter-departmental meetings. Drinks at the faculty club. Hand out a few degrees in the spring and fall. Instead, Axworthy has redefined the role of university president, turning the U of W campus into a springboard not only for redeveloping swaths of downtown, but also for addressing a wide range of pressing social challenges facing the city and province, especially those affecting aboriginal youth. Under his watch, his alma mater is getting new buildings, new disciplines and new direction. During his years in Ottawa as cabinet minister, Axworthy played on a national and international stage. But it's his hometown that's now the big winner from his starring role at the U of W.</p>
<p>111Selinger</p>
<p>In theory at least, Selinger possesses all the power of his predecessor. He sits atop a government that continues to enjoy a healthy majority. His political team of cabinet ministers and advisers is well seasoned. And the levers of both fear and favour that a premier wields are still very much in place. But 10 months after moving from finance minister to his new job as first minister, Selinger has yet to duplicate the political magic that allowed Gary Doer to consistently top our Power 30 ranking.</p>
<p>Not only has Selinger's government slipped into deficit, it's also slipped in the polls to the point where the NDP is running neck and neck with the Tories.</p>
<p>There have been signs of Selinger's quarterbacking skills, especially in coming up with a financial game plan to make a new stadium for the Blue Bombers work. And if he can engineer another electoral touchdown for the NDP in October 2011, he'll likely be moving up our power ranking.</p>
<p>111Richardson</p>
<p>When you run a multi-billion-dollar conglomerate and oversee a family fortune valued at $2.72 billion, (according to Canadian Business magazine's annual Rich 100 list) people answer your phone calls on the first ring. The head of <span class="companylink">James Richardson & Sons Limited</span> keeps a lower profile that most of the people on our list but don't mistake that for a lack of influence. As the chair of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, he has friends in the highest places.</p>
<p>JRSL hasn't had the greatest of years -- it recently closed its private equity funds and returned more than $1 billion to investors and a merger of Richardson Partners Financial with GMP Capital took most of its financial services jobs to Ontario -- but like the New York Yankees, the Richardsons don't rebuild, they reload.</p>
<p>Richardson isn't all business, either. As the chairman of the Assiniboine Park Conservancy, he's overseeing a $180-million renovation of one of Winnipeg's most popular attractions.</p>
<p>111Katz</p>
<p>If one test of power is getting your way, then Mayor Sam Katz is passing with flying colours.</p>
<p>He wants a police helicopter. He gets it. He wants to belatedly change plans -- yet again -- on rapid transit. Done. Council gives its blessing. Even something as mundane as his musings on the mosquito spraying get traction.</p>
<p>In other words, City Hall is Katz's field of dreams. He calls the pitches, decides when to swing for the fences and determines all the political squeeze plays.</p>
<p>But is the civic agenda he completely controls going to gain approval from the one constituency he can't control -- the city's voters? Katz's last two at-bats at the ballot box were like a slow-pitch game.</p>
<p>However, former NDP MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis will be bringing some heat to the mayoral race this fall. Another home run and Katz will be even stronger. If he strikes out, there's always his Goldeyes.</p>
<p>111Sinclair</p>
<p>Currently the head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Sinclair was recently described by Manitoba Aboriginal Affairs Minister Eric Robinson as "the most influential aboriginal person in Manitoba." It's not just his role orchestrating the commission bent on bringing closure to the residential schools nightmare for thousands of aboriginals. It's his intricate knowledge of both aboriginal customs and the non-aboriginal world and his ability to bridge the gaps between. It's his lack of political bias, his experience as a judge, a lawyer, and a mentor and the deep respect he garners from almost everyone he meets. In short -- when Murray speaks, people listen.</p>
<p>111Toews</p>
<p>He is the province's senior minister representing Manitoba's interests to his government. Little, if anything, concerning the federal government, goes down in Manitoba unless Toews has signed off on it. As public safety minister, he oversees everything from border security to prisons and Canada's security intelligence agency which has him dealing with any number of critical issues from boatloads of refugees arriving on the B.C. coast to disorder in the RCMP to the billion dollar bills for the G8/G20 summit security. Toews would be higher on the list, but he doesn't always play well in the sandbox with others and has been accused of being indifferent to Manitoba projects, leaving colleagues in the Manitoba Conservative caucus to lobby for federal money for a new stadium and the human rights museum.</p>
<p>111Wowchuk</p>
<p>She was the province's long serving agriculture minister and deputy premier under Gary Doer. When Selinger took over the premier's office last year, he kept Wowchuk as deputy premier but shifted her from agriculture to his old job in finance. It was a sign of the trust and respect he had for Wowchuk, since the man who had engineered a decade of balanced budgets wasn't likely to hand over their reins to just anyone. She is the highest ranking woman in the provincial government and garners respect from farmers and the business community. She is seen as a tough but smart and savvy politician and her influence on government policy should not be undervalued.</p>
<p>222Brennan</p>
<p>It's probably a cliché that the CEO of Manitoba's power corporation is on the Power 30 list. But this list would not be complete without the head of the province's largest Crown corporation. Last year he engineered construction of the now world renowned green office tower on Portage Avenue and the move of more than 1,300 employees into it. Now his focus must be the new transmission line. A political football in the legislature, the new line is critical to Hydro and Manitoba and Brennan must figure out how to get it done amid the non-stop bickering on Broadway about where to build it.</p>
<p>222McCaskill</p>
<p>In a town where which has more than its fair share of crime, it pays to have a powerful person wearing the top cop's badge.</p>
<p>McCaskill's been police chief for less than three years but has already demonstrated that he can not only handle the law and order part of the job but also its politics. On more than one occasion he's been a forceful advocate in dealings with the province for items like a funding for a police helicopter or cadets. Plus the WPS he now oversees is packing more firepower thanks to its tactical response unit.</p>
<p>The WPS has even taken a style point or two from its chief, having just unveiled retro-look black and white cruisers from a policing era when McCaskill's pompadour was in vogue.</p>
<p>222Asper</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the eldest Asper sibling would have made this list based purely on his executive role at <span class="companylink">Canwest Global Communications</span>. But even with its demise earlier this year, Asper remains a significant player -- or hopes to -- with his pending purchase of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. His proposal includes the construction of a new 33,000-seat stadium at the University of Manitoba and high-end retail development, The Elms, to be built on the site of the current football facility near Polo Park Shopping Centre.</p>
<p>He is also an assistant professor of law at the University of Manitoba and executive chairman of Creswin Properties Inc, the family's real estate division.</p>
<p>The Aspers weren't successful in their bid to pick up Canwest's newspaper division earlier this year but their name still carries a lot of clout in this town. Anybody who writes them off as yesterday's news does so at their own peril.</p>
<p>222Evans</p>
<p>As the Grand Chief of the Manitoba Assembly of Chiefs, Evans is the political face for aboriginals in Manitoba. He is part of all negotiations and discussions regarding aboriginal issues at both the provincial and federal level, including the recent announcement of over $100 million to improve child welfare services on reserves. He is also at the helm of a plan to try to bring electoral reform on reserves -- something sorely needed to give band councils the credibility and accountability their communities deserve. His plan got the attention and approval of former Indian Affairs Minister Chuck Strahl and is also being looked at in other regions including Atlantic Canada. His influence would likely stretch further if there were a Liberal government in power federally -- Evans is a former Liberal candidate who still has close ties to the party.</p>
<p>222Wilgosh</p>
<p>She's still in her first year as boss of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority but Wilgosh is anything but a rookie. The former nurse comes to the high-pressure post from the provincial civil service where she earned a whack of respect as the deputy health minister.</p>
<p>While she's no longer second-in-command of the province's health care system, the WRHA ship she's now in charge of steering is no small pleasure craft. To put her influence in perspective, bear in mind that the WRHA's operating budget is more than twice as large as that of the City of Winnipeg.</p>
<p>222McLeod</p>
<p>As the head of Manitoba's largest aboriginal-owned company, the Tribal Councils Investment Group, McLeod is a key bridge between the province's business community and the fast-growing, but economically depressed, First Nations.</p>
<p>TCIG is about as diversified an operation as you'll find anywhere with holdings in banking, trucking, real estate, golf courses, gasoline, airlines, healthcare, soft drinks, snack food and restaurants.</p>
<p>If you doubt that the private-held company is successful, look no further than the corporate jet it bought earlier this year from Canwest.</p>
<p>McLeod has spoken publicly about TCIG being the catalyst to prosperity for the province's First Nations people but this project will have no short cuts. The more successful TCIG becomes, the more its owners, seven Manitoba tribal councils representing 55 First Nations and more than 100,000 people, will benefit.</p>
<p>222Plett</p>
<p>The one-time plumbing supply company owner in Landmark, Man, Plett went from the geographical centre of Canada to its political centre. He was appointed to the Senate last year after years of behind the scenes work, running campaigns and as the president first of the Canadian Alliance and then of the Conservative Party. If Stephen Harper was the front man for the Conservative Party merger, Plett was the backroom wheeler dealer who went from riding to riding selling it to the grass roots. It has earned him a plethora of connections and a lot of respect both within Manitoba and outside of it. He has the ears of Manitoba's senior minister and the prime minister, and is a combination of problem solver and policy salesman. Although Plett himself will tell you his political leanings land somewhere to "the right of Attila the Hun", he is not just a Conservative government patsy carrying out a patronage appointment like a good little boy. He takes his job as senator seriously and in return, people in Ottawa take him seriously.</p>
<p>222Albo</p>
<p>From her office at Winnipeg's landmark hotel, the Fort Garry Hotel, Spa and Conference Centre, Albo regularly plays host to the elite of Winnipeg and beyond. But she does much more than run the city's iconic landmark, where $1 million was spent to renovate more than 35,000 square feet of banquet and meeting space last year.</p>
<p>She was one of the brains behind the Plaza skateboard park at the Forks, which was named one of the sport's top North American destinations by that X-Games favourite, the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>She is also actively involved at <span class="companylink">CentreVenture Development Corp</span>., where she spearheads a group of prominent Winnipeggers in identifying and creating new public destinations in our downtown through private-public partnerships.</p>
<p>222Soubry</p>
<p>After two decades at or near the top of StandardAero, Manitoba's biggest aerospace company, Soubry continues to make his mark in the province's transportation field as the CEO of <span class="companylink">New Flyer Industries</span>. Just two years into his new role, the company announced record-high revenues of more than $1 billion and aggressive plans to explore new markets. High-powered contacts? How about the man who's one heartbeat away from the most powerful office in the world? In the spring of 2009, Soubry hosted Joe Biden at the company's St. Cloud, Minn. plant, part of the U.S. vice-president's cross-country tour promoting the government's $787-million (US) stimulus package to bring the economy out of recession.</p>
<p>His powers of persuasion are meeting a stiff test these days as he tries to persuade Mayor Sam Katz of the benefits of using buses rather than light rail for rapid transit.</p>
<p>222Janice Filmon</p>
<p>They were the province's power couple when the Tories were in power from 1988-1999.</p>
<p>But while their star power has dimmed somewhat in the past decade, the Filmons are still a force to be reckoned with. He not only oversees the country's spy agency in his role as chairman of the Security and Intelligence Review Committee, but also serves on a number of corporate boards. She's active in the community on a number of fronts and was chairwoman of the Nellie McClung Foundation which fought hard to erect a statue of the suffragette and the rest of the Famous Five on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislative Building.</p>
<p>222Gray</p>
<p>If CentrePort Canada's ambitious dream is able to take off at the airport, it will largely be because of its founding president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>The mission facing Gray is a daunting one, trying to launch not only Canada's first inland port but also its first foreign free trade zone. But the former senior provincial mandarin brings to the job impeccable political and trade credentials which not only serve her well in Ottawa and Washington but also in overseas markets that CentrePort is targeting.</p>
<p>222Vogt</p>
<p>As the province's top bureaucrat, Vogt has the unenviable role of bridging the political will of cabinet and the bureaucratic abilities of the civil service. Many in his role walk tall and rule with a big stick. Vogt prefers the soft-spoken, light-hearted approach and it has served him well. He has a long history with the NDP first as Gary Doer's research director when Doer was opposition leader in the 1990s, then as Doer's principal policy adviser after the NDP formed government. In 2005, he was appointed to his current role. Some wondered whether Doer's guy would weather the change to a new premier but he did it easily and as a result helped keep the government running smoothly throughout the transition process.</p>
<p>222Robinson</p>
<p>It often seems as if Robinson knows every single aboriginal person in the province. Personally. He is a take-me-as-I-am kind of guy who makes no apologies for his weaknesses and demands no largesse for his strengths. He also tends to say exactly what he thinks, a rarity in modern day politics. As the province's Aboriginal Affairs Minister, he has the reins on a critical department but garners respect beyond his own portfolio from the entire cabinet. He's also been said to be one of the easier ministers to work for.</p>
<p>222Shindleman</p>
<p>If they built it, chances are they went through the president of Shindico Realty Inc. It's hard to find a significant real estate development in Winnipeg that doesn't have Shindleman's fingerprints all over it.</p>
<p>Easily his highest-profile project on the go is filling the empty field where the Winnipeg Arena once stood, adjacent to Polo Park Shopping Centre, considered by many to be the most valuable plot of land in the city. He knows the area well as his company brought in big box heavyweights such as <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span>, Canadian Tire and Old Navy across St. James Street.</p>
<p>He's also heavily involved in keeping the <span class="companylink">Hudson Bay Co</span>. in its iconic downtown property, as he's negotiating to bring new tenants into two of its soon-to-be-empty floors.</p>
<p>222Thorsteinson</p>
<p>After carving out his niche in Winnipeg's business community with his real estate endeavours, Thorsteinson has garnered increasing attention of late for his work on human rights.</p>
<p>The CEO of two Winnipeg REITs -- Temple and Lanesborough -- and president and owner of <span class="companylink">Shelter Canadian Properties</span>, is also chairman of the museum's board of directors. The museum is expected to be THE major tourist attraction once its doors swing open in 2012.</p>
<p>As the chair of the IDEA Committee for the Associates, a group of more than 250 business leaders who support the Asper School of Business at the U of M, his BlackBerry contains the contact information of the likes of Howard Schultz, chief global strategist at <span class="companylink">Starbucks Coffee Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Onex Corp</span>'s Gerry Schwartz and his wife, Heather Reisman, CEO of Indigo Books and Music, and domestic diva Martha Stewart -- all former winners of the IDEA award.</p>
<p>222Silver</p>
<p>If you think the president of local jean maker, <span class="companylink">Western Glove Works</span>, is flying below the radar, you're probably right. But that's just how he likes it. He's the city's only mover and shaker who is far more likely to be spotted in a pair of jeans and an Indian Motorcycle T-shirt than a suit and tie. But there's no denying his influence when you consider his moonlighting gigs -- he's the chancellor of the University of Winnipeg, co-owner of the Warehouse One retail chain, co-chair of the Premier's Economic Advisory Council, a director with Destination Winnipeg and past chair of the United Way. Oh yeah, he's also co-owner of the Brandon Sun and the Winnipeg Free Press.</p>
<p>222Barnard</p>
<p>When you control knowledge, you control power, so imagine what the president and vice-chancellor of the University of Manitoba could harness with all that brain power under his watch? He has been at his post for a little more than two years now but he hasn't wasted any time getting involved off his Fort Garry campus, becoming a director with CentrePort Canada, Manitoba's inland port, and <span class="companylink">CentreVenture Development Corp</span>.</p>
<p>He is currently overseeing Project Domino, a $150-million redevelopment of the U of M, the largest and most ambitious plan in the school's more than 130-year history.</p>
<p>His greatest achievement, however, could be elevating the university's long-time bottom-feeder status in the annual Macleans' poll of post-secondary institutions.</p>
<p>222McFadyen</p>
<p>Four years in as an MLA and leader of the opposition, McFadyen can no longer be considered a political rookie. He's led his party to a sustained improvement in the polls and comes across as far more polished and confident than he used to. With a provincial election just over a year away, McFadyen is positioning his party to give the NDP a serious run for its money. Just being close in the polls alone gives him more influence and makes the government give him and any issues he raises far more attention than it would have even five years ago. It also gives him a greater ability to bring in money, something the party must do if it is to run a solid campaign next year.</p>
<p>222Boyce</p>
<p>Don't think of this civic employee as some sort of cultural bureaucrat. Instead consider Boyce as our city's concierge, advising, shepherding and tending to the needs of those filming or using Winnipeg for some special event. One day, he might be helping set up some Hollywood star in town. The next, it might be co-ordinating with Buckingham Palace for a royal visit.</p>
<p>It's unlikely there is another person in Winnipeg as well connected, politically, socially, culturally and economically as Kenny Boyce.</p>
<p>222Rempel</p>
<p>When disaster strikes, Manitobans are among the quickest in the world to get out their chequebooks or to lend their backs to the effort. Leading the philanthropic pack in the province is the Mennonite Central Committee, which is headed up Rempel, its executive director. When you consider the seemingly never-ending stream of natural disasters of late, punctuated by the earthquake in Haiti and the floods in Pakistan, mobilizing the forces of good to ward off evil gives Rempel a rare power indeed.</p>
<p>222Richardson</p>
<p>While her family is best known for its entrepreneurial exploits, the matriarch of the Richardson clan has few peers as a philanthropist and supporter of the arts. She has been the driving force behind countless fundraising drives that have raised millions of dollars for arts organizations in the province. When needed, she was more than willing to get out her own chequebook -- or that of her foundation -- to provide an extra financial boost.</p>
<p>She has been the honourary president of the Royal Winnipeg Ballet for nearly half a century.</p>
<p>She also has a wall full of awards, including the Order of Canada and the Order of Manitoba.</p>
<p>Ones to watch:</p>
<p>Shelly Glover. When Prime Minister Stephen Harper shuffled his cabinet in July the one name immediately buzzing among the pundits was Shelly Glover. He didn't add her then but she is considered to be next in line in Manitoba for a cabinet post and has been tapped by the Harper government as their law and order spokesperson. Not a shabby role in a government which builds its campaigns around getting tough on crime.</p>
<p>Steven Fletcher. He's Manitoba's junior cabinet minister tasked with implementing the Prime Minister's long-held goals to overhaul the Senate. As the country's first quadriplegic in Parliament he has become a proud role model for overcoming extreme adversity to succeed. That alone makes people listen when he speaks.</p>
<p>Jamie Wilson. Appointed in June as the treaty commissioner for Manitoba (meaning his job is to make others in Manitoba understand and respect treaties) Wilson is a rising star in Manitoba's aboriginal community. He's young, he's ambitious, he's well connected both within and outside the aboriginal community and he already has credibility as an aboriginal education director in Opaskwayak Cree Nation who helped secure long-needed federal funding to build a new school.</p>
<p>David Harper. Grand chief of the northern chiefs organization, Harper is a one-time provincial Conservative candidate who has not hesitated to be a thorn in the side of the federal Conservative government. During the H1N1 outbreak last year he put the problems on reserves in Manitoba's north onto the national radar screen. He has proven himself able to make people listen to what he has to say.</p>
<p>Jennifer Howard. The Manitoba labour minister, Howard is considered by most in the provincial NDP to be the party's future. She's young, she's smart and she's experienced both in government and community activism. Although an MLA only since 2007, her transition to cabinet was smooth thanks to years spent developing and implementing policy for Gary Doer and she has already been tapped to help build the NDP's next campaign. One insider says Howard is one of the rarities in a caucus who could step into any cabinet job and do it well.</p>
<p>A number of prominent -- and still powerful -- Manitobans didn't cut the muster for this year's Power 30. Chief among them is Gary Doer. The former premier has had a change of address to go along with his new job, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., and he now lives in Washington.</p>
<p>Here are some of the former Power 30 members and where they are today:</p>
<p>Leonard Asper: The former president and CEO of <span class="companylink">Canwest Global Communications</span> was at the helm of the one-time media giant during its glory days a decade ago and during its spiral into bankruptcy protection over the last couple of years. He is now living in Toronto and reportedly working behind the scenes on a new business venture.</p>
<p>Sandy Riley: The president and CEO of <span class="companylink">Richardson Financial Group</span> is still one of the city's power brokers but has kept a relatively low profile since the economic downturn started two years ago.</p>
<p>Charlie Spiring: The CEO of Wellington West Capital is still as well connected as they come in Winnipeg at the helm of one of the most successful independent brokerage houses in the country. He has also kept a lower profile since the fall of 2008.</p>
<p>Lawrie Pollard: The chair of Pollard Banknote continues to oversee things at the lottery ticket maker and remains one of the most respected business veterans in the city.</p>
<p>Bob Chipman: The patriarch of the auto dealership, real estate and hockey brood is no doubt sought out by his son, Mark, for his opinion on the ever-fluent process of bringing NHL hockey back to Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Ray McFeetors: The former president and CEO of Great-West Lifeco has moved over to the chairman's role at Manitoba's biggest publicly-traded company.</p>
<p>Leo Ledohowski: The president and CEO of Canad Inns continues to run Manitoba's biggest homegrown hotel chain.</p>
<p>Ross McGowan: The head of CentreVenture continues to help inject life into Winnipeg's downtown by finding new tenants to upgrade and move into derelict buildings.</p>
<p>Theresa Oswald: The province's minister of health was front and centre during the H1N1 crisis and could have been in the Top 5 if she had taken a serious crack at Doer's job.</p>
<p>Angela Mathieson: The head of the community and economic development committee of the Manitoba cabinet continues to play a major role in the province's business investments.</p>
<p>Kevin Donnelly: The man responsible for putting events on the stage at MTS Centre and butts in the seats oversees the third busiest arena in Canada and the 39th busiest in the world.</p>

<p>Re: There is no privacy for patients waiting for emergency care, Aug. 20.</p>
<p>It was very discouraging as an emergency nurse of many years like myself to read columnist Kelly Egan's complaints of his visit to the emergency department at the Civic campus of The Ottawa Hospital.</p>
<p>Although it has many problems which we all need to work to fix, I still believe we have one of the best health-care systems in the world. Blaming the staff and structure of our emergency room is unfair.</p>
<p>Privacy is a two-way street. The public has some responsibility, too. A number of times in a shift a total stranger will come behind a curtain during an exam or wander around our department looking into each room. It is common at triage for a visitor to come right into the triage area in the middle of a report from an a paramedic and ask for directions.</p>
<p>The volume in our emergency rooms has at least tripled since I started there in the 1980s, for many systemic reasons. Yes, you will overhear what should be private conversations. The limited space for an ever-growing patient volume makes this difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>As for his comment about the glass screen in front of triage. We don't like it either but I'm not sure those in other workplaces as he suggested are as much at risk as that of triage staff. Before this protector I have had patients jump over the desk at me. I have been punched, spit at and called every name in the book. Front-line health-care workers are in the top group for reported abuse in the workplace.</p>
<p>This barrier is also an important initial protection from some pretty serious communicable disease, a lesson learned from the SARS crisis. There is an ever increasing problem with active TB, not to mention "superbugs" the recent H1N1 virus, scabies, bed bugs, and what is this now coming out of India?</p>
<p>Prior to the barrier I once had a lady sit in my triage chair with a possible anthrax exposure. The barrier gives us that few minutes of protection to hopefully flag these patients before they enter the department.</p>
<p>The reality is that we are living in riskier times. We need protection for our staff, their families as well as those we care for. There are tradeoffs for everything. Rather than criticize, suggestions for solutions would be appreciated.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>GSK defends its pandemic performance; Drug-maker's CEO says Canada was well-served despite having only one H1N1 vaccine supplier</b>
</div><div>CAROLINE ALPHONSO   </div>
<div>781 words</div><div>27 August 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>L4</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

   </div>
</p>
<p>With the recent H1N1 flu pandemic in mind, Canadian health officials have launched a review of the country's vaccination strategy, with an eye on moving beyond a single supplier for pandemic vaccines.</p>
<p>The contract with GlaxoSmithKline Inc., the company with a Canadian flu vaccine plant in Ste.-Foy, Que., became a source of controversy during the height of the pandemic virus as serious issues arose with supply and delivery of the vaccine. The federal government's 10-year contract with GSK, worth about $300-million, will expire next year, and it appears that officials plan to change the vaccine supply system.</p>
<p>Paul Lucas, GSK's president and CEO, defended his company's actions in an interview Wednesday. But he also indicated that the federal government would be wise in contracting a back-up manufacturing company in the event of another pandemic.</p>
<p>Mr. Lucas answered some questions, before he led a media tour of GSK's Mississauga facility.</p>
<p>There were hiccups during the rollout of the H1N1 vaccine. The federal government kept saying GSK promised certain amounts at fixed periods of time, but the company was not delivering on schedule. What happened there?</p>
<p>The bottom line was there was a little bit of a misalignment between what was expected and what was realistic. It took us a while to clarify for people what's the actual process of getting the vaccine out the door. It's not like filling <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span>. You just don't fill the bottle, it comes out at the end of the line and you shoot it out the door. We have a very strict quality-assurance process once it comes off the line. We had a couple of glitches in the manufacturing process initially because we had never made this before. Initially, the number of doses that we could actually get off the line and get through quality-control weren't what we had wanted to get. We resolved that in a couple of weeks, and then we started flowing through fairly efficiently.</p>
<p>Was the company overambitious in its initial promises?</p>
<p>I don't think we were overambitious. In fact we delivered [the vaccine] earlier than planned and the government actually launched the program earlier than planned. To be fair, a number of provinces didn't stick with the plan. If you recall, because the vaccine wasn't going to roll out to all 33 million Canadians overnight, they had to go with a priority list. Some of the provinces didn't follow that list. And then [13-year-old Evan Frustaglio] died and the demand shot up and then that just threw everything completely out of control.</p>
<p>What would you do differently the next time around?</p>
<p>The bottleneck in production is actually the filling. It's not making the soup; it's getting it into the vial. That's really the bottleneck, because we were only able to fill based on the capacity of the plant. If we could fill more doses per week, then we could get more out the door quickly. That's the plan. If we were to get the contract, we would want to be able to fill more doses more quickly.</p>
<p>How confident are you of getting a new contract?</p>
<p>We're in the process now, and it's hard to say where that's going to go. We've shown that we did a pretty good job through all of this, and I continue to say that Canada was the first country to have enough doses for all of its population, and we had that by the end of the year. The strategy worked, but we can always do better. That's the bottom line of the whole pandemic. The problem with a pandemic is you're practising in the situation.</p>
<p>One of the criticisms of the federal government is that it went with only one vaccine manufacture and that's why Canada ran into problems. Do you think that's fair?</p>
<p>We did supply more than any other manufacturer in the world, and delivered it on a better time scale. So the actual results would say we did really well in Canada with one supplier, a domestic supplier, where we had priority access. Should there be an insurance policy of some sort? I wouldn't argue against that. I think when you're dealing with issues like H1N1 or any other crisis, it's always good to have a backup plan. This interview has been edited and condensed.</p>

<p>Re: When Conservatives trip up, Aug. 23.</p>
<p>Columnist L. Ian MacDonald's account of the Conservatives' recent woes is periodically refreshing but overall muddled. He lampoons the handling of the census changes and the $9-billion prison buildup but dismisses them as small issues.</p>
<p>He claims the Conservatives have done well on major policy and management issues, such as the stimulus package, fighting off the bank tax and limiting government spending at the G8-G20, the GM bailout and H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>I suppose MacDonald might think the $18-billion purchase of attack jet fighters is a big success, too. Our environmental do-nothingness must be one, too. No mention of the Conservatives' fear-mongering on the Tamil asylum seekers. The first two are major issues but they are definitely not successes. And who cares whether or not there's a small transaction on a handful of Canadian banks and other financial institutions? How did "Canada" win? It was a good idea, not just to raise the money for the next crisis, but as a window on their secret world.</p>
<p>MacDonald fails to support his conclusion that Stephen Harper's government does well on management issues. His best lines about policy that is made up on the fly don't speak well of Harper's management. Nor do the dozen noisy departures of senior bureaucrats and others in the last few years.</p>
<p>Harper's team of pitbull and poodle ministers are well-managed, to be sure. No doubt MacDonald would agree that toeing the government line right down to talking points is a success, too.</p>

</p>
<p>The Conservative government wins generally high marks from Canadians for competence on big files, but has created a significant trust deficit over small issues like the census.</p>
<p>Competence and trust are the two main attributes that frame voting intention. While competence is ultimately the more important question on the ballot, trust is also important to any party and its leader in closing the deal with voters.</p>
<p>One of the nagging questions about Stephen Harper and his government is why they consistently do well on major policy and management issues, while screwing up on small stuff.</p>
<p>The answer is that they're very good at process, but occasionally allow their fascination with tactics to get the better of them. When they lose sight of the big picture and get hung up on wedge issues, that's when they get in trouble.</p>
<p>There isn't an important file that hasn't been well run in the last year -- from the GM bailout to the H1N1 vaccine distribution, from the Haitian relief effort to moving $40 billion of stimulus money out the door.</p>
<p>The single most important event of the year is the budget, and Jim Flaherty's last two budgets have steered the country safely through a scary recession to recovery.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the security costs and riots that became the story of the G8 and G20 summits, Harper's knowledge of the complex economic and financial files was impressive. And as host, he got what Canada wanted out of both meetings -- no global bank tax and a commitment to cut deficits in half by 2013, with a return to balance by 2016, a path Canada is already on.</p>
<p>The same prime minister who looks very comfortable on the world stage is then hobbled at home by an issue as inconsequential as whether a long-form mandatory census questionnaire should be replaced by a voluntary one, with a sample size half again as large. Oh, and by the way, the larger voluntary sample -- three homes in 10 rather than one in five on the mandatory form -- will cost another $35 million.</p>
<p>Part of the Conservative brand equity is that they are seen as sound stewards of taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>The rationale for this, protecting the privacy of Canadians from intrusive questions such as how many bedrooms they had in their house, collapsed when the head of Statistics Canada resigned over the replacement of the mandatory form.</p>
<p>And where was the PM when this summer storm was breaking?</p>
<p>On vacation and off the air for three weeks. And where, for that matter, was Industry Minister Tony Clement in the middle of all this? At an air show in Britain.</p>
<p>Great communications management.</p>
<p>When Clement got home, he twittered that no one in his riding was asking about the census.</p>
<p>He's not wrong about that, but what is a senior minister doing on Twitter?</p>
<p>When Clement finally blinked on the census a week ago Wednesday, it was because French-language minorities had taken the government to the Federal Court, which was only too happy to hear it.</p>
<p>If there's anyone who wants to be accurately counted, it's francophones outside Quebec. A lot depends on it, including federal funding.</p>
<p>Clement's proffered compromise is to move two questions on languages in the home from the voluntary long-form to the mandatory short-form questionnaire. While he was at it, he announced the government would drop the threat of jail time for people refusing to answer the census.</p>
<p>If you think they're making this up as they go along, you're right.</p>
<p>This is a classic example of policy written on the back of an envelope.</p>
<p>And there's Treasury Board President Stockwell Day saying the government needs to spend $9 billion on new prisons, in spite of a falling crime rate.</p>
<p>Well, the reason, he said, was a spike in the rate of unreported crimes.</p>
<p>We are not making this up. Asked about this again, Day stuck to his story.</p>
<p>At least we won't need more prisons for people refusing to answer the long form census.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>How to heal health delivery; Ontario needs to review and reorganize the governance of the local health system</b>
</div><div>Michael M. Rachlis   </div>
<div>826 words</div><div>23 August 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>There are rising concerns about the LHINs, Ontario's Local Health Integration Networks. On Aug. 10, Ombudsman André Marin accused at least some of the 14 LHINs of counting board members' golf course and supermarket conversations toward their "community engagement" goals. In the past year several communities, including Niagara and Peterborough, have mobilized to fight planned LHIN reductions of hospital services.</p>
<p>Conservative Leader Tim Hudak has promised to dissolve the LHINs. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath more cautiously has called for a review and a moratorium on hospital restructuring.</p>
<p>At least some of the criticism of the LHINs is legitimate. However, all health systems in all jurisdictions have some regional approaches to planning. Not every town got a TB sanatorium in the 1920s or cobalt bombs for cancer in the 1940s. And the ministry strictly doles out cardiac or neurosurgery units now.</p>
<p>In 1974, Dr. Fraser Mustard's Task Force recommended the creation of district health councils and local ministry operational units. Then-premier Bill Davis only established the district health councils as voluntary planning bodies. Thirteen years later, Dr. John Evans recommended a series of integrated regional models for Ontario to consider. Over the years, premiers David Peterson, Bob Rae, Mike Harris and Ernie Eves punted these ideas. Meanwhile, every other province created regional authorities. Finally in 2006, Premier Dalton McGuinty established the 14 LHINs.</p>
<p>Of course, government policies are mainly driven by politics, not necessarily good evidence. So why bother learning the evidence? Stephen Harper and Tony Clement's cancellation of the long-form census has taken this attitude to new lows. And, partly because of this attitude, there is little rigorous evidence on the performance of the Ontario LHINs and other Canadian regional models.</p>
<p>However, it is safe to say that Ontario's approach to LHINs is unwieldy. In other provinces, regional authorities directly deliver the vast majority of home-care services with their own staff. In Ontario, there are three levels of contracts before the patient gets a bath. The LHINs contract with community care access centres for home-care services. Then the CCACs send out RFPs (request for proposals) and eventually sign contracts with various for-profit and non-profit entities. Then the home-care agency signs contracts with individual workers, most of whom are non-unionized. The Ontario high foreheads cite this "purchaser provider split" as if it were a biblical prohibition. Other provinces cite this approach as proof of Ontario's pride-goeth-before-the-fall exceptionalism.</p>
<p>The other provinces also at least had the political leadership to disestablish most of their hospital boards. The McGuinty government judged that Ontarians would resist a similar step here. However, as a result the LHINs are seen as just another administrative tier. And, partly because other corporate boards remained, the LHINs have very few expert human resources with which to fulfill their immense job descriptions.</p>
<p>Finally, the LHINs legislation doesn't mention public health and there is little coordination between public health and the rest of the health system. The province's H1N1 flu management problems last fall reflected this lack of integration.</p>
<p>Something will happen to the LHINs, probably after the next election. And, every other province has at least tinkered with their regional models.</p>
<p>Here's some advice to the government as it reviews the LHINs and the governance of Ontario's health-care system: Start with form following function. Some services, like cardiac care, cancer and emergency services need top-down command and control. Some services, like care of the frail elderly and health promotion, beg for freewheeling bottom-up, democratic, non-profit entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>In B.C., the provincial health services agency coordinates eight specialized agencies, including the B.C. Centre for Disease Control. Cancer Care Ontario plays a similar role for oncology services and could be a model for a provincial health agency in this province.</p>
<p>Ontario's 80 community health centres are governed by elected community boards and typically engage hundreds of their residents every year. And that's not counting chats in line at Tims!</p>
<p>Quebec's 95 local health boards and England's 151 Primary Care Trusts are much closer to their communities than Ontario's 14 LHINs. Ontario should consider establishing democratic control at the local primary health-care level, where most health is delivered.</p>
<p>Finally, regional level governance could be established building on local primary health-care boards.</p>
<p>The LHINs have been a baby step to better integration. Ontario should review its regional model and then reorganize the governance of the health system to balance efficiency, effectiveness and community participation.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Rachlis is a health policy analyst and an associate professor at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>On Aug. 10, Ontario Ombudsman André Marin said the Hamilton-Niagara local health integration network (LHIN) held clandestine or illegal meetings.

<div id="hd"><b>School board cuts retirees; 400 substitute teachers told to stay home</b>
</div><div>Sarah McGinis   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>636 words</div><div>21 August 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>I t's in with the new and out with the old -- teachers that is, when classes resume Sept. 2 in public schools after some 400 retired educators were told they're no longer needed as substitutes.</p>
<p>After years of coping with substitute teacher shortages, the Calgary Board of Education has found itself with too many for the work that can be provided, said spokesman Ted Flitton.</p>
<p>In late July, letters went out to all retired teachers informing them they will no longer be included on the district's active substitute teaching list.</p>
<p>"It's not an easy decision. They bring so much and have given so much to our schools and students . . . . They come into classrooms at moment's notice, and transition is seemingly seamless. But we need to be strategic," said Flitton.</p>
<p>"We have to be fair to people and give some assurance they will be able to earn a living when on the substitute roster."</p>
<p>The CBE tends to have between 800 and 1,000 teachers on its active substitute teaching roster each year to help cover teacher absences due to illness or professional development, said Flitton.</p>
<p>Last year, the substitute list was "considerably larger than in the past," likely to help prepare for H1N1 influenza, said Calgary Public Teachers' Association president Jenny Regal.</p>
<p>But the onslaught of sick days caused by the flu pandemic didn't come.</p>
<p>And professional development for staff was also increasingly incorporated into the work day with school-based projects.</p>
<p>As a result there were more substitute teachers than ever before vying for a smaller pool of work, creating financial strains for many.</p>
<p>"It's a very difficult situation. Your heart just breaks for them," said Regal.</p>
<p>"We heard stories from teachers who had their benefit premiums deducted from their bank account because their paycheque was not big enough to cover it.</p>
<p>"The school board did have to do something," she said.</p>
<p>Faced with the prospect of around 1,600 substitute teachers for this coming school year -- double what is generally needed -- the public school board has decided to cull hundreds of names from its substitute teaching ranks before classes resume, said Flitton.</p>
<p>It has chosen to remove retired teachers in hopes of retaining younger substitutes who could become full-time teachers for the board in future, said Flitton.</p>
<p>"We need to be forward thinking. We need to develop those substitute teachers who are starting our career and want to build a career with us," he said.</p>
<p>But removing all retired</p>
<p>teachers from substitute positions created concerns over a loss of experienced instructors -- especially those who teach specialized courses which are hard to fill such as high school math, career and technology studies or language programs.</p>
<p>Many retired teachers, especially women who have taken time off to start their families, use substitute work to supplement their pensions, said Regal.</p>
<p>The CBE's daily substitute teaching rate is approximately $187 per day.</p>
<p>"We are working on solutions. I've had a productive conversation with those in charge of this particular part of teacher staffing and have become aware that solutions are possible on a limited basis," Regal said.</p>
<p>Substitute teachers with specialized skills, or those extenuating reasons for having worked little last year, can reapply to be put back on the substitute teaching list and they will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. And some retired teachers have been returned to the substitute list.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Flitton said the changes are really an effort to ensure that prospective future full-time teachers who are committed to maintaining a working relationship with the district don't get frustrated by limited temporary work and leave.</p>

<p>Despite it being the soggiest Calgary summer in memory, Kam Kvern has had to cancel his outdoor fitness class only twice.</p>
<p>"We called it off because the thunderstorms rolled in," says Kvern, owner of Neighbourhood Boot-Camp, a company that guides participants through their paces at various outdoor locations in the city. "But other than that, we push on no matter what the weather's like."</p>
<p>Over the Thursday lunch hour, a half-dozen or so of Kvern's clients are doing the drills at Sien Lok Park at the edge of Chinatown.</p>
<p>It isn't raining, but the atmosphere is definitely different, as a haze of smoke hovers over our heads.</p>
<p>"I noticed a bit of a burning smell," says boot camp participant Jen Taylor after doing a set of pushups, "but it's not affecting me at all."</p>
<p>For his part, Kvern notices the haze only when I tell him, in between rubbing my watery eyes, that a strong wind has blown the B.C. forest fire smoke our way.</p>
<p>"I had no idea," he says, when I fill him in on the provincial government's warning that even healthy people should refrain from strenuous physical exertion in the great outdoors.</p>
<p>"That's kind of funny," says Kvern, agreeing with me that boot camp-style callisthenics definitely fall into the "strenuous" category.</p>
<p>While Kvern may be guilty of being less than observant, he's not alone in ignoring the changing winds.</p>
<p>Over the hour-long workout, he and his sweating clients are joined by a parade of in-line skaters, joggers and walkers on the nearby promenade that winds its way along the downtown side of the Bow River.</p>
<p>Although the smoke has settled in for, depending on which way the wind continues to blow, what could be another day or five, the warnings have yet to sink in for the average downtown denizen looking for a break from the office.</p>
<p>Those who pay attention to Internet news sites, though, would know that our transformation into a city of smoke has serious implications for at least some segments of the population.</p>
<p>According to Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer, those with asthma, bronchitis or emphysema should "remain indoors, keep their windows closed and take any preventive measures their physicians have previously recommended," and anyone having difficulty breathing "should consult their physician."</p>
<p>On Thursday, organizations catering to the needs of our city's senior population were taking added precautions.</p>
<p>"We're closely monitoring the situation, and we're encouraging our clients to stay inside and keep their windows closed," says Samara Cygman, manager of communications for Carewest, which operates 10 facilities for seniors in the city. "Poor air quality is a big issue for us."</p>
<p>Dr. Joel Doctor says that if the smoke is affecting Calgarians, he wouldn't necessarily hear about it right away.</p>
<p>"They'd head to the emergency departments, not my office," says the physician who specializes in clinical immunology and allergy.</p>
<p>Still, he acknowledges that while most of the 20 per cent of the population with asthma shouldn't be too alarmed, "it can be a huge problem for those whose asthma isn't controlled, and in the very young and old."</p>
<p>Those people, he says, should indeed heed the warnings of the province's chief medical officer.</p>
<p>"Maybe spend some time at the mall this week," he says.</p>
<p>And while much office water cooler chatter on this day revolves around the campfire-like smell infiltrating our nostrils, Murray Mack knows it has yet to cause a true stir.</p>
<p>As the owner of Healthcare & Rehab Specialties, a medical and health-care supply firm, Mack is accustomed to seeing a run on his N-95 respirator-mask supply when fear hits the atmosphere.</p>
<p>"We couldn't keep up when SARS hit, and we got a little busy during the H1N1 crisis," he says, "but I haven't had a single phone call today from anyone inquiring about the masks. I think most people are just going to stay inside and wait it out."</p>
<p>Kvern says now that he understands the seriousness of the air quality warning, he'll "check out the air situation on Friday" before starting class. But doubtless, there'll be more than a few healthy Calgarians following Len Radke's plan to wait out the smoke -- outside.</p>
<p>"I walk here every day at lunch. I love being out of the office," says the tax collector as he strolls with a cup of tea down the Eau Claire promenade. "It's just smoke -- I'm not going to get in a big panic about it."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The end of the H1N1 pandemic; There are lessons to be learned from this saga</b>
</div><div>Alan Cassels   </div>
<div>Special to the Sun</div>
<div>695 words</div><div>20 August 2010</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Well, we're glad that's over. Last week the World Health Organization announced the official end of the H1N1 pandemic. Their officials shouldn't be surprised if the collective response by the world is: "Why should we believe you?"</p>
<p>The estimated death toll of the flu pandemic, sitting around 18,000 people worldwide, is tragic in itself, but far smaller than the estimated two billion that the WHO said could be affected when they announced the flu pandemic back in June 2009.</p>
<p>The credibility of the WHO, as well as governments who followed their advice, was severely tested from last year's pandemic experience. Whether you think the global community overreacted to this flu virus, it is clear there were billions of dollars expended globally on drugs and vaccines for a virus that all signs were saying was a dud.</p>
<p>Some experts have argued buying drugs and vaccines was money well spent, and pandemic plans, however flawed, poorly executed and late, were necessary to deliver the appropriate vaccines to prepare us for what could've been a killer virus. I disagree. From the day the WHO changed the definition of what qualified as a "pandemic" so that any virus with a worldwide spread would qualify, the cascade of actions and public pronouncements did little except undermine confidence in public health. After all, if you are crying wolf from the tallest pulpit in the land, you need to be absolutely sure of what you were saying -- and no word characterized the H1N1 flu pandemic better than "uncertainty."</p>
<p>The WHO's pandemic declaration set off a global domino effect as countries around the world plunged forward to ramp up their pandemic plans to counter the threat. Curiously, no country stood up to ask exactly what kind of drugs the WHO officials were taking. Maybe they were a bit too addled to have noted that H1N1 circulating in the southern hemisphere months before it hit our shores was delivering a flu season milder than normal, a fact that should have made public health authorities in the north seriously call into question the billions being spent in preparations.</p>
<p>Along the way we heard the disturbing news that key scientists who advised the World Health Organization on pandemic planning had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that were likely to profit handsomely from the guidance they gave, yet these financial conflicts of interest were not only not disclosed, but the WHO continues to refuse to disclose them.</p>
<p>This is appalling. Do we really want a world authority taking advice from experts who had declarable financial and research ties with companies selling antivirals and influenza vaccines? Earlier this year, the British Medical Journal, reporting on the financial conflicts scandal, said that their investigation revealed serious ramifications and if not addressed the "H1N1 may yet claim its biggest victim -- the credibility of the WHO and the trust in the global public health system."</p>
<p>The Canadian government bought more than 50 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine and less than half the population was vaccinated. The resultant mildness of the virus and the refusal by many people to be browbeaten into getting a shot means that there are literally tons of unused, expiring medication worth billions of dollars in stockpiles that will be thrown out.</p>
<p>Only about 40 per cent of the population of B.C. got vaccinated and we now have to throw out $20 million worth of unused H1N1 flu vaccine. At the end of the day, let's face it, the WHO's pandemic pronouncement has left us bilked: The world spent billions on medication and vaccine stockpiles because the World Health Organization cried wolf. If the WHO cannot cleanse its ties to the industrialists hungry for profits in exaggerating the severity of disease in order to sell treatments, why should we ever again listen to anything they say?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Patients unfazed by India superbug; Downplaying scare, Canadians have surgery at Indian hospitals</b>
</div><div>Rick Westhead  South Toronto Star    </div>
<div>846 words</div><div>17 August 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star    </div>
</p>
<p>GURGAON, INDIA -- Doctors in Canada told Sandra Kniffen there was nothing more they could do for her.</p>
<p>The 57-year-old, who has multiple sclerosis, would just have to cope with poor balance, numb limbs and shaky hands that didn't co-operate any more.</p>
<p>But when a friend told her about a new procedure being performed by doctors in India that might bring her some relief, Kniffen leapt at the chance to come here. She shrugged off recent reports of a drug-resistant superbug that reportedly originated in India and is spreading around the globe.</p>
<p>In a 700-bed hospital outside the Indian capital, doctors performed a venoplasty on Kniffen, a three-hour, $5,700 procedure to unblock her veins and arteries.</p>
<p>Such blockages can limit the flow of blood to the brain. They affect motor skills, the circulatory system and are common in patients with MS.</p>
<p>On Monday, three days after her surgery, Kniffen was busy planning a quick trip to the Taj Mahal and joking with her daughters about being able to catch a package of gum one had tossed her way earlier in the day.</p>
<p>"People at home said I should wait, but I'm going to be 90 before this is available in Canada," said Kniffen, a former nurse. "It's not like we don't have problems in Canada, too. We have had SARS and the H1N1 flu and I can honestly say this has been first-class treatment."</p>
<p>Hospitals and medical industry officials in India say foreigners, Canadians included, continue to flock here for surgical procedures despite concerns over a newly published medical study that says a bug - New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1, or NDM-1 - is showing up in some patients after they leave India.</p>
<p>The study, released by Cardiff University researchers and published in The Lancet, a respected medical journal, has sparked a backlash from government officials in India who say the country's booming medical tourism industry has been unfairly targeted.</p>
<p>"The truth is this kind of drug resistant bug comes from drug overuse," said Pradeep Thukral, founder of Safemedtrip.com, a consulting company in New Delhi that links foreign patients with about 10 Indian hospitals.</p>
<p>"Doctors in the West are so willing to keep giving more antibiotics with higher potencies and a patient's resistance naturally goes down."</p>
<p>Thukral said every patient bed at hospitals in the medical tourism business has antibacterial gels.</p>
<p>"Doctors and nurses use them before and after they touch a patient," he said. "It's become a rigid part of policy."</p>
<p>Gurgaon, the New Delhi suburb where many foreigners go for procedures, can be disconcerting. Herds of cows and pigs lazily roam the roads. Medanta Medicity, the hospital where Kniffen went for her surgery, is flanked by dingy huts made of scrap metal.</p>
<p>But it's a different story inside Medanta, where doctors use equipment such as a 360-degree slice CT scanner, a state-of-the art machine that shows doctors accurate images of a patient's arteries and organs.</p>
<p>"There are maybe two or three in the world," Thukral said.</p>
<p>An estimated 500,000 foreigners travel to India each year for surgical procedures and officials said spinal and cosmetic surgeries are the popular choices, although treatments to offer relief for MS are becoming more common. Medical tourists come here for treatments that have long queues in Canada, and for procedures that haven't been approved elsewhere. The Confederation of Indian Industry has said medical tourism could generate $2.3 billion in annual revenue by 2012.</p>
<p>"You have Sick Kids Hospital in Toronto which is really a centre of excellence," Thukral said. "But we have 50 hospitals of this calibre and within two years, we'll have 50 or 100 more."</p>
<p>Doctors who graduate after seven years of medical school make about $400 a month, which makes that kind of expansion possible, he said, smiling as he held up a BlackBerry to show a message indicating six more Canadians had checked into Medanta for procedures.</p>
<p>Calgary's Stu Taylor arrived in New Delhi last week with his wife Maureen, who, like Kniffen, had surgery to provide some relief from her MS. Taylor said he and his wife were pleased with her procedure, although they were concerned that nurses gave her needles without first putting on gloves.</p>
<p>"But there was nothing dramatically distressing," he said.</p>
<p>Sharon Fehr, of La Crete, Alta., was another Canadian in New Delhi for a procedure after the superbug warnings.</p>
<p>"I have really been so pleased with how it's gone," she said, noting she's only been taken aback by small cultural differences, such as being served hot milk on her cereal.</p>
<p>"I had no hope in Canada. I didn't have time to wait decades for help. India has given that to me."</p>
<p>Sandra Kniffen went to India for treatment for MS. The former nurse shrugged off the reported superbug threat.

<p>All the Tamil migrants who arrived at CFB Esquimalt on Friday, including those taken to Victoria General Hospital for treatment, have been moved to detention facilities on the Lower Mainland, Canada Border Services Agency said yesterday.</p>
<p>The agency updated its count of people who travelled to Canada on the cargo vessel MV Sun Sea, saying it has found 492 people, up two from the 490 announced last week.</p>
<p>There are 380 men, 63 women and 49 children. The agency said the total number of adults and minors can change because the identity and age of the migrants must still be confirmed.</p>
<p>The adult migrants have been detained for examination under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, border services said in a statement.</p>
<p>Border services will conduct detailed screenings of the adult migrants to determine whether they can be admitted to Canada.</p>
<p>"Individuals will remain in detention pending the completion of a detention review by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada," border services said. The hearings begin today.</p>
<p>The Tamil migrants who were admitted to Victoria General Hospital have been discharged in good health, said Suzanne Germain, spokeswoman for the Vancouver Island Health Authority.</p>
<p>All six of the migrants, including two pregnant women and two children, admitted to the hospital were released by Sunday afternoon. The passengers were healthier than expected, with none in critical condition, she said.</p>
<p>One man died on the ship and was buried at sea.</p>
<p>Preparing for the migrants, amid concerns they could have serious illnesses after their three-month journey on a cargo ship, was a critical test of VIHA's emergency response plan, Germain said. "This was a limited test of our ability to gear up staff to respond."</p>
<p>The emergency plan was drafted last fall during the H1N1 scare, but fears of a massive outbreak never materialized.</p>
<p>The hospital reopened a ward on the seventh floor to keep the migrants separate from other patients.</p>
<p>The Hospital Employees' Union agreed to last-minute schedule changes to staff the decommissioned ward.</p>
<p>Male patients were handed over to border services officials while women and children will be cared for by the Ministry of Children and Family Development at a "secure location" on the Lower Mainland, said ministry spokeswoman Christine Ash.</p>

</p>
<p>SAO PAULO, Brazil --</p>
<p>Guadalajara arrived in Brazil confident it can win the Copa Libertadores title despite a disappointing home loss to Internacional in the first leg.</p>
<p>Guadalajara, known as Chivas, lost 2-1 in Mexico and now has the difficult task of beating Internacional in front of its fans in Wednesday's decisive match in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre.</p>
<p>“We know the importance of this match, we know what it took for us to get here,” Chivas goalkeeper Luis Michel said. “We have faced great teams before and managed to earn the results we needed. We must leave our hearts on the field to try to get past our opponent.”</p>
<p>Trying to become the first Mexican club to win Latin America's most important club competition, Guadalajara arrived in Brazil on Saturday to begin its preparations for the match at Beira-Rio stadium.</p>
<p>The team's match against Estudiantes de Guadalajara in the local Apertura tournament was postponed so it could travel to Brazil ahead of time and focus on the Copa Libertadores. The players already practised at the Beira-Rio on Sunday.</p>
<p>“We are adapting to the weather and the pitch,” Chivas midfielder Xavier Baez said. “We know that we will need to play with a lot of focus to be able to get a positive result.”</p>
<p>Chivas led Internacional 1-0 in the first leg but allowed two second-half goals that put the team at a disadvantage heading into Wednesday's second leg.</p>
<p>There is no away-goals rule in the Copa Libertadores final, so any victory by a single goal will be enough for Guadalajara to take the decision at least into extra time.</p>
<p>“We have played well as visitors and this time it can't be an exception,” Chivas midfielder Marco Fabian said. “We have to leave everything on the field. We know there won't be any other matches, this is the last one.”</p>
<p>Chivas began this year's competition in the second round after being forced to pull out of the 2009 tournament because of the swine flu outbreak in Mexico.</p>
<p>Opposition clubs refused to travel to Mexico at the height of the disease and Copa Libertadores organizer CONMEBOL — the governing body of South American soccer — allowed Chivas and fellow Mexican side San Luis a spot in this year's last 16, the same stage they had reached before the withdrawals in 2009.</p>
<p>Guadalajara became only the second club from Mexico to reach the final since the country accepted the invitation to join the Copa Libertadores in 1998. Cruz Azul lost the 2001 final to Boca Juniors.</p>

<p>Heed lessons from H1N1 flu, Editorial Aug. 10</p>
<p>You rightly point out "several weaknesses in this country's pandemic response . . . of the threat posed by H1N1." Another shocking detail is that the published criteria for those eligible to receive the vaccine left out adults over 65 years of age. Even those with diagnosed "compromised health issues" were denied at the door; even with a doctor's note.</p>
<p>I wonder how much the numbers would have gone up if these adults were initially included. I also shudder how many of their lives would have been lost had the pandemic been more severe.</p>
<p>Next time, politicians, spare us the propaganda that those of a certain age are immune to H1N1.</p>

<p>Re: Heed lessons from H1N1, editorial Aug 10, and The real lessons of H1N1, Opinion Aug 13</p>
<p>I have read both of these opinions with much interest. With respect, as an older adult I think these articles have left out a very important dimension. That is, the unfortunate exclusion of adults over age 65 who were pointedly unable to obtain the vaccine upon the outbreak of the virus in October 2009.</p>
<p>The government's published criteria is evidence that this population, and even those with "comprised health conditions" were not included. In my community when I presented my doctor's written recommendation that I should receive the vaccine, I was consistently asked what my age was and was turned away. Not until I threatened to go to the media was I then able to acquire my vaccine on Nov. 5.</p>
<p>The Richard Schabas/Neil Rau article repeats the questionable assumption that "older people"... had... "immunity from previous exposure to a similar virus that circulated up until 1957." Where is the evidence? Why do our health specialists think that older adults are not just as worried as anyone else when told they are at risk because of their "compromised" health?</p>
<p>This is not an age issue, it is a health issue.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No science backs up 'miracle cure'</b>
</div><div>JOE SCHWARCZ   </div>
<div>Freelance</div>
<div>1077 words</div><div>14 August 2010</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>B5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Malaria, AIDS, hepatitis, herpes, cancer. Terrible diseases. That's why thousands and thousands of scientists around the world, armed with advanced degrees, are engaged in research projects aimed at finding a cure.</p>
<p>Now, ask yourself this question: What is the chance of a gold prospector, with no training in the health sciences, tackling a problem and finding an answer that has eluded the world's most renowned researchers? Furthermore, it's simple to administer, readily available and destroys the H1N1 virus, clears up acne, eliminates heavy metals and cures the common cold to boot. I can tell you what probability I would attach to this miracle solution performing as claimed. Let me see now, how does "zero" sound?</p>
<p>There's nothing subtle about the name of this purported wonder: "Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS)!" Well, there are no miracles to be had. Or minerals. Admittedly, however, there is a solution. Not a solution to any problem, but a solution in the sense of a substance being dissolved in water. And that substance is sodium chlorite, a common disinfectant and bleaching agent. Its chief promoter, Jim Humble, is either a brilliant inventor, a self-delusional scientifically-bewildered simpleton or a cunning scoundrel. Take your pick. I know which box I would tick off.</p>
<p>In a decidedly non-humble fashion, Humble claims that "this breakthrough can save your life, or the life of a loved one." He then brags that his discovery is "the answer to AIDS, hepatitis A, B and C, malaria, herpes, TB, most cancers and many more of mankind's worse diseases."</p>
<p>Of course you may not have heard of this revolutionary treatment, because it is being hidden from the public by those devilish pharmaceutical companies whose profits would be destroyed if the word got out about all diseases being cured in such a simple fashion.</p>
<p>Let's just trace how this visionary, this wonder worker, this mental colossus, discovered the gift "that would shift the course of human health history forever."</p>
<p>Incidentally, MMS wasn't this amazing philanthropist's first gift to humanity. That was the automatic garage door opener, which humble Humble supposedly invented, although I can't find any documented evidence for this claim.</p>
<p>In any case, the MMS saga begins in the South American jungle where our hero was prospecting for gold when two of his men fell ill with malaria. With no prospects for immediate medical help, Humble had to resort to his razor-sharp wits.</p>
<p>The sodium chlorite solution they had brought along to disinfect water obviously killed bacteria, maybe it would also destroy whatever was causing the malaria. So, he gave the men some of the solution and was stunned to see their symptoms vanish in just four hours. I bet he was!</p>
<p>Now Humble had a new calling: rid the world of malaria.</p>
<p>He started to treat sick South Americans but found that the sodium chlorite solution was only effective 70 per cent of the time. Not good enough for this dazzling mind!</p>
<p>He began to experiment with his concoction and discovered that when mixed with citric acid, the chlorite would be converted to chlorine dioxide, which turned out to be a superior product. Wow!</p>
<p>Before long, Humble claimed to have registered 75,000 successful treatments of malaria with his miracle product.</p>
<p>Strange, but I can't find any of these spectacular results documented in the scientific literature. Wouldn't you think that the discovery of such a simple cure for malaria would merit publication? Surely a Nobel Prize would be in the offing! Ah, I know. It must be those dastardly jealous scientists, or the evil pharmaceutical companies that are preventing publication. Yup. Must be.</p>
<p>As a supporter explains, "Humble had become so famous that two drug companies contacted the Minister of Health (in an unnamed country) and threatened to quit shipping drugs to the local hospitals if she didn't do something about the person claiming to be able to cure malaria."</p>
<p>Those fiendish companies! It's a wonder they have allowed Humble to live.</p>
<p>Actually, maybe they haven't. Attempts to contact him have repeatedly failed. I'm told he is "travelling" the world, busily helping people. Helping them lighten their wallets, I suspect.</p>
<p>If you want to know the details of his discovery -that is "how to manufacture it in your own kitchen, how to use it intravenously, how to cure colds in an hour, how to cure the worst of flu in 12 hours, how to treat cancer, AIDS and hundreds of other problems" -you have to buy his book.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to describe that epic work, but "comedic" comes to mind.</p>
<p>Discussions about how chlorine dioxide "elongates the electron shell" of pathogens, and how its safety is confirmed by the fact that its "oxidation strength" of 0.95 volts is less than oxygen's 1.30 volts, amount to no more than mindless chemical chatter. I don't buy it. More importantly, Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration don't buy it, either. And both urge consumers not to buy any version of Miracle Mineral Supplement.</p>
<p>Not only is there no evidence of efficacy for any condition, there is evidence of possible harm. Nausea, vomiting, and a life-threatening drop in blood pressure have been reported.</p>
<p>Humble actually maintains that nausea is a good thing because it means the body is eliminating toxins, but if bothered, he suggests it can be controlled "by eating cold apple slices that will absorb stomach toxins that have been dumped there." Like I said, comedic.</p>
<p>But what is decidedly not comedic is the advice on some MMS websites that AIDS patients give up their drugs and resort to intravenous MMS.</p>
<p>Jim Humble went out looking for gold and it seems that at least figuratively he has found it. But it is fool's gold.</p>
<p>MMS is not based on any reasonable science, has not been tested in any sort of randomized trials, and amounts to no more than a scheme to capitalize on the gullibility of the scientifically challenged and the desperate.</p>
<p>Promoting the sale of this product is criminal.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Travel health: The voices of experience; Insurers share tales of what went wrong for these travellers</b>
</div><div>James Daw  Toronto Star   </div>
<div>934 words</div><div>14 August 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>U8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Some experts offered anecdotes and advice to guide consumers through the purchase of travel health insurance:</p>
<p>Is this trip necessary? Seniors should really not travel with medical conditions that are not considered "stable," says Bob Dickson, of Bob Dickson Insurance Services, Carleton Place. They could need medical attention that would not be insured outside of Canada. Why take the financial risk just to have a holiday?</p>
<p>Not all advice is good. A man came to Ron Singer, associate broker, Megacorp Insurance Agencies Inc., Mississauga. He was taking medication for a heart condition and having regular tests. Yet, says Singer, "a salesman who was not licensed to sell insurance told him not to worry; his heart attack was five years ago. This advice was contrary to the application form." Other consumers do not know how the stability period on health conditions in policies affects coverage, or to report a change in health condition to make sure their coverage will not be jeopardized. They do not know a 1-800 medical help line in Canada will not work in most other countries.</p>
<p>Look in your medicine chest! "Usually when I start by asking new clients if they have any pre-existing conditions, the answer is, 'No'," says John Wilson, M. Butler Insurance Brokers Ltd., Niagara Falls. After asking more questions, he hears answers such as this: "I'm only on medication for high blood pressure;" "I only have a stent," and "I only have atrial fibrulation (fast and irregular heartbeats)."</p>
<p>Is there a doctor in Shangri-La? Snowbirds considering travel to exotic or remote destinations need to consider such things as language barriers, the quality of local medical care, the availability of transport to another medical care facility, and the services and benefits your insurer can offer to help you cope with an emergency, says Angela Gordon, RBC Insurance.</p>
<p>Questions, questions, questions. A client with pre-existing medical conditions did not renew or extend a 60-day travel insurance policy before it expired, says Robin Ingle, chairman Ingle International. "To find him coverage, we needed to make sure nothing had happened to change his eligibility. The client became angry, and did not answer our health questions until two days later when a manager called." He was still angry when Ingle called later. He said his wife had bought travel insurance at a bank, without having to answer such questions. But Ingle knew the plan's restrictions. "He would not be covered for a medical emergency. We wanted to make sure he would be covered."</p>
<p>Prices are up, prices are down. Shop around each year! A couple in their mid 70s wanted annual, 30-day, multi-trip policies they could top-up for longer trips, says Ken MacCoy, registered health underwriter, Edge Marketing Group, Chilliwack, B.C. Last year, MacCoy found policies for $570 with the same coverage that had cost them $721 the previous year. This year, a third company was cheaper. It was charging $451, down from $700 last year.</p>
<p>When you need to stay longer. "When you want to extend a stay, you need to ensure you've purchased top-up coverage," says Christine Raymond, Avalon Actuarial Consulting Inc. Not all plans allow top-ups, and some that do, may require additional medical underwriting. Coverage can generally be extended if a delay is beyond your control, such as a hospitalization, flight delay or natural disaster, typically for three to five days beyond the delay at no additional charge.</p>
<p>Make sure you qualify! The out-of-country coverage that comes with group medical plans is much less stringent on pre-existing medical conditions than individual travel insurance, says Michael Sanderson, group benefits consultant, <span class="companylink">Programmed Insurance Brokers</span>, Elmira. But an employee must be working a minimum number of hours to qualify, or their claim could be denied for fraudulent participation.</p>
<p>In case you have to cancel. Travel has been disrupted in the past year due to volcanic ash from Iceland, an earthquake in Haiti and the H1N1 virus, says Christine Raymond, Avalon Actuarial Consulting Inc. This should highlight the value of trip-cancellation protection, and the importance of checking for travel advisories on Department of Foreign Affairs website before buying travel insurance, or leaving Canada.</p>
<p>Read what you purchased early on! Read your insurance policy before the deadline for rescinding it (usually within 10 days), says Milan Korcok, editor of TravelinsuranceFile.com, Florida. This is particularly important when purchasing coverage over the phone or Internet. "A sales agent may say you're covered for everything, but you're not," Korcok says. No travel health insurance is a match for what the government provides while you are at home in Canada. "Every policy will have restrictions, conditions and limitations. There will be no coverage if you do not disclose all relevant health information."</p>
<p>Proving when you came and went. John Wilson, M. Butler Insurance Brokers Ltd., Niagara Falls, says he urges clients: Keep toll, gasoline or bank receipts to prove when you leave and return to Canada in case you need to make a claim! Notify the insurer's emergency assistance line of a potential claim and file a claim form as soon as possible! Not all insurers increase rates or restrict coverage at the same ages, for a single blood pressure or water pill, trip to the doctor, or for a change to a newer drug.</p>
<p>You may want to pack travel insurance, too. Find out just what your insurer will cover before you do.   </p>

<div>BLOC QUÉBÉCOIS / NO LONGER TEMPORARY</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Twenty detail-obsessed years in politics; Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe is determined, prepared and no where near the end of his political career</b>
</div><div>DANIEL LEBLANC   </div>
<div>1147 words</div><div>14 August 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

   </div>
</p>
<p>Gilles Duceppe readily admits to harbouring obsessive tendencies.</p>
<p>If a painting on a wall is crooked, he will stand up midway through a meal to set it straight. He called his daughter repeatedly last year when she was pregnant to ensure that she received the H1N1 vaccine and plans to do it again this year to remind her to install her winter tires.</p>
<p>“I'm always placing things back where they belong,” he says. “There is nothing astray on my desk. I'm sure that for my advisers, it must get annoying once in a while.”</p>
<p>The Bloc Québécois Leader confesses that his school-principal wife has found him to be obsessive, a neat freak, and more.</p>
<p>“Yolande tells me that I'm hyperactive, and somewhat of a maniac for details,” he says.</p>
<p>It stands to reason, then, that if Mr. Duceppe had a recipe for longevity in politics, the instructions would be freakishly precise.</p>
<p>This week marks his 20th anniversary as MP, and the Bloc Leader has developed a routine for his days on Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>Mr. Duceppe leaves for work at 6:40 a.m. He reads eight or nine newspapers at the office, before getting ready for the day's Question Period.</p>
<p>He brings a lunch to eat in his office, having prepared food for himself and his wife the previous weekend. He goes to the gym in the afternoon, and ends his days by watching the news and then reading a book, aiming for 200 pages a week.</p>
<p>Mr. Duceppe says he is always thinking of upcoming events. He insists that every detail be nailed down before he emerges into the foyer of the House of Commons to speak to reporters, in the same way that he is already getting ready for the next leaders' televised debate. Speaking about an upcoming 20-kilometre bike ride, he says he will be engaging in a lot of internal dialogue.</p>
<p>“It's an occasion for me to practise my lines for the debate. I debate with the other leaders, I go through their attacks, I give my answers, and I pedal,” he says.</p>
<p>Much has been said in recent years about Mr. Duceppe and the Bloc, especially the irony of the party's longevity in Ottawa and its failure to dismantle the federal system from the inside. But the anniversary of Mr. Duceppe's first by-election victory on Aug. 13, 1990, also serves as a reminder that he has seen three NDP and four Liberal leaders come and go, and outlived the entire Reform Party/Canadian Alliance experience. If an election were held today, according to the most recent public opinion surveys, the party would win a majority of seats in Quebec for the seventh straight time.</p>
<p>While the Bloc has won a series of legislative victories over the years, its biggest coup is convincing Quebeckers, election after election, that they need a distinct voice in Ottawa.</p>
<p>The other key element of the Bloc Québécois Leader's personality, according to his long-time adviser Pierre-Paul Roy, is that he is as much at ease “in a salon as in a back alley.</p>
<p>“He likes getting into a scrap. We have to be careful on that front and sometimes tie him down,” Mr. Roy says. “That is his natural instinct, and it helps explain his longevity. He is determined, and he wants to win.”</p>
<p>Mr. Duceppe explains his tight control over the Bloc caucus by comparing politics to a football game. The team spends a week trying to prepare for its opponent, with the coach gathering information from all of his players. When the game starts, the time for consultations is over, and the coach is in charge.</p>
<p>“When the players are in their 20-second huddle before a play, it isn't the time to start debating the game plan,” he said.</p>
<p>At the start of the 2008 election campaign, Mr. Duceppe told Quebeckers that the Bloc was the best bet to prevent the Conservatives from obtaining a majority. The first few days of the campaign were rough, but he stuck to his message. When a furor over relatively small cuts to cultural programs erupted in the middle of the campaign, the Bloc was there to reap the rewards, and won 49 of 75 seats in Quebec. The Conservatives fell short of a majority.</p>
<p>Mr. Duceppe says he has no intention of quitting as Bloc Leader, the position he has held since 1997 after Lucien Bouchard left to become Quebec premier. Now 63, Mr. Duceppe has talked of staying on into his 70s to continue fighting for his dream of Quebec sovereignty.</p>
<p>While his professional life is largely in Ottawa, he speaks fondly of his time back in Montreal with his family, including his children who were 11 and 16 when he became an MP, and are now in their 30s with kids. He gets especially excited when he talks about how he prepares romantic dinners with his wife on Friday nights, at which point some of his main traits are particularly appreciated. “Everything is neatly set up, and I change the plates and cutlery for each course,” he says.</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>A BRIEF HISTORY</p>
<p>How did the Bloc Québécois come into existence?</p>
<p>The coalition was made up of Conservative and Liberal MPs who quit their parties after the death of the Meech Lake Accord on June 23, 1990, and banded together in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Where does Mr. Duceppe fit in?</p>
<p>He was the first person to be elected as a member of the group in a by-election on Aug. 13, 1990. The Bloc was officially created the following year, with Lucien Bouchard as leader until 1997.</p>
<p>The Bloc was supposed to be a temporary political force; why does it still exist?</p>
<p>The Parti Québécois government failed to win a referendum on Quebec sovereignty in 1995, but the Bloc insists it must continue to promote sovereignty and defend Quebec's interests and values in Ottawa.</p>
<p>What have been some of the Bloc's biggest victories?</p>
<p>The party takes partial or total credit for the Harper government's move to address the “fiscal imbalance” between Ottawa and cash-strapped provinces, the recognition of the Québécois as a nation and the previous Liberal government's opposition to the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>Is Mr. Duceppe close to retirement?</p>
<p>The 63-year-old will run in the next election, and has spoken of staying on at least into his 70s. For now, he will take in a corn roast in a park in his Montreal-area riding on Saturday, and attend a gala on Sunday, to celebrate his two decades in Ottawa.</p>

<p>NEWS ITEM: Farmers in a parched district of northern Bangladesh are marrying off frogs in a desperate bid to bring on monsoon rains and protect their crops. The country suffered its driest July in decades, prompting farmers to turn to the centuries-old rainmaking ritual. At one of the ceremonies, 300 villagers attended in their best clothes. -- Agence France-Presse</p>
<p>Finally. A ray of hope.</p>
<p>Assuming the opposite of Bangladeshi weather lore holds true, that single and divorced frogs prevent rain, the only question left is whether we in Saskatchewan are that desperate to take action. I suspect the answer this summer rises as a single chorus of voices, be they parkland or prairie, east, west or south, in one resounding word: "Glub."</p>
<p>That would be a yes.</p>
<p>Oh, a few skeptics likely remain. Not to disparage the religious beliefs of any culture, but ours is a technologically advanced western society, they'd argue, in which science long ago separated weather fact from superstition. We know full well the way to control our climate is not by marrying off amphibians. It is by switching to curly lightbulbs.</p>
<p>Yet there's no denying what our eyes see. Everywhere in soggy Saskatchewan are culprit frogs -- big frogs, little frogs and frogs that, when you hold them up by their front legs for a rear view, have no discernible buttocks, just a wrinkled sag, like me in my relaxed-fit blue jeans, indicating old-married-guy frogs.</p>
<p>Too late for them. Future monsoons could be prevented, however, by intervening now before young frogs in love take their own altar vows, for better or worse, richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, until they croak.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most so-called "frog-mating" research concerns itself only with the honeymoon ritual, which is called "amplexus." The male frog grasps the female's frog front legs from behind and -- bahwn chicka wah-wah -- eggs are fertilized in the water. Says here in my encyclopedia that male frogs often perform amplexus on "other species too large for food" or "any pliable object," sometimes for hours on end.</p>
<p>So we're not that different, we humans and frogs.</p>
<p>Inter-species mating by guy frogs is well-documented in the only published account of a frog wedding, that of 20th-century folksinger-scientist Burl Ives, who observed: "Frog went a-courtin' and he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huh ... He rode up to Miss Mousie's door, uh-uh, uh-huh." Ives went on to note that after the marriage proposal there was a HUGE argument about where to hold the reception and what to serve. (Ives double-checked and confirmed every one of the scientific observations, noting on each: "Uh-huh, uh-huh.") When Frog and Miss Mousie eventually settled on way down yonder in the hollow tree, with fried mosquito and black-eyed pea, the flyin' moth had the damn gall to bring her own table cloth, the juney bug her own water jug, and that's not all. The bubbly bee got all liquoured up and danced a jig with the broken black flea, the little black tick ate so much that it made her sick and the big black snake devoured the wedding cake -- in short, the entire Frog-Mousie reception was a disaster, absolutely ruined, all because the couple made the common wedding planning error of inviting guests.</p>
<p>As I said, we're not so different, humans and frogs.</p>
<p>Marrying off frogs with mice would only exacerbate Saskatchewan's climate, anyway. Those of you who have been following the news this week will know that in a rare moment of contrition, we in media confessed that, OK, so, anyway, that whole H1N1 mass-panic vaccination deal last year? A tad unnecessary, as it turned out, our bad, so sorry. Also, this just in: Saskatchewan mice are pooping deadly hantavirus! Hybrid frog-mouse offspring, pooping plague and bringing more monsoons, is a pandemic beyond even the media's ability to exaggerate.</p>
<p>Our secret weapon has to be The Other Frog, the bimbo frog who comes between paired frogs, preventing marriage and breaking engagements. Frogs all look the same, though, and have no esthetic reason for infidelity. No married frog ever did a double-take across the creek and thought to himself, "Yowza! Check out that pliable object!"</p>
<p>So we need an undercover babe frog, just one, to flirt like a complete floozie and spread romantic discord on our behalf. Extending the reverse theory of Bangladeshi rainmaking to fables, if a homely frog kissed by a fair maiden turns into a handsome prince, why wouldn't the opposite hold true, that a fair maiden kissed by some total gomer turns into a hottie frog?</p>
<p>A total gomer Saskatchewan already has (see accompanying illustration at top of column).</p>
<p>Auditions are now open for fair maiden.</p>

<p>Public health units were stretched, information was contradictory and Canadians lost confidence in their governments during the H1N1 pandemic, says a report released Thursday on the challenges physicians faced during last year's worldwide flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"Strained is a good word to describe the situation, all the provinces were very strained," said Dr. Cathy MacLean, president of the College of Family Physicians of Canada and a family doctor in Calgary.</p>
<p>"We had patients coming into the office asking questions, unsure of what was happening, confused about conflicting information. People were just opting out of getting vaccinated after a while because they didn't know what to believe any more."</p>
<p>More than 80,000 physicians from CFPC, the Canadian Medical Association and the National Specialty Society of Community Medicine contributed to the 15-page report, which concludes with eight recommendations and one message: The Public Health Agency of Canada needs to create a unified, national response in times of potential public health crises.</p>
<p>MacLean said family doctors are the first line of defence during disease outbreaks, but they felt the urgent need to provide consistent, correct information was not recognized by the country's public health officials. Instead, doctors received daily messages from public health, medical associations and regional medical experts all offering contradictory advice.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The real lessons of H1N1; There was little or no flexibility to scale the pandemic plan down in case of a mild outbreak</b>
</div><div>Richard Schabas and Neil V. Rau   </div>

</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has called off the H1N1 "pandemic." It's about time. There has been little to no H1N1 activity in Canada since November and anywhere on Earth since February, as demonstrated by WHO's own global surveillance system.</p>
<p>So what actually happened? The simple answer is: not much out of the ordinary. Yes, hundreds of millions of people were infected and tens of thousands died, but worse happens almost every year from influenza. There were differences - higher rates than usual in younger people and much, much lower rates in older people. H1N1 was just the flu and not a virulent mutating superbug. On balance, the WHO's own assessment (from August 2009) that H1N1 was "slightly worse than a normal influenza season" seems about right.</p>
<p>H1N1 was a pandemic without teeth because it was only half a pandemic. It turns out the virus wasn't so novel after all. It was indeed a pandemic in "younger" people - those born after 1957 - but this is the age group that almost always shrugs off influenza. H1N1 was not a pandemic in older people probably because of immunity from previous exposure to a similar virus that circulated up until 1957. It is precisely these older people who are most vulnerable to influenza.</p>
<p>The supposed danger of H1N1 for healthy young people was grossly exaggerated. The median age of death from H1N1 in Canada was 53 - younger than usual from influenza but not exactly young - and the great majority had serious underlying health problems. Far more healthy young people were killed by automobiles than by H1N1 during the pandemic.</p>
<p>These patterns first emerged in Mexico in April 2009 and stayed consistent throughout. The picture was crystal clear by July 2009 following the winter outbreaks in Australia. Ironically, the more benign the evidence the more bellicose our rhetoric became.</p>
<p>Canada responded to H1N1 with an aggressive immunization program. A recent "study" of Ontario's program, published in the for-profit journal Vaccine, claims that this was all worthwhile - preventing a million cases of disease and more than 50 lives. Editorial writers have been quick to endorse this study. Too quick.</p>
<p>The truth is more prosaic. The Vaccine study is flawed. It is based on a theoretical modelling and assumptions rather than on real data. Its conclusions are unreliable.</p>
<p>Our analysis, based on real Ontario disease and immunization data, paints a very different picture. The impact of immunization appears to have been tiny - reducing the outbreak by less than one per cent. Immunization prevented fewer than 20,000 cases of influenza illness and no more than three deaths. This is not nothing but it is a very small return for an outlay of more than $250 million.</p>
<p>Immunization against H1N1 had very little benefit because it came too late. Immunization didn't even begin until after the late October peak of the fall outbreak. It is unclear whether this was anyone's fault. Were decisions made last summer to delay the production of H1N1 vaccine to complete the production of seasonal influenza vaccine? If so, this was a serious error that needs to be acknowledged and learned from.</p>
<p>Immunization against H1N1 carried on for far too long. There was virtually no benefit at all from immunizations given after the middle of November because the outbreak was over by the time the vaccine had any effect - about 10 days after administration. Concerns about another winter wave of influenza (the "third wave") were unjustified from the evidence and, as events have shown, they were wrong.</p>
<p>The global experience further documents the futility of Canada's quixotic efforts. Countries that immunized less than Canada (the U.S., for example), much less than Canada (the U.K.) or not at all (Poland) had H1N1 experiences similar to ours.</p>
<p>So what lessons should we learn from all of this?</p>
<p>Look before you leap. When a new infectious disease problem emerges, the premium must be on gathering and analyzing reliable information rather than triggering preconceived and inappropriate responses. The perception that these events are emergencies requiring instant response is overstated. A little thoughtful reflection will be invaluable.</p>
<p>React to facts, not fears. Pandemic plans gave little or no flexibility to scale down measures for a mild (or ultra-mild) pandemic. Everything was geared to a 1918-style disaster - more of a phantom than a real threat in our modern world. Once activated, the plans took on lives of their own.</p>
<p>Keep the politicians away. Public health officials can and should change their minds when new evidence emerges. They can be wrong without shame so long as they stay flexible and open-minded. Reversing fields is much more difficult for politicians. Our persistence with H1N1 immunization long after it had any value had much to do with political face-saving.</p>
<p>Never exaggerate. Public health's greatest asset is credibility. The unfortunate tendency to overstate the dangers of H1N1 will only mean that some people will doubt our word when we have something really important to say.</p>
<p>Be your own toughest critic. Public health authorities - federal and provincial - have yet to produce any rigorous evidence-based analysis of the H1N1 experience. If we don't identify our mistakes, how can we learn from them?</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Schabas is the Medical Officer of Health for the Hastings and Prince Edward Counties Health Unit and was Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health from 1987-97. Dr. Neil Rau is an Infectious Diseases Specialist and Medical Microbiologist based in Oakville and a Lecturer in the Department of Medicine (Division of Infectious Diseases) at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>A Toronto Public Health Nurse loads syringes with H1N1 vaccine on Nov. 18, 2009, the first day the general public could get a flu shot. By that time there was virtually no benefit from the immunizations.

<div id="hd"><b>WHO flu experts had ties to drug firms; Health agency denies conflict of interest on H1N1 strategy</b>
</div><div>Joanna Smith  Toronto Star   </div>
<div>752 words</div><div>12 August 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star   </div>

<p>OTTAWA -- A committee of experts that advised the World Health Organization on the H1N1 flu pandemic included some members who declared minor financial ties to drug companies, the international public health agency revealed Wednesday.</p>
<p>Three members of the emergency committee that advised director general Dr. Margaret Chan on the H1N1 pandemic work at public health agencies in the United States and United Kingdom that have received research funding from pharmaceutical companies or their industry associations.</p>
<p>A fourth member had previously worked as a paid consultant for five different vaccine manufacturers.</p>
<p>The WHO said all ties were disclosed to the committee, which decided they did not constitute conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>"A declaration of an interest does not constitute a conflict of interest, so (there is a) very big difference between the mere fact of contact or collaboration with a pharmaceutical company and that constituting a conflict of interest," WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It was felt after everything was brought out in the open that the specific nature of what they had done in terms of their consultancies did not constitute a conflict of interest."</p>
<p>The international health authority came under fire in June when a prominent medical journal alleged scientists with undisclosed financial ties to drug manufacturers had helped develop its pandemic strategies.</p>
<p>The article noted that guidelines published in 2004 urged countries to stockpile antiviral medication in advance to avoid scrambling for supplies when an outbreak occurred, but the WHO failed to disclose that three of the committee members who contributed to the document had at one point received funding from companies that manufacture antiviral drugs.</p>
<p>The joint investigation by the BMJ (formerly called the British Medical Journal) and the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism also spoke out against the WHO for keeping the lid on the names of its 15-member H1N1 emergency committee.</p>
<p>The head of an outside review panel that will probe the WHO response to the H1N1 pandemic has said the committee would examine accusations of undue influence, such as those raised in the BMJ article, as part of its work.</p>
<p>Hartl defended the secrecy as essential to protecting members from outside influence until the WHO declared the pandemic was officially over Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The names of those expert advisers in any expert advisory group are always revealed only at the end of their work in order to prevent their work being influenced," Hartl said.</p>
<p>Arnold Monto, a member of the H1N1 committee, has done consultancy work for pharmaceutical giants <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, <span class="companylink">Novartis</span>, Roche, Baxter and Sanofi, and was compensated no more than $10,000 (U.S.) by each of them.</p>
<p>Monto said a confidentiality agreement prevents him from speaking about exactly how the committee came to agree that declared interests did not pose a conflict but noted that things such as the extent of involvement and whether someone could profit from giving a particular opinion - which could always be rejected by the WHO - would come into play.</p>
<p>Monto said it is unrealistic to expect pandemic policy advisers to have never had any contact with pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>"Do you want a situation where you have firewalls so that nobody can talk to anybody else, in a situation where we are dependent on industry to produce the vaccines that we need?" Monto, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"I believe in a more nuanced approach, because that's the way the world works."</p>
<p>Michelle Smolenaars Hunter, a spokeswoman for GlaxoSmithKline Inc. in Mississauga, said the WHO and governments have made it "very clear" that "industry is not part of the public health decision making process" and that interactions between everyone involved in pandemic planning "have been governed by the highest standards of openness, transparency and ethics."</p>
<p>Dr. Nancy Cox, director of the influenza division of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, disclosed that her surveillance unit receives funding from the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associates, an industry association.</p>
<p>Dr. John Wood and Dr. Maria Zambon both work at the British Health Protection Agency in units that have done contract work for several vaccine manufacturers.</p>
<p>Neil Morris Ferguson, who acted as an adviser to the committee, acted as a consultant to two vaccine manufacturers in 2007, receiving $7,000 (U.S.)</p>
<p>Advisers to WHO director general Margaret Chan received research funds from drug companies.

</p>
<p>MONTREAL -- He's a Machiavelli-quoting, early-rising political dynamo, and it appears he's just won a high-stakes game of political chicken with his boss, Premier Jean Charest.</p>
<p>Amid a cabinet shuffle that saw a dozen ministers switch portfolios – and two jobs cut altogether – perhaps the largest figure left standing was Health Minister Yves Bolduc, a former family doctor and current opposition lightning rod who was widely rumoured to be marked for demotion.</p>
<p>Indeed, speculation has run rampant in provincial political circles that Dr. Bolduc had bluntly threatened to walk away from politics if he was pushed from his ministry's helm.</p>
<p>Although the energetic 53-year-old Saguenay native brushed aside that talk – and resulting headlines – as “fiction and conjecture that is absolutely false” at a news conference in Quebec City, he allowed in a later television interview that “I came into politics to do health.”</p>
<p>According to people within the health system who are well acquainted with Dr. Bolduc's work habits, he rises with the dawn each morning and often makes it his first task to pore over that day's surgical waiting lists. He has reputedly instructed office clerks in some hospitals – he is famous for impromptu site visits – on how he likes his spreadsheets prepared and colour-coded.</p>
<p>But that same punctiliousness has led political opponents to describe him as a micromanaging meddler, and it hasn't rendered him immune to caustic criticism over his handling of waiting times, lingering nursing shortages or last year's mass vaccination for H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Groups ranging from the province's specialist doctors and the main nurses union to patients-rights advocates had bayed for Dr. Bolduc's ouster in recent months, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Mr. Charest went to unusual lengths to express his confidence in his Health Minister at the shuffle announcement, where he indicated that Dr. Bolduc “is a man with exceptional knowledge of the system, and he has our full support.”</p>
<p>But an opposition Parti Québécois politician scoffed that Mr. Charest “yielded to blackmail” and was too concerned about losing Dr. Bolduc's Quebec City riding to risk having him quit in a huff.</p>
<p>In truth, the cabinet moves are perhaps best viewed as an exercise in conflict avoidance, both in form and in substance.</p>
<p>“[Mr. Charest] had to do something, he didn't want a repeat of the fireworks of the last session … he's really trying to reduce the tension,” said Antonia Maioni, a Quebec watcher and head of McGill University's Institute for the Study of Canada.</p>
<p>Although he pared the number of ministers from 26 to 24, Mr. Charest maintained his policy of gender parity and welcomed an old new face back to the fold in the person of Jean-Marc Fournier.</p>
<p>The former Quebec municipal affairs and education minister was plucked from his post in federal Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff's office, where sources said his departure has provoked dismay.</p>
<p>But the unelected Mr. Fournier's nomination to the Justice portfolio hardly qualifies as an infusion of new blood – no backbenchers were elevated to cabinet.</p>
<p>“It shows a lack of depth on the bench,” Dr. Maioni said.</p>
<p>The Charest government has faced a torrid past few months, highlighted by allegations concerning judicial nominations and the government's refusal to hold a public inquiry in light of continuing corruption probes in the construction industry.</p>
<p>Through it all, three cabinet ministers have either resigned, been fired or quit politics.</p>
<p>After this week's exit of the pugnacious Jacques Dupuis, a former government house leader and public security minister, Mr. Charest decided it was time to shuffle the deck.</p>
<p>Abrasive ministers such as Mr. Dupuis and weaker performers Michelle Courchesne (shipped from Education to the Treasury Board) and Kathleen Weil (who went from Justice to Immigration) were replaced with more convivial, less aggressively partisan faces like Robert Dutil, who moves from Revenue to Public Safety, and Line Beauchamp, the soft-spoken former environment minister, who now oversees Education.</p>
<p>“Just because you move people around doesn't immediately make them better at their jobs,” Bernard Drainville, the PQ's health critic, told a news conference in Quebec City.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) announced Tuesday that the H1N1 "swine flu" pandemic was officially over. The declaration came only about six months after virtually everybody else in the western world realized that nothing like a pandemic, as we normally understand the term, had ever really begun.</p>
<p>Thirteen months ago, the WHO raised the swine flu threat to a Level 6 pandemic alert, the highest possible. "It is all of humanity that is under threat," warned Margaret Chan, the WHO director-general. The organization projected millions of souls might be struck down by the virus; the WHO's assistant director-general drew comparisons to the Spanish Flu, which had wiped out upwards of 20 million people by 1919.</p>
<p>It quickly became apparent that H1N1 would be nothing like that. And never will be. The WHO says this is now just another "seasonal influenza." As those bugs go, it appears a milder strain. More common varieties kill 250,000 to 500,000 people worldwide every year. The total confirmed death toll of the Great Swine Flu Pandemic: 18,000.</p>
<p>The world's most authoritative body suddenly seems far less authoritative, particularly as it resists acknowledging unnecessarily triggering worldwide fear. "We have never had a moment's doubt of whether this is a pandemic or not," insisted one official recently.</p>
<p>But then, the agency looks at these things very differently than most people -- many of whom surely have grave doubts about how the so-called Swine Flu pandemic was handled from the start.</p>
<p>The WHO, after all, considers all pandemics potential threats to humanity. Its scientists also have a distinct way of establishing a pandemic. Any virus that jumps from animals to human-to-human transmission "leading to community-wide outbreaks" in two countries triggers warnings.</p>
<p>In recent years, the organization stopped requiring "several, simultaneous epidemics worldwide with enormous numbers of deaths and illness"; now pandemics "can be either mild or severe." To qualify, a virus, until 2008, needed to "shift" and spawn subtypes. This criteria, too, was removed.</p>
<p>"Although this change seems subtle, it is a significant change, and is a potential problem with the new WHO pandemic definition," cautioned an editorial in the British Medical Journal's "Clinical Evidence" last year.</p>
<p>But the UN-run health body has hardly exercised caution in communicating such semantic technicalities. Instead, it has sounded the pandemic alarm loudly and dramatically. Dr. Chan says it was "pure good luck" H1N1 didn't confound our vaccines and antiviral drugs and deliver widespread death. If that's luck, then humanity is on some streak: in 2005, the WHO predicted 150 million dead from the H5N1 Avian Flu, though the confirmed toll never reached even 100; the Global Health Council anticipated the 2003 SARS outbreak wiping out 60 million lives, but the final tally ended up below 800.</p>
<p>In every case, people and economies have been more afflicted by contagious panic -- closed borders, travel bans, shuttered schools and businesses, edgy consumers, mass livestock culls and billions spent by taxpayers on protection programs -- than by contagious disease.</p>
<p>This is not the concern of Dr. Chan, who has argued, anyway, that believing modern, liberalized trade improves living conditions and health worldwide is mistaken. Such systems "favour those who are already well off," she told the Regional Committee for Europe, last September. Progress comes, rather, from redistribution: "Gaps in health outcomes will be reduced and health systems will strive for fairness only when equity is an explicit policy objective, also in sectors well beyond health," she said. We need "changes in the functioning of the global economy."</p>
<p>With that philosophy, it makes sense that Dr. Chan might mistake for "pure luck" what is more likely the fruit of progress, driven largely by liberalized commerce. WHO officials suggest devastating pandemics are inevitably cyclical: After the millions of deaths caused by the Spanish Flu, the Asian Flu (1957) and the Hong Kong Flu (1968), the next is due "any time now" they've promised. But in each subsequent pandemic, the world was a richer, better-fed, generally healthier place -- and each time, mortality rates grew</p>
<p>smaller.</p>
<p>Epidemiologists know influenza viruses prove deadliest in victims weakened by preexisting complications. Since the Spanish Flu, public health is incalculably better: we've developed and commercialized sulfa drugs and penicillin; we've improved vaccines; and malnutrition levels in the developing world are half what they were 40 years ago. The fact that H1N1 did not outfox human vaccines and anti-virals might seem lucky to those lacking faith that human enterprise and innovation can also prove ingeniously adaptable and potent.</p>
<p>It may be there will never be another decimating flu plague on the scale of past ones again.</p>
<p>Predictably, though, the WHO has only taken its massive Swine Flu misjudgment to warn against growing "complacent," as another threat could one day come. But the false alarms have only bred doubt about the WHO's own trustworthiness, popularizing theories that the agency colludes with Big Pharma while nourishing skeptics who convince the gullible that vaccinations are a dangerous scam. Even the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe called this a "faked pandemic."</p>
<p>If we do ever become complacent about genuine viral pandemic threats, it may be the unfortunate result of the World Health Organization's emerging pattern of needless panics.</p>

</p>
<p>Half of Saskatchewan's population lined up last year for a vaccination against the H1N1 flu pandemic that was officially declared over this week.</p>
<p>It is due in part to that vaccination effort that Saskatchewan hasn't actually recorded any influenza cases since the end of 2009, said Dr. Saqib Shahab, the province's deputy chief medical officer.</p>
<p>"We saw the second wave end very abruptly in December," Shahab said.</p>
<p>"We weren't sure if we would see a small third wave or not. In Saskatchewan we were confident that we wouldn't because of high immunization rate."</p>
<p>Indeed, there was no influenza in Saskatchewan from January onwards, "which is unprecedented," Shahab said.</p>
<p>Even the usual seasonal flu strains weren't seen, as the H1N1 flu virus had largely elbowed the other strains out of the picture.</p>
<p>Shahab noted that in "practical terms" the pandemic was already over here, when the World Health Organization on Tuesday declared that the pandemic is done on a global scale. The announcement received little fanfare, with health headlines already focused on other emerging stories, such as research identifying a "superbug" in hospitals in India that's resistant to antibiotics.</p>
<p>But even though the pandemic wasn't as severe as had been feared, the H1N1 virus was linked to 15 deaths in Saskatchewan. Most of those individuals also had underlying health conditions, Shahab said.</p>
<p>The pandemic also took an economic toll on hog producers. Because the virus was initially dubbed "swine flu," pork prices suffered even though there was no scientific reason for concern about the meat.</p>
<p>Shahab said the province is already preparing for its annual flu program this fall, with this year's seasonal flu shot to include the pandemic strain, as well as other strains that are expected to circulate.</p>
<p>"Certainly for young children, for people over the age of 65, pregnant women, and people with underlying risk factors, it is extremely important that they do get the seasonal vaccine this year once it's available," he said.</p>
<p>Shahab said the good lessons emphasized last year need to be remembered, such as coughing into the sleeve versus the hands, and regular hand-washing.</p>
<p>For the province, the experience also proved it helps to be flexible, he said. "We had a pandemic plan, just like the Canadian plan, but we didn't just open the plan and follow it blindly," he said. "We were responsive to changing situations -- who does the virus affect, who should be the first to get vaccinated and who should receive antivirals -- and I think that's the key."</p>

<p>As the World Health Organization declared an official end to the H1N1 pandemic on Tuesday, a leading Canadian public-health expert warned that the influenza strain that put the planet on edge for months could force this country to rethink its annual flu-fighting strategy and get a better grip on the illness's true death toll.</p>
<p>The world is no longer in Phase 6 of pandemic alert -- a full-blown pandemic.</p>
<p>But H1N1 is expected to continue circulating for years and to cause serious disease in younger people, a group flu normally spares.</p>
<p>If H1N1 maintains its total dominance among all flu strains, and sticks to its pattern of affecting mostly the young, "we need to be prepared to shift rather quickly our seasonal flu programs to reflect that new reality," said Dr. Kumanan Wilson, Canada research chair in public health policy at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>"It's a new disease. It's not the same disease as we've been treating. It's a disease that affects a different population with a different mortality rate."</p>
<p>The National Advisory Committee on Immunization normally recommends priority for seasonal flu shots be given to immunizing people at high risk of flu complications, including the elderly and those with chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>But early in the pandemic, Canadian researchers discovered H1N1 was behaving in startling ways, preferentially attacking the young and generally healthy, causing catastrophically low levels of oxygen in the blood, serious lung damage, viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure in some.</p>
<p>"The key is to realize that we're not dealing with the same seasonal flu that we did in the past," Wilson said. "We're sort of at ground zero on the evidence chart.</p>
<p>"If we have H1N1 as the primary strain going forward next year, and our seasonal flu strategies are designed for a virus that affects the elderly, and H1N1 does not appear from the data we have so far to be as lethal in the elderly (as previous strains) ... we may have to recalibrate our vaccine strategies and our target populations."</p>

</p>
<p>The World Health Organization says it's time to stand down. The swine-flu pandemic is now officially over.</p>
<p>Most Canadians gave up worrying months ago about the first official flu pandemic in 40 years. And rightly so. The big scary H1N1 virus turned out to be more Clark Kent than Superbug and while some people got seriously ill and many died, the toll was less than would be expected during a normal flu season.</p>
<p>B.C. Provincial Health Officer Perry Kendall said Tuesday that one saving grace was an aspect of the new virus that was first perceived to be one of its most troubling traits, the fact that it affected young people more seriously than seniors.</p>
<p>In an average flu season, 200 to 400 deaths are attributed to influenza. Most of them are seniors with other health problems. The death toll from the H1N1 outbreak was just 57.</p>
<p>We didn't come even close to the worst-case scenario, in which businesses would have been operating on skeleton staffs, hospitals would have been overwhelmed and schools and other public institutions closed.</p>
<p>So was this a case of health officials crying wolf? Should we have been concerned enough to buy millions of doses of vaccine, much of which will now be destroyed? Were people wasting their time waiting hours in lineups for a shot? Were we subjected to a vaccine that was riskier than the disease it was designed to keep at bay, as so many bloggers claimed?</p>
<p>Kendall says that while lessons have been learned, health authorities were right to treat the H1N1 as a serious threat when reports of a mysterious illness started emerging from Mexico in the spring of 2009.</p>
<p>They were particularly alarmed about the number of young people dying.</p>
<p>"It sounded like a quite explosive spread of a very serious virus."</p>
<p>As we learned, the time it took to get a vaccine designed, produced and into people's arms meant that health officials couldn't wait until everything was known about the new strain before committing to a battle plan.</p>
<p>The public response to the frightening worst-case scenarios being aired also contributed to none of them coming true. Canadians became germophobes. Hand-washing became a national obsession; waterless hand-sanitizers popped up at churches, grocery stores and just about everywhere else people gathered.</p>
<p>People who showed up to work sick were shunned. And a healthy supply of antiviral drugs and effective emergency health care gave people who picked up the virus a much better chance of recovering.</p>
<p>By the time the vaccine was easily available for everyone, the worst of the epidemic had passed. Even so, 43 per cent of British Columbians were immunized, with much higher penetration in groups considered to be particularly at risk.</p>
<p>And how safe was that vaccine? Critics claimed the adjuvant used to make it more potent was a hazard on its own and the vaccine itself could trigger Guillain-Barre syndrome, in addition to other serious side effects.</p>
<p>With well over a million doses delivered across the country, Health Canada reported there was no increase in GBS above what normally would have been expected from other causes. Also, the number of other serious reactions were within the normal range for any vaccines and represented a far less serious risk for most people than the flu itself, even in the not-quite-so-scary form in which it finally presented itself.</p>
<p>Even though the pandemic is officially over, flu watchers still expect H1N1 to be around this winter and they will include a vaccine for it in the mix being prepared for distribution before the season starts all over.</p>

</div><div>Caroline Alphonso  </div>

</p>
<p>The World Health Organization declared Tuesday that the H1N1 pandemic is over, saying it has “largely run its course.”</p>
<p>Director-General Margaret Chan said the global health body has assessed what is happening around the world, and has decided to move into the post-pandemic phase.</p>
<p>“As we enter the post-pandemic period this does not mean the H1N1 virus has gone away,” Dr. Chan said in a conference call from Geneva. She said that based on experiences with past pandemics, the H1N1 virus is likely to take on the behaviour of seasonal influenza virus and circulate for some years to come.</p>
<p>The WHO has come under criticism for declaring H1N1 pandemic, with critics saying the organization provoked unnecessary fear with a virus that turned out to be much milder than expected.</p>
<p>But Dr. Chan defended the WHO’s action, saying the June 11 pandemic announcement was based on epidemiological and other health criteria. “That was the right call,” she said, adding the world was lucky the virus was milder and that an effective vaccine was developed quickly.</p>
<p>The WHO’s announcement followed a meeting Tuesday morning by an emergency committee that advises Dr. Chan. The committee is a panel of external and as yet unidentified experts who have advised Ms. Chan on major matters related to the pandemic.</p>
<p>In many parts of the world, the WHO’s announcement will not come as a surprise. In Canada, the H1N1 virus peaked last fall and there has been virtually no flu activity since the start of this year.</p>
<p>Since H1N1 was declared a pandemic last year, it has claimed more than 18,000 lives worldwide, although it has remained far milder than expected. The health-care system in Canada wasn’t pushed beyond capacity.</p>
<p>There were cracks in the country’s response, however.</p>
<p>There was confusion as to when the vaccine would be available, and then when it did become available, the vaccination rate was much lower than expected. Less than half – 41 per cent – of Canadians lined up to receive the vaccine.</p>
<p>Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, Arlene King, acknowledged recently that public-health officials neglected to properly organize a mass immunization program.</p>
<p>Public-health officials and medical experts, taking stock of the country's response to the pandemic, point to three reasons for the low vaccination rates: a failure to communicate the risks of the pandemic and the safety of the adjuvant; sequencing guidelines that gave priority to high-risk groups and were not followed by some provinces, confusing the public; and Ottawa's inability to inform provinces fully of the weekly vaccine supply, which stalled planning.</p>

<p>The local tourism industry is still struggling to recover from the recession, with Calgary hotels forced to cut room rates to attract visitors.</p>
<p>The most recent available numbers show a 2.4 per cent drop in hotel occupancy rates for the first five months of 2010 and a 1.8 per cent decrease in the average daily room rate to $139.30 this year through May.</p>
<p>Those trends appear to be continuing in the summer, according to a market update released Friday by the province on the Travel Alberta website.</p>
<p>In the update, the Calgary Hotel Association reported that occupancy rates improved slightly during the first weekend of the Calgary Stampede, but dropped below 2009 levels in the second weekend, even after room rates were cut.</p>
<p>"The numbers look pretty flat to last year," said association spokesman Fraser Abbott. "Some properties did notably better than last year but some did worse, so we're expecting it to be about the same as last year."</p>
<p>In 2009, a total of about 2.7 million people visited the city, spending about $1 billion, according to Tourism Calgary.</p>
<p>That was a four per cent drop in visitors from 2008, a decrease blamed mainly on the recession, but other factors included H1N1 fears, the rising Canadian dollar and new U.S. passport rules.</p>
<p>Tourism Calgary projects a two per cent increase in visitors this year, and CEO Randy Williams says the city is still on track to achieve that boost.</p>
<p>"We've hit bottom and we're starting to curve up," said Williams. "But that 2008 level, we'll still have trouble hitting that this year, but by 2011 we should get back to the 2008 numbers."</p>
<p>While the numbers for the summer months won't be tabulated until the fall, Williams said he has seen some positive indicators.</p>
<p>"Anecdotally, we're hearing that most businesses are seeing growth over last year, we've heard of five or 10 per cent growth with some," said Williams. "But we've seen others that are down in expectations."</p>
<p>Tourism officials say visits from domestic tourists have held strong, and international visitors could be lured by the recent addition of new direct routes to Calgary from overseas, including Tokyo, Seoul and Amsterdam.</p>
<p>"Certainly they were looking for a rebound in recovery after a soft year last year," said Don Boynton, spokesman for Travel Alberta.</p>
<p>"There has been optimism that this would be a turnaround year, at least the start of the recovery."</p>
<p>Some of the city's biggest tourist attractions appear to be holding their own or even improving.</p>
<p>Heritage Park is exceeding its own expectations for paid attendance.</p>
<p>The park bucked the recession trend last year by increasing numbers through the gates, largely due to a $65-million expansion that was unveiled in April 2009.</p>
<p>So far this year, the park is on track to better last year's total attendance of 391,337 by as much as 10 per cent.</p>
<p>"Last year, we opened the largest expansion in our history and had a stellar year for a recession year," said Heritage Park spokeswoman Sandra Kam.</p>
<p>"After a big expansion, you tend to spike and then go down a little, but so far, we're trending above last year."</p>
<p>The Calgary Zoo reports that July saw marginal changes from the same month last year with a 2.5 per cent increase in visitors from the United States, a one per cent rise in international customers and a five per cent drop in Canadian patrons from outside Alberta.</p>
<p>"August is our busiest month of the year, so we're expecting all those numbers to go up," said Zoo spokeswoman Trish Exton-Parder. "But, overall, we seem to be managing just fine."</p>

</div><div>493 words</div><div>10 August 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Since last fall, when the threat posed by the H1N1 influenza peaked in Canada, few of us have worried about this rogue flu virus. But the World Health Organization has remained on guard against the pandemic - monitoring its ebb and flow, tallying deaths and hospitalizations, and watching for any trace of mutation into a more virulent virus.</p>
<p>Now, at last, WHO officials report strong indications that H1N1 has evolved into a relatively benign seasonal flu; they are preparing to declare the pandemic officially over.</p>
<p>With the sounding of an "all clear" close at hand, lessons learned in battling the pandemic are also moving into sharper focus. And that knowledge, gained both locally and at the international level, could prove vital in blunting the impact of future pandemics.</p>
<p>Several weaknesses in this country's pandemic response were starkly exposed in the harsh glare of the threat posed by H1N1. To obtain life-saving vaccine, the federal government signed a contract with only one manufacturer, rather than spreading its order among several. That resulted in bottlenecks and production delays.</p>
<p>Furthermore, distribution of the vaccine was lamentably uneven, with access to the shots varying from one province to another, and even between public health units within the same province. There was near-universal outrage as small children and others in high-risk groups found themselves stuck in line waiting to be vaccinated while sports stars and hospital executives were allowed to jump the queue.</p>
<p>The crisis peaked by the time the vaccine became available in large quantities, and most people didn't bother getting a shot. Just over 40 per cent of Canadians were immunized against H1N1.</p>
<p>Even more disappointing was the failure of many front-line health care workers to protect themselves, with just 39 per cent of staff working in Toronto's long-term care facilities opting be vaccinated - far short of provincial guidelines calling for 70 per cent of health-care staff to be immunized.</p>
<p>On the bright side, even this country's flawed pandemic response produced positive results. Although Ontario's H1N1 mass immunization program only began in late October, as the outbreak was peaking, it managed to prevent almost 1 million cases of flu and save 52 lives, according to a study published last month. Writing in the medical journal Vaccine, researchers report that the provincial program prevented 420 hospitalizations, 28,000 visits to hospital emergency departments, and saved $20 million.</p>
<p>Some of what went wrong could readily be corrected by signing contracts with more than one vaccine-maker. Other important reforms would be harder to implement, such as breaking down bureaucratic silos to create a more centralized, uniform and efficient pandemic response system.</p>
<p>Steps should also be taken to motivate the public and health care workers to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>The worst legacy of a relatively mild H1N1 outbreak might well be indifference when the next pandemic comes along. Such complacency could have tragic consequences.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization is expected to declare the H1N1 influenza pandemic officially over in the next week.</p>
<p>That means it will be downgraded to a typical seasonal flu – not a global killer. As the end approaches, many may wonder whether public health experts were crying wolf over H1N1.</p>
<p>In fact, Ottawa behaved responsibly in introducing a $2-billion universal vaccine program – even if it was hobbled by logistical problems, a confusing communications strategy, and a tardy roll-out.</p>
<p>Globally, H1N1 killed 18,000 people, including 428 in Canada. Some of its victims were healthy, young adults. While the virus was not as deadly as feared, there was no way of knowing that in advance.</p>
<p>“If H1N1 had been really serious and we treated it as a mild flu bug, critics would have blamed us for being cavalier,” says Dr. Perry Kendall, British Columbia's provincial health officer. “You have to plan for a really bad scenario, and then modify plans in response to less serious scenarios.”</p>
<p>Although only about 40 per cent of Canada's population received the H1N1 vaccine, below the government's target of 70 per cent, the initiative still saved many lives. In Ontario, the vaccine averted nearly one million cases of H1N1, and as many as 50 deaths, according to a study by the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion.</p>
<p>The response to the H1N1 outbreak was also a good test run for Canada's pandemic preparedness. And there will be another pandemic.</p>
<p>Public health officials fear that avian flu, a virus that normally infect only birds and pigs, could be it. This contagious disease is species-specific, but has, on rare occasions, crossed the species barrier. More than half of humans infected with the virus have died.</p>
<p>Officially, a pandemic begins when three conditions are met: a new influenza virus subtype emerges; it</p>
<p>infects humans, causing serious illness; and it spreads easily among humans. Avian flu already meets the first two conditions, according to the WHO. With each new human case, the virus improves its ability to transmit in humans. “While neither the timing nor the severity of the next pandemic can be predicted, the probability that a pandemic will occur has increased,” warns the WHO.</p>
<p>As the H1N1 pandemic ends, Canadians cannot afford to be complacent about the proven value of flu vaccines – or about the probability of the next pandemic.</p>

<p>B.C. health officials are predicting a "more normal" flu season this year as the H1N1 swine flu dies out around the world.</p>
<p>"We are not likely to get another epidemic wave of H1N1," Dr. Danuta Skowronski, a physician with the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, said yesterday.</p>
<p>Skowronski said she believes the World Health Organization will officially declare an end to the H1N1 pandemic later this week. "They have been monitoring the Southern Hemisphere, where activity has remained low," she said.</p>
<p>Skowronski said H1N1 was less severe in B.C. than it might have been because of "a highly effective vaccine [that] blocked sustained transmission."</p>
<p>Forty-three per cent of B.C.'s 4.5 million residents received the vaccine against H1N1. There were 57 lab-confirmed fatalities from H1N1 and 1,080 hospital-treated cases.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization may announce the official end of the H1N1 pandemic within days.</p>
<p>The virus has killed more than 14,000 people worldwide since April 2009 and prompted a mass vaccination across Canada, where more than 400 people died.</p>
<p>Tim Vail, spokesman for federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, said Sunday there has been a drastic drop in H1N1 cases since its second wave in late 2009.</p>
