<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oct. 09--E.J. Scott won't be the only runner with a visual disability in Sunday's Chicago Marathon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he probably will be the only one calling attention to his condition by covering his imperfect eyes -- and certainly the only one doing so with fabric torn from a curtain that belonged to the star of a hit television series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blindfold he'll run in, the 34-year-old Chicago improv actor explains, is partly a metaphor for the degenerative retinal disease that is stealing his vision, currently shrunk to the point where he sees life as if "through a toilet-paper tube."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wants to win attention and research money for the fight against the disease, choroideremia, in hopes that science will be able to save not only what's left of his eyesight but that of his 24-year-old brother and 5-year-old nephew, who also have the rare, inherited disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even more than a symbol, the blindfold will be a form of protection. Sunlight further weakens Scott's eyes, hastening the blindness that is the prognosis for nearly all who have choroideremia. Sunlight also triggers his extreme light sensitivity, often bringing on headaches so agonizing it would be hard to run 6 miles with them, much less 26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought about running the marathon a long time ago," says Scott. "I thought, 'I can't do it, because if I did it, I'd have to be blindfolded, and that's crazy.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott was also overweight most of his life and avowedly "not an exercise person." But during a six-month period ending in February, Scott shed 70 pounds and raised $14,000 in pledges for the Choroideremia Research Foundation, dropping to a fit 196 lbs. on his nearly 6-foot-3 frame. Running suddenly became not only not crazy but a way to keep the weight off and his activism efforts up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's nervous about being injured and about navigating the course's many turns. But just as he now walks with a cane, he'll run with the guidance of a cousin and cousin-in-law, both experienced runners. And he found strength in the cheers he got from strangers when he ran two half-marathons blindfolded this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's going to be tough," he says. "I'm trying not to put too much pressure on myself. I want to finish. I want to get my medal. I want to have my picture taken. And then I want to go home, have my girlfriend take care of me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The girlfriend is where the TV-show reference comes in. His significant other of three years is Deborah Ann Woll, the vampire Jessica on HBO's hit "True Blood." Before Scott ran the half-marathons, the couple decided he should practice running without seeing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, they went to a track and tried to work out the best way for a blindfolded runner to hang on to his guide. He has kept the blindfold, a strip of an old heavy curtain Woll used for applying cosmetics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple met when the Long Island native was still in LA, chasing the actor dream. When Woll, now 25, first encountered him on a Match.com profile, she says, she thought that listing his disease signaled honesty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That same quality, she says, has helped them stay together even as Woll found celebrity and Scott moved to Chicago, partly because of the city's public transportation (he no longer drives), partly because of the thriving improvisational comedy scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He feels like he has limited time to do the things he wants to do," says Woll. "While he had the sight and time and motivation, he wanted to go to Chicago and train with the people (who) are important to him."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, Scott, who is legally blind and gets by on Social Security disability checks, moved in 2008 to the Andersonville neighborhood, near the Annoyance Theatre, where he has taken classes. He has decided he wants to teach improv, but he continues to perform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday night at iO Chicago's Cabaret Theater, Scott played, among other characters, a fearsome dragon angered by the death of his son and the stern father of a dreaming boy. At one point, he stood tall, puffed his chest out and proclaimed, "Like I always say, I'm the hero."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott's eye problems actually help his improv team, The Diplomat Motel, says Jeff Hedges, a fellow member. "We have to be making eye contact," Hedges says. "You're forced to connect with him onstage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott and his younger brother Kevin were diagnosed with choroideremia at the same time. Kevin, 16 at the time, had a black eye. In checking his sight, a doctor discovered something he thought might be retinitis pigmentosa, a different vision-stealing disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because RP is hereditary, E.J. accompanied his younger brother on the follow-up visit to a specialist in New York City. The dual diagnoses of choroideremia -- the absence of an essential protein that leads to loss of cell layers necessary for vision -- put things into place for E.J. Scott: the friendly extended hands he sometimes didn't see, the maternal grandfather who had gone blind in his 40s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, recalls Kevin, the diagnosis "was most devastating to my mother. It tore my mom apart. I was 16. I was just going along for the ride. My brother took it and at first wasn't going to let it affect him. But it really hit my mom hard."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The single gene that causes choroideremia is passed from father to daughter on the X chromosome. It steals, in succession, night vision, peripheral vision and colors, before causing blindness. Women rarely show symptoms, but their sons, E.J. Scott explains, have a 50-50 chance of being affected. His sister's 5-year-old son has the disease; her 1-year-old son has not been tested yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's frustrating to Scott and others with choroideremia is that they believe the only thing separating them and their family members from effective treatment is money. Dr. Jean Bennett, at the University of Pennsylvania, has had success using gene therapy to treat a similar disorder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're no longer tossing money against the wall and hoping something will stick," says Cory MacDonald, operations director of the Choroideremia Research Foundation (curechm.org). "The doctors know what is wrong and they know how to fix it. It's just a question of raising the cash."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But choroideremia affects very few, and it'll take $2.5 million for Bennett to start clinical trials, MacDonald says. Although the fundraising pace is quickening, it's mostly been mom-and-pop stuff: Scott's weight loss; a cross-country bike ride he did with his brother-in-law, father of his nephews; a charity auction held by his parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With E.J., if we had about 50 of him, we would have raised that $2.5 million already," says MacDonald. "He really has a personal vendetta against choroideremia."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday night at the Annoyance (8 p.m., 4830 N. Broadway), Scott will host a benefit for choroideremia and a celebration, he hopes, of his completing the marathon. The superstars of Chicago improv will be there, including Susan Messing, T.J. Jagodowski, David Pasquesi, and frequent Second City director Mick Napier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of the time, I either want to cry or scream," Scott says. "It's not just me. It's my brother. It's my 5-year-old nephew, maybe my 1-year-old nephew, and it's all these other people that I'm meeting. It's really frustrating ... but I just try to push through and go forward and keep it up."</p>

<div id="hd" ><b class='enHeadline'>Funding vital to finding cures</b>
</div><div class="author">By Julie Kusku Special to the Detroit News   </div><div>494 words</div><div>15 September 2010</div><div>The Detroit News</div><div>DTNS</div><div>no-dot</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>(c) Copyright 2010, The Detroit News. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 10 million Americans are affected by diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration that cause blindness. Alarmingly, with an aging population that number is expected to increase 50 percent by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many of us have never heard of these diseases, let alone understand their causes and effects, the possibility of their impact on our lives or the lives of those around us is significant. Here, in neighborhoods across Detroit, people of all ages meet the challenges of life with blinding diseases every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty years ago, my then 5-year-old son was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa. Our doctor informed us that people with this condition lose their vision at some point during their life. He gave us hope when he told us that he believed during my son's life a cure would be found. Soon after the diagnosis, we joined the local Foundation Fighting Blindness chapter for support and information. My son has a very small field of vision and cannot see anything in the dark. Despite his condition, he teaches math at a high school in the Greater Detroit area and runs marathons. We are always working toward finding a cure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is thrilling that for the first time in history, there is real hope for restored vision for people affected by retinal diseases. Recently published results from a breakthrough study, funded in part by the Foundation Fighting Blindness, show that gene therapy restored significant vision in five children and seven adults who were previously blind due to a severe form of retinitis pigmentosa, a blinding genetic disease that affects people from birth. By injecting a missing gene directly into the back of the eye, patients experienced dramatic improvements in visual acuity, peripheral vision and light sensitivity. With a variety of ongoing clinical trials, this breakthrough sets the stage for the use of gene therapy in many more retinal diseases, with hope for further success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This trial would not have been possible without the essential financial support provided by foundations and other funding organizations. Nonprofit organizations often provide the start-up venture philanthropy capital necessary to begin new research not funded by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With federal funding for medical research limited to supporting studies with proven results, unexplored research receives little to no funding. In essence, venture philanthropy funding is the catalyst that can drive research to widespread funding from federal sources, such as the National Institute of Health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of us has the opportunity to play a pivotal role in such venture philanthropy, whether by investing our time as volunteers or our dollars as funders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our involvement and dedication to nonprofit organizations that offer support for medical research is critical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now more than ever, supporting early research can significantly impact the lives of our neighbors, friends and families today and for generations to come.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less war and more domestic support will not pay quick dividends as the national and local economies grind along, says noted Florida economist Hank Fishkind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is this week's guest on "One on One with Jeff Lytle."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also sizes up employment, Jackson Laboratory and his role as a consultant to BP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is an edited transcript of the first half of the interview program; video highlights as well as partial video/texts of past interviews are available at naplesnews.com/oneonone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entire 30-minute program airs today at noon on <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> Channel 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle is editorial page/Perspective editor of the Daily News.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: We heard the president last night (Tuesday) talk about phasing out our military operations to focus more resources and time and effort on the national economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does an improvement in the economy necessarily follow that? Does he have it right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: I think it's a basic right idea. Sure, we need to invest more in our country. We need to give less resources over to foreign adventures. No doubt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: But how soon can we look for an impact from that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: Oh, that's pretty far off – a couple of years maybe, at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's going to happen over the next 90 to 120 days is baked in the cake, Jeff. Nobody is going to change that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, the recovery is stalled. Odds are that we don't have a double-dip recession, but it's not impossible. Fiscal policy is no more stimulus; no more political appetite for it. It's too late to make it work effectively for the next 90 days anyway. So it's left to monetary policy to try to provide a safety net should the economy begin to turn sour again ... or more sour than it's turned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: Looking back on the stimulus, some would say it was a total, total bust. Others would say, yeah, but we'd be in worse shape if we hadn't done that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: It's the latter. Anybody who says that it was total loss just isn't reading the data and has a political agenda purely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economics are that we would have been in much worse shape. This would have been the "Great Depression," not the "Great Recession" had we not taken the steps that we've taken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: Even though we got ourselves into deeper debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: Correct. Deeper debt in the short run is OK. If deeper debt in the short run was a problem, interest rates would be much higher. We have some of the historically lowest interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not that the deficit is not a problem, Jeff. It is. It's just not a problem right now. Right now our problem is we're mired in a recession, and we need additional aggregate demand to get us out of that recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: You're here in the Naples area today (Wednesday) meeting with clients. Can you give us a preview of what you will tell your clients about the economy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: We're going to tell them over the next 12 months interest rates are going to stay very low and aggregate demand is going to be about where we see it today, which is very modest, 1 percent growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: Demand for housing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: Demand for everything in the U.S. economy. In terms of the local area, we're going to tell them that the worst of it is behind us, but there's no recovery in sight for another 18 months. So we are going to kind of bump along the bottom here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Naples area finally has stopped shedding jobs. The last 12 months we actually had 100 jobs on the year-over-year basis. Not enough to be statistically significant, but it depicts and is emblematic of the fact that the worst of the contraction is behind us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean recovery is in front of us, unfortunately. And that's where the conundrum is. We've had 31/2, almost four years of contractions; now we're going to have another two years of prime bam-bam along the bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: Is it possible on a national or a local scene that we will see an economic recovery that does not include new jobs? In other words, could we have a jobless recovery?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: Well, that's what we're having right now. The answer is yes. That's what we're having right now. But when we have jobless recoveries, they typically come after very deep recessions, and what that means is that the overall aggregate amount of growth is very slow –</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 to 2 percent gross domestic product (GDP) basis; 1 to</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 percent gross Naples basis. So unless and until we get more momentum, we won't have neither faster growth nor greater job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: You mentioned GDP, and I want to get this before we go any further. I need to ask you about Jackson Laboratory. One of our readers ... I don't have his letter in front of me, so I can't be very detailed, but here's his pitch. He wanted me to ask you is it possible or true that the local investment, which is $130 million over some time, in the proposed Jackson Laboratory project ... will the size of that investment be a net drag on our economy. In other words, will it reduce GDP in our local area?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: I think that's exactly the right question. My view is, it will increase GDP by a substantial multiple of that investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: Over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: Over time. And I base that on what's happened in Port St. Lucie, where they invested in Torrey Pines and the (Vaccine Gene Therapy Institute), and already there's been a substantial return on that investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a substantial job growth and the creation of a biotech hub that otherwise would not have occurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same thing is happening in and around Orlando with the Burnham Institute for the Veteran Affairs (VA) Hospital; the $300 million that Orlando invested is not being returned today, but I believe there will be a substantial rate of return in excess of 20 to 30 percent over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that doesn't happen every time. Scripps Research Institute has not generated a substantial return on the state's investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: That's in West Palm Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: So there's no guarantees, but two out of three suggests there would be substantial return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: This letter writer – and I just found his document here – his name is Duane Billington. Our readers know him. He is a longtime and intense critic of this project, and that's OK.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think if he were here, he would say, OK, but this is still huge risk. How could you recommend that a community invest this heavily on such a risky proposition?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: Well, I don't think it's a huge risk. It is a risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think this community really is at a very important crossroads. However, it can take some risk to diversify its economy, to change the structure ... there is no biomedical hub here ... really have the opportunity to change the structure and create a biomedical hub, or decide as a community that we don't want to take that risk and we would prefer to be the best tourist and retirement place we can be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's really kind of the crossroads. Communities that aren't willing to take the risks tend to go down a different pathway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And those choices are all good; they're all for the community to make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: We're in the peak of the election season now. We're headed down the home stretch. And all the candidates, even for local offices – and state and federal offices – are talking about the economy; they're talking about "creating jobs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do the elections really matter in how all that plays out? Or is all this just wishful thinking and rhetoric?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: Well, it can really matter, Jeff. But it requires some bold decision-making, and we're real light on bold decision-making. We're real good on lip service about jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: But how can we know whether candidate A, he or she really has it right; or candidate B, not so much?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: I think that there are some obvious things at the state and local levels that can be done. Not the national level. I mean they can't run money fiscal policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I will say for Rick Scott running for governor, he has a bold plan: seven years, 700,000 jobs; eliminate the corporate income tax. I'm not sure all the math adds up for me. But that aside, it's visionary; it's bold; it's the kind of thinking that we would need to be able to create real jobs at the state level with the limited tools that the state has locally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest obstacles to economic growth in this state, and in this community, is the extraordinarily high level of impact fees. The incredibly difficult process of getting anything approved. Those are under the control of the county and city governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, yes, if people really want more jobs, there's a way to accomplish that. But in economics, there are no free lunches. You've got to make some bold decisions and you've got to do some things that maybe everybody isn't going to like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: About your comments about Scott's jobs plan: on the other hand, Alex Sink who is running for governor as a Democrat is no slouch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: Correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: I mean, she has run a large chain of very successful banks, and she has a clue what it's all about too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: Yes, she does, and her program is to invest more in tourism and in trade; and in the short run that would be very stimulative to the economy, and she's correct about that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I think that would be great and pretty bold. Not as bold as Scott, but pretty bold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again, though, my same problem with her is where is the money to come from? There's nothing in "the plan" that explains where the money would come from to expand tourism promotion or to provide export credit, both of which would be great things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I do think those are good examples of bold thinking, but ,,, it's got to add up too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: What impact will the oil situation have on Florida in the long run, and in Southwest Florida in the short run?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: Well, I should make sure that we tell our listeners that I am a consultant to BP. We've been retained by them. I have been an advocate of oil drilling in our coastal waters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, I don't think there's going to be much of any effect. It's not like a nuclear bomb was dropped on the beaches and they're going to unusable for a thousand years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was an oil spill. It was terrible. It was the worst ecological disaster that we've have in this country in a long, long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, the damages to the reputation to the state I think are going to be very short-lived. And I don't think there's going to be any permanent impact at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: A nuclear bomb was dropped on wildlife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: A nuclear bomb was said to be dropped on wildlife. We saw pictures of some wildlife that was dreadfully affected. It is unclear where all the oil has gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: Ah! So maybe it's really too soon to say that the impact on wildlife is not as bad as we feared, because there could still be a lot of damage out there. And also the plant life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: Or worse, or worse. Nobody knows about that yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we do know is that oil that spills up on a sandy beach, as ugly as it is, is relatively easy to clean up. Oil that gets in marshes creates long-term damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: What will you be doing for BP?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: We'll be evaluating the claims. We evaluate all of the government claims. The private claims flow through the Feinberg Panel, the Gulf Coast Compensation Fund. And so there'll be some restitutions or decisions about that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then parties that don't like those decisions can go to court. We'll also act as the expert witnesses for some of the court cases that are pending in New Orleans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: What about property owners who will say, hey look, I own a home near the water, prospective buyers heard there's oil in Florida; Naples is part of Florida; my property value took an indirect negative hit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: Well, I think it's pretty much of a stretch. People will argue that. People will argue every single thing that happened bad in their business was due to BP. Some of it is true. Some of it is a stretch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: So you're ready to argue that it's a stretch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: I think it's a pretty long stretch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: A little example, where we had the local Conservancy rehabilitate some animals who were injured by oil, should they be reimbursed for their efforts? Nonprofit organizations?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: Absolutely, they have a valid claim for costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lytle: But restaurants that took a hit, like on Fort Myers Beach, for example, economy what it is, but still there had to be a reason why business was down so sharply this year as opposed to last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do they have a case?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishkind: Perhaps, even though the oil wasn't proximate on the beaches. It's going to be very fact-driven. People who have oil on their beaches have a better case obviously than people who don't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are fascinating questions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said it couldn't be done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No less a genius than Leonardo da Vinci tried to design a workable airplane. He got as far as building a couple of gliders and apparently even soared off the roof of a barn for a few moments. Discouraged that he couldn't do better, da Vinci wrote:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always long to return."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no matter how much he longed for it, da Vinci did not have the knowledge or the technology to build a working flying machine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither did anybody else, for nearly 400 years. In fact, erudite and respected men of science were predicting as late as the early years of the 20th century that man would never fly. The distinguished American astronomer, Simon Newcomb, wrote in 1903:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The mathematician of today admits that he can neither square the circle, duplicate the cube or trisect the angle. May not our mechanicians, in like manner, be ultimately forced to admit that aerial flight is one of the great class of problems with which man can never cope?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two months after Newcomb's statement, the Wright brothers flew at Kitty Hawk, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this brings to mind Clarke's First Law. Enunciated by Arthur C. Clarke, the great science-fiction writer, it reads:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Controlled fusion power is a case in point. For more than 50 years some of the world's best physicists and engineers have been trying to build a fusion power plant. No joy, so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fusion is a form of nuclear energy. Today's nuclear power plants use nuclear fission to produce energy. In fission, the nuclei of heavy elements such as uranium or plutonium are split apart to release energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In nuclear fusion, the nuclei of the lightest element, hydrogen, are forced together to make helium nuclei. A smidgen of the hydrogen's mass is transformed into energy, and the helium, which is an inert gas, can be given to children to blow up balloons. No radioactive waste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We know fusion works, because it's the process that makes the sun and stars shine. But making it work on Earth is a different story. After 50 years of toil, the best the scientists can offer is the hope of building an experimental fusion facility that just might break even, producing as much energy as it must be fed to operate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fusion researchers say that controlled thermonuclear fusion is just over the horizon – but the horizon is an imaginary line that keeps moving away as you approach it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some predict that we'll never achieve a practical fusion power plant. I presume they fly in airplanes from time to time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy is another example. Half a century after biologists determined the structure of DNA and the molecular code that guides every living cell's existence, pessimists are wondering if we will ever be able to use our knowledge of genetics to cure diseases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some early attempts to insert therapeutic genes in human patients have been outright failures. Patients have died. Yet the research goes on, despite doubts and setbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research in Basel, Switzerland, have used gene therapy to restore sight to blind laboratory mice. If this breakthrough works for humans, victims of retinitis pigmentosa, which is now an incurable genetic disease that causes blindness, will have their sight restored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retinitis pigmentosa destroys the rod and cone cells in the eye. The Swiss research team inserted into the lab mice a gene that directs the building of proteins that can rebuild the rod and cone cells. The once-blind mice reacted to light, and their optic nerves sent signals into the part of the brain that handles vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who said gene therapy won't work are wrong. We are at the beginning of a new era of medical triumphs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the next time you see a distinguished but elderly scientist (and elderly, in this business, can mean anyone over 40) say that something is impossible, remember Clarke's Law. He's probably wrong.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OU reports research to prevent blindness</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center have found a way to use a new type of gene therapy to prevent blindness caused by retinitis pigmentosa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 100,000 Americans suffer from the debilitating disease. The study appeared in the Journal of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research, led by Muna Naash at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center with collaborators in Cleveland and Buffalo, discovered a way to deliver known gene therapies directly to the light-sensitive cells affected by this disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery is being used to develop new treatments for another disease - macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We hope the results of our study will be instrumental in generating a cure for the debilitating blindness associated with retinitis pigmentosa and other inherited and acquired retinal diseases. We want to give Oklahomans and others suffering from these diseases renewed independence and quality of life," Naash said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Integris establishes neonatal transport team</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Integris Baptist Medical Center has established a neonatal transport team with EagleMed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Integris neonatal transport team can be anywhere in the state with an average of one hour or less flight time, in comparison to a helicopter flight time of one-and-a-half to two hours on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neonatal transports are most commonly requested from physicians at smaller rural hospitals when they feel one of their young patients needs more specialized care. The Integris neonatal transport team goes to retrieve the baby, providing Level III care while in the air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We bring our neonatal intensive care nursery directly to the patient," said Debbie McCann, clinical director of the Integris Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. "We carry a full array of lifesaving equipment on-board that allows us to start providing advanced care immediately, including nitric oxide."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transport team includes nurse practitioners and respiratory therapists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team expects to participate in 15 or more air transports each month. The fixed-wing aircraft is used in transports outside of the metro's 90-mile radius or when an infant's critical condition warrants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OSU-CHS creates new Kaiser chair</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oklahoma State University/A&M Board of Regents has announced plans for a George Kaiser Family Foundation Chair in Excellence in Medical Education and Service at the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The to-be-named provost and dean will be the first nominee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board of regents also approved the job description for the OSU Center for Health Sciences' new position of provost and dean, marking an important step in the search process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our hope is to identify a leader to build upon the tremendous accomplishments of our medical school in meeting its mission of providing doctors for rural and underserved Oklahoma," said Howard G. Barnett Jr., president of OSU Center for Health Sciences and OSU- Tulsa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A search committee was appointed earlier this month by OSU President Burns Hargis and will engage a search firm to assist in recruitment. Stanley E. Grogg will continue to serve as interim dean and provost at OSU-CHS until the position is permanently filled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new chair is funded by a previous contribution from the George Kaiser Family Foundation, which is matched by a challenge gift from T. Boone Pickens and when matched by the state of Oklahoma will total $4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences also announced that Grogg has been named associate dean for clinical research and medical director of service learning.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jun. 10--The things Tracie Harris misses seeing most are the lightning bugs and stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An inherited disease called retinitis pigmentosa has been stealing the sight of Harris, 40, but researchers have found a way to use a new type of gene therapy to help prevent blindness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To know that something like this is happening, it's a great thing," Harris said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Because when you find out about it, it kind of takes away your hope."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 100,000 Americans have the debilitating disease, which is the subject of research at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health Sciences researcher Muna Naash, Ph.D., is one of the principal investigators who discovered how to deliver gene therapy directly to the light-sensitive cells affected by the disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This strategy of non-viral gene therapy is very efficient," Naash said during a press conference Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technique of using a microscopic capsule to carry genetic therapy to the cells of the eye's retina is being tested on animals to treat various diseases and Naash said it has rescued the vision in laboratory mice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The procedure carries the therapy to the right spot in the eye within 15 minutes. The technique could eventually be used in treatments of diseases ranging from cancer to diabetes, she said. It's been used effectively to treat cystic fibrosis and in the laboratory for some brain diseases, but hasn't yet moved to patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naash said she hopes to soon collaborate with Dr. Robert Leonard, an ophthalmologist with Dean McGee Eye Institute to take the therapy to eye patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's breathtaking," Leonard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retinitis pigmentosa damages the retina, worsening over time to eventually cut side vision and then sometimes cause blindness, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harris said the disease isolates people, often leading to patients giving up driving, reading or other things they once loved. She said she gave up watching movies in theaters alone by age 12 because it was so difficult and stressful to navigate with reduced vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Leonard said the research has implications for various eye diseases. And new treatments using the technique are being developed for the leading cause of blindness -- macular degeneration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's exciting," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harris said she is blessed to have some eyesight at her age, despite the disease, and hopes the research will someday help people who have the same disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She envisions a stunning future: "I can see lightning bugs again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with much research under way, this is basic research that will take many years before it can be translated into treatments for diseases.</p>

Put on a few pounds, have you? We usually don’t pay much attention to various rankings of America’s cit- ies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever category it is — healthi- est, most dangerous, most livable, etc., etc. — the data usually are bogus and St. Louis doesn’t fare well. But the May edition of Men’s Health magazine, which ranks America’s “Fat- test Cities” according to a half-dozen statistical methods, ranks St. Louis right in the middle. At No. 49, St. Louis is given a “C” grade. This is pretty good, considering our basic diet of Budweiser, frozen cus- tard, toasted ravioli and pork steaks. We’re a little worried about our friends in Kansas City, though. They live in the sixth-fattest city in America, according to Men’s Health. They got an “F.” Maybe lay of the barbecue and Winstead cheeseburgers for a while and try a salad with a little light vinaigrette, OK? America’s least-fat cities? San Fran- cisco and Burlington, Vt. Five of the fattest cities in America were in Texas, with Corpus Christi ranked as the fat- test. People in Corpus apparently have special religious dietary laws. We once saw a sign outside a restaurant there advertising “Christian-owned chicken- fried steak.” YOUR VIEWS • LETTERS FROM OUR READERS Mo. Legislature should not increase costs to businesses Missouri Auditor Susan Montee and the Post-Dispatch missed a few important details in propos- ing that the state discontinue compensating Missouri retailers for collecting and remitting sales taxes collected from customers. The editorial “A good time to close the ‘timely’ loophole” (April 19) called the discount a “loop- hole.” Let’s call this efort what it really is: an attempt to raise tax revenue on the backs of Missouri employers. Missouri’s small retailers, who would be hit hardest by this pro- posal, know that there is a real cost in collecting and remitting sales tax for the state. Ms. Montee char- acterized that process as “a simple push of a button,” misrepresenting the efort and expense that goes into the tax collection. To comply with tax collection requirements, businesses must assume the cost of training personnel, purchasing equipment and software, pro- gramming register systems, docu- menting tax-exempt sales, han- dling audits and appeals, preparing forms and collecting and remitting the tax. The cost to collect is even more burdensome when inter- change fees are considered. Every time a debit or credit card is used, at least 2 percent is taken of the total price of the sale, including sales tax. In reality, the 2 percent deduc- tion allowed by Missouri doesn’t cover the actual costs to busi- nesses, no matter how large. A nonpartisan study by Pric ater- houseCoopers showed substantial costs to businesses collecting the tax. The average cost was more than 3 percent of the tax collected, and in the case of some smaller retailers (between $150,000 and $1 million in sales), the costs ex- ceeded 13 percent. Compliance costs alone for Missouri’s largest retailers (more than $10 million in sales) averaged more than 2 per- cent in most retail sectors. It is ironic that Ms. Montee does not believe business should be compensated for part of their costs to collect taxes when the state col- lects up to 3 percent of local taxes they collect and distribute back to political subdivisions — after the businesses collect the tax for them. The state’s systems should be more sophisticated than a small Missouri retailer that has one or two employees. This issue was debated at length in the 2003 and 2004 legislative sessions and defeated. When Mis- souri retailers are doing everything they can to keep their doors open, lawmakers should avoid increasing their costs. Daniel P. Mehan • Jefferson City President and CEO, Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry In climate change discussion, money talks It is not surprising that <span class="companylink">Peabody Energy</span>CEO Gregory Boyce wants “more scientific study” before action is taken on climate change (“Coal chiefs accept warming, but ...” April 15). More review means more time before his industry will have to start reducing its harmful pollution. The tobacco industry used the same tactic decades ago to fi ght the clear scientific evi- dence that smoking causes cancer. Years of study by thousands of independent researchers around the world, as synthesized by the United Nations-sponsored Inter- governmental Panel on Climate Change, paint a clear picture of the stark reality: Climate change is happening now, and human activity is causing it. According to a study by Naomi Oreskes of the University of California at San Diego, of all the peer-reviewed research on climate change, not a single scientific article concluded otherwise. Dissenting voices exist at the margins, but they simply are not supported by the scientific ev- idence and are not given credence by the scientific community. Most disturbingly, these voices often can be linked to fi nancial interests in industries that will lose money if action is taken to reduce climate change, presenting a clear conflict of interest. We still can head of the worst efects of climate change by us- ing energy more eiciently and deploying clean-energy technolo- gies. Delay is not an option. We need to start now. Sonya Bahar • St. Louis Associate Professor of Biophysics and Director, Center for Neurodynamics, University of Missouri-St Louis Carl M. Bender • St. Louis Professor of Physics, Washington University Robert Elgin • University City Retired energy analyst Consequences of cutting benefits Regarding “Budget cutters target pensions” (April 19): Senate Bill 714 and others that cut into the heart of benefits for state work- ers will have an impact on all state workers — not just for new hires after January 2011. Sen. Jason Crowell, R-Cape Girardeau, who sponsored the bill, and those who vote the bill through have not thought about what this does to state services. The bill modifies provisions relating to retirement for state worker who are hired after Jan. 1, 2011. New state employees would be required to put 4 percent of their earning into a retirement fund. The age of retirement went up. And to be vested, employees will have to work for 10 years in- stead of fi ve years. Missouri’s employees are the lowest-paid state worker in the nation. We work for the state be- cause of the benefits. Consider a nurse’s aide who makes $930 every two weeks. Take out $140 in taxes, $130.00 out for health insurance for the employee and a spouse, and then take out 4 percent for the retirement. The aide went from making $10 an hour to about $7 an hour. We have been told there would be no raises this year. Because of the budget they are taking two of our holidays away. We face re- taliation for using sick time. The work load has increased and we get treated as if we have no rights at all. And the state wants to take more away from us. The consequence is that we will be in line with private-sector, which will include high turnover. With few people willing to work for the state, positions will go un- fi lled, increasing the work load on others. What does this mean to the public? We take care of the vet- erans, our solders, your loved ones. We take care of the mentally handicapped, your loved ones. We take care of the mentally incompe- tent and keep them of the streets, to keep you safe. The list of state services goes on. The state needs us and we need our benefits to keep staing lev- els appropriate. Why work for the state when we can work for minimum wage anywhere and get treated with respect and as a per- son with rights. Kay Wofford • Rolla, Mo. Seeing is believing in venture philanthropy More than 10 million Americans are afected by diseases that cause blindness. Alarmingly, that num- ber is expected to increase 50 per- cent by 2020. In neighborhoods across St. Louis, people of all ages are meeting the challenges of life with blinding diseases. Now, for the fi rst time, there is hope for restored vision for people afected by retinal diseases. Recently published results from a breakthrough study, funded in part by the Foundation Fighting Blindness, show that gene therapy restored significant vision in fi ve children and seven adults who were blind because of retinitis pig- mentosa, a blinding genetic dis- ease that afects people from birth. By injecting a missing gene directly into the back of the eye, patients experienced dramatic improve- ments in visual acuity, peripheral vision and light sensitivity. One of the trial’s youngest par- ticipants, a 9-year-old boy, has witnessed some of the most strik- ing results, regaining the ability to ride his bike, play baseball and read the chalkboard in class. When asked what was best about his restored vision, his response was “colors.” With a variety of clinical trials ongoing, this breakthrough sets the stage for the use of gene therapy in many more retinal dis- eases moving forward, with hope for further success. This trial would not have been possible without the essential fi nancial support provided by the Foundation Fighting Blindness and other funding organizations. Non-profit organizations often provide the start-up venture phi- lanthropy capital necessary to be- gin new research not funded by the government. With federal funding for medical research limited to supporting studies with proven results, unexplored research re- ceives little or no funding. The potential for new break- through research can be limited by a lack of initial funding. However, money provided through venture philanthropy allows scientists to investigate uncharted territory. In essence, venture philanthropy funding can drive research until it gets funding from federal sources, such as the National Institutes of Health. Each of us has the opportunity to play a pivotal role in such ven- ture philanthropy, whether by investing our time as volunteers or our dollars as funders. Our involvement and dedication to non-profit organizations that of- fer support for medical research is critical. Now more than ever, supporting early research can sig- nificantly improve the lives of our neighbors, friends and families to- day and for generations to come. Jack Wiedmer • St. Louis President, Foundation Fighting Blindness St. Louis Chapter Same result — drunk or distracted The April 17 edition was quite the paper. An Illinois state trooper drives 126 miles per hour while on his cell phone and kills two people, and he gets a sentence of 30 months of probation, what- ever that means (“No prison for trooper”). A truck driver kills three people because he was distracted, and he serves one year in jail (“Trucker in wreck that killed 3 is freed”). Why do the innocent die and the guilty walk away with a slap on the wrist? I suppose if the trooper or the truck driver had been drunk, the penalties would have been more severe. But does it matter if the drivers are drunk or sober when the results are the same? Ken Durbin • Florissant Work safe I share in the grief for the West Virginia miners killed in an explo- sion earlier this month. I couldn’t help but notice the deafening silence where the strong voice of the United Mine Workers once was heard. The facts were undeniable: The Upper Big Branch Mine was cited for more than 500 violations in 2009, but it received nothing more than a monetary slap on the wrist. The fi ne, about $160,000, repre- sented mere minutes of company profits. I can’t help but think that if it were a union mine, the union would have had it shut down be- cause of unsafe conditions. There is no question in my mind that 29 families would not be mourning loved ones and those communities would not have endured trauma and tragedy if it had been a union mine. Everyone who works for wages owes a debt of gratitude to unions for their hard-fought gains, in- cluding eight-hour work days, 40- hour work weeks, overtime pay, health care benefits, child labor laws and Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. Unions set standards for equi- table, safe work environments and establishing a standard of living that created the middle class. The erosion of the middle class is a di- rect result of the assault on unions. Without unions, more people may lose their lives — and more will lose their ability to safely earn a fair living wage. Supporting unions is in everyone’s best inter- est. Catherine Mikolay • Fults, Ill. Make it a home run For several years now, our fam- ily has been participating in the Catholic Charities program “Go to Bat for the Kids. ” The public donates to Catholic Charities spe- cifically to buy a Cardinals game ticket for an underprivileged child to see what might be his or her only live Cardinals game. The fi rst few years we donated, the letter said each child would get a hot dog and soda. For a child, that is part of the fun. But, in re- cent years, the letter did not men- tion the hot dog and soda. I called to inquire and was told that the Cardinals had to cut back, so there would be no more free food and drink for the kids. After reading “Legislators sit pretty at ballpark” (April 11), it is apparent why the disadvantaged children no longer get a hot dog and soda at Cardinals games. It seems that the underprivileged kids are losing out to public of- fi cials who get free tickets and a bufet in one of the team’s party rooms. The public oicials could aford the tickets and food. The Cardinals should make it a real home run for these kids and provide the free hot dog and soda on Catholic Charities night (which is June 4 this year). R.J.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mar. 19--A long-sought holy grail of medicine, gene therapy seems to be reversing a form of childhood blindness, and other genome-based treatments might not be far behind, the director of the National Eye Institute told an Augusta conference Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Paul A. Sieving, who also does research on the genetics of eye diseases, spoke at the second annual retreat of the Vision Discovery Institute of the Medical College of Georgia, one of several discovery institutes at the school that join clinical researchers and basic scientists in the hopes of creating breakthroughs. It is something the national institute encourages, Sieving said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It really has to be an exchange, a community of people working on it," he said. "Hence, the really critical importance of the Vision Discovery Institute."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more than 600 genes now identified that have been linked to eye diseases, vision researchers are poised to take full advantage of the wealth of genetic research, Sieving said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a gold mine for discovery, a gold mine for work," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the first payoffs with gene therapy involves a relatively rare cause of blindness known as Leber congenital amaurosis. Patients with a certain form of that disease have a mutated copy of a gene called RPE65 that codes for an enzyme used to convert vitamin A to give the eye light sensitivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You restore the gene, you restore the enzyme function and everything starts to run again," Sieving said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy to add a working copy of RPE65 in three young adults with the mutation appears to have restored some vision within weeks, and it was still functioning a year later, according to reports in The New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This really has caught the attention of the entire gene therapy community for all disease in the country," Sieving said. "Next week, when (National Institutes of Health Director) Francis Collins testifies to Congress, he's going to tell Congress about this. The vision community is on the map because we have great systems and great science."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That probably is going to be the first series of genetic therapy breakthroughs," said Dr. Julian Nussbaum, the chairman of MCG's Department of Ophthalmology and co-director of the discovery institute. "So you can see one gene, one protein, one treatment. You replace the protein by replacing the gene."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the wealth of genetic information grows and genome sequencing becomes cheaper, with $1,000 individual genomes coming soon, it will transform medicine, Sieving said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is now going to reach right into our eye clinics because we are going to think about disease differently," he said. "It is this kind of analysis that is going to cause us to rename disease, rethink how disease works, and ultimately will lead us to treating patients in new ways."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Instead of treating the disease in general, (medicine) is moving towards treating the disease specific to your genetic profile," Nussbaum said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she came to MCG from the national institute 18 years ago, clinicians and scientists didn't mix much, said Dr. Sylvia Smith, a basic science co-director of the discovery institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There wasn't any way for us to work together," she said. Now, eight joint projects are under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is very exciting," Smith said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nov. 4--V INTON -- Holly Lindauer doesn't have time to sit around and feel sorry for herself. The stay-at-home mom of four children, including a son with special needs, is dealing with a blinding disease -- retinitis pigmentosa -- which causes her eyesight to slowly deteriorate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her 5-year-old son, Luke, has vision problems as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is also deaf and moderately mentally disabled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family's faith keeps things in perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I believe things happen for a reason," Lindauer says. "I have learned about disabilities and been able to help other families." Lindauer, 33, wants to raise awareness of all retinal diseases. Last month she organized a VisionWalk in Des Moines to raise funds for the Foundation Fighting Blindness, a group researching gene therapy to restore sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although held in other states, this was the first VisionWalk in Iowa. While the reaction was primarily positive, Lindauer did receive a few "nasty grams" from those who believe blindness should be dealt with and accepted rather than cured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some don't look at it like a disability, but as a way of life," she says. "I have found ways to get around blindness, but would love for people to have a chance to restore their sight." Despite cold and snowy conditions the day of the walk, the effort raised more than $14,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"During these hard times, people still donated," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She doesn't know if she will eventually completely lose her sight, but she wants children with vision problems to have a chance to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The reason I do these things is more for Luke than me," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luke began to have seizures in 2004 when he was 4 months old. He suffered brain damage and lost his hearing and most of his sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Lindauer's youngest child, Rebekah, was born in 2005, she noticed she was losing her sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors tested her for neurological problems at first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They thought I had a brain tumor," she says. "It was almost a relief to find out it was only my vision and not a brain tumor." The disease is a genetic disorder that was probably present her entire life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It doesn't appear in women right away," she says. "I think pregnancies make it go down hill faster." She has worn glasses since she was about 2 years old and has had difficulties determining colors, but her eyesight didn't affect her day-to-day activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, she lost her driver's license due to her poor eyesight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When I realized it, it seemed all of a sudden," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the testing and diagnosis, she felt she didn't have time to worry about herself while Luke needed so much attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the summer of 2008, Luke's needs became too much for the family, and Holly and her husband, Tom, decided to enroll him in ChildServ in Des Moines, an assisted living center serving special-needs children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He was a 4-year-old child with a 1 1/2-year-old's brain," Lindauer says. "He couldn't be entertained and would just run around like a wild man." The stress hospitalized Lindauer with depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also took its toll on their other children, Isaac, 8, Noah, 6, and Rebekah, 4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The other kids didn't get any attention," Lindauer says. "When Luke left, they went through a 'woo-hoo, now we can be horrible' stage." But living with Luke has given his siblings a better understanding of people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They always know not to make fun of other children because Luke is one of those children," Lindauer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dealing with challenges has brought the family together, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We do everything any other family does, it just takes longer and more thought," she says. "I think who we are is who we are supposed to be."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Tuesday about an experimental gene therapy procedure intended to improve vision misstated the name of a gene used in a treatment of five children and seven adults with a type of congenital retinal disease. It is RPE65, not REP65.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sat Nov 07 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Corey Haas was 7, the retinal disease he was born with had already stolen much of his vision. ''He always clung to me or my wife,'' said Corey's father, Ethan Haas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boy relied on a cane and adults to guide him, and, unable to see blackboard writing, sat in back with a teacher's aide, large-type computer screen and materials in Braille.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legally blind, Corey was expected eventually to lose all sight. Then, 13 months ago, after his eighth birthday, he underwent an experimental gene therapy procedure, receiving an injection in his left eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His vision in that eye improved quickly. Now 9, Corey plays Little League baseball, drives go-carts, navigates wooded trails near his home in Hadley, N.Y., and reads the blackboard in class. ''It's gotten, like, really better,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts in vision problems say that while it is unclear how many visually impaired people gene therapy could help, they consider the research promising for some types of blinding diseases, and an achievement for gene therapy, which has had many setbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, reported in the journal Lancet, involved five children and seven adults, from Belgium, Italy and the United states, with a type of Leber's congenital amaurosis, rare but serious congenital retinal diseases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers injected into the eyes of the patients a virus with the normal version of the gene REP65 inserted into its genome. When the virus invaded the light-sensing cells in the eye and inserted its own DNA into the cells' DNA, the crucial human gene was included.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting at about two weeks, ''all 12 had significant improvement,'' said Stephen Rose, chief research officer at the Foundation Fighting Blindness, which helped finance the study. That meant the inserted gene was functioning. ''You're not returning 20-20 vision, let's be real,'' Dr. Rose said, ''but you're returning a tremendous amount of vision.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Jean Bennett, an ophthalmology professor at University of Pennsylvania who was a leader of the study, said participants could ''read signs or see numbers on their cellphones, stripes on their clothes, patterns on furniture, wood on a violin or marble on a table.'' Some read several more lines on eye charts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children improved the most, perhaps because fewer photoreceptors had decayed. But even the oldest patient, Tami Morehouse, 44, who was sometimes housebound, now walks to meet her children coming from school and ''saw her daughter hit a home run,'' Dr. Bennett said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a burst of new research on restoring sight, gene therapy is one of the methods closest to achieving results, but it will not help everyone because some eye diseases destroy photoreceptor cells, which are crucial for allowing gene therapy to work. Also, specific genes must be identified for different strains of diseases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Gene therapy is great, but it's going to work only when patients have viable photoreceptor cells,'' said Dr. Gerald Chader, chief scientific officer at Doheny Retina Institute in Los Angeles, who was not involved in the study. ''There's a great limitation on the number of patients.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Rose said the number helped might be greater than previously thought, because some patients had ''islands of live photoreceptors'' where gene therapy might restore partial sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Katherine High, another study leader, who heads the Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said that in the future, the researchers might inject 3-year-olds, and then 6-month-olds, ultimately in both eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That would give you the best chance of salvaging as much visual function as possible,'' Dr. High said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiment succeeded in part because the body did not mount an immune response that destroyed the invading virus. Dr. Bennett said she believed that was because ''the eye itself is enclosed'' and ''protected from the blood supply,'' so the injected compound ''doesn't escape.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. High said that, while researchers expected visual improvement to plateau after about eight weeks, ''many people report continuing improvement,'' suggesting their brains might be continually adjusting to the new visual pathways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not appropriate for us to call this a cure because we don't know how long it will last,'' she said. ''But it's certainly a reversal of the blindness.''</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small but provocative study showed that a form of gene therapy significantly improved the vision of patients left legally blind by a rare genetic eye disease. The benefit was especially striking among children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers said the findings amount to an important advance toward medicine's ambitious but generally unrealized dream of replacing disease-causing mutant or missing genes with normal DNA to treat and cure debilitating illnesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the study, 12 patients, including four children between ages 8 and 11 years old, underwent a surgical procedure in which a gene that makes a protein critical to vision function was injected into one eye. The second eye wasn't treated. While normal sight wasn't restored in any of the patients, all reported some improvement. Six gained enough vision that they may no longer meet criteria for being legally blind, researchers said, including the four children for whom substantial recovery of vision appears to have transformed their lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The children "were using Braille" in school before they were treated with the gene therapy, said Katherine A. High, co-lead investigator for the study. "Now they're reading books."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. High is director of the center for cellular and molecular therapeutics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the main sponsor of the study. She and colleagues from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine are presenting the results at a meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology that begins this weekend in San Francisco. The study is also being published online Saturday by the medical journal the Lancet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much more needs to be learned about the safety of the treatment, its durability and other factors. But so far, improvement in vision has persisted as long as two years after a single treatment without evidence of significant adverse side effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the long-term goals of gene therapy is to develop medicines you can take off the shelf and inject into a patient--medicine in a bottle," said Dr. High, who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. "This is an example of where that has worked. That's a big step forward for the field."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patients in the study suffered from a condition called Leber's congenital amaurosis. It is marked by a mutation in a gene known as RPE65 which results in a missing enzyme that leads to degradation of the retina and the disruption of vision processing in the brain. About 3,000 Americans are affected, of whom between 6% and 16% have the type of disease that affects patients in the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patients have significant visual impairment beginning in infancy. They typically lack peripheral vision, have low sensitivity to light and have rapid eye movement that prevents their ability to focus on specific objects. The disease progresses slowly so that most are totally blind by the time they're in their 30s or early 40s. There aren't any effective treatments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report builds on encouraging findings from a preliminary study by many of the same researchers involving three of the patients--all young adults--that drew wide attention when it was published in 2008 along with a similar study by another research team. Those results proved safe enough to prompt researchers to include children in the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a slowly progressive disease and there is less and less function" of the retina as people age, said Jean Bennett, professor of ophthalmology at University of Pennsylvania and senior author of the study. "Part of the challenge is to capture the right window of opportunity" for treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bennett and her husband Albert M. McGuire, an eye surgeon at Penn, developed the treatment over two decades of research. Dr. McGuire, co-lead author of the study, performed the procedure to inject the gene therapy in all of the patients in the study. The treatment, manufactured at a facility at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, involves a genetically engineered version of the RPE65 gene, which is put in the shell of an inactivated virus known as an adeno-associated virus. It is injected under the retina of the eye while the patient is under general anesthesia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corey Haas, now 9, is one participant who benefited markedly from the approach. Before he was treated 13 months ago, he sat in the back of the class at school with a large computer screen and a teacher's aide to help him see class materials. Now he sits at the front of the class and can see the chalk board and other content without the assistance of a computer or an aide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a video taken by researchers, Corey is shown struggling to negotiate an obstacle course when he wears a patch over his treated eye; when the patch is moved to his untreated eye, he moves quickly through the course. "That was a dramatic improvement," said Dr. High.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another boy, from Belgium, likes to participate in races during field days at his school. But, before he was treated, he required a teacher to run with him to enable him to stay on the course. He always finished last, Dr. High said. After the gene therapy, he ran the course on his own and finished fifth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results were striking enough that researchers had to step in to prevent social-service agencies from canceling benefits to some of the patients and their families. "That would be our ultimate dream," said Dr. Bennett, that patients would improve so as to no longer need benefits, "but this is an experiment. We hope this will last for a lifetime, but we don't know."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the next steps is to perform the treatment on even younger patients. "In the definitive form of this treatment, you would imagine being able to diagnose a child very early in life," said Edwin Stone, an eye researcher and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at University of Iowa in Iowa City. "Then you could give treatment so their visual pathways would develop normally."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stone is a co-author on the current study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another step is to treat both eyes in afflicted patients. Every patient in the study has asked for the procedure on their other eye, something researchers say is possible when they gain more confidence about the treatment's safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ethan Haas, Corey's father, is eager for that opportunity. Before the initial treatment, Corey tended to cling to his parents; he could ride his bicycle, but only very near the house and with his father's help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, he can ride his bicycle by himself around his upstate New York neighborhood. He plays soccer. "Just his total independence and his attitude toward doing things has changed a lot," says Mr. Haas, who is an electrician at <span class="companylink">International Paper Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Haas learned something else he hadn't previously known about his son. Before the treatment, the boy's pupils were so dilated they "looked like an owl," he says. One day out raking leaves after the treatment, Mr. Haas noticed the pupils were constricted as they adjusted to the light. He saw that Corey's eyes were blue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Wow," he says, "I'd never seen that before."</p>

</div><div class="author">THE LOS ANGELES TIMES  </div><div>668 words</div><div>26 October 2009</div><div>Charleston Gazette</div><div>CGAZ</div><div>P9A</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright 2009)  </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pennsylvania researchers using gene therapy have made significant improvements in vision in 12 patients with a rare inherited visual defect, a finding that suggests it may be possible to produce similar improvements in a much larger number of patients with retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team last year reported success with three adult patients, an achievement that was hailed as a major accomplishment for gene therapy. They have now treated an additional nine patients, including five children, and find that the best results are achieved in the youngest patients, whose defective retinal cells have not had time to die off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The youngest patient, 9-year-old Corey Haas, was considered legally blind before the treatment began. He was confined largely to his house and driveway when playing, had immense difficulties in navigating an obstacle course and required special enlarging equipment for books and help in the classroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, after a single injection of a gene-therapy product in one eye, he rides his bike around the neighborhood, needs no assistance in the classroom, navigates the obstacle course quickly and has even played his first game of softball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results are "astounding," said Stephen Rose, chief scientific officer of the Foundation Fighting Blindness, which supported the work but was not involved directly. "The big take-home message from this is that every individual in the group had improvement . . . and there were no safety issues at all."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study "holds great promise for the future" and "is appealing because of its simplicity," wrote researchers from the Nijmegen Medical Center in the Netherlands in an editorial accompanying the report, which was published online Saturday by the journal Lancet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12 patients suffered from Leber's congenital amaurosis, which affects about 3,000 people in the United States and perhaps 130,000 worldwide. Victims are born with severely impaired vision that deteriorates until they are totally blind, usually in childhood or adolescence. There is no treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leber's is a good candidate for gene therapy because most of the visual apparatus is intact, particularly at birth and in childhood. Mistakes in 13 genes are known to cause it, but all 12 of the patients suffered a defect in a gene called RPE65. This gene produces a vitamin A derivative that is crucial for detecting light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About five children are born each year in the United States with that specific defect, which was chosen because researchers at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine had cloned the gene, making copies available for use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, led by Dr. Katherine A. High, Dr. Albert M. Maguire and Dr. Jean Bennett of those two institutions, enrolled five people in the United States, five from Italy and two from Belgium. Five were children, and the oldest was 44.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good copy of the RPE65 gene was inserted into a defanged version of a human adenovirus. The engineered virus then invaded retinal cells and inserted the gene into the cells' DNA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maguire used a long, thin, hollow needle to insert the preparation into the retina of the worst eye in each of the patients. Within two weeks, the treated eyes began to become more sensitive to light, and within a few more weeks, vision began to improve. The younger the patients were, the better they responded. That was expected, Bennett said, because similar results had been observed in dogs and rodents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By both objective and subjective measures, all the patients' vision improved. They were able to navigate obstacle courses, read eye charts and perform most of the tasks of daily living. The improvement has now persisted for as long as two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bennett noted that the oldest patient in the trial, a mother, had not been able to walk down the street to meet her children at school. "Now she can. She also achieved her primary goal, which was to see her daughter hit a home run."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Tom Avril   </div><div>Inquirer Staff Writer</div>
<div>1139 words</div><div>25 October 2009</div><div>The Philadelphia Inquirer</div><div>PHLI</div><div>CITY-C</div><div>A01</div><div>English</div><div>(c) Copyright 2009, Philadelphia Newspapers. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corey Haas used to need a high schooler to accompany him on the soccer field, to point out where the ball was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whenever the 9-year-old played with his Lego blocks, he had to feel around for them. At school in Upstate New York, he needed the help of a teacher's aide and a special computer screen to display class materials in giant size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not anymore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year and a half after reporting that it could restore some vision to young adults who have a rare form of blindness, a team of Philadelphia researchers announced yesterday that its gene therapy works even better in children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twelve patients, the oldest one 44, received an injection of corrective genes in one eye to replace the malfunctioning genes they were born with. Corey, the youngest of the 12 when he was treated last year, saw some of the biggest improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His treated eye became 10,000 times more sensitive to light, as measured by the pupil's ability to constrict, said the University of Pennsylvania's Jean Bennett, senior author of the findings, published in the Lancet. The eyes of the adults became hundreds of times more sensitive, at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All 12 experienced at least some visual gains in the trial, done in collaboration with Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. None is close to having normal eyesight. But depending on how the term is defined, several, including Corey, are no longer legally blind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results are one of the few successes thus far in the young field of gene therapy, though the pace is starting to accelerate. Two other teams of researchers, one of them led by Penn's Samuel G. Jacobson, have reported improvements in patients with the same form of blindness - Leber's congenital amaurosis. Elsewhere, physicians have had some success in alleviating symptoms of Parkinson's disease by injecting genes into the brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still others are removing defective bone-marrow cells, adding new genes, and reinserting the cells to tackle an inherited immune deficiency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For various reasons, treating genetic defects that affect other parts of the body will be even more challenging, said Michel Sadelain, director of the Center for Cell Engineering at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Still, the new eye study is promising, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The results are superb," said Sadelain, who was not involved with the study. "This is extremely encouraging for the field in general."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corey's parents first had a clue that the therapy was working just three or four days after the surgery, performed by Bennett's husband, Albert Maguire. On a sunny day at the zoo, the boy suddenly said it was too bright, recalled his mother, Nancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference at Children's Hospital on Thursday, she began to cry as she said that in the old days, "he never said that. Wow."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corey now rides his bike in the street near the family's home in Hadley, N.Y., and he can see well enough to hit underhand pitches in Little League, said his father, Ethan. Before the surgery, they thought baseball was too dangerous for a boy who could barely see the ball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'd be scared of having to go see the dentist," Corey's father said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corey is able to see colors better, so much so that on one occasion, he mistakenly thought one of his playmates had started to dye her hair a brighter hue. Corey's ability to read letters on an eye chart did not improve, as it did for some of the 12 patients, but he already had been among the best of the bunch at that task, scoring about 20/200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children experienced greater improvements in light sensitivity because Leber's congenital amaurosis is a progressive disease, said Stephen M. Rose, chief research officer at the nonprofit Foundation Fighting Blindness, which helped fund the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patients' retinal cells deteriorate more as they get older, so younger people have more viable cells to rescue, he said. That was why the Penn-Children's trial was initially limited to those 27 and younger; expectations for patients in their 20s were low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even those patients, including 26-year-old twins from Italy, improved more than the researchers expected. So the team expanded the trial to a 35-year-old and a 44-year-old, who experienced modest improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People with the disease have a mutation in a specific gene, a flawed recipe that prevents their bodies from making a protein essential for converting light signals into something the brain can recognize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trial, which cost more than $2 million, has been more than a decade in the making. The surgery was tried first on dogs with the same kind of mutation. The first dog, Lancelot, retains his improved vision more than nine years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trying the technique on people was an even bigger step, said Katherine A. High, director of the Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics at Children's Hospital - the study's primary funder. It required layers of government and university scrutiny, and the efforts of dozens of researchers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no training manual," said High, one of the lead authors of the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Always in the back of the mind of any gene therapist is the early tragedy of Jesse Gelsinger, in 1999 at Penn. Gelsinger was injected with viruses that carried therapeutic genes, but he died when the microbes made his immune system go haywire. In the blindness trial, the genes are delivered by a primitive virus that can't make copies of itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional testing of the blindness treatment will follow, and High is hopeful that someday the team will get permission to treat children as young as 3. Meanwhile, researchers intend to use similar genetic techniques to fight other inherited forms of blindness. Some are starting to explore ways to address the most common: macular degeneration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a few years, the Penn-Children's team hopes to seek government approval for its therapy used on Leber's. Eventually, the original 12 patients might have their other eye treated if the therapy wins additional approvals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corey's father said he would be eager to bring the boy back for that. In the meantime, Ethan Haas said, he has to keep his own eyes on the active youngster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once reluctant to play outside, Corey now loves it, his father said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now, it's getting really dark out and it's like, 'Gee, where's Corey?' "</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no warning, no time to prepare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day Chris Miller was reading a goodnight book to her 7-year-old son and the next she was losing her sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was kind of like sunglasses with rain drops on them,” she said, describing her sudden loss of vision in early August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two months later, she is legally blind, the victim of a rare genetic disease that destroys the optic nerve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miller, a 41-year-old mother of three from Edgewater, now is turning to China and an experimental procedure with the hope of salvaging what vision remains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know it won’t come back to 20/20,” she said. “But if I can save enough to see my husband and kids’ faces and keep some independence. . . .”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Images on TV for Miller are now a distorted kaleidoscope of color, and the view from the passenger’s seat of a car is nightmarish, as objects rush by like “big monsters.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only her peripheral vision remains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I can’t see faces,” she said. “I can’t read a story to my son anymore.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of her uncles and a great aunt also went blind from Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, which can wipe out the central vision in both eyes within days or weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miller watched her health, avoiding suspected triggers like cigarettes and caffeine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“She’s a fitness machine. She exercises once or twice a day, and eats only good food,” said her husband, Eddie Miller, head basketball coach at Father Lopez Catholic High School in Daytona Beach. “It’s a cruel disease, in how fast it takes vision away.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being a woman, the odds were in Chris Miller’s favor. While the sole carriers of the gene, far fewer women go blind than men from the disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But somehow it happened to her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rosemarie Frutchey of New Smyrna Beach said the disease has devastated her usually energetic and upbeat daughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“She said to me she had to get my (17-year-old) granddaughter’s prom gown now, because ‘I’m not going to be able to see it,’ ” said Frutchey, 65, tears filling her eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disease has touched Frutchey before. Her identical twin brothers both went blind from it — one in two weeks back in 1986 at age 34, and the other in a matter of days in 1997 at age 45.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yes, you can have a DNA test, but do you want to know, when nothing can be done?” she said. “And it (blindness) may never happen.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friends from throughout the area have mobilized, looking to help fund the $30,000 needed for the six spinal stem-cell treatments in China over the course of a month — cells culled from umbilical cords after birth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fund has been established in Chris Miller’s name at <span class="companylink">SunTrust Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proceeds from a recent Father Lopez football game were donated and a golf tournament fundraiser and silent auction are set for Oct. 18 at Hidden Hills Golf Club in New Smyrna Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s estimated that just over 4,000 people in the United States have lost their sight to the disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Mike Makowski, an Ormond Beach ophthalmologist, first diagnosed Miller’s disease in late August, and days later it was confirmed in Miami. It was the first case of Leber’s that Makowski had seen since he was in residency 21 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Chris knew her family history and was concerned she might have the symptoms,” he said. “It was clear” she did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Makowski said no evidence exists yet that stem-cell therapy will help, adding “even the Chinese don’t know,” given the small number of cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The theory with stem cells is reasonable. But whether it will work, we don’t know. There is no guarantee,” he said. “But if Chris didn’t do it, I’m sure she would always wonder if she should have.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only one other American, a 16-year-old girl from California, has undergone the stem-cell treatment in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eddie Miller said he has talked with the high-school girl and she has reported some improvement in her vision since having the procedure in July, six years after losing her central vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said his wife’s case is different.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The (Chinese) doctors are excited because they have never had someone so early in the disease. We were told my wife would have a better chance since she still has live (optic nerve) cells. It might be a big advantage,” he said. “We’re hoping that it slows the progression of the disease enough so she can function.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, researchers in several cities, including Miami, are experimenting with gene therapy, looking for a breakthrough that someday might help people otherwise destined to go blind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It could be the biggest breakthrough for people, including my children,” Chris Miller said. “But I can’t wait four or five years. I don’t have an option to being blind. I have to do what I can.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She longs to see the faces of her children again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO GETS IT: The disease occurs 80 percent of the time in men in their 20s to mid-40s, but can also strike women, the very young and old. The odds of someone with the gene getting the disease are about 50 percent in men and 15 percent in women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW IT AFFECTS PEOPLE: No two people experience the same visual damage. Some patients describe an ever-changing swirl of color. The eyes function normally, but the signal to the brain is not transmitted properly because of the optic nerve damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT IT CAUSES: Loss of central vision within two to eight weeks and usually in both eyes. Patients often maintain some peripheral sight, which allows them to see large objects by not looking at them directly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RESEARCH: In 1988 the disease was discovered to be one of a group of genetic disorders inherited only through the mother. However, it is believed other factors are involved, since not every carrier goes blind.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene Therapy for Colorblindness?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists say they have used gene therapy to enable colorblind monkeys to see red and green, possibly opening the door to curing colorblindness in people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle injected gene-carrying viruses into the retinas of two male squirrel monkeys, which are naturally colorblind. The gene carried instructions for the production of a protein known as opsin, which makes pigments that are sensitive to the colors red and green.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About five weeks after the treatment, the monkeys -- named Dalton and Sam -- began to develop the ability to see those colors, according to an article last week in the journal Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technique could be used to treat colorblind humans, including the estimated 3.5 million people in the United States who have the condition, which primarily affects men.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Rob Stein</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">smf25 wrote:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The implications of this research go far beyond correcting colorblindness. The same methodology, if safe in humans, could correct many nervous system disorders that are due to a single defective gene. This is an amazing "proof of concept" for genetic engineering in the central nervous system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Lunchables Are 'Wholesome'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kraft has added a line of "wholesome" Lunchables to its repertoire. The turkey and cheddar sub, for example, features "spring water" and applesauce, "bread made with whole grain," "turkey made with 100% turkey breast," plus 2 percent milk reduced-fat cheddar cheese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I invite you to scan the ingredients. Kraft has managed to turn a simple turkey and cheese sandwich into a chemistry set. Just reading the list of ingredients -- I stopped counting at 119 -- is exhausting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And about that "bread made with whole grain": Is that the white wheat bran that appears far down the list of the bread's ingredients, long after the "enriched bleached wheat flour"? Or the malted barley flour, added to baked goods mainly to keep them soft and moist? Or the wheat germ, of which the bread contains 2 percent or less?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My kids are 6, 7 and 8 and I've heard their cry for Lunchables many times. What we've done is create our own "Lunchables" with healthy turkey, cheese, crackers and fruit. We make the lunches together, and that seems to take some of the sting out of not having the coolest lunch at school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">drmary wrote:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the "wholesome" label causes parents to buy Lunchables rather than sending <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> or money for chips, I can live with that. I know . . . folks are not going to be making home lunches no matter what.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could Down Syndrome Disappear?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the unsettling and provocative question posed in an article in the Archives of Disease in Childhood. The study reports that, in the absence of prenatal testing, scientists would have expected a 34 percent increase in the number of babies born with the syndrome between 1989 and 2005. Instead, 15 percent fewer were born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As new blood tests allow for noninvasive screening during the first trimester of pregnancy (as opposed to amniocentesis, which is administered well after a woman's pregnancy has become evident to others), more women who learn that they are carrying a fetus that will develop Down syndrome might opt to terminate their pregnancies, according to the study. As it stands, 92 percent of women in that situation opt to abort. More than 400,000 people in the United States have Down syndrome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Jennifer LaRue Huget</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">anti-elitist wrote:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My wife and I had the option of having the amniocentesis but decided it was a waste and too risky, as the results would not have made a difference of whether or not we would carry the baby full term. At some level, those who opt for the test are more likely to abort based on unfavorable results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, Down syndrome has varying levels of affliction, and an amniocentesis does not provide the parents with knowledge of how severely their child will have the disease. Many who have the condition lead capable, happy, rich lives that would have otherwise had been taken away had they been aborted.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WORCESTER - David Schwarte has been legally blind since birth. His life is not completely enveloped in darkness, as he can see through "a little patch of light at the corner of my eye." To him, colors are washed out, shapes are blurry. He walks with a long cane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born with a rare genetic disorder called Leber Congenital Amaurosis, Mr. Schwarte, of West Lafayette, Ind., had few options for treatment until recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through a clinical trial being conducted at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, 12 people with LCA are undergoing surgery to have a malfunctioning gene in their eye replaced with a normal gene. It is the only clinical trial of its kind in New England, one of only a handful being conducted nationwide. While the procedure is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the first phase of trials established that the procedure is safe. The trial is sponsored by Applied Genetic Technologies Corp. of Gainesville, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hoped that the trial will lead to a treatment for the estimated 20,000 to 40,000 people worldwide who have LCA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schwarte has been coming to Worcester regularly since July, when he had the surgery. So far, he has seen a slight improvement in his peripheral vision, and that sight is slowly moving toward the center of his eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm still in the healing stage," he said recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Shalesh Kaushal, who joined the medical school in January as its chair of ophthalmology, described the vision of people with LCA as seeing shapes and shadows, as having most colors washed out. People with LCA typically lose their vision in the first months of their lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A cloudy day for most people would be like sitting in a darkened movie theater for people with LCA," he said. "And it's a progressive disease, meaning they will continue to lose their sight over time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that gene therapy, once it has been sufficiently tested, may one day be available to address any number of gene-related disorders and diseases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a type of transforming medicine that is made possible by a confluence of a set of events," Dr. Kaushal said. "There is any number of applications possible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason researchers have focused on curing a rare disease such as LCA, he explained, is not because it is the most common but because it is the most treatable. LCA is caused by a mutation within a single gene. Because the gene can be isolated in the eye, it can be manipulated. The exact same type of disease can be found in mice and dogs, giving scientists nonhuman test subjects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final piece was the development of a human virus that does not cause a disease that can be injected - with the corrected gene inside - behind the retina. The virus causes a mild immune response in most patients, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interestingly, said Dr. Kaushal, the retina's lack of an immune response works in its favor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When a foreign substance is introduced into human tissues and cells, it triggers the body's immune system," he said. "Stimulation of the body's immune system can inhibit the effectiveness of gene therapy treatments and, in some cases can have adverse effects on the body and other healthy tissues. However, the retina lacks an immune mechanism, which makes treating eye diseases with gene therapy possible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the virus with the normal gene is delivered behind the patient's retina, the patient's body activates the gene. The gene then begins producing the protein necessary for the rods and cones inside the eye to recognize light. With the malfunctioning gene, LCA patients do not produce enough of this protein, and therefore their eyes do not respond to light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kaushal joined the medical school in January, coming from the University of Florida where he was assistant professor of ophthalmology. He is one of the first researchers in the United States to use gene therapy to treat LCA. At Florida, he and Dr. Terence R. Flotte, now dean of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, had collaborated on earlier clinical trials for this disorder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kaushal is a member of the Gene Therapy Center, part of the Advanced Therapeutics Cluster at the medical school. Research at the center is being applied to diseases such as cystic fibrosis; a genetic lung and liver disorder called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; inherited metabolic disorders such as lysosomal storage disease; a progressive nerve disease called Canavan disease; also eye disorders such as retinal and macular degeneration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During initial clinical trials at the University of Florida, Dr. Kaushal said all of the LCA patients saw improvement in their vision. One patient was able to read the digital clock in her parents' minivan for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I remember one patient taking me aside and saying to me, 'Doctor, I never knew the sky was so blue,'" he said. "That was confirmation to me that we're on the right path."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a simple request, yet a powerful wish for this 10-year-old girl:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"She wishes she could see in the dark," her mother said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, little Chloe has things pretty good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has a twin sister and she loves her jazz, ballet and Irish dance lessons, and has friends everywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things are pretty good. But there's hope that they could eventually even be a lot better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chloe Lanteigne-Marrow has retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease in which the cells of her retinas slowly die, gradually robbing her of her sight. For now, she has no night vision and little peripheral vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means that she stumbles at times, that her range of vision is limited -- and that doctors recommend she not play soccer, which she really wants to do. She'd be too vulnerable, not able to see flying balls and players coming at her from one side or the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also means this:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That she'll never be able to drive a car ... that she'll need a guide dog by the time she's 40 ... and that she could possibly lose every bit of her sight after that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So her family, who lives in East York's Elmwood neighborhood, wanted to do something about making a good life better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, they found some hope at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, which has benefited from cutting-edge gene therapy research at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mutated genes from blind children are being replaced with genes from eye donors -- and, miraculously, some of the kids who never saw anything before are now seeing everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chloe's blood is being analyzed now in Estonia to locate her mutated genes and possibly start this procedure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This hope is a blessing, especially when other doctors were telling her not to ever expect any kind of successful treatment or cure for her disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A blessing for sure, but Chloe's family also knows that these researchers need money to finance their work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Chloe's mom, Holly Lanteigne-Marrow, decided to tell their story at a Shiloh Lions' Club meeting and knocked everyone out, so to speak. Her goal was to create a fundraising event, and the Lions' Club bought it all and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group decided to raise some money for the cause with a basketball free-throw shooting contest earlier this month, with participants collecting pledges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal was a somewhat modest $1,000. So far, they've raised nearly $5,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chloe's mom also pointed out this: That the gene therapy, though focused on the eyes, could lead to breakthroughs in treating diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, she said. Macular degeneration, which often ruins the eyesight of the elderly, also is a target. For now, C</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Chloe tries to do everything a 10-year-old wants to, like shooting a basketball for the first time at that Lions' Club fundraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mostly, she has fun like everyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, though, she'll feel a bit worn out and frustrated, especially when her eyes never adjust to the dark. Then she'll tell her mom, "I'm tired of not being able to see."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's when they talk about the hope they do have now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No reason to believe that a good life can't become even better, even brighter. Frank Bodani is a sportswriter for the Daily Record/ Sunday News. Reach him at 771-2104 or by e-mail at fbodani@ydr.com</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two decades ago, medicine seemed on the cusp of a revolution. Doctors would soon treat diseases at their very roots, inserting "good" genes to replace patients' faulty ones. Gene therapy was a seductively straightforward idea that offered promise for treating everything from cancer to sickle cell disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But only now, after overcoming unexpected scientific obstacles and the high-profile death of a teenage patient, is gene therapy racking up some clear-cut successes. Promising studies are sending ripples of excitement through the field. Some researchers are daring to use the word cure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yes, we have endured a few more years of questions about gene therapy: Does it really work? Is it really safe?" said Savio Woo, a professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and a past president of the American Society of Gene Therapy. "Now we can show it does work, and it's safe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean that people will be lining up for gene therapy any time soon. No treatments have been approved yet. But researchers are finally pointing to a few inspiring successes, untainted by the kind of tragedy that cast a shadow on the field in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy started the year with a bang: Researchers reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that the technique cured eight of 10 children suffering from usually lethal "bubble boy disease," a lack of immunity that leaves children vulnerable to infections. After two to eight years, all the patients were alive, unlike a previous trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That came on top of an announcement last year that two groups of researchers independently used gene therapy to treat a form of hereditary blindness in a small number of patients, restoring some vision. The evidence, also published in the New England Journal, was presented at a scientific conference in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've never seen [such] a response. ... The audience basically burst into applause, sustained applause, cheering even. It was just amazing," said Sam Wadsworth, group vice president of translational research for <span class="companylink">Genzyme Corp</span>. in Cambridge, which has its own gene therapy program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other studies this month add to the momentum. The journal Nature Medicine, reporting on a trial of 74 HIV patients, said gene therapy had modest but promising effects. A study in the journal Human Gene Therapy reported that two patients with rheumatoid arthritis saw a reduction in pain and swelling with gene therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight-year-old Corey Haas of Hadley, N.Y., received gene therapy for a rare disease called Leber's congenital amaurosis, which was causing him to go blind. His family knew the treatment worked when, soon thereafter, Corey asked his parents when two of his friends changed their hair color. He could finally tell they were blonde, not brunettes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ethan Haas, Corey's father, said the treatment was worth it. "He'll be sitting in the back of the car and say, `I can see the trees go by, and I couldn't see them before,"' Haas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The optimism generated by recent gene therapy advances is a far cry from just a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I reached a point I wouldn't even admit I was doing gene therapy," said Xandra Breakefield, a professor of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital, describing the shadow cast on the field by the death of Jesse Gelsinger, 18, in 1999. He suffered from a genetic liver disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of gene therapy emerged decades ago, as it became clear that scientists could isolate genes and insert them into cells. The first patient was treated with gene therapy in 1990 and since then, hundreds of trials have been conducted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the simple idea of gene therapy came a slew of scientific challenges. Researchers use viruses, which can trigger the body's natural defenses, to deliver genes into cells. Viruses can also insert genes into the wrong place in the genome, potentially causing cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gelsinger died when the viruses used in the experiment triggered a massive immune response that led to his death. With his death came an outpouring of national concern. Some trials were suspended, a Senate hearing was held to examine the need for regulation, and it turned out some clinicians were not properly reporting adverse events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another shadow was cast beginning in 2002, when several children, part of a French trial treating "bubble boy disease," began to develop leukemia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sobered scientific community continued to work on the technology, but with more caution and without the hype.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the time Gelsinger died, Connie Burnett-West, diagnosed with fatal lung cancer and told she had seven months to live, enrolled in a gene therapy trial at the Mary Crowley Cancer Research Center, now in Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is cancer-free today, something she credits to gene therapy. "It looks like to me, in my little nonscientific way, that this might be the wave of the future," said Burnett-West, 63.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has changed since the days of doubt? Over the years, medical knowledge has improved. Researchers understand better how the immune system works and how to reduce the virus risk, in some cases by using a different virus. The tools doctors use are safer and more effective, said Dr. Jean Bennett, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Pennsylvania, who treated hereditary blindness in Corey Haas and others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy "is now having results across different branches of medicine," said Dr. Fabio Candotti, a senior investigator with the National Human Genome Research Institute. "That's what makes you feel some things are beginning to work now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, scientists proceed cautiously. Christopher Evans, a professor of orthopedic surgery at Harvard Medical School who worked on the arthritis trial, said it had been reduced from six patients to two because of an adverse event in an unrelated gene therapy trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second planned trial, he said, has been set back a year because a patient died in a gene therapy arthritis trial led by a Seattle company in 2007, even though that death was not necessarily connected to the therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now one of the biggest challenges for the field may lie in the transition from basic science lab to clinic and eventually to the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Because the medicine is so fundamentally different than what the pharmaceutical industry knows, it's been very difficult to engage the industry," said Richard Mulligan, director of the Harvard Gene Therapy Initiative. "... I think the technology is actually moving very nicely, but what's not been fixed is the interest of the industrial concerns that can really make the stuff happen."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lynette Herman stares into the middle distance while listening to a conversation, occasionally offering up information, correcting her husband's memory or erupting with a sharp burst of laughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is levity in those steel grey eyes, and something else: a malfunction that reaches to the cells lining the back inside wall of the eyes. The mutation of a gene reaching back to at least the turn of the last century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She suffers from retinitis pigmentosa , a disease causing the degeneration of the retina and eventual blindness in some 100,000 Americans. Suffering, though, is not the way Lynette, or her husband, Dr. Martin Herman, would characterize it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While RP robs its carriers of eyesight gradually, usually taking until the age of 40 or so before rendering them legally blind, Lynette is anything but a victim, refusing to lose her positive attitude along with her vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One can't help but notice the beautiful pool table just beyond the living room at the Herman house. Martin says Lynette never played. She, however, insists she did. "I just found out blind people can play golf, too," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to give it a shot," said her husband .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RP is hereditary and can be traced back in her family, originally from Tupelo, Miss., to her great-grandmother, passed to her grandmother and then four of her grandmother's children, including Lynette's father. Her sister, three aunts and uncles and five cousins also have RP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Family reunions are full of people who know to touch when they approach to talk, never to move a chair and to not put a glass of Coke on a dark tablecloth. "I've known about it my whole life and wasn't just hit over the head with it," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diagnosed with the autosomal dominant variation of RP, she was born with a 50/50 chance of having the mutated gene. Lynette, 56, first noticed her fading eyesight as a child with trouble seeing at night, a typical first symptom, eventually needing a pronounced contrast</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">to distinguish objects in her environment as an adult. Her frontal vision is almost totally gone and she can see people and shapes better through her peripheral vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She continued with life as normal until she had to stop driving in her 40s, which, she admits, was probably pushing it. "But," she said, "it didn't affect my life until then. I've had a full life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lynette has been married to Martin , a pediatrics emergency specialist with Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center, for 25 years. The two have one daughter who, at 24, shows no sign of RP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The husband and wife banter, joke and pick at each other's stories. He's helpful, but is in no way a crutch. She doesn't need one, nor would she accept one if offered. Though they walk the neighborhood together; a walking stick is never used, as she is wary of drawing attention to herself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin walks ahead with their dog and calls out only if there is a break in the path or some other obstruction, such as the new street signs the city of Memphis placed in the middle of the sidewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eating out, Martin says, is the most difficult activity, especially any place with mood lighting. "I load up two plates at a buffet. I hope people are understanding."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hermans and Lynette's sister are all on the board of the Mid-South Chapter of Foundation Fighting Blindness (blindness.org), an organization that, according to their mission statement, "drives the research that will provide prevention, treatments and cures for people affected by retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, Usher Syndrome, and the entire spectrum of retinal degenerative diseases."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stephen Rose, a molecular biologist and the foundation's chief research officer, is excited by the prospects of gene therapy and the possibilities of "turning off the bad copy of the gene and getting rid of the toxic product being made." He sees progress at institutions around the country, specifically at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. There three subjects in their late teens and early 20s received gene therapy for Leber congenital amaurosis, an inherited disease causing blindness at birth. Afterward, they were able to read three lines on an eye chart and navigate an obstacle course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hermans, naturally, are hopeful for a cure, or even a halt to the progression into blindness. But the issue isn't dwelt upon. Lynette fills her days with trading stocks online with the help of a <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> feature that switches an Internet browser's page to a high contrast, white characters on a black screen. She could read print up until last year and now downloads books into a digital recorder through a free program with the Library of Congress. She goes through two or three of these per week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She watches DVDs with a special feature that describes a scene aloud as a narrator in a novel might. "I like watching those movies myself," Martin chimes in . She does miss going to the movies, however .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She cooks, she gardens and she researches products that might make her life easier, such as the Cobolt Speechmaster, a device which, when held against fabric such as a shirt or jacket, speaks the color of that item out loud. There are companies, too, working on cell phones with a bar code scanner that will tell the blind all of the information recorded in that code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as helpful as these items are and will be, a cure and good care are the true passions of the Hermans. "Anyone who has eyesight problems should be getting creditable, reliable help," Martin says . "We don't want anyone to have false hopes through unsanctioned, unsafe practices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until a cure comes along, she relies on her knowledge and familiarity with her condition, as well as her sense of humor and her husband, who attributes their long marriage to her blindness: "In her mind I'm still 35, with a head full of hair and no gray."</p>
