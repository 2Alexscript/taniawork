<div id="hd"><b>Won't back down from hog-farm fight - Group plans to challenge province's agriculture rules</b>
</div><div>By Carol Sanders   </div>

</p>
<p>Neighbours of a large hog operation northwest of Winnipeg have hired a lawyer and are preparing to challenge the province's definition of what is "normal" farming practice.</p>
<p>"They're sort of out of step with the times," said Jim McCowan, who farms 450 acres of crops near the Rock Lake Hutterite colony and its hog operation. The Concerned Citizens of Grosse Isle for years have complained about the smell and the number of animals that at times have exceeded the colony's permit.</p>
<p>Complaints to the Farm Practices Protection Board have gotten nowhere, said Bill Massey, chairman of the citizens' group. The board is supposed to review and mediate nuisance disputes and protect farmers operating in a "normal manner" from "nuisance suits."</p>
<p>The citizens group says factory farms and the amount of waste and stink they create are a nuisance that shouldn't be considered normal.</p>
<p>Farms have outgrown the Farm Practices Protection Act that governs them and the regulatory system that's supposed to keep them in check, said McCowan.</p>
<p>"They're going to have to revisit the whole thing," said the man whose family has farmed in the area for close to 40 years.</p>
<p>"Everything is going to get bigger," including the number of hogs, waste and the odour they produce, he said.</p>
<p>In the last five years, the Hutterite colony switched to a liquid-based manure system and built a new barn -- one nearly large enough to hold twice the 889 hogs it is permitted to house. It has seen its hog population climb to more than 1,400, and was ordered by the municipality to reduce the number of animals. Ben Hofer, colony spokesman, said they've obeyed the order and that the municipality has counted the hogs in their barn to make sure.</p>
<p>The neighbours say the colony -- like the whole hog industry -- hasn't been kept in check enough.</p>
<p>The concerned citizens' group has asked the RM of Woodlands to do a count three times a year to make sure the colony keeps to its limit of hogs. The colony and the municipality say that's too much.</p>
<p>"What about biosecurity, with the swine flu and everything?" asked Hofer, who doesn't want more people going in and out of the hog barn.</p>
<p>"They want us to do it all the time and it's costly and time-consuming," said Woodlands Reeve Don Walsh.</p>
<p>Hog farms have to be big to compete and survive, said Walsh: "It's a sign of the times." The Hutterites' hog operation has been around "a lot longer than the ratepayers around it," said Walsh.</p>
<p>He said farms in the RM of Rosser use Winnipeg's human waste on fields, causing a stink in the fall when it is applied and the spring when it thaws.</p>
<p>"People live with it," said Walsh. "It's good fertilizer. But it smells," said the reeve, who lives near a hog farm.</p>
<p>"Whether it's beef animals, hogs, or human waste, we get trouble."</p>
<p>On Oct. 16, the province announced new livestock waste regulations, including a complete ban on winter spreading of manure on Manitoba farms by 2013 and a requirement that all "new" pig producers register manure management plans with the province.</p>
<p>The Concerned Citizens of Grosse Isle say the RM and the Farm Practices Protection Board have let them down.</p>
<p>"What it's come down to is there's nobody out there looking after our interests," said Massey, a retired school principal.</p>
<p>There have been manure spills, an unlicensed human waste lagoon and surface drainage ditch built and times when the colony was housing many more pigs than its permit allowed, said Massey.</p>
<p>"If you want to bend or break the rules, it's a great industry to be in," McCowan said. "The maze of government agencies are reluctant to deal with the situation."</p>
<p>The neighbours are going back to the Farm Practices Protection Board with their complaints, and this time they're taking a lawyer, said Massey.</p>
<p>"We're just trying to get government organizations stepping up to the plate," said McCowan.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Shortness of breath sign of dangerous flu infection</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>514 words</div><div>26 October 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>D7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>As the nation embarks on an unprecedented mass immunization campaign, Canadian doctors consulted by the World Health Organization say shortness of breath is emerging as a hallmark sign of potentially critical H1N1 infection.</p>
<p>Experts have been struggling to understand why what is an uncomplicated illness for most people can be severe or fatal in others, and whether there is any way of predicting who is at risk of becoming critically sick with human swine flu.</p>
<p>Now they believe they have a sign.</p>
<p>"Influenza does a lot of things to a lot of people, but the one thing it should never do to anybody, pretty much, is make you short of breath," said Dr. Anand Kumar, with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, who specializes in the care of critically ill patients.</p>
<p>"That's a danger signal for everybody," Kumar said told Canwest News Service. "If you are short of breath, that means you need urgent assessment by a physician or by the emergency room.</p>
<p>"That would allow therapy early enough to hopefully prevent it from becoming a severe case."</p>
<p>Kumar was among a contingent of Canadian doctors who participated in an expert advisory meeting convened by WHO this month to develop updated guidance documents on the clinical picture and management of H1N1 disease.</p>
<p>Those guidelines are expected to be released this week.</p>
<p>Data presented at the meeting suggest that one-half to three-quarters of those who get severe H1N1 are relatively healthy.</p>
<p>"Because the general recommendations are that people with mild disease don't have to be treated, the question then becomes, if you're relatively healthy, when do you seek medical care?" Kumar said. "If you shouldn't treat everybody, when do you start taking anti-virals?"</p>
<p>"I think the (WHO) statement will basically say -- and I think we all feel -- that if you're not improving by the third day, if you haven't plateaued or you're getting worse by day three or four, it's time to go in and see a doctor, and they should consider the possibility of anti-viral therapy."</p>
<p>Symptoms of H1N1 are the same for regular seasonal flu and include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue.</p>
<p>"But those are the obvious ones," Kumar said. "The one that we were most concerned people would overlook is shortness of breath."</p>
<p>In severe cases, people have deteriorated rapidly and gone into respiratory failure with 24 hours.</p>
<p>The first batches of the long-awaited H1N1 vaccine will be released across Canada this week in what will ultimately become the largest immunization campaign in the nation's history. The shots are being rolled out in stages and will concentrate first on those considered at highest risk, including health-care workers, pregnant women, people under 65 with chronic diseases, children ages six months to five years, and individuals, including First Nations people, living in remote or isolated communities.</p>

<p>While most provinces won't start rolling out the H1N1 flu vaccine until today, on Saturday, about 300 health workers in the Basques region of Quebec got the shot early, after roughly a dozen students at a local school tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>"We're doing this to protect our clientele, to make sure the health workers giving out the vaccine are immunized," Isabelle Tremblay, H1N1 vaccination co-ordinator for the local health region, said in French on Saturday.</p>
<p>The health region is located about 250 kilometres northeast of Quebec City.</p>

<p>Instead of shaking hands, graduating University of Ottawa students curtsied, winked, saluted, nodded and fist-bumped their way across the podium on Sunday.</p>
<p>University of Ottawa president Allan Rock said he was advised against shaking hands with the 1,400 graduates due to concerns over the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"I have a huge instinct to stick my hand out wherever I am and say: 'Hi, how are you?' " said the former Liberal cabinet minister.</p>

<p>"You can't be too careful these days," I explained while she clawed at the door to the house, trying to get back inside.</p>
<p>"Let me in," she shouted through the mail slot.</p>
<p>"No," I replied. "You were coughing. Might be swine flu."</p>
<p>"I had a cracker stuck in my throat," she protested.</p>
<p>A likely story. I know the infectious hack of H1N1 when I hear it. No way I was letting her drag me into her pestilential swamp.</p>
<p>But then, for once, I pulled down my surgical mask and paused: Could it be that I was overreacting?</p>
<p>Frequent readers might recall that I am one of the world's great Chicken Littles, every health scare, every potential crisis sending me scurrying for the bunker. Norwalk, ebola, killer bees, radon gas -- I panic like a Maple Leafs fan, every time.</p>
<p>The apocalyptic promise of Y2K was a major disappointment: I ended up with a six-year supply of Spam and a $40,000 Visa bill when the millennium meltdown fizzled in 2000. I freaked out and screamed "Anthrax!" every time I got doughnut dust on my shirt in 2001, which was also the year of the global foot and mouth disease outbreak, the one where I had to shoot my farmer friends, just in case. That meant there weren't too many of them to worry about during the mad cow cull of 2003 and the Great Chicken Genocide of 2005, when an avian flu outbreak emptied supermarket shelves.</p>
<p>Interspersed were the frightening discovery of Cryptococcus neoformans on Vancouver Island in 2002, which led me to hold my breath every time we drove past Parksville, and the arrival of SARS in 2003, after which I swore off Toronto forever. (OK, that's a fib: I swore off Toronto in 1978.)</p>
<p>SARS was the one that shook our confidence in pandemics. It was supposed to sweep the globe like Tamagotchis, or the Atkins diet, or the Spice Girls. Luckily, only 800 people died during the outbreak, including 44 in Canada. More Canadians are hit by lightning in an average year than were killed by SARS.</p>
<p>Which brings us to H1N1. It is already much more widespread in Canada than was SARS. As of Friday, about 4,800 people had succumbed to the disease worldwide, including 80 in Canada. But the thing is, the overall death rate from H1N1 isn't much greater than it is for the seasonal flu that leaves you singing to the porcelain now and then -- although H1N1 has a different profile, hitting younger people harder. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control says 4,000 to 8,000 Canadians die of seasonal flu and/or pneumonia every year.</p>
<p>But look at the difference in response: A coughing passenger was asked to leave a Victoria bus the other day. Ottawa churchgoers have been asked to stop holding hands during the Lord's Prayer. In Tokyo, visitors to a large corporate headquarters were directed to gargle with a medicinal substance before entering any room. In India, so many people took to wearing surgical masks in public that the price shot from 10 cents to $3 -- this at a time when H1N1 had killed a total of 21 people in a nation of 1.2 billion. Christopher Hitchens reports Cairo's garbage problem is out of control now that the pigs that used to devour the city's organic waste have been slaughtered in the belief that they were carriers of "swine flu." Likewise, Afghanistan's only pig was quarantined at the Kabul zoo out of fear that it could spread the disease to humans. (If you're the only pig, where do you get the flu from?)</p>
<p>I am, if necessary, fully prepared to panic. But as a layman, gosh, it's hard to figure out when.</p>
<p>Well, panic is never good, says Ray Wadia of the Centre for Disease Control. But neither is complacency. Better to plan for contingencies: Is there someone to care for you or your kids if you're ill? Talk to your doctor if in a high-risk group. Be prepared.</p>
<p>Mostly, just use common sense: Wash your hands. Stay home when sick. Sneeze into your elbow. Keep your fingers out of your nose, or the noses of others. And let your family back inside.</p>

</p>
<p>Liverpool beat Manchester United 2-0 to end its four-game losing streak and keep Chelsea at the top of the Premier League on Sunday, while Arsenal and Manchester City threw away two-goal leads and settled for ties.</p>
<p>Arsenal tied West Ham 2-2 but still moved above Tottenham into third, while Clint Dempsey's equalizer gave Fulham a 2-2 tie with Man City.</p>
<p>Goals by Fernando Torres and David Ngog earned Liverpool its third straight Premier League win over United.</p>
<p>"The players have answered a lot of questions and that's the most important thing," said Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez. "We have to keep going. We can't get too excited about today."</p>
<p>United's second defeat put them two points behind Chelsea, which outplayed Blackburn 5-0 on Saturday. Liverpool moved up three spots to fifth.</p>
<p>Dempsey headed home Jonathan Greening's free kick in the 68th minute to deny Man City the win at home and prevent the home side climbing to third.</p>
<p>City appeared in control after strikes by Joleon Lescott (53rd) and Martin Petrov (60th). But Damien Duff replied in the 62nd and Dempsey knotted the score.</p>
<p>"At 2-0 up, we should see the game off," Manchester City manager Mark Hughes said. "We acknowledged before the game that Dempsey was a good header of a ball and told the guys, but we allowed him to score."</p>
<p>First-half goals by Robin van Persie and William Gallas gave Arsenal a comfortable lead at next-to-last West Ham, but Carlton Cole and Alessandro Diamanti forced the tie. Arsenal still moved to third above Tottenham, which lost 1-0 at home to Stoke on Saturday. The Gunners also have a game in hand on Tottenham and Liverpool.</p>
<p>GERMANY</p>
<p>Ten-man Hamburger SV forced a 3-3 tie at Schalke to move into a tie with Bayer Leverkusen atop the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>Unbeaten in the league, Leverkusen drew 1-1 with Borussia Dortmund on Friday and has an edge on goal difference. Both teams have 22 points. In other games, Werder Bremen rallied for a 4-1 win in Bochum and last-place Hertha Berlin ended an eight-game skid by holding champion Wolfsburg to a 0-0 draw.</p>
<p>SCOTLAND</p>
<p>First-half goals by Shaun Maloney and Scott McDonald gave Celtic a 2-1 victory at Hamilton and helped the club move back on top of the Scottish Premier League. Defending champions Rangers were held 1-1 at home by Hibernian on Saturday.</p>
<p>NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>FC Twente beat FC Groningen 4-0 to stay atop the Dutch league and extend its unbeaten run to 11 games, while Ajax beat defending champion AZ Alkmaar 4-2 to move into second place.</p>
<p>SPAIN</p>
<p>Barcelona thrashed Zaragoza 6-1 to move three points clear of Real Madrid at the top of the Spanish league on Sunday, helped by a Seydou Keita hat trick and two goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Barcelona now has 22 points, three ahead of Real Madrid, which drew 0-0 with Sporting Gijon 0-0 on Saturday.</p>
<p>ITALY</p>
<p>Brazilian striker Amauri ended a barren four-match run for Juventus by scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win at struggling Siena in Serie A. Juve are third with 18 points from nine games, four behind Inter and two shy of second-place Sampdoria, after the leading duo beat Catania 2-1 and Bologna 4-1 respectively on Saturday.</p>

</p>
<p>The Edmonton Oilers dressing room looked a lot like a walk-in medical clinic Saturday morning in advance of the latest installment in the Battle of Alberta.</p>
<p>In one corner, hulking J.F.Jacques dripped profusely with sweat that didn't come from the physical exertion of a light morning skate.</p>
<p>In the other corner, defenceman Tom Gilbert discreetly sniffled through a string of media queries centred on the seasonal flu virus that has walloped the Oilers.</p>
<p>"A lot of guys have a lot symptoms," Gilbert said. "But guys are battling through it. We're trying to take as many precautions as possible. Separate rooms. Different water bottles. All the precautions to avoid other people catching it.</p>
<p>"Anything you can think of besides wearing a mask - which is probably the next step."</p>
<p>The casualty list keeps growing in Oil country. First came Ales Hemsky and Ladislav Smid, then came Gilbert Brule and Mike Comrie.</p>
<p>Neither Comrie or Brule made the trip down to Calgary for Saturday's clash.</p>
<p>"We're fielding who we have," Oilers head coach Pat Quinn said after the morning skate.</p>
<p>With the addition of minor-league call-up Theo Peckham, the Oilers had seven defenceman and 11 forwards.</p>
<p>"We're fighting the flu bug here, and guys are battling through it," said Oilers enforcer Zack Stortini. "We've got a lot of character guys on the team.</p>
<p>"It's been a few days now. We're doing the things necessary to stay healthy - little things like making sure you sanitize things like the workout equipment after you use it. Little stuff like that to help prevent it."</p>
<p>Thankfully, the illness responsible for decimating the Oilers is not believed to be the H1NI virus. Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and chief public health officer David Butler-Jones were both in Calgary Saturday to attend the hockey game and urge fans, via the Jumbotron, to get immunized for both the seasonal flu virus and H1N1.</p>
<p>The NHL protocol for dealing with the flu virus includes everything from the regular use of hand sanitizers to using separate water bottles and towels to sneezing into the arm instead of the hand.</p>
<p>Both the Flames and Oilers have already had their seasonal flu shots. No Flames, to this point, are sick.</p>
<p>The Oilers, on that score, envy their southern rivals.</p>
<p>"You've just got to hope for the best and try to protect yourself," forward Patrick O'Sullivan said. "It's something to worry about. But, at the end of the day, it's one of those things where you try to prevent it as much as you can. But you've got to live your life too.</p>
<p>"I mean, anybody could walk out the door, walk across the street and get hit by a car. So what are you going to do? Stay in your house all day? No. You're going to live your life and see what happens."</p>

</div><div>Sarah Mcginnis   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald; A Recent Canwest News Service; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>699 words</div><div>25 October 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>If a majority of Canadians refuse the H1N1 vaccine, hospitals will be overrun by serious flu patients and many businesses will be strapped for staff by Christmas, Canada's chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones warned on Saturday.</p>
<p>His warning comes as Alberta Health Services prepares to offer H1N1 influenza vaccines starting Monday.</p>
<p>poll showed 48 per cent of Canadians surveyed aren't keen to roll up their sleeves for the shot--a possibility that worries Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>If that happens, "we've got a big problem in ICUs (intensive-care units) being able to keep up. We would have a big problem in the health system being able to keep up over Christmas," Butler-Jones said Saturday during a visit to Calgary.</p>
<p>"Any doctor or any nurse should give up on any Christmas holidays."</p>
<p>Last week, Alberta reported its ninth H1N1-related death.</p>
<p>The patient was a Calgary man over the age of 50 with a pre-existing medical condition, said Alberta Health and Wellness spokesman Howard May.</p>
<p>The death, along with an upswing in absences from local schools and business offices, has confirmed that the second wave of H1N1 influenza has arrived in Alberta.</p>
<p>"We need people to stay calm, stay healthy and get vaccinated," said Alberta Health Services spokesman James Finstad.</p>
<p>He declined to speculate on what might happen in a few months should people avoid taking the H1N1 flu shot. But Finstad said there are measures in place to ensure there would be enough medical staff to treat an upswing of flu patients.</p>
<p>"We have been looking at all available options and have been working with our union partners to see how staff could be redeployed as part of our contingency," he said.</p>
<p>As health professionals continue refining pandemic plans, all employers are being urged to encourage staff to take the vaccine or risk mass absences during the height of the holiday season.</p>
<p>Without the flu shot, it could be common to have 30 per cent of employees out sick or at home caring for ill family members on any given day, Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>"You can shut down a whole organization if you don't have the vaccine, seriously," said Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, who was in Calgary on Saturday to promote the new vaccine.</p>
<p>Widespread illness could cripple small businesses, said Richard Truscott, Alberta director of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.</p>
<p>Many of his members have between 10 and 15 employees--or less. Having one or two people call in sick could force some businesses to close temporarily.</p>
<p>Having a possible flu pandemic strike near Christmas makes the already challenging financial picture even more grim.</p>
<p>"The Christmas season is huge. It means the difference between having a profitable year and losing money for many businesses, especially given the latest economic turmoil," said Truscott.</p>
<p>"I don't think the timing could be worse."</p>
<p>Despite all of the vaccination pleas, concern continues to swirl around the shots.</p>
<p>Calgary social work student Christine Molohon is struggling to decide whether to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>"It feels like it got pushed through so quickly. I'm not feeling secure it's safe," she said.</p>
<p>"I'll probably get it because I'm afraid not to."</p>
<p>Gut reactions or rumours should not replace scientific fact as the basis for choosing whether or not to get the vaccine, said Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>"People are looking to media for medical advice and it's not necessarily correct advice," she said.</p>
<p>"Dr. Butler-Jones has been very, very adamant--it's safe."</p>
<p>The risk of experiencing severe side-effects after taking the H1N1 shot is literally one in one million, compared to the 20 to 35 per cent of the population who will get sick from this pandemic flu without protection, said Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>"If every single Canadian is inoculated, then 30 Canadians could have the potential for a severe side-effect, compared to 10 million people sick, 100,000 people in hospital and 10,000 people dead," Butler-Jones said.</p>

</p>
<p>Public mistrust of the H1N1 flu vaccine is understandable, given the conflicting information from health officials in recent weeks. It's been nothing short of a debacle. The public deserves reliable information to make an informed choice, but contradictory H1N1 messages have resulted in considerable public apathy.</p>
<p>Typically, only about one in three people get seasonal flu vaccines, a pattern only slightly better for H1N1 vaccines despite assurances from health officials that the vaccine is safe and effective. The good news is that they all now seem to be singing from the same page. It remains to be seen if it is too late to alleviate public concerns. Currently slightly less than half of Canadians say they will be vaccinated against H1N1. If public participation is a flop and a full-blown pandemic results, the health industry should shoulder much of the blame.</p>
<p>A sensible voice last week was that of Dr. Margaret Russell, a physician and University of Calgary vaccine researcher. "The vaccine is your best bet for protection against H1N1," said Russell. "It's the single best thing people can do to protect themselves and the people they love."</p>

<p>Homeless shelters in Alberta will soon be able to offer H1N1 immunization on site, as there are concerns the province's homeless population is particularly vulnerable to the virus.</p>
<p>Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Yvonne Fritz said there are a number of good reasons to vaccinate homeless people at shelters.</p>
<p>"Their identification, transportation, their complex health needs--it's just important that they be vaccinated on site," Fritz said in an interview Saturday night, as she was attending a fundraising gala in support of the Mustard Seed Street Ministry.</p>
<p>"That is going to occur and it's going to occur fairly quickly," she said of the immunization plan for the province's homeless.</p>
<p>Myron Krause, the Mustard Seed's executive director, said Saturday that people staying at the shelter live in close proximity to each other and often have compromised health due to the challenges of being homeless.</p>
<p>He said the Mustard Seed will be offering immunization for H1N1 on Nov. 10.</p>
<p>"The idea is to make it accessible as possible for the people that we serve and, hopefully, as soon as possible," Krause said.</p>
<p>He said the Mustard Seed is in discussions in the hopes of bumping that date forward.</p>
<p>"We have a highly susceptible population group to flu," Krause said.</p>
<p>"We're hearing that there's symptoms hitting our city at this point, already," he said. "We just wouldn't want that to spread in the shelter system or in the inner-city community."</p>
<p>Krause said the Mustard Seed does have a pandemic plan, which shelter officials will review today with a representative of the province.</p>
<p>There are already sanitizers in all main entries to the Mustard Seed, and clients are told to report any symptoms.</p>
<p>"We have some limitations in our shelter," he said. "There's only so much space to quarantine people.</p>
<p>"But as much as we can, if people have symptoms, we put them in their own area and try and keep them removed from the rest of the population," said Krause.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Quebec begins H1N1 vaccinations after school outbreak</b>
</div><div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>384 words</div><div>25 October 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A08</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>MONTREAL -- Authorities in Quebec began vaccinations for the H1NI virus two days ahead of schedule Saturday after a school was hit by a second wave of the flu.</p>
<p>A health centre in Trois-Pistoles, 200 kilometres northeast of Quebec City, confirmed Friday that 13 students from Arc-en-Ciel high school had mild cases of the flu. Almost a third of the 393 students were absent last week with various health complaints.</p>
<p>Ottawa approved the H1N1 vaccine Wednesday and it will be available to some high-risk groups Monday, though schedules differ from region to region. Toronto clinics are to start vaccinations on Nov. 2</p>
<p>The Quebec move came as U.S. President Barack Obama declared the pandemic a national emergency in an effort to speed treatment to thousands of infected people.</p>
<p>White House officials said the effort is designed to make decisions easier when they need to be made.</p>
<p>The declaration authorizes Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to bypass federal rules when opening off-site hospital centres. Flu activity - virtually all of it the swine flu - is now widespread in 46 U.S. states, the level of a typical winter flu season. It is estimated the flu has killed more than 1,000 Americans and hospitalized more than 20,000.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Ontario Health Ministry said neither move will affect Ontario's course of action because the province is already acting with a sense of urgency. "We're able to take those steps without having to invoke emergency legislation," said Kevin Finnerty.</p>
<p>Ontario doctors, meanwhile, are asking employers to reconsider asking for a doctor's note from those absent from work due to flu.</p>
<p>"In order to help reduce the transmission of H1N1 and other illnesses, Ontario's doctors believe it is wise for patients to stay home when they have flu-like symptoms," said Dr. Suzanne Strasberg, president of the Ontario Medical Association.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Canadians who don't get vaccinated are needlessly putting themselves and others at risk. "We're starting to see more cases in Canada, we're seeing more deaths and we don't know how bad it's going to be," she told the Calgary Sun.</p>

<p>Shades of 1919.</p>
<p>Ninety years ago it was the Spanish Influenza that swept the globe. Today it is H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Back then, hockey fever was a psychological antidote. It remains so today.</p>
<p>The current pandemic, though alarming, has a long way to go to match the devastating effects of the viral rampage of 1918-19, which came on the heels of World War I and claimed more than 20 million lives worldwide, possibly many more.</p>
<p>Another victim of the scourge was that year's Stanley Cup final, between Seattle and Montreal. The series was tied but the decisive game was called off - it was never played - when the entire Canadiens team came down with the sickness. One of the players died of it four days later.</p>
<p>Author Eric Zweig has woven the history of the time into a fictional account of a 14-year-old lad, David Saifert, who grew up in Montreal and lost his parents to the war and the flu. The boy lands a job with the Canadiens and winds up in Seattle, hoping to find an uncle and a possible connection to a new life.</p>
<p>Zweig, who lives in Owen Sound, Ont., and has publishing ties to the NHL, has written an informative soft-covered read that moves along at a quick pace. Younger readers, especially early teens, might find it the perfect company while recovering from the flu bug.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Equip nursing students for H1N1 response</b>
</div><div>Jessica Ross   </div>

<div>244 words</div><div>25 October 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>As a fourth-year bachelor of science student studying registered nursing, I'm seriously concerned for my health and well-being.</p>
<p>In an Oct. 13 report, it was stated that "young, healthy women [are] hit hardest by H1N1 flu." My main concern as a student nurse surrounds the hospital protocols for the H1N1 virus and the use of N95 masks.</p>
<p>The college I attend has been struggling with the subject of having students fit-tested for N95 masks due to cost. If there is a outbreak of H1N1, the college has responsibilities to keep student nurses safe and protected. If we are not fit-tested, we will not be allowed to help those in need.</p>
<p>According to the Vancouver Island Health Authority, staff who have not yet been fit-tested and are providing direct care to patients with known or suspected H1N1 will be fit-tested as a priority.</p>
<p>In my opinion, due to budget shortfalls and the estimated costs for N95 masks, which is stated to be five to 10 times greater than surgical masks, student nurses are not considered a priority.</p>
<p>Perhaps student nurses should be considered more as a vital part of the health-care system during times of need. In pandemic matters such as the H1N1 virus, should budget cuts be determining the well-being and safety of student nurses, the future of registered nursing?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>50-cent phone calls introduced without a peep</b>
</div><div>Jack Knox   </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>792 words</div><div>25 October 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>Tried to get upset about the 50-cent pay-phone call. Couldn't do it.</p>
<p>Getting worked up about a 50-cent pay phone is like getting worked up about $40-a-pound brussels sprouts. It only matters if you actually eat brussels sprouts, which nobody does. (I once wrote that brussels sprouts are only good for hucking at dogs, but that ticked off some literal-minded dog owners, so I'll say this instead: Brussels sprouts are only good for hucking at nuns.)</p>
<p>Ditto for pay phones. (No, not the nun-hucking part.) The only people who care what pay phones cost are those who still use them frequently, a rapidly shrinking user pool.</p>
<p>Just as the automobile killed the railroads and the computer made handwriting a lost art, the mobile phone has meant the demise of the coin-operated variety. With cellphone ownership well over 70 per cent and rising, pay phones are disappearing faster than Balloon Boy's chances of a reality-TV show. Telus has only 20,000 pay phones left in B.C. and Alberta, down from 30,000 just three years ago.</p>
<p>Still, a need exists. Among those who rely on pay phones are the young, the poor, tourists and drug dealers, though I'm not sure how that last bit works. I tried to use a coin-operated phone to score some crack downtown, but ended up on a bus tour to the Bellingham factory outlet stores by mistake. Telus's Shawn Hall says the company tries to keep pay phones in transportation hubs -- airports, bus depots -- and low-income areas.</p>
<p>Ain't easy, though. Something about pay phones triggers the same impulse that makes people want to punch mascots and street mimes. In 2005, it was reported that 20 per cent of Vancouver Island's 1,700 pay phones had been vandalized. More often than not, they're not worth fixing.</p>
<p>"At $5,000 each to replace, that's a lot of quarters," Hall said.</p>
<p>There's a provincial park in the Interior where someone ripped out a phone half a dozen times before Telus gave up. "It cost $30,000 for a handful of quarters every month."</p>
<p>Sometimes the company yanks phones because they're magnets for those up to no good (dealers, prostitutes, politicians) but then that leaves other customers stranded. The compromise is curfews: To curb illicit activity, some downtown Victoria phones can't be used between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. for anything except dialling 9-1-1 (which is free, by the way).</p>
<p>Which brings us to the doubling of pay-phone charges, a development so shocking that, um, few noticed when it happened in early September. The last time the rate rose -- from a dime to a quarter in 1984 -- consumers were apoplectic. This time, not a peep.</p>
<p>Which prompted me to take a quick pay-phone tour. First stop: The Times Colonist lobby, only to discover that the phone had disappeared a few months ago. We think Telus took it, but it might have been Jeff Bell. Telus is under no regulatory obligation to maintain pay phones. The rules only say the company must consult with a community before it removes the last one.</p>
<p>Then I checked out the full Superman-length booth outside the bus depot. Nobody there.</p>
<p>Staked out a street phone in James Bay for 10 minutes, only to find it had been gutted like the slowest wildebeest on the Serengeti.</p>
<p>But two banks of Bell phones (B.C. has seven pay-phone companies) in the Bay Centre were in frequent use and -- bonus! -- still cost a quarter. I called Paul Willcocks and told him I was using a pay phone.</p>
<p>"Really?" he responded, sounding as though I had told him I was driving a steam locomotive or buying smokes from a vending machine.</p>
<p>"Hang up and I'll try calling you."</p>
<p>Didn't work. The pay phone didn't ring. That's OK. I didn't want to use the handset again anyway. One look at the previous user had prompted me to hold the mouthpiece as far away as possible, though I still had to hold the earpiece to my head. (Can you get H1N1 through the ears?)</p>
<p>It was, in fact, tough finding phones. The numbers and locations of close to 500 of them are listed by the user-driven Victoria Public Phone Mapping Project, but that effort is soon to be discontinued -- the list is growing out of date as phones vanish and most people stop caring, leaving those who love brussels sprouts with less to eat, at any cost.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mexico hopes for better times ahead</b>
</div><div>Phil Reimer   </div>

</p>
<p>Travelling in the shoulder season, which is just before or after the high season, has its advantages. Prices are lower, the crowds are smaller and most people involved in the tourist market are happy to see you.</p>
<p>That was the case last week when I cruised the Mexican Riviera aboard Royal Caribbean's Mariner of the Seas.</p>
<p>It's been a tough year for Mexican Tourism. The recession and the H1N1 flu have hurt them badly. Although it's been difficult, Mexicans are optimistic about this winter.</p>
<p>The typical Riviera ports for cruise ships are Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta and Cabo San Lucas. Our schedule was turned upside down due to tropical storm Patricia, but we managed to visit all three ports.</p>
<p>Mazatlan, according to our guide Umberto, is the music capital of Mexico and, once you hit the Zona Dorada, or Golden Zone, you'll encounter club after club and wall-to-wall stores. Along the waterfront, as you travel from Old Town to the Golden Zone, are statues that honour everything from Mazatlan's pulmonia taxis, which look like golf carts, to one of their biggest employers, Pacifico Brewery.</p>
<p>As in most of Mexico's coastal cities, walking is the best way to see the old parts of town. The Church of the Immaculate Conception was worth a visit in old Mazatlan.</p>
<p>I didn't go, but I heard favourable comments about the beach on Stone Island, the Papantla Flyers show and the day trips to the Sierra Madre Mountains and the towns of Concordia and Copala.</p>
<p>When we got to Puerto Vallarta, we had an authentic Mexican food experience. It started with breakfast at La Canoa at Marina Vallarta. It is a simple family restaurant with true eggs ranchero, orange juice, bottled water and coffee for less than $6.</p>
<p>It ended with lunch, typically eaten at 2 p.m., at 8 Tostada, which was only about a five-minute drive from the port. I started with a marlin tostada followed by a Mexican version of bouillabaisse that was loaded with fresh fish.</p>
<p>Between meals, we drove downtown and then to the old section of Puerto Vallarta.</p>
<p>I spent the morning at the Dolphin Adventure Center where you can swim with dolphins. They are truly amazing when you are up close to them. For more details go to vallarta-adventures.com.</p>
<p>The best beach in town is in the Romantic Zone. There is also a pier where you can watch local people fish with nothing more than a line and a hook, no rod or reel needed.</p>
<p>Our final port of call was Cabo San Lucas where Mariner anchored offshore and we tendered in.</p>
<p>While many passengers participated in a myriad of water sports, Mauro Butron from Terramar, a well-known tour organization started by former Vancouverite Kim Clapham, had a different idea.</p>
<p>We immediately took off with him for San Jose Del Cabo that is some 50 kilometres down the main road on the way to Fortuna. San Jose represents the true Mexico.</p>
<p>I avoided the tourist stores as Butron took me to authentic Mexican craft stores such as Negri for ceramics, Veryka for Mexican artisans and Antigua Los Cabos for more authentic goods. All are located in the Mission Plaza.</p>
<p>After sitting and talking in the courtyard at La Panga Antigua restaurant, we enjoyed more Mexican food, this time a meal of delicious chicken mole. We then travelled down a dusty, rutted road to a most amazing botanical garden that featured cacti. Of the world's 1,500 known cacti species, 800 are grown at the garden which is called Wirikuta.</p>
<p>I blogged every day on this trip so if you are interested to read more about the cacti garden, each port and the ship, then go to my blog at portsandbows.com.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Cascades chief talks tough on subsidies; We don't need help to humble our U.S. competitors, Alain Lemaire declares</b>
</div><div>Lynn Moore   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service; Montreal Gazette</div>
<div>531 words</div><div>25 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A38</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>Even though the rising loonie has a multimillion-dollar effect on the bottom line of <span class="companylink">Cascades Inc</span>., the Quebec-based paper products producer says it doesn't need a currency subsidy to humble its U.S. competitors.</p>
<p>"Cascades is ready to compete with the dollar at par," CEO Alain Lemaire said after the recent opening of a $15-million expansion of its tissue paper plant in Lachute, about 75 kilometres northwest of Montreal.</p>
<p>Every one-cent increase in the Canadian dollar takes a bite of between $4 million to $5 million from annual corporate profits "so we are not happy about that," said Lemaire, about the company that has become one of the largest paper recyclers and green paper producers in North America.</p>
<p>"But if we are efficient, if we have good infrastructure, if we have good equipment, we [should] be as good as them. Why do we need [currency] subsidies to be as good as our neighbour?"</p>
<p>Lemaire was perhaps buoyed by the formal christening of Cascades' new plant, which will increase its converting capacity by about 50 per cent, pumping out almost 3.4 million cases of paper hand towels and tissue papers for commercial and industrial clients.</p>
<p>Cascades has impressed some analysts -- and investors -- with its second-quarter profit of $30 million, which was reported in mid-August as many other paper producers were struggling to maintain stability amid the economic downturn and slumping demand.</p>
<p>The Lachute expansion is poised to become the first new paper plant in North America to obtain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification.</p>
<p>The 6,800-square-metre expansion replaces five production lines with a single line using cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Investissement Quebec</span> provided a loan of $3.1 million, while Emploi-Quebec offered $379,000 to train employees on the new equipment.</p>
<p>The government and corporate investments in the paper plant secure about 160 jobs, Lemaire said.</p>
<p>One of the most striking features of the expansion is the prominent placement of three large stained glass windows, restored from originals which were among materials salvaged from the former St. Julien church in Lachute.</p>
<p>The church, consecrated in 1936, had fallen into disrepair -- its stone crumbling and with windows broken -- and needed to be demolished, said Suzanne Blanchet, CEO of Cascades' Tissue Group, a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Cascades Inc</span>.</p>
<p>In exchange for the land, Cascades took down the church and used much of its stone and some artifacts, including a huge bell, in the plant expansion.</p>
<p>While the recession has seen the commercial demand for paper napkins drop, paper towels sales have increased, said Blanchet, who linked the increased demand to more hand-washing in a bid to avoid germs and the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Kingsey Falls, Que., about 170 kilometres northeast of Montreal, Cascades employs about 13,000 people in North America and Europe.</p>

<p>With federal officials declaring Friday that Canada is in its "second wave" of the H1N1 pandemic, a new poll reveals that almost half of Canadians do not plan to get the vaccine created to stop it.</p>
<p>Thirty per cent of those surveyed said they are not at all likely to get the shot, while 18 per cent said they are not very likely, according to a phone poll by Ipsos Reid.</p>
<p>Of those polled, 51 per cent are leaning toward it, with 36 per cent saying they are very likely to get the shot.</p>
<p>The results reflect the challenge public health officials have ahead of them in trying to encourage immunization.</p>
<p>"The choice is simple: A safe and effective preventive vaccine or a very real risk of disease," said Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones.</p>

</p>
<p>Health Canada approved this country's H1N1 vaccine without evaluating its safety and effectiveness on a single Canadian.</p>
<p>Instead, the federal drug regulator approved the shot based on the results of a small clinical trial in Belgium.</p>
<p>The study involved 130 healthy adults, aged 18 to 60, who were inoculated with the same version of Canada's vaccine, which is produced by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> under the trade name Arepanrix.</p>
<p>The vaccine used in the Belgian study was manufactured by GSK in Germany. Canada's vaccine is produced in Sainte-Foy, Que.</p>
<p>Health Canada officials released the information late Friday, in response to questions submitted by the Ottawa Citizen about what scientific evidence was used to establish the safety and effectiveness of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>"Data from a clinical trial conducted in Belgium, using the same version of the vaccine produced by GSK in Dresden, Germany, was reviewed, as was initial safety data from European and Japanese studies using . . . Arepanrix," Health Canada spokeswoman Christelle Legault said in an email.</p>
<p>Legault did not indicate how many volunteers participated in the Japanese or European studies that used the Quebec-made vaccine.</p>
<p>To date, Health Canada has not reviewed any data from the clinical trials being conducted in this country, said Legault.</p>
<p>"Canadian clinical trials, which began in October, will be used as part of ongoing work to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in larger and more specific populations, after the vaccine authorization takes place," said Legault.</p>
<p>Since Wednesday, when Health Canada surprised many observers by approving the pandemic vaccine two weeks ahead of schedule, questions have been raised about precisely what information went into evaluating the shot.</p>
<p>Opposition parties have called on federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq to make public the medical evidence used to determine the safety of the H1N1 vaccine, in order to reassure Canadians that no short cuts were taken in the race to test and produce it.</p>
<p>"'Trust me' is not the way to build confidence with Canadians," said Liberal health critic Carolyn Bennett, a family physician. "Let's be transparent about it."</p>
<p>At a news conference Friday, Aglukkaq said Health Canada approved the vaccine ahead of the initial target of early November because "the international community was able to share their clinical data and work with us."</p>
<p>As a result, "we had all the data that was necessary to make an informed decision on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine by Wednesday," said Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>The questions are being raised because Canadian scientists, who started testing the Glaxo vaccine last week, have indicated that it could take up to seven weeks to collect the early results from Canadian test subjects.</p>
<p>The situation stands in marked contrast to the U.S., where federally funded scientists last month published early results of their safety and effectiveness studies, weeks ahead of the vaccine's approval.</p>
<p>The ongoing studies by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases are being done in 2,800 people -- a substantially larger sample than the 130 volunteers in the Belgian study reviewed by Health Canada.</p>

</p>
<p>Political suicide bomber Benoit Labonté has blown up his own career, just 10 days before Montreal's civic election. It remains to be seen how much collateral damage he has done to either of the major city parties, and their leaders.</p>
<p>In a bombshell interview with Radio-Canada this week, Labonté claimed to know of widespread, deep-rooted, systematic corruption in party financing and public-works contracting in Montreal, and claimed that city hall harbours a pervasive culture of don't-ask-don't-tell about this.</p>
<p>In a surreal twist, he claimed to be doing this to clear his name. Let's see now: He was a member of the executive committee under Mayor Gérald Tremblay, then leader of the opposition, then sidekick to Vision Montréal mayoral candidate Louise Harel, and all this time he knew city hall was reeking with sleaze, and he never went to the police? How is this revelation supposed to make him look better? If his claims are true, he has shown himself to be a swamp creature, no less than anyone else in the know.</p>
<p>Still, Labonté's claims have certainly rocked the election campaign. For icing on the cake, an Action démocratique member of the National Assembly claimed Thursday that three of Premier Jean Charest's ministers have enjoyed the yacht-cruise hospitality of construction mogul Tony Accurso. For the record, Charest repeats his ministers' denials, and Tremblay calls Labonté's claims false. And Labonté offers no evidence.</p>
<p>Labonté is no virtuous whistle-blower; he seems to us more like a crank shouting "Fire!" in a crowded theatre. But we'll give him this much: His timing was exquisite. Months of reports about undeniably shady dealings in the Tremblay administration have grown, this month, into a firestorm of speculation: The Quebec government sets up a dedicated team to look into construction-industry corruption (in the private sector as well as the public); media reports suggest public-works contract collusion in various Quebec cities; the Mafia is invoked; claims and counter-claims and denials fly like autumn leaves.</p>
<p>Now there is truly no recourse except a prompt announcement, by Charest, of a robust and sweeping public inquiry, armed with subpoena powers, a large and capable staff, and everything else needed to get to the bottom of all these claims - and of the endless cost over-runs that make them plausible.</p>
<p>Ideally such an inquiry should cover municipal contracts in the whole metropolitan area, because corruption, like swine flu, is no respecter of borders.</p>
<p>We can't understand why Charest has waited this long. True, big inquiries are costly, slow, elaborate, and rarely fully satisfactory. But in this case anything less will now seem, to many Quebecers, to be merely a cover-up.</p>
<p>The more immediate problem is that nothing we have heard this week gives Montrealers any guidance about how to vote on Nov. 1. If Labonté's claims are true, Tremblay doesn't look very good. But Harel was minister of municipal affairs and minister for greater Montreal from 1998 to 2003; if Labonté is correct, Harel either knew all about corrupt contracting and did nothing, or was so out of touch that she didn't know.</p>
<p>We can hear the Projet Montréal people clamouring: What about us? Why not a new broom to sweep clean? This week's rumour-fest might indeed help Richard Bergeron's party, but that doesn't mean he would be a better mayor than Tremblay or Harel. Bergeron and his candidates might be as clean as the driven snow, but zeal and good intentions do not get the streets plowed. Bergeron and his key people have little management experience at any level, and running a city with a $4-billion budget is practical, not theoretical.</p>
<p>Bergeron's bizarre beliefs and his inexperience impose too high a price in exchange for his freedom from the slime of innuendo which coats the other candidates right now. Being mayor of Montreal is a job for an adult.</p>
<p>Next week in this space: an endorsement, and some thoughts about choosing a good city council.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Second wave is at our shores; New cases. Mass immunization will give virus 'nowhere to go'</b>
</div><div>CHARLIE FIDELMAN    </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>1114 words</div><div>24 October 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>The provincial health department launched Quebec's biggest mass vaccination campaign against swine flu amid warnings yesterday that the H1N1 second wave has put several people in hospital; three are critically ill.</p>
<p>"There are 40 cases today on Montreal Island - and only 30 until yesterday," said David Levine, head of the Montreal Health and Social Services Agency.</p>
<p>To achieve "critical mass to control the virus," Levine said the goal is to vaccinate 1.4 million people, or 75 per cent of Montreal's population, within two months.</p>
<p>"The aim is quite high but the challenge is to create a mass immunity so the virus has nowhere to go," explained Richard Lessard, head of Montreal Public Health.</p>
<p>Only 160,000 doses will be available for Montreal as of next week so the vaccine schedule is set to priorities established by federal and provincial health experts.</p>
<p>Inoculations starting Monday will target the most vulnerable of society - the gravely ill, transplant patients, those living with diabetes, cancer and dialysis and others with severe chronic illnesses.</p>
<p>Hospitals and health centres employees plus homecare providers - doctors, nurses, dentists, pharmacists and health clinic personnel including secretaries - who are considered at risk of transmitting the virus will also get the vaccine.</p>
<p>First responders - ambulance, paramedics, police, firemen and bus drivers will also be first in line to roll up their sleeves.</p>
<p>But health care personnel will not be forced to participate in this free, voluntary program, Lessard said.</p>
<p>This initial wave of flu shots for frontline workers is to be handled within hospitals, long-term care centres and other work places, under the direction of local Social Service Centres (CSSS) of the health department.</p>
<p>The sequence will continue as of Nov. 6 at 17 vaccine sites - shopping malls, schools, the Olympic Stadium - with shots for parents of babies 6 months and younger, as well as the immediate families of people with immune deficiencies.</p>
<p>Pregnant women, children under 5 years of age and their parents will be the priority three days later. Then, people 18 years of age and under with a chronic illness; the following week, those 18 to 65 with a chronic illness, and as of Dec. 7, adults and children older than 5 and in good health.</p>
<p>But anyone showing up at a vaccination centre ahead of schedule will not be turned away, said Levine said.</p>
<p>Open seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., each centre's capacity will be about 320 people vaccinated per hour, for a total of 400,000 a week, Levine said.</p>
<p>"It's a new virus, it's an unknown virus, we don't know how it will mutate, and this is the only precautionary measure we have and I think the population will realize it and will accept to be vaccinated," he added.</p>
<p>Several medical associations have already put out notices asking their members to get the shot in solidarity.</p>
<p>Agency officials underlined the urgency of getting vaccinated for the good of others in the wake of a recent poll showing Montrealers are not keen on swine flu shots.</p>
<p>Montreal's first H1N1 wave from May to July sickened 1,287 people, including 230 hospitalized cases and 12 deaths.</p>
<p>But Lessard warned that 45 per cent of the people now hospitalized with swine flu complications in the United States had no underlying risk factors. "They were young people in good health. We cannot predict who will be sick," he said.</p>
<p>While it's true that the virus so far has been benign, Lessard said, "there are other features of this virus that makes us uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"For example, it's not normal for young pregnant women to die of the flu at 38 weeks of gestation. It's a new situation and if we cannot predict who will get the disease or the complications, it's better to protect everyone."</p>
<p>Montrealers will get notices via the mail starting in November about the vaccination program; it is also available online:</p>

<div id="hd"><b>All-out effort to immunize aboriginals; H1N1 vaccinations on First Nations reserves 'a priority'</b>
</div><div>Jamie Komarnicki; With files from Michelle Lang   </div>
<div>For the Calgary Herald</div>
<div>682 words</div><div>24 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Flyers, posters and "word-of-mouth" methods are being used by the province's 44 First Nations communities this weekend to spread information about individual H1N1 immunization clinics that will dole out the new vaccine on even the most remote reserves.</p>
<p>Health workers on each Alberta reserve will connect via video conferencing Monday morning for a final briefing before the clinics open to band members.</p>
<p>Provincial and federal health officials have been working closely with the bands to "ensure that all the First Nations communities in Alberta, whether they're remote or isolated, receive the vaccine on a priority basis," said Dr. Wadieh Yacoub, Health Canada medical officer of health for Alberta First Nations.</p>
<p>Band leaders have been scrambling to get the message out across reserves about the upcoming clinics since the province announced on Wednesday the imminent arrival of the vaccine in Alberta. Patricia Yellow Horn-Melton, community health co-ordinator for the Piikani reserve, began unpacking vaccine doses on Thursday.</p>
<p>She said the band will give the vaccine to front-line health workers first on Monday. Soon after, all band members will be able to access the immunization.</p>
<p>Band officials delivered flyers to all the homes on the reserve and sent notices home with students, Yellow Horn-Melton said. They've also plastered the community with posters to try to get the word out to all corners of the reserve.</p>
<p>"It's such a short notice but this has been in the news for quite a while," she said. "In our communities everything is by word of mouth . . . so the news spreads."</p>
<p>The clinic will be held at the local elementary school gymnasium--the same place where the band put on their seasonal flu vaccination.</p>
<p>Siksika health officials on the reserve about 100 kilometres east of Calgary also plan to follow similar guidelines with the H1N1 vaccination as their seasonal flu immunization.</p>
<p>The band is expecting an overwhelming response come Monday, said Tyler White, health director for Siksika. Still, some band members aren't sure whether to line up for the vaccine.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of interest and a lot of concern," White said. "We're doing our best to minimize that concern and hopefully answer any questions that do come out."</p>
<p>Aboriginal communities bore the brunt of the spring H1N1 outbreak. On Friday, Federal Indian Affairs Minister Chuck Strahl said the nation's aboriginals are in line for the "first wave" of available vaccine.</p>
<p>Exhaustive plans are in place to inform individual band members on individual reserves on how to access the immunization clinics, said Strahl, in Calgary to give a speech.</p>
<p>"Each community has put together their own plan on how to get that message out. The leadership in those communities, they're all behind it, and they'll be selling it in the community," Strahl said. "My hope is people will listen to their local leaders and take advantage of it."</p>
<p>Natives also have another reason to line up for the flu shot: the aboriginal community as a whole is a young population, said Yacoub. H1N1 can quickly strike previously healthy teens and young adults</p>
<p>"We're encouraging them to get it as soon as possible," Yacoub said.</p>
<p>Alberta's reserves have seen less than 10 serious H1N1 cases that required hospitalization, he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Calgary's H1N1 immunization clinics are also set to begin on Monday. The arrival of the vaccine has sparked a heated debate among those uncertain whether to get the shots to protect against the virus.</p>
<p>Dr. Hakique Virani, deputy medical officer of health for the First Nations Inuit Health branch, Health Canada, said First Nation's communities appear receptive to the vaccine. There is "really an anxiousness to get started," he said earlier this week.</p>

</p>
<p>Someone refused to shake my hand this week.</p>
<p>They weren't being rude. In fact, they thought they were doing me a favour.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2009 season of colds, flu, H1N1 and pandemic, more and more folks are realizing that something as simple as a handshake can make a difference.</p>
<p>In most workplaces now you will find hand-washing stations posted everywhere. Once found only in hospitals, these are a sign of our culture changing almost overnight. People are washing their hands several times a day and health experts say it is making a real difference.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu story dominated news coverage this week. Starting Monday, clinics across the city -- staffed with more than 100 redeployed city staff and as many as 75 temporary nurses -- will begin a massive immunization program that will see high-risk groups such as health-care workers, young children and pregnant women getting the first shots.</p>
<p>National Newspaper Award-winning reporter Naomi Powell takes a hard look at the H1N1 flu in today's paper.</p>
<p>Powell, who normally covers the steel beat and business, has also worked on other major health-care stories for the Spec, including our award-winning series on C. diff., the dangerous bug that killed hundreds in Ontario.</p>
<p>So what does it all mean? And how worried should we be? Powell's primer on the flu does a good job answering some basic questions about who is the most vulnerable, how vaccines work and how the flu is travelling around the world.</p>
<p>You will want to read it.</p>
<p>If it seems too good to be true, it usually is.</p>
<p>I was reminded of that old saying this week after reading coverage of Falcon Heene -- or, as he is now known in newsrooms across the continent, "the balloon boy."</p>
<p>Most of the journalists here were as enthralled as people across North America when the story broke. Right from the start, however, this particular tale produced more questions than answers.</p>
<p>How could a kid launch a helium balloon?</p>
<p>How could they get to the balloon to save him?</p>
<p>Where were his parents?</p>
<p>And when the balloon finally did hit the ground with no one aboard, where did the boy go?</p>
<p>As the constant TV, radio and newspaper coverage has made apparent, we have learned it was all a fake and his parents are facing charges.</p>
<p>"They put on a good show for us and we bought it," says Sheriff Jim Alderden of Larimer County.</p>
<p>So did we.</p>
<p>Sticking with television, Kevin Newman, anchor of the Global News Report, was in Hamilton this week.</p>
<p>He brought the show to town Monday and did several items about "a region and a people who had to reinvent themselves."</p>
<p>Newman, a graduate of the University of Western Ontario and a former early-morning TV star in the United States, said at one point "Hamilton had a 10-year head start on reinventing itself" and said the city has climbed back from adversity and is coping with the recession better than many others in Ontario.</p>
<p>It's sometimes interesting to hear a view from the outside.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hospitals get ready for H1N1 onslaught; Extra ventilators, expanded intensive care units part of strategy to cope with pandemic</b>
</div><div>Joanna Frketich  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>542 words</div><div>24 October 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A07</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>Hamilton hospitals are prepared to pull ventilators out of storage and from operating rooms to combat pandemic flu.</p>
<p>They have enough equipment, space and staff to expand intensive care units by 15 per cent.</p>
<p>If that's not enough, the province has a stockpile of ventilators Hamilton could try to access.</p>
<p>"We've been using that to try to plan ahead for what we anticipate will be a second and much bigger wave," said Dr. Peter Kraus, chief of critical care at Hamilton Health Sciences. "We're in a lot better position to respond. The problem will be the size of the response required. That's the million-dollar question. How big is it going to be?"</p>
<p>Kraus said Hamilton got off lightly during the first wave of H1N1 from April to July. During that time, there were six people requiring intensive care at Hamilton General, Henderson General, McMaster University Medical Centre and St. Joseph's Hospital.</p>
<p>All six were women -- none of them pregnant -- and had other significant diseases. Four of them died. H1N1 contributed to or caused three of those four deaths. The other death was caused by the disease the woman had before getting H1N1.</p>
<p>"They were really sick and they were a real challenge to oxygenate to keep them from lung failure," Kraus said. "They were on ventilators."</p>
<p>The urgent need to have extra ventilators available to hospitals was made clear by a Hamilton study published online this month by the Journal of the American Medical Association. Scheduled to be in print next month, it was deemed to be of such public importance by the medical journal that it released the observational study early.</p>
<p>The researchers from McMaster and St. Joseph's Healthcare found H1N1 caused critical illness rapidly after hospital admission, especially in women. They accounted for nearly 70 per cent of the 168 patients in 38 intensive care units across the country between April and June. Of those, 7 per cent were pregnant, which is normally rare in critical care.</p>
<p>Many of the patients required mechanical ventilators due to oxygenation failure for weeks in intensive care units.</p>
<p>"This study has underscored the importance of being prepared for the upcoming pandemic," said Dr. Deborah Cook, a co-author of the study. "We are well prepared in Hamilton."</p>
<p>Smaller neighbouring communities are concerned they don't have the same ability to provide extra intensive care. Hospitals across the local health integration network are working out a plan to share beds, equipment and staff if an intensive care unit becomes overwhelmed.</p>
<p>There is a provincial and LHIN inventory of ventilators and hospitals are looking at what they could quickly cut back on, such as elective surgery, if H1N1 started filling the intensive care units.</p>
<p>So far, the beginning of the second wave has been light, with four H1N1 patients currently in intensive care in Hamilton.</p>
<p>"No one knows how much impact the vaccination program starting next week will have," said Kraus, who added he plans to get the shot.</p>
<p>"It may help us avert a crisis."</p>

</p>
<p>H1N1 flu activity in Hamilton has already surpassed previous peak levels of seasonal flu and may still be on the rise, health officials say.</p>
<p>The number of positive H1N1 tests spiked to 21 per cent last week, up from 6 per cent the prior week, said Dr. Chris Mackie, Hamilton's associate medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"We're seeing more cases now than we did at any time in the last two years," Mackie said. "(H1N1) spreads a lot more easily and that's in part because we don't have a baseline level of immunity in the community."</p>
<p>Flu activity in Hamilton is "normally at zero" at this time of year, he said. A typical flu season runs from Christmas to March, with the number of positive tests usually at about 20 per cent.</p>
<p>But the novel H1N1 virus has broken with patterns, causing an initial wave of infections in the spring that tapered off through the summer.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, confirmed yesterday that a second wave of H1N1 has arrived in the province.</p>
<p>"Influenza activity in the province is continuing to increase," she said. "We are seeing that more people are visiting their health-care providers with influenza-like illness and more people are being hospitalized with complications from the flu in Ontario."</p>
<p>Halton has experienced a similar spike in positive H1N1 tests, said Dr. Bob Nosal, the region's medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Health officials can't test everyone with flu-like symptoms, but they use a sampling of lab tests from patients in hospitals, long-term care homes and doctors to evaluate the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Hamilton and Halton will make the first batch of the H1N1 vaccine available to people in high-risk groups next week. The clinics will be opened to the general public as more vaccine comes in.</p>
<p>"It would have been nice to have the vaccine a couple of weeks ago before the increase in activity ... ," Nosal said. "We should still be able to make an impact on transmission."</p>

</p>
<p>We do need geniuses.</p>
<p>Let's not forget that without geniuses we would never have electricity, combustion engines or gravity.</p>
<p>But sometimes it seems like our brightest minds are trying to change the world and they're looking in all the wrong places.</p>
<p>It might seem like "Real-Time Remeshing With Optimally Adapting Domain: A New Scheme for View-Dependent Continuous Levels-of-Detail Mesh Rendering" - the actual title of 19-year-old Yuanchen Zhu, of Shanghai, China's Intel Young Scientist Scholarship winning project - is important.</p>
<p>But it's not. Or it is. I'm not sure because I have no idea what it means. If I met Zhu at a party and he started telling me about his project, I would suddenly become very interested in the dip.</p>
<p>I would like to lobby for some common sense - something sorely lacking today, even in the genius community.</p>
<p>Here are some real problems and issues our brightest minds should be dedicated to fixing:</p>
<p>The Horseshoe-shaped toilet seat.</p>
<p>In your home, you probably have a toilet. And your toilet probably has a seat and that seat probably goes all the way around the bowl, doughnut style. But when you use some of your favourite away-from-home toilets - such as at work, at the mall or at the bus station - you are most likely to encounter a U-shaped bowl cover with an open end. I don't know what that open end is for. Unless it's open ended so that guys don't have to actually lift the lid to go. I'm going to try that.</p>
<p>Nope. That's not it either.</p>
<p>Ultra bright headlights.</p>
<p>Headlights have been a part of driving since the invention of the dark highway and little has been done to change how they perform. Until now. Now drivers are being sold new headlights designed to shine brighter over longer and wider distances, giving people who use them the ability to safely blind other motorists from long range.</p>
<p>Fundraising non-events.</p>
<p>It's hard to go to the mall (by which I mean liquor store) these days without being ambushed by someone selling raffle tickets, apples, cookies or something else to raise money for worthy causes. Some are easy to ignore (Really? The men's beer league hockey team needs to raise funds for a tournament?) but most are indeed worthy causes.</p>
<p>But I was recently accosted at a <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> by a couple of kids in hockey sweaters holding plastic cans. They didn't say anything. They just looked at me. I could read their minds. "Give us money." And this was at the drive-through! They weren't fundraisers so much as squeegee kids in training and they were perfecting the art of the shakedown.</p>
<p>In exchange for my donation I got… nothing. Well that's not true. I got my windshield wiper not broken.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just me, but I think if parents are going to send their kids out panhandling for change they should at least make them introduce themselves and tell people what they want their money for… and say thank you.</p>
<p>Baseball locker room celebrations.</p>
<p>What is wrong with baseball? Where should I start? It's boring. Games are on too late. A-Rod. The playoffs don't end until the snow flies. Canada's team sucks. . . I could go on. But possibly the lamest thing about baseball is the locker room celebration. In any other sport, teams bust open the champagne and make it rain after winning. A championship. Not a regular season title. Not a playoff series. A championship. But not in baseball. In baseball, every small victory is cause for celebration. Win your division? Crack the champagne. Win a wildcard spot? Crack the champagne. Win a divisional series? Crack it. Win the league championship and a trip to the World Series? Goggle up and have a drink. Win the World Series. Yep. You guessed it. Champagne.</p>
<p>It's like buying a cake every time someone in the office has a birthday. It's fun a couple times, but eventually, if you have cake two or three times a week, you get sick of it.</p>
<p>"Contact us" forms on websites.</p>
<p>When did companies stop giving us their email addresses? When I'm interested in a company and want to touch base, I used to go to their website and hit the "contact us" button. I'd be given a list of employees and I could pick the person who looked most likely to help me and send that person a personal email. But apparently now that's a little too personal and companies large and small no longer want you to be able to send their people a note.</p>
<p>Now when you hit "contact us" you will often be sent to an email form in which you have to fill out vital information about yourself before your message gets passed along. But seven out of 10 people just click the X button when those forms appear, according to random figures I just made up.</p>
<p>Handshakes.</p>
<p>These things have got to go. Even before H1N1 came along, shaking hands has been one of those weird, widely accepted traditions that none of us can avoid. Even when a known sweaty palmer extends his hand, it is impossible to reject it without breaking a major rule of society.</p>
<p>It's time to stop this virus-spreading exhibition. I'm not in favour of Dr. Sanjay Gupta's proposal (elbow bumps) either, but there has to be something else we can do to say, "Hi. Nice to meet you."</p>
<p>Oh I know, let's just say, "Hi. Nice to meet you. And can I have some money?"</p>

</div><div>Helen Branswell   </div>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Young children have such a strong immune response to the H1N1 vaccine Canada is buying that the country may end up lowering its recommendation on how many shots of vaccine kids need, the head of the Public Health Agency of Canada said Friday.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones said if additional results show the same protective response seen with one dose in the first clinical trial of the vaccine in children, a decision could be made to recommend children only get one shot of the adjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>"If we have that kind of level of response in kids . . . why would you stick them twice?" said Butler-Jones, the country's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>He said the scientific committees that are advising the public health agency on pandemic vaccine issues will need more data.</p>
<p>But Butler-Jones said that could be available by the time children are getting ready to get their second shots. The current recommendation for kids is for two shots given at least 21 days apart.</p>
<p>"We have some time to make the decision about whether the second dose is actually still needed or not," he said.</p>
<p>The results, released Friday by vaccine maker <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, were based on small numbers of children.</p>
<p>But they are, as Butler-Jones said, "very promising."</p>
<p>The company enrolled 200 infants and toddlers aged six months to 36 months in a trial in which they were given two pediatric doses of its pandemic vaccine delivered 21 days apart. The trial took place in Spain.</p>
<p>The dosing regime for adults with the vaccine is one shot containing 3.8 micrograms of antigen, the material in the vaccine that induces the immune response, plus an adjuvant, which is an additive that boosts the response.</p>
<p>The regime approved for children is two shots of 1.9 micrograms of antigen, each containing a half-dose of adjuvant.</p>
<p>Children under nine generally require two doses the first time they get flu vaccine, because their immune systems have had so much less experience with flu viruses than those of adults.</p>
<p>But when GSK tested the antibody response of 51 of the children before giving them the second dose, they saw that in all of the children antibodies spiked to the threshold regulatory agencies use as proof a vaccine will be protective.</p>
<p>"These results in young children provide clinically relevant information as they show the ability of the vaccine to induce a very high immune response suggestive of early protection after one dose, in a population where it is known to be difficult to raise such an immune response," Jean Stephenne, president of GSK Biologicals, said in a release.</p>

</p>
<p>Confirming for the first time that a second wave of the pandemic flu has a hold on Canada, public health officials are turning up the volume about the risks of the H1N1 virus in the face of anti-vaccine sentiment.</p>
<p>"This is a very real risk," Canada's chief public health officer warned. "Even in its mildest form, it's miserable and at its worst it kills or puts into ICUs and on ventilator support perfectly previously healthy, young people."</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones made his comments Friday in a teleconference as part of a full-court press to get every Canadian, 6 months old and older, inoculated against the pandemic virus.</p>
<p>And while children aged 9 and under are advised to receive two doses of the vaccine, new research indicates one may be enough, Butler-Jones acknowledged, urging parents to get their children vaccinated with the first dose and stay tuned for more information.</p>
<p>It's possible that 5 per cent of Canada's population has already been infected with the virus and that another 20 to 30 per cent could get it over the next 18 months, Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>All indicators are up in the pandemic's second wave, including the number of positive tests and the number of people doctors see with flu symptoms.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones drew parallels to the Spanish Flu of 1918-19, which contributed to the deaths of 50,000 Canadians.</p>
<p>Noting that Canada has ordered $300 million worth of vaccine, he said the cost would be much greater if preparations weren't in place.</p>
<p>The vaccine was finally approved this week, but one poll commissioned earlier this month by The Canadian Press and Harris Decima showed only a third of Canadians plan to get the shot.</p>

</p>
<p>It has become a tedious tradition for Westerners dealing with China to garnish their speeches with wisdom from the Chinese classics. Barack Obama, addressing Chinese and American leaders in July, used not just a banal quotation from Mencius, a Confucian sage, but a punchier one from Yao Ming, a Chinese basketball player: "No matter whether you are new or an old team member, you need time to adjust to one another." Though it has been 30 years since the two countries re-established diplomatic ties severed by the Communist takeover, both sides still badly need to adjust.</p>
<p>The heart of the problem is a profound uncertainty in both countries about where the relationship may lead. In many respects the two countries are in the same bed. Their economies have become interlocked, especially in the past decade. The United States is the world's biggest debtor and China its biggest creditor. From climate change to the economic recovery, the world faces problems that demand China and the U.S. work in concert.</p>
<p>Yet relations are dogged by fears of a new cold war, or even a hot one, breaking out. Some Americans in Washington, D.C., talk of China as "the new Prussia."</p>
<p>China has engaged in a rapid military build-up that could challenge the U.S. as the defender of Asian peace (and Taiwan's sovereignty). Unannounced, China is building its first aircraft carrier, yet its generals often refuse even to talk to their American peers.</p>
<p>Underlying the strategic competition is China's economic rise. Its companies are "colonizing" swaths of Africa and Latin America, cozying up to regimes Westerners shun. Its huge foreign-exchange holdings and its sniffing of bargains mean Chinese investment in the West will grow rapidly in the coming years. And to cap it all, China owns $800 billion of U.S. government debt -- enough to give it power of life and death over the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Tensions will get worse in the next few years for two reasons. The first is unavoidable: 2012 witnesses important political transitions in the form of elections in Taiwan and the U.S. and a Communist Party Congress in China. Second -- and more generally -- there has been a recalibration of perceived power. There is now talk of a G2 of China and the U.S., implying that their global weights are nearly equal. In fact, this is a misperception, and a dangerous one.</p>
<p>China's economy is still less than a third the size of the U.S.' at market exchange rates. Its gross domestic product per head is one-fourteenth that of the U.S. The innovation gap between the two countries remains huge. The U.S.' defence budget is still six times China's. As for the Treasury bills, dumping them is not an option for China: A tumbling dollar would hurt its own economy. And as American consumers spend less, while Chinese stimulus boosts its domestic spending, the huge and politically troublesome trade imbalances are shrinking. In the meantime, the danger of overegging China's economic expansion abroad is that it will fuel protectionism at a time when U.S. unemployment is painfully high.</p>
<p>In terms of geopolitical power, China has neither the clout nor the inclination to challenge the U.S. Confidently though China's leaders now strut the world stage, they remain preoccupied by simmering discontent at home: There are tens of thousands of protests each year. For all the economic progress, all sorts of tensions -- social, cultural, demographic, even religious -- haunt the regime and help explain why it resorts to nationalism so often. So it is odd, and wrong, that the U.S.' approach toward China is driven by its own insecurities.</p>
<p>To simplify enormously, the danger is that a frightened U.S. will be too tough on China over the economy, especially trade -- and not tough enough on human rights. On money matters, Obama's foolish decision to slap tariffs on Chinese tires has given dangerous encouragement to protectionists in the U.S. As unemployment there climbs inexorably towards 10 per cent, the pressure will grow for Congress to fuel a self-defeating attack on Chinese exports and the undervalued yuan. This is bad economics: Both China and the U.S. would lose enormously from a trade war.</p>
<p>If economic freedom is one U.S. value that Obama should not sacrifice on his first visit to China next month, the other is personal freedom. Chinese authoritarianism is not somehow more acceptable because China is a rising power, nor are human rights bargaining chips to be played only when expedient. That Obama needs Chinese help to fix the global economy and on climate change mitigation does not mean the leader of the free world should stifle criticism of its political system. Avoiding a meeting with the Dalai Lama in Washington this month was an unnecessary sop to his hosts. The Communist Party, keen to bolster its image at home, wants the trip to appear successful as much as Obama does.</p>
<p>A more confident approach is a bet on whose sort of system of government will prove ultimately stronger. At the moment China's responses on the climate, the financial crisis and the emerging swine flu pandemic have won it praise internationally. But they have also borne the hallmarks of an authoritarian system. For instance, on greenery, it is clear that if China had exposed its response to the rigors of democratic debate, it would have acted more slowly: China's system enables it to mobilize huge resources and make politically difficult decisions. But an effective long-term response to climate change needs public understanding of the issues and a legal environment that allows foreign owners of green technologies to transfer them without fear of theft. China lacks both.</p>
<p>Behind China's facade of strength, on stunning display with its parade of tanks and missiles through Beijing on Oct. 1, lie fretful frailties -- also on display that day, when spectators were banned for fear of protests. Social tensions in China are likely to rise, even as it grows richer. Locking up activists, as China has been wont to do recently, is not a lasting solution. Obama should meet some of them in Beijing to find out for himself. If his hosts have a hissy fit, let them.</p>

<p>If you're wearing a paper mask in public (and it's not Halloween), knock it off.</p>
<p>You're not protecting yourself from disease. You're panicking the people around you, who wonder which virulent illness you've got.</p>
<p>They're also wondering why you're not in bed if you're that seriously ill.</p>
<p>If you're sick, stay home. If you're well, don't lick any doorknobs.</p>
<p>It's not quite that simple but it's mighty close.</p>
<p>The spectre of H1N1 has caused waves of global panic. People have died. Many more will die. There is no taking this pandemic casually.</p>
<p>People in high-risk categories for becoming seriously ill or dying from H1N1 will be first in line for the vaccine Monday. Some people who aren't in the high-risk categories still want the shot as a precaution.</p>
<p>But there's some evidence folks are moving from flu cautious to kooky.</p>
<p>I've kept Clorox in business this year, wiping down phones, the fridge door and the door knobs in my house. If my kids have touched something, it gets the bleach treatment.</p>
<p>Is this an overreaction? I don't know. It makes me feel like I'm doing something.</p>
<p>My grocery store has anti-bacterial wipes by the carts. You can wipe off the germs of the person who came before you. I can't do anything about the guy who coughs on the produce but the cart is clean.</p>
<p>This level of enhanced cleanliness has become the new normal.</p>
<p>Some people, especially those who deal with the public, say they don't care if they're erring of the side of caution.</p>
<p>"There are a lot more people I see coughing into their arms," concedes Richard Holland, owner of Shefield Express at Grant Park Shopping Centre. He keeps a bottle of hand sanitizer on the counter.</p>
<p>"I notice the kids are taking it seriously. I had a group of kids in Grade 7 the other day. They all had their little hand sanitizers and they were using them. I don't know. Maybe it's trendy."</p>
<p>Holland and his staff sell lottery tickets, drinks and the like. He says seniors are a mainstay of his business and they're not changing their behaviour for any old bug.</p>
<p>"My staff get coughed on a lot," he says. "I'm making sure everyone on my staff goes for the shot."</p>
<p>Seniors Bill and Elsie Toothill say they're taking advantage of the vaccine.</p>
<p>"The best doctors in the world are saying you should get it," Bill Toothill says. His wife concurs.</p>
<p>"We've already had our seasonal flu shot," she says. "We're going to get the H1N1 vaccine too."</p>
<p>Elsie Toothill says she might only hesitate if she were a pregnant woman. They're a high-risk category but many expectant mothers are afraid of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Candice Homewood, 29, is one of those women. She's 15 weeks pregnant and has no intention of getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>"I think the media has blown this somewhat out of proportion," she says eating lunch at <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> with her husband Tyler. "I just don't pay much attention to it."</p>
<p>Tyler agrees. He practises good hand-washing techniques, he says, but that's as far as it goes. He's convinced a good blend of vitamins, minerals and healthy eating is all he needs.</p>
<p>A recent Jory Capital-Probe Research poll found that two-thirds of Manitobans are washing their hands more frequently since the virus became known. One in four adults reported using hand sanitizer. Approximately 20 per cent have started coughing into their sleeves instead of their hand. A handful of Manitobans have stopped shaking hands or begun wearing surgical masks or gloves.</p>
<p>Thirteen per cent said they aren't doing anything differently.</p>
<p>Dr. Sande Harlos, medical officer of health with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, says there's no reason for panic in the streets. Her best advice? Use common sense.</p>
<p>Cover your cough. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Not sure how long to wash? Sing your ABCs. Use hand sanitizer only when you can't get to soap and water. There's no need to wash your hands thoroughly and then use sanitizer.</p>
<p>"If you're thinking about it all the time, that's excessive. If you're not doing things you enjoy, not going out or denying yourself things you enjoy, that's excessive."</p>
<p>People who are well, Harlos said, should not be wearing masks.</p>
<p>"When you wear a mask you heighten fear. If you're sick you should stay home."</p>
<p>I heard much of this at my mother's knee. Wash your hands. Cover your mouth. If Harlos had added "stand up straight" she would have hit the trifecta.</p>
<p>If we can just find a way to make that guy stop coughing on the produce, I'll sleep a little bit easier.</p>
<p>Right after I get my shot.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mayans' ancient playground; The two Cancuns provide a taste of the Mayans' ancient playground</b>
</div><div>Gary May   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>1771 words</div><div>24 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>F6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>When the Mayans erected their majestic stone cities 1,000 years or so ago, they typically built in the tropical rainforests of Mexico and Central America. Tulum was unique among those cities -- the only one that was walled and the only one facing the water.</p>
<p>It's a fanciful but not entirely unlikely thought that like today's travellers, the ancients delighted in the region's shimmering turquoise Caribbean waters, endless beaches and blazing sunshine. Yet its isolation kept Cancun, just north of Tulum, out of the tourist spotlight until the 1970s. Since then, Cancun has grown from a slumbering fishing village into Mexico's showcase tourist paradise, a destination so varied in its appeal that it offers something for just about anyone's tastes.</p>
<p>Today there are two Cancuns: the city of half a million built around the downtown El Centro, and the hotel zone, a strip of shining towers that resembles Miami Beach, hugging a spit of land featuring sandy beaches facing the ocean and a palm-laced lagoon to its back.</p>
<p>Second World War American servicemen discovered the area's splendid opportunities for diving and snorkelling while they were stationed on Cozumel, just off the coast from Cancun. Jacques Cousteau paid a visit in 1959 and declared it a diver's dream. That, in combination with planning for the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, set the Mexican government to thinking. The concept of a mega-resort zone was hatched, and the first upscale hotels built on the beach strip in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Today, the opportunities for adventure -- for those who want more than rest and relaxation on the beaches -- are endless: you can try parasailing, diving, golf, tennis and deep-sea fishing. Nearby are Mayan archeological sites, little villages where you can find a quiet guest house, B&B and cantina. You can swim with the dolphins and snorkel around offshore reefs or in the world's largest natural aquarium. Most hotels offer excursions to area attractions and points of interest.</p>
<p>Indoors, entertainment ranges from discos to quiet piano bars, and there are world-class restaurants serving an array of international cuisine and authentic Mexican fare. There's shopping for all tastes and budgets, with high-end shops stocking designer labels.</p>
<p>Cancun offers more than 150 hotels and more than 25,000 rooms. The most coveted are those from which you can walk out onto your Caribbean-facing balcony and take in the warm sea breezes. Accommodation along the beach-facing hotel zone is generally more expensive than the more modest hotels and guest houses in El Centro. The zone, or strip, offers everything from villas and self-catering condos to five-star hotels, resorts and spas.</p>
<p>While the strip provides a broad range of shopping, the best places to find locally produced handicrafts and art pieces can be found in El Centro.</p>
<p>El Centro is easily and inexpensively reached by public transit or taxi. It has its modern facade, but interspersed there are generous pockets of authentic Mexican culture, entertainment, shopping and accommodation.</p>
<p>The two Cancuns represent separate worlds. Take the food, for instance, served in the area's 500 restaurants. The hotel strip has ample fine dining establishments as well as family-friendly buffets that let the kids fill up on hot dogs and fries while Mom and Dad indulge in more daring fare. But if you stick only to the hotel strip, you'll miss the tasty, authentic and economically priced local dishes available in El Centro.</p>
<p>Yucatecan food features plenty of fresh fish, marinated meats and poultry. It liberally employs limes and oranges with unique herbs to bring out all the best in the ingredients. Exciting entrees can be had for well under $10 US. Just hop on a bus that links the hotel strip to El Centro and begin to explore for the treats -- and after-dinner entertainment -- that await you.</p>
<p>Despite its allure, Cancun has come through challenging times of late. In 2005, Hurricane Wilma wiped out much of the resort's beaches and severely damaged hotels. The country's drug-related violence gave some tourists cause to reconsider a visit and earlier this year, Cancun's police chief was arrested in connection with the torture-murder of a government anti-drug fighter. More recently, several airlines suspended flights because of the swine flu and this summer a hotel was accused of stealing sand to bulk up its beaches, still suffering from the loss of sand in the 2005 hurricane. But reconstruction of the Wilma-damaged hotels is complete, the government is replacing the beaches along the 30-kilometre hotel strip in an environmentally friendly fashion and, in a sign of its confidence in the future, a second airport at Tulum is planned. And while advisories are occasionally released in connection with Mexico's drug-related violence, tourists are merely urged to take care in choosing their surroundings.</p>
<p>History buffs will want to take a tour to one of the nearby archeological zones such as the ocean-side Tulum, or the sprawling, jungle-bound Chichen Itza, a three-hour trip through the rainforest where you can climb the great pyramid and get a lesson in the highly developed Mayan culture. You'll hear that after the rainforest cities were abandoned, the vegetation grew so thickly that those who rediscovered the huge stone structures literally ran into them before understanding what they had found.</p>
<p>Along the way, visits to the colonial cities of Valladolid and Merida are well worth the effort. Colourfully dressed Mayan women sell their crafts in Valladolid's Plaza. Buildings in Merida were constructed from stone taken from earlier Mayan cities. Tours can be arranged from your hotel but if you're a do-it-yourselfer, staff will help you rent a car.</p>
<p>Cancun offers an abundance of nearby snorkelling venues. Xel-Ha is a salt-water lagoon and the world's largest natural aquarium, teeming with thousands of multi-coloured tropical fish. There, you can also swim with the dolphins. Offshore are Isla Mujeres and Cozumel, where you can snorkel or scuba dive along coral reefs.</p>
<p>If you're looking for Cancun's quieter side, head down the coast to the Riviera Maya where there are still world-class resorts, but fewer of them, and the pace is dialed back a notch. If you want to experience a more Zen-like existence, there's the modern town of Tulum, where resorts are often off the grid and the architecture might be described as upscale Gilligan's Island.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you'd like to slip back in time, to catch a glimpse of what Cancun was like before it was transformed into a holiday retreat. If so, head 30 kilometres south to Puerto Morelos, which offers hotels, guest houses and B&Bs in a quiet community of about 5,000.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>BEFORE YOU GO, IT'S GOOD TO KNOW ABOUT</p>
<p>- Weather. Cancun boasts a subtropical climate, with average daytime temperatures ranging from 27 C to 35 C and the landscape bathed in sunshine more than 240 days of the year. It rains more from May to October and there are occasional visits by hurricanes in September and October. Regular offshore breezes make temperatures at the resort more moderate than in the nearby tropical forest, which can be extremely hot and humid, even during January to March.</p>
<p>- Food and water. The purified water available from hotel taps is perfectly safe. It's advisable to drink only bottled water while exploring beyond your hotel. In the markets and while buying from street vendors, peel all fruits and vegetables and avoid lettuce. Go slow on the Mexican spices and style of cooking if you're not familiar with it.</p>
<p>- Clothing. Bathing suits should only be worn at the beach and pool. Dress is casual resort wear -- jackets and ties are rarely needed. But if you're headed to the disco, it's customary to dress up. Most nice restaurants and bars require men to wear slacks, although some allow Bermuda shorts.</p>
<p>- Medical care. Mexico has a nationalized health care system. In Cancun, medical care is close at hand and most hotels have a doctor on call 24 hours a day. No vaccinations are needed to enter Mexico.</p>
<p>- Shopping. El Centro offers plenty of authentic Mexican shopping. Expensive perfume can be purchased for one-third of what it costs in Canada. The hotel strip offers a glitzier, more expensive brand of shopping with plenty of designer labels available.</p>
<p>- Gambling. The only legal gambling in Mexico is sports betting. There are no legal casinos although some resorts hold casino nights in which participants play for prizes.</p>
<p>- Winter break. Families and empty nester couples should be aware that students from Canada and the U.S. flood into Cancun during their winter break weeks, just as they do in Florida, turning the strip into party central.</p>
<p>- On arrival. From the airport, you can take a shared shuttle or private service van or car to hotels. For information call 1-800-317-1921 or e-mail transportation@cancun-airport.com.</p>

<p>FACTBOX: DID YOU KNOW</p>
<p>- The Yucatan Peninsula was originally inhabited by the Mayans, who were expert mathematicians and astronomers and enjoyed a detailed understanding of the stars and the rotation of the sun. By the time the Spaniards arrived in 1519, their great cities, such as Chichen Itza, had already been abandoned.</p>
<p>- Cancun was identified in the late 1960s as a place well situated for development as a world-class resort. The first exclusive hotels were built in the 1970s, when Cancun was a small fishing village. Today the city has a population of about 580,000.</p>
<p>- Cancun was once called Ekab, or "black earth." Cancun means "pot of snakes" in the Mayan language.</p>

</div><div>Canwest News Service</div>

</p>
<p>Brentwood College School in Mill Bay is using its gymnasium as a temporary isolation ward for students suffering from H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Marius Felix, assistant headmaster of the Mill Bay private boarding school, said that as of Friday afternoon, 97 of the school's 435 students were suffering from flu-like illnesses.</p>
<p>Fifteen of the sick kids have been isolated in the school's health clinic and the remainder are in beds moved into the gymnasium.</p>
<p>Despite the disruption -- mostly felt by the school's basketball and volleyball teams -- classes and activities are going ahead.</p>
<p>"As far as we are concerned, even though we have a lot of sick kids, it's business as usual," Felix said.</p>
<p>He said two girls at the school reported two weeks ago they had flu-like illnesses with fever, cough, runny nose and body aches. Both have recovered. Since then, swabs have confirmed the girls were infected with H1N1.</p>
<p>The school, following advice from public-health officials, has stopped taking swabs and is simply isolating kids until they recover.</p>
<p>Late last month, H1N1 was confirmed at Shawnigan Lake School, another private school, after about 130 of 446 students fell sick.</p>
<p>On Friday, the school had no current cases. Like the Mill Bay school, it imposed isolation measures, keeping students on campus.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Misinformation on vaccines is highly contagious</b>
</div><div>Catherine D'Amico   </div>
<div>Citizen Special</div>
<div>939 words</div><div>24 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>I am a family physician and I am going to get my H1N1 flu shot and so are my children. I hope that my fellow Canadians will too.</p>
<p>Based on what occurred in the Southern Hemisphere during their winter this year, it is expected that about 80 per cent or more of the influenza virus circulating this year will be H1N1 and about 20 per cent seasonal flu.</p>
<p>There is a lot of misinformation being passed from person to person about the flu vaccine. And unfortunately many are simply accepting what they hear as fact.</p>
<p>Why do people who would never use <span class="companylink">Google</span>, or the opinions of friends and colleagues, to decide that they knew more than their lawyer, engineer or architect, decide that they know better than their physicians? Or the PhDs in immunology and microbiology and public health staff who research these issues for months to years, and have the scientific background to be able to truly evaluate the research and safety data?</p>
<p>How could all the scientists and physicians and governments in every province, state and country in the world who are all looking at the data and recommending vaccination be wrong?</p>
<p>Here are the facts: The seasonal flu vaccine and H1N1 vaccine are called subunit vaccines which do not introduce live or whole flu virus into the body. The flu vaccine delivers a minute quantity of a sterilized, purified portion of the influenza virus into the body. The immune system is then stimulated to respond and in about two weeks this results in immunity.</p>
<p>When someone gets the actual flu, they have had whole, live, influenza virus enter their body through their nose and mouth. The influenza virus attaches to the nasopharynx cells, then enters and reproduces within them. Millions and millions of live viruses are then released, teaming throughout the person's body and bloodstream. This is an overwhelming attack and as the battle ensues and the immune system fights, the temperature rises, the body fatigues, and the symptoms of influenza result. Most cases of H1N1 have been mild, but as we have seen, for some, and sometimes randomly, the battle is severe and death results.</p>
<p>Why would you choose for yourself, or much more importantly for your child, to come into contact with the live virus, and submit to millions and millions of live, replicating viruses circulating for days and days? Does it not make more sense to instead get a vaccine that injects a sterilized and killed tiny portion of that same virus? I have chosen this option for my children and for myself (including during my pregnancies) for over a decade and have no regrets.</p>
<p>The problem with subunit vaccines is that since they contain only a part of the virus, they often cannot stimulate a complete immune response, especially in those with weak immune systems such as young children, the elderly, or those with chronic diseases. For that reason, scientists add adjuvants to vaccines. Adjuvants are immune-system stimulators that enhance the response to the vaccine. (The October 2009 issue of Scientific American has a thorough article on vaccines and adjuvants.) The H1N1 vaccine contains an oil-in-water adjuvant called squalene. Squalene is a naturally occurring sterilized oil. Oil-in-water adjuvants have been studied and approved as safe and are used in various European vaccines including their flu shots.</p>
<p>Something that really puzzles me is how quickly people will put into their own and their children's bodies anything labelled as an immune stimulant if it is sold in a natural products store. These products do not have long-term safety data, are much less rigorously tested for safety than vaccines and adjuvants, and claims are often supported by very poor quality studies that were done by the very companies selling the product.</p>
<p>There is a question I am frequently asked: If the nurses, paramedics and hospital workers are not getting vaccinated, doesn't that suggest that I should be concerned about getting vaccinated?</p>
<p>It is interesting that the rate of vaccination among health-care workers is similar to the rate in the general population. The reason for this seems to be that health-care workers obtain their information about the vaccine and influenza in exactly the same way as the general public. They <span class="companylink">Google</span>, read newspapers and talk among themselves. There are no requirements for health-care workers to participate in any accredited educational programs related to vaccines or influenza.</p>
<p>To protect those at high risk from influenza, in whom the vaccine does not protect well due to their weak immune response, it is important that their caregivers be vaccinated so that they do not infect them. It is particularly concerning that health-care workers could infect or kill our most vulnerable by choosing not to be vaccinated. Research indicates that H1N1 is infectious one day before symptoms, and up to seven to 10 days afterwards.</p>
<p>H1N1 is now present in our community and will be spreading quickly. It's time for all of us to come together and protect ourselves and our families, and help to protect the vulnerable in our community. One way to do that is to get vaccinated. The vaccine takes two weeks to stimulate immunity, so it's important to be vaccinated as soon as it is available to you. That's what my family is planning to do.</p>

<p>The zeitgeist has been that the H1N1 flu virus has been taken a lot more seriously than the influenza strains that strike down hundreds of Canadians every year. But based on a new Ipsos Reid poll commissioned by Canwest News and Global Television, it looks as if public health officials will have their work cut out for them getting us to roll up our sleeves. They must get to work, and quickly, and we must begin to listen.</p>
<p>While a majority surveyed told pollsters they are concerned or very concerned that they or someone in their family might contract H1N1 in the coming months, 48 per cent said they are not likely to get the vaccine. And although the well-publicized virus seems to affect younger Canadians more than any other demographic, those between 18 and 34 are least likely to be vaccinated. In fact, even among those who claim they are worried about catching the potentially fatal bug, fewer than one in five say they are "very" concerned.</p>
<p>Other findings show widespread confusion as to how, where and when the vaccine will be administered. On the other hand, the vast majority polled expressed confidence in our public health officials and say they will stay home from work if symptoms occur. They also said they are changing their habits somewhat as a result of the threat, from washing or sanitizing hands more often to coughing into sleeves and resisting shaking hands.</p>
<p>It's foolish to conclude that the results of any snapshot of public opinion is definitive in itself. But even on the basis of anecdotal information, it seems clear that more could be done to at least explain when and where vaccines will be available locally. Getting them is a matter of choice. But even though a very few may become ill via the needle and the vaccine may not be effective in each case, surely the odds favour taking preventive action, if not for ourselves, then for our families, friends and co-workers. Some of the best minds in global immunology have been working on this for months. Better to take their best advice and avoid a killing pandemic at all costs. We've been warned and the authorities have responded. Now it's up to us.</p>

<div>680 words</div><div>24 October 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>R13</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

<p>You will by now have heard of swine flu, which sounds like swine flew, which suggests a new wrinkle on the skeptical phrase “when pigs fly.” Coincidentally, bird flu is an element of swine flu along with pig flu and human flu. Keen not to tar pigs as the sole culprits, the authorities have therefore taken to using the term “influenza A/H1N1.”</p>
<p>The trouble, as reader Edith K. Leslie observes, is that aitch-one-en-one is a cumbersome label. “By the time you have said it, you may already have caught it. So I am going to change the ‘ones' to I's (one often stands for the other in various scripts) and call it Hini, pronounced Heenee.”</p>
<p>But there are perils in adopting “hini.” Other words already occupy that territory, for better or ill, with varying pronunciations. Consider hinny, a Scottish and northern English variation on honey, similarly used as a term of endearment. The word doubles in those precincts as the name of a baked currant cake, a singing hinny or hinnie. We are left to imagine a virus that causes everyone to break into song, as the cast once did while under a demon's spell on the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.</p>
<p>Hinny also means to neigh, as a horse does, from the Latin hinnire (neigh). And if a stallion makes time with a female donkey, the offspring is a hinny, from the Latin hinnus. Charles Darwin mentioned this one in his writings: “Both the mule and the hinny resemble more close the ass than the horse.” You can see the problem. People would think H1N1 was really horse flu, or donkey flu, or – well, I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p>If hini were to acquire a long “i” in the first syllable, the complications would increase. “Heinie” has for almost a century been North American slang for the buttocks. Eugene O'Neill used it in his 1922 play The Hairy Ape: “Gee, pipe de heinie on dat one! Say, youse, yuh look like de stoin of a ferry-boat.” The word is still in wide use. Pat Overman, a spectator at a race of 350 dachshunds last August, was quoted by The San Diego Union-Tribune as saying, “Look at these guys running. Have you ever seen anything more comical? Their ears, their heinies, their legs – they are flying in the wind.”</p>
<p>While the direct origin of this meaning of “heinie” is simple enough, as a shortening of “behind,” the reference books also point to the influence of an ethnic slur. During the First World War, North Americans referred to the German enemy by many names, including Fritz, Jerry and, yes, Heinie, short for Heinrich or Heinz. In fact, wordsmith Eric Partridge and others have said that Canadians were more inclined than Americans to use Heinie as their epithet for German soldiers, though the word caught on internationally. The Oxford English Dictionary says that when hind-quarters were shortened to “heinie” during or just after the war, whoever did so probably intended a collateral swipe at the German foe.</p>
<p>Whatever its origin, the idea of heinie flu has already been broached. Mike Ivey, columnist for The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal, urged readers on Oct. 13 to refer to H1N1 as “Heinie Flu. … It's a takeoff on the scientific name for the H1N1 virus and has a nice ring to it.” It may also conjure up another use of Heinie, as a colloquial short form for Heineken beer. That phrase was used in August by actor Jack Black, part of the rock duo Tenacious D. Asked what substances the audience members at his concerts might be likely to indulge in, Black said they might smoke a joint, imbibe “a couple [of] Heinies and then call it a night.”</p>
<p>If beer could double as a vaccine for H1N1, life for a lot of people would be considerably easier.</p>

<p>The second wave of the H1N1 influenza is gaining momentum in southeast Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>In the past week, the Sun Country Health Region has had more than 20 lab-confirmed cases of H1N1, said Dr. Shauna Hudson, the region's medical health officer.</p>
<p>"Those individuals have had mild disease and wouldn't normally be tested, but we're doing more testing because we have an extensive surveillance system in Sun Country," Hudson said. "It's kind of a paradox -- if you have a lot of surveillance, you detect a lot of illness early."</p>
<p>She noted there has been a couple of viral outbreaks in long-term care facilities, but they were not H1N1 cases, she said.</p>
<p>"H1N1 is here, but other viruses are here too," Hudson said. "We have 40 schools participating in our surveillance, five long-term care facilities and two businesses that are spread throughout the region."</p>
<p>Most of the lab-confirmed cases in the Sun Country Health Region were school-aged children.</p>
<p>"We have an arrangement with our schools and our health district that any time a school reaches a 10-per-cent absenteeism rate due to illness, they notify us and we notify health," said Lynn Little, superintendent of learning supports with the South East Cornerstone School Division on Friday. "Today, we have five schools that have notified us that they have 10 per cent or greater absenteeism."</p>
<p>More than 7,800 students attend the division's 39 schools, which are spread over a large geographical area that includes the communities of Rocanville, Carlyle, Carnduff, Estevan, Fillmore, Pangman, Radville, Ogema and Yellow Grass.</p>
<p>On Friday, 91 students at Estevan Comprehensive High School were absent because of illness, but Little noted not all absences were lab-confirmed cases of H1N1. She couldn't provide a total number of ill students in the division, but estimated several hundred students were home sick on Friday.</p>
<p>"We don't have reports from schools that are under 10 per cent," she said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, 210 students attending schools that did report a 10-per-cent absenteeism rate were away ill. In addition, some schools had four or five teachers call in sick as well.</p>
<p>Anyone with flu-like symptoms are asked to stay at home to prevent the spread of the influenza.</p>
<p>"The parents have been very supportive," Little said. "We're asking them to keep the children home if they have symptoms for either five to seven days from onset or until they're symptom-free. That will certainly help to diminish the effect."</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus has not resulted in similar absenteeism in Regina schools.</p>
<p>"At this point, Regina public schools doesn't have any noticeable increase in absenteeism," said Regina Public Schools spokesman Terry Lazarou on Friday.</p>
<p>Nor has H1N1 impacted students or staff at Regina Catholic Schools, said Jennifer Cartwright, spokeswoman for the Catholic system.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus is present in Regina, but the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region has less than 20 lab-confirmed H1N1 cases.</p>
<p>Most people with mild symptoms do not need to see a doctor and should call Healthline at 1-877-800-0002.</p>
<p>The exception, Hudson said, are pregnant women and those with chronic or unstable health conditions, such as diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who have mild symptoms.</p>
<p>Adults who experience shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, an ongoing high fever or are disoriented should seek immediate medical attention.</p>
<p>"In children, the danger signs are similar to a lot of conditions -- they're not drinking enough fluids so there is a risk they will become dehydrated, they're not waking up as easily or they're unusually quiet," Hudson said. "If children have any difficulty breathing that isn't from a stuffy nose, they need to come in."</p>
<p>She urges all residents to get their H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.</p>
<p>"That's the best thing to prevent it," Hudson said.</p>
<p>H1N1 QUESTION OF THE DAY</p>
<p>Is the H1N1 a live vaccine? I understand Canada does not use live vaccines. Is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: The influenza vaccine cannot give you influenza. The influenza vaccine contains dead influenza viruses and they cannot cause infection. It is correct that Canada does not use live virus for influenza vaccines.</p>

<p>H1N1 swine flu has become widespread in 46 of the 50 U.S. states, a level comparable to the peak of ordinary flu seasons but far earlier and with more waves of infection expected, a top U.S. health official said on Friday.</p>
<p>"Forty-six states having widespread transmission is the peak of flu season. To be basically in the peak of flu season in October is extremely unusual," said Dr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Frieden said seasonal flu normally peaks sometime between late November and early March. And he noted that this virus was sickening young adults and children as opposed to seasonal flu, which usually hits people over 65 the hardest.</p>
<p>"We expect that influenza will occur in waves and we can't predict how high, how far or how long the wave will go or when the next will come," he told reporters in a telephone briefing.</p>
<p>Swine flu has killed more than 1,000 Americans and put more than 20,000 in the hospital in the United States since it emerged earlier this year, Frieden said. But health officials are quick to note that the actual number of cases cannot be measured. "We have had up until now many millions of cases of pandemic influenza in the U.S. and the numbers continue to increase," Frieden said.</p>
<p>In a separate statement on Friday, the World Health Organization reported more than 414,000 laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 worldwide, with nearly 5,000 deaths.</p>

<p>As the province gears up for a mass vaccination against the H1N1 or swine flu virus, the province's doctors say they expect to be too busy to write sick notes required by many employers.</p>
<p>"In order to help reduce the transmission of H1N1 and other illnesses, Ontario's doctors believe it is wise for patients to stay home when they have flu-like symptoms," said Dr. Suzanne Strasberg, president of the Ontario Medical Association, said Friday in a statement. Doctors need to see a patient before writing a sick note.</p>
<p>"Employers need to recognize that by requiring a sick note, they are encouraging those who are experiencing their worst symptoms and are most infectious to go out, when they should just be home in bed."</p>
<p>The association suggests employers simply trust their employees, adding that employees in turn should not take advantage of the situation to take time off.</p>

</p>
<p>Let's not be naive; all governing parties devote themselves not just to running government but also hanging on to power.</p>
<p>Opposition Liberals are insisting the Harper government has been putting far too much effort into the latter task.</p>
<p>The Grits are condemning everything from patronage-style political appointments to the use of public monies for advertising they say is partisan in nature.</p>
<p>Their objections once again are placing a spotlight on the "hyper-partisanship" that Stephen Harper has been criticized for in the past.</p>
<p>Politicking by governing parties is tricky. It can help them consolidate their base and gain public support but also can be damaging.</p>
<p>Remember the Chretien government's sponsorship scandal, revealing Liberal efforts to gain support in Quebec through advertising? The project reeked of cronyism and revealed fraudulent practices, ultimately doing in the Liberals.</p>
<p>Harper himself got a taste of the drawbacks of excessive partisanship last December when he proposed eliminating public subsidies for political parties, raising the ire of the opposition which subsequently withdrew support from the minority government. In the end, the PM had to seek a recess of Parliament to save his hide.</p>
<p>The latest controversy surrounding Conservative-style politicking has the Ignatieff Liberals themselves trying to gain political advantage by condemning Conservatives for spending tax dollars not so much with the public good, but themselves, in mind.</p>
<p>Liberals are unlikely to benefit because people remember their team getting up to the same shenanigans.</p>
<p>But among the stuff the Grits are balking at are mock government cheques for public works emblazoned with Conservative logos that irresponsibly leave an impression the party itself is forking over the cash.</p>
<p>Liberals, who report uncovering 47 instances since 2007 when MPs presented at least 181 such personalized, partisan cheques to constituents, are taking their complaints to the federal ethics commissioner.</p>
<p>The Liberals registered another objection earlier this month when the federal public works critic Martha Hall-Finlay complained to Treasury Board about the government's ad campaign promoting its infrastructure spending plan -- although the ads don't in fact cite the Conservative party.</p>
<p>Hall-Finlay said at least $56 million has been spent since January in "a spending spree on taxpayer-paid partisan advertising."</p>
<p>She noted the government, with much less to gain from an ad campaign on the H1N1 virus, has spent only a fraction of that informing Canadians about the possible pandemic.</p>
<p>Additionally, Liberals are complaining about too much of the infrastructure cash going to Conservative ridings.</p>
<p>The Harperites also have been strongly partisan in their appointments, with few exceptions naming Conservatives to order-in-council jobs.</p>
<p>They've also relentlessly attacked Michael Ignatieff in advertising, on their website and in constituency mailers in Liberal-held ridings.</p>
<p>Indeed, Conservatives are credited with destroying former Liberal leader Stephane Dion's image through similar advertising.</p>
<p>Ignatieff recently coined a phrase describing the Conservative modus operandi: "The politics of personal destruction."</p>
<p>What's interesting is that in the face of mounting Liberal complaints about Conservative partisanship, the Harperites' polling numbers have been going up, not down.</p>
<p>A poll Friday put Conservatives at 41 per cent, within reach of a majority government. This suggests Canadians are more concerned about economic issues than partisanship.</p>
<p>Or, it may be they've grown too used to government partisanship, after witnessing antics of the Mulroney and Chretien regimes.</p>
<p>Voters seem prepared to look the other way unless a government's partisanship involves the passing of envelopes stuffed with cash in restaurants with checkered tablecloths.</p>

<p>When local swine flu vaccination clinics kick off next week, those submitting to the needle will be a decidedly younger crowd than the usual turnout of seniors for flu clinics in past years.</p>
<p>That's thanks to the fact that thus far in Ontario about 75 per cent of those infected with H1N1 have been aged 30 and younger, and the old flu has been almost wiped off the map.</p>
<p>"In previous years our seasonal influenza campaign has been targeted against older individuals," Medical Officer of Health Dr. Allen Heimann said at a news conference Friday to announce the flu clinic schedule.</p>
<p>"This campaign is going to be targeted to younger individuals, those under 30, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions."</p>
<p>In past years the focus for the clinics has been "from the top down" on the age scale, Heimann said, but this year it's "from the bottom up."</p>
<p>The health unit received its initial shipment of 18,000 doses from Health Canada on Thursday evening and announced Friday the first public clinic will be held on Tuesday at the Tecumseh Knights of Columbus at 152 Lesperance Rd. from 2 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Those at greatest risk are health care providers, those under the age of 30 and those with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma, heart ailments, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes.</p>
<p>The vaccine shipped on Thursday is a so-called adjuvanted vaccine, with an adjuvant that helps improve the efficacy of the drug.</p>
<p>Women who are more than 20 weeks pregnant are recommended by Health Canada to get the adjuvanted vaccine, while those whose pregnancy is less than 20 weeks are recommended to wait for an unadjuvanted version.</p>
<p>In an effort to prove to the general public that the vaccine is safe, Heimann volunteered to have his own shot administered in front of the media after the news conference.</p>
<p>The first clinic will actually be for health care providers at the health unit building at 1005 Ouellette Ave. on Monday from noon to 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Doses of the vaccine are also being sent out to local hospitals to vaccinate their staff.</p>

<p>Re: The WHO's Political Pandemic, Michael Fumento, Oct. 22.</p>
<p>While most of the media act is if they are taking orders from the Swine Flu Ministry of Propaganda, Michael Fumento's excellent column raises serious questions of just who the WHO (World Health Organization) is.</p>
<p>This world body conveniently rewrote the definition of a "pandemic" to exclude a high mortality count. Then in June, it recommended that nations no longer test for the virus but just assume the virus is the culprit based on broad symptoms that could mimic any number of flu-like illnesses. Now it has been reported that U.S. labs are finding less than 1% of cases are testing positive for the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>This is a scandal of shameful proportions. Just "who" is pushing pandemic fever, and to whose benefit?</p>

</p>
<p>It was just six months ago that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that two children in California had developed a respiratory illness never before seen in humans, referring to the infection as "swine flu" in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.</p>
<p>That was on April 21. By May 1, the government of Egypt had slaughtered all of the country's 300,000 pigs, despite the fact not a single case of the virus had struck the nation. It was not long before major markets such as China and Russia blocked pork imports and families scratched ham off their grocery lists, even though the virus cannot be contracted by consuming properly cooked pork.</p>
<p>A month after declaring that "the whole of humanity is under threat," the head of the World Health Organization announced that H1N1 influenza had reached the pandemic phase, marking the first official global flu pandemic in 41 years. By July, Britain's Department of Health had recommended that women should "consider delaying conception whilst the pandemic is going on."</p>
<p>Around the world, school closures were ordered, churches were advised to drain their holy-water basins, hand-sanitizer sales have surged, and travellers fled the beaches of Mexico, where the H1N1 virus claimed its first victims.</p>
<p>"We must all be deeply concerned about the impact that even a moderate pandemic will have on vulnerable populations," said Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO during a speech delivered in June.</p>
<p>To be sure, the H1N1 virus is cause for concern. It has appeared in 191 countries, struck roughly 400,000 people globally and claimed the lives of at least 5,000 people. However the virus, a novel strain of influenza that can be treated with two widely available drugs and for which there is an effective vaccine, has killed fewer people over the past six months than the seasonal flu kills every six days. Yet fear of the flu has spread ferociously, as if H1N1 anxiety were more contagious than the virus itself.</p>
<p>"It appears that the global health community, including the WHO, is committed to worst-case thinking," said Frank Furedi, professor of Sociology at the University of Kent and author of Politics of Fear, Where Have All the Intellectuals Gone? "Health officials are today framing medical problems like H1N1 as threats to human existence."</p>
<p>For Mr. Furedi, much of the language surrounding the flu is inflammatory and does little more than instil a paralyzing paranoia among a species already programmed for fight or flight and which increasingly views any uncertainty as a threat. Fear, of course, can be a positive emotion that protects people from taking dangerous risks, and is partly credited for humankind's early abilities to survive. But fear can likewise manifest into debilitating paranoia, and prevent people from engaging healthily in society.</p>
<p>"Emphasizing possibilities rather than probabilities can cause alarm," Mr. Furedi said. "Health has been thrown into the current obsession with safety and security. It's a case of joined-up scare-mongering."</p>
<p>Indeed, in a twist from the traditional narrative, the H1N1 pandemic has been recast as a national security issue. In the WHO's 17th Pandemic 2009 Update, issued on Oct. 11, the organization said: "Systemic surveillance conducted by the Global Influenza Surveillance Network, continues to detect sporadic incidents of H1N1 pandemic viruses that show resistance to the antiviral oseltamivir."</p>
<p>Meantime, after a militant Egyptian Islamist group declared that H1N1 was "God's revenge against infidels," political pundits were quick to surmise that the virus could be deployed as an act of terrorism.</p>
<p>In a more subtle, but all the while security-framed tone, the U.K.'s Institute for Public Policy Research published a statement in August that said: "Over the past few months, the nature of the new security challenges we face has been highlighted by the rapid global spread of the swine flu pandemic. Experts have warned that several million people across the U.K. may be affected, with some predicting that in a worst-case scenario, as many as one in 200 people who contract the disease may die.... A more broadly based, joined-up and inclusive national security strategy is needed."</p>
<p>Since the first outbreak in the spring, health officials, medical journals and the media have repeatedly pointed to the 1918 Spanish Flu, which killed 50 million globally, as an example of the kind of havoc this new strain of influenza could wreak. This, Mr. Furedi said,</p>
<p>only serves to "transform the flu into an apocalyptic threat."</p>
<p>It is not the scientific comparison of the H1N1 virus to the Spanish Flu -- which was a subtype of the H1N1 strain -- that seems to perturb Mr. Furedi, but rather the manner in which the discussion is framed.</p>
<p>"By referencing the Spanish Flu as a model for what might occur, health professionals ignore the modern health systems of most Western countries."</p>
<p>Dan Epstein, spokesman for the WHO's Americas office, said that while the organization is cautious of the tone in its announcements, it does not consider people's psyche in determining whether a situation should be declared an outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. Instead, officials emphasize the transmissibility and threat posed by a given virus.</p>
<p>"The urgency in this instance was the increased number of cases and the very fact that this was a completely new virus that had never been seen before," he said. "We don't know what it can do."</p>
<p>Some onlookers argue that it is the fear experienced by bureaucrats themselves -- the fear of underestimating or underpreparing for a situation, much in the vein of Hurricane Katrina -- that drives this sort of worst-case mentality.</p>
<p>In 2005, the United Nations "flu czar" frightened the world when he announced that the Avian Flu could kill as many as 150 million people worldwide. The threat never materialized, but Mr. Epstein said the Avian Flu experience nonetheless led to years spent "beefing up" pandemic preparation plans.</p>
<p>This, some charge, presents an opportunity for health officials and pharmaceutical companies to cash in people's fear for the sake of political and economic gain.</p>
<p>Ms. Chan, the director-general of the WHO, raised the eyebrows of skeptics across the globe when, on June 11, she said: "The world can now reap the benefits of investments over the last five years in pandemic preparedness."</p>
<p>But Andre Leroux, CEO of medical-supply company Noveko International, was unprepared for the fury that has ensued since that April day.</p>
<p>Roughly 100 million of the company's anti-microbial masks are currently on back-order, and 20,000 litres of hand-sanitizer are being sold each and every day-- that is roughly the amount sold by the company in an average year.</p>
<p>"Our challenge is not sales, it's keeping up with demand," Mr. Leroux said.</p>
<p>"There's certainly a paranoia right now. People are definitely more conscious of the notion of clean air, it's part of the psyche now."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A vexing vaccine</b>

<div>National Post</div>
<div>1820 words</div><div>24 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine to be rolled out across Canada starting next week is in some ways a triumph of public-health science and logistics. Just seven months after the world woke up to the emergence of a brand new strain of influenza, it now has a vaccine that experts say will afford powerful protection against the generally mild, though occasionally lethal, pandemic bug.</p>
<p>Had something similar been in place during the 1918 flu emergency, it theoretically could have saved tens of millions of lives and staved off the greatest plague in human history. Why is it, then, that the large majority of Canadians seem more inclined to take their chances with the unpredictable new virus itself, than the vaccine that could shield them from it? According to opinion polls, as little as a third of people plan to get the flu shot, some citing fears of side effects and rushed testing, though public-health officials have repeatedly explained the risks are minimal.</p>
<p>Eager to avoid the kind of mistakes that bedevilled the fight against SARS, the federal government ordered 50 million doses of the vaccine at a cost of more than $400-million. Yet confusion and uncertainty bred by a myriad of media stories, assorted Internet commentaries and dogged anti-vaccine crusaders have left Canadians feeling at best ambivalent about the vaccine, experts say.</p>
<p>"I think that's most unfortunate," said Dr. Andy Simor, infectious-disease expert at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. "This really is one of the most important parts of our strategy for dealing with the pandemic.... If there's not that much uptake, there's that much more opportunity for the virus to spread."</p>
<p>It was just a few months ago that authorities were under intense pressure to acquire an adequate supply of the vaccine before the second, potentially more virulent wave of the H1N1 virus hit this fall. Somehow, the tide has turned and earlier fear of the pandemic strain has in many cases been replaced by anxiety about the vaccine.</p>
<p>"I don't believe in the flu shot," said a typical posting on a Canadian news website this week, which went on to suggest the vaccine could have the same effects on pregnant women as Thalidomide. "I refuse to be a guinea pig."</p>
<p>An Ipsos Reid survey for Canwest News Service released yesterday suggested that barely half of Canadians were even somewhat likely to get the shot.</p>
<p>"Public health is in a situation where it can't win," Dr. Simor said. "On the one hand, people are complaining, 'We're about to embark on the pandemic, you didn't get the vaccine out soon enough.' On the other hand, people are saying, 'How can you rush its manufacture?' "</p>
<p>As much as authorities have tried to feed the public a coherent and consistent message, a number of controversies have turned the picture fuzzy in many minds, said Dr. Kumanan Wilson, a public-health expert at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>There is the debate over still-unpublished evidence that reportedly indicates people who had the seasonal flu shot last year were more likely to contract H1N1; the question of the adjuvant added to the vaccine to make it stretch further; and the concern that an expedited regulatory process might let safety problems slip through.</p>
<p>Experts seem unanimous, however, in dismissing the oft-cited fears about the vaccine, made in Canada by GlaxoSmith-Kline under the brand name Arepanrix. Although speeded up somewhat, the manufacturing and approval processes for the vaccine differs little from that for the seasonal flu, say infectious-disease specialists. Flu vaccine contains a killed or weakened chunk of virus, which triggers the body to create antibodies against the disease.</p>
<p>Health Canada issued its approval this week, after preliminary results from trials of a version of Arepanrix made by GSK in Germany, and tests of similar vaccines in Australia, Europe and the United States showed a strong efficacy in most recipients, and similar side effects to those produced by the seasonal vaccine. The pandemic influenza now seems similar in severity to the seasonal flu, though it is much more likely to sicken young people, experts say. Because the young are more resilient than the usual elderly flu patients, that might mean a lower death rate in the end.</p>
<p>Yet it is still a serious illness, with some people in the prime of their lives ending up in hospital or dying, notes Dr. Donald Low, a microbiologist with the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion. "The theoretical risk from getting vaccinated is far outweighed by the risk of disease," he said. "There is just no comparison."</p>
<p>Concern in Canada has centered around the addition to the pandemic vaccine of adjuvant, a mixture of oil, water and vitamin E that torques up the immune response, meaning less vaccine is needed and supplies can be spread further. The United States is not using adjuvant in its vaccine. Some fear the substance might spark a dangerous auto-immune reaction in recipients, though there is no evidence of that happening.</p>
<p>In fact, adjuvanted vaccine has been used on about 22 million Europeans without ill effect, noted Dr. Wilson. It has not been tested on pregnant women or very young children, prompting the federal government to order 1.5 million doses of unadjuvanted vaccine for those groups, expected to be available next month. Dr. Simor, however, said he would strongly urge pregnant women -- who have been disproportionately hit by the H1N1 bug -- to take the vaccine with adjuvant now, as the risk from contracting the flu itself is far greater. Despite the reassurance from most experts, there are some dissident opinions being voiced on the overall value of such pricey, mass flu-vaccine programs.</p>
<p>Ontario launched the world's first universal, free flu-shot program in 2000, at a current cost of $23-million a year. A 2008 review found that flu deaths, hospitalizations and doctor visits all dropped faster in Ontario than other provinces in the years after the program started.</p>
<p>A small group of researchers, though, questions studies that suggest there are half as many deaths during flu season among elderly people who are inoculated as among those who are not.</p>
<p>They argue that the fewer deaths are a result of the fact that vaccine consumers tend to be healthier and more affluent: in other words, less likely to get sick or die from anything.</p>
<p>The mortality benefits of vaccination "may have been largely overestimated," a group of University of Alberta researchers concluded in a study published last year in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.</p>
<p>It is true that senior citizens respond less vigorously to flu vaccine than younger people, said Dr. Allison McGeer of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, one of the country's leading flu experts.</p>
<p>She dismisses the "healthy-user effect" research, however, noting that randomized controlled trials -- the gold standard of medical research, comparing vaccine against a placebo injection -- have shown the vaccine is effective in people over 65 and saves the heath-care system money.</p>
<p>"That kind of controversy is really attractive to people," Dr. McGeer said of the critics' work. "But I'm sorry, it's just nonsense."</p>

<p>Health Canada authorized the use of the H1N1 vaccine on Wednesday, which means local public health authorities will start offering the drug to their populations starting Monday. With the second wave of the pandemic influenza virus already here and well-established in places like British Columbia, Alberta and Northwest Territories, public health authorities are encouraging Canadians to get the swine flu shot. There's enough ordered for everyone who needs and wants it.</p>
<p>But Canadians have many questions: Is the vaccine safe? When should I get it? Do I need to get it if I was sick in the spring?</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious diseases prevention and control at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, and Globe and Mail reporter Caroline Alphonso held an H1N1 discussion.</p>
<p>Dr. Gardam has been medical director of the tuberculosis clinic at the Toronto Western Hospital since 2000, and of the Infection Prevention and Control Unit at the University Health Network since 2001. Recently he assumed a director role at the newly formed Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion. He is also an assistant professor of medicine and faculty at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. Dr. Gardam has acted as a consultant on infection control issues such as SARS, tuberculosis, pandemic influenza and C. difficile, at the provincial, national and international level. Within Canada, he has helped a number of hospitals control outbreaks and develop their infection control programs.</p>

</p>
<p>WATERLOO</p>
<p>He has the war wounds to go with his first world duathlon championship, but Waterloo's Ron VanKoughnett never envisioned another price to be paid.</p>
<p>After VanKoughnett, 65, captured the world title in his age group in Concord, N.C., earlier this autumn, complete with a bike crash at a blazing 40 kilometres an hour, he fell ill with what he suspects is the dreaded H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Crossing the finish line first in the 65-69 age group, or 289th overall in a field of more than 600 competitors, brought with it the requisite handshakes, kisses and impromptu autograph sessions that champions provoke.</p>
<p>His victory invited the kind of close contact with the germ-spewing, albeit well-meaning, masses that medical professionals have urged us to avoid.</p>
<p>A few days after returning to his Waterloo home, bone-crushing fatigue smacked VanKoughnett between the eyes. He slept 16 hours a day for a week. Other telltale symptoms like fever, chills and a spiteful cough told him this was no ordinary illness.</p>
<p>Nearly a month after the event - which included a 10-kilometre run, a 40-km bike ride, followed by a five-km run - the retired English teacher from Bluevale Collegiate said he still feels the lingering effects of the sickness.</p>
<p>And VanKoughnett, a former high school cross-country running and football coach, still bears the 45-centimetre (18-inch) gashes along his leg from that bike wipeout.</p>
<p>It was a hair-raising smash-up, even by his standards.</p>
<p>"All I could think about was getting back on my bike."</p>
<p>Except for his unpleasant brush with a nasty form of flu, there's no slowing the guy down.</p>
<p>VanKoughnett simply loves to train, mostly by himself, for hours on end during which he can plot his next victory at his leisure.</p>
<p>"I savour it," he said of his regimen that sees him cycling around Waterloo Region and environs for three-hour, 100-kilometre jaunts.</p>
<p>"I guess I like punishing myself.</p>
<p>"Some people drink, or eat, or listen to music. This is my therapy."</p>
<p>That world championship exacted its pound of flesh, its lost week and seven months of obsessive training.</p>
<p>And VanKoughnett wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
<p>"It's worth it for sure."</p>
<p>Ron VanKoughnett, 65, is the world champ for his age group in duathlon - a 10-kilometre run, 40-km cycle, then a five-km run. David Bebee, Record staff    </p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Area clinics begin offering pandemic and seasonal flu shots together late next week.</p>
<p>"We just finalized our schedule," Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health communications manager Jan Craig said Thursday in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Her public health board will offer the large-scale public clinics in eight locations throughout the area at various times and places from Oct. 30 through Dec. 23 for pandemic H1N1 and seasonal flu strains, which are currently circulating not only in the region but across other parts of the world.</p>
<p>It's safe to offer both sets of inoculations from a scientific perspective, local Medical Officer of Health Dr. Nicola Mercer reported.</p>
<p>Craig stressed they won't be combined into one injection. Instead, it'll require two - one shot in each arm. But it means people can have them both in one visit.</p>
<p>Supplies of the H1N1 vaccine were expected to arrive late yesterday.</p>
<p>Over the next week, the shots will be provided first to higher-risk populations in local hospitals and long-term care facilities before the public clinics.</p>
<p>Quantities of vaccines will also be made available to local physicians for their patients.</p>
<p>The Guelph clinics that begin late next week are at College Avenue Public School, 195 College Ave. W. Clinics are also offered in Fergus, Orangeville, Shelburne, Erin, Drayton, Palmerston and Mount Forest.</p>
<p>The full fall flu clinic schedule is available at the public board's website: www.wdghu.org[http://www.wdghu.org] or on its flu hotline, 1-800-265-7293, ext. 4161.</p>

</p>
<p>Our day of reckoning approacheth.</p>
<p>Organizers of the Wellness Initiative are arranging the baseline clinics they've been promising registered participants, for early November, where five measurements will be taken. This will give researchers a starting point. We'll all be remeasured after a period of time to see if the Wellness Initiative improves any of those markers of health.</p>
<p>Three clinics are set for November where registered nurses will measure:</p>
<p>Blood pressure (using an automated machine)</p>
<p>Blood glucose (using a simple finger pin prick test)</p>
<p>Balance (this is a one-legged or alternate standing test)</p>
<p>Flexibility (this is a sit and reach test)</p>
<p>Body Mass Index (height, weight, waist and hip)</p>
<p>Since starting tai chi classes and dusting off my yoga tapes, I know my balance and flexibility have improved, so I'm not worried about those numbers.</p>
<p>I don't think the blood pressure or blood glucose tests will yield troubling figures either, but I guess I'll find out soon enough.</p>
<p>The number I'm most concerned about is the body mass index. I haven't weighed myself in a long time and am a little worried at knowing that number.</p>
<p>After years of being preoccupied and dissatisfied with my weight I finally had enough. I had dieted, I had exercised, and for 20 years I had mixed success but inevitable failure. It wasn't an eating disorder exactly, but it was an unhealthy preoccupation.</p>
<p>Eventually I realized that regardless of whether I'm up or down five or 10 pounds, I still have to do my job, feed the kids, clean the house and pay my bills.</p>
<p>The bank doesn't care how much I weigh - they just want the mortgage payment, in full and on time. My efforts to win a round or two in the Battle of the Bulge didn't affect the greater worries in my life, so in a symbolic gesture, I took my bathroom scale and planted it in the garden, to be used as a stepping stone. Since then I've collected several more and I now have quite a path leading through my vegetable garden.</p>
<p>The scales aren't accurate. On one scale I weigh in at zero; on another I'm 350 pounds. Some of the needles still move when you step on the scale and others are rusted in place.</p>
<p>I don't need to know the number to know if my pants are getting snug. There's nothing wrong with trying to be healthy; it was the quest for the number that was futile.</p>
<p>So it's nice that the clinic is going to disguise my weight by wrapping it into a calculation that includes my height, waist and hip measurements.</p>
<p>The experts can explain what that number means. I can remain happily in the dark.</p>
<p>Wellness takes a holiday; foiled by the common cold</p>
<p>I think I'm coming down with a cold and that has me reviewing the H1N1 info we recently received from our human resources department.</p>
<p>Not that I think I have H1N1. Everyone who feels the slightest bit yucky these days begins to wonder if they have the dreaded swine flu. I've got the raspy throat and fuzzy head that foretells of a cold, plain and simple.</p>
<p>No need to panic. Frankly, I'm getting tired of H1N1 being the top story on the evening news every night. I'm in no hurry to count myself among their ranks. Nor am I into fear-mongering.</p>
<p>But I am surprised that in this day and age, some 60 years after the deadly outbreak of the Spanish flu and 150 years after Florence Nightingale and the Crimean War, public health still has to remind people to wash their hands and to clean and disinfect frequently touched items.</p>
<p>I'll be washing my hands until they are raw, and when the cold is over, I'll wipe down my keyboard, phone and desk in the office with a disinfectant.</p>
<p>Ditto those actions at home.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'm going to head to bed early these next few nights and see if I can head this off before it turns into something. And don't be upset if I don't shake your hand.</p>
<p>Believe me, I'm doing you a favour.</p>
<p>Live long and prosper</p>
<p>Louise Jessup at the Advanced Foods and Materials Network alerted me to a wellness project going on in Albert Lea, Minn.</p>
<p>They call their initiative the Vitality Project and have spent 10 months encouraging residents of that city to eat better and exercise more.</p>
<p>Cooking classes, community gardens and walking clubs sprang from the initiative. Local restaurants added healthier fare to their menus and grocery stores promoted more nutritious foods.</p>
<p>The net result: participants have added 3.1 years to their lives by adapting healthier lifestyles.</p>
<p>I hadn't thought about adding years to my life while diving into the Guelph Wellness Initiative. I had hoped to add some life to my years though.</p>
<p>Either way, it's encouraging to know that other cities are having success with projects like ours. It will be interesting to see how we fare as a city as we get deeper into it.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON</p>
<p>A new poll suggests most Americans don't plan to get inoculated against H1N1 even as the virus spreads across the United States, hundreds of schools close and politicians on Capitol Hill fret about an inadequate supply of the vaccine.</p>
<p>The Washington Post/ABC News survey, published Thursday, suggests many Americans are wary of the H1N1 flu shot. About six in 10 respondents said they have no plans to get vaccinated, and only 52 per cent of parents said they would get their children the vaccine.</p>
<p>This despite hordes of people showing up at the few clinics in the U.S. this week that have managed to snag doses of the elusive vaccine. Hundreds of schools have been closed in 15 states because of H1N1 flu, with more than 65,000 students affected.</p>
<p>Canada, on the other hand, has an adequate supply for its population.</p>
<p>Sen. Joe Lieberman told a Senate committee that the American shortfall of swine-flu vaccine is a result, in part, of countries like Canada choosing to make their own populations a priority. Ottawa pressured Canadian manufacturers to take care of the needs of the Canadian population before they could make vaccine available to the U.S., Lieberman said.</p>
<p>"It's exactly what we would do with an American producer, and it just puts an exclamation point on the importance of developing domestic capacity for production of vaccine in these cases," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pap smear campaign misses local doctors</b>

<p>No doctor in Hamilton or Burlington is taking part in a national campaign to get women easy access to pap tests.</p>
<p>The "smear campaign against cervical cancer" lists clinics and doctors' offices where women with no family physician can go next week to get a pap test.</p>
<p>But only 30 cities across Canada have doctors taking part, including nine in Ontario. The closest to Hamilton is Toronto.</p>
<p>The problem appears to be a combination of inadequate promotion of the campaign by organizers and bad timing.</p>
<p>Few family doctors were informed of the campaign and next week's public health priority is H1N1 flu shots, not pap smears.</p>
<p>"Nobody's heard of it," said Dr. David Price, head of family medicine at Hamilton Health Sciences and McMaster University. "Certainly, nobody has asked."</p>
<p>The Hamilton Academy of Medicine, which is an association of area doctors, also couldn't find any physicians who had heard of the smear campaign or been asked to take part by organizers at the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, the Society of Canadian Colposcopists and the Federation of Medical Women of Canada.</p>
<p>"The goal next year is to reach every community," said Dr. Sheila Wijayasinghe, who is a member of the federation and a Toronto family doctor taking part.</p>
<p>She said there are twice as many clinics taking part this year compared with the first campaign last year.</p>
<p>"We're learning every year," she said.</p>
<p>Even if local doctors had been informed, it's doubtful they could take on extra pap tests next week when H1N1 flu shot clinics start.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately for them, it's really bad timing," Price said. "Even if I had signed up for this, I'd probably be cancelling my participation so I could work on H1N1 over the next week. That's going to be the priority in the short term."</p>
<p>Organizers say they run the campaign on the same week every year and it's just bad luck it ended up being at the same time as the H1N1 clinics.</p>
<p>Regardless, doctors say the goal of the campaign is a worthy one because only about 70 per cent of women get a regular pap smear to screen for cervical cancer.</p>
<p>For some women, access is difficult, especially in cities such as Hamilton, which is short more than 40 family doctors.</p>
<p>"The concept is great," Price said. "That's obviously what you want to do. You want to try and have 100 per cent."</p>

<p>Cleveland Browns coach Eric Mangini hopes to have most of his starters available for Sunday's National Football League game against Green Bay despite a flu outbreak that has affected a dozen players.</p>
<p>Mangini said Thursday that two of the 12 players who were sent home from practice on Wednesday with flu-like symptoms were diagnosed with influenza A, of which the H1N1 virus is a sub-type.</p>
<p>Mangini said he was working on the "presumption" that the players with influenza A have swine flu, but said he didn't know if any of the other cases were.</p>
<p>However, he said that the team was speaking with the NFL about whether they were eligible to make use of special roster rules designed to help teams hit by swine flu.</p>
<p>If a team has a minimum of six players with confirmed cases of H1N1, the league will allow the team to use practice squad players in games.</p>
<p>"We're going through the process of talking to the league and documenting different things to see where we are with that," Mangini said. "We want to be sure what we're able to do and not able to do."</p>

<p>My college son texted me after a particularly hard test at school the other day.</p>
<p>"Bombed it," the text read.</p>
<p>I wanted to respond with my support.</p>
<p>But does "Bombed it" mean he aced the test?</p>
<p>Or that he flunked it?</p>
<p>Did I need to reply: "Oo, so sorry, d00d!"?</p>
<p>Or was the correct response: "You are off the hinges, man!"?</p>
<p>The way I saw it, this was one of those make-it-or-break-it moments in parent-to-child relations. How I replied to "Bombed it" would forever cinch my role as either a) a hip, Abercrombie parent who soooo could use a bikini butterfly tattoo or as b)a poser, a Twitter wannabe, a frumpy middle-aged mama ready for the glue factory and the elastic waistband crowd.</p>
<p>Carefully weighing my options from the grocery store parking lot where I sat with my cellphone, I considered the many slang uses of the word "bomb." Some of them I knew to be good, suggesting an aced test. Some of them I knew were bad, suggesting imminent flunkage, to wit:</p>
<p>"That concert was the bomb," for example, is usually good.</p>
<p>"I heard Gordo got bombed at Guido's the other night," meanwhile, is bad, if you hate hangovers and/or you're watching The Sopranos.</p>
<p>But then, "Yo, homey, that sound coming outa your box is the bomb dot com" is good, assuming you like music.</p>
<p>No wonder I'm confused. And while I'm at it, I think of the other confusing pop lingo to which my kids and The Office have exposed me.</p>
<p>You'd think "sick," and "wicked," for example, would be bad--since one means you might have the H1N1 flu and the other is attached to Dorothy's nemesis at Oz. Only they're not, especially when "bad" really means "bad," which it often doesn't.</p>
<p>Same with "dope." Everybody knows the slang word "dope" means either a doofus, or drugs--both of them suggesting negative connotation. But then I think about the blog my son started for his sister's high school soccer team weeks before the "Bombed it" txt event. Writing about the goalie, who is a totally sick, wicked dudette in the goal box, my son said: "Abby B. is dope."</p>
<p>I was thinking at the time that "dope" is a doofus on heroin, which I know Abby B. is not. Just to be on the safe side, I yelled down to my son after I read the blog, "You DO think Abby B. is a good soccer player, right?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, mom, dope is a good thing," he yelled back. I could almost hear him roll his eyes. He was on to me.</p>
<p>He's been on to me for weeks, which made this "Bombed it" thing uber critical mass.</p>
<p>My son knows -- simply by virtue of the fact that he is 21--that he is hip. He doesn't need Urban Slang Dictionary.comto tell him that "bra" has replaced "bro," that "sweet" and "epic" are good and "wack" is bad, that "ure trippin'," "you so Obama," and "shawty" are all in the zone, and exactly what does this e-mail mean that I got from another hipster wannabe parent in response to my call for lingo lessons: "I will keep your wack project in the dome while I practise my stale-fish 540"? My son's mother, meanwhile, clings to the periphery of hip.</p>
<p>He gets his hipness by being.</p>
<p>I get mine by living in the same house with hip, and by clinging to memories of my days as a groovy chick.</p>
<p>I sat in the grocery parking lot and typed in the letters "Y-A-A-A-Y" and three exclamation points.</p>
<p>I clicked send. And I waited.</p>
<p>His reply: "Uh, Mom, I didn't do well on the test."</p>
<p>I may be a poser, but at least I was thinking the best of my son.</p>

time keeping up with the lingo.

<div id="hd"><b>Change in libido could signal an underlying health-related issue</b>
</div><div>Ellie Tescher   </div>
<div>Freelance</div>
<div>800 words</div><div>23 October 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Q: I've been with my boyfriend for close to four years and we've always had a good sexual relationship until the last year. He was living overseas for over a year and we had survived the "long distance relationship;" he came back a few times and I had gone overseas to visit him, and everything was great.</p>
<p>Since he returned, he's been having performance issues that he initially said were caused by stress. Now he says that he has no sex drive. We've almost come to a complete stop in our sexual relationship. I know that he loves me deeply and everything else in our relationship is great, but this is starting to tear us apart.</p>
<p>He's still very loving in every other way but he doesn't think that this is a big issue. He thinks I'm putting too much value on this matter.</p>
<p>I know that there's no one else in the picture and it's not because of any change in body image.</p>
<p>The more I talk about it, the more frustrated I seem to make him.-- What to Do?</p>
<p>A:Your boyfriend has to stop brushing this off as a "not big" problem; and you have to handle the discussion as a couple's challenge, rather than something he's experiencing alone.</p>
<p>Love "in every other way" is only satisfying to the partner--you--if you truly feel satisfied. If so, drop the topic, enjoy the intimacy you do have and hopefully, without pressure, he'll look into what's happened to his libido.</p>
<p>However, you should both know that the change in his sexual behaviour could have a health-related basis, including health changes, medications, emotional problems, and/ or addictions. He should be checked out by his physician.</p>
<p>If pronounced clear, sexual counselling would benefit you both. But if he refuses, you then need to decide how long you're willing to put up with his do-nothing attitude about what is your sex life, too.</p>
<p>Q:I experienced a romantic obsession with someone else during my marriage, many years ago. I think it's important to point out to people that these feelings often come during a lull in your committed relationship, when someone you might be attracted to comes into your life (often work-related).</p>
<p>My solution was to talk to my husband about what I was feeling. All I did was confide in him in a calm, quiet moment that I was worried that I had feelings for someone.</p>
<p>His response couldn't have been better: "I don't think you can work so closely with someone, especially someone who was such a great mentor to you, without loving them a bit."</p>
<p>That was all I needed to hear and it was the last I thought of that man in a romantic way! People are often sharing their concerns or feelings with a friend or family member instead of with the one they should be --their spouse! I don't talk to my friends or mother or sister about any problems I might have in my marriage... the only person I discuss it with is my husband!--Loving Lesson Learned</p>
<p>A: Lucky you to have such an understanding partner. He's lucky, too, that you trusted him with the information and believed you could deal with it together.</p>
<p>The workplace is a common breeding ground for crushes and romantic feelings, especially for those whose marriages are already stressed. Recognizing the danger signs at work and at home means you can first try to save the marriage.</p>
<p>Q: My daughter's in kindergarten and I've found many annoying problems with her teachers, e.g. they don't have a scheduled bathroom time and my daughter wet herself several times, because she's too embarrassed to ask aloud to "go."</p>
<p>They make a verbal fuss about keeping hands clean, as part of H1N1 flu prevention, but they often run out of hand sterilizer.</p>
<p>I've complained, and now I feel they see me as That Pesky Mother. But aren't I supposed to protect my child?--Upset Mom</p>
<p>A: Yes, you have a right and duty to protect your child, but your approach can either be off-putting (such as blaming and angry) or helpful (such as organizing parent volunteers). Remember, a roomful of kindergarten kids can be very demanding.</p>
<p>Be sure to also compliment the teachers on the progress your child makes and note when she's been particularly happy with an activity or program they've planned.

<p>Taiwanese authorities are probing child-abuse claims against a school that allegedly made pupils as young as six swallow fire to boost their courage, a report said Thursday. The case came to light after parents complained they'd paid $293 for a five-day course only to find out their children were asked to swallow fire, said the TVBS news channel.</p>

<p>Re: "Get that flu shot as soon as possible" (Editorial, Oct. 22).</p>
<p>This is excellent advice, but it might not convince those who are doubting or undecided to do so.</p>
<p>In the past ,many of us received the annual flu shot from our doctors and it was they who arranged to get the vaccine in their offices.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the procedure for immunization against H1N1 is different, and many of us associate the vaccination program with government, which we trust far less than we do our doctors. As far as discussing the vaccine with our doctors, they are all so busy that their advice will come too late to help us decide.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>High-risk groups to be first in line for H1N1 vaccine; West Quebec region set to start inoculating residents on Monday</b>

<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>764 words</div><div>23 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>With an initial 19,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine being shipped to the region, West Quebec is expected on Monday to start inoculating health-care workers and people with a high risk of complications from swine flu. But most of the region's 350,000 residents will have to wait until mid-November to roll up their sleeves.</p>
<p>Outaouais officials unveiled the broad outlines of a vaccination plan Thursday, one day after the federal government gave its stamp of approval to the pandemic vaccine.</p>
<p>Dr. Guy Morissette, the Quebec Health Ministry's director of medical services in the Outaouais, said the province plans to release more details in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>In the meantime, West Quebec's five health and social service centres (CSSS) have been charged with organizing the vaccination clinics, starting with those at the front of the line -- the 20 per cent of the population who are health-care workers or belong to groups at risk of developing flu-related complications. These include people with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes and kidney failure. Priority will also be given to pregnant women and young children.</p>
<p>Starting Monday, each CSSS will notify people in the priority groups about where and when they can get the vaccine, said Morissette.</p>
<p>After that, depending on how much vaccine is delivered to the region, each CSSS will run mass vaccination clinics, where the majority of the general public are to get their shots.</p>
<p>Those clinics could start around Nov. 9 and continue through Christmas, said Dr. Helene Dupont, director of the Outaouais' public health unit.</p>
<p>Fourteen mass clinics are planned across the region.</p>
<p>Since Aug. 30, West Quebec has had 66 lab-confirmed cases of H1N1, nine requiring hospitalization. Of those admitted to hospital, six were children under 18, including one who needed to be treated in an intensive-care unit.</p>
<p>In total, the region has recorded 118 lab-confirmed cases and one death since the start of the pandemic in April.</p>
<p>Despite a chronic shortage of doctors and nurses, officials expect to have enough staff -- about 140 people a day -- to administer the vaccine. A core group of nurses will be needed, but a majority of the shots are expected to be given by trainee nurses, said Dupont.</p>
<p>For now, Quebec health officials are stressing prevention and education.</p>
<p>People are encouraged to wash their hands frequently, cough into the crook of their arm, and stay home if sick. A brochure is available to help people decide if they should visit a doctor or a hospital emergency room, based on their symptoms.</p>
<p>Even so, the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario has reported seeing a rising number of West Quebec children in its emergency room with mild flu-like illnesses. That suggests many families are having trouble accessing care from family doctors and medical clinics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in anticipation of a potential surge in flu patients who develop life-threatening breathing problems, officials are in the process of finding ways to nearly double the number of intensive-care beds in the region, from 28 to about 52, said Morissette. That suggests other routine hospital services and elective surgeries could be scaled back.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ontario headed toward era of fiscal restraint: finance minister; $24.7B deficit prompts spending review, action plan to be unveiled in spring budget</b>
</div><div>Lee Greenberg   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>996 words</div><div>23 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Falling revenues and Ontario's staggeringly high, $24.7 billion, deficit will force the province's Liberal government into a new era of fiscal restraint, Finance Minister Dwight Duncan said Thursday.</p>
<p>But that new era does not start now.</p>
<p>According to economic figures released Thursday, Ontario is spending $4.8 billion more this year than it predicted just seven months ago. The increased spending includes $4 billion in auto sector assistance and an additional $650 million to fund the province's H1N1 response. Program spending has also risen by $812 million.</p>
<p>Tax revenues, meanwhile, are falling dramatically -- they now stand at $5.8 billion less than the government predicted in last spring's budget. Corporate taxes are $2.65 billion, or nearly one-third, lower than projections, while personal income tax is down $2.43 billion, or 10 per cent.</p>
<p>The province's diminished fiscal health will prompt a strategic spending review of all programs and services, Duncan said. The spending review will result in an action plan unveiled in the spring 2010 budget, likely to be tabled in March.</p>
<p>"We will change how we do business in this province," he told the legislature. "We are becoming an even leaner and even more efficient provider of quality public services."</p>
<p>Duncan refused to speculate about what -- if anything -- might change as a result of the spending review, including a public sector wage freeze, the possibility of asset sales of Crown corporations like the LCBO or cuts to smaller government programs.</p>
<p>"We haven't even begun to look at the choices we might make," he told reporters. "What we have said is when we're through this (program review) we'll have to look at restraint."</p>
<p>Conservatives, who have watched as the McGuinty Liberals raised spending by nearly 60 per cent over their first six years in office, were skeptical about the new pledge of austerity.</p>
<p>"Dalton McGuinty is hardwired to increase your taxes and increase spending," said Conservative leader Tim Hudak. "The reality is the only way to get spending under control is to change government."</p>
<p>Duncan said he wants any restraint program to make changes "without sacrificing important public services." He said the government would take a "sophisticated" approach to any cuts, adding spending will continue to rise in priority areas like health and education.</p>
<p>For example, the government's new full-day early learning program, expected to be unveiled as early as Tuesday, will remain untouched, he said. "This is not going to be a repeat of the late '90s," Duncan said, referring to the radical tax and spending cuts made by former premier Mike Harris.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, many will wonder how the government's diminished fiscal circumstances will impact on the massive new municipal transit plan. The province had committed $200 million to a smaller plan ultimately voted down by council and is now bracing for a much larger demand -- possibly more than triple the original amount -- in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Duncan would not say whether city officials would have to scale back their expectations.</p>
<p>"I can't address a specific project at this point in time," he said. "We'll look at (Ottawa's transit demands) in the context of everything else ... in the context of its ability to create jobs. We will look at it in its relative importance compared to, say, early childhood education, compared to, say, new hospitals."</p>
<p>One analyst said the province's massive deficit is heightened by the growing size of Ontario's health-care sector, expected to account for half the budget by 2015.</p>
<p>"It means everything else has to grow less or even has to be cut," said Pascal Gauthier, economist with TD Economics.</p>
<p>While Duncan is predicting modest growth this quarter, Gauthier says recovery should be well under way before the government begins cutting.</p>
<p>"The economy is still suffering pretty significantly from the recession," he said. "Government and central banks want confirmation the private sector has its legs under it and the recovery is sustainable. Budget time will be an appropriate time to get more specifics about the path back to balanced budgets."</p>
<p>Ontario's $24.7-billion budget deficit is a sharp increase from the $14.1 billion forecast in March. At that point the government claimed the province would be back to balanced budgets by 2015. They have subsequently dropped that claim.</p>
<p>Duncan, who was criticized Thursday for ushering in the largest deficit in Ontario's history, downplayed that fact.</p>
<p>He said the deficit is "generally consistent" with the size of Ontario's economy relative to the national economy.</p>
<p>"The governments of Canada, the United States and some other provinces have all recently adjusted their deficit projections upward for the coming year," he said in a prepared address to the assembly at Queen's Park.</p>
<p>Hudak said the province had the worst deficit-to-revenue ratio in Canada.</p>
<p>"This deficit is not the McGuinty government's problem," he told the legislature. "It is proof that the McGuinty government is the problem."</p>
<p>Ontario projects deficits of $21.1 billion in 2010-11 and $19.4 billion the following year. GDP is expected to decline 3.5 per cent this year, but be followed by modest gains of two per cent next year and three per cent in 2011.</p>
<p>The province has lost 205,200 jobs with employment in the auto sector down by 25.5 per cent over the first nine months in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.</p>

Minister Dwight Duncan listens to a question following the
announcement of the 2009 Economic Outlook and Fiscal Review at
Queen's Park in Toronto Thursday. Ontario's budget shortfall has
ballooned to $24.7 billion, billions higher than expected, and
'difficult choices' loom, Duncan says.

<div id="hd"><b>Why pregnant women need to be at the front of the vaccine line</b>
</div><div>JUDY GERSTEL    </div>
<div>SPECIAL TO THE STAR</div>
<div>356 words</div><div>23 October 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT05</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star    </div>
</p>
<p>Among the top concerns this week of Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Arlene King, is the preparedness of pregnant women for the pandemic H1N1 flu season that's getting underway.</p>
<p>"Pregnant women are in the first tier of those we believe need to be immunized as quickly as possible," says King.</p>
<p>That's because they're four to five times likely to develop complications from this flu, she explains.</p>
<p>Those most at risk are women in their second half of pregnancy - 20 weeks or more - and those with pre-existing health conditions.</p>
<p>Therefore, King is recommending that these women talk to their health care providers as soon as possible about getting the H1N1 vaccine, which will be available next week, even though this vaccine contains an adjuvant, an immune stimulating agent.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has recommended that pregnant women receive a vaccine without an adjuvant when possible, "because there is limited data about this vaccine with adjuvant in pregnant women."</p>
<p>But King points out that the adjuvanted vaccine has been licensed by Health Canada for everybody over the age of six months, including pregnant women. And she says, "In many parts of Canada, including in Ontario, there are rising rates of H1N1 illness and it's not clear when the non-adjuvanted vaccine will be available. We've been advised it'll be early November, but then it takes 10 to 14 days to mount an adequate immune response."</p>
<p>King says pregnant women in the first half of their pregnancy, with no pre-existing health conditions, may want to wait for this non-adjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>She recommends that those in the second half of pregnancy, and all pregnant women with pre-existing health conditions, get the first vaccine as soon as it's available, even though it has the adjuvant.</p>
<p>"It's a balance of risks and benefits," she says. "We're constantly evaluating emerging science and developing policies. And this is a pandemic. This situation is rolling out."</p>

</p>
<p>The best-case scenario, according to John King, co-chair of the Toronto teaching hospitals' Pandemic Task Force:</p>
<p>"It would be what we normally go through with seasonal flu. Some people get sick, some people die - there are always a certain number of deaths from seasonal flu (about 4,000 to 8,000 annually in Canada). We carry on through a bad winter season but we manage."</p>
<p>Even Better Best-Case Scenario</p>
<p>"Everyone gets a flu shot. H1N1 peters out, with minimal illness in the community and health-care workers remain healthy to care for the sick."</p>
<p>The Worst-Case Scenario</p>
<p>"About 30 per cent of hospital staff gets sick. H1N1 overwhelms clinics. It becomes a major community threat, putting a huge strain on critical-care capacity, requiring us to downsize some operations and to open up major assessment centres to relieve emergency departments."</p>
<p>The current Situation</p>
<p>"Right now, we're not seeing the numbers at all in Toronto. I think that we are all feeling fairly comfortable, compared to what we thought it would be two or three years ago. But it's still very early. The flu season doesn't really start 'til later. We know that it's yet to come. We're meeting, as a teaching hospital group and individually in hospitals on a regular basis, as if this was a bad flu season. We have not let our guard down."</p>
<p>The Outlook</p>
<p>"We're still not totally comfortable that it'll be a regular flu season. We're still planning as if this is going to be a tough flu season ... But at least we have a vaccine. Nobody really knows how the vaccinating is going to go but at least we have a vaccine. That's been a huge sigh of relief."</p>
<p>The Conclusion</p>
<p>"We're always doing disaster planning in a hospital. I never know when a crisis is going to happen."</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- Some bleary-eyed Toronto-area commuters are going to get taken for a ride today by Canada's Economic Action Plan express.</p>
<p>The Conservative government has spent more than $46,000 to turn two GO train cars into rolling advertisements along the Lakeshore line for its stimulus spending program, which has been widely criticized for putting image ahead of substance.</p>
<p>The opposition parties have been hammering away at the Conservatives for weeks about wasting money on self-promotion rather than spending scarce public dollars on informing the public about such pressing matters as the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"If there was ever a time to advertise on transit this was the time to do it on H1N1, not their economic plan. They missed the opportunity and this affects the health of Canadians," Liberal MP Kirsty Duncan (Etobicoke North) told the Star Thursday.</p>
<p>Duncan, a scientist who wrote a book about her 1998 expedition to uncover the cause of the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, told an earlier news conference the government is "fixated" on promoting itself. "Where is the billboard to tell Canadians how to protect their families against H1N1?"</p>
<p>Government records show at least $34 million has been spent on promoting its Economic Action Plan, which is the title of the Conservatives' January budget.</p>
<p>Liberal party estimates go as high as $60 million.</p>
<p>Faisal Rasheed, of Toronto's WestPalm Media, an advertising firm contracted to sell ads on the provincially owned <span class="companylink">GO Transit</span> system, said ordinarily the rate to wrap a train car is $75,000 for eight weeks.</p>
<p>Rasheed said the federal government prohibited him from revealing details of the contract, including how many train cars were involved.</p>
<p>Chris Day, spokesman for Transport and Infrastructure Minister John Baird, said the money is well spent, and the deal is for far less than the going rate.</p>
<p>"As part of our advertising campaign to inform Canadians about the Economic Action Plan, we paid $44,000 net (before taxes) to fully cover both sides of two cars on the Lakeshore line ... and as such our innovative ad campaign can be seen for 10 weeks along one of the busiest commuter routes in Canada," Day said. "We think this is good value for Canadian taxpayers."</p>

<p>When Justin Atkins took ill this week with a fever, aches and a cough, his parents took him to the family doctor.</p>
<p>And while his doctor did not make an H1N1 diagnosis, he chose caution and advised them to keep the 7-year-old home from school and away from his two siblings, fit him with a mask and fill a prescription for pediatric Tamiflu.</p>
<p>Trips to a half dozen pharmacies later, that prescription remained unfilled. As the virus begins to take hold in schools here, drug counters around the GTA are still awaiting shipments of the medication.</p>
<p>"I am so upset about it. How can the medication not be available?" said Susan Atkins, the child's mother.</p>
<p>"They had tonnes (of lead time) and for it to be on back order, wouldn't they be making more of whatever this medication is, especially for the kids," she said.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Mississauga's <span class="companylink">Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd</span>., which distributes Tamiflu in Canada, says there is an enormous supply of the 75 milligram adult capsules across the country, and that they can be readily converted by pharmacists into the sweet, liquid solution given to children.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Atkins family was able to obtain the drug from the Hospital for Sick Children, where pharmacists were doing just that.</p>
<p>Roche communications manager Laura Pagnotta says pharmacists are instructed in literature that accompanies the adult pills that ordinary chocolate syrup can do the trick when creating the children's dosage.</p>
<p>But David Jensen, a spokesperson for the provincial health ministry, which is coordinating Ontario's H1N1 response, said pharmacists here have been awaiting a supply of a product called Ora-Sweet to make the simple conversion.</p>
<p>Demand for that product to mix with Tamiflu has outstripped supply, he said, "but the manufacturer is ramping up" stock.</p>
<p>But "I have to admit that we don't have a definite timeline on how quickly they're going to be able to start meeting the demand, just that it's in the works" he said.</p>
<p>Calls to Minnesota's <span class="companylink">Paddock Laboratories, Inc</span>., one of the product's makers, were not returned Thursday. In the meantime, Jensen says the province will be importing more pediatric capsules - doses of 30 and 45 milligrams - for children age 1 and older.</p>
<p>"These will be supplied to pharmacies early next week," he said.</p>
<p>Jensen was surprised to learn that simple syrup was a manufacturers' approved alternative to the Ora-Sweet option.</p>
<p>The province has had months to build up its supply of Tamiflu as a fall H1N1 outbreak was predicted in the spring.</p>
<p>Ontario Pharmacists' Association chair Dean Miller said the new supply of children's capsules will ease any problems that exist, as will a memo from his organization, now being distributed to members, that suggests two available alternatives to Ora-Sweet.</p>
<p>But Miller said he's heard only a handful of concerns from pharmacists that they could not fill children's Tamiflu prescriptions, and they were simply creating pediatric doses on their own.</p>
<p>Pagnotta said the pediatric Tamiflu shortage is due to a decision last spring by the company's Swiss headquarters to concentrate on the adult version of the drug in anticipation of an autumn H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>Pagnotta said the adult capsules can be produced 25 times faster than the pediatric solution, which comes in a sugary liquid suspension.</p>
<p>"Also the capsules have a longer shelf life than the suspension and they're easier to store," she said.</p>
<p>The shortage of pediatric Tamiflu has existed in Canada and elsewhere for months, Pagnotta said. And while the company is feverishly manufacturing more of it, there is no telling when it will be available here.</p>
<p>But Pagnotta said the adult version can be easily tamped down into the liquid pediatric dosages and that it comes with instructions for pharmacists.</p>
<p>"And we have sent a letter of instruction out to all pharmacists across the country so that they can understand how to repurpose that product into a pediatric dose."</p>

<p>Two rural school divisions have three schools with higher-than-normal absentee rates for the second week in a row -- but not the same schools as last week.</p>
<p>Lakeshore School Division reported Thursday that there is higher-than-usual absenteeism at Ashern Central School and Fisher Branch Early Years School.</p>
<p>And Turtle River School Division reported "abnormally high" absenteeism at Parkview School, a Hutterite colony school near Riding Mountain.</p>
<p>Neither division will comment on the absences, and Manitoba Health has said repeatedly that it will not identify the presence of H1N1 in any community unless there is a compelling public health reason to do so.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Immunization set, but pace yourselves -</b>
</div><div>By Larry Kusch    </div>

</p>
<p>Winnipeg's massive H1N1 immunization campaign begins Monday morning at a dozen locations, but health officials are pleading with people not to 'come on down' all at once.</p>
<p>"We don't need everyone who we're recommending to get vaccinated first to come on the first day," said Dr. Sande Harlos, a medical officer of health with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority.</p>
<p>If you're in one of the priority categories for receiving the H1N1 vaccine (see list below), go to a clinic when it's convenient for you, Harlos said.</p>
<p>"We invite people to take this seriously and get vaccinated as soon as they can -- but really space themselves out over the next week or two to make sure our clinics will flow smoothly and it's not inconvenient for people to wait too long," she told reporters Thursday.</p>
<p>Local health officials are holding mass-immunization clinics at cultural centres, parish halls and several shopping centres over the next six weeks. The clinics will be open from 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mondays-Thursdays and 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Fridays.</p>
<p>Officials expect to administer 60,000 to 75,000 doses of vaccine per week, first to the groups most vulnerable to the H1N1 virus and then to everyone else who wants a shot.</p>
<p>While they're planning on 75 per cent of Winnipeggers rolling up their sleeves for the free vaccine, they're hoping for even higher numbers.</p>
<p>Getting immunized can protect you from the flu but also protects others from getting it, too, Harlos said. "If I'm immune and I get exposed, I don't get ill and then I don't pass it on to someone else," she said.</p>
<p>For the first couple of weeks, only those on the priority list will be immunized, and then the WRHA will open the mass clinics to anybody who wants a shot. The authority will issue a bulletin advising when the clinics will be open to all.</p>
<p>But at first, the following have priority: children aged six months to under five years old; everyone of aboriginal ancestry (First Nations, Métis or Inuit); people under 65 with chronic illness or other risk conditions, including severe obesity, substance abuse or alcoholism; anyone with a weakened immune system or those who live with and care for them; single parents or anyone solely responsible for a dependent; people living in remote or isolated areas; and disadvantaged populations, such as the homeless.</p>
<p>Health-care workers and medical first responders will be offered vaccine at their workplaces, but can also attend the mass clinics if it is more convenient for them.</p>
<p>The WRHA is advising pregnant women to wait until early next month for an unadjuvanted vaccine. But if H1N1 rates are high or increasing before it becomes available, women more than 20 weeks pregnant can be offered adjuvanted vaccine, the health authority said.</p>
<p>The WRHA said Thursday that the clinics are not booking appointments. Patients will be seen on a first-come, first-served basis. Bring your Manitoba Health card.</p>
<p>Officials said that school-aged children will be immunized at the mass clinics along with their parents -- as opposed to in the school.</p>
<p>Special smaller clinics will be set up, however, at soup kitchens, homeless shelters and other locations to reach vulnerable or disadvantaged persons who may find it difficult to show up at one of the mass clinics.</p>
<p>Gloria O'Rourke, vice-president of human resources with the WRHA, said the H1N1 immunization is a massive undertaking, with 1,000 staff shifts per week needing to be filled across the city.</p>
<p>She said the WRHA is calling on nurses and nurse practitioners who can work extra shifts to help out at the clinics, as well as nurses who work in doctor's offices and recently retired nurses.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Cangene doubles profits, hits record sales during downturn -</b>
</div><div>By Martin Cash    </div>
<div>695 words</div><div>23 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>WINNIPEG-BASED Cangene doubled its profits and generated record sales in the worst economy in memory and says it believes there is still plenty of growth left in its lucrative bio-defence work.</p>
<p>Much of the sales and profit growth for the year ending July 31 came from bio-defence products it sells to the U.S. government -- specifically botulism antitoxin and anthrax immune globulin.</p>
<p>The company's revenue increased by 44 per cent to $238.8 million and profits doubled to $60 million for the year.</p>
<p>Investors jumped enthusiastically on the Cangene bandwagon Thursday, sending the stock up more than 40 per cent to $6.39 in one of its heaviest trading periods in months.</p>
<p>So far, it has only shipped about one-third of the $500-million-plus bio-defence order it has with the U.S. strategic national stockpile, with the remainder expected to be delivered over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>But John Langstaff, Cangene's CEO, said that will not necessarily be the end of the revenue potential for those products.</p>
<p>"The message we are trying to get out there is that we don't think we need to worry about life after bio-defence," he said. "We view bio-defence as similar to <span class="companylink">Lockheed-Martin</span>'s relationship with U.S. military in aerospace -- it is a long-term business endeavour."</p>
<p>Douglas Loe, an analyst with Versant Partners in Toronto, has a $10 target on the stock, even though he says it is "a jump ball" as to whether or not the company will be able to extend the current U.S. bio-defence contracts past 2011, when most of the existing orders are to be delivered.</p>
<p>"There is lots of arm-waving and vague allusions," Loe said, referring to the company's expectations the contracts will be extended.</p>
<p>But Langstaff said there is plenty of reason to believe that will be the case. He said not only does Cangene have the capacity to deliver even more than the current order, it had to demonstrate it had that capacity in the first place.</p>
<p>In addition to the botulism and anthrax products and vaccinia immune globulin, which counteracts negative reactions to the smallpox vaccine, the company is negotiating its largest research and development contract ever for the development of a therapeutic to treat acute radiation syndrome.</p>
<p>When negotiations are complete, it will be a five-year project Langstaff said could also result in licensing of a compound and potential future sales.</p>
<p>In addition to its record-breaking top and bottom lines, the company sports a balance sheet free of debt.</p>
<p>It is in the process of undertaking preliminary regulatory filings that might eventually lead to a stock listing on a U.S. exchange.</p>
<p>"We could probably borrow funds from our banks, but if we wanted to do a significant acquisition we might want to raise money on the public market," Langstaff said.</p>
<p>The company bought a small Vancouver firm called Twinstrand Therapeutics in July and earlier this month paid $7 million up front for the U.S. commercial rights for HepaGam B, used in the treatment of hepatitis B.</p>
<p>Cangene had done most of the research and development work for that compound for <span class="companylink">Apotex Inc</span>. Cangene will also pay royalties until 2016 to the Mississauga pharmaceutical company, which owns about 50 per cent of Cangene's shares.</p>
<p>Cangene develops most of its compounds using purified human plasma, sometimes extracting antibodies that can be used as therapeutic treatments.</p>
<p>It is doing work in that regard focused on the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Langstaff said the company is seeking funding support to continue that work, but he does not believe it will be available for the current round of immunization work.</p>

<p>DRUMROLL, please. We have rolled out the H1N1 vaccine. It's in the warehouses – hold on, I'm being told it's now been approved by our tests, though our tests aren't complete and most of them aren't ours and we already knew most of what we now know before this. Never mind. You can get the vaccine, but not yet. And maybe not when you go for it since there's not enough for everyone so we're asking people who aren't at risk not to get it though if they go they can get it. Except in some places. Anyway, it's a Go! …</p>
<p>In fact, it was CBC news who trumpeted, “It's a go!” They joined the general rollicking mood. Personally I'd like to know where to go to be inoculated against the confusion and lack of clarity surrounding this story.</p>
<p>How did it start? Last April, Dr. Margaret Chan, of the World Health Organization, said a pandemic was “imminent” and “the whole of humanity“ was “under threat” from it. And you thought humanity was under threat from stuff like nuclear arsenals and global warming. But she may have felt she had to match some of the hysterical overstatement already abroad.</p>
<p>Then this summer, the bottom appeared to fall out of the panic. Under advice apparently from WHO and others, Canada decided to delay production of the H1N1 vaccine in favour of seasonal flu vaccine. This at least is how it seems to Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief medical officer. But this fall, he says, reports of H1N1 rose again, as was predictable, since new flus normally replace old ones. The geniuses in charge abruptly tried to speed up the vaccine they'd held back, with limited, confusing results. Dr. Schabas says he has no idea why they didn't make the switch in summer. I, however, will risk a guess. Realizing they had overdone it in the spring, they underdid it to compensate in the summer, then reverted to panic in the fall. This is consistent with their consistent record of inconsistency.</p>
<p>So, for instance, pregnant women are at special risk and should take a particular version of the vaccine, which Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said would be ready but others say will be two weeks later than the stuff now shipping. Why did they delay that critical batch? We don't know. Some experts say get a shot now; others say wait. A TV reporter summarized the chaos: “It'll be up to pregnant women to choose which one they'll get.” That isn't inconsistent, it's brutal. It's like your doctor telling you to choose between a triple and a quintuple bypass.</p>
<p>Why not just go ahead and die?</p>
<p>It's all presided over by many of the clowns who performed during the 2003 SARS crisis. There's Dr. Donald Low, who looks like one of the actors who used to play doctors on headache ads, with a “simulation” caption underneath. He and others ran off to explain to international meetings what heroes they were just as the second round of SARS hit. Or Dr. Allison McGeer, who always has the look of a character in a disaster movie. Dr. David Butler-Jones has joined the troupe. He's from Manitoba, where native reserves were denied hand sanitizers, since they contain alcohol, and body bags were sent instead. The show must go on.</p>
<p>The actual disease looks like it will be mild if widespread. But the clowns – pardon, experts – seem to have had a booster shot of PR that causes them to try to sound clear and decisive even if they're totally at sea. This in turn makes the rest of us feel crazy, since we assume it means something. (e.g., Dr. Low: “We're seeing disease now. And we're seeing increasing disease in British Columbia and we're seeing it in Ontario right now.”)</p>
<p>It would be a relief if they shut up occasionally, if only to convey the impression that they're thinking. Instead they all act, as Groucho said to Mrs. Teasdale, as if they've been vaccinated with a phonograph needle.</p>

<p>Having a winning personality will open more doors in a job search than a brilliant résumé, a new study has found.</p>
<p>When presented with accounting or finance candidates with similar qualifications, 34 per cent of 270 Canadian chief financial officers interviewed said applicants' people skills would tip the balance over such attributes as industry experience and software proficiency.</p>
<p>This is up significantly from five years ago, when interpersonal skills were cited as a decisive factor by only 1 per cent of respondents. In 2004, 55 per cent cited industry experience as the decisive factor, compared to just 28 per cent this year.</p>
<p>The results suggest that office cultures have become much more interactive and collaborative in an economically stressed economy, said Kathryn Bolt, president of staffing service Accountemps, which commissioned the survey.</p>
<p>Describing past experiences that required strong teamwork, leadership and communication skills will give candidates a leg up on the competition, she suggests. “Practising responses to interview questions will help candidates relax and make a good impression with the employer.”</p>
<p>H1N1 flu won't stop</p>
<p>many Quebec workers</p>
<p>Many employees in Quebec say they plan to show up for work even if they have the H1N1 flu virus, according to a survey by Quebec's human resources association.</p>
<p>The survey found 24 per cent of 1,000 workers surveyed said they would still go to work if they or a household member had the flu. And 59 per cent said they routinely go to work when ill for any reason.</p>
<p>However, 44 per cent of respondents said they would be afraid to go to work if a co-workers had the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>And despite all the publicity about the threat and prevention, 45 per cent said their employers hadn't introduced any preventive measures, while 53 per cent said they hadn't changed personal habits, such as washing hands more often or using hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>Cost cutting bites into</p>
<p>planned bonuses, raises</p>
<p>Corporate cost cutting has led 55 per cent of U.S. companies to reduce planned bonuses this year and 42 per cent have scaled back raises, according to a survey of financial officers at 836 companies by accounting firm <span class="companylink">Grant Thornton LLP</span>. Although the numbers are high, they are more optimistic than a similar survey the company did in the spring, when 65 per cent of respondents said they weren't planning to give raises, and 47 per cent didn't expect to hand out bonuses.</p>

<p>Concerns about the H1N1 flu virus are bolstering the bottom lines of several companies as demand rises for products such as masks, soap and vaccines. Here's a look at some companies and products that are benefiting:</p>
<p>• <span class="companylink">Kimberly-Clark</span>: The maker of Kleenex and Huggies diapers said about 40 per cent of its gain in health-care volumes in the last quarter “was attributable to increased global demand for face masks as a result of the H1N1 flu virus.” That gain helped boost its third-quarter profit by 41 per cent.</p>
<p>• 3M: The U.S. manufacturer said demand is rising for its respiratory masks. It estimates demand related to swine flu fears added between $80-million and $100-million (U.S.) to third-quarter sales.</p>
<p>• Merck: The drug maker said demand is growing for its vaccine, Pneumovax, which protects against strains of disease that can cause pneumonia, a common flu complication. Sales are up about 80 per cent from a year ago. Rivals Novartis AG and <span class="companylink">Roche Holding AG</span>, which make flu vaccinations, are also seeing higher sales.</p>
<p>• <span class="companylink">Clorox Co</span>.: At the U.S. home and laundry business, Clorox bleach and wipes account for about 30 per cent of sales. It reports earnings on Nov. 2.</p>
<p>• Purell: Ohio-based <span class="companylink">Gojo Industries</span> invented Purell, the top-selling hand sanitizer. The private company still makes Purell, and <span class="companylink">Johnson & Johnson</span> distributes it. This summer, overall hand sanitizer sales jumped 19 per cent from a year earlier, according to Chicago-based <span class="companylink">Information Resources Inc</span>.</p>
<p>• <span class="companylink">Ecolab Inc</span>.: Hand sanitizer maker <span class="companylink">Ecolab</span> has “seen a significant increase in orders” for the gel in the third quarter and expects the trend to remain strong through the flu season, spokesman Michael Monahan said this month.</p>

</p>
<p>The City of Toronto is issuing thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer to its civil servants, just as residents brace for disruptions at several community centres during an intensive, six-week vaccination program for the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Participants in activities at the Masaryk-Cowan centre in Parkdale, for example, say they were told the gymnasium will be shut down when vaccination clinics open on Nov. 2. The clinics will be launched at 10 locations throughout the city, including several civic and community centres (see list below).</p>
<p>Public health officials were unclear on the extent of the service disruption yesterday, but spokeswoman Rishma Govani confirmed community centres would be affected.</p>
<p>"They can expect some kind of interruption," she said, but the clinics are "a critical service that we have to put out there to the public."</p>
<p>Spokewoman Susan Sperling said the goal was to minimize disruption and hopefully relocate certain activities that may be affected.</p>
<p>In addition to Masaryk-Cowan, North Kipling and North Toronto Memorial community centres will host clinics. Others are being set up at the East York, North York, Etobicoke and Scarborough civic centres, along with Metro Hall. Two closed schools are also being utilized.</p>
<p>Councillor Karen Stintz (Eglinton Lawrence) said the city should be able to operate H1N1 clinics without disruping recreational services.</p>
<p>"To give the seasonal flu shot is something we're quite familiar with because we do it at City Hall, and it's not run for six weeks, and it hasn't interrupted recreational programs," Ms. Stintz said. "So we have the experience of operating these clinics without the kind of disruption they're proposing now.... I don't understand why we can't replicate what we already know works."</p>
<p>The flu-shot plan could have been approached in other ways, she suggested, perhaps by partnering with local libraries. Ms. Stintz said she was surprised council was not informed about the pending disruptions.</p>
<p>"Had this been the plan all along, I would have expected more dialogue with councillors about this impact," she said. Ms. Stintz was also critical of the city's plan to provide all members of the public service with individual bottles of hand sanitizer, an initiative that would include thousands of employees. She called the plan "outrageous."</p>
<p>"I would expect that employees could buy their own hand sanitizer."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu, TB and the attention of the media</b>
</div><div>Alan Cassels   </div>
<div>Special to Times Colonist</div>
<div>744 words</div><div>23 October 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>Given that we're drowning in media attention to the swine flu, it's hard to get a sense of proportion about it. The H1N1 flu is still a great unknown, so precautions and preparations provide lots of fodder for news outlets.</p>
<p>When Margaret Chan, the World Health Organization director-general, declared the 2009 swine flu a pandemic and a "public health emergency of international concern," she ignited a worldwide firestorm of discussion about a new global killer.</p>
<p>But how big is this swine flu thing compared to other highly infectious pandemic diseases -- tuberculosis, for example?</p>
<p>One Swedish researcher recently examined the numbers of deaths versus media pieces related to swine flu and TB.</p>
<p>In a two-week period, from April 24 to May 6, there were 31 deaths related to swine flu (29 in Mexico and two in the U.S.). In that same period, there were 63,066 deaths from tuberculosis, mostly in the poorer parts of the world.</p>
<p>That two-week period, according to a <span class="companylink">Google</span> News search, generated 250,000 media stories related to the swine flu compared to 6,500 for TB, making the news-per-death ratio for swine flu 8,176 news reports per death, versus TB's 0.1 story per death.</p>
<p>In other words, every person who died due to swine flu equalled about 8,000 news stories around the world, yet it took nearly 10 TB deaths to generate even one news story.</p>
<p>What is wrong with this picture?</p>
<p>What characterizes the news coverage of H1N1 flu, more than any other feature, is its volume. It is on the front pages, the airwaves, the TV, the Internet, everywhere, which adds to the hysteria and sense of panic over a disease that, comparatively speaking, doesn't seem to be particularly lethal.</p>
<p>TB, on the other hand, is perhaps not a "pandemic," but is found on almost every continent and we even get it in B.C. as it occasionally rears its head in places of poverty.</p>
<p>And while the majority of people infected with the H1N1 virus make a full recovery and don't need medical attention or antiviral drugs, the same can't be said for TB.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis spreads easily through the air and many of us carry latent infections. Some of those with latent TB will eventually become active disease carriers and, if left untreated, it can kill more than half of them. TB is treatable with antibiotics.</p>
<p>According to the WHO, new TB infections occur at a rate of one per second.</p>
<p>Despite this, the disease which infects nearly nine million new people per year barely manages to pierce the front pages of our papers.</p>
<p>Is it because we don't care? Because we don't fear deaths that happen in far-away, forgotten corners of the world?</p>
<p>Perhaps it's because what happens in our own backyard is much more newsworthy than what happens overseas.</p>
<p>Fortunately, out of the headlights of daily media attention, a handful of international development groups have kept their attention on the big killers like TB, AIDS and malaria.</p>
<p>RESULTS Canada is one such citizen advocacy group which has a long record of generating funding where it will save the most lives. Recently, RESULTS and other non-government organizations increased Canada's contribution to "TB Reach" -- a new global initiative announced in March that will help ensure more of the world's poorest have access to TB treatment.</p>
<p>With $127 million in new money to fight TB, many thousands of lives will be saved in countries where the need is greatest.</p>
<p>While this might be a drop in the bucket compared to the billions around the world currently being spent on swine flu preparations, vaccines and drugs, at least there is one heartwarming aspect.</p>
<p>Saving lives of people with easily treatable diseases is important. And we must act, to do something against the world's biggest killers, even if it is out of the reaches of the media's spotlight.</p>
<p>Alan Cassels is a health researcher and volunteer with RESULTS Canada.</p>
<p>On Sunday, RESULTS is hosting a fundraiser featuring Betty Makoni, founder of the Girl Child Network in Zimbabwe, one of CNN's Top 10 Heroes of 2009, at the Hotel Grand Pacific from 2 to 4 p.m. Admission by donation. For more information, e-mail anitamark@shaw.ca.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The cyber crime epidemic; Terrorists and rogue states are moving their battle to the Internet. How do we fight it?</b>
</div><div>Rodney Joffe   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>989 words</div><div>23 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A23</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>This October is "Cyber Security Awareness Month." Along with most other Canadians, you've likely let it pass you by. But you shouldn't.</p>
<p>Like the global epidemics of the AIDS and H1N1 flu viruses, the issue of cyber crime is now every-one's problem. It affects the lives of all of us. It affects entire companies when financial thefts occur. It affects the country when national secrets are stolen. And it affects you when your financial institution is breached -- you'll experience higher fees, even when your specific account is untouched.</p>
<p>Last June, the residents of Bullitt County school district in Kentucky lost US$415,000 overnight from a single cyber theft. The gang that took the money is responsible for four to five of these thefts a day, at an average loss of $100,000 each. And they've been pulling this same stunt for the past nine months -- every single day.</p>
<p>Instead of taking action to fix the problem, we sit back and blame the manufacturers of operating systems, the anti-virus companies and the governments of the countries involved. Meanwhile, the cyber criminals are industriously launching widespread malicious software attacks, stealing our information and account credentials, and ultimately stealing our money. On a global scale, the cost is staggering; while detailed data are difficult to collate, Interpol and FIRST, a global organization of security researchers and law enforcement officers, issued a joint press release in June estimating the losses from phishing, one of the most common forms of cyber crime, at US$2-trillion worldwide.</p>
<p>We have to do something.</p>
<p>Trying to stop widespread e-crime using the "whack-a-mole" approach is counterproductive, and misses the point; tactical intervention may thwart or reduce the effects of individual strains of malicious software, but it won't help with the fundamental cyber crime challenges we all face. Collaboration between government and private industry worldwide must improve to contend with the cyber security issues that threaten society on a number of fronts. We need to understand that the spoils of these crimes are being used not only to fund traditional criminal enterprises, but increasingly to support terrorist groups.</p>
<p>Here's a three-pronged approach that would help:</p>
<p>Firstly, we need to acknowledge that cyber crime is truly an epidemic. That means the public has to be better educated about what is happening. Computer users must stop ignoring the threat, assuming that their machines are protected simply because they have up-to-date computer and anti-virus software, and they never click on strange links or open odd emails. Modern malicious software needs nothing more than for your computer to be on to infect you, and the most modern attacks infect through trusted websites.</p>
<p>Secondly, we need to do everything we can to encourage co-operation between government and private industry. That includes telecommunications carriers, cable companies and especially researchers. We must also encourage the major Internet service providers to take responsibility for helping their customers recognize that they have been compromised, and as in real epidemics, to isolate those customers from the rest of us so that the "infection" doesn't spread. This is not new or radical; some providers have been using these "walled gardens" for some time, despite the public outcry and backlash. It should be the standard. And we should provide government funding for these efforts.</p>
<p>We must help establish collaborative infrastructure and two-way conduits for information to flow more rapidly and securely between all stakeholders in this fight. In an informal survey conducted in the wake of the global Conficker worm attack earlier this spring, the Conficker Working Group identified more than 75 different multinational groups worldwide attempting to combat various aspects of cyber crime. Some are led by governments, some by private industry and some by academics. This results in enormous wasted effort and duplication. It is important to improve co-operation and create a comprehensive plan to reexamine the way we interact, and how the systems we build interact, in order to attack the problem. And we must establish trust between all of these parties. The government tradition of taking information in and not sharing it outwardly is passe. These days far more situational awareness exists in the private sector, a reality borne out by reaction to the recent Conficker worm -- government was the last to recognize the threat.</p>
<p>Finally, we must recognize that our laws are woefully inadequate and out of date. They don't begin to recognize the global nature of cyber crime. We have to understand how the criminals "game" our system, and make carefully considered changes. We need to bring international pressure to bear on governments that support or protect these criminals, and we have to make sure we don't make errors in legislation that end up hindering us from dealing with the problem. A prime example of a rule that must be reconsidered by Parliament is the law that was enacted to criminalize the placement and execution of computer programs on a computer without the owner's permission. While this law was designed to stop cyber criminals from doing what they now do with impunity, it has actually blocked computer scientists and government from releasing countermeasures -- the equivalent of vaccines -- to disable the malicious software.</p>
<p>Cyber crime doesn't affect a virtual world. It affects and threatens the real world. Our world. And the responsibility for with dealing with it rests with every single one of us. - "Fighting the Virtual War" is presented in collaboration with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), a Washington, D.C.-based policy institute focused on terrorism. Rodney Joffe is senior technologist of <span class="companylink">NeuStar, Inc</span>. and director of the Conficker Working Group.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ontario deficit to hit $24.7B; Province follows trend</b>
</div><div>Chris Thompson   </div>
<div>The Windsor Star</div>
<div>703 words</div><div>23 October 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>As bad as the news of a nearly $25-billion deficit finance minister Dwight Duncan had to deliver at Queen's Park on Thursday was, he can take solace in the fact his cohorts across North America are bearers of similar bad news, a political scientist says.</p>
<p>"One thing they've got going for them is they're in good company," said University of Windsor political science professor Cheryl Collier.</p>
<p>"They've got a little bit of a buffer. Every province is in the red, the U.S. is in the red. They can probably play with that and the goodwill people have."</p>
<p>Duncan announced an increase of almost $5 billion in spending -- due to the auto industry bailouts and swine flu preparation -- while also detailing a precipitous drop-off in tax revenues.</p>
<p>Collier said the public's goodwill will only last so long and the Liberals will have to come up with a plausible deficit exit strategy ahead of the next provincial election in October 2011.</p>
<p>"What will be interesting is how well they can get a handle on their spending," said Collier.</p>
<p>"As a Liberal government they are not going to want to cut too much out. It will be very interesting to see where they go from here."</p>
<p>Duncan did allude to having to make "tough choices" as time goes by.</p>
<p>Collier said one choice they aren't likely to make is to borrow from the Bob Rae NDP government playbook and institute "Rae Days" or in this case "Dalton Days," forced unpaid days off the NDP invoked in 1993 as part of the Social Contract.</p>
<p>"He (McGuinty) would hate to have that moniker stuck on anything he does," said Collier.</p>
<p>"Whether or not they do something along those lines remains to be seen, but I don't think the Liberals will want to do anything the NDP tried back then."</p>
<p>Collier said the Liberals came to power thanks in large part to so-called strategic voting by provincial public servants, so they may be reluctant to anger them.</p>
<p>"We'll be forgiving for a time, I think, but the government will have to make some tough decisions," said Collier.</p>
<p>Don Ford, spokesman for the Ontario Public Service Employees' Union, said speculation about Dalton Days is just that.</p>
<p>"You don't recover an economy by taking money out of people's pockets," said Ford.</p>
<p>"The government has signed contracts with all the unions. This government has a track record of respecting the collective bargaining process. We don't feel that would be a wise move by the government. If the government was thinking about this we would hope at some point they would be in touch with us."</p>
<p>Windsor CUPE Local 543 president Jean Fox, who endured Rae Days in the 1990s, said public sector workers have shared enough pain.</p>
<p>"Why is it always government and municipal staff that have to bear the brunt of deficits?" said Fox.</p>
<p>"Somewhere down the line it's forgotten by the general public that we're forced to make sacrifices."</p>
<p>COST CUTS</p>
<p>The province's diminished fiscal health will prompt a strategic spending review of all programs and services, Duncan said. The spending review will result in an action plan unveiled in the spring 2010 budget, likely to be tabled in March.</p>
<p>"We will change how we do business in this province," he told the legislature. "We are becoming an even leaner and even more efficient provider of quality public services."</p>
<p>Duncan refused to speculate about what -- if anything -- might change as a result of the spending review, including a public sector-wage freeze, the possibility of asset sales of Crown corporations like the LCBO or cuts to smaller government programs.</p>

Outlook and Fiscal Review in the Legislature at Queen's Park in
Toronto on Thursday. Ontario's budget shortfall has ballooned to

</div><div>Compiled Caroline Alphonso  </div>

</p>
<p>Toronto --</p>
<p>Readers: Please note this story was published October 22.</p>
<p>With Health Canada's stamp of approval on the H1N1 vaccine, provinces and territories have started releasing their vaccination clinic plans for what is going to be the country's largest immunization campaign. Please check your local health authority for more specific details on times and locations.</p>
<p>New Brunswick</p>
<p>Public health officials expect to start administering the swine flu vaccine today to the vaccinators and staff responsible for rolling out the program. Priority groups, which include First Nation communities, school-age children and health-care workers, will be able to access it starting Monday. The province currently has 83,000 doses, and more are expected to come in over the next month. The vaccine will be offered to all in the province in the weeks to come.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia</p>
<p>There are 1.4 million doses of the vaccine on order and needles start going into arms next week, with the priority on high-risk groups such as people under the age of 65 with chronic conditions, health-care workers and children six months to less than five years of age. Pregnant women are also a high-priority group across Canada, but many doctors recommend they wait a few more weeks for a version of the vaccine that has no adjuvants. Adjuvants are compounds to boost the immune system's response.</p>
<p>Prince Edward Island</p>
<p>Doses of the H1N1 vaccine will be available starting next week. Aboriginals, health-care workers, people with chronic conditions under 65 and children six months old up to the age of school entry are among those considered a priority. Mass public clinics are scheduled to begin Nov. 16.</p>
<p>Newfoundland and Labrador</p>
<p>Mass immunization clinics will start offering the vaccine Monday to health care workers before moving on to other priority groups Nov. 2. At the front of the line should be anyone under 65 with chronic health issues, pregnant women, and children aged six months to five years old.</p>
<p>Ontario</p>
<p>The province already has 722,000 doses of vaccine, which will be offered starting Monday to certain groups that are more vulnerable to contracting swine flu: adults under the age of 65 with chronic conditions, health-care workers, caregivers for high-risk groups, people living in remote and isolated communities, pregnant women and healthy children six months to five years of age.</p>
<p>Manitoba</p>
<p>The government says that as of Monday, clinics will be set up in targeted areas offering free vaccinations to those first on the priority list: preschoolers, aboriginals, people with chronic medical conditions, health-care workers, pregnant women and others who are deemed most vulnerable. Manitoba expects to have 134,000 vaccine doses the week of Oct. 26, and subsequent deliveries of vaccine will continue weekly. The province will also fly in teams of health professionals to remote northern reserves that were hit hard by the flu's first wave last spring. Dozens of people from the Island Lake region were hospitalized, even though the area has just 10,000 residents.</p>
<p>Quebec</p>
<p>In the province where an elderly woman was the first casualty of the so-called second wave, vaccination is set to get under way on Monday. Quebec is spending $115-million to administer a total of 11.5 million doses, and distribution has already begun.</p>
<p>Alberta</p>
<p>Expects to have 400,000 doses on hand by Monday, and it will begin its inoculation program then, health officials said. The province is urging those in the high-risk groups to seek the shot as soon as possible, but won't be screening recipients. “We will vaccinate whoever shows up. But we are encouraging people who are the highest risk to come forward first,” Dr. Gerry Predy, Alberta's senior medical officer of health, said in a news conference Wednesday.</p>
<p>British Columbia</p>
<p>Gets its clinics under way next week for women more than 20 weeks pregnant, people under 65 who have chronic health conditions, and people in remote and rural communities. The province currently has 230,000 doses of vaccine on hand. The program will expand to children and infants and health-care providers in the second week, while everyone else can get in line the following week.</p>
<p>Northwest Territories</p>
<p>Begins offering the vaccine to everyone on Monday. The territory has more than 30,000 doses, and it expects to receive more. Health officials have also set up four action teams, consisting of 18 nurses and seven logisticians, who will help communities vaccinate their populations.</p>
<p>Nunavut</p>
<p>Orientation started Wednesday and the territory will start immunizing its population on Nov. 1. Through mass community clinics, everyone will be offered the vaccine at the same time. The territory has enough vaccine ordered for 75 per cent of its population.</p>

</div><div>Greg Harder </div>
<div>Leader-Post</div>
<div>662 words</div><div>22 October 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>C5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post </div>
</p>
<p>The Notre Dame Hounds have discovered their own remedy for the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>It was procured Wednesday night on Taylor Field when the Hounds captured the Regina High Schools Athletic Association 2A girls soccer title with a 2-1 win over the Miller Marauders.</p>
<p>It was the first city championship for the Notre Dame senior girls soccer team. More importantly, it came in the wake of what has been a tough few days at Athol Murray College of Notre Dame, where all sporting events were temporarily suspended due to an H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>The five-day hiatus resulted in the city final being rescheduled from Monday to Wednesday.</p>
<p>"I think (the win) will have an effect on school spirit for sure," offered Hounds captain Meagan Vestby. "We're the first game since the school started back into sports. It's kind of like, 'We can get through this,' kind of an inspirational thing. At least that's what I hope our team can instill for the rest of the school. It's kind of a little light of hope."</p>
<p>The Hounds overcame difficult odds to win Wednesday's game, since six of their regular players -- including four starters -- didn't make the trip due to illness. As a precautionary measure, anyone at Notre Dame who displays any flu-like symptoms is quarantined.</p>
<p>As of last weekend, there had been five confirmed cases of H1N1 within the student body at the Wilcox-based school. In total, 14 of Notre Dame's 320 students were being treated by medical personnel, mostly due to flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"Our school has been very proactive," said Hounds head coach Ramona Vigneron. "It's like keeping your child at home to make sure they're better. (The kids) have gone to bed earlier and we've kicked this. That's what you're supposed to do when you're down and sick. Some of the girls who aren't here today just had flu-like symptoms so we're keeping you (home) until you're clear."</p>
<p>Despite being short-handed, Notre Dame pulled out the victory thanks to a late goal by Olivia Mason, an import from England. Courtenay Jacklin had the other goal for the Hounds. Miller's Megan Feruglio was the only player to beat fill-in goaltender Mick Plenel, who had never played the position.</p>
<p>"This is an awesome thing for our school as a whole," said Vigneron. "I'm very proud of all our athletes at our school. The girls we brought in today were healthy and ready to play. They tried hard. It was a very, very close game. It was definitely a team effort.</p>
<p>"Our girls are very in-shape athletes. They only had a couple subs today. They played the full 90 minutes and they played very strong. I was very proud of how well the girls played. Both teams showed a lot of class. It was a clean, strong, hard game."</p>
<p>Despite the loss, Miller advances to next week's provincial championships in Regina. Notre Dame needs to win a regional tournament this weekend in Humboldt to advance to the Saskatchewan finals.</p>
<p>"We played Miller last year in the finals and ended up losing in penalty kicks," added Vestby. "That makes things a lot more emotional this year. With the flu stuff, we were always taught at Notre Dame to never quit. Hounds never quit. We just kept our focus and didn't really let it get to us."</p>
<p>NOTE: The RHSAA large schools bronze-medal games are slated for Saturday at the Usher Collegiate field. The girls' game is at 11 a.m. and the boys' game is at 1 p.m. There's a $2 admission charge, with all proceeds going to breast cancer research.</p>

<p>Athol Murray College of Notre Dame lifted its self-imposed quarantine Wednesday, enabling high school students to once again participate in high school athletic competitions.</p>
<p>Officials at the private residential school in Wilcox decided to postpone or cancel sporting events on Friday in consultation with the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region and the school's health nurses in an attempt to contain an outbreak of H1N1 at the school.</p>
<p>"We still have some kids with flu-like symptoms, but we have no new H1N1 confirmations other than the seven that are already reported," Notre Dame president Rob Palmarin said.</p>
<p>"So our athletic teams, one of them -- our girls' soccer team -- is resuming competition (Wednesday) and is participating in the city final. Tomorrow, we have a couple of hockey teams, girls' volleyball team and our football team back in action. Probably, by the weekend, all of the teams will have resumed play.</p>
<p>"But we are still being cautious and treating cases individually now."</p>
<p>Palmarin said individual students who are ill with flu-like symptoms will be isolated in the school's health-care wing for a five- to a seven-day period.</p>
<p>"So here is the important thing: when we send out a team (to a sporting event), we are sending out healthy athletes. So we are improving, and are resuming our (athletic) competitions,'' he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Moira McKinnon, Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer, said there is no need to cancel classes or sporting events as long as children with flu symptoms are isolated until they are well enough to participate and schools use proper infection control such as handwashing.</p>
<p>Whether classes or sports events are cancelled often relates to capacity once absenteeism starts to rise, she said, noting that cancellation might occur if 20 per cent of a sports team are missing.</p>
<p>Asked if students are more at risk of getting H1N1 at a sports activity than at other places, McKinnon replied that, "we are all at risk of getting H1N1.</p>
<p>"Money changes several hands throughout the day. Sporting functions are often where the virus does transmit, but there are many other places, too. So we all need to practice good infection control.</p>
<p>"We all need to recognize the symptoms, isolate ourselves, get comfortable, get better and get back to work or school as soon as we can.''</p>

<p>Today's Canada faces an unprecedented number of complex challenges that demand fresh thinking and innovative public policy. The H1N1 influenza virus, the global recession, the war in Afghanistan, and climate change are just a few of the many urgent issues facing government officials at every level across the country.</p>
<p>As a result, it has never been more important that our leaders and decision makers have access to new and creative policy options.</p>
<p>There are a number of examples of governments working with academics on key policy issues such as immigration, poverty, health care, and new technologies to name a few. It should also be acknowledged that some organizations have made extraordinary contributions to the public good.</p>
<p>The Public Policy Forum regularly organizes conferences, debates, roundtables and workshops and conducts original research as part of its commitment to good government, robust public policy and strong democratic institutions from all sectors of society.</p>
<p>The Institute for Research on Public Policy has also made great strides in improving public policy by generating research, providing insight and sparking debate to enhance the public policy decision-making process and strengthen the quality of the public policy decisions. Meanwhile, the Breakfasts on the Hill, organized by the Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences for the past 10 years, have been building better bridges between policy makers and researchers.</p>
<p>And at the University of Ottawa, we have an enormous wealth of intellectual riches from academics studying a myriad of public policy issues. For instance, David Castle, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Science and Society, is focused on understanding the social impact of new science and technology, such as in the area of food safety, to generate better-informed policy making and regulatory development. David Zussman, the first holder of the Stephen Jarislowsky Chair for Public Sector Management, has introduced new ways of thinking about management, governance and accountability in the public sector.</p>
<p>And, what about the work that Michael Hart of the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs at Carleton is doing on Canada's policy challenges with respect to trade and globalization, or the work of Susan Phillips and Les Pal in Canadian public policy and regulation at Carleton's School of Public Policy and Administration?</p>
<p>These are but a few examples of the brain trust available to us ... and that's just here in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Across Canada, similar success stories emerge from other universities. Through their capacity for critical thought and independent research, Canada's universities play a vital role in the development of ideas and nourish a public-policy process that is both open and rigorous.</p>
<p>Based on my experience both as a former federal minister and in my current job, I believe we have a tremendous opportunity to create effective, dynamic and cutting-edge public policy in Canadian universities. We need to build the kind of robust tradition of constructive engagement between cabinet and campus in Canada that is found in other countries.</p>
<p>Our universities are among the best in the world, and we have an outstanding cadre of public policy experts on all the major issues on campuses throughout the country. But we are not maximizing this ocean of talent.</p>
<p>Clearly, we can -- and need to -- lift our game.</p>
<p>To capitalize on the expertise of this enormous knowledge base, we need to change the cultures both in universities and at all levels of government. For Canada to be in the best position to address both urgent and emerging issues of the 21st century, we need to build sustainable bridges over the divides that currently separate all levels of discourse regarding public policy.</p>
<p>Both universities and governments will need to look at how we can be more open and more efficient. This can start with increased secondments and exchanges between universities and governments. But what's really needed is a national dialogue on exploring how to recognize our complementary strengths and establish closer connections.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that conversation has begun.</p>
<p>This Thursday and Friday, the University of Ottawa will host a two-day national public symposium in which I will join forces with the presidents of four other Canadian universities (Winnipeg, Alberta, Waterloo and Montreal) to examine the role of the Canadian university in developing public policy in such areas as foreign affairs, aboriginal issues, the economy, health and the environment.</p>
<p>When examining any issue, it's always important to look beyond our borders to look at what is being done elsewhere. Our keynote speaker, U.S. deputy secretary of state James B. Steinberg, will speak about his own journey from academe to the State Department, and discuss the American tradition of intellectual exchanges. We have also assembled some of the best and brightest Canadian experts from the public sector as well as academia to examine ways in which universities can more consistently contribute to the public policy-making process, suggest approaches that will encourage that input, and ultimately produce recommendations for both universities and governments to consider.</p>
<p>Given the urgency and importance of the issues we face, we are going to need all the intellectual energy we can harness. And the time for change is now.</p>
<p>Allan Rock is a former federal cabinet minister and UN ambassador. He is currently the president and vice-chancellor of the University of Ottawa. For more information on this week's Presidents' National Dialogue, visit uottawa.ca/dialogue.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 virus beginning to grip eastern Ontario</b>
</div><div>David Gonczol, with files from Pauline Tam </div>

<p>Health officials east of Ottawa say the H1N1 flu virus is taking hold there, causing absentee rates of at least 10 percent in 14 area schools.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, medical officer of health for the Eastern Ontario Health Unit, said officials have been randomly testing sick students from schools with high rates of absenteeism and confirming the presence of the virus. Roumeliotis said the schools are in the Cornwall, Rockland and Casselman areas.</p>
<p>"We have an agreement with all the school boards that if a certain school has a high percentage of absenteeism among staff and students, 30 or 40 per cent for example ... if it interferes with the capacity to offer a safe educational environment, they can't do business as usual, we will work with them and close down the school," said Roumeliotis. A decision to close a school during a pandemic has to be made in conjunction with the chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>The Eastern Ontario Health Unit covers the City of Cornwall and the counties of Prescott, Russell, Stormont, Dundas, and Glengarry and serves a population of about 190,000 people over 5,500 square kilometres.</p>
<p>The virus "is pretty much everywhere" in the five counties, with pockets of more activity in some areas; the Hawkesbury area is seeing the least H1N1 activity. Four people have been hospitalized in the territory the unit covers, but there have been no deaths in the so-called second wave of H1N1 this autumn. All of the hospitalized people were between 40 and 60 years old and all had underlying health problems, Roumeliotis said.</p>
<p>He said hospitals in Cornwall, Alexandria, Hawkesbury and Winchester are still coping well with H1N1 infections, though if they become overwhelmed there are plans to open flu assessment centres. These will ensure high-risk patients having difficulty getting care in hospitals will still receive anti-viral drugs such as Tamiflu.</p>
<p>Vaccination clinics are to be opened next week and operated simultaneously at designated high schools two days a week for four weeks throughout the five counties. People with underlying risk factors for serious complications will be the only people to be vaccinated next week at locations in Cornwall, Alexandria, Hawkesbury, Rockland, Winchester and Casselman.</p>
<p>To date, eight Ottawa schools have reported higher than normal absentee rates among their students -- a sign that flu is likely on the rise among children and young adults, who are more likely to be infected by the H1N1 virus than the elderly.</p>
<p>While not all the student absences are likely flu-related officials treat the reports as early warning of potential outbreaks in the city.</p>
<p>Of the 40 lab-confirmed cases of the pandemic flu, two are in school-aged children, said Levy.</p>
<p>Schools are to notify health officials any time more than 10 per cent of their students are absent, a threshold that has been lowered from 15 per cent since the start of the H1N1 pandemic.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Downtown Eastside ‘high priority' for H1N1 shots; Large number of residents ‘susceptible to complications with the flu' due to pre-existing medical conditions, addictions</b>

</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -- Vancouver Coastal Health is including residents of the Downtown Eastside as a priority H1N1 vaccination group.</p>
<p>Outside of remote and isolated communities, the neighbourhood is the only place in B.C. that has been highlighted as having a highly concentrated at-risk population.</p>
<p>“The Downtown Eastside residents are a high priority because it is a neighbourhood with a large number of people with pre-existing medical conditions, obviously, and addiction issues, so they are very susceptible to complications with the flu,” Vancouver Coastal Health spokeswoman Anna Marie D'Angelo said in an interview.</p>
<p>Residents of Canada's poorest postal code join pregnant women, all people with chronic medical conditions, children under the age of five, isolated communities, health-care workers and care providers for at-risk people at the front of the immunization line.</p>
<p>Nurses in the Downtown Eastside are ramping up for an H1N1 immunization blitz which could get under way by the end of the month. “Our target is to immunize as much of the population as possible in the area,” Ms. D'Angelo said.</p>
<p>Armed with a backpack full of supplies, an allergic reaction kit, a cooler of vaccine vials and a syringe disposal, nurses like Vancouver Coastal Health's Shabin Mere will bring the clinic to the patient.</p>
<p>“We go to our usual client homes, single-room occupancies, their apartment buildings, co-operative buildings, sometimes on the streets. If we do approach them on the street, we try to take them into a nice clean area where they can sit down and have their injection,” Ms. Mere said.</p>
<p>A team of two nurses can immunize more than 15 people every day; during past campaigns, more than 6,000 people received vaccinations.</p>
<p>Many of the injections will also be given in community gathering places and will be advertised by word of mouth. Ms. Mere has already seen a heightened awareness about H1N1 in the community, adding most people she's spoken with are interested in the vaccine and are taking precautionary measures to prevent infection.</p>
<p>“To date,” she said, “we haven't seen anything more than we would see in a typical flu season.”</p>
