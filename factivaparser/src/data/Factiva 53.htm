<p>Pregnant women are at a greater risk than the rest of the population of suffering serious complications from swine flu, Canadian health authorities say. Pregnant women who contract the flu virus strain run the risk of premature births and miscarriage, according to Chief Public Health Officer David Butler-Jones. Research suggests that pregnant women are not more susceptible to the A(H1N1) virus, but are at a greater risk of complications if they do get infected, Butler-Jones told reporters.</p>

<p>A Calgary woman who died from H1N1 Thursday is reported to originally be from Yellow Quill First Nation.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services would not name the woman, but family and friends identified her as Vanessa Bluebell, a young mother of four children who moved to Calgary about two years ago.</p>
<p>Bluebell's cousin said Vanessa likely contracted the virus during a recent trip to Saskatchewan, where she grew up on the Yellow Quill First Nation.</p>
<p>She became sick when she returned to Calgary and was admitted to Peter Lougheed Hospital on June 29 before dying early Thursday.</p>
<p>Stella Peeace, a longtime family friend, said it's shocking Bluebell, who was in her mid-20s, died of swine flu, saying she had no history of health problems.</p>
<p>"There was nothing wrong with her. She was healthy," said Peeace.</p>
<p>"She was a good mother. I'm so sorry about her little boys."</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services said the woman was the first person in the province with no pre-existing medical conditions to die from the virus.</p>
<p>H1N1 has infected 9,717 Canadians since the new virus appeared this spring, killing 39 people in the country, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>As of July 10, the Saskatchewan government website cited 848 confirmed cases of H1N1 flu, an increase of 49 in four days.</p>

<p>I won't buy Atlantic salmon that comes out of pens around our Island. I find the flesh rather like flannel, the taste ... well, there's something fishy about it.</p>
<p>Alexandra Morton, though, has no mere culinary bias toward our wild fish. She's convinced that the alien fish farms in our waters are adding to the stresses affecting the wild populations and, if allowed to keep spreading sickness and chemicals, will destroy them.</p>
<p>Those who run the farms, and governments at all levels who place more value on the jobs they produce than the risk, try to paint Morton as some demented sea-witch festooned with kelp. She's not alone, though, for scientific papers keep supporting her contention.</p>
<p>The B.C. Salmon Forum, which produced its report to the provincial government in February, said there's "strong indirect evidence" that salmon farming in the Broughton Archipelago contributes to high sea-lice levels among the wild smolt heading out to sea.</p>
<p>Yes, and there's "strong indirect evidence" that children are starving in Africa, that the globe is warming and there's fighting in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Those who have witnessed the disastrous effects of fish farms on wild stocks in Northern Europe can't understand why we're risking our wild stocks in this way. I can: It's because those who should care, don't. It's because those who should be protecting one of our most priceless assets, won't.</p>
<p>It seems to have surprised some people that the Salmon Forum, under the chairmanship of John Fraser, who has always demonstrated a passion for our environment and ecosystems, didn't call for a moratorium on fish-farm operations.</p>
<p>How could he? The terms of reference issued by the provincial government charged the forum to come up with recommendations to protect wild salmon, sure, but also to enhance the "sustainability of aquaculture," which I've always thought includes fish farms.</p>
<p>Even so, the forum was alarmed enough at the risk to call for a cap on farm production at 1999-2007 levels, immediately in the Broughton Archipelago as a precaution, and expanded subsequently to all other operations until scientific monitoring shows that migrating wild stocks aren't being exposed to sea lice above regulatory thresholds based on natural background levels of the parasites.</p>
<p>It said the government should draw up specifications this year for a pilot project to see if closed-containment farming is economically viable -- something that no one seems to have considered worth the bother before.</p>
<p>It also recommended the province set up a land and water agency by 2012 to oversee all resource industries affecting salmon habitat, including run-of-the-river hydro projects.</p>
<p>The reaction of Ron Cantelon, the B.C. minister responsible at the time, was pretty lackadaisical. "A few changes" to management could be considered. His "bias" was to get results, not "reorganizing everybody."</p>
<p>In any case, the Supreme Court of B.C. said, a week or so after the forum report was released, that fish farms are fisheries, which fall under federal jurisdiction, and ordered the feds to take over by February 2010.</p>
<p>That seems to suit the province fine: It isn't appealing the decision. <span class="companylink">Marine Harvest</span>, the biggest fish-farming operation on our coast, run by Norwegians whose national taste runs to pickled herring, doesn't seem inclined to appeal, either. Why would they bother?</p>
<p>Nothing seems likely to change, as the forum said, unless people force governments to act. Pens are sited precisely where wild fish are forced to run their lousy gauntlet. It's as if newborn babies on their way to the hospital nursery had to pass through the swine-flu infirmary.</p>
<p>The Strathcona Regional District last month approved construction of another huge fish-farm operation right where one-third of our Pacific salmon pass on their voyage back through Johnstone Strait.</p>
<p>Fish farms are violating federal fisheries regulations, Morton says, including using grow lights that attract wild species to the pens.</p>
<p>The federal minister, Gail Shea, came out here on Wednesday to hand over almost $1 million to B.C.'s aquaculture industry.</p>
<p>Someone should have given her a copy of Fraser's report.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Marine Harvest</span> will use its share of the federal lolly to combat a parasite that makes farmed fish flesh flabby.</p>
<p>How can anyone eat that stuff?</p>

</p>
<p>This column was going to be about the number 122, but just a few lines in the number changed to 124. When you're writing about a moving target, you have to be ready to update your numbers.</p>
<p>124 . . .</p>
<p>There were about that many people in my high school graduating class. A few of those people have passed away but the vast majority remains among the living.</p>
<p>There were roughly that many people in all the courses that made up my first year of university. I have no information on the death toll of the 1977-78 University of Saskatchewan students enrolled in introductory philosophy, economics, history, English and psychology. I imagine it is relatively low.</p>
<p>124 . . .</p>
<p>That's roughly the number of people who might attend one of those Chamber of Commerce breakfast seminars, the ones with the insightful speaker, an abundance of muffins and door prizes.</p>
<p>That's about a dozen recreational slo-pitch teams.</p>
<p>That's about as many kids as you might see on a hot summer day throwing themselves into a public swimming pool, or the size of the sunbathing crowd on one of those gravelly Guelph Lake beaches.</p>
<p>124 . . .</p>
<p>The other day, after the number changed from 122 to 124, I ran a <span class="companylink">Google</span> News search of the number 124. Jamal Robertson, the Toronto Argos running back, ran for 124 yards in a victory over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. Nice job, Jamal!</p>
<p>Traffic was not yet flowing smoothly and completely through a roundabout on Highway 124 in Chippewa Falls.</p>
<p>There was an apartment fire on 124 Street in Edmonton that sent two people to hospital.</p>
<p>The Lahore Stock Exchange gained 124 points. Nice going, Lahore!</p>
<p>The incidents of H1N1 flu cases in Malaysia rose to 124.</p>
<p>And, the official number of Canadian soldiers killed in Afghanistan rose to 124. Once again comrades of the dead assembled at the Kandahar Airfield, the third such assembly in four days, to bid a tearful farewell to the latest of their ranks to die in a war that is reported to be getting deadlier by the week.</p>
<p>"Let us be under no illusion,'' said British Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth, soon after the seventh British soldier was killed in Afghanistan. That's 117 less than the number 124, which is 602 less than 726, the number of American soldiers killed in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>"The way forward is hard and dangerous,'' Ainsworth concluded. "More lives will be lost.''</p>
<p>Around this same time, more than a billion minds the world over were focused on a memorial service for a dead pop star whose life over the past 20 years had become a kind of surreal freak-show of drug addiction, sexual weirdness, publicity stunts and artistic ruin. I didn't watch the memorial or follow it on the news, but apparently there was a gold-plated coffin and Brooke Shields said a few words.</p>
<p>Why have 124 Canadian soldiers died in Afghanistan? Why have 726 American soldiers died there? Why 11 Romanians, 33 Germans, three Latvians, 14 Italians, 19 Dutch, 24 Danes . . .? Why have some 12,000 Afghan troops and about 7,500 Afghan civilians died? Why all this death?</p>
<p>Afghanistan has been the target of empire-builders for centuries. The death toll in the country since the first Anglo-Afghan War of 1838 has numbered in the hundreds of thousands, as one empire after another recognized its strategic value in Asia, both as a trade route and a military buffer zone. They fought to control it.</p>
<p>Russia began annexing pieces of the country as early as the late 1800s, and Germany advanced on it leading up to the First World War.</p>
<p>Russia returned during the Cold War, and now America and its allies are there, fighting for the kind of control others have been denied in the past.</p>
<p>I wonder what the number will be this time next week.</p>

</p>
<p>Canada's pork industry needs an immediate injection of$800 million in government aid to solve a liquidity crisis that's pushed the sector to the brink of disaster, a Calgary rally heard Friday.</p>
<p>The Canadian hog industry is losing about $3.4 million a day, as the financial toll from three years of high feed costs, trade issues and a robust loonie, followed by the fallout from H1N1 influenza, prove too much for producers to bear.</p>
<p>"Most of us are struggling to make our monthly payments to our feed costs, our veterinary supplies, our salaries, our wages and all of that," Jurgen Preugschas, president of the Canadian Pork Council, said Friday at the Alberta Pork rally.</p>
<p>It was aimed at raising awareness about the plight of hog producers in Alberta, which some say is on the verge of collapse. More than 2,400 people attended the event.</p>
<p>The number of Alberta pork producers has fallen to 450 from 1,500 three years ago, the rally was told.</p>
<p>Hog producer Alfred Neufeld said there used to be eight producers in the Acme-Crossfield area. Today he's the only one left.</p>
<p>Neufeld said hog producers are sinking deeper and deeper into debt and losing equity, and current government programs aren't enough anymore.</p>
<p>Alberta Pork has made five proposals to Alberta Agriculture Minister George Groeneveld. They were expected to be raised at a meeting of Canada's agriculture ministers this week in Ontario.</p>
<p>Federal minister Gerry Ritz said Friday the ministers' spent a lot of time discussing ways they can continue to support pork farmers.</p>
<p>"We also know that it's vitally important to make sure that efforts to help don't provoke devastating trade challenges," Ritz said.</p>
<p>The emphasis was on strengthening existing programs, though few specifics were offered.</p>
<p>Asked what message he had for the Alberta Pork rally, Groeneveld said he didn't think Alberta pork producers were expecting a funding announcement.</p>
<p>"We're there in a support role to show them that we care. As the other ministers have said, there's programs out there that we can help them with, and will work for them at the end of the day," Groeneveld said.</p>
<p>Added Ritz: "We will continue to work with them at whatever level to make sure they have that liquidity."</p>
<p>Paul Hodgman, executive director of Alberta Pork, said the usual government programs don't work in catastrophic situations.</p>

<p>U.S. health officials say H1N1 activity is dying down a bit, but the number of cases has surpassed 37,000 and deaths hit 211. The numbers rose from 170 deaths and nearly 34,000 confirmed and suspected H1N1 cases reported last week. Officials believe those cases -- which sought treatment and underwent testing -- are just the tip of the iceberg. They estimate more than one million Americans have been infected with the virus.</p>

<p>Photo: DAVE SIDAWAY, THE GAZETTE / Riding out the slump:
Montreal's tourist industry is definitely feeling the pinch.
Hotel-room bookings were down 11 per cent in June, despite the fact
prices fell sharply to an average of $138 a night from $170 a year
ago and there were 1.3 per cent more rooms available than in 2008.
So far this year, the occupancy rate is down five per cent, to 57
per cent. Poor summer weather, a difficult economy, new U.S.
passport rules, swine-flu concerns and the loss of Montreal's
Formula One auto race have all contributed to the drop, said Martine
Lizotte, research and public-relations manager for the Greater
Montreal Tourism Bureau. "It's a hard year, full of challenges, but
we expected it." Fall should be better because of the number of
international conventions already booked, she said. Lizotte said
it's too early to determine the extent of the impact on
international visits this year. In 2007, the last year for which
statistics are available, Americans represented about seven per cent
of all tourist visits to Montreal. France and Britain, together,
accounted for about two per cent.

<p>A new vaccine "challenge" unit -- the first of its kind in Canada -- opened Friday in Halifax. Studies conducted at the Sanofi Pasteur Vaccine Challenge Unit -- housed at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology -- will involve immunizing volunteers against a virus before exposing them to the pathogen to test how well a vaccine works, said Dr. Shelly McNeil, medical director of the new unit. The viruses to be tested will result in only mild illness, and with easily available treatment options, but will not include the H1N1 swine flu virus, said McNeil. "These studies are important because they let us look at how effective a vaccine is likely to be in large clinical trials, but much sooner in the development process," said McNeil. "We can get a sense very early on if a vaccine is going to work."</p>

<p>NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE</p>
<p>Canadian farmers are skeptical that a $20-million federal investment announced yesterday to track livestock from grocery stores around the world back to Canadian farms will help beleaguered producers.</p>
<p>Federal Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz unveiled the Livestock Auction Traceability Initiative at the end of a meeting between federal, provincial and territorial agriculture ministers in Niagara-on-the-Lake.</p>
<p>Ritz said the move will help to restore global confidence in Canadian meat -- confidence that recently took a hit due to swine flu concerns.</p>
<p>The traceability initiative will increase Canada's competitiveness in the global livestock trade, Ritz said, especially in emerging Asian markets, where countries are calling on Canada to adopt such measures. Ritz said Canada used to be a leader in traceability capabilities but is now playing catchup with countries like Argentina, Australia and the U.S.</p>
<p>"A strong traceability system makes it possible to track down problems quickly when they happen,'' Ritz said. "It will allow individual Canadian producers to take credit for those premium steaks Canadian families pick up at the grocery store.''</p>
<p>But the National Farmers Union said the initiative will do nothing to increase farmers' profits because it doesn't include labelling regulations.</p>
<p>Union president Stewart Wells said that without proper labelling regulations, the program will not help consumers decide on Canadian products at the grocery store.</p>
<p>"As long as that production is still sitting on a store shelf beside something that might have come in from China . . . and consumers don't know where the other production has come from, it's just sitting there at a lower price because the information is denied to them."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Strategic blueprint foresees slimmed-down hog industry - Pork council angles for government help to ease transition</b>
</div><div>Rural Revival / Laura Rance   </div>
<div>841 words</div><div>11 July 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>B9</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>The Strategic Transition Plan released by the Canadian Pork Council last week is a radical departure from previous efforts to engage the rest of Canadians in sharing the pork industry's ongoing financial pain.</p>
<p>"It is understood that it is not in Canada's interest to simply prop up the industry in an attempt to maintain the status quo," the document says in its introduction.</p>
<p>The multi-faceted strategic plan that follows is remarkable in its acknowledgment that it needs to reassess the assumptions that led to the worst crisis the industry has seen in 60 years and its acceptance of its own responsibility for ensuring it doesn't happen again.</p>
<p>Up until recently, calls for public help from the hog industry have been all about tiding producers over until the rest of the world smartened up. The new plan is about transforming the sector in line with market realities.</p>
<p>"It will be based on tough assumptions about key operating variables. For example we will assume that the U.S.-Canada exchange rates will be closer to parity than to their historic lows; feed grains will remain stubbornly high and live hog prices will be constantly under pressure. The strategy will therefore be focused on succeeding in a difficult business environment."</p>
<p>That is precisely opposite to the assumptions that drove the industry's rapid growth over the past two decades.</p>
<p>This is not to suggest the industry has done everything wrong. On the contrary, Canada's exports of pork since the mid-1990s have increasingly diversified away from its previous focus on the domestic and American markets. However, a significant proportion of the pigs produced in this country, chiefly from Manitoba, were exported as livestock to U.S. feeders -- a phenomenon that made the industry vulnerable to market disruptions.</p>
<p>Productivity gains were notable as well. Producers increased sow productivity; pig production grew by 79 per cent with only a 23 per cent increase in the sow herd. But that productivity growth couldn't be sustained. A disease called circovirus began surfacing in barns in 2005 and spread rapidly through eastern Canadian operations, despite the industry's best efforts at biosecurity. Affected barns suffered high rates of mortality and poor performance.</p>
<p>The loonie soared, the U.S. implemented country-of-origin labelling legislation, and ethanol's huge appetite for corn drove up feed prices. Then hysteria about H1N1 affected pork consumption.</p>
<p>As a result, producers are losing $40 per pig sold and they are, quite simply, losing their shirts -- despite relatively large sums of money from government support programs designed to offset short-term profitability downturns.</p>
<p>The council divides those left in the sector into three categories: producers who want out without losing everything, producers who are hanging on simply because they entered this downturn without a lot of debt, and those who would like to take advantage of this opportunity to expand.</p>
<p>But there is still the matter of who will pay the cost of digging out and who will be left to reap the benefits of the newly transformed industry once the bleeding stops. The council's plan calls on taxpayers -- no surprise there -- on the basis that doing nothing could have consequences that reach far beyond the hog barn. "It would be damaging to Canada's interests in terms of its economic prospects and rural viability if the productive capacity of the Canadian hog industry was to implode. It could recede to a level that threatens too many direct production and processing jobs, export sales and the exploitation of new technology development opportunities."</p>
<p>The council wants money to pay people to leave, loans for those who want to stay in until prices recover, and extensions on existing loans and advances.</p>
<p>It's just a hunch, but it's highly likely this transition will all but eliminate the last of the independent producers, leaving the sector in the hands of producers owned by the packers or with direct links to them.</p>
<p>In return, the council is promising to deliver Canadians a "right-sized" industry by 2014 that produces fewer hogs and focuses first on meeting domestic needs, with exports second. It is proposing a lower dependence on the U.S. market for both live hogs and pork.</p>
<p>It is also promising to pay more than lip service to the competitiveness issues, as well as to disease, environmental and welfare concerns. It says it is ready to act on the impact that liquid manure storage, and methane and nitrous oxide from soil application of liquid manure, are having on global warming. "The technology exists for the industry to harness GHGs and produce renewable electricity and heat energy. We will help facilitate the investment in these technologies."</p>
<p>It all sounds good on paper. But will governments buy in?</p>

<p>The furthest thing from the minds of most people at the Craven Country Jamboree is the fear of catching H1N1, but organizers are prepared just in case the flu does appear.</p>
<p>"We're just taking a proactive approach because of the level of concern among the public," explained Belinda Mitchell, superintendent of patient care services for St. John Ambulance, which has a presence on the festival grounds.</p>
<p>Mitchell gave the Leader-Post a tour of a 12-bed isolation area where patients displaying any symptoms could be quarantined.</p>
<p>This year marks the first time such a facility has been on-site at Craven, and its setup was due to H1N1 concerns, she added. The area is well-ventilated -- basically, it's outside -- as better airflow helps reduce the spread of airborne pathogens. That applies to the whole festival.</p>
<p>"As long as the area is well-ventilated, the risk is less," Mitchell said of the potential for H1N1 to spread in the campgrounds. "There's always risk. Do I think it's going to be a big concern out here? Should we panic? I don't think so."</p>
<p>The quarantine area hadn't been used as of Friday afternoon. If it is needed, anyone who enters the area will be required to don protective equipment.</p>
<p>"We don't diagnose them here," Mitchell noted. "We just take the precautions."</p>
<p>A doctor is always on call, and health authorities on-site are well-stocked with necessary supplies to prevent the spread of disease, including masks and hand sanitizer -- which Mitchell explained is "probably the easiest way to protect yourself against these viruses."</p>
<p>As proper handwashing is important, bathrooms with running water at the grounds are stocked with antibacterial soap and washing instructions, added Kim Blevins, director of marketing and communications for the music festival.</p>
<p>"Whatever precautions we can take are being taken," she said on Friday.</p>
<p>Anyone concerned about any flu-like symptoms can visit the first aid centre for information.</p>
<p>Anyone who is really sick might want to seek help elsewhere.</p>
<p>"Craven's fun," said Mitchell. "Nobody likes to leave. But if you do have symptoms, be checked out by a doctor."</p>
<p>Mark Torjusen, spokesman for the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region, reiterated the advice that those who develop symptoms should return home, and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen.</p>
<p>"There are no 'specific' measures one can take," he stated, noting frequent hand-cleaning and coughing and sneezing into tissues or sleeves are principles that apply. Those with any illness are advised to limit contact with others.</p>
<p>Most campers asked about H1N1 concerns said they weren't worried at all.</p>
<p>"Beer cures everything," Jesse Loyns from Naicam reasoned between laughs.</p>

<p>Emma Nichol, from North Battleford, offered a similar line of reasoning, punctuated by whooping and cheering.</p>
<p>"We're just trying to have fun," she said. "That's all! We're not going to worry about that kind of stuff. We're at Craven -- who cares?"</p>

</p>
<p>After more than a decade of declining tourism from Japan, the visit of its Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko today could well provide a much-needed boost to B.C.'s tourism industry.</p>
<p>Paul Vallee, Tourism Vancouver's executive vice-president, said the immensely popular monarchs could encourage Japanese visitors -- once a dominant source of tourism for B.C. -- to return.</p>
<p>"The Japanese market has long been a declining market since the mid-90s, for a whole host of reasons," said Vallee. "Whether it was the banking crisis in Asia in the '90s to the fluctuating exchange rate, it's a market that has lost a lot of its value to B.C. With something like this, it's very helpful. As we know, the emperor and empress are looked upon very favourably."</p>
<p>In 2008, Vancouver hosted 140,000 Japanese visitors, a fraction of the 8.6 million total visitors to the city.</p>
<p>Japan's 75-year-old emperor and his 74-year-old wife arrive in Vancouver this afternoon, following a seven-day tour of Ottawa and Toronto.</p>
<p>The goodwill visit is to mark the 80th anniversary of the establishment of Canada's first diplomatic mission in Japan.</p>
<p>Naoto Horita, who sits on the board of directors of Nikkei Place in Burnaby, agreed the much-publicized visit could help alleviate Japanese travel fears about Canada.</p>
<p>Horita noted that Japanese tourists cancelled trips to B.C. in the wake of news that three Japanese citizens who travelled to Ontario in May became the first confirmed cases of the H1N1 flu virus in Japan upon their return home.</p>
<p>The emperor and empress, who rarely travel outside their country, were followed to Canada by an entourage of more than 40 Japanese journalists, filing stories after each event.</p>
<p>The royals will visit Vancouver and Victoria over the next four days, leaving for the U.S. on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The public appearances include a walkabout at</p>
<p>5:15 p.m. at Government House in Victoria today, an appearance outside the Parliament Buildings at 10:55 a.m. tomorrow followed by a visit to the Vancouver Japanese Language School and Japanese Hall, in the 400-block Alexander Street, at 2:40 p.m.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pork producers issue plea; Alberta industry could collapse without aid, says association</b>
</div><div>Gina Teel </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>

</p>
<p>A lberta's beleaguered pork producers are asking the federal government for some form of immediate financial aid to help Canada's struggling hog industry make it through to better times.</p>
<p>Alberta Pork had asked provincial Agricultural Minister George Groeneveld to raise the issue of emergency funds for the industry, which is at the brink of collapse, at Thursday's meeting of federal, provincial and territorial ministers of agriculture in Ontario.</p>
<p>"We need to have some way to get some liquidity in this business to bridge us over into -- actually, it will be 2010 before this thing turns around," said Paul Hodgman, executive director of Alberta Pork.</p>
<p>Alberta's $1.2-billion pork industry has been whacked with steep losses for the past three years, due in large part to a high loonie and soaring feed grain prices.</p>
<p>Hopes of returning profits this spring were quickly extinguished by the advent of H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Hodgman said Alberta is now on the brink of losing its hog industry in the countrywide collapse.</p>
<p>The organization has put forth five options to help, and is hoping to have some sort of government answer to its plight in time for an industry crisis rally to be held today in Calgary.</p>
<p>The options are to consolidate loans at a viable interest rate; develop short-term ledger loan programs; put the situation in disaster status to stimulate cash under Agri-Recovery and AgriStability programs, and other forms of support.</p>
<p>The valuation of assets also needs to be reviewed, he said, "because if your assets continue to be devalued because of market conditions, it's very difficult to obtain cash."</p>
<p>Hodgman said the point is to get some cash here quickly, "or the doors are just going to be shutting."</p>
<p>Cathy Housdorff, spokesman for Alberta Agriculture, said Groeneveld planned to discuss the state of the pork industry with his counterparts at the ministerial meeting, "because it's certainly not limited to Alberta."</p>
<p>"He'll take concerns forward," she said.</p>
<p>Doug Griffiths, the minister's parliamentary assistant, will attend today's rally, she added.</p>
<p>The rally will be held on the grounds of McDougall Centre in Calgary from 11:30 a. m. to 1:30 p. m.</p>
<p>Pork producers aim to raise awareness about their plight, and particularly what's at stake if the producer liquidity crisis is not addressed immediately.</p>
<p>"This has been such a long haul with financial problems, and so everybody is now really finding it difficult to pay bills, to even get credit," Hodgman said.</p>
<p>"Things have been pulled back at the bank, there's no equity left. It's getting to be a very, very serious situation," he said.</p>
<p>There are fewer than 450 producers in Alberta today compared with 1,500 producers in 2004.</p>
<p>As well, there's been a reduction of more than one million market hogs produced in the province, he said.</p>
<p>Alberta Pork is prepared to serve 3,000 pork-on-a-bun sandwiches from noon until 1:30 p. m.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in showing support is welcome to attend, Hodgman said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hogs risk getting flu from humans</b>
</div><div>Steve Rennie   </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>German scientists are warning of a pig pandemic after tests suggested the swine flu can pass from humans to hogs and then infect a whole herd.</p>
<p>A team of virologists at Germany's national animal health research lab recently infected five pigs with the human strain of the H1N1 virus and put the sick pigs in a room with three healthy pigs.</p>
<p>Within four days, all the pigs had the flu. All of them recovered.</p>
<p>A research paper to be published today in the Journal of General Virology warns "the high transmissibility of the virus observed in humans also applies to pigs.''</p>
<p>That increasingly puts pigs at risk as the virus spreads among humans.</p>
<p>"It must be assumed that this virus will spread fast and efficiently if introduced into swine farms, possibly establishing endemic infections,'' the paper says.</p>
<p>"With the increasing numbers of human infections, a spillover of this virus to pigs is becoming more likely.''</p>
<p>There is no evidence pigs are passing the swine flu virus to humans, or that eating pork products poses an infection risk.</p>
<p>Dr. Thomas Vahlenkamp, who headed the team of virologists at Germany's Friedrich Loeffler Institute, said the tests show how susceptible pigs are to the virus.</p>
<p>"We would not claim that the virus can easily be transmitted to pigs,'' he said. "But at least if the pig is infected, it can transmit it quite easily between pigs.''</p>
<p>The Canadian Pork Council says fears of a pig pandemic are overblown since the animals are kept away from people.</p>
<p>"It's not like . . . some of the other animals or livestock that are just out in a field,'' spokesperson Gary Stordy said.</p>
<p>"Since they are in enclosed structures with ventilation, there's very minimal contact with unauthorized (people) or the general public. There's generally very limited access to a farm just because of biosecurity measures.''</p>
<p>This is not the first time researchers have shown pigs can catch the human strain of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>British scientists ran similar tests in May with the same results. But it's believed the German scientists are the first to publish their findings in a scientific journal.</p>
<p>The Germans also added a twist to their experiment by throwing five chickens into the mix to see if the birds would catch the virus from the sick pigs. But the fowls stayed fit.</p>
<p>Researchers then tried to directly infect the chickens with the virus, to no avail.</p>
<p>Canada is only one of two places where the pandemic virus has been found in pigs. The other is Argentina.</p>

<p>Alberta has recorded its third H1N1 death. Alberta Health says a woman with no underlying medical issues was admitted to a Calgary hospital on June 29 and immediately tested for the virus. Officials say she was isolated and died Wednesday after the virus attacked her respiratory system. Dr. Richard Musto, Calgary's medical officer of health, says the victim was young, but her age has not been released. The death is the second related to the virus in the province this week. Across Canada, 39 people have now died from H1N1.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Barn blazes turn up heat on building codes; Scenes of dying animals have become disturbingly common for firefighters in Manitoba, where regulations fail to reflect modern farms</b>
</div><div>PATRICK WHITE   </div>
<div>585 words</div><div>10 July 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>WINNIPEG -- By the time fire chief John Schroeder arrived on the scene, the barn was fully engulfed and more than 25,000 chickens lay dead inside.</p>
<p>Most succumbed to smoke before flame early Tuesday morning, so Mr. Schroeder didn't have to hear them die. But even without a head full of animal screams – a haunting noise that has sent many rural Manitoba firefighters into counselling – the veteran chief found it a difficult scene.</p>
<p>“It was devastation,” said Mr. Schroeder, chief for the town of Kleefeld, 60 kilometres south of Winnipeg. “There was no life left when we got there. No chance of saving anything.”</p>
<p>Such scenes of mass immolation have become disturbingly common for fire departments in farming communities. While livestock structures have evolved greatly since the 1970s – with computer automation giving way to 120,000 square-foot barns holding upward of 150,000 animals – the building code for them has not.</p>
<p>Last year, more than 31,000 animals perished in barn fires – eight times the number that died the year before, according to statistics kept by the Office of the Fire Commissioner. This year's tally is pacing toward a record with more than 30,900 animals already dead.</p>
<p>Animal-rights groups have long said the province needs to stiffen rules on farm buildings. Now, the fire commissioner apparently agrees, inviting comments on a discussion paper regarding farm building codes for the past two months.</p>
<p>“We'd noticed a large number of losses over the last 10 years,” said deputy fire commissioner Chris Jones. “A number of these incidences are occurring due to lack of maintenance, overloading of circuits and faulty mechanical systems.”</p>
<p>While rights groups applaud the move toward regulating farm buildings, they worry new regulations may still disregard the value of animal life.</p>
<p>“It seems that the new code will be based on human occupancy, rather than animal occupancy,” said Liz White, director of Animal Alliance Canada, who has sent a number of suggestions to the commissioner. “We are not asking for the same fire codes that apply to public or private buildings, but I don't know anyone who thinks it's okay for thousands of animals to burn alive. There is an animal-welfare component that farmers should have to take into account here.”</p>
<p>Ms. White wants a new code to mandate the installation of sprinklers, fire walls, smoke alarms and fire-retardant surfaces – all monitored by mandatory inspections.</p>
<p>The organization may soon appeal for international intervention, claiming that Canadian regulations surrounding the treatment of animals constitutes an unfair trade advantage.</p>
<p>“We have a very good argument that may bring about trade embargoes,” Ms. White said.</p>
<p>The hog industry, already reeling from swine flu and high feed prices, says any increased cost could be too dear.</p>
<p>“Some of these recommendations would be far too expensive and are not going to work anyway,” said Ian Wishart, a farmer and president of the Keystone Agricultural Producers, a farm lobby group. “With the sprinklers, many areas don't even have the water to make sprinklers effective.”</p>
<p>The commissioner's discussion paper calculates that a new code would raise construction costs by 2 to 4 per cent.</p>
<p>“We've had hundreds of responses to the paper, which is good,” Mr. Jones said. “It's generating a lively discussion.”</p>

<p>HALIFAX -- The chief public health officer for Nova Scotia is fearing a spike in H1N1 infections unless people with flu-like symptoms heed their “better judgment and their altruism” and stay away from a series of major tourism events beginning this weekend.</p>
<p>The plea from Robert Strang was accompanied by news that the province's number of H1N1 cases has climbed to 210, jumping nearly 20 per cent in the past week. There have been no deaths but Nova Scotia's doctors are seeing an increase in more serious cases.</p>
<p>With four internationally promoted events expected to attract, collectively, more than 100,000 people in Halifax over the next week, he called a news conference yesterday to warn against complacency. He urged the public to take seriously the risk of the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu, spreading in large gatherings.</p>
<p>“You may not be that severely ill but the person that you spread it to beside you could get severely ill and perhaps even die,” Dr. Strang said.</p>
<p>“Flu is a very infectious disease in a closed environment. Even … outdoors, [if] there's lots of people very closely packed together, that's a high-risk environment for transmitting.”</p>
<p>His comments come as the province's $1.3-billion tourism industry, which has struggled this year in the weak economy, is about to kick into top gear.</p>
<p>Up to 60,000 spectators are expected tomorrow in central Halifax to watch Paul McCartney play his only Canadian gig this year. The weeklong local jazz festival begins tonight and the tall ships festival starts next week. Glam rockers KISS are expected to draw tens of thousands next Saturday for another downtown concert.</p>
<p>“We're appealing to people's better judgment and their altruism,” Dr. Strang said. “It's not there at the level that we need to be cancelling events. But what we're doing is asking people to take some personal responsibility. Protect yourself, protect your fellow citizen. If you're sick, stay home. If you're not sick, enjoy summer.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a local arena was turned into a makeshift clinic, testing hundreds of military members associated with the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo after a dancer with the event was found to have the virus. That testing had not turned up any additional cases, Dr. Strang said yesterday.</p>
<p>As scientists race to understand the virus, The Canadian Press reported that research to be published today in the Journal of General Virology warns of a pig pandemic. Tests by German scientists suggest swine flu can pass from humans to hogs and quickly spread through an entire herd.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that pigs are passing the swine flu virus to humans, or that eating pork poses an infection risk.</p>

<p>In its March 25 budget, the province had forecast the need for a Fiscal Stabilization Account withdrawal of $98 million for 2008-2009 because of early economic stimulus spending and money targeted to reduce health-care wait times.</p>
<p>But higher-than-budgeted revenues mean the government won't have to dip into the piggy bank to balance the books on 2008-09 after all, Doer said.</p>
<p>"The rainy day fund will remain (at) more than $800 million, giving Manitoba some shock absorbers in terms of maintaining vital programs going into the 09-10 year," he said.</p>
<p>The official report closing the books on 2008-2009 has yet to be released.</p>
<p>Doer said that so far in the current fiscal year, there have been no big surprises in government revenues. However, costs have risen due to battling the H1N1 flu outbreak as well as this spring's flood. The province expects eventually to recoup a portion of its flood-related expenses from the federal government.</p>
<p>In its March budget, the Doer government projected a $110-million withdrawal from the rainy day fund for the current fiscal year. As well, it passed legislation allowing it to make smaller debt payments than previously mandated.</p>
<p>Doer said although the flood, the H1N1 flu and other issues have been garnering headlines, the economy has remained the government's primary focus.</p>
<p>"I would say that in our cabinet agenda, we are spending 80 per cent of our time on the economy in its broadest sense."</p>
<p>Manitoba seems to be faring better than most other provinces in battling the recession. RBC (Royal Bank) recently projected that Manitoba is among only three provinces that will show any growth in real gross domestic product this year at 0.5 per cent. Saskatchewan (0.7 per cent) and Nova Scotia (0.2 per cent) are the others.</p>
<p>Doer said economic problems south of the border are, however, taking a toll on Manitoba's economy, which is heavily reliant on U.S. exports.</p>
<p>"I think Manitoba people are doing very, very well. If we were only selling to each other we'd be fine. We're not."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Medics ready for fall flu onslaught - Plan for overwhelming number of cases that will tax resources</b>
</div><div>By Carol Sanders </div>

</p>
<p>As Manitoba's sixth death linked to H1N1 virus was announced Wednesday, paramedics and front-line workers said they are bracing for a lot more.</p>
<p>"If things get as bad as they potentially could in the fall, we're facing some very serious issues," said Chris Broughton, one of 220 Winnipeg paramedics.</p>
<p>"Based on statistical models, 30 to 40 per cent of our staff could be ill and -- this is an absolute worst-case scenario -- we could have four or five of our own staff die," said the president of the Manitoba Government Employees' Union, Local 911.</p>
<p>"We're planning for overwhelming call volumes and basically trying to do the impossible with nearly half our staff."</p>
<p>The adult whose H1N1-linked death was reported Wednesday was between the ages of 18 and 65. The province also reported 102 new confirmed cases of H1N1 flu, bringing the Manitoba total to 787.</p>
<p>The health-care system is bracing for a deluge of flu this fall, when school resumes and people are back indoors in close quarters.</p>
<p>The city and the regional health authority are hiring part-time paramedic staff for the fall, Broughton said. Manitoba Health has supplies and contracts with suppliers in place.</p>
<p>"We're as stocked as humanly possible. But the reality is, if this does get as bad as it could get, everyone is going to be trying to manage an overwhelming influx in the health-care system with limited resources," Broughton said. "We aren't unique in this situation. We have to manage with what we have."</p>
<p>On Monday, 23 Manitobans were severely ill and needed to be on ventilators in an intensive-care unit. The province has 186 ventilators along with 15 ventilators from the national stockpile that have not been used yet.</p>
<p>In northern and remote communities, where a spike in flu cases made headlines last spring, plans are in place to get air ambulances dispatched more quickly to where they're needed most.</p>
<p>Manitoba Health has arranged with the federal First Nation and Inuit Health Branch to take over dispatch of air ambulances during an outbreak, freeing up nursing station staff to take care of patients.</p>
<p>"What happens in places like St. Theresa Point is nurses are taking a lot of time on the phone trying to get an ambulance," said Gerry Delorme, director of Manitoba Health's office of disaster management.</p>
<p>"On June 8, the First Nation and Inuit Health Branch told the province we are having a problem -- we need you to assist with (medevacs) from the North," Delorme said.</p>
<p>On June 10, Manitoba Health stepped in to help with air ambulance dispatch. "Fifty per cent of cases were related to (influenza-like illness)." Delorme said seven of the 14 air ambulance calls that day were for flu and came from Shamattawa, Norway House, South Indian Lake and St. Theresa Point.</p>
<p>"Our busiest day was June 17," Delorme said. "We had 18 dispatches, but only five were (for) respiratory (flu)."</p>
<p>At the peak of the flu surge, the system worked, he said.</p>
<p>"We never exceeded the capacity of the system at times of high utilization," Delorme said.</p>
<p>"One of the things we're doing now is to look at how this worked and making sure it's a really well-oiled machine for fall."</p>
<p>In Winnipeg, the fire paramedic service and its unions are working together on a plan to redeploy workers where they're needed, said Christian Schmidt, deputy chief of operations.</p>
<p>"We know who has what training and where we can use them," Schmidt said. "Fortunately we have a highly skilled, highly diverse work force."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no one can predict the future.</p>
<p>"We really don't know what we're facing," Broughton said.</p>
<p>"We're going to have to make do with what we have and hope the virus doesn't mutate and become a significant threat."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Lack of babies threatens our way of life; Canada has turned to immigration to solve its population problem but that is not working</b>
</div><div>Leonard Stern </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>902 words</div><div>9 July 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun </div>
</p>
<p>The headlines are swine flu, terrorism and climate change, but economists know that the real threat to our way of life is the reluctance of women to produce lots of babies.</p>
<p>Well, not just any women. This is about women in the industrialized West. In poor parts of the world women have plenty of children. Unfortunately, they can't afford them.</p>
<p>Here in the wealthy West we can afford to have more children but we don't. It's the population paradox.</p>
<p>Canada's fertility rate is about 1.54 children per woman. The rate needs to be 2.1 simply to replace ourselves, never mind growing the population. A nation that doesn't replace itself becomes an aging nation, and that's why economists are terrified. Old people no longer generate wealth yet they require huge amounts of state support in the form of health care, pensions and other programs.</p>
<p>Babies are cute and all, but their real value is that they grow up, get jobs and contribute to economic growth. Japan's low fertility rate of barely 1.3 children per woman represents as much an existential threat to that country as the nuclear manoeuvrings of North Korea.</p>
<p>If Canada has never really sounded the alarm about the low fertility rate, it's because we had an antidote: immigration. After all, we're a nation that is comfortable with, and even celebrates, multiculturalism. Most of us were ourselves once newcomers. A Japanese diplomat once told me that his assignment in Canada was to acquire lessons on the merits of multiculturalism in an effort to convince the Japanese people that, for them also, immigration will fix the problem of an aging society.</p>
<p>Now it turns out that the curative power of immigration was vastly overstated. The sobering revelation arrived this week courtesy of the C.D. Howe Institute, the eminent Canadian think tank.</p>
<p>The C.D. Howe folks crunched the numbers, did the modeling, and discovered that the current influx of immigrants -- about 0.67 per cent of the resident population -- barely makes a dent.</p>
<p>The data show that the only way immigration could offset the declining birth rate is if Canada dismantles border control and floods the country with well over a half million immigrants a year. Even then, the government would need to impose rigid "age filters" to ensure that only young people are among the new arrivals.</p>
<p>This is radical stuff and therefore politically unfeasible.</p>
<p>The security issues are obvious. Absorption would be impossible. The age filters would spell the end of family reunification and would be objected to on humane grounds.</p>
<p>The C.D. Howe acknowledges as much, concluding that time has come to look at alternatives to immigration. If Canadians don't want the country to go bankrupt, then we have to start working harder (boosting "output" per worker) and having a lot more children.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these are incompatible goals. The more we are forced to boost our output at the office or factory, the less likely we are to have children.</p>
<p>It's true, for example, that by working insanely hard, the Japanese are able to maintain high productivity despite their low fertility rate. But a 17-hour work day in a Tokyo cubicle, where you feel guilty taking bathroom breaks, is hardly a family-friendly environment. Japan is committing suicide by creating a culture littered with disincentives to childbearing.</p>
<p>So how do we get western women to have more children? There's evidence that accessible childcare and similar supports are a big help. But even free daycare might not constitute an "incentive" to have children. At most, it represents the elimination of an obstacle.</p>
<p>The brutal truth is this: The only sure-fire way to ensure women have lots of children is to deny them sexual equality. (Needless to say, this is an approach I'd oppose.)</p>
<p>Equality has meant giving women opportunities for personal fulfillment beyond childrearing. It has meant that for women, social status is now derived from the same things as for men -- educational achievement, professional advancement, accumulation of wealth.</p>
<p>Conversely, where women achieve status mainly through their role as matriarch you'll find a high birthrate. You don't have to travel to exotic places to find such societies. Right here in the West there are communities where women routinely have five, six, seven children, but these are almost always religious communities -- devout Muslims, Orthodox Jews, serious Catholics and the like.</p>
<p>The birthrate is high not just because women derive status only through the role of matriarch; the birthrate is high because men and women feel they are custodians of sacred traditions and teachings that must be preserved, from generation to generation. (It's also worth noting that among those beliefs is opposition to birth control).</p>
<p>Individual autonomy is among the great benefits of the secular West. We are liberated from the obligation to reproduce ourselves. It's all about choice, as it should be. Too bad there's no way, at least none that I can think of, to get young liberal westerners to choose parenthood.</p>

that is required for the population to replace itself.

</p>
<p>VICTORIA -- First came the Chicken Little reports. Then came the predictable lull, a hushed period of post-hysteria updates. Now we know the chicken was just under the weather. It's his pal, Porky, who's sicker than a dog.</p>
<p>Through it all, for the past four years, Crawford Kilian has dutifully monitored reports from around the world, posting regularly to his blog on pandemic influenza.</p>
<p>The blog is called H5N1, which is the official name for avian flu. These days, his reports more often cite H1N1, the swine flu. If you followed his blog earlier this week, perhaps prompted by his Twitter feed (@crof), you'd have been linked to stories from Spain (832 cases, six “grave”), Brazil (905 cases), Tasmania (first death), and Jamaica (first death). You'd also be able to read a 16-page plan by the American College of Emergency Physicians to cope with this fall's expected surge in cases.</p>
<p>He sent alerts about three deaths in Canada, 231 cases in Thailand, 11 sick students in South Africa, not to mention the Secretary-general of the United Nations calling for a billion-dollar fund to help poor countries fight the infection.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most disconcerting report concerned hospital staff in Argentina (“now the epicentre of the world”) refusing to help treat a three-year-old girl in Entre Rios province.</p>
<p>The blogger seems indefatigable, although recent events are starting to tire him out.</p>
<p>“It has run me ragged the last 10, 12 weeks,” he said. “The news has come in so fast and furious.”</p>
<p>The flubloggia (the cyber community of influenza obsessives) finds redemption of sorts in the cascade of bad news after the anticlimax of the avian-flu scare.</p>
<p>“We knew we were cranks,” Mr. Kilian said. “We were making a huge fuss about, and spending a lot of time on, a non-existent pandemic.”</p>
<p>Mr. Kilian is doing his part in keeping the public informed on H1N1. At 68, he likely has some resistance to the illness, having lived through influenza pandemics in 1957 and 1968.</p>
<p>The flu blog – http://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/ [http://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/] – is one of 16 he maintains. A prolific writer, the retired college instructor has published novels, historical fantasies, a critique of the education system, a thriller set in Antarctica, and a terrific history of pioneering black settlement in British Columbia (Go Do Some Great Thing, reissued last fall in a revised edition by Commodore Books).</p>
<p>Self-Counsel Press will issue his latest book in September, Write Your Non-Fiction Book Online.</p>
<p>He has yet to publish in print what may be his most compelling tale – life as a Red Diaper Baby in the midst of a Red scare.</p>
<p>Born in Manhattan in 1941, he graduated from Columbia University with an English degree, then completed two years as a clerk in the U.S. Army before becoming a technical writer at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley, Calif. In 1966, Mr. Kilian saw on a magazine cover a photograph of the man who drilled him, Master Sergeant Donald Duncan, “one of the coolest guys I'd ever met in the army.” The cover line read, “I quit!” with the tease, “The whole thing was a lie!” The next year, Mr. Kilian abandoned the Bay Area to start a new life in Vancouver. Although he had fulfilled his military obligation, he'd had enough of the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>Mr. Kilian became a college instructor and, 40 years later, retired as the last original hire from what is now Capilano University.</p>
<p>Mr. Kilian is a rare person who can say, “I owe my existence to Hitler.” His parents met at a rally of the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League.</p>
<p>They named their son for a family friend, magazine illustrator Will Crawford. The artist spent time with Mr. Kilian's grandfather at Free Acres, an experimental community in New Jersey whose residents were dismissed as “freakers.” Actor James Cagney, also a family friend, lived there for a time.</p>
<p>Victor Kilian and Mr. Cagney were vaudeville partners, both later moving to films, Mr. Kilian usually as a villain. Family lore has Victor Kilian taking a misplaced punch in the head from John Wayne during the filming of a fight scene for Reap the Wild Wind.</p>
<p>Victor Kilian and his namesake son, an actor and screenwriter, both belonged to the Communist Party, the son once escorting the Canadian doctor Norman Bethune on a fundraising tour of New England in support of the Spanish Republic.</p>
<p>The senior Mr. Kilian was ordered to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. He refused to name names and was blacklisted, as was Victor Kilian Jr., who moved his family to Mexico City.</p>
<p>In Mexico, young Crawford befriended screenwriter Dalton Trumbo. Mr. Trumbo won an Academy Award under an alias before effectively breaking the blacklist by being named the writer for Spartacus in 1960.</p>
<p>Mr. Kilian's relatives' misplaced devotion to the Soviet Union caused untold disruption.</p>
<p>“I thought Communists were a bunch of old farts. Who wanted to hang out with them?”</p>
<p>Mr. Kilian's H5N1 blog averages 1,668 visits per day. Some day soon, the page tally for visitors will hit no. 1,500,000.</p>

<div>VANCOUVER 2010 HEALTH CARE ELECTIVE SURGERY</div>
<div>British Columbia News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Vancouver health authority to delay activity during Games</b>
</div><div>ROD MICKLEBURGH </div>
<div>495 words</div><div>9 July 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>S1</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

 </div>
</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -- Vancouver Coastal Health Authority has joined the criminal judicial system in delaying activity during the 2010 Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>Chief medical health officer Patricia Daly said yesterday that the number of elective operations taking place while the Games go on will be reduced by 30 per cent from their usual level.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, judicial officials announced that most criminal trials in the province would be cancelled for the month of February because so many police officers would be deployed to maintain security at the Olympics and unavailable to testify.</p>
<p>Dr. Daly said the health authority's decision was prompted, in part, by the experience of previous Olympics, where the demand for medical services went down because of transportation and accommodation hassles.</p>
<p>“The public doesn't want their elective surgeries at a time when it's hard to get around and parking is difficult,” she said. “At the same time, people from out of town worry that family members wanting to support them won't be able to find a hotel during the Olympics.”</p>
<p>As well, Dr. Daly said, authority planners wanted to reduce activity to permit staff to attend or volunteer at the Games, and there is a need to maintain extra capacity to handle the huge influx of Olympic visitors.</p>
<p>She likened the reduction in elective surgery to the annual slowdown at Christmas.</p>
<p>“It will affect things like orthopedic stuff, and possibly even elective diagnostic imaging, but oncology procedures will continue as usual, along with all emergency surgery,” Dr. Daly said. “Anyone who needs care will still be able to get it.”</p>
<p>Dr. Daly, who is the executive leader for the health authority's Olympic planning, said there are also concerns over round-the-clock parking restrictions on many city streets during the 2010 Games.</p>
<p>“We have many nurses who provide home care to clients in the community, and they do need to park,” she said.</p>
<p>VANOC, however, has promised to find a solution, while the city has agreed to provide designated parking areas in the heavily serviced Downtown Eastside to accommodate VCHA staff who need to travel there.</p>
<p>On another matter, Dr. Daly said planning is well under way to head off any outbreaks of flu during the Olympics. All of the 25,000 or so volunteers will receive free flu shots from Coastal Health.</p>
<p>VANOC is responsible for its employees' vaccinations,</p>
<p>and all national Olympic committees have been told to inoculate their athletes and officials before they arrive,</p>
<p>she said.</p>
<p>Local public-health officials are also closely monitoring the spread of H1N1 flu and the drive to develop a vaccine for the virus, Dr. Daly added.</p>
<p>“Above all, people shouldn't panic. The Olympics are going to take place no matter what, and we have already had two Olympic Games, in 1968, take place during a flu outbreak. It's manageable.”</p>

</p>
<p>Health authorities in Canada and the United States are on high alert for Internet scams related to swine flu and are cracking down on websites selling unauthorized products and making illegal claims about how to prevent and treat the illness.</p>
<p>Health Canada and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration are tracking the websites and have issued dozens of warning letters to force the removal of offensive claims.</p>
<p>Among the products that have popped up online are: a pill that purports to cure a swine-flu infection within hours;a spray that claims to leave a layer of ionic silver on the skin that would kill the virus; fake test kits; a shampoo; nasal sprays; wall-mounted ultraviolet light machines that allegedly prevent the spread and destroy the virus; and an electronic instrument that declares its "photobionic energy" and "deeply penetrating mega-frequency life-force energy waves" would strengthen the immune system and prevent infection. The machine costs thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Attaching a claim to an unapproved product is illegal and authorities are not taking it lightly.</p>
<p>"We consider the marketing of unproven products to treat a serious contagious disease like swine flu to be a very serious threat to the public's health," said Gary Coody, the FDA's health fraud co-ordinator. "It not only offers people a false sense of protection, but it may prevent people from immediately seeking a proven treatment."</p>
<p>The swine flu virus, also known as H1N1, has infected more than 94,000 people worldwide--more than 8,800 in Canada--and while there is still much that is unknown about the virus, two antiviral drugs called Tamiflu and Relenza have so far proven effective in treating it in many cases.</p>

</p>
<p>There were no close hugs, no final kisses, just loving goodbyes from a family now mourning one of the latest Canadian victims who died from the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Perry Chernesky, an otherwise healthy 42-year-old man known for his rosy cheeks and an ability to quote scripture and Bugs Bunny, died on Sunday in isolation in a Winnipeg hospital after falling sick Father's Day. He will be buried Saturday in Edmonton.</p>
<p>"The most difficult thing about H1N1 is when you see your loved one suffering and you are wearing a gown and gloves, and you're wearing a mask and face shield, and you can't touch them," said his wife, Claudia Chernesky.</p>
<p>"You can't be near them. You try to tell them that you love them but they're sedated."</p>
<p>Claudia spoke of her grief to Liza Yuzda, a relative who lives in Edmonton and is speaking on behalf of the family. Yuzda recorded her conversation with Claudia, who urged people to not live in fear of the new flu strain, even when they hear the story of her husband, who was one of the first healthy people in Canada to succumb to the illness.</p>
<p>"Yes, my husband was young and yes he was healthy, but he's (part of) a very small minority who gets very deathly ill," Claudia said from her home in Oakbank, Man., where she and her two daughters are finding comfort in family and church friends.</p>
<p>"My daughters, myself, we were all exposed to H1N1 before we knew he was diagnosed with it and we didn't have any respiratory ailments, any problems, none of us were sick. We were fine. We continue to be fine throughout the whole treatment."</p>
<p>The family thought he had the regular flu, but when his cough became severe he was admitted to Concordia Hospital in Winnipeg. A few days later, Perry was put on a ventilator and his parents flew there from Edmonton to be close.</p>
<p>Perry's kidneys failed. He was put on dialysis and transferred to Winnipeg's Health Sciences Centre where he died of a heart attack.</p>
<p>"It was unfortunate and it took his life very quickly," Claudia said. "I would just like to tell everybody not to fear or to panic but just to keep up good hygiene practices."</p>
<p>She said she and her daughters, ages 13 and seven, breathed the same air as Perry and took no extra precautions before he went to hospital. Perry had performed a weekend wedding and led a Sunday worship service before being admitted. He came into contact with many people, as is usual as a pastor.</p>
<p>"Nobody was affected by it," Claudia said. "Nobody else went to hospital."</p>
<p>Perry grew up and studied in Edmonton. He moved to Manitoba to be pastor in a village just east of Winnipeg.</p>
<p>A graduate of the Edmonton Baptist Seminary, Perry has worked for several years at Oakbank Baptist Church.</p>
<p>In a public memorial page on the Internet, friends and church members spoke of Perry's generosity, easy encouragement and constant smile.</p>
<p>"Perry was a one-in-a-million man," wrote one person. "His love for his family and his love for Jesus was shown daily in all that he did. He knew how to love people, and was a wonderful friend."</p>
<p>Pastor Lee Bertsch, who will be helping officiate Perry's funeral at Zion Baptist Community Church in Edmonton this weekend, said he will remember Perry for his hearty laugh. Bertsch worked with Perry for two years at the church before Perry moved to Manitoba. Perry served as the youth minister, played guitar with the young people and took them on mission trips.</p>
<p>"This was more than a job for him," Bertsch said. "This was in his heart."</p>

<p>FARMERS RALLYING IN CALGARY</p>
<p>EDMONTON -Alberta's pork producers will hold what they call an industrial crisis rally in Calgary on Friday to publicize their plight to governments and the public.</p>
<p>They've asked provincial Agriculture and Rural Development Minister George Groeneveld's office report back at the rally after he takes part today in a meeting of federal and provincial ministers in Ontario.</p>
<p>"We have asked (Groeneveld) to take the issue of financial support for the pork industry to the meeting," Alberta Pork executive director Paul Hodgman said.</p>
<p>Pork producers have endured three years of losses due to a high Canadian dollar and skyrocketing feed grain prices, he said.</p>
<p>Hopes of returning to profitability this spring were wiped out by the H1N1 influenza outbreak, he added.</p>
<p>The rally will be held at McDougall Centre in downtown Calgary from 11:30 a. m. to 1:30 p. m.</p>
<p>SAFETY CERTIFIER EXPANDS</p>
<p>EDMONTON -The CSA Group, whose main facility for hazardous-locations safety testing is in Edmonton, has acquired U. K.-based SIRA Test and Certification Ltd. for about $15 million.</p>
<p>SIRA specializes in testing safety equipment used in potentially explosive atmospheres.</p>
<p>"The decision to acquire the four SIRA companies is in alignment with CSA Group's strategic objective to be among the world's largest safety certifiers, and is a component of CSA International's business strategy to focus on hazardous locations testing," said Robert Griffin, CEO of Toronto-based CSA Group.</p>
<p>SIRA will operate as a business division of CSA International and the SIRA brand will be retained, Griffin said.</p>
<p>CHRETIEN AN ADVISER TO MINER</p>
<p>MONTREAL -Former prime minister Jean Chretien, now a private-sector lawyer, was named Wednesday as senior international adviser to Vancouver's Ivanhoe Mines Inc., which is developing the massive Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine in Mongolia.</p>
<p>Also, Ivanhoe confirmed that an investment agreement between the company and the government of Mongolia has received approval from the caucuses of the country's two major political parties.</p>
<p>The Mongolian mine has languished in uncertainty for several years because of changing ownership and other demands by successive Mongolian governments. Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been spent on the project.</p>
<p>SCOTIA DISCOUNTS HOCKEY GEAR</p>
<p>TORONTO -<span class="companylink">Bank of Nova Scotia</span> has reached an agreement with Pro Hockey Life Sporting Goods Inc. to offer discounts on hockey equipment in an effort to add new clients in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<p>Starting Aug. 14, shoppers will get 10 per cent off on hockey supplies and other merchandise when they show a Scotiabank credit or debit card, said John Doig, the bank's senior vice-president of marketing.</p>
<p>The agreement is the latest step in Scotiabank's strategy to link its brand to Canada's favourite sport. The Toronto-based bank, Canada's third-largest, owns the naming rights to the Ottawa Senators' arena, Scotiabank Place, and sponsors the National Hockey League, the NHL Players' Association, and the pre-game show on CBC's Hockey Night in Canada.</p>
<p>DEAL ON TRACK, VITERRA SAYS</p>
<p>REGINA -Canadian grain-handling company <span class="companylink">Viterra Inc</span>. said its acquisition of ABB Grains Ltd. remains on track a day after the Australian company cut its profit view, hurt by lower demand.</p>
<p>"Our offer was not based on one year of earnings, but rather the long-term cycle of earnings beginning in 2010 and beyond. The strategic rationale remains compelling," Viterra CEO Mayo Schmidt said in a statement.</p>
<p>Crop prospects in South Australia have been supported by good rainfall and growing conditions, and Viterra remains committed to its acquisition of ABB, the Reginabased company said.</p>
<p>ABB had lowered its annual profit outlook, citing slower demand for malt by Asian customers and weaker sales of fertilizer and agriculture chemicals.</p>
<p>FDA WANTS MASK DETAILS</p>
<p>MONTREAL -<span class="companylink">Noveko International Inc</span>., the Montreal-based firm commercializing antimicrobial filter technology worldwide, said Wednesday it has until Oct. 23 to file extra data on its surgical masks with U. S. regulators.</p>
<p>Alain Bolduc, Noveko's chief operating officer, said no antibacterial surgical mask products have yet received regulatory clearance for the U. S. market, and it believes its product will become "first mover."</p>
<p>The new information on its product will be contained in a submission to the Federal Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>GOOGLE TAKES ON MICROSOFT</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO -<span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>., owner of the most-visited Internet search engine, is developing a computer operating system based on its Chrome web browser, taking aim at <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>. in its strongest market.</p>
<p>The system will be designed at first for low-cost laptops, Mountain View, Calif.-based <span class="companylink">Google</span> said in a blog post. The company is in talks with partners on the project, and computers running the software will be available in the second half of 2010.</p>
<p>The plan escalates <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s rivalry with <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, which extends to web search, browsers and business applications such as word processing and spreadsheets.</p>
<p>CHINA HOLDS RIO EXEC AS SPY</p>
<p>BEIJING -Chinese authorities are detaining <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto Ltd</span>.'s top iron ore negotiator on suspicion of espionage and stealing state secrets, Australia said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Details about the detention of Stern Hu and three other Rio employees, emerged as a Shanghai newspaper reported that Chinese steel mills have finally given in on annual iron ore prices, conceding to a 33-per-cent cut for six months, although both <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span> and Chinese executives said talks continue.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether there was any tie between the two, but the detention follows a period of tense relations between the two vast trading partners, with iron ore negotiations running past the June 30 deadline and Rio snubbing a planned $19.5-billion-US investment by state-owned Chinalco last month.</p>
<p>U.S. MORTGAGE APPS UP</p>
<p>WASHINGTON -Mortgage applications in the U. S. rose last week as refinancing jumped by the most since March, and purchases climbed to the highest level in three months.</p>
<p>The Mortgage Bankers Association's index of applications to purchase a home or refinance a loan increased 11 per cent to 493.1 in the week ended July 3, up from 444.8 in the prior week.</p>
<p>The group's refinancing gauge surged 15 per cent, while the index of purchases gained 6.7 per cent.</p>
<p>Falling prices, driven by foreclosures, have brought more homes within reach of buyers who qualify for credit, helping to stabilize demand. At the same time, unemployment is rising and borrowing costs are edging back up, indicating any rebound for the housing industry will be slow to take hold.</p>
<p>CONSUMER CREDIT FALLS AGAIN</p>
<p>WASHINGTON -Borrowing by U. S. consumers dropped in May for the fourth straight month after the unemployment rate reached the highest in more than 25 years and accessing loans remained difficult.</p>
<p>Consumer credit fell $3.23 billion US, or 1.54 per cent at an annual rate, to $2.52 trillion US, according to a Federal Reserve report released Wednesday.</p>
<p>Economists had forecast consumer credit would drop $8.8 billion US in May.</p>
<p>PEPSI DEAL 'NOT CRITICAL'</p>
<p>MOSCOW -<span class="companylink">PepsiCo Inc</span>.'s proposed takeover of its two largest bottlers isn't key to the soft-drink company's operations, said CEO Indra Nooyi.</p>
<p>"If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen," Nooyi said Wednesday in an interview at the opening of a Pepsi bottling plant in Moscow. "Consolidating the bottlers into <span class="companylink">PepsiCo</span> is not critical for day-to-day operations."</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Pepsi Bottling Group Inc</span>., based in Somers, N. Y., and <span class="companylink">PepsiAmericas Inc</span>., based in Minneapolis, both rejected <span class="companylink">PepsiCo</span>'s April proposal, saying the offer of about $6 billion US in cash and stock for the two distributors was too low.</p>
<p>Nooyi has said a consolidation would create opportunities for growth.</p>

<p>MICRO-MANAGING HER IMAGE</p>
<p>Solange Knowles hates the way she looks when she sings. The 23-year-old singer, sister of Halo star Beyoncé, stopped halfway through her performance at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans last weekend and demanded a paparazzo stop taking photos of her.</p>
<p>"Mr. Photographer, you are making me self-conscious. I swear I make the same stupid three faces over and over again, so please leave me be," Solange shouted. She has been camera shy since she collapsed at an airport in February after accidentally overdosing on cough medicine during a flight.</p>
<p>Brief</p>
<p>Photo: SERIOUS, SERIOUS INK Lady Gaga is "flattered" fans choose to have tattoos of her. The Poker Face singer -- who is known for her outrageous fashion choices and skimpy outfits -- is delighted many of her admirers are prepared to permanently ink their skin to show their devotion to her. She said: "This fan got this amazing tattoo on his arm, this massive Lady Gaga tattoo that was very intricate and very detailed, and in it I was wearing this crystal outfit -- but this thing was like an art piece. I was so flattered because tattoos are for life." Lady Gaga is confident she is one of only a handful of stars whose fans are prepared to put themselves through physical pain.; Photo: VOLDEMORT STRIKES AGAIN RUPERT GRINT thought he was going to die from swine flu. The Harry Potter actor -- who plays Ron Weasley in the hit wizard film franchise -- panicked when doctors confirmed he had the highly contagious illness, which has caused several fatalities around the globe in recent weeks. "It was quite scary when I first found out I had swine flu. I thought, 'Am I going to die?' But it was just like any other flu, really. I had a sore throat and I went to bed for a few days." However, the British actor seemingly felt better as he greeted fans at the U.K. première of the sixth film, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in London's Leicester Square. Last week, it was revealed the 20-year-old star had been forced to take time off from filming Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- the final big-screen adaptation of the J.K. Rowling novels -- when he contracted the illness. His publicist said: "Other scenes were shot in his absence, which did not require his involvement, and this filming was not disrupted." The publicist also confirmed Grint is back in good health and is no longer contagious or at risk of infecting others.; Photo: FIT FOR WHAT? Gene Simmons says wearing high heels keeps him fit. The Kiss bassist claims he never gains weight, despite gorging on cakes and other sweet treats, because performing in his huge leather stage costume and stacked shoes helps him burn off excess calories. "When you train your body to walk on these platform heels for hours and carry 30 pounds of guitar and leather outfits, it's a terrific workout," he said. "You can eat cheesecake every day and not gain a pound."; Photo: AUSTRIAN DECLARES WAR ON BRUNO Sacha Baron Cohen's film Bruno has been blasted by a top Austrian envoy. Emil Brix, who has been named ambassador to Britain, has called for a boycott because of the "cheap" jokes in the controversial film, which follows Cohen as the eponymous gay Austrian fashionista trying to become a celebrity in the United States. During the film, Bruno jokes he wants to become the most famous Austrian "since Hitler." Brix, who takes up his post next year, said: "It's totally inappropriate. Everybody should speak up against that." Brix also claimed Cohen, who is British, is only controversial to "create as much interest as possible for his film." The ambassador also bizarrely suggested that directors such as Michael Haneke portray Austrian life much more accurately, although Haneke's most famous film, Funny Games, is about a pair of killers who hold a family hostage and torture them seemingly without motive or emotion.; Photo: CRUZ COPES WITH CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE Penelope Cruz always expects to be "fired" when starring in a film. The 35-year-old actress -- who won this year's Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as Maria Elena in Vicky Cristina Barcelona -- admits she lacks confidence in her abilities as an actress. She told Britain's Psychologies magazine: "Every time I make a film, I feel like it's my first time. I always think they could fire me. "I've ruined my own happiness and created problems with my friends because of this tendency. It takes discipline for me to stop worrying."; Photo: PEAS SAY IT'S NOT SO The Black Eyed Peas are reportedly being sued for plagiarism. The Boom Boom Pow hitmakers are apparently facing legal action over their track Party All the Time, featured on their latest album The E.N.D., because parts of the record have an uncanny resemblance to Adam Freeland's record Mancry. The band has reportedly called in their legal team over the plagiarism accusation.; Photo: WAY MORE THAN FRIENDS Courteney Cox insists her marriage has never been better. The former Friends actress, who has been plagued by constant rumours her 10-year union to David Arquette is in trouble, says she is enjoying every aspect of her life and never imagined she could be so happy. Cox, who has a five-year-old daughter Coco with Arquette, said: "I can honestly say that I have the best marriage, the best husband and the best daughter. They are the things that have given me real happiness -- so much more than anything else. I don't think I ever thought I would end up as happy as I am today."; Photo: MISCHIEF MANAGED Harry Potter star Jamie Waylett has been charged with growing cannabis. The 19-year-old actor -- who plays Hogwarts bully Vincent Crabbe in the hit wizard films -- has been accused of growing 10 plants in his mother's house in North London. Waylett, who will appear in court later this month, was arrested in April after police stopped his car in London and allegedly found eight bags of grass.; Photo: IT WAS LEDGER'S LIFE TO LOSE Heath Ledger's father blames his son for his own death. Racing car driver Kim Ledger believes the late Brokeback Mountain star -- who died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs in January 2008, aged just 28 -- is accountable for his own passing because he was not carefully monitoring his medication. "We're all responsible for what goes into us and I blame Heath for not being responsible." At the time of his death, it is believed the actor was mixing medication prescribed to him by three different doctors.; Photo: MERYL, AMY LIVING LARGE Meryl Streep and Amy Adams piled on the pounds while shooting Julie and Julia. The 'Doubt' co-stars reunited for the forthcoming film -- which is about world-famous chef Julia Child and writer Julie Powell, who challenged herself to cook Julia's recipes -- and admit the amount of food they had to eat for their roles wasn't good for their waistlines. "I gained 15 pounds," said Streep. "I'm still trying to lose it! It was worth it." Adams added: "I ate a lot! Cooking is like love -- it should be approached with abandon." Photo   </p>

<p>WINNIPEG</p>
<p>Health officials in Manitoba are reporting the death of an adult who had tested positive for swine flu. It is the sixth death in the province related to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Officials say the person was between 18 and 65 years old and had underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>The province is also confirming 102 new confirmed flu cases in the last week, bringing the total to 787. Many of the stricken have been from northern aboriginal communities.</p>

<p>Name game time</p>
<p>From mentalfloss.com, other finalists for this team's nickname were the Heat, the Juice and the Tropics. Can you guess what was chosen? (Answer below).</p>
<p>Pedro not done yet</p>
<p>If you thought former Expo Pedro Martinez was done after he didn't get an offer to his liking this winter, think again. According to ESPN.com, Philadelphia Phillies executives were in the Dominican Republic on Tuesday to watch Martinez throw a simulated game. A source told the website the Phillies are willing to pay him for the rest of the season, but not as much as he was asking. "The decision to sign him depends on the front office, but as far as we are concerned, we saw a Pedro Martinez ready to help a team," Phillies scout Robinson Garcia told ESPN.com's Spanish-language arm. He thinks Martinez, 37, can hit 93 mph with his fastball, which ranged between 88-91 mph Tuesday.</p>
<p>Fat Vlad hurt again</p>
<p>The behemoth that is former Expo Vladimir Guerrero is on the shelf - again. It was only his second game in right field for the L.A. Angels, after being relegated to DH, and missing 35 games with a torn pectoral muscle. He strained a muscle behind his left knee fielding a single. You wonder why they even bother putting the big man out there, since they need his bat so badly. Guerrero hit only his third and fourth homers of the season July 4 and 5. He has seven walks in nearly 200 plate appearances, which tells you he's wildly flailing away to find that missing power stroke.</p>
<p>Vlad's still the man</p>
<p>Former Expos manager Felipe Alou, in town last week, spent all of spring training in Arizona. But he didn't see big, bad Vlad once; his protégé, 34, had surgery on his right knee last October and didn't play at all until late in the Cactus League season. "He's big, but he can still hit," Alou said. Guerrero is still listed on the ESPN website at 235 pounds; we're betting he's added 40 big ones, from what we've seen recently. Tough on the joints. Guerrero is without a contract for next year, on top of all that.</p>
<p>Swine flu hits</p>
<p>A top swimmer had to withdraw from the U.S. national championships Tuesday. Kate Ziegler, 21, the reigning world champion in the 800-metre freestyle, never even made it to the meet. Ziegler trains in Virginia, where four male teammates were recently ill with swine flu. Her diagnosis was "some version of the flu," according to the Washington Post. At the World University Games in Belgrade, Serbia, two students (one Australian, another from Uganda), tested positive for swine flu and have been quarantined. More than 7,000 students from 142 countries are competing there.</p>
<p>Donde està Bartolo?</p>
<p>The Chicago White Sox are waiting for pitcher Bartolo Colon to return from a left-knee injury, and he has a minor-league rehab start scheduled for today at Triple-A. The problem is, he's AWOL. "Efforts to contact his agent have been successful. Their efforts to contact their client have not been so successful," White Sox GM Ken Williams said Tuesday. A suggestion: check the nearest all-you-can-eat joint.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Spurning Hollywood's advances; 'My love is for acting, not money,' says Mexican star Gael Garcia Bernal;</b>
</div><div>Alastair Smart   </div>
<div>Sunday Telegraph</div>
<div>1342 words</div><div>9 July 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>D4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>No rumble of traffic, no cries from tamale sellers, not even the patter of footsteps. The dawn cacophony had missed its cue and the 20 million Chilangos were staying at home: Mexico City had gone post-apocalyptic. Schools, factories, restaurants, offices--all were shut down. Even Sunday masses were cancelled, at a time when this staunchly Catholic city perhaps most needed communion with the divine.</p>
<p>In late April, Gael Garcia Bernal was all set to fly to New York for the Tribeca Film Festival, where his latest movie Rudo& Cursi was to get its U. S. premiere, but the outbreak of swine flu meant that he, like everyone else in a metastasizing Mexico City, was fearfully holed up at home. "At first, it was terrifying, man," the actor recalls. "I don't understand epidemics, who does? Paranoia and panic spread through the city incredibly fast. I was just watching news reports of all these people dying and not having any idea when this thing outside my door would end."</p>
<p>Garcia Bernal ultimately did make it to Tribeca, but for an actor who has consistently spurned the advances of Hollywood to make movies in Mexico, it seems entirely yet tragically apt that he should spend the darkest days of swine flu among his countrymen. The gringos could wait.</p>
<p>Politically outspoken</p>
<p>Ever since bursting on to the scene in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's gritty urban drama Amores Perros in 2001, Garcia Bernal has carved out a reputation as one of the mildest-mannered guys in film. Except, that is, where politics is concerned. At 16, he joined marches and demonstrations supporting the rebellion of the Zapatista Indians in Chiapas. At 24, more famously, when presenting an award at the 2003 Oscars, he gave the night's first denunciation of the Iraq War.</p>
<p>Today, he's just as politically outspoken about swine flu: With a couple of months' hindsight, Garcia Bernal has actually come to see the epidemic as a positive. "It gave the people of Mexico City time for introspection, for once, which was liberating. Normally the city is caught up in a western way of operating, which forces you to work all the time, and sacrifice any time you might spend with your family and friends. Those enforced days indoors gave society the chance to reflect on the way we've all come to live our lives."</p>
<p>Such anti-capitalist sentiment would have been worthy of Che Guevara himself, the guerrillero icon who provided Garcia Bernal with his most famous role to date. In 2004's The Motorcycle Diaries, the actor played a young, pre-revolutionary Guevara as he embarked on a coming-of-age motorbike journey across South America in 1952. Garcia Bernal played the part beautifully, depicting Guevara's dawning political conscience in gentle but telling strokes, as he stumbled upon one social injustice after another.</p>
<p>The film premiered at Cannes in 2004--alongside Pedro Almodovar's Bad Education, in which Garcia Bernal starred as a vengeful drag queen--and on the back of these two hits, the Mexican actor was suddenly cinema's hottest property. Lucrative Hollywood offers came thick and fast, but Garcia Bernal has refused every one. Why?</p>
<p>"I've never cared for the idea of a career path, or where a film might 'take me.' My love is for acting, not money, so I only take on roles that I find challenging, in stories I find interesting. I was brought up the Mexican way, where actors are paid very little and every part you take is an act of faith. If people respect that, then great." And respect it, they do.</p>
<p>Good looks</p>
<p>The boyish good looks have helped, of course: the doe eyes, sculpted cheekbones and lupine smile--not to mention his compact body--have made swooning females everywhere sudden converts to Mexican cinema. Previous squeezes include Natalie Portman and Keira Knightley, who admits to "going all giggly-teenagery" over how handsome he was.</p>
<p>Yet Garcia Bernal has always been as much throwback as heartthrob. An art-house pin-up a la Jean-Paul Belmondo and Marcello Mastroianni, he's achieved acclaim the world over yet still preserved a conspicuous connection to his homeland--so killer is his gaze, he all but makes the subtitles redundant.</p>
<p>In London this week to promote his latest film Rudo&Cursi, Garcia Bernal hasn't fussed too much over his appearance: he sports an over-worn Sex Pistols T-shirt and an underwashed pair of denim jeans.</p>
<p>Yet what strikes you most is the sense of warmth and vulnerability about him--two qualities that have helped him make the frequently unsavoury film characters he plays really rather likable.</p>
<p>Rudo&Cursi reunites Garcia Bernal with his old mucker and best mate Diego Luna. The two were child stars together in an early-'90s telenovela, before co-starring in 2001's marvellous road movie Y Tu Mama Tambien. This time out they play feuding brothers who are whisked away from their jobs at a backwoods banana plantation to become soccer stars in Mexico City. The lads are ill-equipped to cope with the fame and fortune that come their way--Luna's character Rudo is distracted by gambling and cocaine, Garcia Bernal's Cursi by four-by-fours, a vapid television hostess and dreams of pop stardom. The whole film serves as a satirical swipe at celebrity obsession, which, according to Garcia Bernal, has come to hold modern Mexico lamentably in thrall. "We live in an age of spectacle, where celebrity has become a synonym for success. But, like capitalism, celebrity is another poisonous western idea that has spread itself through our society."</p>
<p>Garcia Bernal, 30, and his longtime partner, Argentine actress Dolores Fonzi, have just had their first child together.</p>
<p>At age 18, having turned his back on telenovelas, he was curiously found mixing cement and lugging bricks around a building site. He had decamped to London, with no plan other than to "get lost in Europe for a while," but soon caught the acting bug again and enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama, working part time as a labourer.</p>
<p>It was while studying at Central in 1999 that Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu called to ask him if he'd come home and star in Amores Perros. "But it was mid-term, and I wasn't allowed to miss any school," says Garcia Bernal, smirking mischievously. "So Alejandro arranged to send over a medical certificate saying I needed to return home urgently because I had caught a tropical disease the last time I was in Mexico."</p>
<p>On the back of Amores Perros and then Y Tu Mama Tambien, Mexico's biggest-grossing film ever, Mexican cinema was suddenly on the rise again, and in Garcia Bernal had its biggest star since Pedro Infante. After decades in the doldrums, there was even talk of another Golden Age to match that of the '40s. Determined that this renaissance should be no flash in the pan, in 2003 Garcia Bernal and Luna set up Canana Films, a production company aimed at telling socially minded stories and "documenting what's truly happening in Mexico today."</p>
<p>After modest beginnings, Canana is now responsible for 15 releases a year and has struck a deal with Universal Studios' art-house arm Focus Features for international distribution.</p>
<p>"I don't say this to blow my own trumpet, but Canana serves a strong and unique function in Mexico. It produces films by people with something to say, and never for business reasons. And this gives me more than any paycheque ever could."</p>
<p>Take that, Hollywood.</p>

<p>Re:H1N1 flu cases top 1,000; Second Alberta woman dies after contracting virus," The Journal, July 7.</p>
<p>The problem with making statements about what is the most important, the longest, the fastest, the strongest, etc., is what is excluded by that statement.</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Joffe is quoted as saying, "I personally think this could become the major health-care challenge of the last 40 years." The 1968 Hong Kong flu strain killed one million people worldwide.</p>
<p>Given that Joffe specializes in infectious diseases, I wonder where he would place HIV on his importance scale. According to the latest WHO statistics issued in July 2008, by of the end of 2007 more than 25 million people had died from AIDS since it was first identified in 1981 and about 33 million more people are living with HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>Im not saying that H1N1 should not get a lot of attention, just that it should not take all our attention and resources away from a number of other problems, including HIV.</p>

</p>
<p>Formula One racing driver Jenson Button, interviewed in GQ mag, sheds some light on the March incident in which he had to warn his boss, Sir Richard Branson, to stop hitting on his lingerie-model girlfriend Jessica Michibata. This happened at a party to celebrate Branson's deal to sponsor Button's race team.</p>
<p>When the GQ interviewer first asked, Button downplayed the incident: "I wouldn't possibly be able to say. It's amazing when they write things in newspapers like that - just trying to make it all sound as exciting as possible."</p>
<p>But under persistent questioning he conceded that although "there was no touching involved" he did have to intervene between Branson and the girl. And the tycoon later apologized, and "won't be doing it again," Button added. A spokesman told the Daily Mail, which reported the magazine interview, that Branson, who is married, "has no memory of anything happening" - a phrase which makes me think strong drink may have been a factor.</p>

<p>Rupert Grint, the Harry-Potter-movies actor, says he's feeling fine now, and is fully recovered from his swine flu, and doesn't quite see what the big deal is:</p>

<p>Just take the test: Keanu Reeves is asking an Ontario court to throw out a claim against him from one Karen Sala, who says her four children, now in their 20s, are also his. She wants $3 million a month in spousal support, back-dated to 2006, plus $150,000 is child support, back-dated to 1988. The actor's mouthpiece says "his position is that he's not the father of these children, never had a relationship with them, never lived with Ms. Sala, and that the application has absolutely no merits. It's totally frivolous."</p>
<p>She says they've known each other since they were kids. He says, approximately, "who is she?" The stories I've seen don't explain why she waited this long to go to court, except that she claims to have been trying for years to get some money out of him "privately." Now she wants Reeves and the kids to be DNA-tested.</p>
<p>The two sides will meet a family court judge Aug. 11.</p>
<p>She's 46. Keanu is 44.</p>

<p>Coltish starlet Mischa Barton seems to have gained a couple of pounds, so there's speculation that something's wrong. Really, a girl can't win: too skinny, you're messed up. Get less skinny, you're messed up. Get fat, you're really messed up.</p>
<p>Closer, a British celeb mag, claims that un-named friends of Mischa's are saying she's had an unhappy love-life lately and is trying to drink her troubles away. And "drinking bloats her terribly," says one alleged friend. "After clubbing she'll usually tuck into greasy fast food. She'll starve herself all day then binge on junk. It wreaks havoc with her system."</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health announced there were a total of 18 cases of the H1N1 flu in its coverage area as of last Friday, the latest figures available.</p>
<p>That's three more confirmed cases than previously reported on June 30, communications manager Jan Craig said yesterday.</p>
<p>Since provincial Ministry of Health reporting practises were refined recently, health units no longer routinely report in which specific communities these cases originated.</p>
<p>That's because H1N1 has established itself in Ontario, so its presence is no longer considered rare, she explained.</p>
<p>"It is just out and widespread," Craig said. "There's H1N1 in the community."</p>
<p>What she could provide is the ages of the three people who contracted the illness most recently in the region.</p>
<p>They are 14, 44 and 52 years old.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the number of lab-confirmed cases of H1N1 in Waterloo Region was pegged at 26.</p>
<p>Five people have been hospitalized.</p>
<p>No one had died from H1N1 in Waterloo Region.</p>
<p>Some of the cases have hit younger adults.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>MD warns of autumn spike in swine flu; Scientists at Toronto conference say hospitals must prepare now for increase in severe cases</b>

</p>
<p>As the H1N1 pandemic virus continues to sweep the world, showing few signs of abatement, more than 200 Canadian scientists gathered yesterday in Toronto to develop new strategies to combat the disease.</p>
<p>A top priority is to find out why some people with the virus get a severe illness that requires intensive hospital care and can lead to death, while others only suffer mild flu-like symptoms, said Dr. Frank Plummer, scientific director general of the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>"I don't think we have a good handle on that yet," Plummer told the scientists attending the one-day H1N1 conference.</p>
<p>Dr. Anand Kumar, a physician in critical care and infectious diseases at the Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg, warned intensive care units across the country should prepare for a possible spike in severe cases this fall by preparing for increased bed, nursing, medication and ventilator capacity.</p>
<p>Since the virus was identified in April, some 600 Canadians have been severely affected by the novel influenza. About 35 have died. In total, 9,000 cases of H1N1 have been reported in Canada, but Plummer estimates that, since only a fraction of people get tested, more than 100,000 Canadians have had the virus.</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, there are 95,500 confirmed cases of H1N1 and 435 confirmed deaths around the globe. Plummer said there are likely "hundreds and hundreds of thousands of cases" worldwide.</p>
<p>In Canada, severe cases make up about 1 per cent of all known H1N1 cases. But Plummer said any increase in severe cases will put pressure on intensive care units.</p>
<p>Plummer cited reports from countries in the southern hemisphere, particularly Argentina and Chile, where a surge in H1N1 cases during winter flu season has strained intensive care resources.</p>
<p>"It is at a point in those countries where their acute care systems are beginning to be severely stressed, if they haven't already been overwhelmed," he said.</p>
<p>Kumar is leading a Canada-wide study of H1N1 patients who have been hospitalized with severe illness. His team hopes to figure out why these patients, often young, relatively healthy individuals, are the most vulnerable to the infection.</p>
<p>"In medical ICUs, you're not used to seeing rows and rows of young, relatively healthy ventilated patients," Kumar said. "These patients are incredibly ill and very difficult to manage and you know a good percentage of them will die."</p>
<p>"There are all sorts of very important clinical questions that have to be answered right away in order to give patients the best possible care and to determine which groups are at highest risk of severe disease," Kumar told the Star. "For example, we need to know: How long does a virus persist? How long is a person infectious? And does it depend on whether they get early or late (antiviral) therapy?"</p>
<p>The Winnipeg hospital system was hit hard by a wave of H1N1 influenza last month. At the peak, Kumar said 45 of the system's 70 ICU beds were occupied by H1N1 patients.</p>
<p>Other issues discussed at the conference, hosted by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, included H1N1 vaccine development, ethical issues that arise during an outbreak, and how the virus affects Aboriginal populations.</p>

<p>Some of it is just plain silly. Some of it is bizarre. But a lot of it's pretty darned useful.</p>
<p>Twitter, the social networking site that's used by the likes of Shaquille O'Neal to President Barack Obama, is also a solid travel tool.</p>
<p>Twitter is a site where people sign up to send instant messages of up to 140 characters called "tweets." Some use it for breathless inanities like, "It's hot ... should I go for ice cream or a cold beer?" But travellers and travel companies are putting it to good use.</p>
<p>In a recent San Francisco Chronicle story, Spud Hilton noted that tweets typically fall into three categories: news, deals and advice.</p>
<p>News could be updates on swine flu or an advisory that the booking computers are down at <span class="companylink">United Airlines</span>, which was a tweet I spotted a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>Fairmont Hotels is active on Twitter and sends out regular updates. West Jet had a Twitter contest the other day for free airline tickets.</p>
<p>Toronto-based travel writer Evelyn Hannon, who edits journeywoman.com and has a Twitter account under that name, uses Twitter to give advice to women travellers.</p>
<p>"I might send something like, 'Seek out women born & raised where you plan 2 travel. They're great guides 2 behaviour & dress in that country,'" she says.</p>
<p>Complaints are also a big hit on Twitter. Hilton reported that a Twitter user on a <span class="companylink">Virgin America</span> flight sent off an irate tweet after missing his on-board meal. Airline officials spotted his post and called the cockpit to have flight attendants serve him his food.</p>
<p>Michelle Higgins, writing in the New York Times, told the story of Tony Wagner of Washington, D.C., who tweeted about not being able to sit with his wife and 2-year-old daughter on a Jet Blue flight to San Francisco. He wasn't happy with how it was being handled at the airport so he sent a note to Jet Blue. They responded in less than 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Higgins also told the story of a fellow from Colorado who twittered about his plans for watching the Final Four college basketball championship at a hotel near Denver.</p>
<p>Hotel workers noticed his tweet and gave him a reserved table "with a good view of the TV and offered a free round of beers."</p>

</div><div>By Carol Sanders </div>

</p>
<p>A funeral is being held this week for a vital, vibrant Baptist minister felled by the flu.</p>
<p>Rev. Perry Chernesky, 42, is believed to be the fifth Manitoban with a confirmed case of the H1N1 virus to die. His service is Thursday at 10:30 a.m. at Oakbank Baptist Church.</p>
<p>The swift passing of the much-loved husband and active father has people asking how can the H1N1 flu virus kill someone who is relatively young and healthy?</p>
<p>"Very quickly," said Dr. Anand Kumar at the Health Sciences Centre intensive care unit. "It's not really known how."</p>
<p>A Manitoba child and a Winnipeg man in his 40s who had no known significant underlying health conditions also succumbed to the illness in June.</p>
<p>Kumar can't talk about individual patients but said doctors are trying to unravel the mystery of the H1N1 virus on the fly.</p>
<p>"We're seeing four different syndromes among people who are critically ill," he said. In severe cases, people's lungs can't work and they need to have tubes stuck down their throats connecting them to ventilators, or breathing machines.</p>
<p>In one group, it's the older, debilitated person who may have some degrees of organ failure like renal failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which makes it hard to breathe. The flu can tip them over the line and into needing life support. He said there are five or 10 per cent of severe flu cases in this category, and the ones who get better usually are off the breathing machines within a few days.</p>
<p>In the second group are people with asthma or bronchospastic COPD. The flu can give them an "extremely bad asthma flare-up," said Kumar. "They may end up in the ICU requiring ventilation for several weeks."</p>
<p>In the third group are toddlers and preschoolers who get bronchitis or croup and don't require ICU care.</p>
<p>The fourth "signature" type of H1N1 infection results in a "white out" of the lungs as they fill up with fluids, said Kumar.</p>
<p>"They drown in their own fluids." He said 80 per cent of these cases in which people are so "incredibly ill" they are, for the most part, young and healthy. They may have hypertension or be smokers or pregnant, but they're relatively young.</p>
<p>Kumar said there are different theories about how it is they get so sick so fast.</p>
<p>"Some have suggested people have such a robust response to the virus" it results in a cytokine storm of inflammatory hormones, which causes a lot of damage.</p>
<p>"My own feeling is what we're seeing is a virus which normally affects the upper respiratory tract with a running nose and a sore throat, for some reason, gets down into lungs," said Kumar. There, the virus replicates quickly.</p>
<p>"We're trying, with very aggressive research, to figure out some of these things."</p>
<p>In the meantime, preventing the spread of the virus is all people can do.</p>
<p>"The best thing is not to get an infection in the first place," said Dr. John Embil.</p>
<p>Wash your hands, stay home if you're sick and, when the flu shot is ready, make sure you get it, said Embil, the medical director of infection prevention and control unit at HSC.</p>
<p>"The vaccine, every year, is the best possible prediction of what viruses might be in the environment," said Embil. "They'll try and include this specific strain and others that may be circulating in future," said Embil. "It's the best possible prediction-- not a guarantee." There are still immunity benefits from taking it, he said.</p>
<p>But it's no silver bullet because viruses change over time.</p>
<p>"It's Darwin in action -- survival of the fittest," said Embil. "Any germ will try and modify itself to survive in a host."</p>
<p>And the vaccine takes several weeks to work.</p>
<p>carol.sanders@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Seek help if symptoms serious, experts warn</p>
<p>ANYONE who develops serious flu-like symptoms should seek immediate medical attention, because no one can predict when the H1N1 flu will turn life-threatening in otherwise healthy people, infectious disease experts are warning.</p>
<p>Severe cases are occurring in which the infection starts off like regular seasonal flu, with fever and cough, but then the lungs rapidly become inflamed and stop functioning.</p>
<p>"It looks to most of us like a primary viral pneumonia that deteriorates five or six days into therapy," says Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital. "It's really severe illness."</p>
<p>"If you're young and healthy, you can recover from that severe lung injury. People do. But it takes a very long time," McGeer said. "Sometimes we're talking about a month, five weeks on a ventilator before you are breathing on your own. Some people can be left with so much residual lung damage, they will have abnormal lungs for their lifetime," she said.</p>
<p>But McGeer said attempting to identify whom this happens to "is the same as trying to pick out people who, faced with Group A (streptococcus), get necrotizing fasciitis -- flesh-eating disease -- when most of the rest of us get nothing, or minor illness," McGeer said. "The parallel is, I think, identical."</p>

</p>
<p>With drought threatening to dry up potential farm profits and hog producers struggling to stay in business, Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister Bob Bjornerud says there's no shortage of concerns to discuss at a national meeting with his counterparts.</p>
<p>"It's going to be a pretty broad discussion on a number of issues," said Bjornerud, shortly before leaving Tuesday for Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ont., where federal and provincial agriculture ministers hold their annual gathering later this week.</p>
<p>Federal Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz has in the past pointed to the existing suite of farm programs as a way to deal with some of the industry's woes, but Bjornerud said the programming isn't always helping.</p>
<p>"We need an explanation from him how he feels that that's going to address the problem with the drought and what's going on especially on the hog side of things right now, and if there's anything else out there," said Bjornerud.</p>
<p>He said he'll look for more information on the Agri-Recovery program, and how it might be able to help with specific issues. Meanwhile, a main national farm safety net program, Agri-Stability, could still use improvements, Bjornerud said.</p>
<p>"We need these programs to be more responsive to direct situations that are happening out there, and I don't feel that's happening right now."</p>
<p>The province's farmers aren't alone with the challenges they face, Bjornerud said. Alberta is experiencing drought, while the problems in the hog industry are widespread, Bjornerud said.</p>
<p>Pork producers had hoped to recover from a difficult period this year, but the H1N1 flu hit. First dubbed swine flu, the virus knocked prices back down. The virus also affected one Alberta pig herd and led to some trade bans, despite official declarations that pork is safe to eat.</p>
<p>"The hog industry has some specific things that they're going to put on the table and we'll be taking a good look at that and seeing if Mr. Ritz would be open to any of the suggestions that the hog industry has for them."</p>
<p>The Canadian Pork Council has prepared a transition plan to guide the industry through the next few years. The document outlines requests of the federal government such as a special H1N1 recovery loan plan and adjustments to an existing assistance program.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Updated H1N1 statistics hard to come by; Country's number of ventilators unknown</b>
</div><div>GLORIA GALLOWAY AND CAROLINE ALPHONSO </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA and TORONTO -- When Canadians started falling ill with the strain of influenza that has become a global pandemic, the Public Health Agency of Canada committed to providing updated statistics on the spread of the disease three times a week.</p>
<p>But Monday's reporting time came and went with no new numbers being posted on the health agency's website. Requests for an explanation went unanswered for about 20 hours until a spokeswoman explained that five of the provinces are now reporting their numbers of confirmed cases and fatalities just once a week.</p>
<p>That delay is typical of responses in recent days from the federal agency responsible for protecting the health of Canadians.</p>
<p>Liberal health critic Carolyn Bennett said yesterday that Canadians need frank explanations as medical experts prepare for what could be a dangerous surge this fall of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, as the World Health Organization has now designated it.</p>
<p>“I believe if we are going to go into something really tough in the fall, as it looks like we will, the trust in the relationship that the people of Canada have with [Chief Medical Officer of Health] David Butler-Jones and all of the chief public health officers across the country is going to be extraordinarily important,” she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Butler-Jones has been candid and informative when speaking to reporters. But the daily press conferences he held at the beginning of the outbreak, along with Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, have dwindled to every two weeks.</p>
<p>The Globe and Mail has been asking the Public Health Agency of Canada since last Thursday whether it knows how many medical ventilators exist across Canada.</p>
<p>The pandemic flu has severely affected more younger people than the usual seasonal influenzas. An unexpectedly large number have required treatment with the machines that pump air into their lungs, and for longer periods of time. So ventilators are becoming a critical resource.</p>
<p>PHAC, which plans to purchase an additional 370 machines, increasing its stockpile to 500, doesn't appear to know how many are available.</p>
<p>“We are currently assessing the number of ventilators across the country. But we are not waiting to get these figures – which is why we are taking action right now to increase our stockpile of ventilators,” a spokeswoman for the agency said in an e-mail.</p>
<p>Privately, senior Health Department officials say the numbers are difficult to obtain because of the balkanized nature of Canada's health-care system. Provinces and territories, which are responsible for tracking health-care resources, may provide that information to Ottawa but it's not within PHAC's mandate to release it.</p>
<p>Whether or not sufficient ventilators are in place, hospitals may face another related issue: technicians to operate them and isolation rooms to contain the disease.</p>
<p>“Ventilators you can probably buy, and you can move them around,” said Tim Brewer, the director of global health programs for the faculty of medicine at McGill University in Montreal. “But you can't ship isolation rooms.”</p>

</div><div>CHARLIE FIDELMAN  </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>503 words</div><div>8 July 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette  </div>
</p>
<p>Try not to get sick this month.</p>
<p>Off-season flus and closed beds mean this month is not the ideal time to wind up in hospital.</p>
<p>And annual summer vacations tax a hospital system already suffering from dwindling personnel: There isn't a floor, unit, operating block or clinic without staff shortages, said Lise Therrien, president of the nurses union at Sacré Coeur Hospital, which recently went on a recruiting mission for about 100 nurses, student nurses and auxiliary aides.</p>
<p>"We're at full capacity. But the patients aren't any less sick," Therrien said. "And when you're down one or two nurses per unit or floor, it shows."</p>
<p>Luckily, most of the people coming to the ER for swine flu testing (H1N1 influenza virus) are not being hospitalized, said Pascal Mailhot of Maisonneuve Rosemont Hospital, which is closing 63 surgery beds and 39 medical beds this summer.</p>
<p>The Montreal Health and Social Service Agency says there will be a total of 471 hospital beds closed this summer to accommodate vacation schedules.</p>
<p>That's on top of the 550 beds closed indefinitely because of hospital renovations or staffing problems, agency head David Levine said.</p>
<p>"There are always beds closed because of labour difficulties," he said. "We are in a real significant situation vis-à-vis the labour pool. This is the problem in health care today. At the moment we are managing as effectively as possible."</p>
<p>Bed closings are down from last year by 141 beds, he said. That's not going to help alleviate staffing pressures, but it means that 5,070 beds are available this summer compared with 4,929 last year, he said.</p>
<p>"We close beds that tend to be used for elective surgery," Levine said. "Accessibility targets" for surgeries such as heart, cataract, hip and knee should not be affected.</p>
<p>Also, wait times in emergency care are down slightly, he said.</p>
<p>"Overall, can the system respond with the number of beds? Yes.</p>
<p>"If you are sick, go to the hospital; they'll take care of you," Levine said.</p>
<p>But some emergency care physicians warn the ERs will be no picnic this summer.</p>
<p>They'll be jammed with people on stretchers waiting for admission to the wards, said Paul Saba, an emergency room doctor at Lachine Hospital.</p>
<p>Evaluations and surgeries are already delayed because of reductions in personnel, said Louis Dagenais of St. Luc Hospital at the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, which has the most bed closings with 117.</p>
<p>McGill University Health Centre is closing 55 beds.</p>
<p>"We're on 24/7; the ambulances will come and patients will wait," Dagenais said, comparing the ER to a hotel lobby during high season.</p>
<p>"If you were a hotel and your rooms were full, would you increase the size of your lobby?"</p>

<p>Critics are questioning a move by the Alberta Health superboard to dismiss the head of the provincial health laboratory as it struggles to cope with a heavy caseload during an emerging swine flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Dr. Jutta Preiksaitis, medical director of the Provincial Laboratory for Public Health and an internationally renowned expert in infectious disease control, was advised last week that her contract would not be renewed.</p>
<p>Preiksaitis, who recently won an award from the American Transplant Society, has been researching infectious diseases for 26 years.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services spokesman Mark Kastner would not say why the contract was not renewed, except that it was a human-resources issue and not a cost-cutting measure.</p>
<p>"We haven't eliminated the position," he said.</p>
<p>"There will continue to be a medical director and they will continue to have a similar role."</p>
<p>Preiksaitis is the fifth public health doctor to leave the provincial health service in recent months.</p>
<p>Liberal MLA Kevin Taft said Preiksaitis has been a champion for the provincial laboratory for more than two decades.</p>
<p>"It bodes ill for the health-care system," he said.</p>
<p>"If there is a serious outbreak of H1N1 virus, she is exactly the person you want on the job--not driven out of the province."</p>
<p>Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an associate professor of medicine in the University of Alberta's infectious diseases division, also questioned why Alberta Health Services would make the move when the province is facing an emerging swine-flu pandemic.</p>
<p>"To be quite honest, I am somewhat mystified," she said.</p>
<p>" I think there could probably have been some better timing for a change, or some dialogue as to what the perceived problems were."</p>
<p>She said Preiksaitis was "a very forward-thinking and responsible lab director and we appreciated how she improved care for patients."</p>
<p>Salinger said she was impressed with how well-prepared the provincial laboratory was for the deluge of testing for the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"I thought that under her leadership things seemed to be going very well," she said.</p>
<p>Salinger said she was "shocked and dismayed" by the decision not to renew the lab boss's contract.</p>
<p>"Of course, we would all be concerned when someone who we perceive as an ally in making diagnoses in difficult situations has been let go," she said. "She was also interested in expanding our repertoire and our diagnostic abilities and she's a very good virologist--and there are not a lot of good virologists around."</p>
<p>Dr. Geoffrey Taylor, director of the University of Alberta's infectious diseases division, said he was surprised by the move, but pleased that Preiksaitis will continue to do research in his department.</p>
<p>"She's an internationally recognized virologist and at an academic level is highly respected," he said. "The infectious diseases community, the specialists involved in treating people with serious infections in northern Alberta, have always had the utmost respect for Dr. Preiksaitis's leadership at the provincial lab and also for her expertise in virology.</p>
<p>She continues to be a member of our division and we're very happy she will continue and provide that expertise."</p>
<p>Preiksaitis could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>David Eggen, executive director of the Friends of Medicare, said the decision to replace the lab boss has all the earmarks of cuts in a bid to reduce the projected $1-billion deficit.</p>
<p>"Almost everything that Alberta Health Services is doing now is cuts, and if they try to frame it in any other way, it is misleading," he said.</p>

<p>DRUNKEN TRACTOR DRIVER IN SLOW-SPEED CHASE</p>
<p>BERLIN -A drunk German sparked a slow-speed police chase after stealing a tractor to get home from a nightclub after his girlfriend left without him, said police, who used pepper spray to try to stop the vehicle.

<p>JASLO, POLAND -An oak tree planted in Nazi-occupied Poland during the Second World War to mark Adolf Hitler's birthday may soon face the axe if the local mayor has her way. Authorities in Jaslo in rural southeastern Poland discovered the origins of the tree when plans were lodged to fell it to make way for a traffic roundabout.</p>
<p>BAYER GETS STIFFED BY POTENCY PILL HEIST</p>
<p>FRANKFURT -A gang of four looted 4.9-million euros ($6.9 million) worth of potency pills in a burglary at <span class="companylink">Bayer AG</span>'s BAYG. DE headquarters on Monday. Five weeks after burglars stole two barrels filled with 320,000 of Bayer's Levitra pills, Bayer said it had put up a reward of 20,000 euros for information leading either to the perpetrators being caught or the retrieval of more than half the swag.</p>
<p>THAT'LL DO PIG, ZOO TELLS ONLY PORKER</p>
<p>KABUL -Afghanistan's only known pig trotted out of quarantine Saturday, two months after he was locked away because of swine flu fears, to bask again in the mud at the Kabul Zoo. The pig, a curiosity in Muslim Afghanistan where pork and pig products are illegal because they are considered irreligious, was quarantined because visitors to the zoo were worried it could spread the new H1N1 flu strain.</p>

<p>We let them down</p>
<p>The article Police probe death in Wolseley (July 2) is a wake-up call for government to provide the necessary supports and services that persons with disabilities need so that in the future incidents like this are less likely to occur. Where was the staff? This is, after all, a halfway house for persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>Over the years I have come to know several individuals who reside at the Madison. The vast majority of the tenants are good people. Many have mental health issues and would, in my opinion, greatly benefit from some one on one support. I find this type of support lacking in the mental health field. Medication alone isn't enough. We need to provide better supports to help ensure that people don't fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>In many ways persons with disabilities are no different than the rest of us. They want to live in an environment where they feel safe and secure. And that's something we all want.</p>

<p>Neighbourhood blight</p>
<p>Heather Geddie (Empty houses should not be left to ruin, June 30) makes a good point when she describes the lack of housing options in central Winnipeg being exacerbated by property owners who leave houses empty, derelict or worse. She referenced Point Douglas, and I can tell you that the same happens here in West Broadway.</p>
<p>I would also advocate for the owners of such properties to be more responsible. The investment in mere holding properties by such irresponsible, often absentee, parties, in the face of housing needs and market demands, is irresponsible to a contemptible degree. If owners cannot afford to make these houses habitable, perhaps they should put them out on the market for someone who can.</p>
<p>I would encourage not only city forces, but also communities and residents, to demand more ethical business behaviours from such property owners.</p>

<p>Selling weapons</p>
<p>Mary Agnes Welch's article on Manitoba arms exports to Saudi Arabia shines a critical spotlight on a long neglected debate as to whether we as Canadians put our money where our mouths are when it comes to promoting peace and human rights in the world.</p>
<p>The Saudi government is a blatantly autocratic regime and, perhaps second only to the Taliban, is the most fundamentalist on Earth! Although what should be more concerning is the immense volume of arms sales going directly to the United States.</p>
<p>Canada is one of the largest exporters of weapons in the world, and according to Ken Epps in an article he wrote in the most recent issue of the Ploughshares Monitor, "The estimated value of Canadian military shipments to the U.S. is twice the value of shipments to all other recipients combined..."</p>
<p>These arms exports, apparently included some of the arsenal used in the U.S.-Iraq war which our country supposedly did not support. Under the 1956 Defence Production Sharing Agreement, essentially a free trade agreement for military goods, Canada can legally export arms to its southern neighbour without a permit.</p>

<p>Support family farms</p>
<p>The government of Manitoba has once again chosen political expediency over science. It is doling out another $37 million to the hog industry. Why? Because, in the words of the minister of agriculture, "the false connection to the H1N1 flu" is unjustly damaging the industry's economy!</p>
<p>She makes no mention of how she reached that conclusion or the growing body of evidence to the contrary with a variety of organizations raising alarms about the public health risks of confined animal feeding operations. Their concern rests with the high numbers of animals fed in these operations and the ease with which harmful viruses can establish and spread, as a result.</p>
<p>The Green Party of Manitoba is urging the government to move in a new direction; place an immediate freeze on the approval of any new CAFOs in this province and phase out existing ones which see both hog and chicken factories operating in close proximity.</p>
<p>It is now time to divert some of the massive public funding which has been flowing to a faltering industry into smaller and more sustainable, straw-based, family hog farms, instead.</p>

<p>Dishonest denial</p>
<p>In his letter Madhav L. Khandekar says "the Earth's mean temperature has been declining (albeit slowly) for the past 10 years or so, since about mid-1998." (Jury out on drought, July 6).</p>
<p>Khandekar, a self-described "expert," should realize that looking at the past 10 years would place his baseline in 1999, not 1998. He chooses 1998 as a baseline because that was an exceptionally powerful El Nino year, which caused a spike in global average temperature. Comparing subsequent temperatures to 1998 can give the false impression that the world is cooling, yet the overall global temperature trend continues to rise. It's the latest of many dishonest tricks in the global warming denial bag.</p>
<p>Khandekar further confuses when he says "many scientists now believe" that our recent global warming is the result of natural forces. Does he mean the 30,000 or so "scientists" that signed the Oregon Petition, a global warming denial petition that can be signed online or by mail? Luminaries like Perry S. Mason and Michael J. Fox are counted among scientists on that petition who doubt human activity is the root of our current global warming.</p>
<p>Every scientific academy and society in the industrialized world continues to hold the position that global warming is occurring and that we humans must reduce our greenhouse emissions to counter it. We are in the midst of a global crisis. The time for deceit and misinformation is over.</p>

<p>Picking student pockets</p>
<p>Recently all nursing students at the University of Manitoba received a letter informing them that for clinical practice in the fall (two days a week for the semester), we would need to be fitted for N95 masks, at a cost to the student of $40. These mask are the best defence against airborne illnesses in the hospital. But why are the students left to foot the bill?</p>
<p>The massive nursing shortage, in an influenza pandemic, will just get worse. When the nurses get sick, nursing students may be called up from the "reserves" to serve alongside their senior nursing "officers". Why is the university and government not providing this protection to student nurses? Every hospital nurse has this protection provided to them.</p>
<p>The cost of fitting student nurses with masks would be roughly $30,000 for the current students and $10,000 for each new group of nurses enrolling in the faculty. Seems like such a little price to pay to create a culture of safety and sense of trust in these student nurses.</p>

<p>Pastor believed to be H1N1 victim</p>
<p>A pastor from Oakbank is believed to be Manitoba's fifth H1N1-related death.</p>
<p>Manitoba Health reported the latest death in a release Monday. Perry Chernesky, a pastor at Oakbank Baptist Church, died early Sunday morning.</p>
<p>One Oakbank resident said she found out two weeks ago that Chernesky, 43, fell sick with flu-like symptoms, after another resident made calls around the community asking people to keep Chernesky in their prayers.</p>
<p>News of Chernesky's death swept quickly through the community, leaving many surprised.</p>
<p>"This is new to our church," said Howard Bredin, a church member and friend of Chernesky. "Nothing like this has ever happened." Chernesky's family declined comment and asked friends and congregation members not to comment.</p>
<p>"This is a private family matter and we'd like to keep it that way," said Chernesky's sister.</p>
<p>Chernesky's death marks a short life and an even shorter time in Oakbank. Chernesky had come to Oakbank only four years ago, Bredin said.</p>
<p>A funeral for Chernesky will be held Thursday morning at Oakbank Baptist Church, after which a public statement may be made, Bredin said.</p>
<p>In Manitoba, there are 685 confirmed cases of H1N1, many of them mild and not requiring hospitalization or isolation. The province is expected to make its next weekly H1N1 update on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A second Albertan and a child from Saskatchewan have also died after contracting H1N1. Both had pre-existing medical conditions.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>First Nations officials prepare for flu surge - Push for healthier living already in place</b>
</div><div>By Carol Sanders </div>
<div>670 words</div><div>7 July 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>THE day after Manitoba marked its fifth H1N1 death, emergency planners from southern First Nations gathered to try to prevent flu carnage in their communities when the flu surges this fall.</p>
<p>Sagkeeng is taking a cue from its elders and healers who've survived previous epidemics, said Christian Edwards, the community's fire chief and pandemic plan co-ordinator.</p>
<p>They're trying to do as much as they can to prevent people from getting ill, he said.</p>
<p>His community is trying to get back to healthier ways of living. A campaign in the schools has encouraged children to drink water instead of pop, and already produced results in happier, healthier kids, he said.</p>
<p>"Positive attitudes help keep the body healthy," said Edwards, who had a chance to talk to children about healthy lifestyles on the last day of school before their summer holidays.</p>
<p>Students are helping elders to pick traditional herbs and plants like sage and juniper for medicine, said Edwards, the father of two boys, ages one and three.</p>
<p>He was one of dozens of delegates attending a Southern Chiefs Organization H1N1 training session funded by the federal First Nations and Inuit Health Branch. A surge in flu cases is expected in the fall when people are back in school and working in close quarters. An H1N1 vaccine is also expected to be ready in October or November, requiring plans for a massive vaccination program.</p>
<p>In places like Sagkeeng, there are elders who remember the ravages of the 1918 Spanish flu in the community.</p>
<p>"If they got it in the morning, they were dead by nighttime," said Edwards.</p>
<p>There is a mass grave in Sagkeeng for those flu victims, said Edwards.</p>
<p>Edwards said his community with 4,400 on-reserve residents has four confirmed flu cases and is close to running out of hand sanitizer. They were given 18 one-litre dispensers, each with a one-litre refill. There are 20 public buildings in Sagkeeng.</p>
<p>The community north of Winnipeg is one of 36 First Nations that make up the Southern Chiefs Organization.</p>
<p>Edwards said he has faith in flu-fighting plans, and that the communities will be equipped to deal with the outbreak.</p>
<p>"The world today is more ready than it's ever been to cope with a pandemic," he said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the outbreak, each First Nation was given a July 15 deadline for submitting pandemic plans to the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch.</p>
<p>"We really need to get a sense of what level of preparedness our communities have," said Jim Wolfe, the health branch regional director.</p>
<p>Edwards said that attending the four-day conference in Winnipeg is eating up a chunk of his planning time, but he didn't want to miss anything that is going to help his community.</p>
<p>The province has millions of masks, gowns and gloves stockpiled in case of a surge in severe flu cases, Gerry Delorme with Manitoba Health told the First Nations pandemic planners.</p>
<p>"These are staggering numbers but our front-line health-care workers need to feel protected so they will come to work," Delorme told the delegates.</p>
<p>The province is responsible for guiding the response to a pandemic, while the federal First Nations and Inuit Health Branch is responsible for helping First Nations develop pandemic plans.</p>
<p>A nurse in one First Nation asked how they were supposed to predict how much vaccine they'd need when there's no final word on who the vaccine would help the most.</p>
<p>"That criteria will be based on our experience today of who's getting sick," said Dr. Linda Poffenroth, medical health officer with the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch.</p>
<p>Poffenroth said those most at risk of getting severely sick from the H1N1 virus are people with underlying health conditions and women in their third trimester of pregnancy or within a month of having their baby.</p>

<p>OTTAWA and TORONTO -- The latest Canadian victims of the pandemic virus that has claimed more than 400 lives worldwide include an apparently healthy pastor of a church in rural Manitoba – a hockey-playing father who fell ill on Father's Day.</p>
<p>The members of the Oakbank Baptist Church in Oakbank, a village just east of Winnipeg, were told at a church service on Sunday that Perry Chernesky had died of H1N1 at the age of 43. His sister said yesterday that family members were grieving and did not wish to speak publicly about their loss.</p>
<p>But Mr. Chernesky's neighbours were in shock. “He was healthy as far as I know. I don't think he had any medical conditions,” said one person who lives nearby, but who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, Mr. Chernesky, a father of two young daughters, had not been outside his house. “Then one of our neighbours said that [his wife] Claudia said she was sorry for her [neglect of] yard work, but that he'd been really sick,” said the neighbour.</p>
<p>A newsletter put out by another Baptist church in the province said that Mr. Chernesky was taken to Concordia Hospital in Winnipeg on June 21 and placed in isolation for “double pneumonia.”</p>
<p>Howard Bredin, a close friend of Mr. Chernesky who was also a board member of the church, told the CBC the pastor had played hockey this winter. “He was healthy and that was basically the story there,” Mr. Bredin said.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada normally releases new statistics about the spread of the virus every Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoon. They were not available late yesterday and agency officials did not explain why.</p>
<p>As of this past Friday, the number of people across Canada who had died of the virus was 29. But there were at least three deaths over the weekend, including that of Mr. Chernesky.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus, which is also called swine flu, differs from ordinary influenza in three key ways: its victims in Canada have been younger, they have been sicker and they've needed more time on ventilators.</p>
<p>“At the start of H1N1, when it was reported in Mexico, we went out and bought between 15 and 20 new ventilators,” Heidi Graham, spokeswoman for the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, said yesterday.</p>
<p>The federal government has announced it will increase own stockpile of ventilators from 170 to 500. And provinces from one side of the country to the other are deciding if they should do the same.</p>
<p>“We're in the process of working with the district health authorities and Emergency Health Services to assess ventilator capacity, including the number of ventilators and the staff they have to operate the equipment,” Nicole Watkins Campbell, a spokeswoman for Nova Scotia's Department of Health, said in an e-mail.</p>
<p>British Columbia had 976 ventilators in use as of May. A spokesman for that province's Health Ministry said officials are trying to decide whether that will get them through the next flu season, given the Manitoba experience.</p>
<p>In New Brunswick, where there are 106 ventilators, authorities are assessing the inventory to see whether it will stand up against what is now known about human swine flu.</p>
<p>Quebec's Minister of Health and Social Services, Yves Bolduc, told reporters yesterday that the province is well equipped with ventilators to face the pandemic expected to sweep the country this fall.</p>
<p>In the event of a shortage, Mr. Bolduc said many operating rooms are equipped with ventilators and minor surgical operations could be postponed so that the ventilators can be used instead to combat swine flu.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hotel industry woes felt by REITs; Royal Host units under pressure as investors weigh slumping occupancy, revenues</b>
</div><div>STEVE LADURANTAYE </div>
<div>905 words</div><div>7 July 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>B10</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

 </div>
</p>
<p>INVESTMENT REPORTER</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Royal Host REIT</span> saw its annual profit increase by 304 per cent in the past five years, but investors have been focusing on the future as they push the company's units lower to reflect the deep challenges facing the hotel industry.</p>
<p>The company – which owns and operates hotels across the country – is facing some of the most difficult conditions in the industry's history, putting pressure on its units and driving its yield above 20 per cent.</p>
<p>Smith Travel Research said occupancy at Canadian hotels fell in the last week of June by 11.2 per cent year over year, while revenue per available room swooned 19.7 per cent.</p>
<p>“It's really been a silent contraction in the hotel industry since so little attention has been paid to it,” said Rossa O'Reilly, an analyst at CIBC World Markets.</p>
<p>“New passport requirements for U.S. tourists returning to their country after visiting Canada, heightened concerns among travellers over the H1N1 virus and a 12-per-cent increase in the value of the Canadian dollar have been overlaid on U.S. travellers' tendency to vacation closer to home during the current recession.”</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at Royal Host – which ranked No. 1 in the recent ROB 1000 listings for annual profit growth from 2003 to 2008.</p>
<p>What does it do</p>
<p>Royal Trust's core holdings consist of 37 properties – comprised of 4,500 guest rooms in hotels branded under the Best Western, Country Inns & Suites, Hilton, Holiday Inn, Ramada, Super 8, Thriftlodge and Travelodge banners.</p>
<p>It also owns several unbranded properties, such as the Chimo Hotel in Ottawa.</p>
<p>It also manages properties for other hoteliers, and owns the franchise rights for Travelodge and Thriftlodge in Canada. There are more than 100 franchises.</p>
<p>The company also has an investment division, which at the end of last year owned 14 per cent of rival <span class="companylink">InnVest REIT</span> and 19.7 per cent of Holloway Lodging REIT.</p>
<p>Last year it recorded a $20.4-million profit, although in the first quarter of this year, it booked a $1.5-million loss as its revenue per available room slipped 9.3 per cent.</p>
<p>“The first quarter is traditionally a weaker quarter in the lodging cycle and should not be indicative of full-year performance,” said Scotia Capital analyst Mario Saric. “However, we remain overall bearish on hotel fundamentals and anticipate a challenging year ahead for the Canadian lodging sector as corporations continue cutbacks on travel expenditures and conference activity.”</p>
<p>What has its stock done</p>
<p>While the company's units are down about 7 per cent year to date, Mr. Saric suggested it could have been worse if management hadn't been voraciously buying back shares.</p>
<p>He said the company likely accounted for 40 per cent of the admittedly thin trading volume in the first quarter – spending $3.5-million to buy 1.2 million units (6 per cent) and another $1.5-million to purchase convertible debentures.</p>
<p>Royal Host is trading at about seven times 2009 estimated adjusted funds from operations, a measure commonly used to value REITs. <span class="companylink">InnVest REIT</span> trades at 4.9 times, while the broader sector trades at an average 9.2 times.</p>
<p>“We think a more substantial discount [to the sector average] could be warranted given high leverage on its balance sheet in a challenging environment,” Mr. Saric said.</p>
<p>Seven analysts follow the shares, according to Bloomberg, and all seven maintain “sell” ratings, with an average price target of $2.42. The shares hit a 52-week high of $6.90 in August, and a low of $2.06 in March.</p>
<p>The payout payoff</p>
<p>With a yield of 21.6 per cent, investors are pricing in the likelihood of lower payouts in the future (higher yields always indicate higher risk).</p>
<p>Executive vice-president Brad Cann defended the 66-cent annual payout in May's first-quarter conference call, but left the door open for a cut if conditions worsen.</p>
<p>“Sustaining our distribution continues to be front of mind and we've decided at the present time not to cut or suspend,” he said.</p>
<p>“At the same time, our goal is not to overdistribute in 2009.”</p>
<p>Mr. O'Reilly said the company is already paying out more than it is taking in, and expects a cut to come relatively soon.</p>
<p>“Simply put, they are paying out more than they should be,” he said.</p>
<p>“They are paying 66 cents. We think they'll make about 30 cents. This is an industry where profits are fluctuating – hotel REITs were never set up to provide reliable, forever-growing distributions.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>WestJet feels economic pinch in June sales</b>
</div><div>Lauren Krugel   </div>

<div>414 words</div><div>7 July 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.   </div>

<p>CALGARY</p>
<p><span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. flew emptier planes in June than the same month a year ago, as the economic downturn continued to exact its toll on the travel industry.</p>
<p>The Calgary-based airline said yesterday its June load factor -- a measure of how many available seats are filled by passengers -- was 72.9 per cent, down 3.6 percentage points from 76.5 per cent in June 2008.</p>
<p>Revenue passenger miles, a measure of passenger traffic, was down 7.1 per cent and available seat miles, or capacity, fell 2.5 per cent.</p>
<p>"We continue to tackle the difficulties of a tough economy," stated Sean Durfy, WestJet's president and chief executive officer. "Staying true to our fundamentals is extremely important in this challenging time for the airline industry."</p>
<p>The airline industry has taken a hit in recent months, as cash-strapped consumers rein in their travel spending. The H1N1 flu outbreak, which originated in Mexico, has also kept many passengers away from that popular vacation destination.</p>
<p>WestJet's business model was extremely lean well before the economic crisis hit, said Calgary-based airline analyst Rick Erickson.</p>
<p>One of the few tools airlines have at their disposal is to slash prices, "and that's why the revenue numbers are down and down so dramatically," he said. "I'd say for the consumers: Enjoy, because prices are as cheap as we've seen probably in 10 years."</p>
<p>WestJet says it's continuing to assess its capacity and where its aircraft are deployed.</p>
<p>It is also looking at ways to reduce costs.</p>
<p>For instance, in mid-June, WestJet bought out the lease of an 800-series aircraft that it took delivery of earlier this year.</p>
<p>"It is important for us to explore every area where we can save, and find the most effective opportunities to deploy capital," Durfy explained.</p>
<p>"In the current environment, returns on traditional forms of short-term investments are low. Deploying some of our cash to buy out this eight-year lease allowed us to reduce our aircraft leasing expense while maintaining flexibility in our liquidity through an unencumbered aircraft."</p>
<p>The summer tends to be a busy time for airlines, so Erickson said he'll be waiting to see how WestJet fares once the slower autumn season kicks in.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>How to come clean in seconds; Easy-to-clean keyboard especially suited for use in health-care facilities, schools</b>
</div><div>David Finlayson   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>508 words</div><div>7 July 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>A computer keyboard that's cleaned with the wipe of a cloth across its touch-sensitive flat surface should click with customers in an increasingly germ-wary world, an Edmonton company believes.</p>
<p>CleanKeys is especially suited for hospitals, doctors' and dentists' offices, schools and other institutions where computers have multiple users, says marketing director Don McCormick.</p>
<p>Studies show that computer keyboards are a leading cause of the spread of infection in health-care facilities, says McCormick, a technology veteran who was asked to join the CleanKeys team by Randy Marsden, president of parent company Madenta.</p>
<p>The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also warned that the swine flu virus could be spread through common touch surfaces such as computer keyboards, he says.</p>
<p>"It's perfect for any environment that has contamination of some kind. It takes seconds to spray it and wipe it down, while others in the market have a rubber coating that you have to immerse in water. And they still have key crevices where all kinds of things can get trapped."</p>
<p>CleanKeys has a glass or acrylic surface, with touch-sensitive keys that give an audible click for feedback. The sensitivity can be adjusted for people wearing gloves.</p>
<p>It's already attracting interest in the U. S. and Europe only 18 months after the first prototype came out, says McCormick.</p>
<p>CleanKeys was chosen as best new product at the 2007 American Dental Association conference, and two major U.S. dental-supply companies have signed up to distribute it. International distributors have also been lined up, mostly in Europe, he says.</p>
<p>CleanKeys retails for $399, which McCormick says is in the middle range among similar products.</p>
<p>"It puts us in a favourable position with our closest competitors, and it's not an awful lot of money for that kind of protection."</p>
<p>They expect to be able to bring the cost down in the next 12 months or so as manufacturing ramps up, he says.</p>
<p>The problem is, the company needs to grow so it can develop a marketing and distribution system, and money's not exactly growing on trees right now.</p>
<p>So it held its first investor session June 25.</p>
<p>"It's not like developing software. To produce 5,000 of the keyboards, the manufacturer wants half a million dollars up front," McCormick says.</p>
<p>"There's a very broad market for it out there, and the only thing standing between us and success is money."</p>

<p>CATCHING SWINE FLU TERRIFIED POTTER STAR</p>
<p>LONDON / Actor Rupert Grint, who plays Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter films, spoke Monday of his fears after contracting swine flu, saying he initially thought he might die.</p>
<p>Grint described contracting the H1N1 virus, which has spread around the world, as "quite scary," but he recovered after spending a few days in bed.</p>
<p>"I thought, 'Am I going to die?'" Grint, 20, said at a press conference with other Potter actors. "But it was just like any other flu really. I had a sore throat and I went to bed for a few days."</p>
<p>Grint was speaking ahead of today's world premiere in London of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the sixth instalment of the Harry Potter films. The movie opens in North America July 15.</p>
<p>WORLD'S OLDEST BIBLE PUBLISHED ONLINE</p>
<p>LONDON / About 800 pages of the world's oldest surviving Bible have been pieced together and published on the Internet for the first time, experts in Britain said Monday.</p>
<p>The Codex Sinaiticus, written in Greek on parchment leaves in the fourth century, is available online in a project involving institutions in Britain, Germany, Egypt and Russia which held different parts of the ancient book.</p>
<p>As part of the four-year joint project, digital photographs have been taken of the reunited manuscript, allowing scholars worldwide to research in-depth the Greek text, the British Library in London said.</p>
<p>ROCK FESTIVAL FUNDS CLIMATE PROJECTS</p>
<p>COPENHAGEN / The Roskilde rock festival in Denmark has given two million kroner ($373,000) to the humanitarian organization DanChurchAid to fund climate projects in Malawi, it said Monday. The donation is part of the festival's "Green Footsteps" campaign. The four-day event drew more than 80,000 people.</p>

<p>NORTH AMERICA</p>
<p>SERIAL CAT KILLER DUBBED A SOCIOPATH</p>
<p>MIAMI - A Florida court heard on Monday how a teenager accused of killing and dismembering 19 cats allegedly lured the felines to his home with food, in a bloody spree that sparked panic among Miami pet owners.</p>
<p>A police affidavit submitted during a court hearing told how Tyler Weinman, 18, entrapped the animals and then dismembered them, behaviour which a detective quoted in the document described as being consistent with a "sociopath."</p>
<p>Authorities accuse Weinman, who did not attend court on Monday, of mutilating the cats, cutting them open and leaving the corpses in their owners' yards.</p>
<p>Weinman faces 19 felony counts of animal cruelty, 19 counts of improperly disposing of an animal's body, and four counts of burglary.</p>
<p>The animal cruelty charges carry a penalty of up to six months in prison per count and a mandatory $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>Weinman has been under house arrest after paying a $249,500 bond, and has been ordered to get psychiatric treatment.</p>
<p>The judge said further hearings would be held on Friday.</p>
<p>STUDY OUTLINES BLOOD CLOT RISK</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - People who travel have nearly triple the normal risk of developing a dangerous blood clot, with a measurable increase for every two hours spent sitting in a car or wedged into an airline seat, researchers reported Monday.</p>
<p>They said the risk is serious enough to merit research into better ways to keep travellers healthy, although not severe enough to justify giving airline passengers anti-clotting drugs.</p>
<p>Dr. Divay Chandra and colleagues at Harvard University in Boston looked specifically at venous thromboembolism -- the development of a blood clot in a vein, usually in the legs.</p>
<p>Blood clots can also cause strokes and heart attacks when they form in arteries but VTEs can cause local damage or travel to the lung and kill.</p>
<p>Women who are pregnant or take birth control pills and the obese have an especially high risk, they found.</p>
<p>LEFTISTS REVEL IN ELECTION VICTORIES</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY - Midterm elections in Mexico, which dealt a heavy blow to the right-wing ruling party of President Felipe Calderon, marked the resurgence of the leftist opposition which ruled the country for most of the last century.</p>
<p>The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which held an ironclad grip on power in Mexico from 1929 until losing to Calderon's National Action Party (PAN) in 2000, now reclaims its historical role as the biggest bloc in the legislature after Sunday's vote, the party's leaders said.</p>
<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>BAYER STIFFED BY POTENCY PILL HEIST</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - A gang of four looted US$6.9 million worth of potency pills in a burglary at <span class="companylink">Bayer AG</span>'s headquarters, the company said on Monday.</p>
<p>Five weeks after burglars stole two barrels filled with 320,000 of Bayer's Levitra pills, Bayer said it had put up a reward of $27,900 for information leading either to the perpetrators being caught or the retrieval of more than half the swag.</p>
<p>The thieves cut through a wire fence and smashed a window in a building where the pills were stored before escaping unrecognized, German police said.</p>
<p>Bayer, whose products range from Aspirin painkillers to Yasmin birth control pills, says on its Levitra website that the pill may help men fight erectile dysfunction when other oral treatments do not work.</p>
<p>The stolen amount is equivalent to about five days of production for the global market.</p>
<p>150 PASSENGERS GET SICK ON CRUISE</p>
<p>LONDON - About 150 people have fallen ill aboard a cruise ship berthed in Scotland following a suspected outbreak of the vomit-inducing norovirus, health officials said Monday.</p>
<p>A 74-year-old English man has also died on board the Marco Polo, which is berthed near Invergordon in northeastern Scotland, but the ship's operators said his death was unrelated to the outbreak.</p>
<p>Two people have been hospitalized and the others are being treated on board, according to Ken Oates, the local National Health Service director of public health.</p>
<p>Norovirus is highly contagious and induces vomiting and diarrhea. It affects between 600,000 and one million people in Britain each year and outbreaks are common within contained environments.</p>
<p>Passengers on the world-famous Queen Elizabeth II luxury liner were struck by an outbreak in 2007.</p>
<p>DRUNK NABBED AFTER LOW-SPEED CHASE</p>
<p>BERLIN - A drunk German sparked a slow-speed police chase after stealing a tractor to get home from a nightclub after his girlfriend left without him, said police, who used pepper spray to try to stop the vehicle.</p>
<p>"After his girlfriend abandoned him in a nightclub, the 23-year-old driver, who doesn't own a licence, commandeered the vehicle to make his way home," a police spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>Six police cars began trailing the tractor, which was chugging along at 20 kilometres an hour, after they were alerted to the theft at about 5 a.m. on Saturday.</p>
<p>Officers tried holding up stop signs and directing pepper spray through the open window to bring the driver to a halt.</p>
<p>They then tried unsuccessfully to end his getaway by throwing nail belts on the road, but the tractor's tires proved too thick, said the police spokesman.</p>
<p>The 40-minute chase finally came to an end when officers shot at the tractor's tires after it rammed into a police car and collided with another vehicle.</p>
<p>CROATIA'S 1ST WOMAN PM TAKES OFFICE</p>
<p>ZAGREB - Jadranka Kosor became Croatia's first woman prime minister on Monday, vowing to revive the country's bid to join the European Union and tackle the economic crisis.</p>
<p>The journalist-turned-politician and her centre-right cabinet were approved by 83 deputies in a late night vote in the 153-member parliament. Forty-five voted against, no one abstained while the remaining were not present.</p>
<p>Kosor is succeeding Ivo Sanader who, after holding Croatia's most powerful political position for the past six years, shocked the nation by resigning last week, pushing the country into political turmoil.</p>
<p>The 56-year-old Kosor is taking up the mantle amid deep economic woes that have the country facing its worst crisis since its war of independence from the former communist Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.</p>

<p>MORE HONDURANS PROTEST AFTER DEATHS</p>
<p>TEGUCIGALPA - Supporters of ousted Honduras President Manuel Zelaya took to the streets Monday after two died in clashes with the army, as the deposed leader headed to Washington to meet with Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Zelaya said in Nicaragua that he would travel later in the evening to Washington where he would hold talks with the U.S. Secretary of State.</p>
<p>Several thousand of his supporters returned to the capital's streets Monday, in smaller numbers than the previous day but increasingly angry after the deaths of protesters.</p>
<p>"Assassins!" they shouted at a crowd of soldiers behind riot shields as they marched several hundred metres past the presidential palace.</p>
<p>A fake corpse covered in fake blood lay under a Honduran flag to represent the first deaths since the troubles began.</p>
<p>"We're going to continue with peaceful resistance despite the repression," union leader Juan Barahona told AFP.</p>
<p>ARGENTINES UNEASY OVER HANDLING OF FLU</p>
<p>BUENOS AIRES - Argentines are questioning the government's handling of an H1N1 flu outbreak that has killed 60 people amid confusion over the number of cases and accusations that officials acted too slowly.</p>
<p>President Cristina Fernandez has sought to halt the spread of the new swine flu strain at the height of the Southern Hemisphere winter by closing schools and letting public sector workers take time off.</p>
<p>But critics have chided her for going ahead with a congressional election last week and flying to Washington over the weekend to join a diplomatic mission to reinstate the ousted Honduran president while the flu death toll mounts.</p>
<p>"The government's clearly not handling this well," said Leopoldo Fernandez Suarez, an engineer who has sent his two children to Patagonia to get away from the capital and its suburbs where most cases have been reported.</p>
<p>"I don't pay any attention to what they're saying. I don't have any confidence in them," he added.</p>
<p>A two-year controversy over accusations the government is manipulating key economic data for political gain has also fuelled doubts about the extent of the outbreak of H1N1, which first emerged in Mexico and the United States earlier this year.</p>
<p>In less than a week, the Argentine death toll has more than doubled to 60, the third-highest confirmed H1N1 toll after the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>SOCCER PLAYER SHOOTS MOUTHY FAN</p>
<p>BOGOTA - A Colombian soccer player shot and killed a fan for calling him "lousy" on Sunday, days after the player's team lost a local championship, police said.</p>
<p>Javier Florez, a midfielder for the Atletico Junior team of the Caribbean city if Barranquilla, ran from the scene of the shooting but soon turned himself in to authorities.</p>
<p>Witnesses told police Florez shot Israel Castillo with a handgun after the 27-year-old electrician called him a "maleta" -- which in Colombian parlance describes a "lousy" player.</p>
<p>Atletico Junior lost the Apertura Championship final to a team called Once Caldas late last month.</p>
<p>The shooting recalled the case of Andres Escobar, a defender on Colombia's national team who was gunned down after a poor performance in the 1994 World Cup, which was played in the United States.</p>
<p>ASIA</p>
<p>PHILIPPINES BOMB INJURES 'MANY'</p>
<p>ZAMBOANGA - A powerful bomb exploded today outside a hardware store in the southern Philippine island of Jolo, and initial reports suggested that "many" people had been wounded, police said.</p>
<p>Another bomb was found and disarmed, planted near a Catholic church also in Jolo, police said.</p>
<p>The attack came just two days after a powerful bomb blamed on Islamic separatist rebels exploded outside a Catholic church in Cotabato city, also in the south, killing five and wounding about 50 others on Sunday.</p>

<p>EX-CONGRESSWOMAN RELEASED BY ISRAEL</p>

</div><div>By Kelly Funke   </div>

<p>Hard times</p>
<p>for hog</p>
<p>farmers</p>
<p>By Kelly Funke</p>
<p>The province has answered Manitoba hog industry pleas for financial aid with a federal-provincial Targeted Advance Payment totaling $37.3 million. That may sound like a huge bailout for so-called factory farms to those with extreme views, but to those whose livelihoods depend on hog farming, it sounds like a drop in the ocean. They want Manitobans to understand that they need direct financial aid that will see them get back on their feet and allow them to resume contributing to the local and provincial economies.</p>
<p>The pork industry contributes upwards of $1 billion to the provincial economy. More than 13,000 Manitobans are employed directly or indirectly by the pork industry. A large number of the new immigrants to Manitoba touted by the government just last week came to work in the pork industry, many of them on the province's 800 or so hog farms. (In fact, "industrial butchers" and "farm supervisor and spec. livestock workers" are two of the top 10 job categories filled by these new immigrants.) Manitoba's hog industry includes farms of many shapes and sizes, from large-scale indoor operations to mid-size outdoor/indoor operations, to small outdoor operations coupled with grain production. There are large companies, Hutterite colonies, families and individuals operating hog farms.</p>
<p>Another truth about the industry was evident at a rally of hog farmers on June 22 when about 600 people filled a hall in Morris to capacity. There were couples, families with children anywhere from infancy to early 20s. They watched and listened, solemn-faced, to their industry spokesmen, federal and provincial politicians and other farm leaders. Finally, they heard an experienced farm-debt mediator explain that they have many options and they should accept that it may indeed be time to leave the industry.</p>
<p>Staff at the Manitoba Pork Council regularly take phone calls from people who are in such desperate financial straits that some have been driven to ask, "What's left for me but to shoot myself?" It's not an exaggeration. That's just the way it is these days.</p>
<p>And to be fair, it's not everyone's story. Some farms are succeeding. Some farmers continue to struggle and explore their options.</p>
<p>Consider this typical independent Manitoba hog farm with a handful of employees. Among them are people who have been with the farm for a couple of decades, a disabled worker who may have trouble working at another job that requires long hours and intense concentration, and a few who speak little English. At least one worker has a large family to support, another has an ill family member, and several are recent immigrants. Only one of them may have luck in finding another job, the farmer fears. Each of these people currently receives full health benefits along with their regular pay.</p>
<p>In mere months this family may have to stop farming and let their workers go.</p>
<p>That means they will also stop supporting the local feed company, the trucking company, the local bank, the local vehicle dealership, the local sporting goods store, local restaurants and other local businesses. The employees may have to depend on employment insurance and will most likely also stop being able to support local businesses at the same level.</p>
<p>All these folks ask is help to refinance in order to continue the way of life they love, to continue employing people in the community, caring for their animals, and producing the best pork in the world. The entire pork production system is aware of the cyclical nature of the industry. But this set of compounding circumstances -- low hog prices, high feed grain prices, the high Canadian dollar, Country of Origin Labelling and finally H1N1 flu -- is more than most could have predicted.</p>
<p>The true consequences of inaction will be far-reaching and will take their largest toll on the humans behind the industry.</p>

<p>111Public health officials in Britain and Canada report stories of people thinking a return to the days when people would corral their kids for chicken pox parties -- play dates with an infected friend -- is a good way to prepare for the possibility that H1N1 will return this fall with a stronger bite.</p>
<p>H1N1 should not be compared to chicken pox. While the rare child got extremely sick with chicken pox, and a rarer one died of the once common-place childhood infection, the influenza racing across the globe has a higher kill rate, puts many in the hospital and is a real threat to those with underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>Just how lethal the H1N1 is still being calculated. In Manitoba, where 685 cases of H1N1 are confirmed, it has had tremendous impact on some aboriginal communities, with First Nations people disproportionately falling very sick. Canada, from reported cases, appears to be hit hard, with 20 cases per 100,000 population, compared to a rate of 7.1 in Mexico and the United States. (Experts caution that this may be due to higher testing in this country.) To date, 31 Canadians testing positive for H1N1 have died, four in Manitoba.</p>
<p>Alarmingly, the fast-spreading flu is making an aggressive return in countries, such as Mexico, where it had waned. This may give epidemiologists insight as to whether H1N1 is changing to outsmart natural defences, allowing it to become a greater threat.</p>
<p>Public health officials have struggled to put this pandemic in context, particularly after initial reports early this spring raised the alarm of a new, seemingly virulent bug arising in Mexico. Officials in Manitoba stress that the vast majority stricken with H1N1 suffer mild or non-threatening symptoms, not unlike the seasonal flu, and all but a few recover. H1N1 is unusual for the season it appeared and because, unlike seasonal flu, it is striking hardest the population considered society's strongest -- those between 20 and 60 years old. In this, it resembles past lethal pandemics.</p>
<p>Parents understandably are anxious to protect their kids, and it is a natural instinct not to rely entirely upon the vigilance of public health officials in preparation. Indeed, just as the epidemic was hitting Manitoba with force, public health officials noted that H1N1 had already reached every school.</p>
<p>It is foolhardy, though, to think playing the odds with H1N1 is a better bet than relying upon the proven defences -- handwashing, covering up a cough or sneeze, tough as they are to teach a toddler.</p>
<p>Public health officials and politicians should be reminding people that an H1N1 vaccine is expected to be ready in October, to help protect the unexposed. This is a message that bears repeating, particularly as news of H1N1 develops. An informed public is a better prepared population.</p>
<p>Wide discussion on the benefits and risks of the vaccine under development and how it will be rolled out to the public may inspire more confidence among the skeptics and the fearful, who all too naturally seek to protect those most vulnerable, most precious to them.</p>

</p>
<p>A while ago, I woke to hear a radio news item of a few confirmed cases of H1N1 flu at Jack MacKenzie Elementary School.</p>
<p>This is alarming for several reasons.</p>
<p>First, this is proof the H1N1 virus has spread to not just Canada, but Regina.</p>
<p>Second, Jack MacKenzie School is just up the road from my house.</p>
<p>Ever since the virus broke out from Mexico, people have been a bit crazy about protecting themselves. Even I'll admit that waking up to that announcement made me a little fearful, too.</p>
<p>But I gave it some thought and realized there are a few simple, but incredibly important, things everyone can do to help protect themselves from the H1N1 virus and other infections, colds, and sicknesses.</p>
<p>- First and foremost, wash your hands. It's very easy to do, but you have to remember to do it. Germs spread quickly through the contact of our hands. Think about it. How many people shake hands every single day? Think of all of the people who type on a public computer keyboard. It only takes one person to not wash their hands -- and them someone else picks up the germs.</p>
<p>- When you use the washroom, public or private, remember to wash your hands with warm water and soap. Also wash your hands after handling money and before and after you eat. It's a straightforward thing that effectively stops a lot of germs from spreading. There are a few other things you can do to protect yourself and others.</p>
<p>- In a public washroom, if you reach over to the paper towel dispenser after you've washed your hands, you should think about how many other hands have touched it. Unless the dispenser is automatic -- which many are -- you should take out some paper towels before washing your hands. That way, you can wash your hands, grab the paper towel, and dry your hands without neutralizing the washing of your hands. Take it one step further and use the paper towel to open the door.</p>
<p>- You can get flu shots annually. It's a great way to defend yourself from getting an illness and it's beneficial to others . . . if you don't catch a bug, you can't spread the bug.</p>
<p>- Carry around some hand disinfectant. You can buy it in little bottles, so you can put one in your purse (if you have one) or in your pocket (if you don't). Before you eat (at a public restaurant, for example), you can use the disinfectant to cleanse your hands of any germs you've collected throughout the day.</p>
<p>- I have to stress something I consider a must. If you have to sneeze or cough, don't just do it out into the open. There are millions of germs in a single cough or a sneeze. By just "letting one go" uncovered, you are spreading countless germs to everybody around you.</p>
<p>Is it really that hard to grab a tissue? If you don't have one handy, cough into your sleeve, not your hands. By covering your sneezes and coughs with fabric or tissue, not skin, you are preventing millions of germs from spreading to the people around you.</p>
<p>These are a few basic things you and I can do to prevent the multiplication of germs. You are protecting yourself and everyone around you. Following these tips will assist in maintaining your own personal health. It's even enough to reduce your chances of further illness, counting the H1N1 virus, which can be potentially fatal.</p>
<p>Washing your hands daily, using disinfectant on your hands, getting a flu shot, and covering your coughs and sneezes all decrease your chances of getting ill.</p>
<p>Protect yourself and protect others by taking these measures!</p>

</p>
<p>Dear Editor - Re: Labour Unions Have Outlived Their Usefulness -- June 30</p>
<p>So, the trash starts piling up nowhere near Guelph and the beat-on-the-unions-bat gets rolled out from under the bed yet again.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate the mainstream media --who love to push the anger buttons of guys such as letter-writer John Warnbuckle -- have labelled the job action in Toronto as the "trash strike." It's about a heck of a lot more than that -- but people do love simple, tidy, Bush-style good guy/bad guy extremes.</p>
<p>How could a trash collector, child-care worker or paramedic not work hard? Do you not think that if a paramedic caught the H1N1 flu they would take some time off, or would they just keep on working to cash out on the sick day gravy? The multimillion-dollar payout for sick time would only happen if no one ever got sick, even once.</p>
<p>If you want to see real excessive wages and benefits, <span class="companylink">Google</span>: Sunshine List Ontario and prepare to have your mind blown. It's still a world where an eHealth consultant can charge $7,000 for one speech -- an amount which would take a minimum wage worker in this province well over 700 hours to make, and even longer if you consider deductions. And many of those workers possess talents and skills far greater than their fiscal reward will ever be.</p>
<p>Who fights for them? Why can't they expense their Choco-Bites?</p>
<p>If anyone has ever enjoyed a weekend off, an eight-hour workday or a paid vacation, then you have the union movement to thank. These gains weren't just given to workers by benevolent bosses. We had to fight for them, together. I'm sorry if that isn't enough rugged frontier individualism for you, but many of us prefer to work together, co-operatively, in this century as in the last.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Steam washers Cleaning up; Entrepreneurs who remove chewing gum from streets inspired by Dirty Jobs</b>
</div><div>Graham Lanktree   </div>
<div>Special to the Star</div>
<div>1051 words</div><div>6 July 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>B01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>MONTREAL -- Near the bustling intersection of St-Catherine and St-Denis, friends and business partners Brent Gray, 21, and Sebastien Dupere, 23, supervise as jets of steam from their steam cleaner vaporize the fossilized wads of chewing gum littering the ground at their feet.</p>
<p>Neither young entrepreneur realized steam-cleaning gum could be such good business when they were thinking about starting their own company a little more than a year ago. But after watching a profile of New York City's Gum Busters on an episode of Discovery Channel's Dirty Jobs, they had an inkling.</p>
<p>North Americans chew roughly 50 million pieces of gum a day, and as anyone who lives in a big city knows, you can find the sticky goo everywhere; on sidewalks in front of busy storefronts, on escalators in malls and, frequently, on the soles of our shoes.</p>
<p>"We'd been leaning toward cleaning up graffiti, but there's so much competition," says Gray. "With a little more research we realized no one in Quebec was cleaning up gum like this."</p>
<p>Montreal's Les Degommeurs were born.</p>
<p>After pooling their money and purchasing a $5,000 steam cleaner from Italian manufacturer Tecnovap, Gray and Dupere started scrubbing gum outside businesses like McDonald's, the Sheraton hotel and Montreal's Trudeau airport.</p>
<p>They found other cleaning companies were removing gum using high-powered pressure washes or CO2 and chemical sprays that freeze or corrode the petroleum-based gum so it can be chiselled away manually.</p>
<p>These methods aren't efficient, Gray explains. "If you use CO2 on a carpet it rips it apart, and doesn't always remove the gum. Pressure washing destroys surfaces, shoots the gum everywhere and wastes gallons of water."</p>
<p>Steam cleaning, on the other hand, blasts a 160C stream of steam directly on the gum glob. Since chewing gum's synthetic rubber base melts at 115C, the steam vaporizes it without leaving a mark.</p>
<p>"Steam is environmentally friendly, we use completely biodegradable solvents and only one to two litres of water an hour, it's easy on surfaces, and the machine's vacuum nozzle sucks up all the particles."</p>
<p>Demand was so great they ordered another steam cleaner, and then another. By the end of last summer Les Degommeurs had pocketed $170,000 from various contracts with Montreal businesses ranging from $200 to $3,000.</p>
<p>Now Les Degommeurs are the ones being filmed; this time for an episode of Les Jobs de Bras, Quebec's version of Dirty Jobs, and they've taken their business nationwide in only a year. Last September they received a call from a new steam cleaning start-up in Vancouver called Gum Fighters that wanted to buy a Tecnovap machine but couldn't find one in Canada. This got Gray and Dupere thinking and by October they had sealed an exclusive agreement with Tecnovap to distribute the company's equipment in Canada.</p>
<p>"There are all sorts of applications for steam cleaning beyond just removing gum," says Gray. It can be used to clean and disinfect restaurant kitchens or industrial food processing plants, hospitals, greasy machinery, the upholstery in used cars, and the bottling done at breweries and vineyards.</p>
<p>"I can see how good the market is," adds Tremblay, "it's almost wide open."</p>
<p>The partners also incorporated to become Dupray Industries, offering steam cleaning and a range of steam cleaners.</p>
<p>"All the money we made from Degommeurs we put back into the business," says Dupere.</p>
<p>"We have no loans and no debt. We're building ourselves on a very solid foundation."</p>
<p>In these times of listeria outbreaks and swine flu, steam may be the answer. Research published in the Journal of Food Protection shows some bacteria are developing resistance to traditional cleaning chemicals such as Peracetic acid. But bacteria can't adapt to a 160C jet of steam that can reach in and kill pathogens lodged in nooks and crannies.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Dupray joined forces with the Gum Fighters, who have become their partners and West coast distribution branch. Dupray has also opened a Toronto office staffed by an electrician who repairs steam machines for their clients and manages Les Degommeurs' cleaning contracts in the region.</p>
<p>There will be plenty of business to go around. A survey in the January issue of Food Processing magazine found that food safety ranked as the top priority among industry respondents and 51 per cent said they planned to buy new and improved sanitation equipment.</p>
<p>However, the current challenge is in convincing these businesses to buy into steam cleaning. Many breweries, for example, are skeptical about the technology.</p>
<p>"You're looking at an investment of about $25,000 for an industrial steam cleaner, and for us that just doesn't make sense," says Simon Rollason, plant manager at Toronto craft brewer, Great Lakes Brewery.</p>
<p>But Gray and Dupere are already changing minds. In March Dupray made its first sale and has since sold 15 steam cleaners.</p>
<p>"We've got another 20 in the pipeline for next month," says Dupere. "There's a client in New York City who turned to us because he's dissatisfied with companies in the U.S."</p>
<p>"In the coming year I think we can reach every sector where this technology can be applied," says Tremblay.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the past year, Gray and Dupere agree that picking up chewing gum is not the thing you'd think of when coming up with an an idea for a successful business.</p>
<p>"But hey, that's the beauty of business," Tremblay added.</p>

<p>Actor needed anti-flu spell</p>
<p>Harry Potter actor Rupert Grint is recovering from a "mild bout" of swine flu, his publicist says.</p>
<p>Grint, who plays Ron Weasley, took a few days off filming but has now returned to the set of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Filming wasn't delayed by his absence.</p>
<p>He is well enough to attend the world premiere of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in London tomorrow. "He has now recovered and is looking forward to joining his fellow cast members," his publicist said. She said that Grint's doctor had confirmed the 20-year-old actor was no longer contagious or at risk of infecting others.</p>

<p>Family illness makes Hip hop off Virgin Fest bill</p>
<p>Music fans got an unexpected invitation to a free concert Saturday after The Tragically Hip had to cancel their headlining spot because of an illness in the family.</p>
<p>The gates were thrown open at the Virgin Festival Nova Scotia site at the foot of Citadel Hill, allowing fans to hear The Offspring, Metric, Dinosaur Jr. and five other bands for free.</p>

<p>Little People tell TV to retire the M-word</p>
<p>The group Little People of America called yesterday for the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to ban the use of the word "midget" on broadcast TV.</p>
<p>Leaders of the group said the word, which was featured in an episode of NBC's Celebrity Apprentice, is as offensive as racial slurs.</p>
<p>"Historically, the word 'midget' has been used to objectify people, like in the circus," said Clinton Brown III, co-chairman of the 52nd Annual National Conference of Little People of America.</p>
<p>In the April 5 Celebrity Apprentice episode, contestants including Joan Rivers created a detergent ad called "Jesse James and the Midgets." The contestants suggested bathing little people in the detergent and hanging them to dry.</p>
<p>Members of Little People of America responded by filing a complaint with the FCC.</p>
<p>"This is not just a complaint but a kickoff to educate Americans unaware that the 'M-word' is offensive to little people," said Michael Petruzzelli, whose 6-year-old son is a little person.</p>

<p>Rain heads north</p>
<p>Earth's most prominent rain band, near the equator, has been moving north at an average of almost 1.6 kilometres a year for three centuries, likely because of a warming world, scientists say. The band supplies freshwater to almost a billion people and affects climate elsewhere. If the migration continues, some Pacific islands near the equator that today enjoy abundant rainfall may be starved of freshwater by mid-century or sooner, researchers report in the July issue of the journal Nature Geoscience. “We're talking about the most prominent rainfall feature on the planet, one that many people depend on as the source of their freshwater because there is no groundwater to speak of where they live,” said Julian Sachs, associate professor of oceanography at the University of Washington and lead author of the paper.</p>

<p>Is that kid scared?</p>
<p>“Researchers have shown that we subconsciously detect whether others are scared by picking up chemicals they release from their bodies,” The Daily Telegraph reports. Bettina Pause and colleagues at the University of Dusseldorf in Germany collected sweat from 49 students before they were due to write an exam and also when they worked out on exercise bikes. Volunteers weren't able to sniff the difference in the “panic sweat” and “exercise sweat,” but their brain scans showed that the panic sweat lit up brain areas that deal with emotional and social signals, and empathy. The study is reported in the journal PLoS One.</p>
<p>Honest trousers?</p>
<p>Nepal's anti-corruption authority has come up with a novel solution to rampant bribe-taking at the country's only international airport – the pocketless trouser, Agence France-Presse reports. The authority said it was issuing the new, bribe-proof garment to all airport officials after uncovering widespread corruption at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport. “We sent a team to observe the growing complaints about the behaviour of airport authorities and workers towards travellers and we discovered that the reports were true,” said Ishwori Prasad Paudyal, spokesman for the Commission for the Investigation of the Abuse of Authority. “So we decided that airport officials should be given trousers with no pockets. We have directed the ministry of civil aviation to implement our order as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>How speed-eaters do it</p>
<p>In 2007, four doctors at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine conducted an experiment on the stomach activities of a competitive eater and an average eater, CNN.com reports. The average eater ate seven hot dogs before he felt sick. The champion speed eater, a trim 29-year-old at the time, ate 36 hot dogs in 10 minutes before doctors intervened. His stomach did not have muscle contractions called peristalsis, which move the food down the digestive tract. Instead, the hot dogs sat in his stomach and “protruded enough to create the distinct impression of a developing intrauterine pregnancy.” In an opinion piece published in the American Journal of Radiology, the doctors warned of possible morbid obesity, intractable nausea and vomiting and even the need for a gastrectomy – surgical removal of all or part of the stomach.</p>
<p>Flu and indigenous people</p>
<p>“Indigenous peoples, such as Aborigines and Native Americans, have low-quality health which puts them at a higher risk from swine flu, experts have warned,” BBC News reports. “There are around 400 million people around the world who are classed as indigenous. Australian researchers, writing in The Lancet, warn flu risk is increased because they are more likely to be malnourished and living in poverty. One Aboriginal man has already died from swine flu, and [native people] in Canada have seen many cases.”</p>
<p>Retirement planning</p>
<p>“How tough is it living off $2.5-million (U.S.)? Ruth Madoff is about to find out,” Brett Arends writes in The Wall Street Journal. “Bernie Madoff's wife has been left with a lump sum in that amount from her settlement with the Justice Department. … As for investments: Mrs. Madoff is 68. She will need income to live on for maybe 30 years or more. She's going to have to generate income to live on, and enough growth to keep up with inflation. That's going to mean a conservative mix of stocks and bonds. … The irony, of course, is that Mrs. Madoff really needs right now a financial adviser she can trust to handle her money.”</p>

<p>Christie Lake Camp sent home 120 children and its staff on Canada Day after 55 campers and several staff members developed symptoms similar to H1N1 swine flu, the director of the camp said Saturday. Daniel Wiseman said the children were disappointed because they had to go home after spending only a week at camp, but their parents understood the move was necessary to prevent the spread of the flu. Among the 326 accredited camps that belong to the Ontario Camps Association, Christie Lake Camp is the first to report an apparent swine flu outbreak. The camp for nine- to 15-year-old children is on Christie Lake, about 100 kilometres west of Ottawa.</p>

<p>Swine flu infected one of the main stars in the latest Harry Potter movie, a publicist said in London on Saturday, as new deaths and fears of a carve-up on vaccine access underlined the gravity of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Three days before Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince premieres in London, actor Rupert Grint, who plays Ron Weasley in the series, was revealed to have taken several days off filming the next instalment, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.</p>
<p>"He has now recovered and is looking forward to joining his fellow cast members at the junket and premieres this week and will then return to filming directly afterwards," his publicist said in a statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, global health bosses warned that international politicking could prevent lives being saved in poor countries.</p>
<p>Universal access to a swine flu vaccine remains a "critical question," World</p>
<p>Health Organization assistant director-general Keiji Fukuda said during a summit on the virus in the Mexican beach resort town of Cancun.</p>

<p>They go together like lime and cerveza, a beach chair and a pool deck and nachos and guacamole.</p>
<p>But the Mexican towns of Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo, separated by just five kilometres of rolling seaside jungle and connected by a four-lane highway, couldn't be farther apart.</p>
<p>At least from a tourist's perspective.</p>
<p>Zihuatanejo was established by Spanish Conquistadors some 500 years ago as New Spain's first shipyard.</p>
<p>Ixtapa was built by World Bank bureaucrats in the early 1970s as part of the Mexican government's ambitious resort-building program (Cancun was created the same way and at the same time).</p>
<p>Zihuatanejo is anchored by a small fishing village that has provided fresh seafood daily to the residents and restaurants in the area for centuries.</p>
<p>Ixtapa is anchored by a sprawling Hotel Zone organized in so-called super-blocks owned by big-name hotel chains, and features many restaurants and nightclubs with familiar names to Canadian urbanites.</p>
<p>Zihuatanejo's beach is popular with locals, though each waterfront hotel and villa has its own assigned beachfront.</p>
<p>Ixtapa's beach is limited pretty much to tourists, apart from the friendly hawkers shopping their wares of beads, silver and parasailing up and down the sweeping and sandy crescent-shaped beach.</p>
<p>But what really sets these two distinct resorts apart is their proximity to one another. Meaning that while your accommodation is based in one or the other, your daytime and nighttime activities run the gamut from the best of both worlds: Old Mexico and New Mexico.</p>
<p>IF YOU GO</p>
<p>Bargains abound for Ixtapa and similar all-inclusive resorts towns up and down the Pacific, with the large corporate hotel chains offering cut-rate prices across the board in hopes of stimulating a tourist business that has turned to a trickle since the H1N1 virus -- swine flu -- appeared in Mexico in spring.</p>
<p>Likewise, the mom and pop small resorts and villas of Zihuatanejo have slashed nightly rentals.</p>
<p>Flights from major Canadian cities to Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo have also been deeply discounted -- until the 2009-10 winter season kicks in.</p>

<p>A dozen more cases of the H1N1 flu virus have been confirmed in the Windsor and Essex County area since mid-June -- all involving children or teenagers.</p>
<p>Friday, Dr. Allen Heimann of the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit announced that four cases have been found in the past week -- a seven-year-old boy, 12-year-old boy, 13-year-old girl and 16-year-old girl.</p>
<p>"(There is) no connection, as far as we can determine, between the four," Heimann said.</p>
<p>These latest local cases come in addition to eight confirmed cases that the health unit received notification about on June 26. Those eight patients developed their symptoms between June 12 and 21, and range from a seven-year-old girl to a 19-year-old female.</p>
<p>With these additions, the region has now had a total of 20 confirmed H1N1 cases -- 10 males and 10 females. Previous confirmations of the virus involved adult patients.</p>
<p>Despite the increase in cases and the relative youth of the new patients, Heimann stressed that there is no cause for alarm.</p>
<p>"We have five cases per 100,000 population." The provincial average is near 30 cases per 100,000 people. "Our number of cases is significantly lower than the province, and the cases that we have, have been generally mild."</p>
<p>Only two of the patients among the recent cases were hospitalized -- the seven-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl. Both have since been discharged. Some of the other patients were taken to Windsor Regional Hospital or an urgent care facility, but none required admittance. Heimann said the health unit remains in contact with area hospitals daily.</p>
<p>As of July 3, the Ontario Ministry of Health has reported there are 3,464 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus across the province.</p>
<p>Symptoms of a respiratory illness related to the virus include sudden onset of shortness of breath, high fever, chills, muscle ache, headache, eye pain and extreme fatigue.</p>
<p>"If you are ill with flu-like symptoms, don't go to work. Don't attend summer activities such as summer school or summer camp," Heimann said.</p>
<p>Spread of the virus can be prevented by handwashing, proper cough and sneeze etiquette and prompt disposal of tissues.</p>
<p>Heimann said the majority of people who experience symptoms do not require hospitalization, and proper bed rest and consumption of fluids are the best practices for recovery. Those with pre-existing medical conditions or severe symptoms are advised to contact their health care practitioner.</p>

</p>
<p>Canada has seen a drop in swine flu cases, good news that's being largely attributed to the fact school is out.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada is undertaking surveillance of the H1N1 influenza virus by gathering information from several hundred "sentinel practitioners" across the country. They report weekly on the number of patients they see with influenza-like illness and this serves as an indicator for the number of new H1N1 cases countrywide.</p>
<p>For the week ending June 27, sentinel practitioners reported 34 consultations with patients for influenza-like illness for every 1,000 patients visits, down from 42 the week before, for a drop of 19 per cent. "This is good news. It happened the week that schools closed and I would guess that there is probably a reasonable link there," Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious diseases prevention for the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, said yesterday.</p>
<p>He expects the numbers to continue to go down over the summer because students won't be infecting each other in school and because influenza viruses tend not to like humid weather. Still, he said, it's difficult to accurately predict where this virus is going.</p>
<p>"It's reasonable to say that the dropping trend might continue if you believe the idea the schools have an important role to play in this. But I'm not putting any money down on it. ... It's a pandemic virus and they do weird things," he said.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Hog farmers say they are losing thousands of dollars and considering euthanizing healthy pigs because they are battling bankruptcy without government aid.</p>
<p>Dozens of farmers -- with 50 pigs -- gathered at the provincial legislature yesterday to protest what they call government inaction in the face of a crisis that has been growing for years and worsened by fears around the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"We're just digging the hole deeper,'' said John Gough, who has a 300-sow operation in Mount Brydges, Ont.</p>
<p>"Country logic would say if you get in a hole, quit digging. Well, we can't quit digging. Are we going to let them starve?''</p>
<p>Gough said farmers are losing $50 a pig as they try to feed and raise hogs for slaughter, and new farmers are in the most dire straits because they don't qualify for government aid available to established ones.</p>
<p>Protesters said farmers who have started since 2005 were left out of the $150-million package in favour of established and retired pork producers.</p>
<p>"Those people who are the future of our industry, not just for pork but for all of agriculture, can't keep doing it,'' Gough said.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Leona Dombrowsky said yesterday the payments young farmers are requesting were part of a one-time aid package to help struggling producers recover from past losses, not a program that was meant to continue.</p>
<p>There are cost-sharing programs that work in partnership with the federal government to help producers, she added, noting they don't address issues stemming from the H1N1 virus, which will be discussed in an upcoming meeting of agriculture ministers.</p>
<p>"What I'm looking for from the hog industry is some ideas of how we can assist them in the short-term and the long-term," she said.</p>
<p>Gough said the current programs don't help because they pay farmers on the average of what they made for the past five years.</p>
<p>"We haven't made any money for five years, so there's no average to work with," he said.</p>

<p>The number of cases of H1N1 human swine flu on Vancouver Island continues to grow, mostly on the southern portion of the Island.</p>
<p>Figures released by the Vancouver Island Health Authority yesterday show confirmed Island H1N1 cases have climbed to 36. Twenty-five are from the south Island, seven from the central Island and three from the north Island. One patient appears to have gone missing.</p>
<p>Last week, an H1N1 patient in Nanaimo required intensive-care treatment in hospital, a first for the Vancouver Island Health Authority. The woman was only the second of 20 patients hospitalized so far in B.C. who required a ventilator.</p>
<p>The number of confirmed cases in B.C. is now 298, up from 270 earlier in the week. Nationally, the number now exceeds 8,500, up from just below 8,000.</p>
<p>A vaccine for the flu is expected by early November.</p>

<p>Since its opening last week, camp counsellors at New Jersey's Liberty Lake Day Camp disinfect door knobs, take the temperatures of children as they arrive and remind the campers not to share canned sodas. Many of the 12,000-plus summer camps in the U.S. are ramping up efforts to guard against the spread of the H1N1 swine flu. While H1N1 influenza has caused mild symptoms that go away without medication in most patients, it has killed 170 people in the U.S. and more than 300 globally. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says at least one million Americans are likely infected. Swine flu outbreaks have prompted temporary closing of Indiana-based Camp Livingston, a YMCA day camp in West Virginia, and all of the Muscular Dystrophy Association's summer programs.</p>

<p>The federal government said yesterday that Russia has agreed to lift restrictions imposed because of the swine-flu scare on the import of certain meat products from Quebec and Ontario.</p>
<p>According to a joint statement from the International Trade and Agriculture Canada departments, Russia has lifted H1N1-related restrictions on pork and pork products from Quebec produced before June 2 and after June 30. Russia also lifted restrictions against some Ontario products, including beef and poultry.</p>
<p>International Trade Minister Stockwell Day and Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said some countries continue to impose restrictions on Canadian pork and swine, including China and Ukraine, without "scientifically justifiable evidence" to support their actions.</p>

<p>Since its opening last week, camp counsellors at New Jersey's Liberty Lake Day Camp disinfect door knobs, take the temperatures of children as they arrive and remind the campers not to share sodas. Many of the 12,000-plus summer camps in the United States are ramping up their efforts to guard against the spread of the new H1N1 swine flu.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Hog farmers say they are losing thousands of dollars and considering euthanizing healthy pigs because they are battling bankruptcy without government aid.</p>
<p>Dozens of farmers -- with 50 pigs -- gathered at the provincial legislature yesterday to protest what they call government inaction in the face of a crisis that has been growing for years and worsened by fears around swine flu.</p>
<p>"We're just digging the hole deeper,'' said John Gough, who has a 300-sow operation in Mount Brydges. "Country logic would say if you get in a hole, quit digging. Well, we can't quit digging. Are we going to let them starve?''</p>
<p>Gough said farmers are losing about $50 a pig as they try to feed and raise hogs for slaughter.</p>
<p>Eric Reymer, 35, of Woodham fears he will be forced to euthanize 2,000 20-day-old weaner pigs by Monday if he can't find a buyer for the animals because he can't afford to keep them -- a move that would cost him roughly $70,000.</p>
<p>Like other protesters, Reymer said high feed costs, safety concerns after the H1N1 virus was dubbed the "swine flu,'' and U.S. legislation making it impossible to send pork to that country for processing are making it impossible to turn a profit.</p>
<p>Pigs are selling for about $5 to $7, when the cost of production is $34 to $36, he said.</p>

<p>Economy</p>
<p>Unemployment to rise after rebound: Flaherty</p>
<p>Finance Minister Jim Flaherty now expects Canada's economic recovery to be modest and for job losses to mount into 2010 even after growth has begun.</p>
<p>Responding to surprisingly high job losses reported in the United States on Thursday, Flaherty warned that while the economy may be in the process of stabilizing, labour markets are not.</p>
<p>"We'll start to see stabilization, which we are seeing now, and then a return to economic growth but continuing deterioration in employment," he said after meeting with finance ministers from the Americas in Chile.</p>

<p>Russia eases pork ban</p>
<p>Russia has partly lifted its ban on Canadian pork, easing a major trade impediment that has been straining Canada's pork industry since the outbreak of H1N1 flu in April. Effective June 30, Russia lifted H1N1-related restrictions on Quebec pork and pork products produced before June 2 and after June 30.</p>
<p>The ban remains in place on uncooked pork from Ontario because of the prevalence of the H1N1 virus in humans in Canada's most populous province, said Jacques Pomerleau, executive director of Canada Pork International, a marketing agency.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Death caused by H1N1; Woman, 41, had other health issues: coroner</b>
</div><div>Carmela Fragomeni   </div>

</p>
<p>Hamilton's associate medical officer says a coroner has determined H1N1 was the primary cause of death in a 41-year-old city woman who died earlier this week.</p>
<p>Dr. Chris Mackie said the coroner was called to rule on the death and decided it was not a coroner's case and an autopsy was not needed. Mackie said he ruled the cause of death was acute respiratory distress syndrome, which in this case is H1N1.</p>
<p>The cause of death ruling does not increase public health department concerns over the continuing H1N1 virus spreading in the community because the woman had other underlying health problems, he said.</p>
<p>"We know it (H1N1 and other flus) can cause death in people with suppressed immune systems and this just played itself out in real life," he said.</p>
<p>Mackie would not say what the other illnesses were, for privacy reasons.</p>
<p>The woman died in hospital but did not acquire the H1N1 swine flu there, said Mary Catharine Orvidas, infection control practitioner at <span class="companylink">Hamilton Health Sciences</span>.</p>
<p>Orvidas said ever since Ontario experienced SARS, the hospital has been screening respiratory illnesses as patients come in and as soon as a patient is identified, he or she is put in isolation -- as happened in this case.</p>
<p>Mackie said earlier this week that in cases such as this, where a patient already has an existing illness, death is not unexpected.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada says there has been 661 H1N1 hospitalizations and 33 deaths.</p>

<p>Oil brokerage loses $10M</p>
<p>LONDON -- PVM Oil Associates, the world's biggest over-the-counter oil brokerage, says it lost nearly $10 million this week because of unauthorized trades that caused a temporary spike in Brent crude markets.</p>
<p>PVM said in a statement late Thursday that it was investigating the trades, which drove up the price of Brent futures by more than $2 in one hour Tuesday. It did not identify the trader involved in the transactions.</p>
<p>ICE Futures Europe, the exchange that handled the trades, said Friday such incidents would be investigated as a matter of course, but declined to comment specifically on this case.</p>
<p>The Financial Times reported that futures contracts for 16 million barrels of oil changed hands in one hour, compared to a typical volume of 500,000 barrels.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Girl's death ignites hospital debate; Lingering mistrust and long wait times mean some residents avoid Brampton Civic</b>

<div>750 words</div><div>3 July 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT03</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star </div>
</p>
<p>Two weeks after her 6-year-old daughter suddenly died, Kuldip Thindal is haunted by two questions:</p>
<p>Would Ruby have survived if Kuldip had called 911?</p>
<p>And what if she had taken Ruby to Brampton Civic instead of Georgetown Hospital?</p>
<p>Brampton Civic is about 15 kilometres from the Thindals' home; Georgetown Hospital is roughly 21 kilometres away. Thindal took Ruby to Georgetown on June 15 when she complained of a tummy ache. The little girl died in the back seat of the car, minutes from the hospital.</p>
<p>Doctors told Ruby's parents later she had the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>"Our family has always gone to Georgetown Hospital," Thindal said. "It takes way too long at Brampton (Civic) and I feel more comfortable (at Georgetown)."</p>
<p>Wait times for ER are longer at Brampton Civic but that's not the only reason many in the city, specifically in the Punjabi community, are wary of the hospital. When it opened about 18 months ago, two patients died within a few weeks amid allegations they had been misdiagnosed and mistreated.</p>
<p>Amid street protests, Ontario appointed a supervisor to restore public confidence in the hospital. Three top executives at the facility resigned.</p>
<p>"Things at Brampton Civic are getting better," said Jagtar Shergill, a member of Brampton Health Coalition. "The wait times are getting shorter and the staff is more understanding to patients' needs. But there's lingering mistrust from months ago."</p>
<p>Though the cause of Ruby Thindal's death is still unknown, it spurred another round of debate about Brampton Civic's often thorny relationship with the people it serves.</p>
<p>"It's sad but that's the way it is," said Yadevinder "Nick" Mutta, a musician who lives in Brampton.</p>
<p>When his wife, Natasha, was bruised in a melee at a bar last week, she went to Georgetown Hospital. "She was back (home) within three hours," he said.</p>
<p>At Brampton Civic, he says, it would have taken twice, or even three times as long.</p>
<p>Mutta, who has kidney problems, is a regular visitor to hospitals. He says he always goes first to Georgetown Hospital.</p>
<p>The wait times, staff attitude and lingering mistrust are some reasons why people avoid Brampton Civic, said Mutta.</p>
<p>According to the Ontario Ministry of Health, there was an average 17.5-hour wait time for patients with complex conditions at the emergency room of Brampton Civic in February, the latest available data. The hours indicate the complete length of stay in emergency.</p>
<p>The provincial target is 13.6 hours.</p>
<p>More than 7,190 visits, the highest among hospitals in the area, were recorded.</p>
<p>The wait time at the Georgetown Hospital for the same period is 6.3 hours. There were almost 2,350 visits to the ER.</p>
<p>Dr. Naveed Mohammad, chief of emergency medicine for William Osler Health System, of which Brampton Civic is a part, said it was tragic the little girl died, but "she sounded really sick. I don't know if she could have been saved at any other hospital."</p>
<p>Mohammad says lingering doubts about the hospital's efficacy bothered him at one time. "Now I just see our volumes going through the roof," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>"Yes, there are some people who continue to be misinformed but we've launched diversity programs and have made inroads. Otherwise, we wouldn't have such a high volume of patients," he said.</p>
<p>He pointed out that Brampton Civic's times are better than Credit Valley Hospital at 18.5 and Trillium Health Centre at 24.4.</p>
<p>That doesn't help patients, says Balwinder Tamber, who lives near Gore Rd. and Highway 10 in Brampton.</p>
<p>When his 2-year-old daughter started vomiting last month, the family took her to Brampton Civic. Almost 12 hours later, a doctor hadn't seen her. Eventually, Tamber took her home and they went to a walk-in clinic the next day.</p>
<p>Tamber says if he is in a similar predicament again, he will go south of the border.</p>
<p>"I'll have to pay for the services but at least I'll have a doctor. I'll be in and out in 15 minutes. Brampton Civic? I don't think so."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health officials say strike hindering swine-flu work; With pandemic planning on hold, some wonder if city will be ready for more serious outbreak</b>
</div><div>Theresa Boyle </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>547 words</div><div>3 July 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT02</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star </div>
</p>
<p>Public health officials are concerned that the Toronto civic workers' strike is hobbling pandemic planning efforts for the fall, when it's feared swine flu may get worse.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt in my mind (that) this is a very inopportune time to have a strike. In terms of pandemic planning, we have a lot of work to do and this will hinder that work," said Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious disease prevention and control for the Ontario Agency for Health Promotion and Protection.</p>
<p>Ontario's 36 public health units are - or should be - in the process of planning for the establishment of mass vaccination and flu assessment centres in the fall. While the province has not given the final word on whether these centres will open, public health units have been ordered to make plans.</p>
<p>Toronto has seen the most H1N1 influenza virus activity of any public health unit in the province. According to the latest numbers, the city has had 1,328 of the province's 3,154 cases. There are 21 patients with the virus in Toronto hospitals.</p>
<p>Dozens of front-line staff from Toronto Public Health are now on the picket line. They include nurses, epidemiologists, health promotion consultants and data-entry administrators - staff who would normally be involved in setting up these centres, as well as "contact tracing" to determine how the infection is moving from person to person.</p>
<p>"There is still so much work to be done, so you can imagine that if we do have a strike for a long period, it's not going to be helpful," Gardam said.</p>
<p>Flu assessment centres would be open to those who think they might have the virus. Individuals would be assessed by health professionals who could dispense antiviral medication, which must be taken within 48 hours of getting symptoms.</p>
<p>"You may not get the drug to people within 48 hours. Public response isn't going to be as good as you'd like it to be," Gardam said.</p>
<p>Public health units normally set up vaccination clinics for regular seasonal flu, but this year they will have to do three times as much work because Ontarians are being urged to also get an H1N1 vaccination and H1N1 booster.</p>
<p>"We've got lots to do, man. We've go to sort out these things. Having a plan on paper is not the same as operationalizing it."</p>
<p>A source with the city who is not on strike agrees with Gardam's concerns.</p>
<p>"What if it (virus) changes and we're not on top of it?" the source said, adding that managers have been working 12- to 14-hour days and are getting burned out.</p>
<p>Even educational efforts have been hampered, the source said, noting that posters offering tips on handwashing and sneezing into your sleeve have not been sent to summer camps as planned.</p>
<p>There have been 77,000 confirmed cases of the virus worldwide so far. There is concern it could mutate and cause more serious illness. Genetic mutations resistant to antiviral medication have already been found in Japan and Denmark.</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- The H1N1 virus is moving quickly through the southern hemisphere, even as it continues to spread though northern countries, including Canada, where preparations are being made for a potentially more deadly surge this fall.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and David Butler Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, are in Mexico this week to confer with their international colleagues about mounting a global effort to defend against the disease.</p>
<p>More than 100 countries are reporting cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>Mexico, where the virus was discovered and where it has claimed the most lives, is experiencing a resurgence of cases after a brief lull. And other southern countries, including Chile, Argentina and Australia, are dealing with climbing infection rates and mounting death tolls.</p>
<p>Developing countries have asked wealthier nations, including Canada, for assistance with providing antivirals such as Tamiflu and vaccines, Ms. Aglukkaq told Canadian reporters during a teleconference yesterday.</p>
<p>Although the United States has said it will give 420,000 Tamiflu treatments to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) to be distributed in Latin America and the Caribbean, the Canadian government will not act until it receives a formal request for help, Ms. Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>But “this H1N1 is only the beginning,” she said. “We need to remain concerned about it. We need to remain vigilant because we do not know how it will come out in the fall and we need to prepare how we deal with that internationally.”</p>
<p>Worldwide, there were 332 deaths and more than 77,000 confirmed cases as of Wednesday, according to the latest figures available from the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Some experts have said Canada is the hardest hit country to date, with 20 cases of H1N1 per 100,000 population. By comparison, the rate per 100,000 is 7.1 in Mexico, 7.1 in the United States and 4.6 in Britain.</p>
<p>Dr. Butler-Jones warned reporters to be “very suspicious” about using that kind of number to judge the severity of the outbreak. “It may simply be that we have tested a larger percentage of the total number of cases and nothing to do with what's underlying that in terms of illness in the community,” he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'Swine-flu parties' rejected by experts; Idea stems from 'pox parties'</b>

</p>
<p>Health experts are throwing cold water on Internet-based discussions suggesting "swine-flu parties" as a way to build immunity in children in case the virus mutates into something more severe.</p>
<p>The idea of bringing children with the flu together with others is "a very dangerous practice," Canada's chief public health officer, David Butler-Jones, said yesterday. While most infections so far have caused mild disease, "you cannot predict which child will get seriously ill and die," he said from Mexico.</p>
<p>"Who wants to have that party and have that as a consequence?"</p>
<p>Reports have surfaced of people discussing, in online forums, plans for swine-flu parties. The parties are based on the belief that, if a person gets a mild version of the virus now, he or she may become less likely to contract a more deadly strain in the next wave of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The idea stems from "pox parties" that were popular before a chickenpox vaccine became available. The idea was to expose children to chickenpox in an attempt to give them immunity to the disease, reducing their risk of getting chickenpox when they were older, when symptoms can be much worse.</p>
<p>Health experts say the idea of throwing a swine-flu party with the same goal in mind is just a bad idea. "I've got two kids. I would not expose them to this virus," says Dr. David Patrick, director of epidemiology at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>So far, from a genetic standpoint, the virus appears to be more or less stable, he says. It would take a significant genetic change to increase virulence, "and that typically doesn't happen too fast."</p>
<p>"We're well along in terms of vaccine production, so it's very likely that, by the fall, or at least the late fall, vaccine will be available for Canadians against this strain, which will be a much preferred option than taking the risk of exposing your kid to a live infection," Patrick says.</p>
<p>In May, Richard Besser, the acting head of the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, warned against deliberately exposing people to the virus. And one of the people in charge of fighting Toronto's SARS outbreak questions why any parent would want to take the risk.</p>
<p>"That you would deliberately take a risk with your child now, because it might avoid a theoretical risk in the future, seem like really odd behaviour, because that's what you're doing," says Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Britain fears 100,000 new cases of swine flu a day; 'Cases are doubling every week,' says health secretary</b>
</div><div>TRUDY HARRIS   </div>
<div>AFP</div>
<div>725 words</div><div>3 July 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Britain's health secretary warned yesterday the country could soon face more than 100,000 daily cases of swine flu, while fears linked to the virus soared in Argentina after the death toll nearly doubled.</p>
<p>The warning from British Health Secretary Andy Burnham came as a second case of resistance to the key Tamiflu drug in a swine flu patient emerged in less than a week, with the latest in Japan.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus has also now spread to all 27 countries in the European Union, with Malta reporting its first two cases.</p>
<p>Burnham said 100,000 cases a day could occur in Britain by the end of August if the current rate of infection is maintained.</p>
<p>Britain already has Europe's highest number of reported cases.</p>
<p>"Cases are doubling every week, and on this trend we could see over 100,000 cases a day by the end of August, but I stress this is only a projection," Burnham told the House of Commons, the lower parliamentary chamber.</p>
<p>Britain now has nearly 7,500 cases of swine flu, he said, with hundreds of new cases being confirmed every day.</p>
<p>Health officials have said Britain is abandoning a policy of trying to stop the flu spreading and instead focusing on patients most susceptible to it, such as obese people or those suffering from asthma or breathing problems.</p>
<p>All three people who have died in Britain after contracting swine flu had underlying health problems, health officials have said.</p>
<p>The latest numbers from the World Health Organization, released on Wednesday, showed 77,201 reported swine flu cases worldwide, with 332 deaths.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Japan's health ministry reported resistance to Tamiflu in a patient with swine flu, the second in a week after a previous case in Denmark.</p>
<p>The patient - a woman in Osaka prefecture - was recovering after having been given Ralenza, an alternative anti-flu medication, Kyodo news agency reported, citing the Health, Welfare and Labour Ministry.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Roche, which makes Tamiflu, said the company had been informed of the case and called it "normal," adding that "0.4 per cent of adults develop resistance" to Tamiflu.</p>
<p>This case did not indicate Tamiflu has become less effective against swine flu, she added.</p>
<p>Separately, the U.S. health department said it would provide 420,000 courses of Tamiflu to fight swine flu in Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Argentina has surpassed Canada (25 deaths) as the country with the most swine flu-linked deaths after the United States and Mexico, and the government there has come under fire for its response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Swine flu fears in Argentina have been aggravated by the government's refusal to declare a state of emergency even as the death toll has increased to at least 43 from 26.</p>
<p>New Health Minister Juan Manzur avoided precise numbers at his first press conference Wednesday, finally settling on "between 43 and 44" as the number of deaths.</p>
<p>The virus spread in Argentina at a time when the government and public were distracted by a campaign for mid-term legislative elections held Sunday.</p>
<p>But fears over flu have increased since the weekend, as public and media attention has shifted from politics to the mounting number of deaths and infections.</p>
<p>On Monday, pharmacies in Argentina ran out of masks, as advice about how to avoid the flu replaced the drama of President Cristina Kirchner's electoral defeat as the top topic of conversation.</p>
<p>In Australia yesterday, authorities said parents should not panic after the death of a 3-year-old with swine flu - its first child death linked to the virus.</p>
<p>Health Minister Nicola Roxon called the death a "tragedy," but emphasized that the virus was mild in most cases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the UN World Tourism Organization has revised its 2009 global tourism forecast sharply down because of the worsening economic outlook and uncertainty over swine flu.</p>
<p>The body forecast that international tourism would decrease between four and six per cent this year.</p>

<p>Dr. Michael Gracey, a medical adviser to Unity of First People of Australia, an aboriginal non-profit organization, and the author of a study to be published in the next issue of the medical journal Lancet, suggests that the world's almost 400 million indigenous peoples -- including about 1.2 million in Canada -- are particularly at risk for contracting swine flu because they often live in remote, impoverished communities with limited access to medical infrastructure.</p>
<p>First Nations communities in Manitoba and northern Ontario have already been hit by the highly communicable H1N1 virus.</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- Public health officials are alarmed at tales that people are considering throwing "swine flu parties," hoping to catch the potentially deadly virus.</p>
<p>The British media have been circulating stories that some people with H1N1 influenza are inviting friends over to spread their illness, and that parents are holding swine flu parties to immunize their children against the virus now before it gets worse in wintertime.</p>
<p>"That's a very dangerous practice," said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>"The problem is that while it may be true that for the majority it is a mild disease, you cannot predict which child will get seriously ill and die," said Butler-Jones, who remembered parents throwing chicken pox parties when he was a kid with a similar goal in mind. "Who wants to have that party and have that as a consequence?"</p>
<p>The flu parties are hardly on their way to becoming a global craze.</p>
<p>Talk of the so-called trend intensified after BBC News ran a story that had the British Medical Association coming out against the bashes.</p>
<p>"I have heard reports of people throwing swine flu parties. I don't think that's a good idea," said Dr. Richard Jarvis, chair of the association's public health committee.</p>
<p>The online report ended by asking anyone planning a swine flu party to drop the BBC a note, but it appears that so far no video cameras have captured anyone handing out antiviral drugs as party favours.</p>
<p>Justine Roberts, a mother of four in North London who runs a popular parenting website called Mumsnet, said a BBC reporter phoned to ask if she had heard of anyone throwing a party.</p>
<p>"There have ... been conversations (on the website discussion board) where people were saying, 'Oh no, someone in my class has got swine flu,' and the response was, 'Give me their number. I'll come around right now,' but I never came across one single instance of someone saying, 'Come to my house at 3 o'clock. We're having a swine flu party," she said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>New Zealander Stephen Heise said the swine flu party he publicized on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> was just a joke.</p>
<p>"(It) is just satire, poking fun at some of the hype and hysteria surrounding the swine flu."</p>
<p>But Londoner Tony Howell, who also started a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> group about the idea, said he had seriously thought about it when someone he knew became exposed to the virus.</p>
<p>"A relative of mine was sent home from school as two teachers were thought to have swine flu. So I tried organizing a party with the relative in case they had it, but they have now been given the all clear."</p>
<p>Howell said he is watching to see if anyone actually throws a party. "If so, I'm there."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tiny Tots centre open again, but problem remains: Burko; Clinic refused 3,000 patients in June after doctors reached their billing ceiling</b>
</div><div>The Gazette</div>
<div>498 words</div><div>2 July 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>F8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>The Tiny Tots Medical Centre in Dollard des Ormeaux resumed regular hours yesterday, but the centre's director warns that the problem of staff shortage because of government regulations has not gone away - in fact, said Dr. Benjamin Burko, it will likely recur in November.</p>
<p>The medical centre, which serves newborns to 18-year-olds, had to turn away about 3,000 patients in June because some of the 25 doctors at the centre had hit a government-imposed billing ceiling, meaning they would not get full pay for their work.</p>
<p>As well, according to government rules, general practitioners who work at private clinics must work 12 hours a week at a different location, such as hospital emergency wards.</p>
<p>That is why, explained Burko, the centre had requested special medical activity certification - Activités Médicales Particulières (AMP) - meaning the doctors could do their weekly 12 hours at the Tiny Tots centre itself.</p>
<p>But that request, like all previous requests for AMP status, was rejected.</p>
<p>"It is beyond me how the decision-makers at the Montreal Regional Department of General Medicine (DRMG) - which is responsible for network access to general medical care - would not grant AMP admissibility to our centre, which is doing front-line emergency care year-round," Burko said, adding that hospital ER's would be getting even more patients if it wasn't for the services of Tiny Tots.</p>
<p>The Tiny Tots clinic is open 365 days a year, from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays and from 9 to 5 p.m. on weekends.</p>
<p>Burko said part of the reason his staff went beyond billing ceilings last month was because many more patients than usual came to the clinic as fears of the H1N1 flu virus spread.</p>
<p>"We were each seeing an extra 10 to 20 patients a day over and above the 30 to 35 patients we see on a regular basis."</p>
<p>H1N1 notwithstanding, Burko said the problem of staff shortage will hit again.</p>
<p>"The problem resurfaces periodically, as we hit our billing ceilings," he said. "Now it will likely happen again in November as another billing cycle comes to an end.</p>
<p>Burko will continue to request AMP admissibility for the clinic and noted many patients are voicing their concerns.</p>
<p>"More than 800 patients have emailed the ministry of health and the DRMG detailing their individual stories of where they had to go for urgent care when we were closed," he said.</p>
<p>Officials at the DRMG referred calls to the Quebec Health Department. Dominique Breton, a spokesperson for the health department, said AMP's are granted to individual doctors - general practitioners in fact - and not to clinics or specialists.</p>
<p>She added, however, that the ministry is seeking advice from the Quebec College of Physicians.</p>
<p>"We have asked the (Quebec) College of Physicians for their opinion," Breton said.</p>

</p>
<p>"Ya gonna paint the porch?" said a man who lives down the street.</p>
<p>"Yup."</p>
<p>"That's a big project."</p>
<p>"Yup."</p>
<p>It gets bigger every day. Between spending time with loved ones and friends, blogging and podcasting, trying to get in some exercise, two bouts of the flu (please, let one of them be swine flu so I don't have to go through that again) and just workaday stuff, the porch-painting extravaganza is six weeks old. I'm so frazzled I left the front door wide open when I left for work the other day, only to be saved by a neighbour who keeps one of my extra keys.</p>
<p>Now the Ottawa jazz festival is taking up evenings. The porch painting could rival the half-century the National Capital Commission is taking to redevelop LeBreton Flats.</p>
<p>A school of thought on neighbourhood design says the front porch is critical to building a sense of community. People sit on their porches to read or talk. The front stoop puts eyes on the street, creating safer residential areas.</p>
<p>It's true. My neighbour Kelly brings his laptop out in the evenings to read or he quietly plays his guitar on the front step. I can't open a book on the porch without getting into a conversation with the neighbours.</p>
<p>But paint your porch and it becomes a sense of community on steroids. All this starts with my not really knowing what I'm doing, so I walk a couple of doors down to talk to Donna who works in a Bells Corners paint shop. She surveys the peeling, cracking paint and the bare patch where I replaced the rotting footings of a porch post (the NCC would call this a study and consultation).</p>
<p>So Donna brings home some of the most luxurious paint I've ever seen -- thick, silky, a joy with which to work -- some outstanding brushes and lends me her steel-graphite scraper. Preparation is 90 per cent of painting, I'm told, so I start hacking at the porch and railings with the little tool. The porch extends across the front of my 90-year-old house, so scraping it down is rather like filling the Grand Canyon with a spoon.</p>
<p>But here is where the interesting part begins. Start any renovation in the old west end (the renovation capital of Ottawa) and all your neighbours visit. They haven't come to compliment me on my clothes -- old, ripped, paint-splattered shorts and T-shirt, an ugly hat I got free from someone promoting Spanish clementines at a food and wine show ("hey, I could use that for painting").</p>
<p>Leo and Franco, who know much more about this than I, come by with some advice and encouragement. Gilles next door tells me I've missed a spot. Kathleen across the street points out the front porch sure looks ugly with no paint on it (it's true). And I waddle down the street to see David and Vivian's brand new car. Strangers tell me the porch is looking good: "It refreshes it." Journalist and former cellmate in the municipal bureau Juliet O'Neill and her beau, James, drop by "wondering if Ken was on the front porch." While all this is going on, my little solar-powered radio blares out the baseball game and I rediscover the joy of rounders via the spoken word -- the music of summer.</p>
<p>There is a point to all this porch banter. When I walked down Richmond Road to Westfest recently, I noticed how my neighbourhood had changed, not for the better. Old, useful businesses had been usurped by the trendy. The classic Canadian Tire and gas bar are two enormous bomb craters with all the intimacy of 1946 Berlin. Tall condos and apartments are springing up through the neighbourhood like toadstools after a rainstorm. The only sense of community you get in those is when you pound on the ceiling of your unit with a broomstick, yelling that seven hours of hip-hop on the upstairs stereo is enough. Not long ago architect Barry Hobin told the Citizen editorial board that Richmond Road will become the destination shopping area of Ottawa in 10 years. But will it be a working neighbourhood? A community?</p>
<p>Intensification and the urban boundary are vital to the future of our community. They are green, cost-saving measures. But there is collateral damage. The old west end, the incubator of the new Ottawa, is losing its neighbourhood character, warmth and appeal because of faceless apartments and condos. And if our country is a community of communities, this is something worth considering on Canada Day.</p>
<p>"You still painting that porch?" said a woman I've never met before as she passes my house.</p>
<p>"Yup."</p>

<p>Anti-gang law upheld</p>
<p>in case of former bikers</p>
<p>The Ontario Court of Appeal has dismissed a constitutional challenge to Canada's anti-gang law, upholding the convictions of two former Hells Angels found guilty of committing extortion "in association with" a criminal organization.</p>
<p>Steven Lindsay and Raymond Bonner argued the law was unconstitutionally vague and minor criminals or innocent people could be subject to its harsh penalties.</p>
<p>But the three-judge panel disagreed and supported a 2005 ruling that said the law didn't have to set "precise parameters."</p>

<p>Who is a Canadian?</p>
<p>Look in the mirror. Next question.</p>
<p>Our better beaver</p>
<p>“There is not that much physical difference between the [Canadian] and European beaver,” The Independent reported last year, “except for the formation of some of the nasal bones – and you're unlikely to get close enough to either type of beaver to see that. The European beaver prefers to make its home in burrowed-out sections of the river bank, but it will also live in lodges of piled-up logs where a burrow isn't available, while the [Canadian] beaver is more likely to live in a free-standing lodge. The European beaver will also build fewer dams than its [Canadian] cousin, and usually in shallow streams to maintain water levels above the entrance to its burrow. The [Canadian] beaver is a better builder and is heavier, but tends to be smaller than the European.”</p>
<p>Our citizenship test?</p>
<p>Last year, author Kevin Callan explained to Explore magazine how to make love in a canoe. His advice included:</p>
<p>• Choose a romantic setting. The best time is under a starlit sky and the best place is in the middle of a calm lake.</p>
<p>• Create the proper mood by lighting candle lanterns at bow and stern.</p>
<p>• For extra comfort, place a sleeping pad in the bottom of the canoe.</p>
<p>• Take off all necessary clothing, especially footwear – bare feet ensure a better grip.</p>
<p>• Assume the position of your choice.</p>
<p>• End with a quick skinny dip to cool down.</p>

Men agree on the answer but women don't,” Kate Melville writes at Scienceagogo.com. “So says a new study from Wake Forest University psychologists that found there is much more consensus among men about whom they find attractive than there is among women.” The study, led by Dustin Wood and reported in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, involved more than 4,000 participants who rated photographs. “Men's judgments of women's attractiveness were based primarily around physical features and they rated highly those who looked thin and seductive. Most of the men in the study also rated photographs of women who looked confident as more attractive,” Ms. Melville writes. “As a group, the women rating men showed some preference for thin, muscular subjects, but disagreed on how attractive many men in the study were. Some women gave high attractiveness ratings to the men other women said were not attractive at all.”</p>
<p>Blame your bliss point</p>
<p>“Junk foods such as Snickers bars and ketchup really are irresistible,” Jonathan Leake reports in The Sunday Times of London. “Manufacturers have created combinations of fat, sugar and salt that are so tasty many people cannot stop eating them even when full, according to America's former food standards watchdog. David Kessler, former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, has warned that snacks, cereals and ready meals devised by food scientists can act on the reward centres of the brain in the same way as tobacco. He argues that manufacturers are seeking to trigger a ‘bliss point' when people eat certain products, leaving them hungry for more. ‘It is time to stop blaming individuals for being overweight or obese,' said Kessler. ‘… For millions of people, modern food is simply impossible to resist.' ”</p>

<p>“Throwing ‘swine flu parties' in an attempt to get immunity against the virus while it is a fairly mild form is not a good idea, doctors say. Reports have emerged of people intentionally mixing with friends who have flu. Their reasoning is that it is best to be infected before the winter when the virus could become more deadly,” BBC News reports. “But public-health expert Dr. Richard Jarvis said such behaviour could undermine the fight against swine flu. … ‘It is quite a mild virus, but people still get ill and there is a risk of mortality.' ” Furthermore, he noted, the country's so-far-successful strategy of containment, buying time until a vaccine is developed, would be undermined.</p>
<p>Caught with a hot snake</p>
<p>A stolen snake was found in Australia – after it ate an endangered marsupial fitted with a tracking device, Ananova.com reports. The two-metre-long carpet python was taken by thieves from a research centre near Perth just after it had eaten the woylie, which is a small mammal. After picking up the signal from the air, scientists and police tracked it on foot to a house in Heathridge, local media reported. “It's fair to say the people were shocked when we turned up,” Sergeant Damian Ellson said “They had no idea the snake had a tracking device inside its stomach.”</p>
