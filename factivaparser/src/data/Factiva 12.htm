<p>Tomorrow is the last day for H1N1 vaccination clinics in Hamilton, as the pandemic flu continues to drastically decline here.</p>
<p>Only 9 per cent of Hamiltonians with flu-like symptoms tested last week have H1N1.</p>
<p>That is down from 17 per cent the week before, and 34 per cent the week before that.</p>
<p>At the peak of the pandemic during the last week of October, 48 per cent of people with flu-like symptoms tested had H1N1.</p>
<p>"In the past two weeks, the percent of positivity has plummeted back to normal levels," said Dr. Chris Mackie, a Hamilton associate medical officer of health. "At 9 per cent we still have a higher rate of influenza than expected for this time of year, but this is much more in line with what we would expect in a community outbreak of influenza."</p>
<p>Normally about 20 to 25 per cent of tests are positive for influenza A during the peak of seasonal flu. But the peak is usually in the winter, not the fall. Positive tests are typically zero to five per cent at this time of year.</p>
<p>The current 9 per cent is still high compared to that, but is dropping steadily. Mackie expects the outbreak to be over in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>As a result, Hamilton's last H1N1 flu shot clinics are at Jackson Square today from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. and tomorrow from noon until 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Halton vaccination clinics are continuing until Dec. 14. They are providing both seasonal and H1N1 shots.</p>
<p>Mackie still recommends getting the shot as H1N1 winds down.</p>
<p>It will still be available at doctors' offices, walk-in clinics and by appointment at public health's regularly scheduled vaccination clinics after tomorrow.</p>
<p>"It remains appropriate to get the shot," said Mackie. "However, it is not as critical at this point as it was when the vaccine was first offered to the general public in Hamilton in mid November."</p>

<p>This year it's not the Grinch, but the flu who stole Christmas.</p>
<p>Santa Claus won't be making any in-person visits to patients at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario this season over fears of spreading the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>But the kids at CHEO, which has 156 beds, won't be completely left out in the cold. Children will be able to receive a personalized message from the jolly man in red, delivered online through the “Portable North Pole,” an Internet-based application launched by Sympatico.ca and UgroupMedia.</p>
<p>Santa usually visits children in each room to ask what they want for Christmas. But as the second wave of the H1N1 pandemic began to sweep across Canada, officials began to worry about the possibility that St. Nick could pass the flu virus around the hospital.</p>
<p>“It's a cross-contamination issue,” said Marie Belanger, media relations and events specialist at the Ottawa hospital. “We just couldn't have Santa visiting from room to room.”</p>
<p>CHEO is trying to restrict all visitors during the pandemic and are urging those exhibiting symptoms to stay home.</p>
<p>Ms. Belanger said the hospital will still have other Christmas-themed activities, programs and crafts to bring the holiday spirit to patients.</p>
<p>While other children's hospitals in Canada are on high alert for infection outbreaks and are emphasizing the importance of hand-washing, not everyone is closing the doors to Mr. Claus.</p>
<p>At the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Santa will be on hand in mid-December to greet and pose for photographs. He'll also make an appearance Christmas morning, when families of many patients gather at the hospital. Similar to CHEO, Sick Kids also has a variety of other holiday-themed activities planned.</p>
<p>“We want to be child- and family-centred,” said Margaret Keatings, chief nurse executive and chief of interprofessional practice at Sick Kids. “We know these events are really important to them.”</p>
<p>But the decision to go ahead with regularly scheduled holiday activities wasn't made lightly, Ms. Keatings added.</p>
<p>“We definitely had a very in-depth discussion with our infection control team,” she said. “We definitely wanted to put in a balanced approach.”</p>
<p>That means hospital staff will be even more vigilant than usual about infection control, ensuring patients and their families exercise good hygiene and avoid coming into the hospital if they are sick.</p>
<p>Santa won't be making an appearance at the B.C. Children's Hospital this year, but it has nothing to do with H1N1. Rather, the Mr. and Mrs. Claus who used to visit the hospital each year have recently retired.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Best Pageant even better; Kids of Kaleidoscope present a Christmas favourite with a few topical twists</b>
</div><div>Adrian Chamberlain   </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>

</p>
<p>The Best Christmas Pageant Ever is about to get better.</p>
<p>So says Leslie Bland. He's directing Barbara Robinson's popular stage comedy, opening Saturday at the McPherson Playhouse.</p>
<p>The play, mounted by Bland's Kaleidoscope Theatre, was performed by the company eight years ago. This time the company boasts a larger budget. And Bland says he's pleasantly surprised at how talented the new crop of young performers is.</p>
<p>"I think this production will be a lot stronger," he said.</p>
<p>The Best Christmas Pageant Ever is acted by 37 members of Kaleidoscope's Young Company, aged seven to 16. They perform with professional adult actors such as Gina McIntosh and Judith McDowell, who reprise the respective roles of Grace Bradley and Mrs. Armstrong. The adult cast also includes Roderick Glanville, Michael Shewchuk, Alexander Ferguson, Christina Patterson, Jane Broomfield and Jeni Gunn.</p>
<p>Originally a 1972 book before being adapted for stage and TV in the '80s, The Best Christmas Pageant Ever has been updated with topical twists.</p>
<p>For instance, there's now a humorous passing reference to swine flu in the show. As well, Bland and Ferguson wrote the lyrics and music for a new hip-hop number book-ending the play. The song introduces the Herdmans, a delinquent gaggle of children who disrupt a choir practice.</p>
<p>Bland recited part of the rap: "Hey all you churchies, my brother he is Ralph. The teacher's always sayin' he's got such a bad mouth."</p>
<p>Directing 37 children sounds like a handful. But Bland, who directed children's theatre in Edmonton before becoming artistic director of Kaleidoscope, says the hurdle is far from insurmountable. While he's forced to assume the "bad cop" role at times, Bland -- who's also an actor -- tries to make rehearsal fun by demonstrating what he's asking for.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper will be going to the Copenhagen climate conference after all -- an announcement delivered last week, by uncanny coincidence, in the middle of a major speech on the environment by Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff.</p>
<p>So if Copenhagen accomplishes nothing else, it has at least captured the restless attention of our political leaders. And that is good, because while controversy over Afghan detainees has become old news, and the swine flu panic has been downgraded to a distant irritant, the climate crisis endures.</p>
<p>Other worries have crowded in, mostly economic, pushing the environment down the list of voter concerns. Meanwhile, climate-change deniers (if only they were right) continue their relentless campaign to protect polluting industries, emboldened by leaked e-mails purporting to show leading climate scientists making things sound worse than they are.</p>
<p>All this has been an immense relief to the Harper government, which, always alert to public mood, has stopped even pretending to believe in the need for urgent action. The real crisis, according to Environment Minister Jim Prentice, would be moving too fast.</p>
<p>"It would be ill-advised to rush though major shifts in the economy and Canadian lifestyles in the next five to 10 years," Prentice said recently, as if that was likely. Better to be prudent and wait until 2050 when we are up to our hubcaps in salt water.</p>
<p>Prentice insists Canada will not implement regulations, or, evidently, do anything concrete, until the U.S. and the rest of the world acts. He has a point: We have to harmonize our emissions trading system with the U.S., given our entwined economies.</p>
<p>Hence, the prime minister's decision to go to Copenhagen came on the heels of news that U.S. President Barack Obama will drop by the conference -- we're already moving in lock-step. But history suggests Canada will try to act as a brake on Obama's climate ambitions, not a prod.</p>
<p>That aside, Obama will commit his country to reducing emissions by 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020.</p>
<p>This is close to Canada's announced target of a 20 per cent reduction below 2006 levels by 2020 -- but with an important caveat.</p>
<p>Obama's plan, which has still to pass the Senate, would impose absolute caps on emissions, not the weaker intensity caps promised by the federal government. And the U.S. administration has promised billions to advance green technologies and energy efficiency measures. By contrast, Harper is putting his faith, and much of his money, into carbon capture and storage -- an expensive, uncertain technology that stores emissions underground, but is also used to extract more oil from depleted wells.</p>
<p>As for Ignatieff, in Quebec he unveiled his most detailed plan yet for addressing climate change, although he avoided explicit targets.</p>
<p>He promised to quadruple investment in renewables, encourage energy efficiency, toughen building codes and support sustainable transportation such as high-speed rail. It is a familiar list of remedies (not unlike Obama's), which, coupled with promised hard caps, would work. Ignatieff's problem won't be his plan, but his credibility.</p>
<p>He has already evolved from a champion of a carbon tax to an oilsands booster. He rarely mentions the environment in question period. This sudden policy download looks more like a new strategy, from his new team, than a heartfelt commitment.</p>
<p>For environmentalists, only Quebec is a bright spot. It promises to cut emissions by 20 per cent over 1990 levels by 2020, the most ambitious targets on the continent.</p>
<p>Quebec is a major exporter of clean hydro power, so the costs of going green aren't as dire as they would be for Alberta. But an enlightened federal government, with a coherent energy strategy, would encourage export of electricity over oil -- and ensure that benefits, and penalties, are shared. Instead, Harper appears intent on extracting every last drop from the oilsands before turning his attention to climate change.</p>
<p>"If we in Canada, and in Quebec, want others to act, we need to accept that we have to act also," Premier Jean Charest said.</p>
<p>That, for those unfamiliar with the concept, is leadership.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sask. has vaccine for 75% of residents</b>

<p>Saskatchewan now has enough H1N1 vaccine on hand to jab the arms of three-quarters of the province's residents.</p>
<p>In the latest shipment on Monday, Saskatchewan received 200,000 doses of vaccine, bringing the total number of doses received in the province to 637,000, said Saskatchewan's deputy chief medical health officer, Dr. Saqib Shahab, at a media briefing Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>During the briefing, Shahab confirmed a death under investigation last week is now being attributed to the H1N1 virus. The latest to succumb was a middle-aged man.</p>
<p>That brings the number of H1N1-related deaths in the province to 12 -- an equal number of men and women.</p>
<p>"Most individuals had significant underlying health conditions," Shahab said.</p>
<p>Close to half of Saskatchewan residents have received the pandemic immunization. Of those who haven't been vaccinated, most are healthy adults ranging in age from 18 to 64 years, but a significant number of people with underlying health conditions have not yet been immunized.</p>
<p>Shahab said Saskatchewan residents have shown a higher-than-expected interest in getting vaccinated, but data isn't available to compare the province with other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Although the second wave has peaked, he warned the pandemic virus is still circulating and low levels will be around until the spring.</p>
<p>"The higher the percentage of population overall that's vaccinated, the lower the overall ongoing disease activity will be," Shahab said.</p>
<p>He urged everyone who hasn't yet received their shot to get vaccinated at mass immunization clinics, which will continue in most health regions until mid-December.</p>
<p>"If you get vaccinated now, you'll be fully protected for meeting and greeting friends and family over the holiday season," Shahab said.</p>
<p>Residents should check their health region's website to find out when and where the clinics will be held. Later this month, the vaccine will still be available by appointment at local public health offices.</p>
<p>Deborah Jordan, executive director of acute and emergency services with the Ministry of Health, said most health regions are still reporting some influenza-like illness (ILI) activity, but fewer people with flu symptoms are going to emergency rooms and fewer antivirals are being dispensed.</p>
<p>Depending on the health region, recent ILI visits to emergency rooms range from zero to 6.4 per cent. That compares to a couple of weeks ago, when patients with ILI symptoms accounted for between 4.5 and 23 per cent of ER visits.</p>
<p>However, critical care units in the Saskatoon Health Region continue to be under pressure because of H1N1 and ventilators have been requested from other health regions.</p>
<p>Typically, St. Paul's Hospital and the Royal University Hospital each have 12 critical care beds in operation. At a peak period on Tuesday, each site had 14 to 15 intensive care patients.</p>
<p>"Saskatoon has had to create temporarily some additional capacity and thus the request for additional ventilators to come in from other regions," Jordan said.</p>
<p>"The patients are being cared for, but it's important that the system work together."</p>
<p>HealthLine is receiving a dramatic decrease in ILI-related calls -- from 700 calls a day to about 200 daily.</p>

<p>Question: My wife and I both got vaccinated for H1N1 and would like to know if there would be any side effects to the development of a fetus? Should we wait for some time before conception of a baby?</p>
<p>Answer: There are no recommendations to delay conception of a baby after being given influenza vaccine (seasonal or H1N1).</p>
<p>Women are instructed to avoid pregnancy for one month following administration of certain live vaccines (for example, measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox).</p>
<p>This is because of the theoretical risk of virus transmission to the fetus. However, as the influenza vaccine is a killed (inactivated) vaccine no such delays are necessary.</p>
<p>Question about H1N1 can be sent to pcowan@leaderpost.canwest.com. We will answer those of the most general interest.</p>

<p>Canada's top doctor pleaded with Canadians on Wednesday to get vaccinated against H1N1, warning millions more Canadians could still be infected with the virus.</p>
<p>Despite evidence an epidemic peak has been reached by all provinces and territories, Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said the number of people with flu-like illnesses seeking medical treatment is three times higher than what is normally seen at this time of year.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said the latest data confirms H1N1 is hitting younger people especially hard.</p>
<p>The highest proportion of H1N1 infections is occurring in people under 15; 40 per cent of deaths are occurring in people age 40 to 65.</p>
<p>As well, 40 per cent of those admitted to intensive care, and one-third of those who have died of pandemic H1N1, have not had any pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
<p>Sixteen per cent of those hospitalized with H1N1 have been admitted to an ICU, and up to 80 per cent of H1N1 ICU patients have required breathing assistance or ventilation.</p>
<p>Those most seriously affected by H1N1 are 23 to 45 years younger than what is normally seen with seasonal flu. During last winter's flu season, the median age for hospitalization from flu and pneumonia was 71. For ICU admission, it was 68 and for death, 82.</p>

</div><div>Barbara Yaffe   </div>
<div>The Windsor Star</div>

</p>
<p>As health care costs continue to reach amazing new heights, Canadian politicians are trying hard to look the other way.</p>
<p>Debate during Parliament's fall session has focused on the roll-out of stimulus spending, H1N1, crime, the long gun registry; all manner of things -- except health costs. This, despite the fact:</p>
<p>- Governments spent $172 billion in 2008 on health care, nearly 60 per cent more than a decade ago. Only half that increase is attributable to combined effects of population growth, inflation and aging.</p>
<p>- Drug spending increased by 136 per cent during the decade.</p>
<p>- In B.C. this year, health care will account for 47.5 per cent of government expenditures; and 43 per cent in Ontario.</p>
<p>With governments increasingly confronting jumbo deficits, it's hard to see how the issue can be "back-burnered" much longer.</p>
<p>As the Canadian Institute for Health Information observed in its latest annual report: "If there is a unifying theme to the past decade in Canadian health care it is abundance.</p>
<p>"Spending rose substantially compared to the previous decade's restraint."</p>
<p>Even with the spending, the institute concludes: "we do not have enough comprehensive information to link, with any precision, health care spending to health outcomes."</p>
<p>In the November issue of the Literary Review of Canada, physician and health consultant Charles J. Wright argues Canadians are overdosing on medicare, consuming more health services and pharmaceuticals than is in fact good for them. He says medicare has gone way beyond its original mandate, which was to provide "necessary medical services," provided by physicians and hospitals.</p>
<p>And in years to come spending could well increase because governments have lately invested in training more health care professionals. In the last 10 years, for example, the entering class of medical students has increased by 68 per cent; nursing students by 51 per cent.</p>
<p>Wright warns that Canada's "continuous limitless growth of health services cannot possibly be sustained.</p>
<p>"All but the most mathematically challenged supporters of universal health care recognize that there is a limit and that we have reached it."</p>
<p>The public has been hearing this sort of message for years and the spending has continued. Health care costs have gone from consuming seven per cent of GDP in 1975 to 9.8 per cent in 2005 and this year spending is expected to reach 10.7 per cent of GDP.</p>
<p>Studies launched under prime minister Jean Chretien included the 2001 Romanow Commission, the 1999 Kirby Commission and the 1994 National Forum on Health.</p>
<p>All failed to provide the impetus to curb costs. "The serious need for change," asserts Wright, "seems to face an even more serious lack of political enthusiasm."</p>
<p>Politicians, knowing voters are sensitive about access to health services, haven't wanted to touch the file with a bargepole. Wright argues bigger health budgets aren't necessarily translating into better outcomes; that in some cases, therapeutic testing and prescription drugs are doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>The Canadian Institute for Health Information notes that governments will be better able to judge the efficacy of all the spending once health records are computerized. Ottawa's last budget earmarked $500 million for work on electronic health records. Ballooning health budgets, of course, aren't an exclusively Canadian problem.</p>
<p>When it comes to spending as a percentage of GDP Canada ranks seventh among 30 industrialized nations, with the U.S. at the top, with 17.6 per cent of GDP going toward health care in 2009. If misery loves company, there's plenty of it to go around.</p>

</div><div>Michael Fumento   </div>

<p>The folks who dubbed the swine flu piglet a pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO), just won't let up.</p>
<p>"It is too early to say whether there has yet been a peak in infections in the northern hemisphere," Reuters paraphrased the WHO as saying, "and it will be some weeks before there is a downward trend in the numbers of those catching the virus."</p>
<p>Wrong across the board for both Canada and the U.S.</p>
<p>In the U.S., flu deaths and hospitalizations have declined for the third straight week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Regarding Canada specifically, the WHO claims "influenza activity remains similar but [the] number of hospitalizations and deaths is increasing." But Health Canada's Flu-Watch website, updated weekly, begs to differ.</p>
<p>"All influenza indicators declined," according to FluWatch, speaking of Nov. 27. Just what part of "all" doesn't the WHO understand?</p>
<p>Specifically, the website states, "The number of deaths decreased slightly this week as well as the number of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and number of hospitalizations."</p>
<p>Logically, if U.S. and Canadian deaths, ICU admissions and hospitalizations are all down, and if you need to get infected with the flu before you can be sickened or die from it, then it's hardly "too early" to say whether there's "been a peak of infections," is it?</p>
<p>As it happens though, both the U.S. and Canada have plenty of direct measurements of swine flu infection for the WHO to ignore. In the U.S., the number of swine flu infections that laboratories have detected has been dropping for four straight weeks and is 83% off its peak; in Canada, positive specimens are half what they were two weeks ago.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the number of states with "geographically widespread influenza activity" has gone from 48 to just 32, while in Canada, the number of regions "reporting widespread or localized influenza activity" has declined for two weeks in a row, says FluWatch. The vast majority of the country now has only "sporadic activity," including half of Ontario and almost all of Quebec. Further the "overall number of influenza outbreaks" in Canadian schools and hospitals has fallen by over half in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Yet somehow, despite all of this, the WHO doesn't perceive a "downward trend." Is it disregarding data in favour of feeling chicken entrails?</p>
<p>While we're at it, whatever became of the WHO's "pandemic" anyway? Until swine flu trotted in, pandemics were far deadlier than the yearly outbreaks of seasonal flu. Since seasonal flu ordinarily strikes all parts of the world, what other distinguishing feature should a flu pandemic have other than severity?</p>
<p>Yet swine flu, according to CDC estimates, is killing Americans at a rate that is one-third to one-12th that of seasonal flu. And that estimate is almost certainly too high. French figures, for example, are far lower as are those collected by New York City.</p>
<p>Every year in this country, 2,000 to 8,000 people die of flu, according to Health Canada. Swine flu, conversely, in the almost eight months since the outbreak began, has killed merely 138. Worldwide, WHO figures show fewer swine flu deaths in eight months than seasonal flu deaths every two weeks.</p>
<p>The WHO has been dishonest about swine flu from the very beginning. It's used its phony pandemic to cover up its five-year scarefest over an avian flu pandemic that never came, to feed at the trough of greater power and a fatter budget, and even to call for redistribution of international wealth on the basis of values "like community, solidarity, equity and social justice," in the words of its director.</p>
<p>There's no motivation for the WHO to suddenly use that ubiquitous hand disinfectant and come clean.</p>

<p>Leap Frog My Pal Scout, 6-36 months, SRP $24.99: This interactive puppy with songs was monopolized by the three-year-odds at Linda Larkin's day home, so the younger toddlers have hardly had a chance to play with it, she says. The toy is sturdy and has a comforting, soothing voice and it's easy to download the content.</p>
<p>"It's a nice little learning tool for kids," she says.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Brik-a-Blok , ages 6+, SRP $110 for 26 panels, $180 for 46 panels: While this is the most expensive toy we've reviewed here, the Ewanishin family maintains this newly developed, Canadian toy is worth every penny.</p>
<p>The large panels snap together easily to create kid-sized houses, tunnels or castles, say dad, Mark, father of twin six-year-odds and twin three-year-odds.</p>
<p>The older two designed a house to sleep in overnight, and when the younger ones stepped on the panels, they snapped easily into shape again.</p>
<p>"It appeals to them because they can build big things with it. And it took very little involvement from us. The older ones figured it out. They're really impressed with it.... I'm impressed with it."</p>
<p>If you're considering a family present, this may be it. Ewanishin recommends getting 46 panels for the creativity.</p>
<p>A drawback is that it's only available by phone (1-877-646-2221) or online(www. brikablok.com),so order now.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Little Tykes Apple Grove Pals Friends Pack, 12 months +, SRP from $9.99 to $34.99:The two under-2-year-olds at Linda Larkin's day home adore the characters so much that she's stocking up on another set. "The characters are very cute and they're a nice size for their hands, and they like taking their hats on and off," she says. The accompanying board book isn't quite as durable, but that may be because she has six kids in the house.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Mega Bloks Play 'n Go Table, 12 months +, SRP$60: Amelie Barry, 22 months, was attracted to the little table with elementary building blocks, a built-in car track and a little car for the first few days, reports her mum, Ivana, but eventually just enjoyed sending the car along the floor, rather than around the little track. If the child likes building things, she adds, you'd probably need more blocks to make it interesting.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Jakks Pacific Sing Scene Pop, ages 8+, SRP $30: This is plug-and-play karaoke with a twist -- if you don't reach the notes properly, you're kicked off the stage. The songs by Rihanna, Fergie, Alicia Keys and Miley Cyrus are aimed at the bubble gum crowd -- just the thing for a tween get-together.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Jakks Pacific Gourmet Girl Sweets, Candy Bead Studio, ages 8+, SRP $20: Because of the different types of edible products, including sticky icing, Dawn Ius suggests using this with a group of kids so you don't have to deal with leftovers. Her stepdaughter, Aydra Dalton, 13, and a friend had fun with the licorice necklaces and the lockable felts-- "Aydra had more fun drawing on her tongue and her body", said IUs. But wearing something with sticky icing wasn't too appealing.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Fisher-Price</span> Baby Baby Ah-Choo, ages 2+, SRP$43:With all the hype about H1N1 and other infectious diseases, having a doll that sneezes, needs to take medicine and have her nose wiped may be a good learning toy, but this isn't the best one, says Tammie Cretney. While the doll talks and even "toots", much to the amusement of Julia, 2, it also says "yucky" when you hold the medicine spoon to her mouth. "That's not teaching my daughter how to take medicine," she says.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Matchbox Rocky the Robot Truck, ages 3+, SRP$87:Two-year-old Eric loves trucks, so when he saw a chatty dump truck that giggles, tells jokes and dances, it was love at first sight. "He went for a sleepover to Gramma and Grampa and he had to bring it," says his mum, Sunita Roed. Now he goes around saying "piece of cake", and looking for different things to pile into the back. For kids who adore trucks, this is perfect.</p>
<p>Barbie Glamour Camper, ages 3+, SRP $100: Justine, 8 and Samantha, 6, have an older version of the Barbie camper, but this one has a pop-out tent and campfire area and lots of neat little features. "They gave it a five out of five," reports their mum, Christine Kearney.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Mega Bloks Yo Gabba Gabba DJ Lance Boombox, ages 3+, SRP$50: The six toddlers and preschoolers at Linda Larkin's day home "absolutely love it," she says of the radio that comes with little figurines the kids incorporate in other toys. The kids enjoy it because it's like their own stereo system, and adults like it because it has two volumes, and enough musical variety that it doesn't become annoying to listen to.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Road Champs Motorized Multi-Launcher GX Racers, ages 5+, SRP $40: Joe Tsang, 8, was still playing with the multi-functional launcher more than a week after he'd received it, reports his mother, Christina. And even though it's meant to launch the five cars that come with it, the launcher's machine-gun sounds make it a great dual-purpose toy for chasing his older brother.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Six weeks into the H1N1 vaccination effort, provinces and territories have vaccinated nearly a third of Canadians, figures compiled and calculated by The Canadian Press reveal.</p>
<p>With mass vaccination clinics still underway in many parts of the country, the estimate is a moving target, out of date as quickly as it is tallied.</p>
<p>But the rough national average is about 32 per cent - not yet as high as authorities would like. That said, when compared to most other countries, the numbers aren't exactly shabby either.</p>
<p>Sweden, with a population of 9.3 million people, has vaccinated more than 35 per cent of its population. But the U.S., with a population of 308 million, has shipped only 70 million doses - enough for 23 per cent of Americans - to states so far. It's unclear how many of those doses have been administered.</p>
<p>"Frankly, it's progressing rather well," Dr. Danielle Grondin, assistant deputy minister for the Public Health Agency of Canada, says of Canada's effort.</p>
<p>"Overall, public health officials, including us, we are happy with the way that it's going . . . There is a demand. There is an uptake. It's there and it's increasing."</p>
<p>Manufacturing problems experienced by nearly all the producers have meant that vaccine roll out has been slower than anticipated in all countries with vaccine contracts.</p>
<p>And most countries don't have vaccine contracts. The World Health Organization estimated late last week that about 40 countries had started to vaccinate against the pandemic virus.</p>
<p>In Canada, some jurisdictions have hit high vaccination rates. The three northern territories report they have all immunized over half of their populations.</p>
<p>Dr. Brendan Hanley, chief medical officer of health for Yukon says that's in part because the territories received their entire allotments of vaccine when it first became available - and when demand was high. With their small populations and full complements of vaccine, they could offer it to anyone who wanted it right from the start.</p>
<p>"We didn't have to go through the sequencing agonies, I guess, that the provinces had to go through."</p>

</p>
<p>The Boston Bruins have locked up centre Marc Savard to a seven-year contract extension through the 2016-17 season.</p>
<p>According to a number of sources, the average salary cap hit will be around $4.2 million US per year.</p>
<p>The Ottawa native has played 12 seasons in the NHL with the New York Rangers, Calgary Flames, Atlanta Thrashers and Bruins.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old, who recently returned to action after suffering a broken foot, has scored four goals and six assists in 11 games this season. He scored 25 goals and 63 assists last season to lead the team in scoring.</p>
<p>One of the league's top playmaking centres, Savard is in the final year of a contract that pays him $5 million this season. He is in his fourth season with the Bruins.</p>
<p>He was originally drafted by the Rangers in the fourth round (91st overall) in the 1995 entry draft.</p>
<p>Corvo Surgery</p>
<p>Carolina Hurricanes defenceman Joe Corvo is expected to be sidelined for at least eight weeks after his right leg was cut by a skate and required surgery.</p>
<p>The team said Tuesday that Corvo was placed on injured reserve after he injured his leg the night before in a 3-2 loss to Washington.</p>
<p>Corvo's lower right leg was cut by Washington defenceman Karl Alzner's skate during a first-period collision, and he had surgery on Monday night. The Hurricanes say Corvo may miss as much as 12 weeks.</p>
<p>Klesla Out A Month</p>
<p>The Columbus Blue Jackets have placed Rostislav Klesla on injured reserve after the defenceman sustained a lower-body injury in a game against St. Louis.</p>
<p>Blue Jackets general manager Scott Howson announced the move on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Klesla was injured in a mid-ice collision with the Blues' Barret Jackman during the first period of the Blue Jackets' 5-2 victory Monday night. He is believed to have torn a groin muscle and is expected to be sidelined for at least a month.</p>
<p>Miettinen Back</p>
<p>Minnesota Wild right wing Antti Miettinen has returned after missing the last three games with what was diagnosed as swine flu. Coach Todd Richards said Tuesday he believes Miettinen will play Wednesday against Nashville.</p>
<p>Right wing Martin Havlat has missed the last four games because of a hamstring injury and defenceman Marek Zidlicky was out of the last game due to an upper-body injury. But both players are expected to play against the Predators.</p>
<p>It's Official</p>
<p>The Montreal Canadiens, who have won a record 24 Stanley Cups, were officially sold to the Molson family on Tuesday when National Hockey League owners approved the deal.</p>
<p>In a unanimous vote, the league board of governors rubber-stamped an agreement reached last June between American George Gillett and brothers Geoff, Andrew and Justin Molson -- whose beer is among Canada's most popular.</p>
<p>Ice Chips</p>
<p>Philadelphia Flyers winger Simon Gagne( groin) has resumed skating for the first time in nearly a month . . . New Jersey Devils winger Jay Pandolfo has resumed skating for the first time since suffering a shoulder injury on Oct. 24 . . . The National Hockey League will expand into new markets before it relocates franchises from current cities, commissioner Gary Bettman said on Tuesday . . . Bettman also said the NHL will not decide for several years if it will allow its players to participate in the 2014 Sochi Olympics.</p>

</p>
<p>Montreal public-health authorities are again appealing to pregnant women, especially those from cultural communities, to get vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus as the second wave of the pandemic appears to be on the decline.</p>
<p>Only half of all pregnant women in the city have been inoculated to date, compared with 55.7 per cent provincially.</p>
<p>Although authorities have reported a notable increase in the number of people with chronic illnesses getting flu shots, very few pregnant women have chosen to get vaccinated since last week.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Lessard, director of the Montreal Public Health Department, warned that pregnant women are particularly at risk of developing serious complications, like pneumonia, from the swine flu.</p>
<p>"We are on the downside of the second wave - there's no doubt about it - but the virus is still circulating," Lessard said. "And that's why we want pregnant women to get vaccinated because they are at a higher risk."</p>
<p>A total of 30 pregnant women in Quebec have been hospitalized as a result of H1N1 complications, and two have died. Both were in the 38th week of their pregnancy.</p>
<p>Diane Francoeur, chief of obstetrics-gynecology at Ste. Justine Hospital, said some newborns have developed laboratory-confirmed H1N1 flu because their mothers were infected.</p>
<p>"The only way for babies up to six months to get protected - because they can't get vaccinated - is for pregnant women to get the shot," Francoeur said. "They will pass on antibodies against the virus to their babies."</p>
<p>Francoeur warned that with the approaching Christmas holidays and parties, pregnant women are especially susceptible to catching all kinds of viruses.</p>
<p>Lessard said that the vaccine is available now in both the non-adjuvant and adjuvant form to pregnant women and there are no longer long lineups.</p>
<p>Authorities have bemoaned the low turnout at vaccination centres in Park Extension and other districts with a large proportion of minorities. For health professionals, communicating the importance of vaccination to pregnant women who know neither English nor French is a problem, Lessard conceded.</p>

</p>
<p>On the eve of Prime Minister Stephen Harper's visit to Beijing, China has agreed to lift a ban on Canadian pork products, worth an estimated $50 million per year, Parliament heard Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pierre Lemieux, the parliamentary secretary to the minister of agriculture, told the House of Commons that "effective immediately, China has agreed to lift the ban on all imports of pork products into China from Canada."</p>
<p>China, Canada's second-largest trade partner, banned pork imports from Canada, the United States and Mexico last May in the wake of the first outbreak of swine flu.</p>
<p>Harper, who had stoked the ire of Chinese leaders in 2007 by meeting with the Dalai Lama, is hoping to move to more moderate ground with the Asian nation during his trip.</p>
<p>The policy change also means U.S. and Mexican pork producers will again have access to the growing Chinese market.</p>

</div><div>Scott Cruickshank   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>811 words</div><div>2 December 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>C4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>A fter Monday's gem in Nashville, Brent Sutter showed no interest in gloating.</p>
<p>Sure, the clinical 5-0 decision over the Predators meant that his team had equalled the franchise record for points in consecutive road games, 10.</p>
<p>Sure, it had capped a wonderful month for the Calgary Flames, who finished their November docket with a 10-2-2 log and rocketed into first place in the Northwest Division.</p>
<p>But revel in hitting the 10-win plateau for only the 11th time in club history?</p>
<p>Not likely.</p>
<p>"I guess I really don't look at months," the Flames pilot said. "The games come so fast and everything happens so quickly that you just start getting ready for your next game. This was a big win and we've got a couple days until our next game (Thursday against the home-ice Phoenix Coyotes)."</p>
<p>Remember, weeks ago, contemplating November's workload?</p>
<p>And thinking that the local gents would be hard-pressed to survive that month's steep challenges?</p>
<p>Waste of worry, apparently.</p>
<p>Because the Calgarians are 3-0-0 at the midway point of their winter's most arduous journey.</p>
<p>"A good way to start the trip," said Sutter. "Again, I don't like getting caught up in months. Every game is a big game, every game is like a playoff-type game. I know it's only the end of November, but you can see the races, you can see the standings. Every point you can get is big.</p>
<p>"Your schedule is your schedule. You don't worry about it too much, you just make sure you manage the days between your games appropriately."</p>
<p>The Flames had slunk into November after that ghoulish 3-1 loss to the Detroit Red Wings on Halloween night. That result had set Sutter to seething.</p>
<p>He wondered aloud at the "casual" nature of the Flames. That might not sound like much of a dig, but it's pretty damning for longtime leaders in that locker-room.</p>
<p>November started with the H1N1 flu-shot fallout, with the team on the road in a hellish building (<span class="companylink">American Airlines</span> Center), with the star netminder sick.</p>
<p>Good grief.</p>
<p>But that month-opening night, Nov. 4 at Dallas, the Flames got winning goaltending from Curtis McElhinney and a remarkable performance from Jarome Iginla--three points: scores game's opening goal, sets up last-minute equalizer, drains overtime winner.</p>
<p>From there, the Flames could hardly have drawn up a better month.</p>
<p>Yes, you'd be right to assume that the Nov. 19 pratfall against the Chicago Blackhawks, 7-1, has been duly scrubbed from their memory banks. Maybe the ability to do that--shrug off a mess and just get on with it--is a positive sign, too.</p>
<p>In recent winters, Mike Keenan had been preoccupied with a just-win-baby mindset, but Sutter is journey obsessed. Ends and means--they both matter.</p>
<p>Which leads the man to say things like this in a victory's aftermath: "Our overall game, our process to have the outcome turn out the way it did, was very good."</p>
<p>From Sutter, there is recurring chatter of "puck management" and "support from underneath" and "neutral-zone play" and "staying with it."</p>
<p>Dude might be on to something. Here are some fun facts from the 14 games of November:</p>
<p>- The Flames went 2-2-0 at home, 8-0-2 away.( "There's a reason they're really good on the road," said Nashville skipper Barry Trotz. "We saw why.")</p>
<p>- They scored 38 goals, allowed 25.</p>
<p>- Their power play was 9-for-52 (17.3 per cent), their penalty killing 43-for-54 (79.6 per cent).</p>
<p>- Iginla scored 13 times, added seven helpers, for a 20-point month. Olli Jokinen picked up 14 points, while Nigel Dawes got 10.</p>
<p>- Iginla potted three game-winners. Jamie Lundmark had one, plus a decisive shootout conversion. Five others contributed winners.</p>
<p>- Daymond Langkow, at one time the league's very worst in this department, was a team-best plus-nine. Jay Bouwmeester and Dawes were each plus-eight.</p>
<p>- Dion Phaneuf dished out 35 hits, Mark Giordano 24. Bouwmeester blocked 21 shots, Robyn Regehr 19.</p>
<p>- Dawes enters December on a four-game goal streak. David Moss has points in four straight games.</p>
<p>- McElhinney made two starts, winning them both. Kiprusoff, who went 8-2-2, rides into December with back-to-back bagels and a significant 129:30 shutout string.</p>
<p>- In March 1991, the Flames prevailed 11 times--their winningest month ever. Four times now, they've had 10 victories in November.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Colvin is just doing his job; Embattled diplomat is merely carrying out his duty to the Crown</b>
</div><div>Amir Attaran and Gar Pardy   </div>
<div>Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1475 words</div><div>2 December 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Poor Richard Colvin. Swiftboated by Defence Minister Peter MacKay as "not credible" and a mouthpiece of the Taliban, now the attorney general of Canada is on his back, threatening prosecution if he dares to answer a parliamentary committee's request to see documents he wrote about detainee abuse and torture in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The character assassination and bullying are nonsense, of course-- the same government that slandered Colvin also promoted him to an intelligence job with top-secret clearance in Canada's Washington embassy-- but if one can set aside the revulsion, what does the Colvin affair teach about the duties of public servants to tell the truth?As a law professor and retired diplomat(who once held Colvin's job in Washington), there are four lessons we think every civil servant in Ottawa should know.</p>
<p>One lesson is that the conventional wisdom--that Colvin is a whistle-blower, who is now being punished --is an attractive Hollywood story, but a distant relative of the truth. Colvin was sent to Afghanistan with a job to do, which was to gather observations on political issues related to Canada's mission. His notes are the focus of everyone's interest not because he did his job poorly, but because he did it well. He also did well when, sensing imminent government interference because he was summoned as a witness before the Military Police Complaints Commission, he invoked a Treasury Board policy that entitles civil servants to an independent lawyer on request.</p>
<p>Nor did he transgress his job by accepting Parliament's invitation to testify last week, even if it infuriated the Harper government and sycophantic civil servants above him. Like all civil servants, Colvin owes a duty of loyalty to the Government of Canada--including Parliament.</p>
<p>That explains why, for all their loathing of Colvin, MacKay and other cabinet ministers mutter he won't be fired--because he can't be. Since they can't fire, they bully; it's all they have.</p>
<p>The second lesson is that many, perhaps most, civil servants do not truly understand the duty of loyalty upon them. Ignorance suits the Harper government; it relishes control, and the uninformed err safely on the side of excess loyalty. Too much loyalty, however, means too little innovation or constructive criticism at best, or exploitation and job dissatisfaction at worst. It is better, for Canada and for civil servants themselves, to know truly where the limits of loyalty lie.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada wrote the final word on the duty of loyalty in 1985:</p>
<p>"The loyalty owed is to the Government of Canada, not the political party in power at any one time. A public servant need not vote for the governing party. Nor need he or she publicly espouse its policies. And indeed, in some circumstances a public servant may actively and publicly express opposition to the policies of a government. This would be appropriate if, for example, the Government were engaged in illegal acts, or if its policies jeopardized the life, health or safety of the public servant or others, or if the public servant's criticism had no impact on his or her ability to perform effectively the duties of a public servant or on the public perception of that ability."</p>
<p>Note what the Supreme Court's analysis does not require. Civil servants owe loyalty to the government of Canada--the Crown, if you will --but not the governing party. In public, no civil servant need agree with party policy. Civil servants can dissent from Government of Canada policy in public, within limits, such as when the government is "engaged in illegal acts, or if its policies jeopardized the life, health or safety of ... others."</p>
<p>Seen that way--the legally correct way, because the Supreme Court says so--Colvin did not violate his duty of loyalty to the government of Canada. Complicity in torture is highly illegal--a war crime. Government policies or mistakes that lead to torture are ruinous to life, health or safety. Colvin was not just legally correct, but supremely ethical, to disclose about torture and the detainee transfer policy, no matter what political aftershocks. That he did so with dignity in Parliament, after notifying his superiors, gives him additional protections under the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act.</p>
<p>The third lesson is that dissent has to be done carefully. Going directly to the media with a counterpunch or leaked document is not as safe as it should be. That is not because journalists are dishonourable--only the rarest scoundrels don't protect sources--but because the lower courts seem resistant to the Supreme Court's direction when disclosures are journalistic. The lower courts are probably wrong, but their error is reality.</p>
<p>The best way for would-be disclosers is to see a lawyer. This is because confidential information and instructions given to a lawyer are protected by the iron rule of solicitor-client privilege. The information normally cannot be forcibly discovered and is inadmissible in court. Whether the information is unprotected or top secret is immaterial, and the privilege exists to foster free, frank discussion with the lawyer.</p>
<p>Thus Colvin disclosed to his lawyer, and his lawyer cleverly arranged disclosing to the world. The lawyer proved her worth by picking a path through hazards both real and imagined-- for a favourite government tactic is to intimidate civil servants into secrecy without actually having a legal basis. Section 38 of the Canada Evidence Act, which the attorney general overuses to gag persons who possess national security or international relations information, is one such questionable threat, because the law does not provide any criminal penalty for ignoring section 38 secrecy per se. The government also exaggerates the Security of Information Act:much of that law was struck down as unconstitutional by the courts three years ago.</p>
<p>In short, the tigers the government uses to enforce secrecy often are toothless, or can be safely defanged by a lawyer, particularly if he or she is an expert in public law.</p>
<p>Technology also makes safe disclosure possible without a lawyer. Wikileaks ( wikileaks.org)is an ultra-secure, totally anonymous website that accepts documents from around the world. No source has ever been exposed through Wikileaks, though it has been used more than a million times. Think of it as the web's brown envelope, which not even China's notorious Internet spies have cracked.</p>
<p>The final lesson is, of course, one of ethics. When MacKay taunted and laughed at reporters questioning how retired general Rick Hillier saw secret documents ahead of testifying in Parliament--the very same secret documents that the government has threatened Colvin not to let Parliament see--he demonstrated reprehensible ethics (search for it at cbc.ca/video).</p>
<p>Making ethical disclosure means never personally sinking to his level; it means lifting the full weight of Canada's democracy above it. The Canadians who lost their lives in Afghanistan, and the many more maimed, sacrificed in defence of ideals--including transparency and parliamentary democracy. Civil servants let them down when assisting a government that, confronted with its responsibilities under Canadian and international law such as to avoid torture, ducks, bobs, weaves and shoots messengers in its tortuous path.</p>
<p>They even let down their fellow civil servants, such as Colvin. Of the many bureaucrats he copied on his reports, not one has disclosed those documents, so Canadians might independently decide whether Colvin or the government is the more truthful. They have left him undefended --even when, as just explained, disclosure can be lawful, safe and ethical. It is a course, frankly, chosen of fear and ignorance.</p>
<p>We recommend this course: civil servants and diplomats are privileged to be some of the best educated Canadians, and have an ethical responsibility to help other Canadians understand government's complexity. Techniques exist to disclose safely, without becoming an unemployed martyr. Our government's involvement in Afghanistan is tremendously complex, and the civic interest depends on Canadians understanding it, even--perhaps especially--when the truth is hard, such as torture. The same is true for other complex subjects ringed in secrecy when the Supreme Court's criteria come into play: the H1N1 flu, for example.</p>
<p>If civil servants comport themselves with such honour in Canada, as is more often done in America (think Daniel Ellsberg) or Britain (think Katharine Gun), Canada will be a stronger country. Never doubt it.</p>

</p>
<p>"Global warming" is the word of the decade, according to the Global Language Monitor, as the term weighed heavily over both international political discourse and helped popularize the green movement.</p>
<p>The list of the Top 25 words contains a number that reflect the decade's challenges and tragedies -- 9/11, bailout, and evacuee/ refugee are all in the top five--and the increasingly connected lives we lead (<span class="companylink">Google</span>, blog, Twitter, texting, dot-com, Y2K).</p>
<p>That technology is so well represented on the list shouldn't come as a surprise to followers of the evolution of English.</p>
<p>In June, the Austin, Texas-based company deemed the one millionth word in the language to be "Web 2.0."</p>
<p>Other notables on the list, such as Chinglish (the growing English-Chinese hybrid language), Slumdog (referring to slum-dwellers in Mumbai, popularized by the film Slumdog Millionaire) and tsunami, point to a world increasingly aware of developing nations such as China and India.</p>
<p>"Obama" was third on the list, but, inevitably, former U.S. president George W. Bush left a bigger mark. One of his more famous malapropisms, misunderestimate, came in at No. 15, while WMD (weapons of mass destruction) took No. 18, and quagmire--what many had feared Iraq would become, and what Afghanistan increasingly appears to be--was No. 24.</p>
<p>"Looking at the first decade of the 21st century in words is a sober, even sombre, event," Paul J.J. Payack, the company's president, said in a release.</p>
<p>"For a decade that began with such joy and hope, the words chosen depict a far more complicated and in many ways, tragic time."</p>
<p>The 18th-century English writer Samuel Johnson wrote that it's laughable for a lexicographer to "imagine that his dictionary can embalm his language and secure it from corruption and decay."</p>
<p>Paul Keen, director of Carleton University's English department, agreed, saying the list "really proves just how alive language really is."</p>
<p>A term such as global warming, said Keen, represents the distillation of a complex concept into an easily remembered and evocative phrase. "What needs to happen for things to become . . . an initiative that people can mobilize around is to develop a way of speaking about it.</p>
<p>"It makes the science intelligible."</p>
<p>Or take bailout, another catch-all word meaning government assistance that has given unemployed autoworkers, opposition politicians and disgruntled investors a word to rally around.</p>
<p>"What we do to deal with the unfamiliar and with change is by using some of the most comfortable language we have," said Keen.</p>
<p>"Politically, that can become important because it make things that seem threatening intelligible.</p>
<p>"It can be bad because metaphors can distort things to make them seem simpler than they are, but it can also make them more accessible to people."</p>
<p>And just in case you weren't sick of it yet, H1N1 came in at 11.</p>
<p>The Global Language Monitor's tops of the decade:</p>
<p>Top Words</p>
<p>1. Global Warming (2000) -- rated highly from Day 1 of the decade.</p>
<p>2. 9/11 (2001)--another inauspicious start to the decade.</p>
<p>3. Obama (2008)--U. S. president's name as a 'root' word or 'word stem.'</p>
<p>4. Bailout (2008)--the bank bailout was but Act 1 of the crisis.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Google</span> (2007)</p>
<p>Founders misspelled actual word 'googol'</p>
<p>5. Evacuee/refugee (2005)--after hurricane Katrina, refugees became evacuees.</p>
<p>6. Derivative (2007)--financial instrument or analytical tool that engendered the meltdown.</p>
<p>7. <span class="companylink">Google</span> (2007)--founders misspelled actual word 'googol.'</p>
<p>8. Surge (2007)--the strategy that effectively ended the Iraq war.</p>
<p>9. Chinglish (2005)--the Chinese-English hybrid language growing larger as Chinese influence expands.</p>
<p>10. Tsunami (2004) -- the southeast Asian tsunami took 250,000 lives.</p>
<p>11. H1N1 (2009)--more commonly known as swine flu.</p>
<p>12. Subprime (2007)--subprime mortgages were another bubble to burst. 13. dot.com(2000) -- the dot.combubble engendered no lifelines, no bailouts.</p>
<p>14. Y2K (2000) -- the Year 2000: all computers would turn to pumpkins at the stroke of midnight.</p>
<p>15. Misunderestimate (2002)--one of the first and most enduring of Bushisms.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Top terms from the decade reflect challenges, tragedies; 'Global warming' leads list of phrases now in popular use</b>
</div><div>Mike Barber   </div>

<div>613 words</div><div>2 December 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>"Global warming" is the word of the decade, according to the Global Language Monitor, as the term weighed heavily over both international political discourse and helped popularize the green movement.</p>
<p>The list of the top 25 words contains a number that reflect the decade's challenges and tragedies -- 9/11, bailout, and evacuee/refugee are all in the top five -- and the increasingly connected lives we lead (<span class="companylink">Google</span>, blog, Twitter, texting, dot-com, Y2K).</p>
<p>That technology is so well represented on the list shouldn't come as a surprise to followers of the evolution of English.</p>
<p>In June, the Austin, Texas-based company deemed the one millionth word in the language to be "Web 2.0."</p>
<p>Other notables on the list, such as Chinglish (the growing English-Chinese hybrid language), slumdog (referring to slum-dwellers in Mumbai, popularized by the film Slumdog Millionaire) and tsunami, point to a world increasingly aware of developing nations such as China and India.</p>
<p>"Obama" was third on the list, but, inevitably, former U.S. president George W. Bush left a bigger mark. One of his more famous malapropisms, misunderestimate, came in at No. 15, while WMD (weapons of mass destruction) took No. 18, and quagmire -- what many had feared Iraq would become, and what Afghanistan increasingly appears to be -- was No. 24.</p>
<p>"Looking at the first decade of the 21st century in words is a sober, even sombre, event," Paul J.J. Payack, the company's president, said in a release. "For a decade that began with such joy and hope, the words chosen depict a far more complicated and in many ways, tragic time."</p>
<p>The 18th-century English writer Samuel Johnson wrote that it's laughable for a lexicographer to "imagine that his dictionary can embalm his language and secure it from corruption and decay."</p>
<p>Paul Keen, director of Carleton University's English department, agreed, saying the list "really proves just how alive language really is."</p>
<p>A term such as global warming, said Keen, represents the distillation of a complex concept into an easily remembered and evocative phrase.</p>
<p>"What needs to happen for things to become . . . an initiative that people can mobilize around is to develop a way of speaking about it.</p>
<p>"It makes the science intelligible," he said.</p>
<p>Or take bailout, another catch-all word meaning government assistance that has given unemployed autoworkers, opposition politicians and disgruntled investors a word to rally around.</p>
<p>"What we do to deal with the unfamiliar and with change is by using some of the most comfortable language we have," said Keen.</p>
<p>"It can be bad because metaphors can distort things to make them seem simpler than they are, but it can also make them more accessible to people."</p>
<p>And just in case you weren't sick of it yet, H1N1 came in at 11.</p>
<p>THE GLOBAL LANGUAGE MONITOR'S TOP WORDS OF THE DECADE:</p>
<p>1. Global Warming (2000) -- rated highly from Day 1 of the decade.</p>
<p>2. 9/11 (2001) -- another inauspicious start to the decade.</p>
<p>3. Obama (2008) -- U.S. president's name as a 'root' word or 'word stem.'</p>
<p>4. Bailout (2008) -- the bank bailout was but Act 1 of the crisis.</p>
<p>5. Evacuee/refugee (2005) -- after hurricane Katrina, refugees became evacuees.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Physicians facing disease dilemma; Experts concerned that H1N1 outbreak could fuel surge in antibiotics prescriptions</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>401 words</div><div>2 December 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Infectious disease experts worry the H1N1 virus will drive a surge in antibiotic prescribing, potentially leading to more drug-resistant organisms.</p>
<p>As Canada enters the normal peak season for flu, doctors are facing a perennial problem: how to distinguish flu from rare and grave bacterial infections such as meningitis and serious Group A streptococcal infections.</p>
<p>Early signs of meningitis include some of the same symptoms recommended in screening questions for H1N1, including fever, sore throat, headache, muscle aches, vomiting and diarrhea, two doctors writing in the British Medical Journal warned recently.</p>
<p>Bacterial infections need to be treated with antibiotics. Should doctors face what they term "diagnostic uncertainty," doctors will prescribe the antibiotics as well as an anti-viral medicine, such as Tamiflu, just in case.</p>
<p>While flu activity is falling, officials warned Tuesday that H1N1 is far from gone, and the number of visits to doctors nationwide for flu-like symptoms have been at levels not seen in 12 years.</p>
<p>"What's going to happen now with H1N1 is physicians are going to see more people whom they can't distinguish," said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>"They're therefore going to prescribe antibiotics for them, so they're going to prescribe antibiotics for a lot of people with influenza. What the H1N1 outbreak is going to drive is a substantial surge in antibiotic prescribing, which is then going to result in more antibiotic resistance."</p>
<p>McGeer understands the dilemma. "You see somebody in your office who is on day four [of illness], they've still got a fever, they've got green [secretions from their nose], and you look at them and you think, they might be developing a bacterial infection. And so you treat them with antibiotics for insurance.</p>
<p>"But it's really just influenza, that's what influenza does. The problem is you can't tell that absolutely, and in order to be sure you give them an antibiotic," she said. "A big piece of it is about teaching people about the natural history of influenza, what it's supposed to look like, and understanding when you should, and should not intervene with antibiotics."</p>
<p>But the flip side is the risk of misdiagnosing serious bacterial infections as H1N1.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>There's no escape from our paranoia</b>
</div><div>PAT DONNELLY   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>637 words</div><div>2 December 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>C5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Terrorism is a state of mind that exists within us all, and our paranoia about it can be psychologically destructive.</p>
<p>That's the essence of what the brotherly Russian writing team of Oleg and Vladimir Presnyakov are trying to get across in their play Terrorisme, now playing in French at Aux Écuries - the only theatre in town currently offering surgical masks to spectators. (The intention is purely ironic, a means of underlining the H1N1 panic factor.)</p>
<p>The concept is in keeping with a play that grapples with the collective psyche of post-Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Terrorisme, which has arrived in Montreal via a Belgian/Québécois co-production directed by Belgian Olivier Coyette, is not easily deciphered through translation and a performance style that heightens absurdity to a European comedic extreme. Think Gogol meets Beckett in Belgium.</p>
<p>The play is bookended with airport scenes that evoke memories of Robert Lepage's Zulu Time, which had to be cancelled in New York in 2001 because the World Trade towers were destroyed just before the premiere.</p>
<p>Terrorisme, too, was written prior to 9/11, although its Moscow premiere didn't take place until 2002. It was subsequently picked up by the Royal Court Theatre in London in 2003 and has since been produced around the world, including off-Broadway in New York in 2005.</p>
<p>Why? Unfortunately, in spite of some bravura performances, this production fails to answer that question.</p>
<p>The play begins with an irate businessman (Fabien Cloutier) arguing with an airport security guard who is calmly munching grapes. The airport has been shut down because of a bomb scare. Two fellow passengers in identical red suits torment the man. He decides to return home to wait. Anxiety sets in when his wife doesn't pick up the phone.</p>
<p>Actors shuffle the modular set to create a bedroom where a man in a spandex swimsuit (Mani Soleymanlou) and a woman in a tutu (Sharon Ibgui) act out their sexual fantasies, including bondage, while her husband is away on business. They are interrupted by a phone call, but continue with their increasingly violent games.</p>
<p>This segues into a prolonged scene in an office (which seems more like an asylum) overseen by a guy in squeaky shoes and a psychotherapist with a dog costume hanging from his head. When they discover that a woman betrayed by her husband has hanged herself, it triggers more hysteria than compassion. One man pees his pants.</p>
<p>After intermission, we meet two older women in a park. The one who is looking after her grandchild (Nicole Valberg) dislikes her son-in-law. The other one (Monique Miller), who seethes with hatred for foreigners, confides that she poisoned her husband. The businessman from the first scene rushes in, interrupting their conversation, looking distraught.</p>
<p>Next up, a locker room where an anti-terrorism squad is shown relaxing by roughing up a fellow officer (Benoit van Dorslaer) after dragging him naked out of the shower. He fights back, gouging the eyes of his attacker. The commander (Christian Crahay) breaks it up, pontificates, reams out the guy who has hoarded a grisly photo of dead bodies on an exploded bed.</p>
<p>In the final scene, the businessman is finally buckling up on an airplane. Was it all a flashback, or a wildly fragmented dream? No certainty allowed here. Just a bombardment of incidents.</p>
<p>Terrorisme, by Oleg and Vladimir Presnyakov, translated by Anne-Catherine Lebeau, continues at Aux Écuries, 7285 Chabot St., until Dec. 12. Tickets: $20, $15 students and seniors. Call 514-328-7437 or visit www.auxecuries.com[http://www.auxecuries.com].</p>

<p>British Columbians should still be vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus despite an apparent slowdown in infection rates, the chief provincial health officer said yesterday.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall said he hopes people who haven't been vaccinated yet will receive their shots. "It's a truly good thing you can do for yourself and for the people you come into contact with.</p>
<p>"Plus, if you are vaccinated, you are not going to have to worry about influenza spoiling your [Christmas] holidays," Kendall said.</p>
<p>Eight British Columbians have died from the H1N1 virus over the past week in B.C., the B.C. Centre for Disease Control said yesterday.</p>
<p>Kendall said visits to doctors of patients reporting flu-like illnesses have dropped to between one and two per cent of total visits. Weeks ago, that number was as high as 10 per cent. "That's a significant drop."</p>
<p>But Kendall also said one to two per cent is still high for this time of year.</p>
<p>Since Nov. 24, 93 new severe cases of H1N1 have been confirmed in B.C., with 45 of them on Vancouver Island. Yesterday, three severe cases were being treated at Vancouver Island hospitals, two of them on ventilators.</p>
<p>In total, 957 cases -- 119 of them on the Island -- have been confirmed in B.C. since April, when the first wave of H1N1 arrived. The province is now in the second wave, which began in September when children returned to school.</p>
<p>To date, 42 people with confirmed cases of H1N1 have died in B.C. -- including eight on Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>Kendall said people who were sick with an influenza-like illness should not assume that they have built up a natural immunity. Such people have only a 50-50 chance that they were infected with H1N1. It could just as likely have been one of several other, cold-type viruses now in circulation.</p>
<p>"Don't take a chance thinking you are immune," Kendall said. "Unless you had a positive lab test [confirming an H1N1 infection], my best advice is to get vaccinated."</p>
<p>Kendall also said B.C.'s vaccine-supply issues should start to ease, with 635,000 doses now distributed, or on their way, to local health authorities. A further 753,000 is expected next week.</p>

<p>China lifts pork ban</p>
<p>China has reopened its borders to imports of Canadian pork - a possible signal of goodwill as Prime Minister Stephen Harper flies to visit the Asian giant for his first official visit.</p>
<p>The huge Chinese market was closed to Canadian pork products in May after the swine flu virus was found in pigs on an Alberta farm.</p>
<p>Junior agriculture minister Pierre Lemieux said it was "great news for our pork producers, who now have renewed access to a $50 million-a-year market."</p>

<p>$500M for pension plan</p>
<p>Canada's second-largest railway company, Canadian Pacific, says it will use cash on hand to make a $500 million voluntary prepayment to its defined benefit pension plan.</p>
<p>The Calgary-based company says the payment will reduce the amount it will have to pay toward its pension plans in 2010.</p>

<p>Insurer buys EDC HQ</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Manulife Financial</span>, Canada's largest insurance company, is buying the new headquarters building of <span class="companylink">Export Development Canada</span> in downtown Ottawa.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the purchase from a joint venture of <span class="companylink">Broccolini Construction Inc</span>. and The Canderel Group of Companies were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The transaction is scheduled to close at the end of 2011 following completion of the 18-storey, 44,500-square-metre building at the corner of Slater and O'Connor streets.</p>
<p>EDC, Canada's export credit agency, is consolidating its operations from two neighbouring buildings and will occupy 100 per cent of the building's office space under a long-term lease which will extend to 2031.</p>
<p>Aerospace</p>
<p>Jet production to fall</p>
<p>Canada's aerospace industry has fared better than other manufacturing sectors through the recession but the effects of lower demand, especially for business jets, will constrain a recovery until 2011, the Conference Board of Canada said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Production is forecast to decline by 2.1 per cent this year and by 2.3 per cent in 2010 before growing about 3.5 per cent annually through 2014.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Bombardier Aerospace</span> last week announced the layoff of 715 Montreal-area employees next year as it reduces production of regional jets.</p>
<p>That's in addition to 4,360 layoffs announced earlier this year around the world, including more than 1,700 in Montreal, because of lower jet orders.</p>
<p>Despite decreased demand, pre-tax profits are expected to reach $461 million in 2009, thanks to the weaker Canadian dollar at the beginning of the year, the Conference Board said.</p>
<p>USA Today</p>
<p>26 jobs fall under axe</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Gannett Co</span>. is cutting 26 newsroom jobs at its flagship USA Today newspaper and 11 positions at USA Weekend magazine.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear what percentage of the workforce the positions represent.</p>
<p>USA Today and other Gannett newspapers have already tried to cut costs with layoffs and furloughs over the past year.</p>
<p>USA Today has been hit especially hard by the advertising slump and a decline in travel, which knocked it out of the No. 1 position in American daily newspaper circulation.</p>

<p>MDs not on-board with foreign recognition plan</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Jason Kenney is singling out doctors for not co-operating with federal efforts to speed up recognition of foreign credentials.</p>
<p>The government announced a plan this week that would give some foreign-trained workers an answer within a year whether their credentials will be recognized in Canada.</p>
<p>But the professions in the first phase of the framework include only architects, engineers, pharmacists, physio and occupational therapists and registered nurses.</p>
<p>Kenney said the medical profession was reluctant to come to the table, despite the shortage of doctors in Canada.</p>

<p>Canadian H1N1 vaccine available worldwide</p>
<p>GlaxoSmithKline says the world health body has certified its Canadian H1N1 flu vaccine.</p>
<p>That makes it available for donors to buy for developing countries.</p>
<p>Last month, the firm advised health authorities to discontinue use of a batch of the Canadian-made vaccine over concerns it could trigger life-threatening reactions.</p>
<p>The vaccine contains an adjuvant, a chemical compound to boost the immune system.</p>

<p>Nokia is willing to pay more for Nortel assets</p>
<p>TORONTO Nokia Siemens has asked a U.S. bankruptcy court to reject Ciena Corp. as the winning bidder for Nortel Networks' optical networking and carrier Ethernet businesses and suggested it would be willing to pay more.</p>
<p>Nokia Siemens and its partner One Equity Partners said yesterday they would be willing to pay $810 million in cash for the business.</p>
<p>The offer would top the $530 million US in cash plus $239 million US of convertible notes due June 2017 that made up Ciena's winning bid for what was considered one of Nortel's more-prized units.</p>
<p>A hearing to approve the sale of the division to Ciena is scheduled for today.</p>

<p>UPS distribution centre doubles with expansion</p>
<p>MISSISSAUGA Parcel delivery company UPS Canada officially opened its expanded distribution centre yesterday after a $72-million expansion that has doubled the size of the operation just north of Toronto.</p>
<p>The company, a unit of Georgia-based United Parcel Service, said the new operation will help boost the company's business by using technology to simplify the import and export of goods through customs and by attracting new small-business customers. The expanded distribution hub is about the size of eight football fields and employs about 2,000 people.</p>

<p>China reopens its borders to Canadian pork</p>
<p>OTTAWA China has reopened its borders to imports of Canadian pork -- a possible signal of goodwill as Prime Minister Stephen Harper flies to visit the Asian giant for his first official visit.</p>
<p>The Chinese market was closed to Canadian pork products in May after the swine flu virus was found in pigs on an Alberta farm. China continues to ban live swine imports.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that consuming pork products can transmit the swine flu, a point Canada has emphasized in negotiations with China over the pork ban.</p>

</p>
<p>MANY Manitobans will be able to get the H1N1 vaccination from their own doctors as four more Winnipeg clinics get set to close Monday.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu shot is being delivered to doctors' offices across the province, the next step in the province's plan to make the vaccine accessible to as many Manitobans as possible, Health Minister Theresa Oswald announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Getting a flu shot in a doctor's office is a familiar process for many people and now that we have enough vaccine, we're offering this option to physicians and Manitobans," Oswald said in a press release.</p>
<p>Some doctors' offices do not have the refrigeration facilities to store the vaccine, so patients will have to contact their family doctors individually to find out whether the vaccine is available there.</p>
<p>So far, 217,685 Winnipeggers have been vaccinated and the eight city clinics are reporting minimal wait times.</p>
<p>Three clinics will run this Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Starting Monday, the Winnipeg Health Region will cut back to only four clinics running from 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday through Thursday and from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Friday.</p>
<p>It's the final week for vaccination clinics at these locations:</p>
<p>St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church (2255 Grant Ave.)</p>
<p>Portage Place Shopping Centre (393 Portage Ave.)</p>
<p>U of M, Fort Garry Campus (Room 210, 2nd floor University Centre)</p>
<p>Holy Eucharist Parish Centre (460 Munroe Ave.)</p>
<p>These clinics will remain open Saturday and next week:</p>
<p>Grant Park Shopping Centre (1120 Grant Ave.)</p>
<p>Indo-Canadian Arts & Cultural Centre (479 St. Mary's Rd.)</p>
<p>Garden City Shopping Centre (2305 McPhillips St.)</p>
<p>This clinic is open Monday to Friday next week.</p>
<p>St. Paul the Apostle Parish Centre (2400 Portage Ave.)</p>
<p>Nearly 30 per cent of Manitobans have been vaccinated during the second H1N1 wave, including:</p>
<p>54,675 people with chronic health conditions;</p>
<p>27,493 children between the ages of six months and under five, and 56,148 children aged five to 18;</p>
<p>23,863 people who live with or care for others who can't be vaccinated, including infants under six months of age or people with weakened immune systems;</p>
<p>16,198 health-care providers;</p>
<p>34,711 people in the Burntwood Regional Health Authority (more than 74 per cent of the region's population), which was particularly hard-hit in the spring;</p>
<p>more than 48,000 people living on First Nations (an average of 57 per cent), with some First Nations reporting vaccination rates over 90 per cent; and</p>
<p>3,385 pregnant women.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tariff on Chinese steel hot topic for Harper's visit</b>
</div><div>CAROLYNNE WHEELER   </div>
<div>SPECIAL TO THE GLOBE AND MAIL</div>
<div>529 words</div><div>2 December 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>B9</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>BEIJING -- Chinese officials are criticizing Canada for a major increase in tariffs on some Chinese steel products, just ahead of Prime Minister Stephen Harper's first visit to the country.</p>
<p>“We hope when we encounter trade disputes or frictions we should resolve them in friendly consultations instead of resorting to trade sanctions or duties, which is not conducive to trade ties between two countries,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters in Beijing yesterday.</p>
<p>Last month, the Canada Border Services Agency imposed a preliminary duty of up to 182 per cent on some Chinese steel products, mainly piping, used in the oil and gas industry, after determining the products had been subsidized or dumped in the Canadian market.</p>
<p>The Canadian complaint was launched by Welland, Ont.-based <span class="companylink">Lakeside Steel Inc</span>., along with steel producers <span class="companylink">Tenaris</span> and Evras. “We just feel that there are certain Chinese imports that are dumped and unfairly subsidized that are coming into the Canadian market,” Randy Sockovie, Lakeside's director of sales and marketing, told The Canadian Press. A final ruling is expected in February.</p>
<p>China has faced similar accusations of dumping of steel products from both the United States and European Union. Last month, the U.S. said it would impose tariffs of up to 99 per cent on some Chinese steel pipe imports. China then responded by announcing an investigation into dumping of U.S. cars and auto parts.</p>
<p>Anti-dumping cases against Chinese firms are expected to escalate in coming months as the country's massive stimulus package fuels excess capacity in its industry and its currency, the yuan, remains pegged to the U.S. dollar at artificially low rates, making Chinese exports more affordable.</p>
<p>China has so far resisted pressure to ease its currency policy, while criticizing other countries for protectionism.</p>
<p>“Some countries demand the yuan's appreciation while practising various trade protectionism against China. It's unfair and actually limits China's development,” Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao told reporters earlier this week.</p>
<p>China is expected to raise the new steel tariff in talks with Mr. Harper today after his arrival in Beijing. It is Mr. Harper's first official visit to China in his nearly four years as Prime Minister. The political relationship has, at times, been a difficult one, and Canadian businesses with ties to China are looking to Mr. Harper's delegation to mend fences.</p>
<p>“We hope the two sides will exchange in-depth views on bilateral relations, especially economic ties, and we hope the visit will yield positive progress,” Mr. Qin said.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, China lifted its ban on imports of pork products from Canada, as well as from the U.S. and Mexico. The ban was imposed earlier this year amid fears of the spread of the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>However, import restrictions on Canadian canola remain in place. China worries that Canadian oilseed will infect its domestic crop with a common fungal disease, known as blackleg, from major ports and has restricted shipments to ports situated away from agricultural areas.</p>

</p>
<p>The death toll in B.C. from the H1N1 flu continues to mount.</p>
<p>The province's Ministry of Healthy Living announced Tuesday that eight people have died from H1N1 flu since Nov. 24 -- double the four deaths announced in the previous week.</p>
<p>The eight new deaths bring the total in B.C. since the disease first showed up in April to 42.</p>
<p>Twenty new deaths related to the current H1N1 flu outbreak were reported by Public Health Agency of Canada Tuesday, bringing the nationwide death toll to 329.</p>
<p>Four of the new deaths in the province were recorded in the Fraser Health region. There were two each in Interior Health and on Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>There were 93 new severe cases of H1N1 reported in the province in the last week, bringing the total of severe cases confirmed by the B.C. Centre for Disease Control since April to 957.</p>
<p>The 93 new severe cases were broken down by region as follows: 45 on Vancouver Island, 21 in Interior Health, 13 in Vancouver Coastal Health, nine in Fraser Health and five in Northern Health.</p>
<p>Since April, the greatest number of severe cases has been recorded in the Fraser Health region with 346, followed by Vancouver Coastal with 243, Interior with 206, Vancouver Island with 119 and Northern Health with 43.</p>
<p>"The majority of lab-confirmed cases in B.C. have been mild or moderate in severity, with the patients either having already recovered or currently recovering," said a B.C. health ministry release.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall, B.C.'s chief health officer, has warned residents against becoming complacent over swine flu and has "strongly" urged people to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Kendall has predicted a third wave of flu next spring.</p>
<p>National concern was heightened Tuesday with release of a study noting Canadian airports are serving as "major gateways for infectious diseases."</p>
<p>The report, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, singled out Toronto as the "most vulnerable point of entry in Canada," followed by Vancouver International Airport.</p>
<p>It suggested that more flu screening is required at airports, that thermal sensors be used to detect the body heat of passengers, and that passenger screenings be increased.</p>

</p>
<p>In regards to flu prevention, now seems like a good time for some points on handwashing, hygiene, and etiquette --especially considering our government's "Vaccine for everybody!" (by next July) policy.</p>
<p>1) Washing your hands is pointless if you turn off the dirty tap and pull the dirty door handle with your "clean hands" afterwards. Use a paper towel to turn off the water, and another to open the door. If there's no waste bin within reach, toss the paper on the floor and just get out without touching anything with your hands. Use your sleeve, jacket, or foot if you have to.</p>
<p>Hand sanitizer? If you believe you can sanitize the poop on your hands, then I'm a Nigerian prince. (Send me money.) It is useful, but be realistic.</p>
<p>2) The simplest and best hygienic measure is wearing loose, long sleeves. Now you have a good place to sneeze (your elbow), and a ready buffer to put between your hand and public germ- distribution centers, like Interac keypads, door handles, etc. Just pull your sleeve down until it covers your fingertips.</p>
<p>3) Are you in charge? Redesign your public bathrooms for idiot-proof hygiene. Make your H1N1 employees stay home for a full week. (Help them cope financially.) Make sure the person putting a lid on my coffee is not the same person who is handling money! Say it, don't spray it! Don't initiate handshakes! Nobody wants to shake your hand!</p>
<p>Thank you for not infecting me!</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>The local health unit will continue to provide both H1N1 and seasonal flu shots at community clinics until Friday, Dec. 11.</p>
<p>With the exception of a clinic scheduled in Drayton, on Dec. 16, the community clinics will close at that time. Starting Dec. 14, residents can get flu shots at Public Health offices. Many physicians are also offering H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccine for their patients.</p>
<p>"The message hasn't changed," says Dr. Nicola Mercer, Medical Officer of Health. "After getting your flu shots, it takes about 10 to 14 days to develop immunity. As we head into a season of social gatherings and holiday travel, ensure the fullest protection for yourself and your family - get both H1N1 and seasonal flu shots."</p>
<p>For flu clinic schedules and other flu information go to www.wdghu.org[http://www.wdghu.org] or call the Flu Hotline at 1-800-265-7293 ext. 4161 weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Follow the twitter feed on the website to find out approximate wait times at the clinics.</p>

<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>The region's third death from H1N1 has been confirmed by public health.</p>
<p>All three men had underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>Region of Waterloo Public Health announced Monday a man over 50 died of the flu virus strain. Earlier in November, the deaths of another man over 50 and a man under 50 were attributed to H1N1.</p>
<p>"It's extremely unfortunate every time there is a death, even though most cases remain mild to moderate," said associate medical officer of health Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang.</p>
<p>Although the H1N1 flu virus is significantly less active in the region than a few weeks ago, Wang urges people to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>H1N1 is the predominant strain circulating, which means the vast majority of people sick with influenza have H1N1.</p>
<p>The majority of the region's doctors continue to offer the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Another community immunization clinic was also added to the schedule for next week, leaving at least four more for people to get their shot.</p>
<p>"We're still seeing good demand at our clinics," said Wang, adding that public health will decide later this week if more clinic dates need to be added.</p>
<p>Healthy children age three to nine need one half-dose of the adjuvanted vaccine - a change from earlier recommendations. Children six months to under three need two half-doses, a minimum of 21 days apart. Those three to nine with chronic medical conditions also require two shots.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sports, social networking top Canadian searches in 2009; Michael Jackson tops list of celebrity searches along with Megan Fox, Susan Boyle</b>

</p>
<p>Canadians are becoming more interested in social networking, but we also like to keep up on our favourite sports. At least, that's the impression one gets after taking a look at the year's top search terms, released by two of the country's most popular search engines.</p>
<p>“Facebook” was the most popular search typed into Google Canada this year, according to the company, with “Youtube” and classified-ad site “Kijiji” also cracking the top ten. In the list of fastest rising searches, a category that compares this year to 2008, “Twitter” took the top spot, with “Craigslist” also making the list.</p>
<p>Searches on Yahoo! Canada put the spotlight on the country's love affair with rough sports: “NHL” was the most searched term on the site, followed closely by people looking for ultimate fighting and professional wrestling. NASCAR and “NBA” also made Yahoo's Canada top ten.</p>
<p>When it comes to the celebrities, Canadians shared many of the same interests as American searchers. The death of Michael Jackson propelled his name to the top of Yahoo! Canada's most popular people list. In the US, the King of Pop was the top search term overall on Yahoo! and Bing (which didn't release Canadian search stats), and made it on to Google's top news searches. Other celebrities that caught the attention on both sides of the border included Transformers 2 star Megan Fox, breakout British singer Susan Boyle and R&B artist Rhianna.</p>
<p>Aside from reading up on celebrities, Canadians took to the web to get information on the year's big news stories. Not surprisingly, influenza was one topic searchers wanted to learn more about. It took three spots on Google Canada's top news searches (“Swine flu” at number one, and “H1N1” at number five and “flu” at six) as well as the most popular news search on Yahoo! Canada. (The same held true in the US, with the flu at the top of the news searches for Google and Yahoo!, and third place on Bing.) The Iranian election, Barack Obama's inauguration and the Victoria Stafford killing all also ranked high on Yahoo!'s news list.</p>

</p>
<p>The two latest H1N1 deaths in Quebec were of adults age 51 and 52 with no previous medical problems, Dr. Alain Poirier, Quebec's director of public health, said yesterday as he reiterated recent invitations for all Quebecers to be inoculated.</p>
<p>The death toll in the flu bug's second wave - which started Aug. 30 - has reached 63, Poirier added, noting that vaccination-clinic doors are open to all comers in every region of the province.</p>
<p>Most of the Health Department's indicators show that the second wave has peaked, Poirier said.</p>
<p>Traffic through Quebec's vaccination clinics was lower than capacity during the weekend, he acknowledged without providing exact figures. He suggested that about 280,000 people were vaccinated Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>As of last Thursday, statistics on a government website show slightly more than 2.4 million Quebecers had received the shot.</p>
<p>Poirier said the vaccination rate for all of Quebec - 35.7 per cent - is slightly higher than the figure for Montreal, which is 33.1 per cent.</p>
<p>Poirier said that 37 per cent of hospitalizations and 40 per cent of deaths are occurring in the 20-59 age bracket.</p>
<p>Among pregnant women, 51 per cent in the Montreal area have had the H1N1 shot, he said, vs. 55.7 per cent across the province as a whole.</p>

<p>Re: "Swann crosses the line," Editorial, Nov. 26.</p>
<p>Rarely do I agree with Dr. David Swann, particularly on political issues, but perhaps the Herald editorial board should look objectively at medical issues he has raised regarding the handling of the H1N1 immunization in Alberta. It would appear that the death toll in Alberta from this virus per 100,000 population is considerably higher than the death toll per 100,000 in the rest of Canada. Other provinces were quicker in immunizing those at risk. From a medical perspective, the question must be asked whether the handling of immunization was a factor in Alberta's increased mortality.</p>

</div><div>Michael Traikos   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service; with files from The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>894 words</div><div>1 December 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Early</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>After picking up back-to-back wins on the road last week, the Toronto Maple Leafs returned home on Monday. But the players, which had combined for 10 goals against the Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers, appeared to leave their sticks in customs.</p>
<p>Led by Ryan Miller's 37 saves, the Buffalo Sabres shutout the Leafs 3-0 at Air Canada Centre.</p>
<p>The loss dropped Toronto's record to a league-worst 2-7-3 at home, where the team has managed only 1.9 goals per game. But the good news is that the Leafs, who are 4-5-4 on the road with 3.4 goals per game, have already packed their bags for a three-game trip that starts on Tuesday against the Montreal Canadiens.</p>
<p>That Toronto was unable to put the puck in the net was not all that surprising.</p>
<p>In their prior home game, the Leafs had fired a season-high 61 shots against the New York Islanders on Nov. 23. But they managed to beat goaltender Dwayne Roloson only three times in a 4-3 overtime loss. On Monday, the team faced the NHL's best netminder.</p>
<p>Miller, who has won 16 of 21 games this season, headed into the game with a league-leading 1.93 goals-against average and .933 save percentage.</p>
<p>Considering that the Leafs' inability to score at home, the odds seemed to be in the Sabres' favour. The goaltenders were the story in a scoreless first period that featured a combined 22 shots.</p>
<p>Miller had to work for each of his 12 saves. The most impressive came during a goalmouth scramble, when the Michigan native reached behind his body and swatted a puck that seemed destined for the back of the net. At the other end of the ice, Toronto's Jonas Gustavsson looked like Gumby as he stretched his lanky six-foot-three body around the crease making pad save after pad save.</p>
<p>By the second period, it appeared as though both goaltenders were in the shooters' heads.</p>
<p>Moments after he was unable to pull the trigger on a rebound in the crease, Leafs forward Matt Stajan flubbed a two-on-none by passing the puck into Phil Kessel's skates. Kessel, who fired four shots in the first two periods, also seemed snake bitten. He was staring at an open net from the side of the crease when Miller came out of nowhere and kicked robbed the winger with a pad save.</p>
<p>With Miller stopping all 28 shots he faced through 40 minutes, Tim Kennedy gave the Sabres a 1-0 lead midway through the second period.</p>
<p>It was an admittedly lucky goal. Andrej Sekera had been skating down the right wing when a Leafs defenceman broke up his centering pass. The puck fortuitously went to Kennedy, whose backhand attempt banked in off the back of Gustavsson's skate.</p>
<p>The Sabres should have scored another. But, like the Leafs, they had difficulty finishing their chances.</p>
<p>At the end of the second period, the Leafs were not only down a goal, but also a defenceman. Carl Gunnarsson, who had played himself into the top-four after starting the season in the minors, left the game with an upper-body injury after colliding awkwardly towards the end boards.</p>
<p>A mere 20 seconds had expired in the third period when the Sabres extended their lead on a blast from the point from Henrik Tallinder. This was a shot that Gustavsson, who had been solid in the first two periods, should have stopped. But with several of his teammates in the shooting lane, the Leafs goaltender looked like he lost sight of the puck.</p>
<p>QMJHL reschedules Olympiques game</p>
<p>Last week's Quebec Major Junior Hockey League game between the Gatineau Olympiques and Val d'Or Foreurs, cancelled after several members of the Foreurs either came down with H1N1 or were showing symptoms of the flu virus, has been rescheduled for March.</p>
<p>The Foreurs will host their Western Division rival at Centre <span class="companylink">Air Creebec</span> on March 2. Gatineau (15-10-0-2) sits second in the division with 32 points -- five back of the first-place Rouyn-Noranda Huskies, who have played five more games.</p>
<p>Top week for Spooner</p>
<p>Forward Ryan Spooner of the Peterborough Petes was named Ontario Hockey League player of the week Monday.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old from Kanata enjoyed four-point nights in two of three games and finished the week with eight points overall along with a rating of plus-2.</p>
<p>Spooner is currently ranked 11th in league scoring with 37 points (12 goals, 25 assists) in 29 games.</p>

<p>FINANCIAL SERVICES REPORTER</p>
<p>If retailers want Canadians to spend freely this holiday season and give the economy a jolt of festive cheer, they should keep their fingers crossed for a major Hollywood scandal in the next week or two.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span> launches a new index today to track consumer sentiment, and the research that went into it suggests that consumers are more likely to shop when the media is focused on something other than the economy and troubled banks.</p>
<p>Consumer confidence in Canada took a sharp downturn last fall and early this year during the financial meltdown, when the news headlines were dominated by job losses, the stock market crash and the crises in the auto and financial sectors.</p>
<p>But the consumer outlook began to perk up in late January, once the nightly news shifted to the H1N1 flu. That was no accident, says John Wright, senior vice-president at Ipsos Reid Corp., which is working on the new index.</p>
<p>“The next time we actually saw confidence come back was during the time that Michael Jackson died [in June],” he said. “And the reason for that, again, was that the media coverage was interrupted by another event.”</p>
<p>But it's not only headlines that influence. Advertisements do, too.</p>
<p>“It was almost an institutionalized pessimism that came about with all of the advertising that started around the same time and always began with ‘With tough economic times…' ” Mr. Wright said.</p>
<p>With consumers accounting for roughly 60 per cent of Canada's economy, sentiment is not a trivial matter. The bank decided to launch the new monthly index, called the RBC Canadian Consumer Outlook, because its executives felt that none of the consumer sentiment measures that currently exist in Canada were timely and thorough enough. The RBC survey includes more than 30 questions.</p>
<p>Consumers are currently optimistic, but there is still a high level of anxiety, especially when it comes to jobs, said David McKay, head of Canadian banking at RBC.</p>
<p>Today's inaugural report, based on an online survey of 1,018 people aged 18 and over between Nov. 9 and Nov. 16, found that Canadians are more optimistic about how things will be a year from now than they are about the very near future.</p>
<p>Consumers plan to tighten their belts over the holidays, with about half planning to spend less than last year and 18 per cent saying they will not buy any gifts at all. On average, Canadians expect to spend $1,218 on holiday purchases.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven per cent of those polled think their personal financial situation will improve in the next three months, while 38 per cent expect their situation to improve in the next year.</p>
<p>Canadians say a recovery in the employment market is what will make them more optimistic once again.</p>
<p>“We're certainly launching this index at what we hope is the end of a difficult economic period,” Mr. McKay said. “We're hoping it's close to the bottom.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Keep it steady is NDP mantra - Priority spending, belt-tightening, too</b>
</div><div>By Bruce Owen and Larry Kusch    </div>
<div>1316 words</div><div>1 December 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>Premier Greg Selinger is banking on a wide-ranging blueprint -- that will help put a police helicopter in the sky, bring aid to orphaned polar bears and help Manitobans get fit -- to put his stamp on the province.</p>
<p>Selinger's first throne speech as premier is a cautious document containing few surprises as the NDP government heads into a period of declining federal transfer payments and uncertain tax revenues from a flat economy.</p>
<p>The premier called it a "steady as she goes" road map for the coming year.</p>
<p>The biggest highlight -- and one that was not condemned by the opposition -- was confirmation the province is willing to sit down with the City of Winnipeg to negotiate the purchase of a specially outfitted police helicopter as well as the cost of operating it.</p>
<p>A police helicopter, with an infrared system, is estimated to cost up to $3 million and the annual operating costs will run about $1 million. The city wants the province to pick up that annual cost.</p>
<p>"We're willing to discuss that with them," Selinger said Monday. "If that's the final agreement we arrive at, that'll be fine. We'll work out the specifics with them."</p>
<p>A second law-and-order initiative came out of the blue. Selinger said the province will introduce legislation to prevent the introduction of armoured gang vehicles in the province. Police in other Canadian cities, such as Vancouver, have already seen vehicles outfitted with armour, surveillance cameras and bulletproof glass. In June, Alberta passed a law allowing police to seize armoured vehicles used by gang members.</p>
<p>But apart from these initiatives -- and a few others such as a new tax credit to help with the cost of fertility treatments and property tax deferrals for cottage owners -- the speech was dominated by rehashed announcements and incremental improvements to existing programs.</p>
<p>And there were also warnings about potential rough economic waters ahead. The government predicted Monday that the provincial economy would contract 0.2 per cent this year, compared with an average growth of 2.7 per cent in the previous five years. At the same time, Manitoba faces large unexpected costs, including $105 million to battle H1N1 influenza and $45 million for fighting last spring's flood.</p>
<p>"We are managing these fiscal pressures by targeting spending to priority services and tightening our belts in all other areas," said the throne speech, read by newly appointed Lt.-Gov. Philip Lee. Most government departments will spend below budget -- but the province will need to dip into its $864-million "rainy day fund" to balance the books.</p>
<p>Selinger told reporters the tough economic situation -- more details are to released by the end of the year -- could mean some projects are phased in slower than first anticipated. But he declined to say which ones.</p>
<p>He did, however, sprinkle the throne speech with promises he first made on the NDP leadership campaign trail, such as offering tuition fee rebates to post-secondary students while they're still in school and building 1,500 social-housing units over the next five years.</p>
<p>The speech left the opposition asking, 'Is that all?'</p>
<p>"It was a speech that was very long on problems and short on solutions," said Conservative Leader Hugh McFadyen, who added he found it "unbelievable" that the government failed to mention the province's "economic engine," <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>.</p>
<p>"That was quite a striking omission... It just appears to us they're so embarrassed about their record on Hydro that they can't even bring themselves to mention it in a throne speech," McFadyen said.</p>
<p>Winnipeg police Chief Keith McCaskill, who attended the throne speech, said Selinger's words were the first signal the province approves acquiring a helicopter for the city.</p>
<p>The premier said the cost of the chopper would equal 30 additional police officers.</p>
<p>"It's a great thing for Winnipeg," McCaskill said. "I'm really pleased that the government has said what they have said, but it will be between political powers that be as far as financing."</p>
<p>McCaskill said if talks go well, the helicopter could be in the air late 2010. The city has been looking at getting a helicopter for almost a decade, following the lead of Edmonton and Calgary which have had police in the sky for years.</p>
<p>McCaskill said despite the initial cost, it will allow police to deploy resources more effectively, particularly in pursuits, ground searches and high-priority calls that require immediate police response.</p>
<p>Talks are continuing within the provincial government about getting a helicopter ambulance to operate in southern Manitoba. During last spring's flood, an Alberta air ambulance company was hired to operate here, a decision many say led to the saving of two lives: a woman in a highway crash and a young boy who almost drowned in a dugout.</p>
<p>The cost of an air ambulance helicopter is considerable. Last week, the Saskatchewan government said it was shelving a plan to get one as it would cost more than $42 million to buy and $9 million a year to operate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, McCaskill said police have not seen armoured gang vehicles in Winnipeg, but it's a good idea to get in front of a criminal trend before it becomes a problem.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>As demand for H1N1 vaccine wanes, clinics are starting to shut down</b>

<p>Vaccination clinics across Ontario are closing their doors because fewer people are getting the H1N1 shot and clinic employees need to return to their regular programs.</p>
<p>Hamilton has been shutting down its clinics one by one – the last will close on Friday.</p>
<p>Hamilton's associate medical officer, Christopher Mackie, said the city no longer needs the public clinics because there has been a decline in illness rates.</p>
<p>“The way influenza epidemics work is that they infect as many people as they can until the population immunity level reaches a point where they won't spread any more,” he said.</p>
<p>He said this can happen in one of two ways: the infection itself that generates immunity in those who contract it, and the vaccine.</p>
<p>“Both of those things are happening here. We've seen a high rate of infection and we've had a lot of people who got the shot. Once the population is immune enough to stop the outbreak, it starts to slow down.”</p>
<p>Dr. Mackie said this is evident in many areas in Ontario.</p>
<p>But increased H1N1 immunity is not the only reason for clinic closings. Workers from regular health programs have moved to the clinics to greet, vaccinate and supervise those who are there to get the shot.</p>
<p>“It involves our entire health unit staff, not just our team that normally does immunizations,” said Perth District Health spokeswoman Chera Longston. “So all other health programs have stopped, and we need to resume normal activities and we need to get back to normal here. We can't go on forever.”</p>
<p>Perth vaccination clinics will close today.</p>
<p>Dr. Mackie expressed similar reasoning: “We want to get back to the things we normally do that we feel are more important in the long run for the health of our community.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, Toronto closed two of its clinics because traffic has declined.</p>
<p>Immunization will continue through other means in Ontario. Vaccines have been delivered to the vast majority of family doctors and small walk-in clinics. Dr. Mackie still advises people to get it now, and after the mass public clinics close.</p>
<p>“It's not as important as it was a few weeks ago when we opened to the general public, but it's a very safe vaccine, and there's still some residual risk of acquiring an H1N1 infection, so why not?”</p>
<p>Other large health districts across the country do not plan to shut their vaccination clinics in the immediate future. Halifax, Vancouver and Winnipeg are all planning to keep their clinics open until mid-December, or depending on need.</p>

<p>GREG Selinger's debut throne speech was the new premier's first chance to show his stuff, a perfect time for a former finance minister and now leader to put his mark on the management of the province. But as with so much Mr. Selinger has said to date, this blueprint is mostly about what is familiar, and the dressing up of potentially distressing news as opportunities.</p>
<p>Mr. Selinger's primary message was that the global recession was affecting Manitoba's spending plans. He announced Monday that, except for health, family services and justice, all departments are expected to underspend their budgets this year and to spend less again next year.</p>
<p>That's prudent, but it is not remarkably new. Last year, most departments were held to small spending increases and a few saw reductions. It simply reflects that in big government, even in small provinces, there is always room to trim and to shift spending to defined priorities.</p>
<p>Still, the job before Mr. Selinger differs in one significant respect from the one former premier Gary Doer left behind. Manitoba will have to make do with less in the coming year as total federal transfers, which make up about a third of the revenues, start falling in 2010. The former finance minister declined to say how far they will dip. He refused to say if Manitoba will post an operating deficit this year, but tipped his hand in saying the $800-million-plus rainy day fund will help pay for the H1N1 pandemic strategy and last spring's flood.</p>
<p>The new premier stressed the government will ride out the recession with a strategy of stimulus tempered by restraint. The government has sped up planned infrastructure projects because that kind of spending, he stressed, is what governments do to fuel the economy, to create or maintain jobs, when everyone else spends less.</p>
<p>But for all the brave face of the throne speech, there was an ominous note for Manitoba businesses. Manitoba has rejected introducing a harmonized sales tax. During the leadership campaign, Mr. Selinger said the federal government would have to sweeten compensation to get Manitoba to sign on to an HST, which would cost the provincial treasury and Manitoba consumers each approximately $400 million a year. To date, Finance Minister Rosann Wowchuk has said an HST would not be part of the next budget. On Monday, the HST was off the agenda, period, a reminder that in Mr. Doer's departure Manitoba also lost an able federal-provincial negotiator.</p>
<p>The new premier noted himself just months ago that Manitoba businesses would be at a definable disadvantage, without an HST. A blended sales tax creates administrative savings, but also returns significant amounts of money in rebated provincial sales taxes to companies. Mr. Selinger conceded in September that this very scenario -- Manitoba as one of only two provinces without an HST -- would make it difficult to encourage companies to locate or to invest here.</p>
<p>But there is no sense, in a debut throne speech that is supposed to comfort the jittery and carry industries across the shoals, in dwelling on the negative. And so the no-HST message was painted as the government "sticking up for families."</p>
<p>Along with a re-announcement of a dozen or so projects, a promise to continue with long-planned business tax reductions and a pledge to help buy a police helicopter for the City of Winnipeg, Mr. Selinger reiterated the NDP government's tack of moving boldly forward by staying the course. It is also a plan that relies heavily on forecasts of economic recovery.</p>
<p>The days of broad tax cuts are over. With the federal cash cow gored, Manitobans will see small, token respite through limited tax credits and free entrance to provincial parks. At least, as long as the prospects for economic revival hold.</p>

</p>
<p>Our obsession with afflictions can accommodate only one set of initials at a time.</p>
<p>H1N1 is on Page 1 every day. The spotlight may shift ever so briefly for World AIDS Day tomorrow, but it's been a while, Daniella Boulay-Coppens says, since HIV was the disease of the week.</p>
<p>"HIV has been below the radar for about 10 years now," she said.</p>
<p>Below the radar, but above street level. The Centre for AIDS Services of Montreal (Women) occupies half of the third floor of what used to be École Marguerite Lemoyne on St. André St., a few blocks east of the Voyageur bus terminal.</p>
<p>A marble plaque in the front hall of the three-storey redbrick tells visitors the school was built in 1916 and run by the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame, the order that Marguerite Bourgeoys founded in 17th-century New France. There is a daycare on the first floor. The building also houses a photography studio and a documentary film company. Oak banisters line the staircase, six flights of which have to be ascended to reach the AIDS centre.</p>
<p>"It's a long trip," Boulay-Coppens said. "I usually bring something to read."</p>
<p>She has a wry sense of humour. That helps in her line of work.</p>
<p>Boulay-Coppens has been director of the AIDS centre since 1995. Her interest in HIV and commitment to alleviating suffering among its victims was piqued by the death of her brother, who succumbed to AIDS when he was 28.</p>
<p>The centre was launched in 1990 in response to the lack of services available for women living with HIV/</p>
<p>AIDS. It was created by volunteers interested in educating women about HIV/AIDS prevention and in offering support to those living with the HIV virus. It has an annual budget of $275,000, with funds derived from Centraide, the federal and provincial governments and the MAC Foundation, the philanthropic division of the progressive cosmetics company.</p>
<p>The centre will distribute 50 $125 cheques from the Gazette Christmas Fund to women who are HIV positive. Many are on welfare. Priority goes to single women with children.</p>
<p>"We try to make sure that the people who get the cheques are the ones who need it most," Boulay-Coppens said.</p>
<p>It can be a tough call. There is no shortage of need among women battling a disease and a stereotype.</p>
<p>Contrary to stereotype, HIV-positive women are not all prostitutes, heroin addicts or practitioners of promiscuity.</p>
<p>"It's not true, but that's what's in people's heads," Boulay-Coppens said. "The truth is that 60 per cent of the women we see here don't fit into those categories.</p>
<p>"They are ordinary women who've been infected by husbands who ran around."</p>
<p>Boulay-Coppens tells the story of a bank executive whose 25th wedding anniversary present was a letter from the hospital telling her she was HIV positive. Her husband, who transmitted the disease, left her.</p>
<p>"She went from being in a beautiful home to a cold-water flat," Boulay-Coppens said. "Her children turned their backs on her. Her insurance ran out.</p>
<p>"Things got better. This was a long time ago. But it's a sad case, yeah?"</p>
<p>There aren't many happy ones. The Centre for AIDS Services offers psychological counselling, support groups, "cafés rencontres" at which doctors and pharmacists bring women up to date on such topics as the importance of taking medication on a timely basis.</p>
<p>"We also do practical stuff," Boulay-Coppens said. "We've had Hydro come and tell people how to be more energy efficient. Most of the women we see are on very low income, so we give them help on how to spend their dollars."</p>
<p>Our conversation ended with a request from Boulay-Coppens. She urges parents to speak to their children about promiscuity and intravenous drug use.</p>
<p>"So many kids are getting infected because they're using dirty needles," she said. "It's scary."</p>
<p>How scary?</p>
<p>The centre has worked with an HIV-infected girl who is 12 years old. She got it from an unsanitary hypodermic.</p>
<p>"AIDS is still out there," Boulay-Coppens concluded. "Love your kids, and take care of them."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Second H1N1 wave may have peaked across Canada; Monitoring measures show a decline, but it is still unclear who is at risk</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>584 words</div><div>30 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The second wave of the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century may have peaked in Canada, according to a new analysis of flu activity nationwide.</p>
<p>The number of hospitalized cases, admissions to intensive-care units and deaths decreased in the week ending Nov. 21, the Public Health Agency of Canada said in its surveillance report.</p>
<p>The proportion of tests that were positive for flu was 34 per cent, lower than the three previous weeks. And, while the rate of flu-like illness is still much higher than expected for this time of year, every measure used to monitor the pandemic indicates flu activity is falling.</p>
<p>According to the report, "A possible epidemic peak has been reached by all provinces and territories."</p>
<p>University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown said he is hopeful the trend will continue, "and we will not see further large increases in infection."</p>
<p>People should still expect to see low levels of activity this winter, he said.</p>
<p>But the growing number of resistant people in the population, either because they were exposed to human swine flu or are being vaccinated against it, could "break the back of the pandemic" he said, "and leave most of the rest of us unscathed."</p>
<p>As recently as last Wednesday, federal officials said that while the number of H1N1 cases was "levelling off" in some parts of the country, the peak of the second wave had not yet been reached, and warned Canadians against becoming complacent.</p>
<p>"In reaching the plateau of the second wave in some communities, it does not mean the pandemic is over," said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>"There is still the other side of the peak, and there remain millions of infections to be prevented."</p>
<p>Sixty-one new deaths were reported in the week ending Nov. 21, down from 84 deaths reported the previous week. As of Nov. 26, 309 H1N1 deaths had been reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>Little is known about who is dying. From the start of a pandemic the World Health Organization warned threatened "all of humanity," people have been mostly left to ask: Who is really at risk?</p>
<p>The government provides only a brief summary, breaking cases down by sex, the median age of those who died and the proportion known to have had an underlying medical condition.</p>
<p>Even then, no information is provided on whether the pre-existing condition was something such as cystic fibrosis, or mild, well-controlled asthma.</p>
<p>It is also not clear how many of the people who have died were outside the vaccination priority groups.</p>
<p>Federal data provided to Canwest News Service show that 62 per cent of the deaths in the first wave, from April through to the end of August, occurred in those age 45 and older, and the pattern has repeated itself in the latest wave.</p>
<p>While the under-20-year-olds continue to be the ones most likely to be hospitalized with H1N1, those 45 and older have the highest death rates per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>Nationwide, those 45 and older had hospitalization rates in the second wave that were nearly five times higher than during the first wave, and the death rates for the same group have been three-times higher in the second wave compared with the first.</p>

<p>The annual Muslim hajj pilgrimage to Mecca wound up on Sunday without the feared mass outbreak of swine flu, Saudi authorities said, reporting a total of five deaths and 73 proven cases.</p>
<p>Five pilgrims died from the H1N1 flu virus during the hajj, Health Minister Abdullah al-Rabeeah said, as an estimated 2.3 million pilgrims began an exodus from Mecca, the home in western Saudi Arabia of Islam's holiest site.</p>
<p>Working with international health authorities, Saudi Arabia mounted a concerted campaign to minimise the threat and mobilized 20,000 health workers for the hajj.</p>
<p>Also, vaccines were rushed to health workers when they became available at the start of November and heat-sensing cameras were set up at airports and around the main hajj sites to detect anyone with a feverish body temperature.</p>

<div>402 words</div><div>30 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Foreign-trained architects, nurses and engineers are among new immigrants who will get first crack at having their credentials recognized within one year under a new federal-provincial accord being announced Monday.</p>
<p>Canwest News Service has learned the agreement will be implemented in two stages, and that by the end of 2012 a total of 15 occupations will have access to a fast-track system of foreign-credential recognition.</p>
<p>Human Resources Minister Diane Finley and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney are expected to lay out details of the agreement at a news conference in Toronto.</p>
<p>The Pan-Canadian Framework for the Assessment and Recognition of Foreign Credentials, as it has been named, is designed to tackle the long-standing problem of foreign-trained professionals having to struggle--sometimes for years--to have their credentials recognized in Canada. Many are forced to take jobs in fields unrelated to their expertise even at times when Canada has been plagued, for example, by shortages of nurses. Many end up abandoning the effort out of frustration.</p>
<p>Under the two-stage plan, the agreement will be implemented for eight occupations by December of next year. Aside from nurses, architects and engineers, the first group will include financial auditors and accountants, medical laboratory technologists, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.</p>
<p>This means foreign-trained workers who submit an application after that date to be licensed or registered in those fields should be advised within one year whether their credentials will be recognized.</p>
<p>The second stage, to be implemented by the end of 2012, will include physicians, dentists, engineering technicians, licensed practical nurses, medical radiation technologists and teachers for kindergarten through Grade 12.</p>
<p>The agreement commits federal, provincial and territorial governments to working toward better pre-arrival services and better and speedier assessment of newcomers' credentials in relation to standards established by Canadian professional and trade bodies.</p>
<p>The federal budget earlier this year earmarked$50 million over the next two years to make the process of assessing and recognizing foreign credentials more efficient.</p>

<p>It is good to see that the spending scandal at eHealth Ontario has not sabotaged plans to bring health records online in Eastern Ontario.</p>
<p>The eHealth scandal was about spending abuses and lack of oversight. Provincial auditor Jim McCarter concluded that Ontario taxpayers did not receive value for the $1 billion that had been invested in the project. The agency's mismanagement put Ontario behind most jurisdictions in the effort to set up a province-wide network of electronic health records.</p>
<p>Province-wide electronic health records could save $6 billion, but the implementation of that system -- originally planned to be completed by 2015 -- will now be delayed because of the scandal.</p>
<p>That is unfortunate, but the good news is that officials at the Champlain Local Health Integration Network, Eastern Ontario's regional agency in charge of e-health, aren't waiting around for Toronto to get its act together. In Eastern Ontario, a new system that would track every person's history of diagnostic tests, medication use, chronic diseases and other medical details, is expected to be in place beginning in 2010 for patients with chronic diseases.</p>
<p>The benefits of electronic health records were evident during the early days of the H1N1 flu pandemic. While most of the country experienced long lineups, folks in Sault Ste. Marie were simply given an appointment to show up and get jabbed. This was possible because more than 80 per cent of that region's residents get health care from a group that uses electronic records.</p>
<p>Recent revelations about the abuse of prescription drugs also point to the need for electronic health records, which would make it more difficult for addicts and dealers to trick health workers.</p>
<p>Someday the province's health care system will finally enter the digital age, though by then Eastern Ontario may already be half-way there.</p>

<p>Someone could write a book about the psychology of the H1N1 flu. It's fascinating to observe people's attitudes to the pandemic and their reasons for not getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>Personality, prejudices and politics all play a role. Even bravado.</p>
<p>type a: the blame game</p>
<p>The biggest cohort of naysayers are those who say the H1N1 threat has been exaggerated and blame one or more of the following:</p>
<p>The media, for "overhyping" the flu</p>
<p>Government and public health, for using it as an opportunity to justify themselves</p>
<p>The medical establishment, for inflating the risk</p>
<p>Big Pharma, for exploiting an opportunity to boost its bottom line</p>
<p>The idea is that the danger has been blown out of proportion for the benefit of bureaucracy and commerce. But those who espouse that line are confusing cause and effect.</p>
<p>Sure, there's profit to be made from this flu. But that doesn't change the facts about its prevalence, its virulence and the balance of risks and benefits of vaccination.</p>
<p>How people respond tends to be a reflection of their overall attitudes towards authority, government and the media.</p>
<p>type B: dare to compare</p>
<p>Doubters typically weigh in on the debate about the dangers of H1N1 by citing other dangers. Auto accidents, lightning strikes and drowning are most common, although some have also mentioned choking on a piece of steak or getting hit by a golf ball.</p>
<p>What these amateur statisticians don't take into account is the difference between an accident that can't be prevented and a disease that can. Besides, don't sensible people do everything they can to prevent accidents, from wearing seatbelts to seeking safe shelter in a thunderstorm?</p>
<p>type c: tough guys</p>
<p>It's cool to be cynical. And macho to tough it out. This was the attitude in one Brampton office where the only man who confessed to getting vaccinated was teased by his colleagues. Indeed, Dr. Kathleen Dooling, associate medical officer of health at Peel Public Health, says that until very recently, there was "a definite bias toward more women getting vaccinated."</p>
<p>But she says that since the vaccine has been made available to everyone over the age of six months, that trend is diminishing. And anyone who thinks that tough guys don't get vaccinated should remember that pro hockey players jumped the queue to get their shots.</p>

<p>Ontario has launched a $650,000 ad campaign to encourage post-secondary students to roll up their sleeves for the H1N1 flu shot.</p>
<p>Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Arlene King, is encouraging students aged 17 to 24 to "Join the Resistance" against the flu.</p>
<p>King says almost half of those hospitalized in Ontario for swine flu are people under 20. However, historically only about 25 per cent of people aged 17-24 get a seasonal flu shot compared to about 50 per cent of the general population. Yet, she says, college and university students are at a greater risk of transmitting the infection because they live and study in such close proximity to each other.</p>
<p>King says the Ontario government sent an "email blast" this week to 53 student associations targeting 400,000 students, sent posters aimed at students to health units and is posting advertising on websites to drive students to clinics.</p>

<p>It's 8 a.m. on a Saturday and Dianne Henry and Sonja Williams are ordering breakfast at <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> in the <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> on Queen St. in Brampton.</p>
<p>Although a Peel Region clinic for H1N1 vaccinations will soon be open for the day on Indell Lane, less than a couple of kilometres away, neither woman plans to make her way there to get the shot.</p>
<p>"I don't want to be a guinea pig," explains Henry, 47. "It's too new."</p>
<p>Her friend is still debating about getting vaccinated. "I usually get the seasonal flu shot," says Williams, 54, "but I'm not sure about this one."</p>
<p>At a table in the corner, Carina Alunan and her three sons, 16, 13 and 10, are eating breakfast. None of them has been vaccinated against the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"Now that it's for everybody," says Alunan, 44, "we'll probably go over there and get it.</p>
<p>"We'd rather have the shot than get sick."</p>
<p>The three different responses - no, maybe, probably - are typical of local reactions.</p>
<p>Apprehension, uncertainty and the balance between risk and benefit are all part of the pandemic scenario that continues to play out, even after the anxiety spike a few weeks ago when Evan Frustaglio, an otherwise healthy teenager, died.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the Public Health Agency of Canada declared that this second wave of the H1N1 pandemic may have peaked already, but does that mean the end is in sight or is a third wave on its way? With the unpredictable flu, it's anyone's guess.</p>
<p>As it was, flu activity remained higher in November in Canada compared to previous years. Given those facts, the attitude of most people right now might best be described as watchful.</p>
<p>That's also the attitude of scientists keeping a close eye on sporadic reports of isolated swine flu mutations.</p>
<p>"That's not likely to become a problem but that doesn't mean we don't need to be worried about it," says Dr. Allison McGeer, infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>"Influenza is capricious and it'd be very brave to make assumptions about how this is going to behave."</p>
<p>More of a risk than a virulent mutation, says McGeer, are reported pockets of resistance to the potent anti-viral drug, Tamiflu.</p>
<p>Typically, says McGeer, "there's a higher risk of an influenza virus becoming resistant than of developing a virulent mutation."</p>
<p>But, she says, "Though both are unlikely to become a problem, either is possible.</p>
<p>That's why there's so much uncertainty about what comes next.</p>
<p>While many experts are predicting a few months of seasonal flu in the New Year, McGeer, when pressed, says, "My read on it is a different interpretation. Mine is that most likely we will see a later season of influenza, in February and March in Canada, and most of the activity will be pandemic H1N1."</p>
<p>But because there's no certainty about which flu will turn up, says McGeer, "It's in the best interests of the health of the public that we get as many people as possible vaccinated with both vaccines."</p>
<p>She acknowledges that there are physicians advising people that they don't have to worry about seasonal flu.</p>
<p>"I hope they're right," she says, "but I think that counting on it is a mistake."</p>

<p>Re: H1N1</p>
<p>It's distressing to hear that so many people think they should not bother with the H1N1 vaccine because they are healthy at the moment. Don't these people realize the world doesn't revolve around them? There is a small proportion of people who become very ill and some die from H1N1.</p>
<p>The more people in the general population who are infected the more of the susceptible people will become very ill and die. These deaths and serious hospital events are preventable if enough people get vaccinated.</p>

<p>More Winnipeggers lined up to get the H1N1 flu vaccine Saturday, causing hour-long waits at three city clinics.</p>
<p>Last week, health officials announced four city flu clinics with low turnout will shut down this week in St. Boniface, Inkster, Transcona and Point Douglas.</p>

<p>He promised Manitobans a steady hand and that's exactly what they'll get in the coming year.</p>
<p>Don't expected any outrageous policy announcements from Premier Greg Selinger as the NDP government's throne speech is delivered today, kicking off a nine-day legislative session.</p>
<p>Selinger said the focus will be stimulating the economy, a huge challenge as revenue from taxes is expected to be down and Ottawa has already said the province will get less in federal transfer or equalization payments.</p>
<p>The challenge is to do more with less. "The reality is we've made a commitment with the other levels of government to do infrastructure stimulus and we will continue to do that," Selinger said Friday, moments before he headed to Calgary to meet with other premiers and watch Sunday's Grey Cup game.</p>
<p>"We will look at how we balance that over the economic life cycle of the situation we're in. We've got more flexible balanced-budget legislation to address that."</p>
<p>Budgets cover a four-year period and allow for a deficit to be posted in one of those years.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu is another spoiler. There is speculation some projects may be delayed because the cost of fighting the flu will hit at least $100 million in Manitoba. "The simple reality is that challenges like H1N1 were not foreseeable, but they had to be addressed... to protect the public," Selinger said.</p>
<p>Other priorities include public safety, health care and education, but Selinger refused to be specific.</p>
<p>Jared Wesley, professor of political studies at the University of Manitoba, said these budgetary pressures put limits on the Selinger government.</p>
<p>He said Manitobans want to see restraint. "I don't think Manitobans would expect anything other than that."</p>
<p>But it also puts Selinger in a tricky spot. "He walks a fine line projecting stability, but at the same time continuing the need to breath some new life into the government," Wesley said.</p>
<p>The NDP has been in power for 10 years -- the time when ruling governments fall out of favour, Wesley added.</p>
<p>Wesley also said the government has to focus some of its agenda on public safety as it's the top concern in most polls. Fighting crime will also take some wind out of the opposition Progressive Conservatives as they portray themselves as the law-and-order party.</p>
<p>Selinger added his government will use the fiscal stabilization fund to offset declines in revenue. The fund sits at more than $800 million, but a portion of it can only be used to reduce health-care wait times. The province had anticipated dipping into it to the tune of $98 million for 2008-2009, but higher-than-budgeted revenues meant it didn't have to raid the piggy bank.</p>
<p>Now, things are different. "Clearly, it's a resource that will have to be used," Selinger said.</p>
<p>Tory Leader Hugh McFadyen said 2010 will be the NDP's toughest year yet. "Draining the savings account is a short-term strategy," he said.</p>
<p>"What they should be looking at is how are we going to stand on our own two feet."</p>
<p>bruce.owen@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Premier's promises</p>
<p>During the run-up to pick a new premier, Greg Selinger's promises didn't cost much, if any, money, or they were a rehash of spending already announced. Some will be in today's throne speech, Selinger said Friday. Selinger's promises included:</p>
<p>Extending the fitness tax credit now offered to kids, to adults</p>
<p>Boosting low-income housing in Manitoba by building 300 new units per year for the next five years</p>
<p>Fast-tracking income tax refunds on post-secondary tuition fees to students who remain in Manitoba after graduation</p>
<p>Creating a fund to help more small businesses get established in Manitoba</p>
<p>Improving high school graduation rates, encouraging more collaboration between business and post-secondary institutions and expanding the use of co-op education tax credits</p>
<p>Improving training, economic opportunities and services for northern and aboriginal people</p>
<p>Fast-tracking the province's nominee program so immigrants could join their families in Canada in less than six months. Currently, some wait up to a year</p>
<p>Use the floodway gates to reduce riverbank flooding and allow for the walkway at The Forks to be open more often during the summer</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Police whirlybird highlight of throne speech -</b>
</div><div>By Dan Lett   </div>
<div>827 words</div><div>30 November 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>It is quite possible that Premier Greg Selinger's first throne speech could be known as the "whirlybird" speech.</p>
<p>Sources indicate the NDP government will fund part of the cost of a new helicopter for the Winnipeg Police Service. It is certainly not going to be the most important element of today's throne speech -- the first by a premier other than Gary Doer in a decade, delivered amid economic uncertainty -- but it might be the sexiest.</p>
<p>The city and province have negotiated for months for financial aid to purchase the copter, which some have estimated at about $3 million with another $1 million a year to operate. Now, it appears a deal is done to give Winnipeg's finest a leg up -- way, way up -- in their battle with criminals.</p>
<p>In an interview, Selinger would not confirm that the police copter was a done deal. He said the province will have additional money for policing and suggested the city would be allowed to determine how best to spend it.</p>
<p>"I think we'll be able to respond to some of what the city is asking for in terms of policing," is as far as Selinger was prepared to go.</p>
<p>What does the helicopter say about Selinger and the viability of his government? It is not a bad sign that Manitoba has money for a big-ticket item that could be viewed as a luxury. At a time when most provinces are concentrating on saving their cake, the helicopter looks a lot like icing. But it's oddly comforting to live in a province where there is still money for icing.</p>
<p>Of course, police helicopters do not do much to reduce or prevent crime. They can certainly help police catch criminals in a more efficient manner once a crime has taken place.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was a time when Selinger, an economist with a background in social services, would have guffawed about buying a helicopter at a time when Manitoba food banks are under siege. The throne speech will no doubt include measures to deal with poverty and economic dysfunction. But, the helicopter commitment shows Selinger probably absorbed more than a little of the political pragmatism that flowed from his predecessor.</p>
<p>That will please some core NDP supporters, and disappoint others who hoped that Selinger would represent a more traditional NDP agenda.</p>
<p>The fact remains that in this economic environment, there isn't a whole lot Selinger can do to tackle systemic issues. He's overseeing an economy that may or may not finish the year in recession. Next year, there will most definitely be a major decrease in federal transfer payments.</p>
<p>And yet, it looks like he found money for a helicopter. That may appear foolish at first blush, but in his decade as finance minister, Selinger never gave the impression he was a whistle-by-the-graveyard kind of guy.</p>
<p>The throne speech will primarily serve as an economic update. On the negative side of the equation, along with slowing growth and evaporating transfer payments, Manitoba has spent tens of millions of dollars this year that were not included in the spring budget.</p>
<p>At the top of that list are the costs of battling the H1N1 flu. The province has estimated total costs this year in excess of $105 million. "That was all unbudgeted," Selinger said.</p>
<p>The bottom line? "Look, we're doing better than most other provinces but doing better could still mean zero (economic growth)," he added.</p>
<p>The economic uncertainty will no doubt lead to some speculation that Selinger may consider calling an election sooner than the October 2011 date required under Manitoba's fixed-election legislation.</p>
<p>During the recent NDP leadership contest, all the candidates said they would not call a snap election. However, many -- including Manitoba Progressive Conservatives -- believe Selinger will go to the polls early, especially if next spring's budget looks promising.</p>
<p>In large part, it is that concern that prompted the Tories to hold a campaign-style announcement last week promising funding for insulin pumps for juvenile diabetes sufferers. Opposition parties would not normally make pledges in between elections, fearful they would be gobbled up by the government in power. They know that by election day, no one remembers if you were the first to make a promise.</p>
<p>On election timing, Selinger is less definitive now than he was during the leadership campaign. "I have no plans to go to the people in the spring... but, one thing I've learned in this business is that you can never say never."</p>
<p>So, Selinger's first throne speech could be his last before the next election or, if a spring election doesn't go his way, his only throne speech.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, Selinger will always have the police helicopter on his record. No one will ever be able to take that away from him.</p>

<p>Canadians shouldn't give up prematurely on the H1N1 vaccine. The flu is still a deadly enemy, and deadly enemies need to be respected. The number of hospitalizations and deaths is still increasing. Public-health authorities need to try harder to get that message across. The game is not over.</p>
<p>For most people, H1N1 is a relatively mild disease, in the sense that they may feel merely rotten for a week. But some previously healthy people find themselves overcome, some of them by an overreaction of their immune systems. The lungs of the dead do not make for a pretty picture in autopsies. They may look more like a liver.</p>
<p>The authorities need to step up. It was they, after all, whose bungling of the “largest-ever immunization campaign” discouraged people. Canadians stormed the first clinics in such numbers many of them had to be shut down. The authorities professed to have been taken by surprise. What, the public actually believed us when we declared an emergency?</p>
<p>This had a number of predictable consequences. People doubted the importance of getting their shots, since the authorities couldn't seem to be bothered to rise to the challenge they had set themselves. Because so many people did not get inoculated as the disease peaked, large numbers contracted H1N1. Most survived, and others took comfort. It's just a flu like any other, some concluded, wrongly.</p>
<p>Then there was the country's inability to grasp, with few exceptions among the provinces, that children, all children and not just those under five, were vulnerable and deserved to be protected. (Saskatchewan and New Brunswick should forever be known as children's havens for allowing all children to receive inoculations.) Instead, children were left without access to the vaccine, and on the front lines. The disease has already been left to roam through the schools. Parents may feel that, if their children have not contracted the flu by now, they're safe.</p>
<p>More than 300 Canadians have died of swine flu since last spring, including 30 between Wednesday and Friday morning. It killed more people from Nov. 16 to 23 than it did all last spring. No one knows where it is going, or if it will return in a more deadly third wave. Yet the public has lost its sense of urgency about being inoculated. The biggest-ever immunization campaign is turning out not to be nearly as big as it could, or should, be.</p>

<p>VANCOUVER -- YOUR SIX-YEAR-OLD HAS A MELTDOWN AT THE RESTAURANT. DO YOU: A) WOLF DOWN YOUR MEAL SO YOU CAN GET HER OUT OF THERE QUICK B) GRAB HER BY THE ARM AND THREATEN TO TAKE HER TOYS AWAY WHEN YOU GET HOME C) TALK TO HER ABOUT TABLE MANNERS, AND IF SHE WON'T SETTLE DOWN, HAVE SOMEONE WAIT WITH HER OUTSIDE THE ANSWER MAY BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ENTITLEMENT, REBELLION AND SELF-CONTROL</p>
<p>Okay, parents, here's a pop quiz. Say you're at the sandbox and your two-year-old bops another toddler on the head. You tell him not to. He does it again.</p>
<p>Do you a) apologize to the kid's mom and explain that your son is teething/overstimulated/going through a tough developmental stage, then offer your little guy a snack to calm him down?</p>
<p>Or b) pull your son from the play area and tell him that if he hits again, he will be strapped into his stroller and taken home?</p>
<p>If you answered (a), your parenting style follows the prevailing trend of the past couple decades.</p>
<p>If you chose (b), however, you may be part of a backlash against what some experts call indulgent childrearing.</p>
<p>Soft parenting has created a generation of spoiled brats, according to Maggie Mamen, author of The Pampered Child Syndrome: How to Recognize It, How to Manage It, and How to Avoid It.</p>
<p>Holy terrors and their lax parents are disturbing the peace in airports and restaurants, grocery stores and schools, she says.</p>
<p>The Ottawa-based psychologist treats children diagnosed with depression, anxiety, attention-deficit disorder and behavioural problems. In many cases, Dr. Mamen says, her patients are not suffering from actual mental disorders – they're showing the effects of spineless parenting.</p>
<p>“There are parents who will not say no to their child because they truly believe this is bad for their child to hear.”</p>
<p>Marshmallow parents produce amoral children, according to American psychiatrist Robert Shaw, author of The Epidemic: The Rot of American Culture, Absentee and Permissive Parenting, and the Resultant Plague of Joyless, Selfish Children. In the book, Dr. Shaw attributes even the 1999 Columbine High School massacre to permissive parenting. Compared to the plague of insolent, narcissistic children he describes, swine flu looks like the common cold.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are signs that “no-nonsense” discipline strategies are being revived.</p>
<p>Parents are tuning in to reality shows such as Nanny 911 to see modern-day governesses whip unruly broods into shape. Others are searching for tips in books such as The Rules of Parenting by Richard Templar and Loving Without Spoiling: And 100 Other Timeless Tips for Raising Terrific Kids by Nancy Samalin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, media outlets are publishing headline-grabbing research on the benefits of tough love.</p>
<p>Children raised with a balance of warmth and discipline are more likely to be empathetic and able to regulate their emotions and complete tasks, according to a recent survey of 9,000 families in Britain.</p>
<p>Researchers from Boston University have found that kids who receive both love and clear limits from their parents are less likely to be overweight when they start school than those with permissive or domineering parents.</p>
<p>And data from a 20-year study of Minnesotan twins suggest that even if children of firm yet loving parents break the rules, they are more likely to assume leadership positions later in life than those raised with other parenting styles.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, advocates of a more democratic approach say that children learn interdependence by having a say in family life. The need for rigid rules may disappear when troubling behaviour is seen as a problem to be solved together, rather than as an infraction that must be punished, says Alfie Kohn, author of Beyond Discipline: From Compliance to Community.</p>
<p>“Your child needs a human being – flawed, caring and vulnerable – more than he or she needs someone pretending to be a crisply competent Perfect Parent,” he writes.</p>
<p>But Dr. Mamen insists that children need to know who's boss.</p>
<p>As their offices fill up with sullen, self-entitled youth, she and other child psychologists are calling for a return to the parenting model championed by Diana Baumrind in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Dr. Baumrind came up with the notion of three parenting styles: authoritarian (too hard), permissive (too soft) and authoritative (just right).</p>
<p>Older parents may recognize them as the brick-wall, jellyfish and backbone parents popularized by Barbara Coloroso in her bestselling book Kids Are Worth It.</p>
<p>While the model is hardly new, parenting with a firm grip fell out of favour in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>In many households, the values rooted in the United Nations 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child were taken too far, Dr. Mamen says.</p>
<p>Reluctant to deny their children anything, parents cave in to demands for cellphones, flexible curfews and freedom from surveillance. “What used to be privileges have now become rights.”</p>
<p>The California-based self-esteem movement was another blow to authoritative parenting, says Steven Hughes, a pediatric neuropsychologist at the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>When pundits blamed low self-esteem for everything from alcoholism to teenage pregnancy, parents and teachers went overboard to praise kids, regardless of their talents or efforts. Parents then set out to convince the world that their child was exceptional.</p>
<p>“What we have is at least a generation of parents who are absolutely unmoored from their instincts,” says Dr. Hughes, who gives talks on the subject throughout North America.</p>
<p>Not all parents have become human jellyfish, though.</p>
<p>Deanna Dahlsad, a mother of three in Fargo, N.D., says she frowns on parents who “prize their children kind of like begonias or pets.”</p>
<p>Her own parents had firm boundaries and presented a united front, an approach she takes with her own children, says Ms. Dahlsad, who writes for online publications.</p>
<p>In a post titled “Permissive Parents, Stop Ruining Your Children,” Ms. Dahlsad blogged about “lazy parents” who defend their kids' right to run amok in shopping centres or rummage through doctors' offices.</p>
<p>“I was kind of surprised my post didn't get more hate mail,” she says.</p>
<p>Building self-esteem doesn't mean ensuring a child is happy all the time, or free to do as he or she pleases, Dr. Mamen says.</p>
<p>Parents need to set limits with their children and let them discover they are capable of solving problems even when they don't get what they want.</p>
<p>“We are a hierarchical species,” she says. “It's our job</p>
<p>as the adults to guide children and essentially train them to be self-sufficient adults who can form good relationships.”</p>
<p>Mothers and fathers of children with behavioural problems are relieved when she urges them to stand up to their kids, she adds: It's never too late to grow a backbone.</p>

</div><div>Cory Wolfe   </div>

<div>702 words</div><div>30 November 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>Nearly 30 minutes after Saturday's game, Derek Hulak waited impatiently to do a radio interview outside of the Saskatoon Blades' dressing room.</p>
<p>The captain was still steaming over a 5-4 loss to the Calgary Hitmen.</p>
<p>He stood with his arms crossed, his brow furrowed and a frown flooding across his face. Most of Hulak's teammates wore similar expressions.</p>
<p>"They're disappointed," said Blades coach-GM Lorne Molleken, whose team suffered its first regulation loss in more than a month. "They know how big that hockey game was. Sometimes you just come out flat and it's something else we need to learn from and put behind us because we have another big game coming up Wednesday (in Brandon)."</p>
<p>The WHL-leading Blades fell behind 5-1 Saturday and were outshot 26-11 through two periods. They nearly treated an announced crowd of 4,332 to an improbable comeback with three goals in the final eight minutes. But for most of the night, the hosts were severely outclassed by the team that's chasing them for top spot in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>"We're frustrated that we didn't come out hard at all in the first 40, 45 minutes," said winger Burke Gallimore, who scored the first of three late goals for Saskatoon. "But coming back like we did shows how much character our room has and that we're never out of a game.</p>
<p>"We have some negatives to learn from, but we take some positives, too, because we never quit on ourselves."</p>
<p>Calgary ended Saskatoon's 10-game home winning streak and also dealt goaltender Steven Stanford his first loss in 11 appearances as a Blade. Linemates Joel Broda and Brandon Kozun did most of the damage. Broda, a Prince Albert product, scored twice including a short-handed marker, while Kozun netted two even-strength goals and added two assists. Ian Schultz also tallied.</p>
<p>Saskatoon got goals from Charles Inglis -- who wore 25-plus stitches after being high-sticked in the face Friday versus Lethbridge -- as well as Gallimore, Hulak and Travis Toomey.</p>
<p>Prior to Saturday, the Blades hadn't lost in regulation since Oct. 23 in Swift Current.</p>
<p>"The fact that we were able to go on the run that we did, we take a lot of pride in that," said Toomey, who cut Calgary's lead to 5-4 with 23.5 seconds left in regulation. "Nobody is going to win every game in a season, but we're always going to come out and expect to win."</p>
<p>The Blades (20-4-0-3) lead the WHL's overall standings, but the Hitmen (20-8-1-0) are now within two points. Saskatoon has two games in hand.</p>
<p>"We have the talent, the grit and all of components to be a championship team this year," said Gallimore, "but when we have little lapses like this, it hurts. We have to learn from it."</p>
<p>Stanford finished with 25 saves, while Martin Jones blocked 18 shots for Calgary.</p>
<p>The Blades return to practice today to prepare for a busy week on the road. After Wednesday's game in Brandon, they have dates Friday in Medicine Hat and Saturday in Red Deer.</p>
<p>BLADE BITS: Stanford made back-to-back starts Friday and Saturday because his tandem-mate, Adam Morrison, was feeling ill after receiving an H1N1 shot earlier in the week. . . . Blades D Dalton Thrower returned to the Blades' lineup after being sidelined with bronchitis for three games. . . . Guy Charron is 0-1-0-1 since taking over as head coach of the Kamloops Blazers. Assistant Scott Ferguson posted a 3-6-0-1 record as interim coach after Barry Smith was fired following a 4-1 loss Oct. 24 in Saskatoon.</p>

<p>The SP's three stars</p>
<p>1. Hitmen RW Brandon Kozun -- Tiny talent bagged four points.</p>
<p>2. Hitmen C Joel Broda -- Two goals, including short-handed tally.</p>
<p>3. Blades LW Derek Hulak -- Led late charge with three points.</p>

<p>The Windsor Regiment Band played Christmas music Saturday to put blood donors in the mood for giving.</p>
<p>The band helped the Windsor Blood Donor Clinic at 3909 Grand Marais Rd. E. kick off a holiday blood donation campaign that runs until after Christmas.</p>
<p>"The need for blood never takes a holiday," said Joan Hannah, community development co-ordinator for the Canadian Blood Services in Windsor.</p>
<p>Tuba player and retired Sgt. Arnold Eagle didn't have to roll up his sleeve before he started playing Saturday. He gave blood just over a week ago, for the 147th time.</p>
<p>Many in the band are regular blood donors.</p>
<p>Windsor Regiment Band director of music and Capt. Beth Dykeman said this is the third year the band has played Christmas music for the clinic. "There's so much need for it right now," she said of blood donations after putting down her French horn.</p>
<p>Inside the clinic, Alexs Navarro, 28, was waiting to be screened to give blood. She and her boyfriend regularly travel from Leamington to give blood.</p>
<p>She wasn't expecting Christmas music.</p>
<p>"They're really good," she said of the band.</p>
<p>The Canadian Blood Services put out the call for more blood donations last week.</p>
<p>To get ready for winter and the flu seasons, the Canadian Blood Services wants to build up a seven-day inventory of blood. Donated blood is usually used within five days.</p>
<p>That way if a lot of people are sick with the seasonal flu or the H1N1 virus, or bad weather hits, the Canadian Blood Services will have some blood stockpiled.</p>
<p>People are asked to come and donate during the holidays.</p>
<p>Hannah said you cannot get the flu, seasonal or the H1N1 virus, by giving or receiving blood. If you just got your flu shot, you can give blood two days after receiving the vaccine.</p>
<p>The Windsor Blood Donor Clinic is open Mondays and Thursdays from noon until 7 p.m. and Tuesdays and Fridays from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>
<p>The Wednesday hours are 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. On Saturdays the hours are from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>
<p>Anyone with questions can call 1-888-2 DONATE or 1-888-236-6283.</p>

</p>
<p>Amid concerns that Quebecers are losing interest in getting the H1N1 vaccine, vaccination centres in Montreal operated yesterday at well below capacity.</p>
<p>Officials were watching turnout very closely, because yesterday was the first weekend day in Montreal for which there were no restrictions at all on who could get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Although restrictions were lifted in Montreal last Wednesday, that was a work day. But even with most people not working yesterday, vaccination centres in Montreal still weren't as busy as authorities had hoped they would be.</p>
<p>At a morning news conference in Quebec City, Health Minister Yves Bolduc had urged people to get out and get the vaccine, highlighting medical consensus in favour of vaccination.</p>
<p>Bolduc and other officials at the news conference called on Quebecers to give themselves the vaccine as a Christmas present - "Give yourself the gift of health" was their sound bite for the day.</p>
<p>At vaccination centres in the former Allancroft School in Beaconsfield and Cavendish Mall in Côte St. Luc yesterday, there were no long lines or mad rush for the vaccine, or for appointment coupons. People were generally in and out within 45 minutes.</p>
<p>At Allancroft, some people were able to walk in without appointment coupons late yesterday morning and get vaccines with no waiting.</p>
<p>Bolduc said at his morning news conference that 33 per cent of Quebecers had received the vaccine by Friday night. Restrictions on who can receive the vaccine will have been lifted in all regions of Quebec by tomorrow.</p>
<p>"I had no hesitation about getting the vaccine," said Radu Vintila of Île Bizard, who visited the Allancroft facility just before noon. "I have a scientific background and I believe in medicine."</p>
<p>Victoria de Takacsy's two children already had been vaccinated, but they accompanied her to Allancroft for her shot. "It took no time at all, I had my coupon, it was 30 minutes," said de Takacsy.</p>
<p>At Cavendish Mall, the long snaking lines that had marked the early days of the vaccination effort were a mere memory yesterday.</p>
<p>Kitty Cohen of Snowdon came with a friend to help her with her walker and was in and out in 45 minutes. "It was very well done, very organized."</p>
<p>Marcel Allaire was sitting at a table handing out coupons with numbers on them, like the coupons people take when they wait in line at busy pastry shops.</p>
<p>"It take 45 minutes to an hour," he told people who inquired about the length of the wait.</p>
<p>The Cavendish Mall clinic can handle 250 people an hour, but it was nowhere near that busy yesterday, Allaire said. "It's not as busy as expected, but there's no downtime and no lines."</p>
<p>Volunteer Gerri Barrer noted that yesterday afternoon was the quietest she had seen the clinic since it opened.</p>
<p>Bolduc said during his news conference that there have been 61 deaths in Quebec from H1N1 since the second wave of the swine flu started sweeping Quebec in late August.</p>
<p>asutherland@thegazette.canwest.com</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>One third of us vaccinated</p>
<p>As of yesterday, 33 per cent of Quebecers had received the H1N1 vaccine. The goal is to vaccinate 75 per cent by Christmas, the Health Department says, given that polls show 25 per cent of the population say they don't want the vaccine. Authorities are urging everyone to be inoculated.</p>
<p>Number of of Quebec deaths since second wave of H1N1 started sweeping through the province in late August: 61.</p>
<p>Number of hospitalizations for H1N1 as of early Saturday: 764.</p>
<p>Number of people in intensive care early Saturday: 130.</p>
<p>Number of people on respirators early Saturday: 85.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Jesse Deer brought his struggles into the open; 'He was so young but he was such an old soul'</b>
</div><div>BRENDA BRANSWELL   </div>
<div>The gazette</div>
<div>635 words</div><div>29 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>In his short life, Jesse Deer worked as a radio co-host and a television reporter.</p>
<p>He also wrote a newspaper column in which he talked about his struggles with his weight and diabetes.</p>
<p>"He wanted to get his hand in everything because he was just so fascinated with media," said Steve Bonspiel, the editor and publisher of the Eastern Door.</p>
<p>Deer was also active in a community project that is looking at the future of Kahnawake, the Mohawk territory just south of Montreal.</p>
<p>He was just shy of his 24th birthday when he died last Tuesday after contracting the H1N1 virus. He had been in hospital for several weeks.</p>
<p>A funeral service was held yesterday in Kahnawake.</p>
<p>The five media outlets in Kahnawake already have moved to create a scholarship in Deer's name. It will go to a student who is pursuing journalism or media studies in post-secondary education and excelling in it, Bonspiel said.</p>
<p>"We've each pledged $500 so we have $2,500 pledged towards it. And we're looking for donations from anybody who is willing to help out.</p>
<p>"People loved Jesse," Bonspiel said.</p>
<p>"He was so young but he was such an old soul. When you talked to him you didn't feel like you were talking to a 23-year-old." Deer suffered a terrible accident last year while working for KTV - the Mohawk Council's media channel. He slid down a pole at a fire hall for a skit and broke both his legs, Bonspiel said.</p>
<p>He was in the hospital for months, Bonspiel said. The community rallied around him, raising enough money to buy Deer a special bed and a specially adapted bike.</p>
<p>"Despite all his struggles, he somehow just kept on smiling and making people laugh." Deer never complained, said Joe Delaronde, the chairperson of the board at K103 Radio, a community-owned and operated station.</p>
<p>He was a Jack of all trades at the radio station and also did colour commentary for the station's broadcasts of hockey games involving Kahnawake's Junior Triple AAA team.</p>
<p>"He did everything," said Delaronde.</p>
<p>Deer contracted the flu before the H1N1 vaccine was offered in Kahnawake starting the first week of November, said Kellyann Meloche, the community's emergency planning manager.</p>
<p>Meloche said nearly 4,100 residents, about half of the territory's population, have received the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>She said she wished the rate was higher. The vaccine continues to be offered at the Kateri Memorial Hospital Centre, Meloche said.</p>
<p>A doctor at the hospital told The Gazette last summer that Kahnawake has a higher proportion of chronic illness such as diabetes and asthma than the provincial average, and, as a result, its population is more at risk for the spread of H1N1 infection.</p>
<p>Other aboriginal communities in Canada have similar high risks.</p>
<p>Deer was the youth representative on "the Visioning Project" committee, which has been sounding out people in Kahnawake about where they see the community heading in 20 years.</p>
<p>Delaronde, who is also a press attaché for the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake, said he was told that Deer wrote such a heartfelt letter that he was selected for the committee.</p>
<p>In the newspaper column he once wrote, Deer talked about the difficulty of being "a big guy," Delaronde said. "Because he was so honest he touched so many people." "He was a beautiful person." bbranswell@ thegazette.canwest.com For information about the memorial scholarship fund, visit www.easterndoor.com/feature/[http://www.easterndoor.com.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/feature/] jesse-deer-memorial-media-scholarship-works</p>

<p>Starting Monday, Albertans will again be able to get their regular seasonal flu vaccinations at clinics around the province.</p>
<p>The mass vaccination clinics that have been providing H1N1 protection will also offer seasonal influenza shots starting tomorrow morning, Alberta Health Services said in a news release Saturday.</p>
<p>Seven locations in the Edmonton area will be open until the end of December and will immunize all Albertans over the age of six months. Valid identification and an Alberta Health Card are required.</p>
<p>There are five clinics in Edmonton, at Commonwealth Stadium, Millbourne Mall, Northgate Centre, Rutherford Health Centre and Westmount Centre. Other area clinics are at Grandin Park Plaza in St. Albert and the Strathcona County Health Centre in Sherwood Park.</p>
<p>The clinics will be open from 9 a.m. until 8 p.m. Monday to Thursday, and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. The clinics at Commonwealth Stadium, Millbourne Mall and Westmount Centre will be open Sundays as well, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services said it will work to keep wait times short so people don't have to line up before clinics open.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Humour eases Mandel's OCD</b>
</div><div>Mary Brophy Marcus   </div>
<div>USA Today</div>
<div>721 words</div><div>29 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>D8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Though he has gone public about his lifelong struggle with obsessive-compulsive disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Howie Mandel fills in more details in his new book, Here's the Deal: Don't Touch Me. USA Today talked with the comedian and host of Deal or No Deal.</p>
<p>Q: Why a book, why now?</p>
<p>a: At this point in my life I have more notoriety than I've ever had. I was thinking I had funny, entertaining stories to tell. But I sat down to write and I thought I'd just be honest. It was a surprise to me.</p>
<p>Q: How long have you had OCD and ADHD?</p>
<p>a: I've been dealing with issues my entire life, and I feel like I'm very lucky and blessed in my life and career. But at the same time, I'm constantly tortured with my issues.</p>
<p>Q: In your book, you say any public restroom freaks you out because of the germ factor. You write about not being able to take your daughter into one when she was a toddler. What are some of your other issues?</p>
<p>a: The difference between you and me is that even when I wash my hands, I can't get it out of my mind that they're not clean. I have to go back to the sink, I can't even continue with my day. I have to leave the party, leave work. Those thoughts are so intrusive and on a continual loop that I can't inhibit it. Everybody has irregular thoughts, but not like this.</p>
<p>Q: In the book, you write a lot about your family and their love and support. How has your marriage survived your ordeal?</p>
<p>a: I do 250 live dates a year. I'm a hard guy to be with, so it's probably good I travel so much. We've been married 30 years and together 36, but my wife says that with me on the road, it adds up to maybe three.</p>
<p>Q: Do you worry that your children have been affected by your disorders?</p>
<p>a: My wife (Terry) and kids (Jackie, 25, Alex, 20, and Riley, 17) have had to cope throughout the years with my idiosyncrasies. It's a tightrope. All of us have gone through therapy. I don't think there's anyone alive that doesn't need coping skills when you're married. They have always loved and supported me. But even with all that support and love it's still incredibly hard, sometimes terrifying and dark.</p>
<p>Q: How long have you been in therapy, and what medicines or coping strategies do you rely on?</p>
<p>a: Major therapy for at least a decade. I've done everything from specific kinds of therapy to medications. There's tons of help and alternatives.</p>
<p>Q: How have people reacted to you since you revealed your struggles?</p>
<p>a: At the beginning, before I exposed it, if I didn't shake some-one's hand, people would take it very personally and say, "What, you think I'm dirty, you think you're too famous?" Now, it's like people will extend their hand to shake and then they remember and they do a fist bump instead. And they apologize. But nobody has to apologize. You don't have to live in my world, I have to live in yours.</p>
<p>Q: Do you ever have days you don't think about your OCD?</p>
<p>a: I can't get through a day without an OCD thought. I wish I could. People always come up and say, "I have a little bit of that OCD." You can't have a little bit. It's an obsessive thought. You can't get it out of your mind. Like with washing my hands.</p>
<p>Q: With your concerns about germs, how do you feel about the book release and signings?</p>
<p>a: I'm scared to death of Nov. 24. I'm probably the only guy set up for these book signings hoping no one will show up. I don't want to face anyone, look anyone in the eye. Who, with my condition, would do a book tour right in the middle of H1N1 flu season?</p>

<p>Re: "Swann crosses the line," Editorial, Nov. 26.</p>
<p>Your editorial states: "It's the virus that caused the deaths of 51 Albertans. To suggest the government is directly responsible because of its lack of action or incompetence is ludicrous." This is typical arrant anti-Liberal sophistry. At least, Dr. David Swann and his credentials are recognized. We are told very little of what Swann said about the government's handling (or mishandling) of the H1N1 pandemic or in what context. The only quote included: "Those people who were supposed to be vaccinated, how many of them have died or are in hospital today because they failed to get the vaccine?" is not an absurd question. In fact, it is an obvious question in the interests of settling accountability, something sadly and too long lacking in Alberta politics..</p>

<p>Re: "Four new H1N1 deaths raise Alberta toll to 51," Nov. 25.</p>
<p>Now that the H1N1 flu panic seems to be winding down in Alberta, I wonder what new, terrifying killer the World Health Organization will come up with. The unnecessary panic WHO has caused and some of the ridiculous statements made by Alberta politicians and health-care officials are a disgrace. The doom these groups told us would be visited upon us has not arrived. We were told of packed hospitals, not enough room to store the dead, up to 30 per cent of the population becoming sick, the economy seriously affected, etc. What really occurred was a flu outbreak on par with the regular yearly influenza statistics.</p>
<p>I agree that one death is too many, and we must always be aware of potential threats to people's health, but the six-hour lineups at flu clinics are evidence of the panic caused by the outrageous statements made. Now we are told to expect a third and fourth wave of swine flu. Let's hope the experts have learned their lesson before telling us to expect the four horsemen of the apocalypse.</p>

</p>
<p>I'm in a public washroom at the mall, trying to use the facilities without touching anything, when I realize I'm becoming my mother.</p>
<p>Mum was the queen of germaphobes. I've seen her balance on one foot in stilettos on a moving train to flush the toilet with the other foot. She perfected the art of hovering over the toilet seat, and when my sisters and I failed to achieve this, she papered the seat with toilet tissue so our tiny tushes wouldn't come in contact.</p>
<p>To avoid public bathrooms altogether, she developed a camel-like ability to go hours without drinking or peeing, while we girls would toddle along with parched throats and bursting bladders.</p>
<p>Mum wore gloves and travelled with Dettol antiseptic in her purse until the early days of hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>Much as we hated all this, we had to admit you can't argue with success. Mum was astonishingly healthy until her death last year at 95. She passed away a year too soon: she would have loved the H1N1 crisis. Today, the whole world is following her lead, and it's not an easy task. Danger lurks in every doorknob, elevator button and faucet. Since most of us don't want to become like Howard Hughes, living in one small room to avoid germs, we're looking for help.</p>
<p>So here's the latest technology has to offer. Consider it as your H1N1 Christmas shopping list.</p>
<p>First, there's the H1N1 Destroying UV Wand that can be waved over kitchen counters, keyboards, cellphones, bedding or presumably house guests to destroy -- it says -- 99.8 per cent of H1N1 viruses after a five-second exposure. At two feet long, it makes you resemble a Jedi warrior, but it's a bargain at $70 U.S.</p>
<p>The Pocket-Sized Germ Eliminating Light is much handier, but you have to hold it three inches above any offending surface for 20 seconds, so it may be a little less convenient but still a steal at $70 U.S.</p>
<p>Serious flu fighters will pay $240 U.S. for the Mould and Germ Destroying Air Purifier. Continuing with the Star Wars theme, this device looks like R2D2 without the charming personality, and it claims to destroy all viruses, mould, bacteria, dust mites and pollen in a large room. A night-light is built in.</p>
<p>Your household will also need the Touchless Paper Towel Dispenser ($80 U.S.) and the iTouchless stainless steel garbage can ($59 U.S.). The towel dispenser "advances the roll until its optical scanner recognizes the sheet perforations" then stops so you can tear it off with one hand. The garbage can will open when it detects something six inches away from its infrared sensor.</p>
<p>In honour of mum, I can't leave out the Automatic Deodorizing Antimicrobial Toilet Seat ($130 U.S.) that starts a fan as soon as you sit down, wafting out jasmine/lavender or citrus/eucalyptus scents to freshen the "ambient air." And while we're in the bathroom, there's the Million Germ Eliminating Travel Toothbrush Sanitizer to de-virus your toothbrush in seven minutes for only $30 U.S..</p>
<p>The home office is not forgotten with the Unotron SpillSeal Keyboard ($46 U.S.) with built-in anti-bacterial silver-based biocide. It can be safely sprayed with hospital grade disinfectants, and comes with matching anti-bacterial mouse.</p>
<p>Santa has to load up on the Christmas stocking-stuffer that will be on everyone's wish list: the handler. It's a little device that attaches to your key chain and allows you to pop out a hook-shaped thing that will grab faucets or handles on toilets and doors or punch elevator buttons or ATM machines. The whole thing is coated with nanoparticles of silver, which is supposed to do something good. It comes in cute colours, and at $11 U.S., it's a great present for everyone from your kid's teacher to the Purell-pusher in the next cubicle.</p>
<p>What would Christmas be without toys? <span class="companylink">Fisher-Price</span> has come up with the perfect doll for today's flu obsessed child: Baby Achoo ($50 U.S.) sneezes, coughs and tells you her nose is stuffy and she needs a tissue. She comes with her own box of tissues, thermometer, bottle of medicine and "interactive" medicine spoon. When you feed her the medicine, she then says she feels better and wants to play. She has not yet learned to say, "How long is the line-up at the flu clinic?"</p>
<p>Most of the electronic gadgets are available through hammacher.com or amazon.com. Dolls are at Toys 'R Us stores, and the handler can be purchased through handlerusa.com.</p>
<p>Happy H1N1 holiday shopping.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Winter warmth; Isabelle Boulay comforts us even as she dances in a snowstorm</b>
</div><div>The Gazette</div>
<div>1192 words</div><div>29 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A16 / BREAK</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Wearing a knee-length shawl that envelopes her petite body, her mane of auburn hair flowing with every gesture, Isabelle Boulay looks as warm as could be on a chilly late-autumn day in a Vieux-Montréal auberge, as warm as her new album, Chansons pour les mois</p>
<p>d'hiver (released last week by Audiogram). While it's an immensely comforting album to take us through the long winter months, it is also, in an unpretentious way, considerably deeper than that.</p>
<p>With an easy smile and a self-deprecating laugh, the daughter of smalltown Gaspé restaurateurs - who now lives in working-class Point St. Charles - is not one to go through the motions. Which is perhaps why Boulay is the one so-called middle-of-the-road superstar from Quebec who attracts hosannas from so-called highbrow critics. In a word, she's got soul; you get the impression she means every word she sings - and says.</p>
<p>If the album, her ninth since 1996, is "more confidential" than the others, she says, it's because winter is "our signature, our essence, which makes us different from other people. It's a season in which nature proves it's larger than us and makes us feel very small. Thus I wanted to make a comforting album, sort of like (an album) of lullabies for adults. I think people need reassurance, not only because winter can be difficult, but because of the economic crisis, the (H1N1) pandemic, natural disasters, so many things that shake us up. I sense people need to return to simpler things, to calm down - like a clothes dryer on the delicate cycle!"</p>
<p>In fact, the album amounts to a perfectly programmed song cycle, with compositions by an eclectic array of writers including Michel Rivard, Jean-Pierre Ferland, Françoise Hardy, Carla Bruni, Leonard Cohen, Julien Clerc and Francis Cabrel.</p>
<p>She even sings that old chestnut Tennessee Waltz. This last song dates from 1947, and the most recent one on the album is from 2007. "I like the fact that these songs span 60 years," she says. The eclecticism is a throwback to her early youth, when her mother would play records by everyone from Edith Piaf to Québécois country singers. It's why she counts alt-country figures Lucinda Williams and Ron Sexmith among her favourite singer-songwriters, alongside French nouvelle-chanson star Benjamin Biolay. </p>
<p>The warmth of Chansons pour les mois d'hiver is due in no small measure to the way it was recorded. "We did the album in the round, like a sacred circle of musicians," says Boulay. "The ambience was familial, and we encouraged each other, as if all</p>
<p>our little hearts were mixed together and everybody brought their own light."</p>
<p>Winter, of course, practically defines Quebec; the album's booklet is prefaced by the quintessential Gilles Vigneault line, "Mon pays c'est l'hiver."</p>
<p>"I love walking through a snowstorm not only because it reminds me of my childhood, but it's also sort of like a dance of resistance with nature, that makes me feel all the stronger for it. And when the summer heat finally arrives, we're so extremely happy because we've braved winter. But I still know that the elements are much stronger than I am."</p>
<p>Winter doesn't mean the same thing in France as it does here. Thus the album will not be officially launched with a big promotion over there, where Boulay is a huge star, having achieved her first major exposure in the 1990s playing in the rock-opera Starmania and winning awards as best singer early in this decade. But it will be available "because my hard-core fans will want it. Perhaps when I do my next (European) tour, I'll include a few songs from it, like I did with my country album (De retour à la source, from 2007). The French public seems to like that, although the record company is perhaps a little more worried (that it won't fly). That's something I can understand."</p>
<p>When I ask her how she maintains her own values in the hyped-up world of show business, Boulay's answer is a soliloquy that would not appear out of place in, say, a Michel Tremblay play:</p>
<p>"I live in Point St. Charles. Obviously I live in a nice house, but I've always liked real neighbourhoods. I prefer being of the people rather than being a celebrity. I have friends who are celebrities, but I wouldn't trade places with them because I just don't have what it takes to live well in that life.</p>
<p>"Other stars have extraordinary personalities and they're obliged to live up to that. Yes, the vedette system is a world I inhabit from time to time, but I need to be in this world, not out of it. I can eat at a fancy restaurant in Paris one day and then next day eat at a spot in Place St. Henri and I feel just as well.</p>
<p>"I come from a modest background where much value was accorded to work. And I've been privileged enough to do what I've felt like doing, a freedom that allows me to make this album and my country album. It's a privileged life, to be sure, but perhaps I can make people feel good who maybe aren't so privileged. I have a comfortable life, and, of course, I like nice things, but I need to feel like other people. I never wanted to use my talent just to be a vedette. I try to do my best in an artisanal sense."</p>
<p>Thirteen months ago, a new force entered Boulay's life - a child, Marcus. And perhaps, like Chansons pour les mois d'hiver, the boy puts her life - and career - in perspective.</p>
<p>"I'm very aware that I'm not a conventional mother. I try to be there for him as much as possible, but I know I can't. It's important for me that he feels happy not only in my arms but also in the arms of other people. My parents owned a restaurant and they weren't always with me. Of course, I must always consider my child in the choices I make, but it's not like a prison for me.</p>
<p>"When you have a child you begin to realize that you're not immortal. It's hard to let your child be independent, but it's also a gift that you give him. Certainly having a child takes its toll physically, but mentally I feel much less fatigued than before. It gives me a sense of creativity, but also the sense of living my life doing what I want to do, because it sets an example for my child."</p>

</p>
<p>Anyone on southern Vancouver Island hoping for an H1N1 flu shot will have to wait until later this week. Vaccine supplies for the south Island have run out.</p>
<p>The next vaccine delivery to Vancouver Island is scheduled for Tuesday, meaning the next clinics in Greater Victoria and Duncan will be held Wednesday, Vancouver Island Health Authority spokesman Stephen May said yesterday.</p>
<p>Clinics scheduled yesterday for Westshore Town Centre and Duncan's Island Savings Centre were cancelled. Clinics that were to have been held tomorrow in Duncan, Oak Bay High School and the Latter-Day Saints Church on Mann Avenue have been cancelled, as has Tuesday's scheduled clinic at the Latter-Day Saints Church.</p>
<p>On central and northern Vancouver Island, where there is still an adequate vaccine supply, today's clinic in Parksville is scheduled to go ahead. So did yesterday's clinics in Campbell River, Comox and Nanaimo.</p>
<p>Vancouver Island's vaccine is delivered once a week. Last week, with criteria for the shot expanding to include the general public, demand outstripped supply, May said.</p>
<p>"We have 100,000 doses coming [this] week and that will get shipped out [to the regions], so the clinics for Wednesday are fine," he said.</p>
<p>"This will be the largest amount we have received in one week."</p>
<p>The vaccine is distributed by the federal government to the provinces, and provincial officials then dole it out it to health authorities, May said.</p>
<p>Initially, vaccine supplies were limited because of "production challenges," but the current temporary shortage arose because so many people attended clinics, May said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Alberta readies seasonal flu shots; Two more deaths bring H1N1 pandemic toll to 56</b>
</div><div>Michelle Lang   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald And Canwest News Service</div>
<div>537 words</div><div>28 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Two more Albertans with H1N1 influenza have died, bringing the total number of fatalities related to the new flu strain to 56 in the province, health officials said Friday.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services said the deaths occurred in two women, one from Edmonton and another from the central part of the province.</p>
<p>"Both (victims) had underlying health conditions," said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Alberta Health Services.</p>
<p>While the second wave of the flu pandemic is waning in Alberta and across the country, the virus is still causing serious disease and even deaths.</p>
<p>A total of 1,165 Albertans with swine flu have been hospitalized.</p>
<p>Nationally, more than 300 people with H1N1 have died since the beginning of the outbreak and the Public Health Agency of Canada said Thursday 30 new deaths were reported by the provinces in a span of two days.</p>
<p>On Friday, Alberta Health Services announced it will begin offering seasonal flu vaccines, in addition to H1N1 vaccine, at its mass clinics beginning Monday.</p>
<p>"We're adding in seasonal vaccine, specifically targeted at high-risk individuals," said Dr. Judy MacDonald, the organization's deputy medical officer of health in Calgary, who noted seasonal flu strains may begin appearing soon.</p>
<p>"We have the capacity to introduce seasonal flu vaccine again, so it makes sense to do so now."</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services, which now has H1N1 clinics open to the general public, said all of its Calgary vaccination sites will run this weekend, except for the MacEwan Student Centre clinic, which is closed for Grey Cup.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq received her H1N1 vaccine Friday and urged Canadians to follow her example because the virus is so unpredictable.</p>
<p>"For those individuals in Canada who have not yet received their H1N1 vaccine I would encourage you to go out and get the vaccine," Aglukkaq said afterwards.</p>
<p>She said wary Canadians should not be concerned about the vaccine's safety.</p>
<p>"The scientific community has assured us that it is safe for Canadians," she said. "It's one thing I can do to protect myself and my family."</p>
<p>Aglukkaq added that she has given the vaccine to her young son.</p>
<p>Political leaders such as Aglukkaq have had to wait their turn to get their shots and in most jurisdictions, the H1N1 clinics only opened beyond the initial priority groups in the past week or two.</p>
<p>Gary Doer, Canada's ambassador to the United States and the former premier of Manitoba, along with Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty have both received their shots, while other provincial leaders say they will be getting theirs as soon as they can schedule a visit to a clinic.</p>
<p>Public health officials are pushing the message that vaccination is the best defence against H1N1 and that it's not too late to be protected against it.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq and Canadian Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said this week that the level of H1N1 in some communities is stabilizing, but they emphasized that doesn't mean Canadians should feel complacent about the pandemic.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Soaring garlic prices in China reek of flu fears; Pungent bulb used in many traditional medical potions</b>
</div><div>AILEEN MCCABE    </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>522 words</div><div>28 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>As fear of H1N1 flu grows in China, so, too, does the price of garlic.</p>
<p>Pandemic panic is definitely not the only reason garlic prices are soaring in Chinese markets - the fact farmers planted only half as much as last year is the biggest factor - but the idea of mixing the pungent bulb into traditional Chinese medical potions to ward off the flu is helping to deplete stocks in many vegetable stalls.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, garlic is selling at as much as $2 a kilogram, about 50 per cent more than only one month ago.</p>
<p>Garlic has long been considered by many to be a natural enemy of the common cold and some viral infections, but it seems to be attracting more attention as H1N1 spreads.</p>
<p>It is unclear where the latest craze of using garlic to combat H1N1 came from, but it was given a decided boost by a recent China Daily story that is now cited everywhere on the Internet.</p>
<p>The story said: "Teachers of the No. 15 High School in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, have purchased about 200 kilograms of garlic, which students are forced to eat every day for lunch. The school staff believe eating garlic can prevent the H1N1 flu."</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced of the efficacy of a garlic cure, however.</p>
<p>At a Shanghai market, a greengrocer named Ye attests to the rise in price, but says he hasn't seen any increase in demand - just the opposite, in fact.</p>
<p>"The sales used to be better when the price was lower," he said.</p>
<p>Ye added: "I know garlic is good and garlic can kill viruses, but, honestly, I don't think it can prevent H1N1 flu."</p>
<p>Doctors and government officials are trying hard to bring people around to Ye's way of thinking. Yu Jian'er, head of Shanghai's Municipal Hospital of Traditional Medicine, told the Shanghai Morning Post that not only is garlic no substitute for China's national vaccine, it is actually "hot in nature," and should be consumed sparingly.</p>
<p>The truth is, however, that the vaccine is not available to the vast majority in China, even if they all wanted it. China has enough for only seven per cent of its 1.2 billion population, so it is carefully controlling who gets inoculated.</p>
<p>At the moment, about 1.5 million Chinese are vaccinated a day, mostly health and emergency workers, primary and secondary school students and teachers, and pregnant women.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, health officials say, 80 million to 90 million people will be vaccinated.</p>
<p>China has reported 104 swine flu-related deaths, but there are growing indications the number is higher and H1N1-related deaths are being wrongly reported as pneumonia.</p>
<p>There are also fears the number could begin rising faster now as H1N1 mutations take hold.</p>

</p>
<p>The raging <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> assault on the federal Liberal Party and its current leadership by Janine Krieber, wife of former leader Stéphane Dion, was pretty much what's known in the news biz as a one-day wonder.</p>
<p>Her charge that under Michael Ignatieff's unsteady leadership the party is on its way to becoming "a poor little thing" that risks "winding up in the trashbin of history" made a front-page splash on Monday, but was largely dismissed by Tuesday as mostly the fury of a woman whose husband was scorned.</p>
<p>Ignatieff himself was wisely too gracious to rise to the bait, saying only that he'd talked to Dion about it and been assured of his continued devotion to the party, even though his wife had figuratively burned her membership card in full view of the world. He left it to minions to lay down the party line on the incident, like Ontario MP John McCallum who said, "She has her own story and her own views. I don't think she's an opinion leader in the Liberal Party and therefore I don't think this story will last for long."</p>
<p>Indeed, by midweek when the episode got any mention at all, it was more as a cautionary tale for people under the delusion that everyone with access to their <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page is their friend, and a bracing reminder that confiding anything to the Internet in any form that they're not prepared to have the world know is reckless folly.</p>
<p>But while it may have been more of a reflection on Krieber's state of mind than the state of the Liberal Party, it was another embarrassment, however petty, in what has turned out to a year from hell for what was once but is manifestly no longer Canada's mightiest political party. A year marked by public relations gaffes, tactical blunders, dismal by-election results and a run of discouraging polls.</p>
<p>No one worth taking more seriously than Krieber is prepared to say that the Liberal Party is destined for history's scrap heap, but what has been sorely trashed in recent years is the Liberal brand of now bygone days as Canada's "natural governing party."</p>
<p>"Lets not exaggerate," said Université Laval political scientist Jean Crête. "Big parties like that have a lot of resources and can rebound. A big party like the Liberals doesn't disappear just like that." But he agrees that today's Liberal Party is a far cry from the force it used to be. "It's not likely that the Liberals will disappear but it is likely the Conservatives could remain strong for some time to come. They don't look like the habitual government any more."</p>
<p>If anything, the Liberal Party looks to be in worse shape and with dimmer prospects than at any time in the past half century, worse possibly than since the days they were up against John A. Macdonald. In last year's federal election the Liberals were cut down to 26.2 per cent of the vote, their worst popular showing since the country's first election, in 1867. Latest polls have shown the Liberals deeply mired in that range of popular support with the Conservatives nudging toward the 40-per-cent threshold that would give them majority rule for another half decade.</p>
<p>Come January the Liberals will have been four years out of power, and with dimmer prospects of regaining it than at this year's outset. It has looked bad for the Liberals before, but not this bad. When it looked as though the Liberals might force an election this fall, and possibly return to power, their polling numbers tanked.</p>
<p>They were down deep 50 years ago, having suffered their worst defeat of the century the year before to John Diefenbaker and what were then the Progressive Conservatives, scraping by with a mere 49 seats, though with a better popular vote score than the Liberals registered last year. But after four years into purgatory the Liberals were resurgent and in the 1962 election they drove Diefenbaker's record Commons majority down to a minority. The following year they drove them out of office and under Lester Pearson embarked on a historic era of governance with epochal innovations such as medicare, the Canada pension plan, a host of public welfare programs and a homebred Canadian flag.</p>
<p>A repeat performance on that scale is more than improbable, in part because the Liberals are far behind the scenario in terms of gathering momentum and in part because the supply of trademark Liberal big ideas has been largely exhausted. "The Liberal stock in trade from Pearson to Chrétien was the creation of new social programs," noted La Presse political columnist Lysiane Gagnon this week. "Today the social safety net has almost reached full measure. Given the current budgetary constraints there is not much more the Liberals can invent."</p>
<p>Big-ticket social innovations, like the national daycare program the Liberals have lately cherished, are a bad sell in these economically strapped times, agreed Crête. "It's not necessarily a good horse to ride into an election campaign, People now want temporary programs while we're feeling the effects of the recession. There are people who will support a daycare program, but not enough to win you an election."</p>
<p>In 1984, the Liberals suffered an even worse whipping than from Diefenbaker at the hands of Brian Mulroney and his reconstructed Conservatives, hammered down to near-rump status with a piddling 40 seats and a paltry 28 per cent of the vote, though still slightly better than its current popular standing. Four years later, however, the party's prospects were on the upswing, even with John Turner's erratic leadership, as a series of scandals beset the Mulroney government and public opinion progressively soured toward the prime minister. They lost the next election too and it took them another five years to regain power, but the cracks in the Tory edifice that culminated in its collapse in the 1993 election were showing even then.</p>
<p>Politician turned broadcast analyst Jean Lapierre was there for the 1984 debacle as a Liberal MP and said this week that even then things didn't look as bad for the party as they do today, that back then it was a different Liberal Party than it is today.</p>
<p>"We knew in '84 that we had to go down the road to Damascus, but there was an esprit de corps in the party, there was still energy and solidarity in the caucus. Everybody said, 'We know it's going to be tough, but we'll get over it, we'll rebuild.' What I see now is that the old esprit de corps is no longer there. In the caucus it seems to be everyone for themselves, people most concerned with saving their own skins. You don't see a strong will to save the whole. In my 30 years in politics I've never seen the party in such bad shape."</p>
<p>He said the Liberal problem in part is that the party has relied too much on the old saw that elections are not won so much by opposition parties as lost by governments, and have been living on hope that the Harper government will implode rather than cobbling up a credible alternative governing plan. "They thought soldiers coming home from Afghanistan in body bags would do in the Conservatives, but that hasn't happened. The same with the economic crisis and the H1N1 epidemic. But every time they counted on the government tripping up they wound up looking foolish. They carried on as though they think power is simply due to them."</p>
<p>Nor have the high hopes for Ignatieff's leadership panned out. Liberal support surged in the early months after he was handed the leadership, but receded as time went on and plummeted when he boldly declared he was ready to defeat the government and take over as prime minister. Janine Krieber isn't alone in thinking that dumping her husband for Ignatieff wasn't the best of moves. As one Liberal MP with a cruel streak anonymously confided recently: "We were in such a hurry to dump Dion that we wound up with John Turner."</p>
<p>Ignatieff appears to have lost what traction with voters he may have had at the outset, said Lapierre. "At first there was a sympathetic curiosity toward him, certainly here in Quebec. People wanted to get to know him, they were saying, 'who is this guy?' Now that they've got to know him better, I hear them saying, 'Is there anything there?' People have a hard time telling where he stands on anything."</p>
<p>Liberals maintain they are pulling up their bootstraps and girding their loins. Ignatieff lately purged his much maligned staff and brought in some practised hands from past Liberal glory days, a move politically akin to a hockey coach firing his team. In March, they plan to hold a high level thinkers conference in Montreal, touted as the successor to previous such exercises that presaged a Liberal restoration after the Diefenbaker and Mulroney interregnums.</p>
<p>For now, however, the best that can be said of the Liberals is that they remain at least the standing governing alternative to the Conservatives, said Crête.</p>
<p>"The NDP isn't strong enough to take over the space still occupied by the Liberals. For the Liberals to fade away. the NDP would have to draw a lot of Liberal voters while at the same time many Liberals go over to the Conservatives. That's not very probable, but even so, it's hard to see how the Liberals will get out of the situation they're in now. Maybe with time, but who knows how much time."</p>

</div><div>By Johanna Weidner   </div>

</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Upset crowds standing outside in the cold and rain, people turned away, stern police guarding doors, staff struggling to explain why the wait was so long.</p>
<p>The first few community H1N1 immunization clinics hosted by Region of Waterloo Public Health were chaos.</p>
<p>Handling H1N1 flu season and the mass immunization program has been a major learning experience for public health and not without its headaches.</p>
<p>"With every new activity, there's going to be some learning that occurs," said Lesley Rintche, the region's manager of vaccine programs and a site co-ordinator at the clinics who supervised staff and logistics.</p>
<p>Long lines formed early in the morning for the first clinics, many hours before public health arrived to start giving shots. Some clinics were closed after being overwhelmed by demand.</p>
<p>Many people who lined up did not fit into the priority groups eligible for the vaccine and left frustrated - often healthy people or seniors who traditionally are first in line for the seasonal flu shot.</p>
<p>"We needed to turn away a lot of people and that's not easy to do," Rintche said.</p>
<p>Police were enlisted for crowd control.</p>
<p>"We mainly had the police there to help us with crowd control because we knew there would be a large demand for the vaccine," Rintche said.</p>
<p>Dealing with such a crush of people needing vaccinations urgently is uncommon for public health except during rare outbreaks, like the rash of meningitis outbreak in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>Rintche said pulling off the clinics requires a huge collaboration, from health inspectors, planners and clerical staff at public health to emergency medical services, security, public facilities and St. John Ambulance.</p>
<p>"Everyone has been working together on this," Rintche said.</p>
<p>Recent clinics are running much more smoothly with shorts waits of about 40 minutes to an hour or two.</p>
<p>People coming for their shot now are surprised at the organization after hearing horror stories of early clinics - the confusion, crowds and long waits.</p>
<p>"We've gotten so much positive feedback," Rintche said. "It's nice for us to hear some of the learning we had early on and the changes we made have turned out positive."</p>
<p>Four more clinics are scheduled for next week, and public health plans to continue offering the vaccine as long as there's a demand. By mid-week, 122,000 vaccine doses were distributed at public clinics, hospitals and doctor's offices.</p>
<p>Anyone with questions can call the H1N1 line at 519-883-2289 or the pandemic website at waterlooregionpandemic.ca.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Should vitamin C be used to treat H1N1?</b>
</div><div>Dr. Gifford-Jones   </div>
<div>630 words</div><div>28 November 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>F2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>A recent newspaper headline read, "Researchers look to common, cheap medications to help H1N1 patients."</p>
<p>Viral experts are wondering whether cholesterol-lowering drugs and steroids could help to save the sickest H1N1 patients. If these researchers studied history, they would learn how Dr. Frederick R. Klenner saved an important patient, and many others, from life-threatening viral infections.</p>
<p>In the Clinical Guide to the use of Vitamin C, Dr. Lendon Smith details Klenner's clinical experiences. He had cured case after case of viral disease by massive doses of vitamin C. And when you read these cases, it boggles the mind as to why this research has collected so much dust.</p>
<p>Fifty-six years ago, a seven-year-old boy had been ill for six weeks due to recurring attacks of influenza. He had been treated with sulfa, penicillin and five to 10,000 milligrams (mg) of oral vitamin C. But he suddenly dropped into a stupor. Klenner quickly gave him an intravenous injection of 6,000 mgs of vitamin C. Five minutes later the boy was awake and asked, "What happened?" He received three further injections of vitamin C every six hours and was fully recovered in 24 hours. Klenner was an American researcher and family practitioner in North Carolina. In 1949, he reported this momentous news to the American Medical Association. During the epidemic of poliomyelitis, he had cured 60 out of 60 patients suffering from this disease by using massive doses of vitamin C, sometimes 300,000 mg daily. None had been left with any paralysis. Yet no one appears to have listened to him.</p>
<p>This was the same year I developed polio in my final year at Harvard Medical School. But none of its distinguished professors ever considered or even knew about the use of vitamin C in treating viral disease. And as far as I know, 60 years later, neither they nor other doctors are aware of this fact.</p>
<p>In February 1948, Klenner reported in the journal Southern Medicine and Surgery that 42 cases of viral pneumonia had been treated by vitamin C. Other doctors were using X-rays as therapy. His treatment was 1,000 mg of vitamin C every six hours for mild cases. Three to seven injections were required for clinical recovery.</p>
<p>In June 1957, Klenner reported in the Tri-State Medical Journal what he called the "insidious virus." He described the case of a 19-month-old baby who had a minor cold for two weeks. Then suddenly, instead of improving, the child became cold to the touch, semi-comatose, his arms and legs completely paralyzed. Two thousand mg of vitamin C were injected on admission to the hospital and 1,000 more, one hour later. Then 1,000 mg were given orally every four hours. In eight hours, the baby started to recover and the paralysis disappeared. Penicillin was given to guard against bacterial infection and the baby returned home in five days.</p>
<p>Today, an increasing number of people are dying from the H1N1 virus. I obviously wonder (and hope doctors reading this column will share my view), how many of these patients' lives could have been saved by large doses of vitamin C?</p>
<p>Klenner's message was simple. If a serious infection is present, but the cause unknown, doctors should prescribe large doses of vitamin C while they diagnose.</p>
<p>Moreover, just as a small dose of a narcotic will not stop cancer pain, neither will a small dose of vitamin C stop viral disease. But are there any doctors who treat desperately ill H1N1 patients willing to prescribe large doses of vitamin C?</p>

<p>I got my H1N1 shot this week. I went to the clinic on College Avenue, where I was told the lines were short. When I got there, however, there must have been 20 cars in the lot and a bus was parked at the door. Nuts.</p>
<p>I went in anyway and discovered that I was the only -- the lonely -- person in line. The cars in the lot belonged to the dozen or so bored nurses, and the clutch of security guards, greeters and handlers. The bus? Who knows.</p>
<p>A security guy told me there is never any waiting at the College Avenue clinic. "You should always come here," he said.</p>
<p>Well, actually, once is enough, but I took his meaning.</p>
<p>I got the shot mostly because I'm a new grandad (Ryan Charles, the perfect son of Megan and Perry Allard, thank you for asking).</p>
<p>But I would have done it anyway for the simple reason that once inoculated you are not a danger to yourself -- or anyone else.</p>
<p>That makes it a duty, or it should.</p>
<p>But given that, maybe, 15 per cent of Canadians have taken the plunge to the shoulder, that would appear to be a conviction that few share.</p>
<p>Why is that? I talked to Dr. Ethan Rubinstein, head of the infectious diseases section, University of Manitoba school of medicine.</p>
<p>He said that even in the planning stages it was not expected that more than 40 per cent of Manitobans would get a shot. But given that 15 per cent to 20 per cent had been "naturally" immunized by getting sick in the first wave of H1N1 in the spring, and that 15 per cent to 20 per cent of people older than 65 likely were naturally immunized by past swine flu outbreaks (including my 95-year-old father Leo who likely has been safe since the 1918 outbreak) it meant that something like 70 per cent of the population would be immune by, say, Christmas.</p>
<p>And when that large a proportion is immune, a "herd immunity" comes into play so that the holdouts get the benefit of living amongst a population that mostly poses no threat to them.</p>
<p>But that, of course, has not happened because, on the evidence to date, a greater proportion of people than expected are betting that this strain will remain "mild" as will the "third wave" next spring.</p>
<p>But what if they bet wrong? Earlier this fall, when two young people died suddenly, there was the beginnings of a panic and conjecture along apocalyptic lines. Suddenly, so-called queue-jumpers were pariahs shamefully throwing women and children from metaphoric lifeboats. And then when it became clear that the coincidence of the two sad deaths was simply that -- a tragic coincidence -- well, there was no longer a queue to jump.</p>
<p>Dr. Rubinstein said the phenomenon of "chronic optimism" in the face of a pandemic threat -- or more darkly, the refusal to act in interests of the greater good -- is something that will need to be studied after this cloud has passed.</p>
<p>But he noted that in 1903, the state of Massachusetts passed a law requiring all citizens to be immunized against a prevalence of small pox. The fine for not doing so was $5.</p>
<p>The law was challenged twice, finally going to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1905 in a case called Jacobson vs Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Jacobson argued that every freeman has the right "to care for his own body and health in such a way as seems to him best."</p>
<p>The court, however, found for the state, saying, in essence, that in a civilized society everyone accepts the bargain that individuals give up some liberty in exchange for the benefits of the civilization.</p>
<p>"Jacobson sought to enjoy the benefits of his neighbours being vaccinated without personally accepting the risks inherent in vaccination," according to the Louisiana State University Medical and Public Health Law Site.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2009, and what do we find? We find, Dr. Rubinstein said, the recent ruling of the New York Supreme Court.</p>
<p>When the state decided that all health workers should be vaccinated to protect themselves and people they would be treating, some health workers balked, arguing essentially the same thing as Jacobson had argued a century earlier. But this time, the state lost and the court found in favour of the individual rights of the complainants.</p>
<p>Is that progress? And if it is so deemed, will it still be a progressive decision if "wave three" catches most all of us freely unprepared in a civilized society?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Is the H1N1 vaccine safe and effective? We can't really say; Weighing all the factors is difficult, given the scarcity of solid science</b>
</div><div>Christopher A.Shaw   </div>
<div>Special to the Sun</div>
<div>1242 words</div><div>28 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>C5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>In recent months, widespread concern --sometimes bordering on hysteria -- about an H1N1 influenza pandemic has become firmly fixed in the public mind. Statements from health ministers and other officials about the potential for the disease to wreak social havoc have heightened the sense of dread. Long lineups for those wanting the vaccine combined with delays in delivery have further stoked national angst.</p>
<p>Amidst all of this, dissenters have sometimes been branded as medical Luddites, "bad Canadians," or wild-eyed conspiracy theorists. Yet, H1N1 vaccine critics have usually only asked three fundamental questions, none of which necessarily justify ad hominem attacks on their motives or scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>The questions are these: How dangerous is the H1N1 flu strain? Are the vaccines developed against it effective? And, are there any hazards to the vaccine itself, potential health risks that could in some cases have more serious consequences than the disease itself?</p>
<p>The answer to the first question is based on various statistics already in the public domain on various government websites. For example, Australia has already finished its influenza season and the H1N1 virus appears to have run its course. During a "normal" year in Australia, the various flu strains kill between 2,500 and 3,000 people; the H1N1 strain in 2009 accounted for 182 deaths. In Canada and British Columbia, H1N1 fatalities currently stand at 250 and 32, respectively. In contrast, some 2,500 influenza deaths occur annually in Canada, 400 to 800 of these in B.C.</p>
<p>Arguably, H1N1-induced fatalities in Canada could dramatically increase between now and the spring, but the available evidence to date does not appear to support the notion that this virus is either particularly virulent or lethal. Hence, the World Health Organization's initial concerns about the potential of the virus to kill massive numbers of people globally have not yet been realized and may thus have been considerably overestimated.</p>
<p>In regard to vaccine efficacy -- the reduction in disease incidence in those vaccinated versus those not -- the answer also hinges on several observations. First, recent data show that influenza vaccines against type A influenza viruses have an efficacy rate ranging from under 30 per cent to somewhere above 70 per cent, depending on how the vaccine is prepared. For the H1N1 vaccine in Canada (ArepanrixTM), data provided by the manufacturer (GlaskoSmithKline (GSK)) in an October 21, 2009 "product information leaflet" suggest that 94 to 100 per cent "seropositivity" occurs following administration of the vaccine. For the H1N1 studies, seropositivity reflects antibody production against parts of the virus. These numbers are quite impressive, but it has to be noted that the sample sizes were quite small, consisting of fewer than 70 individuals in each of several treatment groups.</p>
<p>Another problem is that seropositivity alone does not necessarily translate into efficacy, the latter only determined once all of the data on vaccinated and non-vaccinated populations have been compiled.</p>
<p>In addition, a good reason for skepticism arises from a comparison of GSK's seropositivity data for the two versions of the vaccine, specifically with or without the "adjuvant." An adjuvant is a chemical added to vaccines to provide a strong immune system response. In the Arepanrix vaccine, the adjuvant is squalene, a biochemical precursor to cholesterol. In the GSK tests, two different amounts of the virus' antigen-producing component were used with the non-squalene variant containing about 400 per cent more antigen. These data make it difficult to determine the true seropositivity of the antigen alone, an interpretation supported by the animal studies in the same information package which showed no disease protection for ferrets vaccinated with the non-adjuvanted form of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Finally, just how safe is the vaccine for human use? The same information sheets provide some insights: A number of potential treatment groups were not evaluated at all, including most of those under 18 or over 60. Additionally, the adjuvanted form of the vaccine induced a number of immediate post-vaccine complaints, some of them potentially involving the nervous system. For example, 14.3 per cent of those vaccinated with the adjuvanted vaccine reported headaches; half this number occurred with the non-adjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>Given the importance of animal studies, usually considered the precursors to human trials, GSK's ferret study did not use an statistically appropriate number of animals to allow proper analysis, had no real control group, and did appear to conduct behavioural or anatomical analyses of the nervous systems of the treated animals. Since a main concern about squalene (as well as the mercury compound, Thimerosal, added to the H1N1 vaccine as a preservative) is the potential impact on the nervous system, the lack of nervous system data is troubling. GSK did try, however, to evaluate the potential impact on pregnancy with two studies on pregnant rats. One of these describes, amongst other problems of the rat pups, "delayed neurobehavioural maturation", whatever that may actually mean. GSK concluded that, ". . . Not all findings were observed in both studies, and hence the toxicological significance is uncertain".</p>
<p>Uncertain, perhaps, but such uncertainty should raise more questions and trigger additional studies.</p>
<p>None of this is particularly surprising to me as a neuroscientist. Two peer-reviewed and published studies from my laboratory have previously documented adverse long-term nervous system outcomes in mice exposed to one of the most common vaccine adjuvants, aluminum hydroxide.</p>
<p>In addition, squalene administration studied in the first of these studies demonstrated significant learning disabilities. It may be noteworthy that squalene has not been widely used previously in North American vaccine manufacture due to past safety concerns.</p>
<p>The questions posed at the beginning of this article now have tentative answers: The H1N1 influenza has not become the horrific pandemic that it was expected to be, the efficacy of the vaccine may be less than hoped for, and the safety data based on animal studies seem highly questionable. These outcomes can only leave the public in a quandary as individuals try to evaluate the potential harm from the disease against any potential benefit/harm from the vaccine.</p>
<p>Public health officials will likely argue that the identified problems do not negate what was perceived as an urgent need for the vaccine in the shortest possible time in the face of the expected pandemic, nor do such problems address the danger that could arise if the H1N1 virus mutates into a far more lethal strain. Both may be valid points. The first, however, presumes that health officials acted with sufficient knowledge in hand, a conclusion that now seems unlikely. The second fails to recognize that if H1N1 changes significantly due to mutation, the existing vaccine might not be of much use at all.</p>
<p>The flip side of the grim prospect for a future pandemic disaster is the potential for an increase in neurological disease rates at some future date.</p>
<p>Without a lot more solid science, deciding whether to get the vaccine or not may, for most people, be less a process of rational decision making than a toss of the coin.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Anti-'mall' blather diminishes Lansdowne opponents</b>

</p>
<p>I didn't start out as a strong supporter of Lansdowne Live, but the ridiculous arguments of the opponents of the development are turning me into one.</p>
<p>The most recent rebuttal of the project is that the city has allowed -- no, actually "slapped" -- a shopping mall next to a World Heritage site, namely the Rideau Canal. The latest person to drink Clive Doucet's bathwater, Tom Korski, wrote a column in the Hill Times which was then circulated faster than the H1N1 vaccine in the Maple Leafs' dressing room. Opponents of Lansdowne Live seemed to think it was the definitive argument against the project.</p>
<p>Korski repeats the word "mall" nine times in his column. Apparently that's the only word you need to hear in order to know it's a bad idea. For some people, malls rank one notch below tar ponds on their list of appealing land use. For the people who look down their noses at retail development, I have one question: Where do you plan to do your Christmas shopping?</p>
<p>The new line of argument conveniently overlooks the fact that Lansdowne Live isn't close to being Bayshore on Bank Street. But even if it was, who says you can't build commercial space next to a heritage site, or in this case, across the street from one?</p>
<p>There's nothing in the heritage criteria that discourages retail. Several historic downtown areas, including the entire city of Quito, are World Heritage sites. I'm guessing the 1.4 million residents of the Ecuadorean capital don't have to leave the city to buy their groceries.</p>
<p>The Rideau Canal is 200 kilometres long. Are the anti-development types now arguing that nowhere along that stretch should anyone be able to purchase goods from a vendor? Should the restaurants that overlook the canal be torn down? Should we no longer allow Beavertail huts during Winterlude? What about the Rideau Centre, which stands a few metres from the foot of the canal? I guess we'll have to tear it down. It is a mall, after all, unlike what is actually planned for Lansdowne.</p>
<p>Lansdowne Live partner Roger Greenberg has made it clear he wants a different kind of retail on the site, and so do city councillors.</p>
<p>Greenberg describes a collection of shops like those you might find at an old-town waterfront or other revitalized historical site.</p>
<p>Of course, some people might point out that when it's time to rent out the space the partnership might not turn away a prospect that doesn't fit the criteria.</p>
<p>However, even if there's nothing in the city agreement to constrain the partnership from leasing to a chain retailer, there are some practical limitations. For one, if the developers want Lansdowne to be a destination, there is no point putting in the same chains that could be found at Bayshore or St. Laurent. Why would anyone navigate Bank Street and pay to park so they could shop at the same stores they would find at the suburban malls?</p>
<p>Also, the developers have agreed to a design process that requires city approval and consults experts who will push for unique design and content. Finally, these are local business people who have to work in the city so they are not likely to want the backlash that would come from promising something different and then leasing out the space to a bunch of chains and big-box stores.</p>
<p>The retail, which is planned for Bank Street and not along the canal, will actually connect the Glebe with Ottawa South. The Glebe BIA has raised concerns about traffic and other logistics, but it embraces the new retail as a benefit to the area. Meanwhile, the side of Lansdowne that actually connects with the canal will actually be transformed into more and better green space.</p>
<p>When Korski is not suggesting the proposed redevelopment of Lansdowne will destroy almost every shop in the Glebe, he's referring to the current site as a "Victorian fairground" which, naturally, must be preserved.</p>
<p>Forget the fact that the people in the Glebe hate SuperEx and have always wanted it gone. Now the argument against Lansdowne Live is that we are destroying "the last 19th century downtown fairground in urban Canada."</p>
<p>Hmm, I wonder why all the other ones are already gone. Maybe because downtown fairs, like other Victorian artifacts such as chamber pots and corsets, have outlived their usefulness.</p>
<p>When <span class="companylink">Loblaws</span> was planning a superstore in Westboro, a few people forecast the end of the neighbourhood. The opposite turned out to be true. Like <span class="companylink">Loblaws</span> did for Westboro, the new development at Lansdowne will help to revitalize the Glebe and Ottawa South.</p>
<p>Putting some unique retail on the Bank Street side of the site, following a thorough design process, does not amount to slapping down a mall and it doesn't diminish the Rideau Canal in any way. If opponents of Lansdowne Live want to keep fighting up until the final vote in June, they have every right. But they would have a better chance of convincing councillors and the public of their case if they started making sense.</p>

</p>
<p>When the Hebrew poet poked God and said, "Are your wonders known in the darkness, or your saving help in the land of forgetfulness?" he or she was after a reaction. The psalmist was provoking God into clearing the land of corruption and bringing salvation. For if, in the lyricist's mind, a divine rupture was not to come, too much would be lost, and who then would know or be left to commune with God?</p>
<p>It seems to me the psalmist's rhetorical question has jumped time and fallen like a hot stone in the now. The critical difference is it is God who is poking and calling us, and it is we Christians who have moved into the land of forgetfulness.</p>
<p>In the land of forgetfulness, we seldom question wagers of war, corporate-owned media, pharmaceutical companies owned in part by policy-makers and academic institutions propped up by oil companies.</p>
<p>Is it a condition of our investiture? Is it because we Christians are primary shareholders in those corporations and institutions? Is it because of our capital holdings in the machinery of competition and conflict?</p>
<p>Have we grown fleshy, obtuse, unwilling and unable to mount a cry for help? And when our state of amnesia is threatened, do we bristle and move farther within the walls?</p>
<p>In the land of forgetfulness, we follow religious leaders who divide their sheep into fractious blocks and call it "rightly dividing the word of truth." As if what mattered was right creed over right action. As if doctrine trumps love, and truth was found in ascent and not in doing. As if the recent Catholic overture to conservative Anglicans means there is an ecumenical breeze blowing.</p>
<p>The church, too often satisfied to write prescriptions for the unruffled life, has apparently lost the capacity to induce crisis. And it's crisis we need in these times of pseudo-crisis. The economy, H1N1, Iran's nuclear achievements, terrorist threats, global warming-- these together still do not add up to a first-order crisis.</p>
<p>Fear and ignorance is our crisis. Lack of courage, stunted moral intelligence and stagnant mercy are our crises. We've forgotten this, and that's the crisis.</p>
<p>The farmer/poet Wendell Berry said, "I may have missed something but I know of no Christian nation and of no Christian leader from whose conduct the teachings of Christ could be inferred."</p>
<p>In the land of forgetfulness, we herald a jaw set foolishly only because it's set. In our city, we just finished doing the soft-shoe around an unrepentant ex-American president, calling him kin because he's a proponent of amassing, protecting, acquiring and consolidating.</p>
<p>We've forgotten that the George W. Bush administration was a moral crisis, a crisis that could have cleared the air. It could have offered us a new look at where we are going, even offered us a startling glimmer of who we are becoming.</p>
<p>Here in Canada we've simply imitated the policies and procedures of our more powerful neighbour. Did we suppose that because we elected a Christian prime minister there was change in the air?</p>
<p>No question we are passionate about our beliefs and our principles. But our beliefs lack substance and our desires are anemic, mere mimicry of the perceived powerful. We swell our heads and wear ourselves out to be like them.</p>
<p>The prophets we need today must douse us with cold water, wake us to what it might mean to be human. It's true, as Jesuit Daniel Berrigan has said, that becoming human is so difficult that we're legitimately shocked by the courage it requires. The temptation is to stay to well-marked, well-guarded roads; to keep our ears shut to the minority voice. But that wilderness voice may be our salvation.</p>
<p>Today, protest may be the only way to recover our humanity. We may mock, humour, chide or rail against protests and protesters, but they are very often the means to recover our memory and vision.</p>
<p>Should we envision and live our lives in love, without fretting about achievements, we may yet see our "reflection high above the wall." And in that light, the anarchy of mercy may take hold. And Jesus' gospel of compassion and equality take root.</p>

<div>THE H1N1 PANDEMIC</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>As flu deaths mount, scientists unravelling how it kills; While polls show public concern over H1N1 stagnating, researchers find worrying pattern of infections among younger adult victims</b>

</p>
<p>The lungs were heavy, difficult to deflate, and beefy looking. To the pathologist who held them, they belied their own anatomy, resembling a liver.</p>
<p>They belonged to an Ontarian who, until contracting H1N1, had been healthy and in early middle age. Within days, the person was dead, being dissected at Toronto's University Health Network. Pathologists concurred on the likely mechanism of death – a violent reaction of the immune system, most common among the young and people in their prime, called a cytokine storm.</p>
<p>“Once the inflammatory cascade gets established, it's like a runaway freight train – it's just going to keep going,” said pathologist David Hwang, who consulted on the autopsy samples. “In some of these patients, even if you clear the virus, the cytokine storm has already taken hold and it takes on a life of its own.”</p>
<p>It's a fatal irony: A robust immune system can be hazardous to your health. In some cases, it's the reaction to the flu – more so than the virus itself – that sets off the death spiral.</p>
<p>So far, 309 people have died across Canada since the pandemic began in the spring, and roughly one-third had no underlying health conditions. That challenges the collective memory of a population that had never seen an influenza strike down people in their salad days. And it is reminiscent of 1918, when upward of 50 million worldwide died from the Spanish flu, many believed caught in cytokine storms.</p>
<p>This year, even as polls show public concern over H1N1 is levelling off, there has been a sharp spike in H1N1 fatalities nationwide, with 208 new deaths reported since Nov. 3. And interviews with intensive-care specialists and microbiologists reveal many Canadian casualties experienced one or more of the following: viral pneumonia, a devastating secondary bacterial infection, or a cytokine storm. These conditions can strike together, to deadly effect.</p>
<p>When a person becomes infected by H1N1 or other viruses, the immune system releases cytokines – small proteins that help recruit cells to destroy the virus. Side effects include fever, chills and muscle aches that for the vast majority of people are transient. But in some, the immune response goes berserk – a cytokine storm that can rage even after the virus has cleared.</p>
<p>That inflammatory response causes fluid buildup in the lungs. The simple act of breathing – getting oxygen in and carbon dioxide out – becomes too daunting even for a high-tech ventilator. Damage caused by viral injury makes lungs vulnerable to a bacterial infection.</p>
<p>While the H1N1 virus still kills the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, it can attack the young and healthy with shocking velocity.</p>
<p>“This is not the same influenza [as seasonal flu]. It's literally a different disease,” said Winnipeg-based intensive care and infectious diseases specialist Anand Kumar. “… Any rules that anybody had about what influenza does or doesn't do, they're gone.”</p>
<p>Dr. Kumar has treated 30patients with H1N1, reviewed a further 30 and studied eight autopsies since the pandemic began this past spring. Virtually all of his patients – and those cases he reviewed – developed viral pneumonia, sometimes with a secondary lung infection. Among those who died, nearly all succumbed to respiratory failure.</p>
<p>With these patients, the body tries to expel the virus through an inflammatory response, which causes the buildup of fluid. Blood vessels leak, creating a frothy pink pool of liquid in the lungs.</p>
<p>It can be an unmerciful end. Some of Dr. Kumar's patients have spent weeks or occasionally months in medically induced comas. Some go so quickly they never reach a ventilator. A storm with no warning</p>
<p>There is no lab test for a cytokine storm. Typically, if death from H1N1 is sudden and acute – defined as being within a matter of just a few days – a cytokine storm is suspected.</p>
<p>That is especially true if routine cultures, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus, are negative, said Andrew Simor, head of microbiology and infectious diseases at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto.</p>
<p>“But if the tempo of the disease was they had a flu-like illness for four or five days and then they developed pneumonia,” Dr. Simor said, “then you start to think about a secondary bacterial infection.”</p>
<p>The experience in Canada is similar to that in the U.S., where officials said this week that they observed a worrying pattern of serious bacterial infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, mostly among younger adults not normally vulnerable to them.</p>
<p>That was also the case with the early middle-aged Ontarian, one of the few who underwent an autopsy after dying of H1N1.</p>
<p>While the upper respiratory tract – the gateway for H1N1 – looked fine, destruction lay in tiny lung air sacs where gas exchanges occur, said pathologist Jagdish Butany, who performed the autopsy. The person died quickly, within a few days after being infected with H1N1. Rapid inflammation caused excessive damage to the lungs, which caused fluid buildup – suggesting a cytokine storm got the fatal reaction rolling.</p>
<p>“Young up to middle-aged people are much more likely to not just get it,” Dr. Butany said, “but to really suffer and be admitted and perhaps succumb to it.”</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>The cytokine storm</p>
<p>A cytokine storm is a mechanism that can be evoked by an influenza virus, such as H N . Typically, it is marked by a rapid death ñ within just a few days of onset.</p>
<p>1 Epithelial cells are infected with H N , which replicates and infects other cells.</p>
<p>Epithelial cells Line hollow organs and glands and those on the outer body</p>
<p>2 Macrophage infection</p>
<p>Macrophage White blood cell that surrounds and kills micro-organisms</p>
<p>3 Macrophage activated</p>
<p>Chemoattracted proinflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>4 T cell activated</p>
<p>T Cell White blood cell involved with the immune system</p>
<p>5 Uncontrolled exuberant immune response</p>
<p>Cytokines Produced by white blood cells in response to a perceived threat. They are the critical means by which one immune cell communicates with another</p>
<p>Cytokines send signals to immune cells such as T-cells and macrophages that there is an invader in the body such as a H N virus. They also tell the immune system to produce more cytokines. Normally, this feedback loop is self-limiting but in some instances production goes into overdrive – a cytokine storm.</p>
<p>Overstimulation of the immune system can cause a dangerously high fever and damage internal organs. Lung damage is particularly prevalent causing necrosis, tissue destruction, influx of leukocytes (white blood cells) and dilatation of blood vessel.</p>

<p>It is striking to sit in the House of Commons during Question Period and watch how the big issues of the day are divvied up along gender lines.</p>
<p>Consider two of the significant stories of this fall – the H1N1 crisis and the allegations of torture of Afghan detainees. When it came to dealing with H1N1, women MPs asked the questions and the female Health Minister answered. This changed dramatically, however, when the story moved on to guns, war and torture. That's when the guys took over. For the most part, the women sat quietly in their seats.</p>
<p>As a leading expert on women in politics, the University of Toronto's Sylvia Bashevkin says this is not uncommon – women traditionally deal with the butter issues (social spending, health and the arts) and men with the gun issues.</p>
<p>“What cabinet positions women historically were offered were portfolios that were seen as a logical extensional of a traditional maternal role: health, education, welfare, culture,” Ms. Bashevkin said.</p>
<p>There is a gender bias, too, when the issue is the economy. The Finance Minister is male (and always has been in the federal government) and so are his opposition critics.</p>
<p>When Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff is away from the House, he calls on his buddies Ralph Goodale and Bob Rae to stand in for him. And when the Prime Minister is away, Transport Minister John Baird or Industry Minister Tony Clement take over.</p>
<p>The women play no real starring roles.</p>
<p>Should we care? Does it matter? Is it a problem?</p>
<p>Anita Neville, a Winnipeg MP and chair of the Liberal women's caucus, doesn't entirely buy in to the women-are-butter-men-are-guns theory.</p>
<p>“I think there tends to be some stereotyping of it, but I don't think it's universal,” Ms. Neville said.</p>
<p>She said that she has asked a question about torture in Afghanistan; she sits on the Commons Defence committee and has been to the special parliamentary committee examining the torture issue. (It is overwhelmingly male, and men appear on the political panels on television to debate the issue.)</p>
<p>Part of the problem, Ms. Neville said, is that the House of Commons has simply not enough women to go around.</p>
<p>Women hold 69 of 308 Commons seats, about 22 per cent. Women's groups, such as Equal Voice Canada, want to see the numbers rise to 30-per-cent representation. To get there, though, will take leadership.</p>
<p>Despite their numbers, Ms. Neville remains positive about the impact of women in the House. She said female MPs can play a big role behind the scenes. For example, she said that the Liberal women's caucus pushed former prime minister Jean Chrétien to resist sending Canadian troops into Iraq.</p>
<p>But is behind-the-scenes good enough? Ms. Bashevkin clearly doesn't think so.</p>
<p>She said that it's important for young people of both genders to see women operating in all aspects of public policy. It is equally important to see male politicians in non-traditional roles.</p>
<p>“It makes public policy seem like it's about all of us and not just some narrow spectrum either of only women who care about social policy or men who are equipped to know about whether it's the economy or foreign affairs or defence,” she said.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful defences of the importance of a national child-care program came from former Liberal cabinet minister Ken Dryden, Ms. Bashevkin said, adding that he made a big impression on her students.</p>
<p>“I think social policy, when voiced by a man, and defence or economic or foreign policy, when voiced by a woman, because it's sort of breaking with stereotype, can often be more compelling, more resonant and more remembered,” she said.</p>
<p>Just look at Mike Savage. The big, burly Liberal MP from Nova Scotia plays against type as the opposition critic for human resources, which is traditionally considered a female portfolio.</p>
<p>Mr. Savage asks pointed questions and demands answers on homelessness and employment insurance reform. Who answers? The female minister, of course, Diane Finley.</p>

<p>If Whistler qualifies, this could be a tale of two cities. In Vancouver, at least, it looks as if people will be able to say, of the Winter Olympics, that it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.</p>
<p>And how the 16,500 police, armed forces and private security mercenaries -- with another 750 on standby in case swine flu decimates the ranks ---will police this extravaganza will do much to determine the balance.</p>
<p>God bless the athletes, and their coaches and trainers, their doctors and physiotherapists, their families and friends who have helped bring them to this crowning experience. But they've become little more than an excuse for the wider Olympian orgy that's coming.</p>
<p>The best of times, certainly, will be had by the political and corporate swells who'll be allowed into the restaurants and bars that are being taken over as private "hospitality venues" by national and state governments. Here they'll gorge themselves on ethnic dishes -- of which ground- up snouts and sphincters will be the wurst -- and sing patriotic drinking songs.</p>
<p>They might glance occasionally at the skaters and skiers on the giant TV screens provided, or they might not. Some of these swells who have "won" tickets to the events may even show up at the venues.</p>
<p>Other folks, though, don't expect to have a good time. And some are vowing to spoil it for those who do.</p>
<p>It's a bit strange that a manual designed originally for people demonstrating against the Vietnam War in 1968 has been updated as a guide for those who want to vent their spleen against the Games today.</p>
<p>People 40 years ago were protesting war and the waste of human life. Today, many are upset with the social distortion and fiscal profligacy that the coming Games are causing. Some Vancouver motorists seem to be objecting simply to the added inconvenience they'll face.</p>
<p>Still, our right to non-violent civil disobedience is a constitutional one and, as the author of the guide for anti-Olympic protesters, Vancouver lawyer Leo McGrady, has put it, we're seeing "the suspension of Charter rights for what is essentially a sporting event."</p>
<p>Vancouver has contracted to enforce an International Olympic Committee rule prohibiting any demonstration or "political, religious or racial propaganda ... in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas." McGrady says this is designed to prevent any demonstration visible to Olympic spectators or TV cameras.</p>
<p>And a combination of city bylaws impose what he says is "a very powerful ban on all traditional protest activities" -- signs, leaflets, congregations, chanting, megaphone use "or otherwise making loud noises" -- in 40 square blocks of downtown.</p>
<p>This week, with some 80 days before the Olympic machinery is put into gear, Vancouver councillors have scrapped one of those bylaws that human rights activists feared would send police on a rampage, destroying signs, tearing up banners and ripping off T-shirts offensive to the Olympics.</p>
<p>They've proposed a new bylaw applying only to commercial signs -- those deemed offensive to official sponsors, no doubt -- but that has yet to be drafted.</p>
<p>The guide warns bluntly that protesters committing an illegal act should expect to be arrested. It anticipates they are likely to encounter pepper spray, tear gas, Tasers and undercover cops or private security agents in masks egging them on as agents provocateurs.</p>
<p>It reports that the RCMP assistant commissioner in charge of security, Bud Mercer, "appeared to characterize all demonstrators as engaging in 'criminal protests' around the Olympics" when he appeared before Vancouver city council in July.</p>
<p>And watching how Mercer's troops comport themselves will be teams of busybodies in orange T-shirts with notebooks, cameras and tape machines, who have been taught in training camps to spot and record police abuses for legal action when all this is over.</p>
<p>We know that B.C.'s Office of the Police Complaints Commissioner can't investigate allegations of Mountie abuses. What about those against any of the municipal police seconded to the Games from other provinces? What if the soldiers or the private mercenaries run amok?</p>
<p>It's no fun cleaning up after a party. Especially after fisticuffs.</p>

</p>
<p>The University of the Fraser Valley Cascades put a tidal wave-sized scare into the Regina Cougars women's basketball team Friday at the Centre for Kinesiology, Health and Sport.</p>
<p>The Cougars, the No. 3-ranked team in the CIS, eventually came away with an 87-70 win, but as Regina head coach Dave Taylor noted, they "made it as hard as it could be."</p>
<p>"We just refuse as a team to do anything easy and it just drains us," said Taylor.</p>
<p>Playing with a bench just four players deep, the Cascades stayed with the Cougars until the last few minutes of the third quarter. After UFV guard Courtney Bartell hit a layup to pull the Cascades within one point at 58-57 with 1:36 left in the third, Regina went on a 20-3 run at the end of that quarter and the start of the fourth to pull away for good.</p>
<p>Joanna Zalesiak led Regina with 20 points and also grabbed 12 rebounds while Lindsay Ledingham added 19 points. Alyssa Gaukel and Tessa Hart each scored 16 for UFV.</p>
<p>The Cascades were playing their first game since Nov. 14.</p>
<p>They were forced to cancel contests last week because several of their players were either injured or dealing with H1N1-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"We're a young team and we're learning how to approach a game with energy and a little bit of grit and we've had some mixed results with that and we had some mixed results (Friday)," said UFV head coach Al Tuchscherer. "(Having four on the bench) was heaven compared to what it has been. We played Calgary and Lethbridge with only two people on the bench."</p>
<p>For most of the first three quarters, the Cougars had great difficulty hitting short lay-ups, but grabbed offensive rebound after offensive rebound.</p>
<p>Post Brittany Read finished the night 6-for-21 from the field and grabbed 13 offensive boards compared to just two on the defensive end.</p>
<p>"That's going to be in the back of my mind all night -- a coulda, shoulda, woulda thing," said Read, who was sporting a shiner under her right eye courtesy of a second-half elbow. "We didn't come out with energy at all the first bit which is weird because it's our home court and you'd think we'd want to."</p>
<p>Even more than the blown layups, Taylor wants to see his team find a way to fix those energy levels and increase its on-court emotion.</p>
<p>"We have to have better starts and we need to enjoy ourselves," said Taylor.</p>
<p>"They're playing on the No. 3 team in the country, in a city that loves its basketball, in a great facility. It couldn't be a much better scenario than that and we never look like we come out and are doing something we love doing. We just don't have that fire and that passion. At times that is good as a coach because you don't want to be up and down all the time, but we do have to be able to bring a little more excitement."</p>
<p>At 6-1, the Cougars wouldn't appear to be a team with major problems, but players, too, have noticed there is a fairly major fix to be made.</p>
<p>"We have some players who are very emotional and will go out of their way to talk and get people going and we have other players who are the complete opposite," said Ledingham. "We need to find that happy balance and get everyone talking and showing emotion on the court.</p>
<p>"In practice and warm-up, we have to start there because if we talk there, it will be a habit. Right now in our practice, talking is dead and warm-up is quiet."</p>
<p>The Cougars are back on the court at the CKHS tonight (6:15) against the Thompson Rivers Wolfpack.</p>
<p>- The Cougars men's hockey team fell 5-1 to the host Saskatchewan Huskies on Friday. Steven Gillen, Brennan Bosch, Jason Wagar, Brett Ward and Andrew Bailey scored for the Huskies (8-6-1) while Carter Smith had the lone goal for Regina (4-9-0). Brant Hilton made 19 saves on 23 shots for the Cougars before being pulled six minutes into the second period. Adam Ward made 15 saves in relief. Jeff Harvey made 28 saves for the Huskies, who play host to the Cougars again today.</p>
<p>- Scores from the Cougars men's basketball game against UFV and the women's hockey games against the UBC Thunderbirds were not available at press time.</p>

<p>Scientists here are working on a portable low-cost device that will quickly detect whether someone has -- or has had -- H1N1.</p>
<p>The researchers, who won a $5,000 local innovation award for their work last week, said the biochip sensor will allow a non-medical person to detect the flu virus in an hour for as little as $10 per test. Using current technology, such tests can cost a few hundred dollars each, they said.</p>
<p>The scientists also claim the portable device they are developing can be calibrated to detect antibodies indicating the onset of other infectious diseases including SARS, HIV and hepatitis B.</p>
<p>"This could be used in cancer detection," project leader Michael Zhang, a provincial biomedical engineer and an adjunct professor at the University of Winnipeg, said Thursday. "Someone could (conduct the test) at home or use it through their family physician's office."</p>
<p>Last week, Zhang and his colleagues won a local challenge event for innovators and entrepreneurs patterned on the model used in CBC's Dragon's Den, defeating four other teams. Other members of his group include U of W computer scientist Simon Liao, electrical engineer Bin Huang, and University of Manitoba biophysicist Francis Lin.</p>
<p>They will use the prize money and kick in some of their own to build a prototype of the hand-held device, which screens for specific diseases using a saliva test. After that, they'll need considerably more funding to conduct clinical trials to prove the device works before it is approved by agencies such as Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief public health officer, said such diagnostic devices have potential benefits, as long as they're used appropriately and are accurate.</p>
<p>"For a surveillance tool, this could be quite useful and, if it was accurate enough, might be useful for someone who has no symptoms to ask the question, 'Do I need to get a flu shot?"' Kettner said Thursday.</p>
<p>But it's a different situation if you're using it to make a medical decision on an individual who is ill, he said. "You don't want a test that gets it wrong half the time when it says you've got H1N1."</p>

</p>
<p>Researchers here will test to see whether smokers or children exposed to second-hand smoke are at an increased risk of becoming severely ill from H1N1.</p>
<p>Dr. Sat Sharma, director of respiratory labs at St. Boniface General Hospital, said Thursday that smoking is one potential H1N1 risk factor that hasn't been studied, and may give researchers another clue as to why H1N1 causes severe illness in some and relatively mild sickness in others.</p>
<p>Sharma is part of a team of Manitoba researchers who recently received a federal grant to study how H1N1 attacks the body differently than does seasonal influenza. While scientists know that certain risk factors -- among them pregnancy and aboriginal ancestry -- put people at a higher risk of severe illness from H1N1, they still do not know why.</p>
<p>Sharma said researchers will analyze cells from the blood and lungs of Manitobans hospitalized with severe H1N1 along with samples from people who experienced a mild bout of flu in the first or second flu wave.</p>
<p>The tests could allow scientist to tease out what protects some people against severe H1N1 and predisposes others to it.</p>
<p>"(Smoking) appears to be one factor not identified previously," Sharma said. "We'll be looking at that in a lot more detail."</p>
<p>The study began Oct. 1 and is part of a cross-country research project to learn more about how H1N1 attacks the lungs. Winnipeg scientists are collaborating with researchers in Toronto, Vancouver and Halifax to investigate how the virus works, along with what role genetics and environment play in how it infects the body.</p>
<p>Sharma and a group of Winnipeg researchers are leading the national effort, in part because of the large number of severe H1N1 cases that surfaced across the province earlier this spring.</p>
<p>The clusters of severe H1N1 cases among Manitoba First Nations caught the attention of the World Health Organization, and at its peak, 38 Manitobans were on ventilators in intensive care and seven people died.</p>
<p>Dr. Beni Sahai, senior scientist and virologist at Cadham Provincial Laboratory in Winnipeg, said it's crucial to learn more about the virus since H1N1 is quickly becoming the dominant flu strain. Old strains of influenza die off as new ones emerge, Sahai said, and H1N1 will soon replace the previous seasonal influenza strain.</p>
<p>While seasonal influenza is typically confined to the upper respiratory tract, Sahai said H1N1 progresses to the lower respiratory tract in the lungs and causes serious problems. Sahai said researchers need to understand why that is in order to figure out how to stop the progression of severe disease.</p>
<p>Scientists plan to follow patients for a year or longer to examine the long-term effects of H1N1 on the body.</p>
<p>"This one is here for good," Sahai said.</p>
<p>"The previous seasonal flu virus is rapidly being replaced by this virus."</p>
<p>So far, 12 H1N1 patients are enrolled in the Winnipeg study, including eight people who fell severely ill.</p>

</p>
<p>More than 1,000 deaths from the H1N1 swine flu virus were officially reported in the past week, a sharp rise which brings the global total to at least 7,826, the World Health Organization said on Friday.</p>
<p>More than half of the latest fatalities were reported by health authorities in the Americas region.</p>
<p>The winter flu season arrived early in the northern hemisphere this year and continues to be intense across parts of North America and much of Europe.</p>
<p>"In the United States and Canada, influenza transmission remains very active and geographically widespread," the WHO said, adding that the disease now appeared to have peaked in all U.S. regions.</p>
<p>"In Canada, influenza activity remains similar but (the) number of hospitalizations and deaths is increasing," it said.</p>
<p>It is too early to say whether there has yet been a peak in infections in the northern hemisphere, the WHO's top flu expert said on Thursday, and it will be some weeks before there is a downward trend in the numbers of those catching the virus.</p>
<p>The H1N1 pandemic virus is causing widespread and increasing infections in Europe, with many reporting a rapid rise.</p>
<p>Sweden, Norway, Moldova and Italy are reporting "very high activity" and health care services are reeling under the strain in Albania and Moldova, it said. Flu has peaked in other European countries including Belgium, Ireland and Serbia.</p>
<p>Flu transmission is active in East Asia and it remains "stably elevated" in Japan, but may be decreasing slightly in cities there, according to the United Nations health agency.</p>
<p>In temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, little pandemic flu activity has been reported.</p>

</p>
<p>(From The Edmonton Journal, November 29, 2009) In a story on B10 Friday, Alberta Auditor General Fred Dunn was misidentified. Fred Lindsay is the province's solicitor general. ***** </p>
<p>As MLAs wrapped up their work in the legislature Thursday, Premier Ed Stelmach acknowledged challenges the government faced during the fall session.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't say that I enjoyed it all, but when the tough get going sometimes you've got to dig a little deeper," he said.</p>
<p>The Stelmach government faced a series of bumps throughout the fall: plunging support in some public opinion polls;a fiscal picture that continues to be painted in red; and an H1N1 flu vaccination program plagued by long lineups across the province, public relations snafus and a potential shortage of immunization shots.</p>
<p>The four-week session saw MLAs pass new laws on election financing, firefighters' liability, and recovering the costs of health care from tobacco companies and convicted criminals.</p>
<p>But the month-long sitting was dominated primarily by discussion of Bill 50, the controversial Electric Statutes Amendment Act.</p>
<p>-Sept. 14: The former leader of the Wildrose Alliance, Paul Hinman, won the Calgary-Glenmore byelection. The riding was held by former deputy premier Ron Stevens until his spring retirement from politics. The Progressive Conservative candidate placed third in the race, behind the Liberals.</p>
<p>-Oct. 14:In a television address, Stelmach announced his four-point plan for getting Alberta out of red ink in the next three years.</p>
<p>-Oct. 17: Danielle Smith won the leadership of the fledgling Wildrose Alliance Party. "Ed Stelmach, you haven't even begun to imagine what's about to hit you," she said during her victory speech.</p>
<p>-Oct. 26: MLAs returned to the legislature for the second sitting of the 2009 session. Across the province, H1N1 flu vaccination clinics opened.</p>
<p>-By Nov. 5 the clinics were reorganized to deal with high-risk Albertans first. General immunization clinics reopened this week.</p>
<p>-Nov. 7:After months of speculation, Tory faithful gave Stelmach a 77-percent vote of approval.</p>
<p>-Nov. 18: Auditor General Fred Lindsay announced he would review Alberta's handling of the H1N1 flu vaccination program.</p>
<p>-Nov. 25:MLAs passed Bill 50, a new law to streamline the building of power transmission lines. For months, rural and urban Albertans criticized the law on a number of fronts, including a perceived limiting of future public consultation before transmission goes online, and for potentially causing a steep hike in electricity bills.</p>

</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK    </div>

<div>411 words</div><div>27 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>Canadian snowbirds who couldn't get their H1N1 shot before they headed south for the winter got it with ease when they arrived in Florida.</p>
<p>One of those snowbirds, Issie Caron, said he went to a public clinic in Montreal several weeks ago, but was denied the shot because he is 79 years old. For the first few weeks of immunization programs across Canada, the vaccine was offered only to people in high-priority groups, and senior citizens were not among them.</p>
<p>Now, clinics have opened to the general public in many places, but it was too late for Caron and others like him who had already left Canada for warmer climates.</p>
<p>"They wouldn't consider giving us our shots at all in Montreal," he said by phone from his winter home in Fort Lauderdale, where he spends four months a year.</p>
<p>Instead, he was given an information sheet with phone numbers and locations where he could get the vaccine in Florida, including at Walgreens drugstores for a $30 fee.</p>
<p>Soon after landing in Fort Lauderdale, Caron learned of an H1N1 clinic at the National Guard armoury near his home that was giving the shots to everyone, not just priority groups.</p>
<p>On the day Caron showed up last week, he waited in a short line and had no problem getting the shot.</p>
<p>"They gave it to anybody that had an American address. It was very nice of them," Caron said.</p>
<p>He did not have to show a health card, and the vaccine was free of charge.</p>
<p>"There was no hassle. It's not like it was in Montreal, where you had to wait an hour or two hours," Caron said. "I think it's beautiful."</p>
<p>A few days later, fellow snowbird friends arrived from Montreal; Caron drove them all to the clinic so they could get vaccinated as well.</p>
<p>Tim O'Connor, a spokesman for the Palm Beach County health unit, said there is no way to verify how many Canadians have received their vaccinations in south Florida.</p>
<p>One Fort Lauderdale resident quoted in the local newspaper wasn't too keen on Canadians taking up space in line and getting a vaccine that has been in short supply in some areas.</p>
<p>"Is this open to the world?" he said. "That's our vaccine that our taxpayers have paid for. They're not citizens."</p>

</p>
<p>T he RCMP-led security unit protecting the 2010 Winter Games is holding 750 police officers across Canada in reserve in case there's an H1N1 flu outbreak, other illnesses or a perceived security threat that requires their presence.</p>
<p>Assistant Commissioner Bud Mercer, the officer in charge of the Vancouver 2010 Integrated Security Unit, said Thursday the officers are in addition to more than 6,000 RCMP and police officers who will staff the Olympics starting Jan. 21.</p>
<p>"We have an additional 750 that . . . are pre-accredited, pre-screened, pre-approved, have their packages," he said. "That's part of our contingency planning in case any number of things happen, an increase in the threat level, H1N1, people start getting sick despite our best efforts around flu shots."</p>
<p>Most of those are "generalists" in the RCMP rather than specialists, the Integrated Security Unit said.</p>
<p>Mercer said the unit had also managed to reduce the overall number of security personnel needed for the Games.</p>
<p>"When we talked a year and a half ago, we said (6,600 to 6,800 officers)," he said after his address to the annual Emergency Preparedness Conference in Vancouver. "The numbers continued to come down as the planning matured. Do we need three people when one is enough?"</p>
<p>He said the Integrated Security Unit's sworn-officer contingent includes more than 1,700 officers from non-RCMP police departments across the country. In addition, the unit has 4,000 members of the Canadian Forces. Another 4,800 private security guards working for Contemporary Security Canada, a partnership formed to provide security for the Games, will operate screening services at venues.</p>
<p>Overall, the Integrated Security Unit will have 14,800 people working for it, he said.</p>
<p>The unit's portion of the $900-million Olympic security budget is just over $490 million, and he said he's hopeful some of that will be left over.</p>

<p>The father of a formerly healthy 16-year-old who is now on life support with H1N1 flu, wants people to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Kris Gorbous, whose son Michael has been in a medically induced coma for nearly one month, is concerned Canadians may become complacent.</p>
<p>Michael contracted H1N1 before the vaccine became available and is now on a ventilator, dialysis and a specialized device to introduce more oxygen into his blood.</p>
<p>He has pneumonia in both lungs and has lost 40 pounds.</p>
<p>"I hear a lot of people still questioning if they should get a shot or not. I bring up Michael's case right away," Gorbous said an interview from Foothills Hospital. "It's imperative that people get the shot."</p>
<p>Michael became ill Oct. 22.</p>
<p>For the first few days of his illness, he had a fever and other typical symptoms of influenza.</p>
<p>Although he had none of the risk factors that typically predispose patients to developing serious disease from the flu, he began experiencing chest pain by the sixth day of his illness.</p>
<p>His family called an ambulance, but paramedics told them his vitals were strong and he could remain at home.</p>
<p>By Nov. 2, however, his condition deteriorated and he was admitted to hospital.</p>
<p>His father said the "resilient" teen has made some slight improvements, but he does not yet know when his son will regain consciousness.</p>
<p>"We were told this week it could be a long haul. It's been pretty much a nightmare."</p>
