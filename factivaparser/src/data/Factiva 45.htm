</p>
<p>I was on a plane the other week and the teenage girl beside me kept coughing like a tubercular sailor. She had good illness etiquette and always coughed hygienically into her elbow -- but I found myself leaning so far into the aisle that the food trolley ran over my foot.</p>
<p>I'm just part of our increasingly antiseptic society where we squirm over germs and whine about swine -- er, make that H1N1 -- flu.</p>
<p>Some people think we face the greatest health crisis since the 1918 flu bug, while others think it's the greatest hype since the millennium bug but, whatever the case, you can see our microbe mania everywhere.</p>
<p>As kids return to class this week, those unhealthy candy bar dispensers may be gone, but they've been replaced by soap dispensers: sanitary soap to keep germs at bay, in case your lunchmate breathes on your brie.</p>
<p>Many schools have sent out parental warnings that no coughing will be tolerated. Anyone sneezy, sniffly, drippy or grippy will be quarantined like a bio-terrorist and sent home in a germ-proof vehicle -- then charged with assault with a deadly cough.</p>
<p>Sneeze twice because you have fall allergies and your whole classroom will empty out as kids flee in terror and announcements are made on the school intercom: "Suspected flu case in Room 313. Third floor is now sealed off. Everyone else clear the building!"</p>
<p>Yet school is only part of the paranoia rattling our germ-jittery society. Hospital-style hand sanitizers are popping up in newsrooms, government buildings, shopping malls, offices -- and probably soon in elevators. We are now expected to wash our hands more often than Lady Macbeth.</p>
<p>Germophobia is everywhere. Many people now flush restaurant toilets with their feet, elbows or wrists, while others always push elevator buttons with a pen or their car key.</p>
<p>In a fancy Washington museum last week, there were Kleenex dispensers at the bathroom entrance, with instructions to use them to touch all faucets and doors. We may soon have to encase ourselves in protective plastic.</p>
<p>We are turning into a cult of clean freaks. Thirty years ago, we laughed at Howard Hughes, a bizarre billionaire who was so terrified of germs he wouldn't shake anyone's hands or touch a doorknob. Yet today we are all Howard Hughes. We live in a time when everyone is obsessed with their health, although we've never been healthier.</p>
<p>Much of the problem is that we have too much information. Back in the 20th century, our mothers told us that the flu was caught by going outside with wet hair, or not listening to your mother. But now, because of science, we know that disease is caused by a billion jumpy germs leaping eagerly from hand to hand.</p>
<p>What next, as we avoid any place we can accidentally share germs with swinish strangers? What about buses, where we all grip the same germ-infested poles? Or ATM machines, where a million fingers touch the same 10 keys? How long before we wear disposable plastic gloves at the gas pump or use antibacterial sprays at every bank machine?</p>
<p>What about the filthy money we exchange constantly, saying: "Here -- have some germs with your change?"</p>
<p>And how long will we continue to jam our germy hands into a communal box of popcorn -- before each kernel comes individually wrapped?</p>
<p>Then there are sports, where we share our germs on every basketball, volleyball, baseball and football. Soon the quarterback will throw the ball but no one will want to catch ... his cold.</p>
<p>Then there's the really dangerous stuff: intimacy. In today's germ-jangled world, how long can the handshake last before it's replaced by a safer form of greeting -- like bowing or waving? Many schools are now teaching kids to do the elbow bump, instead of the high five or the two-cheek kiss.</p>
<p>As fear spreads, will the now popular bear hug be replaced by the air hug?</p>
<p>And how about -- ugh ... kissing? How long can such a disgusting activity continue before "consenting kissers" are required to exchange papers proving they've each had a checkup in the past 24 hours -- and their lips are clean?</p>
<p>Or before school pamphlets say: "Kissing Kills"?</p>
<p>We may be at the dawn of a new non-contact society. We already spend much of our time online with virtual friends, having electronic chats instead of real ones and texting instead of touching people. Could germs and swine flu be the final push that scares us away from other humans?</p>
<p>We are switching over to hands-free phones, while hands-free doors, toilets and elevator buttons can't be far behind.</p>
<p>Get ready for a hands-free world.</p>

<p>A new, furry -- and yes, cuddly -- weapon has been added to the flu-fighting arsenal in the U.S.</p>
<p>The Obama administration unveiled on Tuesday a public health ad campaign featuring Sesame Street muppet, Elmo, encouraging proper hygiene habits as a way to combat the virus.</p>
<p>The four ads tell children, who are among the most vulnerable to H1N1 infection, to "keep happy and healthy on Sesame Street" by regularly washing their hands, avoiding rubbing their eyes, mouth and nose and sneezing into their arms.</p>

<p>Re: 'Sick with worry: Experts don't know how bad H1N1 will be; it could kill thousands, or fizzle in the fall' (Aug. 29)</p>
<p>Does "Better safe than sorry" apply more to joining the mass inoculation being planned against the H1N1 virus, or choosing not to because of dangers in doing so?</p>
<p>At latest report, 72 deaths have been attributed to this flu -- a small number when compared with the little-broadcast fact that flu results in an average of 20,000 hospitalizations and 4,000 deaths each year.</p>
<p>The federal government's purchase of 50.4 million doses of vaccine from GlaxoSmith Kline Plc is a concern. Adjuvant (additional) ingredients have had harmful effects in the past. Glaxo says its adjuvant has proven safe and effective in clinical trials with 39,000 people; the additive isn't yet approved in the U.S.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer says clinical trials for the vaccine are on track for early this fall. His aim is to ensure "safety and effectiveness," but these are always value judgments.</p>
<p>Unlike previous destructive experiences with governments' pandemic panic reactions, this time all potential dangers must be clearly laid before the public.</p>
<p>Advertising must be of the positive steps that can be taken in everyday living to avoid catching all influenzas and transmitting them to others, rather than scare tactics that have been used in the past. Positive steps can be taken immediately in hospitals and schools to make alcohol-based sanitizer (gel or wipes) not only available, as has been done in hospitals, but also mandatory upon entering.</p>
<p>Which risk is the greater, catching this flu or suffering debilitating effects from a hurriedly prepared vaccine?</p>
<p>Governments must be pressed to provide all data available so individuals can make informed decisions for themselves and their families.</p>

<p>As if the job weren't difficult enough, being a Latin American president suddenly has become more perilous.</p>
<p>Colombian President Alvaro Uribe has come down with swine flu--he was recuperating at home on Tuesday in Bogota--becoming the second Latin American president, after Costa Rica's Oscar Arias, to be victimized by the virus in less than a month.</p>
<p>Now at least six other Latin American presidents who met Friday with Uribe, the day he began to suffer from the flu's telltale signs, are being watched for symptoms. One of those, Evo Morales of Bolivia, said he was taking the flu-fighting drug Tamiflu in hopes of warding off the illness.</p>
<p>The infection rate for Latin American presidents so far is more than 10 times the global average of less than one per cent. However, the significance of two falling ill from the virus is more than just a statistical oddity, flu experts said. It's a reminder that everyday activities put everyone at risk of coming into contact with the virus.</p>
<p>"Presidents shake a lot of hands," said Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization. "The more people you come into contact with, the greater chance you'll contract the virus."</p>
<p>"Disease knows no boundary and respects no rank," said Daniel Epstein, the Pan American Health Organization's spokesman. "The best prevention--besides taking medicines when they become available-- is an emphasis on personal hygiene, especially cleaning hands with soap and water. This goes for everybody, including presidents."</p>
<p>Latin America has the highest infection rate for swine flu in the world, with Brazil, Argentina and Chile among the leaders in flu incidence, according to the World Health Organization. That's no surprise, experts said. It's flu season in the Southern Hemisphere, where it's winter, and in tropical Northern Hemisphere countries such as Costa Rica and Colombia, where it's the rainy season.</p>
<p>Cases should start dropping in those areas as winter ends and should pick up in the United States in the next month or two, when the flu season begins to take hold there.</p>
<p>Worldwide, the World Health Organization reports, at least 209,438 people had been infected as of Aug. 23 since the first cases were reported in May in Mexico and San Diego.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Rabbit roundup considered for University of Victoria; Droppings pose health risk for students, children and athletes</b>

</p>
<p>A rabbit roundup could be the next step in the University of Victoria's quest to control its burgeoning bunny population.</p>
<p>University officials are seeking proposals for a pilot project to trap and sterilize 150 rabbits, and then offer them up for adoption.</p>
<p>"I'm concerned. It's literally a year this week that we launched our public-awareness campaign," said Richard Piskor, the university's director of occupational health, safety and environment. "We tried a very strong media blitz -- don't abandon, don't feed, don't harass -- and a year on what we're seeing is that there are more rabbits than before.</p>
<p>"We're seeing that there still is feeding going on. The more they feed, the more they procreate and the more rabbits you get, so what's happened is they're being driven up to an unsustainable level."</p>
<p>The overall rabbit population varies, so estimates are difficult to make, Piskor said.</p>
<p>"But if someone were to say over 1,000, that wouldn't surprise me."</p>
<p>Piskor said the bunnies can compromise students' health.</p>
<p>"They can carry any and all kinds of things, whether it be parasites, or viral or bacterial disease. We've got such a strong hand-washing campaign going on with H1N1 [flu prevention], but I see people taking their little kids to campus and feeding the bunnies and trying to pet them. It just isn't the way to go."</p>
<p>Piskor is particularly concerned about the school playing fields.</p>
<p>"We've got a fairly significant load of feces on those fields, and we've got athletes who may have cuts or abrasions or whatever else," Piskor said. "They're getting that material into those cuts. It's unnecessarily raising risks for them."</p>
<p>He said rabbit bites are another continuing problem.</p>
<p>"If somebody gets bitten, they need to seek medical attention, they may need stitches, they need a tetanus shot."</p>
<p>Piskor said euthanizing the rabbits will be considered as a last resort.</p>

<p>Manitoba's battered pork industry is bracing for another blow as the province's chief veterinary officer has confirmed that the H1N1 flu virus has spread to several hog herds.</p>
<p>Dr. Wayne Lees said the virus was first detected at the end of June. He said the virus was spread to hogs by human contact with the animals. That's something that will likely continue as the virus spreads among people, many of whom don't realize they're sick.</p>
<p>"It hasn't shown any evidence to date that would cause me to be unduly concerned," Lees said. "Pigs will run a bit of a runny nose for a while. They'll cough for a while. And then they'll recover. That's exactly the pattern that we've seen."</p>

<p>Canada is not moving too slowly on the production and approval of the H1N1 flu vaccine, the country's chief public-health officer said Tuesday in response to renewed questions about whether the vaccine will be rolled out in time to protect Canadians from a second wave of the ongoing pandemic.</p>
<p>"There isn't actually any delay," said Dr. David Butler-Jones, who went on to explain Canada's decision to order a vaccine with an adjuvant, an additive that can help generate a stronger immune response to the vaccine, often making it possible to reduce the size of the vaccine dose or the number of doses needed.</p>
<p>"That means more vaccine for the rest of the world," said Butler-Jones at a news conference. "Rather than hogging all of that material, it provides it for the rest of the world."</p>
<p>BOOST TO EFFECTIVENESS</p>
<p>Previous clinical trials on a bird-flu virus showed that vaccines with an adjuvant were more effective, he added, and they can provide for "drift" if the virus changes slightly.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones was responding to an editorial that appeared Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal that suggested the federal government's decision to use a vaccine with an adjuvant is slowing down the regulatory approval process. It called for a non-adjuvanted vaccine to be approved first so that high-risk groups can be vaccinated sooner than mid-November, when Canada's order is expected to be ready.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones, however, said ordering a vaccine with or without an adjuvant makes no difference to Canada's timeline to start immunizing people in mid-November.</p>
<p>"The goal in Canada is to ensure as much vaccine as possible, as early as possible. At the same time, it must be both safe and considered effective," he said. "Only in retrospect will the various plans be judged, but we are moving as safely as we reasonably can."</p>
<p>Canada has ordered 50 million doses of the vaccine from Glaxo-SmithKline that are being produced at the company's Ste-Foy, Que., plant. The results of clinical trials, which have yet to begin in Canada but have started in other countries, are to determine how many doses of vaccine are needed and how potent to make them. Butler-Jones said the clinical trial process normally lasts months for a new vaccine, but it will be sped up in this case.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones and Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, who held the conference to announce details of $400 million in spending for First Nations and Inuit health services, emphasized that there will be enough vaccine for every Canadian who wants the shot.</p>
<p>While a formal list of who will get the vaccine first hasn't been finalized, Butler-Jones said pregnant women and other people at risk, including those with chronic diseases, will be among the first. Vaccinating all people in remote communities will also be a priority, he said.</p>
<p>The opposition parties have been critical of the federal government's handling of the pandemic, particularly in remote First Nations communities, and accuse the Conservatives of dragging their feet on pandemic planning over the summer.</p>
<p>But the health minister rejects claims that Canada isn't ready to face a more widespread pandemic during the fall and winter flu season.</p>
<p>"We are well-positioned. We are seen as world leaders in the response to a pandemic and we've been sharing our models with the international community," she said.</p>
<p>International experts will be among those in the audience Wednesday when Aglukkaq and Butler-Jones provide the opening remarks of a two-day conference being held in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>The conference is bringing together more than 200 intensive-care specialists, public-health experts and front line health-care workers. A representative from the World Health Organization will provide an overview of the global pandemic and much of the focus over the two days will be on preventing and managing severe cases of swine flu.</p>
<p>Canada's vaccine strategy, criticized by the Canadian Medical Association Journal, will also be a topic of discussion.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Plummer, chief science adviser to the Public Health Agency of Canada and head of Winnipeg's National Microbiology Laboratory, said patients who have contracted serious cases of swine flu have been complicated to treat and intensive-care units need help to prepare for a possible surge in the number of cases.</p>
<p>"What we've been hearing, from intensive care practitioners across the country and around the world, is that management of any of these patients is extremely difficult and unusual," he said.</p>
<p>So far the swine flu has been linked to the death of at least 72 Canadians but the majority of Canadians who have gotten ill have experienced mild cases.</p>

<p>The White House on Tuesday added a new, furry--and yes, cuddly --weapon to its flu-fighting arsenal as the United States prepares to combat a resurgence of the H1N1 virus this fall, the Sesame Street muppet Elmo.</p>
<p>A week after a group of White House advisers predicted up to 90,000 Americans could die this flu season from the new strain of flu, the Obama administration unveiled a public-health ad campaign featuring the cheery children's television character encouraging proper hygiene habits as a way to combat the virus.</p>
<p>The four ads tell children, who are among the most vulnerable to H1N1 infection, to "Keep happy and healthy on Sesame Street" by regularly washing their hands, avoiding rubbing their eyes, mouth and nose and sneezing into their arms.</p>
<p>"Younger children and their parents are some of the people most at risk from the new H1N1 flu virus and with schools starting back up again and the weather starting to get colder, we need to do everything we can to get these important messages about how to prevent the spread of the flu out there," said U. S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.</p>
<p>The unveiling of the Elmo ad campaign came as senior administration officials briefed President Barack Obama on the status of the U. S. government's pandemic preparations.</p>
<p>The White House sparked a wave of renewed concern--and some criticism-- about the potential impact of the swine flu when the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology issued an Aug. 24 report that included a "plausible scenario" in which half the U. S. population could be infected by the virus.</p>
<p>It said the second wave of the H1N1 virus could see up to 1.8 million Americans hospitalized and 30,000 to 90,000 die, with infections peaking in mid-October just as a vaccine for the flu is expected to be ready.</p>
<p>Speaking briefly to reporters on Tuesday following his briefing on the flu, Obama said the virus "is still somewhat unpredictable" and its impact could be mitigated by common sense precautions.</p>
<p>"I don't want anybody to be alarmed, but I do want everyone to be prepared," Obama said. "We expect a flu shot will begin soon. This program will be completely voluntary, but it will be strongly recommended."</p>
<p>In a separate development, the National Institutes of Health reported the preliminary findings of a new U. S. study conducted on ferrets that shows the H1N1 virus to be "more communicable" than other viruses.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by University of Maryland researchers, also found the H1N1 virus out-competed two seasonal human-flu viruses and became more dominant when uninfected ferrets were infected with the different strains.</p>
<p>"The H1N1 pandemic virus has a clear biological advantage over the two main seasonal flu strains and all the makings of a virus fully adapted to humans," said Dr. Daniel Perez, the study's lead researcher.</p>
<p>But the study also found no evidence to suggest the H1N1 virus had combined, or mutated, with other viruses to form a superbug-one of the biggest fears scientists have had about the swine flu's possible evolution.</p>
<p>"These findings suggest that while 2009 H1N1 virus probably will predominate in the coming flu season, there may not be biological pressure for the new virus to recombine with other circulating viruses, the researchers say," the NIH said in a statement.</p>
<p>Because the study found that ferrets infected with the H1N1 and seasonal flu developed more severe illness, the NIH said the results underscore the importance of vaccinating against both types of flu this fall and winter.</p>

</div><div>Murray Allen   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>

</p>
<p>There has been an abundance of hysteria in the news about swine flu, but little has been heard from the common medical practitioner.</p>
<p>As walk-in practitioners, we are the first line defence against the flu. The emergency departments are full and getting an appointment with the family doc on short notice is impossible.</p>
<p>What have we been seeing during Phase I of this pandemic? At a time when all the seasonal flus have ran their winter course, we saw a brand new flu complex. Along with the usual headaches, general aches, fatigue, sort-of sore throat and cough, we saw some short-lasting nausea -- vomiting with diarrhea. Early in the spring, when the health authorities had identified eight cases of swine flu in B.C., I was seeing up to 10 cases of this different off-seasonal flu per day.</p>
<p>So far, all the cases I have seen -- several hundred, by now -- were so mild that most patients didn't realize it was the flu. Most also indicated they had many friends with the same sort of symptoms, but none had bothered to visit a doctor. If all these cases were swine flu (and it seems reasonable, since H1N1 was the only game in town at the time), there were several hundred times more cases than the authorities recognized.</p>
<p>Another point of interest: This flu was rampaging through B.C. at a hot time in the spring. We haven't seen that before. Only in the last few weeks have we seen a drop in walk-in flu cases. This could mean either the flu has been fading in the hot summer or there is a high population-saturation of immunity and, therefore, the virus is having a hard time finding susceptible victims. Nowhere have I read about current levels of community immunity to H1N1, yet this is a critical piece of information when planning a defence against any pandemic-type illness. It is possible we are past the pandemic and that all the current political posturing and pandemic preparation are mere hysteria.</p>

<p>HIGHLIGHTS</p>
<p>6% increase in MSP premiums</p>
<p>Up to $72 reduction in personal income tax</p>
<p>$347 million more to fight forest fires</p>
<p>$151 million over 2 years for full-day kindergarten</p>
<p>$80 million for H1N1 prevention</p>
<p>0% Small business tax to be eliminated by 2012</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>In a budget update intended to boost economic recovery, Finance Minister Colin Hansen offered modest tax cuts on Tuesday, but told British Columbians they will have to pay higher MSP premiums and live with fewer non-essential programs.</p>
<p>The update came weeks after the government announced it would introduce a harmonized sales tax, which finance officials now estimate will cost individuals an average of about $280 more each year before taking into account tax reductions.</p>
<p>Hansen projected a record $2.8-billion deficit for the current fiscal year, more than five times his forecast in February.</p>
<p>The highest deficit had been $2.6 billion, brought in by the Liberal government in 2002-03.</p>
<p>Hansen forecast the economy will shrink by 2.9 per cent this year, but increase by 1.9 per cent in 2010.</p>
<p>Both Hansen and Premier Gordon Campbell said the inflated deficit was necessary because plunging revenues and increased costs would otherwise take a massive bite out of spending on health care and education.</p>
<p>"This budget is all about protecting vital services and laying the foundation for economic recovery," Hansen said, pointing out that spending on health will increase 18 per cent over the next three years.</p>
<p>"Just about everyone was caught off-guard by the speed, scope and depth of the economic downturn," he said. Government revenues have fallen $2 billion since the February budget.</p>
<p>He projected combined deficits of $5.6 billion over the next four years before the budget returns to the black in 2013-14.</p>
<p>Hansen said the combined deficits could have been as high as $7.2 billion without the money Ottawa is handing over as an incentive to implement the HST, $750 million of which he is using to keep this year's deficit down.</p>
<p>Over the next three years, government spending will increase by $3.5 billion, which Hansen said covers inflation and population increases, not new spending.</p>
<p>At the same time, the government says it will cut $3.4 billion in spending on administration, private contractors and discretionary programs.</p>
<p>Among the most significant cuts this year is a $354-million clawback of discretionary government grants.</p>
<p>Hansen did not list grants that were reduced or eliminated, claiming they had never been officially committed. "I can't come up with a list of things we might have approved," he said.</p>
<p>Hansen announced annual MSP premiums increases starting next year, which he said were "necessary to keep health spending sustainable."</p>
<p>Spending on health care is to increase by about $2.4 billion from last year through 2011-12, when health care will represent more than 50 per cent of spending across all ministries.</p>
<p>Next year's MSP increase will be about six per cent, Hansen said, and will track with health-spending increases thereafter. That likely means MSP premiums will rise by about 18 per cent over the next three years.</p>
<p>Next year's increase is expected to cost an individual about $36, and families about $72.</p>
<p>To offset the MSP hikes, Hansen said low-income support for premiums will be improved. Individuals making less than $22,000 will now pay no premiums, while those making less than $30,000 will pay up to $100 less than they do now.</p>
<p>Reaction to the budget was mixed.</p>
<p>"This is a budget that is built on fiscal incompetence and deceit," said New Democratic Party leader Carole James, adding that it breaks several promises made by Campbell during the last election campaign.</p>
<p>"This is a budget that is going to hurt middle-class British Columbians and make their life more difficult," she said, pointing to the HST and higher MSP premiums.</p>
<p>"I'm deeply disappointed and angry," said Jim Sinclair, president of the B.C. Federation of Labour. "There's nothing in here that means [Hansen] understands that people are in a crisis."</p>
<p>Business leaders were positive, saying the budget addressed economic realities.</p>
<p>"There's a very solid foundation being built for growth," said John Winter of the B.C. Chamber of Commerce, who thought the government had struck an appropriate balance.</p>
<p>Brian Bonney of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business said: "Small businesses were looking for a clear sign that government was still doing things to help restore their confidence.</p>
<p>"They wanted to be able to see a sign that said they should go back out and invest in British Columbia," and that was exactly what he saw in the budget, he said.</p>
<p>Bonney was happy with an increase in the small-business tax threshold -- the minimum amount of taxable income to which the small-business corporate income tax rate may be applied -- to $500,000 from $400,000. He said that would save businesses about $20 million per year.</p>
<p>Personal taxes will also be reduced, which Hansen said will help offset the HST.</p>
<p>Starting next year, the personal provincial tax credit will increase by $1,627 to $11,000, saving an individual about $72 per year.</p>
<p>The government said it will provide an HST rebate on residential energy costs, matching current exemptions on the PST.</p>
<p>For the first time, the government estimated how the HST will affect individual consumers.</p>
<p>On average, it said individuals will pay about $280 more per year before the new tax cuts, and about $23 more once the tax cuts and HST credits are included.</p>
<p>Campbell said he would like to have avoided deep deficits, but called the budget update a "prudent plan" to help the province return to balanced budgets.</p>
<p>"It's going to take a lot of work and a lot of discipline for us to get back to balance," he said.</p>
<p>"Having said that, the steps we've taken today, I believe, are going to strengthen our economy, are going to strengthen investment, are going to encourage job growth ... and our economy is going to come out of this even stronger."</p>

<p>President Evo Morales reassured Bolivians on Tuesday about the state of his health, insisting that he has no symptoms of swine flu, despite having received treatment for the virus.</p>
<p>"I had a checkup and they told me that I don't have anything, and I don't feel" any symptoms, the Bolivian leader said, adding that he regretted that a government health official divulged that he had received "preventive treatment" for the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Health officials revealed that Morales started receiving "preventive treatment" for swine flu after attending a regional summit last month at which Colombia's president became infected by the virus, officials said.</p>
<p>"A preventive treatment of a prophylactic type, using Tamiflu, the medication recommended for the A(H1N1) flu, has been started," Eddy Martinez, the director of a national epidemiological centre, told the official ABI news agency, adding that the treatment would last 10 days.</p>
<p>Morales met last week with Colombia's President Alvaro Uribe at the regional summit in Bariloche, Argentina, where the Colombian leader fell ill. Uribe is the second Latin American president to come down with the flu.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Less than half of Canadians</p>
<p>plan to get H1N1 vaccination</p>
<p>A new poll suggests Canadians are divided on whether to get a H1N1 shot when the vaccine becomes available later in the fall. The Canadian Press Harris-Decima poll indicates only 45 per cent of Canadians plan to get vaccinated against the pandemic virus. That figure is only slightly more than the percentage of respondents who say they get annual flu shots, 39 per cent. And the poll findings suggest parents may have concerns about adjuvants, a compound that boosts the immune response to a vaccination. Fifty-six per cent of respondents say they'll get their children vaccinated against H1N1. But when asked if they will vaccinate their children if the shot contains adjuvant, only 35 per cent say they'll do so.</p>

<p>Sunrise Propane charged by environment ministry for blast</p>
<p>Ontario's Environment Ministry has laid charges against Sunrise Propane a year after an explosion at its Toronto facility. The massive blasts claimed two lives and forced the evacuation of thousands of people. Sunrise Propane and directors Shay Ben-Moshe and Valery Belahov face seven charges under the Environmental Protection Act. All of the charges are related to failing to comply with requirements of a provincial order such as carrying out cleanup work. Ben-Moshe and Belahov have also been charged with failing to take all reasonable care to prevent the corporation from contravening a provincial order</p>

<p>Toddler in critical condition</p>
<p>after alleged attack by woman</p>
<p>A baby is in hospital after what witnesses describe as a brutal attack in which the child's face was smashed into cement. Pearl Bilsborrow says her son, Tyler, saw what he initially thought was a woman beating up a cat near their home in Winnipeg. Bilsborrow says the woman fled when the 18-year-old approached to see what was going on and found a baby in a pool of blood. Winnipeg officials will only confirm that a young child was taken to hospital in critical condition and the child abuse unit is investigating.</p>
<p>HALIFAX</p>
<p>Dutch woman arrested at Halifax airport with bundles of drugs</p>
<p>A 27-year-old woman from the Netherlands will appear in a Nova Scotia court on drug trafficking charges. RCMP say the Canada Border Services agency arrested a woman at Halifax Stanfield International Airport on Sunday after discovering 15.7 kilograms of khat inside two suitcases. Zulaika Antonette Felix has been charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking and importation. Khat is the green leaf of a plant native to east Africa that produces a stimulant effect similar to an amphetamine when ingested.</p>

<p>Drunk driving charges dropped for Sobey family member</p>
<p>Drunk driving charges against the president and chief executive officer of <span class="companylink">Lawtons Drug Stores Ltd</span>. were withdrawn in provincial court Monday. Robert George Creighton Sobey, 42, of Stellarton, N.S., is a member of the prominent Sobey family and a director of <span class="companylink">Empire Co. Ltd</span>., the holding company that owns <span class="companylink">Sobeys Inc</span>. Sobey was charged in Stellarton on July 18 with driving under the influence of alcohol and failing the breathalyzer. Crown attorney Bill Gorman says after a review of the evidence, it was found there was no prospect of conviction.</p>

<p>Man who faked abduction</p>
<p>gets break-and-enter charges</p>
<p>A Toronto man accused of faking his own abduction last week has landed in more legal trouble. Furqan Muhammad-Haroon is charged with two counts of break-and-enter at a software company where he worked in late 2007. Muhammad-Haroon was released with restrictions he must stay at home except for visits to doctors, lawyers or school. The electrical engineering student is also charged with theft under $5,000 over computer equipment allegedly stolen from IBM, another former employer. He was found Aug. 25 near a St. Catharines, Ont., mosque after he had phoned a friend days earlier saying he was being abducted at gunpoint.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Roman Catholic churches in Guelph are changing some rituals to help stem the spread of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Father Dennis Noon said Monday he received a directive from the Hamilton diocese a month ago asking priests to stop shaking hands and taking communion from a communal cup.</p>
<p>"We have to consider safety," Noon said. "Some people have expressed concerns, but by and large the congregation has been accepting."</p>
<p>Noon said members of the congregation are opting to nod, bow or wave to those near them during the traditional peace offering part of the service, where people would normally shake hands.</p>
<p>Those who give communion will sanitize their hands before and after, he said, and the communal cup has been retired.</p>
<p>"Nothing is lost in the service," Noon said. "Years ago we didn't use the cup. I'm sure this will be lifted after awhile."</p>
<p>Local hospitals, schools, churches and other institutions are bringing in new hygiene practices in light of H1N1 .</p>
<p>Jan Craig, spokesperson for Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health, said her agency is preparing guidelines for faith groups, as it has for health care workers and other institutions.</p>
<p>"These are guidelines only," Craig said. "There's no policy or enforcement. We need organizations to brainstorm around the guidelines to figure out ways they can keep the virus from spreading."</p>
<p>Craig said public health is championing six general practices for people to use in the coming influenza season.</p>
<p>While H1N1 is different from the seasonal flu, both are respiratory viruses that spread through droplets in the air. So the way to avoid all respiratory viruses - even colds - is the same.</p>
<p>• Keep your distance from coughers - at least two metres.</p>
<p>• Cough or sneeze into your elbow and not your hands. Viruses live longer on hard surfaces as opposed to fabric, so droplets on a sleeve are less likely to be transferred.</p>
<p>• Wash your hands - often - and use hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>• Stay home if you're sick. That means home from the grocery store as well as work or school. And don't have visitors if you're sick either.</p>
<p>• Get your vaccination.</p>
<p>• Clean and disinfect often-touched items, such as doorknobs, computer keyboards, telephones and hand rails.</p>
<p>"We have a shared responsibility to control it," Craig said, adding school boards will send information home to parents this week, and the University of Guelph is stepping up its cleaning practices.</p>
<p>"The biggest thing is to stay home when you're sick."</p>
<p>The guidelines are especially important for anyone under 20. "Unlike the seasonal flu, younger people are affected by H1N1," Craig said.</p>
<p>Craig said public health will hold immunization clinics for seasonal flu in October and for H1N1 in November. More details are available at www.wdghu.org[http://www.wdghu.org].</p>

</p>
<p>VICTORIA -- After seven years of unchanged fees for provincial health-care coverage, British Columbians will in January begin paying about 6 per cent more for Medical Services Plan premiums.</p>
<p>And whether it comes out of B.C. residents' pockets or those of their employers, that hike won't be the last, as the province yesterday unveiled plans to increase premiums every year in line with health-care spending.</p>
<p>The decision, announced by Finance Minister Colin Hansen in Victoria as part of yesterday's provincial budget, triggered an outcry from health unions and other critics who said the MSP hike would put another financial burden on consumers already bracing for the harmonized sales tax.</p>
<p>Health authorities, already scrambling to balance their budgets, will now have the added challenge of absorbing increased MSP premiums, said Judy Darcy, a spokeswoman for the Hospital Employees' Union.</p>
<p>“That's a big hit,” Ms. Darcy said. “For public-sector employers, for private-sector employers and for individuals who are paying their own premiums for themselves and their families.”</p>
<p>The province went to extraordinary lengths to protect health care and services in the face of unprecedented, tough economic conditions, Mr. Hansen said yesterday.</p>
<p>But the belt-tightening is already hurting, critics say.</p>
<p>“We know that on the front lines, we are losing jobs, and we are losing services,” Debra McPherson, president of the British Columbia Nurses' Union, said yesterday in Victoria. “We are losing services for frail seniors that would allow them to stay longer in their homes. We are losing public health nurses on the eve of an H1N1 epidemic and mass immunization drive.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hansen yesterday outlined plans to increase health-care spending in each of the next three years by about 6 per cent a year, while boosting Medical Service Premiums by 6 per cent to help offset spiralling health budgets.</p>
<p>By 2011-2012, health-care funding is expected to hit $15.7-billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Hansen insisted that the plan would protect vital services and emphasized that the government was taking steps to protect low-income people from the MSP hike.</p>
<p>Next year's hike will amount to a maximum of $3 a month for single people, or $6 per family, budget documents said. MSP premiums will be eliminated or reduced for about 180,000 people as part of the program.</p>
<p>“When people fall on hard times, we provide support for them,” Mr. Hansen said in his budget speech. “And these are absolutes; they are not negotiable.”</p>
<p>As of January 1, MSP premiums – unchanged in B.C. since 2002 – will increase by about 6 per cent to “help keep health-care funding sustainable.”</p>
<p>Health-care costs have climbed by 45 per cent since 2002, budget documents state. And the province “intends to increase premiums annually by the percentage increase in health-care spending.”</p>
<p>The province now hopes to keep increases to the 6 per cent a year range.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the provincial government told health authorities that it would not provide more money to bridge a projected $360-million collective shortfall, resulting in sweeping reviews as the health authorities looked for ways to balance their budgets.</p>
<p>So far, the authorities have taken steps that include hiring freezes, restrictions on overtime and cutbacks in elective surgeries.</p>
<p>Other measures are being contemplated, and some of them could affect the most vulnerable of B.C. residents, including aboriginal children and families, said Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, child and youth advocate for British Columbia.</p>
<p>Ms. Turpel-Lafond said outreach programs for young mothers, mental health and other services would likely be affected as health authorities try to find ways to balance their budgets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, B.C.'s child poverty rate remains the worst in the country, she said.</p>
<p>“They may say it's an absolute, but I can't see where the dollars follow the commitment,” she said.</p>
<p>An aging, growing population could threaten the government's attempts to restrict increases in health-care spending. Among major risks to the fiscal plan include “utilization rates” for services such as health care.</p>
<p>The budget also includes $80-million for H1N1 programs.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hard-times B.C. budget predicts years of red ink; Amid plunging revenue, 'disappointed' Liberals forecast a record deficit</b>
</div><div>Dirk Meissner   </div>
<div>THE CANADIAN PRESS</div>
<div>622 words</div><div>2 September 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>VICTORIA -- The B.C. government, saying the province is facing the greatest economic crisis in a generation, tabled a budget yesterday that forecasts a deficit almost six times higher than it anticipated earlier this year. It also increases personal health insurance premiums and reveals a drastically shrinking economy.</p>
<p>The slide into hard times has been fast and deep, said Finance Minister Colin Hansen, who saw expected government revenues - taxes and energy resources - decline by $2 billion.</p>
<p>It also marks a return to the cost-cutting budgets the Liberals delivered after they were first elected in 2001. But while voters gave the party an overwhelming mandate for change then, there was little indication things would be so dire before the latest provincial election this past May.</p>
<p>This budget is almost a complete revision of February's, which barely hinted at the depth of the economic ills facing British Columbia.</p>
<p>Then, the deficit was forecast at $495 million, but now the government predicts it will be a record $2.8 billion. Then, the government predicted its books would balance in two years, but now, the Liberals say they'll need an extra two years. And while the government had predicted the economy would contract by 0.9 per cent, it now says the shrinkage will be 2.9 per cent.</p>
<p>"Nothing's changed for me about how I feel about deficits," said Premier Gordon Campbell, who has said he hates placing financial burdens on the children of British Columbia. "I'm probably more disappointed in that than you are."</p>
<p>Hansen said the recession and other events, including the worst forest-fire season on record, forced the government into deficit financing after five balanced budgets in a row, multiple-billion-dollar surpluses and record job creation.</p>
<p>But he was forced to defend his government's credibility against accusations that before the election, the Liberals knew the province's finances were in much worse shape than they let on.</p>
<p>Hansen said the government will increase medical service plan premiums for most British Columbians, but the costs will decrease for seniors and low-income families. Effective Jan. 1, 2010, premiums will increase by about 6 per cent, a maximum of $3 per month for single people and $6 per family.</p>
<p>On the spending side, the government is increasing the basic personal income tax credit by 17 per cent. It has also raised the budget for fighting forest fires. An extra $80 million is allocated to combating the H1N1 flu virus, and plans for all-day kindergarten are back on the agenda after delays.</p>
<p>Hansen used full-day kindergarten as an example of how families will benefit financially from this budget, an apparent effort to offset some of the anger from British Columbians over the 12 per cent HST, a combination of the provincial sales tax and the federal GST.</p>
<p>Though the tax has sparked talk of a recall campaign, Hansen said it will encourage investment, lower production costs and boost wages.</p>
<p>"It means more jobs, more growth and, over time, higher revenues from resource royalties and business taxes to support services we all depend on, like health care and education," he said. "In the short term, consumers will face higher prices for some goods and services."</p>
<p>Past experience shows savings to business and industry are passed on to consumers, Hansen maintained. The province has also exempted certain items and offered rebates to soften the blow.</p>
<p>The province has received $1.6 billion from Ottawa to switch to the harmonized tax.</p>

</div><div>By Mary Agnes Welch    </div>
<div>696 words</div><div>2 September 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>Manitoba's First Nations will get a new batch of federally funded nursing stations and health clinics -- but most won't be ready in time for this fall's much-feared H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>And, native leaders say they're still waiting for practical help preparing for a possible H1N1 pandemic, as well as assurances that remote reserves will be on the priority list for vaccinations.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq was in Winnipeg Tuesday to announce $135 million for 40 new nursing stations, health clinics and staff residences and 230 renovation projects. Manitoba is getting $39 million for 39 projects.</p>
<p>"Improving the health and well-being of First Nations people is of the utmost importance to our government," said Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>Though the cash was part of January's federal budget, Health Canada isn't sure what most of the constructions projects are yet. Details of only two in Manitoba were released Tuesday. Health Canada said the rest are still being chosen in consultation with First Nations.</p>
<p>And few real improvements to the cramped, outdated, prefab nursing stations and residences on many Manitoba reserves will be completed by this fall, in time for the expected second wave of the H1N1 flu that has already hit First Nations hard.</p>
<p>But Aglukkaq said spending on infrastructure will help in the future, and what's most important is the rollout of a vaccination program that will target those most at risk, including those in remote communities.</p>
<p>She said repeatedly that Ottawa is ready to battle H1N1, and First Nations are, too.</p>
<p>"At this point in time, I don't agree with that," said Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs Grand Chief Ron Evans, who welcomed the new nursing stations but said he has little confidence First Nations are properly prepped for H1N1.</p>
<p>Evans said he is still waiting for clear plans from Health Canada to tackle dozens of outstanding scenarios: How will reserves ensure they have enough nurses and doctors? What happens if there's a shortage of hospital beds? How will fly-in reserves cope if prolonged bad weather grounds medevac flights?</p>
<p>Evans met with Aglukkaq before Tuesday's announcement and got few detailed answers. He said he's hoping to see more specific pandemic plans in two weeks.</p>
<p>Norway House Cree Nation Chief Marcel Balfour said he's dedicated staff and space in his office to creating a pandemic plan. It's a huge job coordinating the band hospital, the school division, the northern health region, the RCMP and Ottawa, but the federal government has been unhelpful.</p>
<p>And he's got practical concerns that require Ottawa's help, such as what to do if the reserve's water truck drivers get sick or RCMP officers can no longer keep the peace in a community with a crime problem.</p>
<p>"I have yet to hear that First Nations people are a priority" for vaccinations, he added.</p>
<p>Despite repeated questioning, it's still not clear if aboriginal people will get top priority for the vaccine to be rolled out in November. Aglukkaq would only say that remote communities would be a high priority since the flu can spread quickly there. And federal health officials said people with chronic diseases like diabetes and high-risk pregnancies will get first crack at a vaccine. Since the criteria already include so many people in remote communities, it makes sense to vaccinate an entire reserve at once.</p>
<p>maryagnes.welch@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>What's coming</p>
<p>from Ottawa</p>
<p>Ottawa has earmarked $38.8 million over the next 18 months for 13 new nursing stations, health clinics and nurses' residences on Manitoba reserves, plus renovations to existing buildings. Details are sketchy, but the projects include:</p>
<p>A $3-million nursing station for Bloodvein First Nation to replace one that is 30 years old. Construction was supposed to start this summer and the station will be finished in a year.</p>
<p>A $2.9-million nurses' residence in York Landing to complement a new health station that should be finished this month. The nurses' residence should be ready in the spring.</p>

</div><div>Elizabeth M. Whelan   </div>

<div>637 words</div><div>2 September 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Meryl Streep, star of the movie Julie & Julia, lashed out this past weekend at the world-famous chef she portrays on screen. In an interview with the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph, Ms. Streep claims that Julia Child's cuisine caused heart disease and calls Child "a pawn of big business." In the process, she attempts to smear the organization I head up, the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH).</p>
<p>Let me share with you the actual facts about Julia Child--and ACSH.</p>
<p>I got to know Julia some 25 years ago. She was no shrinking violet; she was extremely outspoken. She had two major food-related pet peeves: - She despised people who demonized specific foods, like meat, butter and sugar. - She loathed activists who terrified people about the safety of their food.</p>
<p>The two most common statements that Julia would utter on these issues were: "all foods are safe in moderation" and "food is to be enjoyed, not feared."</p>
<p>Ms. Streep attacks the memory of Julia Child by stating that Julia "resisted making a connection between the high-fat diet of heavily-laden cordon bleu-influenced cuisine and cholesterol levels." Nonsense. For Julia, there were no "good foods" or "bad foods" -- just a variety of foods, all in moderation, including an occasional cordon bleu. Julia, unlike her fictional counterpart, exhibited a constant stream of common sense.</p>
<p>Ms. Streep goes on to state that Julia was "in the thrall of something called the American Council on Science and Health, which was a front organization for agro-businesses and petrochemical businesses. They seduced Julia into giving them money."</p>
<p>Here is the real deal: In the spring of 1989, the U. S. experienced its most extensive (and expensive) food scare. And Meryl Streep orchestrated it. She told Americans that apples were "contaminated" with the agricultural chemical Alar (a growth regulator) and that children eating apples were at risk of cancer and other diseases (CBS's 60 Minutes chimed in with a similar story, complete with photos of apples, skull and crossbones, and children in cancer wards). Ms. Streep was omnipresent in the media with her scary message. As I often pointed out, we had an "actress suddenly turned toxicologist" intent on scaring parents about the safety of apples.</p>
<p>My organization, ACSH, was quick to respond. The Alar scare was totally without scientific merit. By the early 1990s, authorities ranging from the World Health Organization to U. S. surgeon general C. Everett Koop confirmed that there was never any health risk posed by the use of Alar. Even the late Don Hewitt, creator of 60 Minutes, told me that he regretted having done the Alar segment, but Ed Bradley, the producer of the piece, refused to retract it.</p>
<p>Julia Child was furious at Meryl Streep for her role in the apple scare. She told me so. Meryl Streep was completely discredited as a credible source about "safer foods" -- so it is astounding that she would bring this subject up again some 20 years later. Her accusation that ACSH was/is a front for petrochemical and agricultural interests is absurd. The organization is funded by a full spectrum of foundations, individuals and unrestricted grants from corporations. It covers public health topics as diverse as swine flu, bioterrorism, cigarette smoking and AIDS. ACSH is directed and advised by nearly 400 independent scientists -- and reports on pure science, not hype. Meryl Streep may be an excellent actress, but she has not proven herself knowledgeable about food safety, nutrition and health, Julia Child, or ACSH. When these subjects come up, she'd be better off keeping quiet or just reading her script. - Dr. Elizabeth Whelan is president of the American Council on Science and Health ( ACSH.org).</p>

<p>(From the Victoria Times Colonist, September 2, 2009) A man in a photo on page A5 yesterday was improperly identified. The man was Grand Chief Ed John of the First Nations Health Council, not Grand Chief Doug Kelly as indicated. The men are properly identified. *****</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq will announce details today of more than $400 million in funding for First Nations health-care projects, Canwest News Service has learned.</p>
<p>The money, allocated in the 2009 budget, is being directed to the construction of 40 new permanent nursing stations and nurses' residences and toward 230 renovation projects in First Nations communities across the country.</p>
<p>Manitoba, where the minister will make the announcement in Winnipeg following a meeting with the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, is getting the most money of all the provinces.</p>
<p>Thirteen new construction projects and 26 renovation projects will be undertaken in communities in this province that will come with a total price tag of $39 million.</p>
<p>But B.C. will not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Yekooche First Nation, near Prince George, has been providing health-care services out of a trailer from 1970 and will be getting a new facility with the funding.</p>
<p>The projects, which the government is committing $135 million to, were chosen according to an agreed-upon plan between Health Canada and First Nations communities.</p>
<p>Another $305 million, to be spread over two years, has also been allocated to improve health care delivery in aboriginal communities. The bulk of that, $204 million, will cover costs for services such as vision and dental care, prescription drug coverage and medical transportation services.</p>
<p>Some of the funding, $65 million, will also be used to expand nursing services so that care is available around the clock in remote and isolated communities.</p>
<p>Of the 40 major construction projects, 16 have already started. They are all expected to be completed by March 2011.</p>
<p>In B.C., a unique health agreement between First Nations and the federal and provincial governments will help cope with any resurgence of the H1N1 flu virus in the province's aboriginal communities, Aglukkaq said yesterday during a visit to Victoria.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq, who met with members of the First Nations Health Council and B.C. Healthy Living Minister Ida Chong, said the tripartite plan, signed one year ago, is already bringing health benefits, including planning for H1N1.</p>
<p>"No one knows the health care needs of First Nations better than the people themselves," Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>An H1N1 Health Partners Group, chaired by two First Nations physicians, is completing an action plan for B.C.'s remote and rural aboriginal communities.</p>
<p>First Nations, who were disproportionately hard-hit by the flu virus last spring, could be on the priority list for H1N1 vaccine, said Aglukkaq, who will discuss with health professionals in Winnipeg how the vaccine will be distributed this fall.</p>
<p>There will be enough vaccine in Canada for anyone who wants it, Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>However, a priority list is necessary because the 50 million doses ordered by the federal government will not all be ready at the same time.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pandemic preparations; Focus on: NHL The league is playing close attention to the H1N1 virus</b>
</div><div>KEN WARREN   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>796 words</div><div>1 September 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>C2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>When the H1N1 virus first appeared in Mexico in April, professional soccer leagues there reacted quickly and dramatically to avoid a quick escalation in the number of cases.</p>
<p>Nearly 200 Mexican League games were played in empty stadiums.</p>
<p>CONCACAF, soccer's governing body in North America, cancelled an under-17 tournament. The Nationwide Golf Tour, one step below the PGA, cancelled the Mexico Open tournament, which was originally scheduled for late May.</p>
<p>This cautious approach spread across the border to the southern United States, where many high schools either cancelled or postponed games and track meets.</p>
<p>An official with the Mexican soccer club Pachua put it best: "Unfortunately, it's very sad to see the stadium like this - but the most important things are human lives."</p>
<p>The comment certainly puts professional sports in perspective.</p>
<p>It also gives us pause to consider how North America's major professional leagues will deal with the second wave of the virus that most health experts are predicting will come this fall and winter.</p>
<p>How serious would the crisis have to be for the National Hockey League to tell its teams to play without fans in the seats? How severe would the crisis level be for the NHL to cancel games outright? Would the NHL,</p>
<p>National Football League, Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association balk at giving up billions in potential revenues because of health concerns?</p>
<p>At this point, the sports world is operating on a business as usual schedule, while keeping a cautious eye on how a second wave of the virus might develop.</p>
<p>Texas Rangers pitcher Vicente Padilla was diagnosed with the H1N1 virus in late July - believed to be the first athlete on a major pro team to test positive - but it passed as quickly as any other flu might have, meaning he only missed a few days of action. Accordingly, there were no major concerns around the majors.</p>
<p>NHL officials haven't yet made any major changes to how they operate.</p>
<p>"It has been a situation that we continue to monitor," said Gary Meagher, the NHL's senior vice-president of public relations.</p>
<p>Likewise, teams such as the Ottawa Senators aren't doing anything differently.</p>
<p>"Internally, we have certainly advised staff that if they're sick, don't come to work," said Tom Conroy, vice-president and executive director at Ottawa's Scotiabank Place. "We have hand sanitizers in all our staff offices and staff washrooms. You would expect that people who are not feeling well would stay at home (from Senators games), but at this point, we don't have a plan to have a public announcement on that."</p>
<p>That doesn't mean Senators doctors are taking the H1N1 virus lightly.</p>
<p>"From a sports perspective, whenever you have teams coming together and there's a concern about a potential epidemic or pandemic, it's obviously a concern," said Mark Aubry, the Senators' team physician and chief medical officer for the International Ice Hockey Federation.</p>
<p>Aubry, who was at the world hockey championship in Switzerland last spring when H1N1 cases first appeared in Mexico, says all 16 teams followed the guidelines set out by the World Health Organization and local public health associations.</p>
<p>"We took all the necessary precautionary measures, including lots of hand washing," Aubry said. "We didn't forgo the handshaking routine (after games), because there was very little concern, very few cases, in Switzerland at the time."</p>
<p>Aubry says the IIHF will not hesitate to cancel events, if that's the recommendation from the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>"We monitor it, we watch it," he said. "We talk about it and we'll see where it goes. We have cancelled events before. When SARS happened (in 2003), we cancelled the world women's championships in China. I was part of the discussions that went on. It was only three or four days before the championships were supposed to begin that we cancelled it. It's not something we take lightly. At the same time, we don't want to jump to conclusions and start cancelling things just because there may be something out there."</p>
<p>If and when a flu shot for the H1N1 virus is available, NHL players will be encouraged to get it, but NHL teams don't have the power to make it mandatory.</p>
<p>NHL players are constantly flying because of their travel schedule, but Aubry says that doesn't make them any more likely to catch the virus than the general population.</p>

<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq will announce today details of more than $400 million in funding for First Nations health-care projects, Canwest News Service has learned.</p>
<p>The money, allocated in the 2009 budget, is being directed to the construction of 40 new permanent nursing stations and nurses' residences and toward 230 renovation projects in First Nations communities across the country.</p>
<p>Manitoba, where the minister will make the announcement in Winnipeg following a meeting with the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, is getting the most money of all the provinces.</p>
<p>Thirteen new construction projects and 26 renovation projects will be undertaken in communities in Manitoba, bringing the total price tag the province to $39 million.</p>
<p>The federal government has been heavily criticized this summer over its handling of the swine flu, which hit several reserves particularly hard during the first wave of the pandemic in the spring.</p>

</p>
<p>Colombian President Alvaro Uribe is expected to fully recover from swine flu by midweek, his office said Monday, a day after announcing that he had become the second Latin leader to contract the virus.</p>
<p>Uribe's office announced Sunday that the Colombian leader appeared to have caught the A(H1N1) virus after attending a regional summit last week in Argentina, and other governments had been notified.</p>
<p>The president's personal physician Gustavo Aristizabal told local radio that Uribe would require two additional days of treatment, "but by Wednesday afternoon, he should be able to resume normal activity."</p>
<p>Uribe first began to feel ill at around midday on Friday, but his symptoms, including persistent cough and fever, already appeared to be subsiding, the physician said.</p>
<p>"Since Saturday, the president has ceased to have fever. He shows general signs of illness--a sore throat, a little achiness in the chest--but now he is on the road toward full recovery," Aristizabal said.</p>
<p>A doctor treating the 57-year-old president, Carlos Alvarez, said Uribe was prescribed the antiviral drug Tamiflu and that he "does not need hospitalization." But he is being told to rest, something the fast-moving 57-year-old apparently does not do very often. Uribe has maintained a gruelling schedule since coming to power in 2002, routinely starting his workday at 5 a. m. and working late into the night.</p>
<p>While in isolation Uribe was continuing to carry out some his official duties by phone and Internet, said a spokesman.</p>
<p>Deaths from swine flu in Latin America--the worst-hit region in the world--rose to over 1,300 this month. To date, 34 people have died of the flu in Colombia, official data show. A total of 621 infections have been confirmed.</p>

<p>MINERS APPEAL FOR SUPPORT</p>
<p>MONTREAL / The Mining Association of Canada, the national group representing the country's$40-billion mining industry, is urging all three levels of government to show their support as members face the heavy impact of the global recession on production and jobs.</p>
<p>Operations at 32 mines have been closed or suspended over the past half-year, the association said, and many companies are operating at well below capacity. It wants more infrastructure projects, better regulatory efficiency, more access to land, more northern development and more tax incentives to encourage investment.</p>
<p>SIGNS OF HOPE IN U.S. STATS</p>
<p>CHICAGO / A cluster of regional reports Monday showed business activity picking up steam in August, suggesting the U.S. economy is breaking free of its deep recession.</p>
<p>One report showed a nearly year-long plunge in economic activity in the U.S. Midwest came to a halt last month as new orders and production rose sharply, potentially a harbinger for the national economy.</p>
<p>Still, a top Federal Reserve policy-maker warned that the U.S. economy remains fragile and unemployment high.</p>
<p>U.S. LIFE INSURANCE SALES FALL</p>
<p>NEW YORK / U.S. life insurance sales to individuals dropped 20 per cent in the second quarter amid a weaker economy, contributing to the biggest six-month decline since 1942.</p>
<p>Premium sales fell 23 per cent in the first half, LIMRA International said Monday.</p>
<p>"There's less money to go around" as savers invest their assets, said Steven Schwartz, an analyst with <span class="companylink">Raymond James Financial Inc</span>.</p>
<p>"Variable products have been dead before. Historically they've come back as markets come back."</p>
<p>LINK EXIT STRATEGIES: IMF</p>
<p>WASHINGTON / Officials from the world's major economies should co-ordinate exit strategies when the time comes to withdraw support for growth, the No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund said Monday.</p>
<p>"These kinds of policies will be more effective if they're unwound in a co-ordinated way rather than an unco-ordinated way that could create strains and costs for other countries," IMF first deputy managing director John Lipsky said.</p>
<p>"In many areas such as bank guarantees or other specific governmental support for markets, often these have spillover effects."</p>
<p>FUNDS DUMP RETAIL SHARES</p>
<p>NEW YORK / Mutual funds, pensions and endowments are unloading U.S. consumer stocks at the fastest pace in at least 14 years.</p>
<p>Institutions controlling $16.4 trillion US sold $1.8 billion more than they bought of department stores, distillers and hoteliers this month, according to data compiled by <span class="companylink">State Street Corp</span>.</p>
<p>"Whenever you have a question mark with regard to (consumers') ability to spend, you're going to have a drawback in those stocks," said Randy Bateman, chief investment officer at the asset management unit of <span class="companylink">Huntington Bancshares</span>.</p>
<p>U.S. Commerce Department data show salaries for Americans dropped the most in at least five decades during the 12 months through June.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> said this month that almost half of U.S. homeowners may owe more on mortgages than the properties are worth by 2011.</p>
<p>STIMULUS FEEDING INFLATION</p>
<p>WASHINGTON / The Federal Reserve will be unable to prevent the trillions of dollars in government stimulus pumped into the U.S. economy from stoking inflation over the next decade, a survey of business economists showed.</p>
<p>The price gauge tracked by the central bank will rise three per cent a year on average from 2014 through 2018, according to the median estimate in a poll taken by the National Association for Business Economics. The rate exceeds the two-per-cent pace that the respondents said was the Fed's unofficial target.</p>
<p>The report is in line with surveys of consumers and indicates the central bank may have to work harder to damp inflation expectations after pouring more than $1 trillion US into credit markets in a strategy known as quantitative easing.</p>
<p>CRISIS A PLUS FOR CLIMATE: EU</p>
<p>BRUSSELS / Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union fell for the fourth year running in 2008, thanks to the economic recession, the European Environment Agency said Monday.</p>
<p>The official EEA estimates showed a 1.5-per-cent drop in emissions from the 27-nation European Union as a whole and a 1.3-per-cent drop from its 15 older and richer members.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of the decline in emissions in 2008 was due to lower CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel combustion in the energy, industry and transport sectors," the environment agency said in a statement.</p>
<p>DEAL LINKED TO FLU VACCINE</p>
<p>TORONTO / Small Canadian biotech company <span class="companylink">Medicago Inc</span>. said on Monday it expects to sign a licensing agreement with a Middle East company soon, a deal that it said will pave the way for the development of its swine flu vaccine in the region.</p>
<p>Medicago would not name the company nor the country in which it is based.</p>
<p>The agreement would most likely be a non-exclusive licensing deal and technology transfer under which the Mideast company would build a manufacturing facility and use Medicago's technology in exchange for milestone and royalty payments.</p>
<p>EURO PRICE SLIDE SLOWS</p>
<p>BRUSSELS / Eurozone consumer prices fell for the third month running year-on-year in August, data showed on Monday, but by less than the record drop in July and economists expect them to start growing again in coming months.</p>
<p>Prices in the 16-country area fell 0.2 per cent this month, European Union statistics office Eurostat estimated, after a 0.7-percent drop in July and a 0.1-per-cent easing in June.</p>
<p>Economists had expected a 0.3-per-cent fall in August, but some had forecast a 0.2-per-cent dip after stronger-than-expected German inflation data last week.</p>
<p>The data comes before the European Central Bank's interest rate setting meeting on Thursday, at which markets expect the bank to leave its main refinancing rate unchanged at a record low of one per cent despite nascent signs of an economic recovery.</p>
<p>BRAZIL TO SANCTION U.S.</p>
<p>GENEVA / Brazil can impose $294.7 million US of sanctions against U.S. goods to compensate for subsidies paid to American cotton farmers, the World Trade Organization said Monday.</p>
<p>The figure, which is about 10 per cent of the$2.68 billion US sought by Brazil, is based on the actual impact of the U.S. payments on the biggest Latin American economy.</p>
<p>The decision followed a June 2008 ruling by WTO judges upholding a panel's finding that the U.S. hasn't done enough to scrap aid to its cotton producers.</p>
<p>The WTO found in September 2004 that as much as$4 billion US in annual U.S. cotton payments broke global trade rules by encouraging excess production and driving down world prices.</p>
<p>CRISIS ISN'T OVER: BANKER</p>
<p>ALPBACH, Austria / European Central Bank governing council member Ewald Nowotny warned against declaring the financial crisis over on Monday, and said there was conflict between European competition policies and macro economic policies.</p>
<p>Nowotny, who heads the Austrian central bank, warned that people should not get carried away with recent improvements in economic data, mirroring similar comments from ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet.</p>
<p>"We did manage to prevent a collapse, but I must strongly warn against the end of difficult (economic) times," Nowotny said in a speech at an economic forum.</p>
<p>KENYAN INFLATION HITS 18.4%</p>
<p>NAIROBI, Kenya / Kenya's inflation rate rose to 18.4 per cent in August from 17.8 per cent in July, mainly due to an increase in the prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks, the government's statistics office said Monday.</p>

<p>'THAT'S HOT' HILTON CARD THREATENS TO BURN HALLMARK</p>
<p>NEW YORK / The celebrity and heiress Paris Hilton may pursue her lawsuit against Hallmark Cards over its use of her picture and catchphrase "That's hot" on a greeting card, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.</p>
<p>Hilton had contended that Hallmark violated her privacy and right of publicity by ripping off a scene from her reality TV show The Simple Life on a birthday card captioned "Paris's First Day as a Waitress."</p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Hallmark's argument that its depiction of the <span class="companylink">Hilton Hotels</span> heiress was protected speech as a matter of law.</p>
<p>It sent the case back to a lower court, which had turned aside Hilton's claim of trademark infringement, but rejected other Hallmark defences.</p>
<p>Lincoln Bandlow, a lawyer at Lathrop & Gage LLP in Los Angeles representing Hallmark, said "the analysis of the First Amendment defence is incorrect. It will leave a lot of speakers subjected to merit-less right of publicity claims."</p>
<p>He said Hallmark will evaluate options, including a possible appeal to the full 9th Circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Brent Blakely, a lawyer for Hilton, was not available for comment.</p>
<p>The card showed Hilton's face superimposed on a cartoon of a waitress serving a plate of food to a restaurant customer.</p>
<p>Hilton tells the customer, "Don't touch that, it's hot." The customer asks, "What's hot?" Hilton responds, "That's hot." The inside of the card reads: "Have a smokin' hot birthday."</p>
<p>The appeals court rejected Hallmark's argument that the card was sufficiently "transformative" as to deserve automatic protection because the setting was different and the phrase "that's hot" referred to the temperature of a plate of food.</p>
<p>While noting differences from the TV show, including that the cartoon body was of a generic female and not Hilton, Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain said "the basic setting is the same: we see Paris Hilton, born to privilege, working as a waitress."</p>
<p>He concluded that Hilton "has at least some probability of prevailing on the merits before a trier of fact."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sick leave dilemma for flu patients; Workers told to stay away from work</b>
</div><div>Suzanne Wilton   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>940 words</div><div>1 September 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Many Calgary workers could find themselves in a quandary if they come down with the flu this fall, as advice from health officials conflicts with many workplace policies regarding illness.</p>
<p>Calling in sick for one day isn't a big deal with most employers, but if it amounts to seven -- the number of days Alberta Health Services recommends people with flu symptoms stay at home -- most employees are required to cough up a doctor's note. But even that could be tricky with health officials advising people to stay away from the doctor's office unless they have severe symptoms.</p>
<p>"Our advice is based on helping reduce the spread of illness," says James Finstad, of Alberta Health Services.</p>
<p>The issue is being talked about among Calgary Transit drivers, whose union is predicting absenteeism to climb as high as 50 per cent if the H1N1 virus returns this fall.</p>
<p>"I know that's going to have a major impact," said Amalgamated Transit Union president Mike Mahar, who represents 1,800 city drivers.</p>
<p>Mahar said a few drivers were diagnosed with the new strain of flu earlier this year and many are afraid of catching it this fall or winter.</p>
<p>Buses and trains are breeding grounds for disease, with hundreds of hands that may have earlier covered a coughing mouth, or touched handles or seats.</p>
<p>"I think for the majority of society, it's going to be about containment," said Mahar.</p>
<p>"We fully support that if you're not feeling good, don't come to work."</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada figures an influenza pandemic could involve 4.5 million to 10.6 million Canadians being off work, the deaths of 11,000 to 58,000 people and the hospitalization of 34,000 to 138,000 people.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services recommends people with flu symptoms stay home from work for seven days or a full 24 hours after the symptoms disappear. They are also asking people to self-monitor, and visit the doctor only if their symptoms worsen.</p>
<p>Because of this, Mahar said he's confident the rules around documenting illness will be relaxed by the city's benefits group.</p>
<p>"I think the potential for spread is absolutely greater (on buses and trains.) And drivers are much more susceptible. On a national level, our Canadian director has made a request to the (national) health minister that they be one of the first lines of inoculation."</p>
<p>Tom Sampson, deputy chief of the Calgary Emergency Management Agency, said the city's policy of requiring a doctor's note for illness lasting beyond five days poses "quite a conundrum."</p>
<p>"In essence, you're asking people to get doctor's notes at the time when the health system may be overwhelmed," he said.</p>
<p>The five-day rule at the city is required by its health insurer, said Sampson. To get around the rules, the city will be forced to either activate its emergency plan or declare a state of emergency. Sampson said that will be done if absenteeism reaches unusually high levels.</p>
<p>Employees, he added, are not required to state why they're off when they call in sick, but will be encouraged to report if they have flu symptoms.</p>
<p>"We're going to ask employees to self-disclose, so at least...we can ensure their workplace is cleaned."</p>
<p>D'Arcy Lanovaz said the city's inside workers won't likely stay off work for seven days--even if they are ill.</p>
<p>"The reality is people will stay at home when they're flat out, but more often than not, I've seen people . . soldier on and come in," said Lanovaz, business agent for Local 38.</p>
<p>Aside from transit, schools are also places where it will be important to contain the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>But while parents have been asked to keep their kids at home if they're sick, it seems some teachers will still be required to prove they've got the flu if they're not back after a few days.</p>
<p>The Calgary Catholic district, for example, says educators who fall ill and stay home beyond three days will still be required to bring in a note.</p>
<p>"If things changed and evolved over the next couple of months, depending on what happens with this, we might consider(waiving the requirement) later on. But I don't think it's something we're looking at in the immediate future," said spokeswoman Janet Sutherland.</p>
<p>Public teachers are asked to provide proof of illness after being off work for five days, however, board spokesman Ted Flitton said he anticipates employees will be given leeway.</p>
<p>University professors and support staff could also get a free pass for the flu as officials at the U of C consider whether they'll waive the demand for a doctor's note, too.</p>
<p>As of Aug. 28, there were 127 hospitalized confirmed cases of H1N1 in Alberta, with the virus contributing to the deaths of seven people.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>When To Seek Medical Help</p>
<p>If your symptoms are getting worse, or you are not recovering, call health link Alberta at 403-943-5465 for medical advice or your doctor for an appointment. If your symptoms become severe, go to an emergency centre right away. For example, if you are experiencing: - problems breathing; - pain in your chest; or - a high fever that does not get better after three or four days.</p>
<p>Some people should always see their doctor if they get the flu--for example, a person with heart or lung disease.</p>

</p>
<p>On Saturday, The Sun did a great job with its special articles on H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>In 1975, the last threat believed to be swine flu was miraculously contained within Fort Dix, New Jersey, where a prompt, effective quarantine prevented a continental spread to British Columbia. As a result of this containment, B.C. had no swine influenza, but following the use of hundreds of thousand of doses of vaccine we had a number of cases of paralytic illnesses diagnosed as Guillain Barre syndrome, so a degree of caution expressed this time in the use of panic-driven vaccine is warranted.</p>
<p>In The Sun's coverage, there was contradictory advice: "Get lots of rest" and "Be active."</p>
<p>One thousand persons out of 100,000 population died in the 1918-19 pandemic. Most who died were young adults who couldn't go to bed: young mothers, nurses, firemen and police officers. This observation came from an elderly physician in Kitsilano who had been in active practice in Vancouver in 1918-19.</p>
<p>It is interesting that following the last Manitoba epidemic of polio (in 1953), a disproportionate number of paralyzed young athletes in training chose not to interrupt their training and ended up in iron lungs. (I was part of their later care.) Perhaps bed rest is the better of the two options recommended in viral epidemics.</p>

<p>I was annoyed at the Saturday edition of the Citizen with its cover-to-cover focus on the H1N1 flu pandemic. Nearly every section of the newspaper presented possible impacts on everything from schools and small businesses to restaurants, concerts, local children's activities and major professional sports like the NHL.</p>
<p>Every expert interviewed said many of the same things: stay home if you don't feel well, wash your hands properly and frequently, avoid people who are sick, and sneeze or cough into your elbow. Did it take such extensive coverage to say that?</p>
<p>Let us know when a health problem is developing in our region, and elsewhere -- as disease knows no boundaries.</p>
<p>In the meantime, why not raise the alarm about a more concrete issue like the harmonization of GST and PST on July 1, 2010? If the media wants to get people whipped into a frenzy, that's a cause for them. Why don't reporters do some serious cost analysis and provide readers with real information on what this is going to mean to people in dollar terms?</p>

<p>Why do I keep feeling I have been through this before? Does Y2K sound familiar? Someone must think the sky is ready to fall? I'm beginning to think that the World Health Organization's approach is the biggest infection of all time.</p>
<p>As a frequent viewer of New Zealand and Australian newspapers online, I wondered if I must have missed something. So I went back and did a search for flu stories. Since so many people in this hemisphere are concerned that H1N1 will devastate our world once cooler weather sets in, and since it's winter down under, there must be a huge problem that I had missed reading about. Well, guess what! Australia and New Zealand are each reporting only a handful of flu-related deaths and spring is now on the way.</p>
<p>After wading through the Saturday edition of the Citizen and given what many agencies in Canada are going through to be ready, I guess the sky really is falling, I just haven't noticed it yet.</p>

<p>The Citizen listed several ways to minimize risk catching the swine flu. Another way is nutrition.</p>
<p>Eating glutathione-rich foods like avocados, watermelons, beets, grapefruits, curly kale and sesame, to cite just a few among a plethora of others, could contribute significantly to bolster, stimulate and keep in good shape our immune system. It is our first and foremost protective shield. We can help by increasing its capacity to resist disease and upgrading the odds of staving off the dangerous foe. Adequate nutrition is an arm of prevention.</p>
<p>The book Eat for Immunity by Kirsten Hartvig presents those immune system-boosting superfoods. Eat for immunity should be the public theme of the ongoing information campaign about H1N1 at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm convinced that avocado every day can keep H1N1 away.</p>

<p>Re: The ethics of vaccination, Aug. 29.</p>
<p>Working within the health-care system for 10 years, I discovered early that there is strong pressure to receive flu vaccines each year, despite evidence of risk and limited effectiveness.</p>
<p>There is a strong wall of opposition to hearing any of the concerns regarding the risk of vaccines. For example, I discovered that flu vaccines for adults still contain thimersol, a mercury-based chemical, despite concerns about its effects.</p>
<p>Regarding the H1N1 vaccine, it is being fast-tracked with limited testing. There is literature suggesting that it will also include a squaline adjuvant to heighten the body's immune response. According to the Vaccine Risk Awareness Network, this adjuvant has been associated with long-term auto-immune damage.</p>
<p>As an Ottawa health-care worker, I would be one of the canaries in the mine. I am concerned that the risks due to the vaccine may be greater than the risk of the virus itself.</p>
<p>However, no one seems prepared to have an open and honest discussion about the risks I will be exposed to in receiving the vaccine, nor has there been any discussion about a safety net if I were to become ill in the course of my duties. I am also angry that I am made to feel guilty if I put my own health-care needs above the needs of patients.</p>
<p>A large part of my job as a social worker for the past 25 years has been client advocacy. I have seen firsthand the depressing struggle clients face in negotiating with insurance companies and other disability-related institutions while at their most vulnerable. Insurance companies, that have more resources, fight hard not to pay.</p>
<p>I absolutely do have not faith that the system will be there for me. I likely would hear: "Prove that our vaccine caused your illness."</p>
<p>Some pharmaceutical companies have been less than ethical in some practices. Their bottom line seems to be profit, not wellness. The companies are pressured to get this vaccine out. If the clinical trials don't go well, I doubt that the public would ever hear about it.</p>
<p>I am also angry that the medical system refuses to acknowledge or work with complementary medicine. We are years behind many other countries in this regard. Articles have reported that during the 1918 flu pandemic, there was only a one-per-cent mortality rate among those treated homeopathically, yet this method is rarely acknowledged or discussed.</p>
<p>I wish that for once we could have an open and honest discussion leading to forward-thinking and true informed consent.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Lawyers argue dropping charges against drug squad officers</p>
<p>Crown lawyers are arguing in court today against a decision that saw 30 counts of corruption against six former Toronto drug squad police officers thrown out. The charges were stayed in January 2008 because the case took too long to get to trial - the six men were charged four years prior. The Crown is before the Court of Appeal for Ontario today arguing that the delay, due to various factors, was not unreasonable. Crown attorney Ken Campbell says by not complaining about the trial date when it was set, the defence lawyers effectively waived their clients' right to take issue with that portion of the delay.</p>

<p>The federal health minister says Canada's First Nations will be prepared for a possible outbreak of swine flu this fall. Leona Aglukkaq says Ottawa has been working with aboriginal leaders to ensure vaccines and other health equipment will be sent to First Nations communities. She says the focus will be on early prevention and preparedness, and she insists First Nations across Canada are ready if the H1N1 pandemic becomes worse. Ottawa has faced harsh criticism from native leaders who have said many communities aren't ready, and that other problems including overcrowded housing, lack of running water and poor funding will make matters worse.</p>

<p>The Department of Fisheries and Oceans has ordered a stop to the harvesting of some types of shellfish in the Maritimes. The ban, which includes clams, oysters, mussels and quahogs, extends to all of Nova Scotia and P.E.I., southwestern New Brunswick and much of the gulf shore of New Brunswick. It was prompted by concerns over increased bacterial levels brought on by recent heavy rains. Environment Canada is doing tests in some areas to determine levels of contamination. It's not clear how long the ban, which does not include scallops, will be in effect.</p>

The man died Sunday during the swimming part of the race, which also includes cycling and running. A race volunteer says the man was swimming toward the shore of Okanagan Lake when he began to tire. The cause of death is not immediately known. Meanwhile, Jordan Rapp of New York won the men's race with a time of eight hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds.

The accused, who cannot be identified, was charged after a 15-year-old opponent was knocked unconscious with a cross-check to the back of the neck during a line change. It happened last January in a game in Southhampton, Ont., between the midget-level Arran-Elderslie Ice Dogs and the Saugeen Shores Storm. The incident went unnoticed by referees and no penalty was called on the play.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mexico picks up tab for medical coverage; Capital city hopes free plan will help win back travellers in wake of swine flu outbreak</b>
</div><div>San Grewal   </div>

<p>You know that annoying feeling, after paying a couple grand for a vacation, when you're then asked to shell out more for insurance? Well, if you're planning a trip to Mexico City you don't have to worry - the Mexican government's got you covered.</p>
<p>As part of a plan to counter declining tourism following the H1N1 flu outbreak, Mexico City is now paying for full medical coverage, trip cancellation (under most circumstances) and things such as loss of documents.</p>
<p>"All you have to do is register to stay at a hotel in the city and you will automatically receive the insurance," says Carlos Ramirez, marketing director for the Mexico City tourism ministry.</p>
<p>"Even if you break a foot or need heart surgery, you will be fully covered."</p>
<p>The coverage, provided by Spanish insurer Mapfre, started about a month ago and will go on indefinitely.</p>
<p>The tourism ministry has done some marketing for the plan and is about to launch a large North American advertising campaign, Ramirez says.</p>
<p>The cost for the coverage is about $30 (U.S.) for each visitor, a small price to convince people the city is safe, Ramirez says.</p>
<p>"It's about telling people that we are confident that our city is not a place where people have to worry about the influenza."</p>
<p>After the swine flu outbreak in April, hotel occupancy in Mexico City dropped to 23 per cent, Ramirez says.</p>
<p>But thanks in part to the insurance program, which is also open to Mexican visitors, occupancy in late August was between 70 and 80 per cent.</p>
<p>"Part of that is because the worst of the outbreak seems to be over and the summer is a more popular time to visit, but we have had a very good response to the insurance program," he said.</p>
<p>Toronto is one major city that can relate to what Mexico City is going through. In 2003, tourism here fell drastically because of the SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>"I think, from a North American perspective, (the Mexico City plan) is a pretty good strategy," says Duncan Ross, who managed tourism for the City of Toronto during the SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>"Mexico is so dependent on tourism, when something like this happens they have to take innovative measures."</p>
<p>Ross says that unlike the respected Canadian health care system, many North Americans really don't understand Mexico's.</p>
<p>But the free comprehensive insurance plan might allay worries about insurance coverage or care in Mexico.</p>
<p>With so much travel booked online, he adds, the free insurance could convince prospective visitors making their own plans that everything is okay.</p>
<p>As for Toronto, Ross says the approach to attract tourists during SARS was to offer discounts such as a $99 package that included a hotel stay, theatre tickets, a meal and tickets to a Blue Jays game.</p>
<p>"The first thing you do is compete on price. But it takes a lot to build consumer confidence in cases when there's disease and outbreak."</p>

<p>With the recent economic downturn in the United States, lower demand for meat has meant U.S. livestock producers have struggled. That has spurred recent trade protectionism, including country of origin labeling regulations (COOL) that essentially require U.S. meat processors to segregate live Canadian cattle and hogs from U.S. animals.</p>
<p>The package must then be labelled as containing Canadian meat. But this separate labelling has been too costly for most U.S. processors so they have been unwilling to accept Canadian animals.</p>
<p>The results of COOL are a tightened, protectionist border. Canadian hog exports to the U.S. for market pigs have dropped to 585,000 pigs from January through June. That compares to 1.4 million for the same period a year earlier -- about a 60 per cent drop.</p>
<p>At $100 per hog market value, this loss is around $81.5 million, or $163 million over a full year (not to mention a 30 per cent drop in feeder pig exports). Also, slaughter-cattle exports are down 20 per cent and feeder-cattle exports are down by 50 per cent.</p>
<p>In May 2009, Canada requested a WTO consultation to object to the U.S. regulations. While the U.S. administration and Democrats in the House and Senate talk free trade, their actions have been the opposite and have restricted trade.</p>
<p>These restrictions are being championed by a small number of U.S. agricultural producer groups, primarily R-CALF and the National Farmers Union -- U.S. agriculture groups who represent only a minority of farmers but who successfully lobbied the U.S. government to impose the COOL regulations.</p>
<p>Part of the dispute is related to the new U.S. secretary of Agriculture who has decided to aggressively enforce the country of origin labeling.</p>
<p>But this isn't surprising, since Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both stated in last year's presidential debates they would consider renegotiating NAFTA and were supported by anti-trade groups. This is in contrast to the Bush administration that mostly let trade flow freely.</p>
<p>Keeping U.S. and international markets open for Canadian livestock is especially important for the financial survival of Canadian producers. They have been hit hard by high feed-grain prices driven up by U.S. ethanol policy, weak livestock prices, a strong Canadian dollar, "mad-cow disease"-related border closures for cattle, and H1N1-related border closures for pork to some countries. Enforcing country-of-origin labeling was a further blow.</p>
<p>In the long term, a U.S. market loss for Canadian live animals would require building more meat processing capacity in Canada. More exports of Canadian processed beef and pork would go to Asia, given the rising Asian income and growing market, since it's too expensive to ship live animals to Asia.</p>
<p>However, Canada's meat processing plant size is smaller and less cost-competitive than the huge U.S. plants, and so Canada still needs to export live animals to the U.S., especially in the short-term.</p>
<p>For now, fighting COOL is the first priority for Canada. With a small population a tenth of the U.S., and 75 per cent of its trade dependent on the U.S., Canada also must band together with other countries to convince the Obama administration to drop its outdated and wrong-headed trade restrictions before they get worse.</p>
<p>For example, back in 1930, U.S. tariffs were increased on 20,000 products as a means to rescue the U.S. from an economic downturn -- the disastrous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. That approach should serve as a reminder of the dangers of protectionism now.</p>
<p>Smoot-Hawley backfired and created a world trade war, and was a significant cause of the Great Depression. Trade fell by 65 per cent, and unemployment hit 25 per cent.</p>
<p>Archaic trade restrictions from the U.S. administration were tried in 1930 and brought the world economy to its knees - and they're still nonsensical today. As baseball great Yogi Berra said, "it sounds like déjà vu all over again."</p>

</p>
<p>British Columbians have always been a skeptical, cynical lot, but the past few months have surely taken us to a new level of disdain for what we hear from our elected representatives.</p>
<p>The budget being unveiled today will cast aside much of what was presented to us in the February budget. That makes sense, because the February version was far too optimistic. But that doesn't mean we should embrace today's budget or assume that it will be right on the money.</p>
<p>We should expect Finance Minister Colin Hansen to err on the side of caution this time around. That's because it is better to be bleakly pessimistic in a budget than even slightly optimistic.</p>
<p>Pessimism means that when most budget years draw to a close, the finance minister can smile for the cameras as he or she boasts of another surplus and how the money can be used to pay down the debt or for new programs or some such thing. The sun shines brightly, flowers bloom, children sing and all that stuff.</p>
<p>Budgetary pessimism also means that when the economy goes sour, the finance minister has a bit of wiggle room.</p>
<p>The B.C. Liberals have shown a clear preference for promising a little and delivering a lot -- namely, a huge surplus at the end of the fiscal year. They broke that trend, however, with the budget that Hansen unveiled in February.</p>
<p>That document was optimistic through and through. It was based on a deficit of just $495 million, a number pooh-poohed almost immediately given the rapidly deteriorating state of the economy in British Columbia and around the world. Since then, things have only become worse, with forest fires and the H1N1 virus drawing even more from the government's accounts.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the February budget was based on the government being able to find a few hundred million dollars in savings. Just because a program had a spot in the budget, there was no guarantee it would survive the post-budget cut. In other words, we could not believe much of what we saw in it.</p>
<p>Wishful thinking might be good strategy for a political party trying to get through an election, but ultimately it's not in the best interest of the voters.</p>
<p>Let's hope that Hansen's budget today will include hard commitments. The government's credibility has been seriously damaged in the past few months and it will be tough to win back those voters who had stayed with the Liberals through thick and thin, but have lost faith.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean we should pay much attention, though, to the polls that show Liberal support has been in freefall. It's interesting, but not relevant. The next election is almost four years away and the Liberals are in no danger of being booted out of office before that unless the recall legislation works, which it won't.</p>
<p>That means Premier Gordon Campbell can do pretty much anything he wants right now, relying on good times later in his term to dull the memories of voters. And anyway, unless the New Democrats can position themselves as a viable alternative, a fourth term with the Liberals is virtually assured.</p>
<p>Campbell's vow that he will stay to fight the next election is also irrelevant. It would be foolish for him to say anything else; the day that the premier announces that he is leaving, even if the departure date is a year away, a few dozen Liberal MLAs will start running in different directions.</p>
<p>The way that Campbell is once again reshaping the government indicates that he is committed to sticking around for a while. He might still be gone by 2013, but for now, he does not look like a premier planning to quit anytime soon.</p>
<p>Hansen needs to be frank in his budget speech today. He needs to address what has gone wrong, and what the government will do to fix things. He could start by admitting that the fiscal mess has been made worse because the government did not set aside enough money in good times to see it through bad times. We have to pay now -- through higher taxes or reduced services -- to make up for the oversight.</p>
<p>Yes, most of us are cynical about the honesty of our elected leaders. But perhaps that might change if we were given the straight goods rather than spin.</p>

<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada recommendations for some people in high-risk groups during the H1N1 pandemic include the advice to consider avoiding crowds.</p>
<p>Pigs are getting no such advice.</p>
<p>It's striking that public-health authorities are saying so little about the crowded conditions on factory farms worldwide.</p>
<p>"It's really clear that this virus comes from the swine lineage," says Earl Brown, executive director of the Emerging Pathogens Research Centre at the University of Ottawa. "There are big questions about farming practices that nobody wants to talk about."</p>
<p>Of course nobody wants to talk about it. Who wants a group of piglets to show up on their doorstep along with a note from angry farmers?</p>
<p>Nobody seems to know yet exactly how this particular strain of flu evolved from its predecessors and showed up in the human population in Mexico. There is no evidence that it came directly from a pig farm. What we do know is that the virus is related to a family of flu viruses that did emerge on North American pig farms in the 1990s. And we know this virus contains elements of pig, bird and human flu.</p>
<p>We also know that, as Brown puts it, "high-density farming leads to high virulence."</p>
<p>Last year, the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production, in the U.S., issued a report called "Putting Meat on the Table: Industrial Farm Animal Production in America." One of the areas it examined was the potential impact of big pig farms on public health. "The potential for pathogen transfer from animals to humans is increased in industrial farm animal production because so many animals are raised together in confined areas," the report said.</p>
<p>When pigs and humans do share the same strain of flu -- as they seem to with this pandemic strain of H1N1 -- what happens on industrial pig farms is of direct concern to human beings, those who eat pork and those who don't.</p>
<p>When I asked the Public Health Agency of Canada about possible connections between pig farms and the H1N1 pandemic, I was directed to the Canada Food Inspection Agency. As far as public-message creation goes, what happens on farms is an agricultural issue, not a public-health issue.</p>
<p>I wonder how much of that is because of the thin skins of big pork producers. We're not even supposed to say "swine flu" any more, lest the industry get offended.</p>
<p>The industry needs to be part of this conversation, as do consumers, politicians and public-health officials. As Brown emphasizes, it isn't very helpful to self-righteously criticize the big bad agriculture industry for raising pigs in a way that maximizes profit. Consumers like paying low prices for meat. If they want pigs to be raised on less crowded farms, with fewer opportunities for the spread of new strains of flu, consumers will have to insist on that and be willing to pay more.</p>
<p>But first, consumers have to be aware that there are risk factors associated with large, dense pig farms. That means that politicians and public-health officials have to get over this bizarre form of political correctness that has made any questioning of industrial agriculture strictly taboo.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Experts rap WHO's flu rating scale</b>
</div><div>Mohammed Adam </div>

</p>
<p>Canadian infectious disease experts say the H1N1 outbreak shows the World Health Organization's pandemic-alert system is a failure, as it doesn't show "actual danger."</p>
<p>WHO's alert system determines when a flu outbreak or epidemic has turned into a worldwide pandemic, and allows governments and public health agencies to respond appropriately to protect people.</p>
<p>But Dr. Brian Ward and Dr. Michael Libman, both of McGill University in Montreal, said H1N1, formerly known as swine flu, has exposed a major weakness in the rating system that must be fixed: the failure to articulate a real sense of the gravity of the flu outbreak, and how much of a public danger it really is.</p>
<p>"All the WHO criteria were based on spread and geography without any indication of severity ... and what happened was that they were caught with an inadequate system of classification," said Ward, associate director of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre.</p>
<p>Libman agreed, saying there was growing recognition among experts that some changes have to be made.</p>
<p>"To be useful, the rating has to have relevance to the actual danger that is present," said Libman, director of the division of infectious diseases at McGill.</p>
<p>WHO's alert system rates the threat of pandemics on a scale of one to six.</p>
<p>Level 1 indicates normalcy, while Level 2 shows a virus circulating among animals that are known to have infected people and therefore poses a potential pandemic threat. Level 6 signals a global pandemic, with sustained human-to-human transmission over many countries and continents.</p>
<p>Declaring a pandemic is a serious step, because it says that the world is on the brink of a catastrophic health emergency that could cost millions of lives. When people think of a pandemic, it conjures up images of global calamities like the Black Death or Spanish Flu -- and in response, the headlines scream catastrophe.</p>
<p>So when WHO officials declared the H1N1 pandemic in June following the swine flu outbreak in Mexico in April, that's exactly what happened -- the world reacted with a sense of foreboding.</p>
<p>In reality, pandemic declarations are based on a geographical spread of the virus across several continents -- not its deadliness.</p>
<p>But that fact was lost on the public. Unable to make sense of a pandemic that for the most part turned out to be no worse than the common flu, many people began to question whether H1N1 really poses any serious danger.</p>
<p>Ward and Libman acknowledge that part of the confusion lies with the WHO rating system.</p>
<p>Ward said a new, "modulated" classification that also assesses the severity of pandemics, and includes it in the overall rating, might be more useful in avoiding unnecessary panic.</p>

<p>The Canadian government should donate any surplus swine flu vaccine to poorer countries, say ethicists and medical specialists who are warning that a "me-first" mentality among rich countries will doom efforts to combat the global pandemic.</p>
<p>They say Canada and other wealthy countries should follow the lead of GlaxoSmithKline Inc. and <span class="companylink">Sanofi-Aventis</span>, two of the world's major vaccine manufacturers. In response to an appeal from the World Health Organization, those companies plan to donate at least of 150 million doses of H1N1 vaccine for distribution in the developing world.</p>

<p>Don't wait until H1N1 influenza finds your family, says Vancouver Island Health Authority's chief medical health officer, Richard Stanwick. Start preparing now to reduce any impact on your family.</p>
<p>What's not known is when--and to what degree -- the H1N1 pandemic will hit. The return to school could see a spike in flu cases ahead of the usual mid-winter flu season, according to Stanwick.</p>
<p>"Kids are the prime reason for the spread of a virus through the community," says Stanwick, both a pediatrician and epidemiologist.</p>
<p>Coughing kids spread viruses among themselves and then take them home to potentially infect parents. This is one argument for first immunizing school kids and their parents to stall the spread of H1N1. Usually, immunization programs first target the very old and very young, chronically ill, pregnant women and health-care workers, he says.</p>
<p>"People who are sick need to stay home. You don't have to be there. Cemeteries are filled with irreplaceable people," Stanwick says. This not only applies to work or school, but family visits, playdates and community events.</p>
<p>Your family's best defence against H1N1 is to stay healthy, he says. This includes the obvious--eat right, get enough sleep and exercise. "If people need a reason to stop smoking, this is it," he adds.</p>
<p>The key to combating any flu is frequent hand-washing, Stanwick adds.</p>
<p>Viruses can last on an unwashed hand for minutes and hard surfaces for hours. Inadvertently touching your eyes or nose introduces the virus to your body.</p>
<p>Use soap and water or a hand sanitizer for 20 seconds--a good gauge is as long as it takes to sing Happy Birthday, he says. For example, parents using public transit can carry alcohol gel packs or wipes when wall-sanitizers or soap and water are not handy.</p>
<p>Avoid coughing into the bare hand. Use a handkerchief. A better alternative, according to Stanwick, is coughing into the crook of your arm--an area less likely to be in contact with others or your own eyes or nose.</p>
<p>Now is the time to stockpile household cleaning supplies and a seven-day supply of non-perishable food, Stanwick says. Renew any prescriptions early.</p>
<p>There could be shortages during a flu crisis. Parents--sick themselves or home with a sick child--might be unable to leave the house to shop.</p>
<p>Further, he says, now is also the time to set up online banking to avoid unnecessary outings.</p>
<p>Plan for alternatives for child care, Stanwick says. Decide which working parent's medical plan is the most amenable to staying home with a sick family member. Also, if possible, arrange now with your employer to work from home to avoid exposure or to care for a family member.</p>
<p>Think twice before booking the family's spring break holiday, Stanwick says.</p>
<p>"It's a bit of a risk. We don't know how other countries will respond," he says.</p>
<p>In a virulent outbreak, other countries might close their borders or confine visitors to their hotels, Stanwick says. Buy cancellation insurance if booking a trip now for what could well be the height of the flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Ultimately, surviving the flu pandemic requires a "collective effort," he says. This means neighbours should plan ahead to assist each other as needed during a flu pandemic, as with any disaster such as an earthquake.</p>
<p>"It's your neighbour who's going to dig you out, not the fire and police," Stanwick says.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>HOW TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FLU</p>
<p>-Wash hands often with soap and warm water or use a hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>-cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing. cough or sneeze into your sleeve.</p>
<p>-refrain from touching eyes, nose.</p>
<p>-eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>-Get lots of sleep and exercise.</p>
<p>-Get an annual flu shot and an h1n1 one when available.</p>
<p>-Stay home if you are sick or feel unwell.</p>
<p>-avoid crowds. Start buying now:</p>
<p>-non-perishable food items, such as canned or frozen soups, juices, fruits and vegetables; canned fish; crackers; peanut butter</p>
<p>-household cleaning supplies, such as bleach or disinfectant, dishwashing soap and paper towels.</p>
<p>-Basic over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (tylenol or tempra) for fever. no aspirin for those under 19 years.</p>
<p>-Prescription medications (two to three months' supply, if possible).</p>

<p>Colombian President Alvaro Uribe has the swine flu but is doing well, his spokesman said Sunday, just days after the leader returned from a regional summit in Argentina.</p>
<p>Deaths from swine flu in Latin America--the worst-hit region in the world-- rose to over 1,300 this month.</p>
<p>Uribe, a conservative staunch U. S. ally, began to suffer from symptoms of the flu on Saturday after returning from a summit meeting in Argentina, so he had a checkup which confirmed he had the A(H1N1) virus, according to a statement read out by his spokesman Cesar Velasquez.</p>
<p>"The president is continuing to work, and he will be in quarantine for some time as he recovers," the statement added, noting that Uribe was doing well and was working out of his ranch in Rionegro, in the country's northwest.</p>
<p>Velasquez also said Uribe's office sent a message to governments of other countries that took part in the summit in Bariloche, Argentina, to see if anyone else had taken ill. "All the people and government leaders who have had close contact with the president are being informed," the spokesman added.</p>
<p>To date 34 people have died of the flu in Colombia, official data show.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Olympic organizers don't expect major outbreak</b>

</p>
<p>Fears that the H1N1 virus will take a deadly swipe through the spectator stands or the athletes village during the 2010 Olympic Games aren't likely to be realized.</p>
<p>More likely, the virus will be felt in smaller ways: the absence of an athlete here, a cluster of fevers and chills there and a little paranoia among those with coughs and fevers.</p>
<p>For countries such as Canada-- whose potential medallists are concentrated in a few sports--swine flu could also have a disastrous effect on the standings if it sweeps through a team.</p>
<p>Podium Canada chief executive Roger Jackson made that point earlier this year when he noted the effect speedskater Cindy Klassen had on Canada's medal count--third overall with 24--at the 2006 Olympics in Turin.</p>
<p>"People don't remember that one gal won five of our medals," he said of Klassen. "And if she'd had a cold during the Games, we'd have been sixth or seventh."</p>
<p>And if she'd had H1N1 and passed it along to Kristina Groves or Deny Morrison or other members of the speedskating team, Canada could have dropped even further in the standings.</p>
<p>Health professionals for months have been trying to ratchet down the fear people have about contracting and dying from swine flu. They've pointed out that the pathology of the pandemic is now showing itself to be--for most people, at least--a nasty, but not particularly dangerous, disease.</p>
<p>And they point out that in Canada, where an average of 4,500 people die annually from seasonal flu symptoms, the H1N1 virus has killed just four people.</p>
<p>Medical officials overseeing the 2010 Winter Games say they're not taking the virus lightly, but they also don't believe it will be necessary or even wise to shut down the Games or close events to spectators in the event of a fresh outbreak.</p>
<p>"I think influenza is an infection that we should always respect. But the last time we had a flu pandemic, in 1968, there were two Olympic Games," said Dr. Reka Gustafson, the medical director of communicable disease control for the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority.</p>
<p>"It's important to remember that H1N1 is behaving like a seasonal influenza virus, albeit one for which a separate vaccine is being developed."</p>
<p>Gustafson's boss, health authority chief medical officer Dr. Patricia Daly, said recently she disagrees with closing schools or public assemblies, even though the World Health Organization has declared the flu a pandemic.</p>
<p>"I can tell you right now, there is not a lot of evidence they are of any benefit. We have no plans to do any of those things for H1N1. We will not be cancelling any of the Olympic events as a result of the pandemic," she said.</p>
<p>"We just don't think the spectrum of illness warrants those kinds of draconian measures."</p>
<p>Health officials are more inclined to study the potential effects of an H1N1 outbreak in Vancouver than they are to come up with plans to close borders, doors or events.</p>
<p>In May, the B.C. Environmental and Occupational Health Research Network sponsored a symposium for 90 institution-based scientists to discuss a dozen research projects they want to conduct around the 2010 Games, including the effect of H1N1 at mass events.</p>
<p>"I tell athletes that the Olympics is where the viruses of the world meet," said Dr. Bob McCormack, the chief medical officer for the Canadian Olympic Committee.</p>
<p>McCormack said the COC has regularly advised athletes to get vaccinations for seasonal flu, and expects to repeat the advice when the H1N1 vaccine is produced later this year.</p>
<p>But standard preventive efforts such as handwashing and "not coughing into your hand and then offering to shake someone else's" are still more effective, he said.</p>
<p>McCormack said the COC has developed a comprehensive strategy for dealing with H1N1 during the Vancouver Games, but he wanted to first share it with administrators and team officials at a meeting in Vancouver next month.</p>
<p>Much of that nuts-and-bolts strategy deals with how to lessen the chance of an infection sweeping through an entire team, and what to do when an athlete is suspected of contracting the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>For its part, the Vancouver Olympic Organizing Committee says it plans to acquire and offer H1N1 vaccinations to volunteers and staff later this year.</p>
<p>Dr. Jack Taunton, VANOC's chief medical officer, said the committee has already secured enough doses of the seasonal flu vaccine Tamiflu for its paid staff and 25,000 volunteers. He said it's up to coaches and officials of visiting teams to vaccinate their athletes.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Leagues keep watchful eye on H1N1; Mexican sports were hit hard in spring</b>
</div><div>Ken Warren   </div>
<div>Ottawa Citizen; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>861 words</div><div>31 August 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>C4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>When the H1N1 virus first appeared in Mexico in April, professional soccer leagues there reacted quickly and dramatically to avoid a quick escalation in the number of cases.</p>
<p>Nearly 200 Mexican League games were played in empty stadiums.</p>
<p>CONCACAF, soccer's governing body, cancelled an under-17 tournament. The Nationwide Golf Tour, one step below the PGA, cancelled the Mexico Open tournament, which was originally scheduled for late May.</p>
<p>This cautious approach spread across the border to the southern United States, where many high schools either cancelled or postponed games and track meets.</p>
<p>An official with the Mexican soccer club Pachua put it best: "Unfortunately, it's very sad to see the stadium like this--but the most important things are human lives."</p>
<p>The comment certainly puts professional sports in perspective.</p>
<p>It also gives us pause to consider how North America's major professional leagues will deal with the second wave of the virus that most health experts are predicting will come this fall and winter.</p>
<p>How serious would the crisis have to be for the National Hockey League to tell its teams to play without fans in the seats?How severe would the crisis level be for the NHL to cancel games outright? Would the NHL, National Football League, Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association balk at giving up billions in potential revenues because of health concerns?</p>
<p>At this point, the sports world is operating on a business-as-usual schedule, while keeping a cautious eye on how a second wave of the virus might develop.</p>
<p>Texas Rangers pitcher Vicente Padilla was diagnosed with the H1N1 virus in late July--believed to be the first athlete on a major pro team to test positive -- but it passed as quickly as any other flu might have, meaning he only missed a few days of action. Accordingly, there were no major concerns around the majors.</p>
<p>NHL officials haven't yet made any major changes to how they operate.</p>
<p>"It has been a situation that we continue to monitor," said Gary Meagher, the NHL's senior vice-president of public relations.</p>
<p>Likewise, teams such as the Ottawa Senators aren't doing anything differently.</p>
<p>"Internally, we have certainly advised staff that if they're sick, don't come to work," said Tom Conroy, vice-president and executive director at Ottawa's Scotiabank Place.</p>
<p>"We have hand sanitizers in all our staff offices and staff washrooms. You would expect that people who are not feeling well would stay at home (from games), but at this point, we don't have a plan to have a public announcement on that."</p>
<p>That doesn't mean Senators doctors take the H1N1 virus lightly.</p>
<p>"From a sports perspective, whenever you have teams coming together and there's a concern about a potential epidemic or pandemic, it's obviously a concern," said Dr. Mark Aubry, the Senators' team physician and chief medical officer for the International Ice Hockey Federation.</p>
<p>Aubry, who was at the world hockey championship in Switzerland last spring when H1N1 cases first appeared in Mexico, says all 16 teams followed the guidelines set out by the World Health Organization and local public health associations.</p>
<p>"We took all the necessary precautionary measures, including lots of hand-washing," said Aubry. "We didn't forgo the handshaking routine (after games), because there was very little concern, very few cases, in Switzerland at the time."</p>
<p>Aubry says the IIHF will not hesitate to cancel events if that's the recommendation from the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>"We monitor it, we watch it," he said. "We talk about it and we'll see where it goes. We have cancelled events before. When SARS happened (in 2003), we cancelled the world women's championships in China. I was part of the discussions that went on. It was only three or four days before the championships were supposed to begin that we cancelled it."</p>
<p>If and when a flu shot for the H1N1 virus is available, NHL players will be encouraged to get it, but teams don't have the power to make it mandatory.</p>
<p>NHL players constantly fly because of their travel schedule, but Aubry says that doesn't make them any more likely to catch the virus than the general population.</p>
<p>"Most of the time, when you're talking about influenza, it usually affects the population which is at the most risk, the people whose immune system is at risk, but with the H1N1 virus, initially in the beginning, it was affecting so called 'normal, healthy' people," he said.</p>
<p>"But as we have gone down the road, very few people have died and most of the people who have been affected are the very young or the very old, who can't fend for themselves as well. There's no recipe. We just have to follow the recommendations from the health organizations."</p>

<p>Of course salaries make up 70 per cent of health-care costs in Alberta. Health care is a human resources-intensive endeavour. It cannot be accomplished by machines, since there is no replacement for human intellect. Anyone who doesn't understand that concept knows little or nothing about health care.</p>
<p>The notion that offering early retirement to health-care professionals to save money is short-sighted. And to believe that it might even be remotely possible to improve access to a service while reducing the human resources providing the nuts and bolts of that service is pure folly. One person can only do so much and cannot be in two places at once.</p>
<p>Should H1N1 influenza sicken significant numbers of people, the capacity of the system will be overwhelmed. Albertans should prepare for much longer waits for health-care services. That's what is coming.</p>

<p>This Alberta government is like a deer in the headlights hobbling (a world economic recession is hanging onto its back legs) toward a very large truck (H1N1). Besides all the issues of lack of planning during the good times, what part of the pending H1N1 pandemic does this government not get?</p>
<p>The Alberta government has made a special financial deal with doctors. Unfortunately, the nurses who could fill the gap in giving the flu shot, are instead being asked to retire.</p>
<p>I guess when we close schools during the pandemic, the government will be able to "encourage" teachers to take unpaid holidays.</p>
<p>Wake up, government of Alberta, and smell the potential disaster we will be facing this fall.</p>

<p>Alberta is scrambling to deal with the world recession and provincial budget deficit. Contradictions abound. Side by side with cuts to seniors' care, delisting of needed procedures, the partial closing of Alberta Hospital, and a proposed 13-per-cent decrease in spending for health care, is the looming pandemic which is predicted to overwhelm our capacity.</p>
<p>Recently, it was proposed that retired health-care workers be drafted back into service to fight the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute opened a year late because not enough staff could be hired.</p>
<p>Now, we are told that health-care workers are being offered early retirement, and if that doesn't produce the desired reductions, layoffs will follow. We are asked to believe that these reductions will result in better care.</p>
<p>The proposed changes to the care of the mentally ill are particularly callous. Many patients do not have family, friends, or MLAs to advocate for them. Nonetheless, society cares deeply about their plight and should hold the government accountable when homelessness and incidents of crime increase. Alberta Hospital provides the best care for acute illness, by creating a controlled environment where doctors and specially trained nurses can stabilize patients through medication and therapy. Group homes and voluntary walk-in programs are essential parts of the safety net, but cannot substitute for hospital care. Workers in group homes have only six weeks of formal training before they are assigned work alone or in teams with six or more residents.</p>
<p>Alberta must revisit its priorities: The welfare of the people comes first.</p>
<p>Regardless of the budget deficit or the economy, Alberta has a large and growing population which requires a constant level of quality medical services.</p>
<p>In recession, people can postpone vacations and restaurant meals, but when illness or injury strikes, there is no way to postpone care. Downsizing health care to fit the budget will result in lives ruined and lost.</p>
<p>We did not intend to elect such a calculating, heartless government.</p>

<p>Wow. The perfect solution, eh?Lay off doctors and nurses. Why hasn't anyone thought of that before? I mean, we've all been trying to think of ways to help this government, because it desperately needs some intellectual assistance.</p>
<p>The idea is brilliant. Lay off the trained professionals. Then there won't be enough of them to help those of us who need them. So we'll die, and then we won't need so many doctors and nurses. And Alberta will have a new advantage.</p>

<p>This is a great time to hop on a plane to somewhere, experts tell us. Just wash your hands along the way.</p>
<p>Sure, there are hazards abroad, they say--malaria, hepatitis, political mayhem. But the H1N1 flu is not among the big threats.</p>
<p>One cheerful travel medicine expert this summer, despite all the questions he's fielding about flu, is Dr. David Colby. He runs a travel medicine clinic in London, Ont., teaches medicine at the University of Western Ontario, and serves as acting medical officer of health for Chatham-Kent. He's often asked: Swwhould people delay their trips until after the flu pandemic?</p>
<p>"Absolutely not. This flu is incredibly mild. It has a lower mortality than our regular seasonal influenza, so I wouldn't let this dissuade me from travelling anywhere."</p>
<p>Even to Mexico, where H1N1 began?</p>
<p>"Sure. It (the number of deaths there) still wasn't very high. It was higher, and we don't know why, but there seem to have been pockets of influenza that have struck particularly unhealthy people. They are never going to do as well (with the flu), but if you're healthy enough to travel, you're going to be fine."</p>
<p>Another leading travel medicine expert shares this view. Dr. Shariq Haider runs the international health and tropical medicine clinic at Mc-Master University Medical Centre in Hamilton, and teaches medicine at the university.</p>
<p>"There are no travel advisories (government health warnings about flu) at present to any international location...and I don't believe one has to alter their international plans," he said.</p>
<p>He added that travellers should "certainly exercise common-sense preventive measures," such as hand-washing while abroad, and stay home if they suspect they have the flu, as suggested by the Public Health Agency of Canada. But it's still safe to travel.</p>
<p>As well, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that H1N1 has spread from person to person less effectively than other flu viruses. The H1N1 strain attaches inefficiently to cells in the human respiratory tract, the team from CDC and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported in the July 2 online edition of Science.</p>
<p>But viruses can mutate fast, so a poor ability to spread today doesn't guarantee that the virus will behave that way next winter, they note.</p>
<p>They say their genetic analysis confirms that the virus doesn't spread as easily as many flu bugs. Most outbreaks have occurred in limited clusters, sometimes within a family or a school, but not spreading much beyond that.</p>
<p>Still, flu happens. One thing to consider: It's not just an inconvenience. Your liberty could be affected by some countries' governments.</p>
<p>China has routinely quarantined travellers this summer after checking their temperatures at the airport. Some had flu; others were simply travelling in groups where one person became ill. By late July, the U.S. embassy in Beijing reported 1,800 Americans had been detained -- only 200 of whom were actually sick. Also in late July, the British government announced it had provided assistance to 160 Britons quarantined in China, Singapore, India and Egypt.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has announced it will soon require a health certificate for all pilgrims to Mecca, showing they have had flu shots. (There is some question about how effective this will be, since these shots would have to be ordinary "seasonal" flu vaccine; the vaccine for H1N1 has not been fully tested yet and is not available commercially.)</p>
<p>Iran has banned its citizens from the annual Mecca pilgrimage.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn't tell travellers how to avoid flu abroad, noting that the bug is all over the United States anyway. It counsels people with flu-like symptoms not to travel, or, if they're already abroad, to cover their sneezes, wash often, and stay in their hotel rooms.</p>
<p>But Colby does sound a warning for travellers planning a cruise.</p>
<p>"Influenza can spread very rapidly in cruise ships and can put all the vulnerable people flat on their backs for several days."</p>
<p>He recommends a flu shot before going on a cruise.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>Tips</p>
<p>-Wash your hands frequently. Carry alcohol-based hand gel in case soap and water aren't available. - Monitor the Public Health Agency of Canada website ( www.phacaspc.gc.ca)and[http://www.phacaspc.gc.ca)and] the World Health Organization website (www.who[http://www.who]. int) for updates. -If you are ill with an acute respiratory illness either before you leave Canada or while abroad, you should delay your travel.</p>
<p>-See your health-care provider before you travel to discuss vaccines, the H1N1 flu virus situation in your destination, whether you are at risk of severe illness from influenza and if you should get a seasonal flu shot.</p>
<p>-If you develop symptoms of flu while travelling stay in your accommodations and avoid contact with others until seven days have passed since symptoms started. If you must go out, wear a face mask to reduce the risk of spreading the virus. Access to adequate medical care abroad may be limited and you may be quarantined.</p>
<p>-A list of physicians can be obtained through the nearest Canadian Embassy or consulate. - A list of Canadian government offices abroad can be accessed through www.voyage.gc.ca.-Should[http://www.voyage.gc.ca.-Should] your symptoms worsen, call your health-care provider or urgent-care facility before seeking medical attention, to inform them of your symptoms and your recent travel history.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Public Health Agency ready for second wave; Comprehensive pandemic plan was prepared in response to 2003 SARS outbreak</b>
</div><div>Andrew Mayeda   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>985 words</div><div>31 August 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>When the second wave of the swine-flu outbreak lands this fall, Canadian public-health officials will be armed with a national pandemic plan that's been years in the making.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada, created in the wake of the SARS outbreak in 2003, has drafted a 550-page national pandemic influenza plan that makes recommendations on everything from how doctors should diagnose the virus and how researchers should collect and test lab samples to what temperature should be maintained at temporary morgues.</p>
<p>But critics say crucial parts of the plan remain vague. In a recent editorial, the Canadian Medical Association Journal called for a greater "sense of urgency" about the second wave of the outbreak, and made a number of proposals to improve Canada's response, including the appointment of an independent national public-health "czar."</p>
<p>The easiest way to create such a position, according to the CMAJ, would be to expand the powers of Canada's chief public-health officer. Currently, the chief public-health officer largely plays an advisory role to the federal health minister, as well as provincial health authorities and the public. But in a pandemic, Canada needs someone in charge who has the independence to rise above politics, and the authority to compel the provinces to take action, said CMAJ editor-in-chief Paul Hebert.</p>
<p>"First and foremost, you need an authority figure to manage the crisis, like in any crisis. You need a general," Hebert said in an interview.</p>
<p>PHAC insists it has the situation under control. "Well, I don't know whether it's because it's like a duck and the legs going under the water a lot faster than you see them moving smoothing along the surface, but there's an incredible amount of work going on," Chief Public Health Officer David Butler-Jones told the House of Common health committee earlier this month.</p>
<p>More details about the pandemic plan should become clear next month. On Sept. 2-3, Butler-Jones will meet in Winnipeg with provincial public-health officials, intensive-care specialists and medical experts. Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq will meet with the provincial and territorial health ministers on Sept. 18. Here's what we know so far:</p>
<p>Will there be enough drugs?</p>
<p>Under a long-term contract with drug giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> (GSK), Canada has reserved enough vaccine to immunize the entire population. The federal government has ordered 50.4 million doses of the swine-flu vaccine at a cost of more than $400 million, of which Ottawa will pay 60 per cent, with the provinces covering the rest.</p>
<p>But concerns are growing the vaccine won't be ready in time. The government has said it will be available in November, but some experts predict the outbreak could be in full swing by then.</p>
<p>Clinical trials have already begun in Australia, and the United States plans to start testing later this month. By contrast, PHAC hopes to begin clinical trials by late September or early October.</p>
<p>"It's coming a little late, to be honest, because the first peak sounds like it will be in November-December. Ideally, you'd want to vaccinate six weeks ahead of that," said Hebert.</p>
<p>Until the vaccine is ready, health authorities hope the use of antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu will keep the virus at bay. The government has a stockpile of more than 50 million doses of antivirals, but that wouldn't be enough to treat the entire population, since several doses are prescribed with every treatment.</p>
<p>Will there be enough beds?</p>
<p>PHAC estimates a pandemic could cause 15 to 35 per cent of the population to fall clinically ill, requiring the hospitalization of 34,000 to 138,000 people. Officials say such volumes could overwhelm hospitals and put the health-care system under stress.</p>
<p>"It wouldn't take much, given the way it's affecting people, to overwhelm the system," said Hebert, noting the virus appears to affect fewer people than the seasonal flu, but in a more "devastating" way. "It's becoming an ICU epidemic."</p>
<p>As the pandemic progresses, federal authorities could recommend calling up retired or part-time health-care workers, as well as volunteers from organizations like the Red Cross.</p>
<p>The pandemic plan recommends a number of strategies to make room for flu patients, such as cutting down on non-critical surgeries, encouraging residential care, or moving non-flu patients to extended-care or psychiatric facilities.</p>
<p>What will be shut down?</p>
<p>For the moment, PHAC says "proactive" school closures aren't necessary, given the economic and social costs that would trigger. Local school boards will make the call on whether to close individual schools if an outbreak hits.</p>
<p>The national pandemic plan notes Ottawa has the power to declare a Public Welfare Emergency under the Emergencies Act, the successor to the War Measures Act.</p>
<p>Once such a national emergency is declared, the federal government could effectively shut down schools, ban public events and assume control of emergency rooms. But the plan notes that it is unlikely that Ottawa would use the Emergencies Act.</p>
<p>Who's spreading the word?</p>
<p>The National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, along with public health labs in each province and territory, will monitor the outbreak as it unfolds.</p>
<p>The labs will likely focus on tracking the geographic spread of the disease, as well as the effectiveness of antivirals and the vaccine.</p>
<p>PHAC has launched a website called fightflu.cato provide updates and information to the public.</p>

<p>ITALY REPELS MIGRANT BOAT</p>
<p>ROME Italian coastguards on Sunday turned back a boatload of 75 migrants off the coast of the island of Sicily, news agency ANSA reported.</p>
<p>The migrants, thought to be Somali, were travelling in a rubber dingy which was intercepted by coastguards around 44 kilometres from the shores of the Italian island.</p>
<p>The group, which included 15 women and three children, was transferred to an Italian police patrol boat and sent back immediately for Libya.</p>
<p>One of the migrants was taken to a Sicilian hospital to be treated for broken ribs.</p>
<p>They were the latest group of migrants to be stopped on the approach to Italy and sent back to the north African country since Tripoli and Rome reached a controversial agreement earlier this year.</p>
<p>Under the accord, Libya has agreed take back migrants leaving from its shores and heading to Italy illegally.</p>
<p>According to an estimate by news agency ANSA, around 1,000 migrants have been sent back to Libya by Italy since the agreement was reached.</p>
<p>The UN refugee agency said it was thought the migrants were from Somalia, where Islamist rebels are waging a fierce campaign against the government.</p>
<p>VERA LYNN RETURNS TO BRITISH TOP 20</p>
<p>LONDON Dame Vera Lynn, the "sweetheart" of the armed forces during the Second World War, became on Sunday the oldest living artist to reach the top 20 of Britain's album charts, her record company said.</p>
<p>Lynn, who kept up the spirits of millions with her songs and personality during the darkest days of the war, entered the charts at number 20, at the age of 92.</p>
<p>Her album, We'll Meet Again -- The Very Best of Vera Lynn, returned her to the charts decades after she topped them in the 1950s.</p>
<p>"I am extremely excited and delighted to be back in the charts after all these years," she said.</p>
<p>Her album overtook those of comparative youngsters U2, the Stone Roses, Green Day and Eminem.</p>
<p>The album was released to coincide with this week's 70-year anniversary of the declaration of the Second World War.</p>
<p>BRITISH MATADOR, 67, RETURNS TO RING</p>
<p>BENALMADENA, Spain A 67-year-old former butcher from Britain made his comeback as a top-flight matador in Spain Sunday, defying not only age but heart and knee problems that forced him to retire four years ago.</p>
<p>Frank Evans, known in Spain simply as El Ingles, successfully killed two bulls of around 500 kilograms with a final sword thrust, after assistants known as picadors, one of them on horseback, had speared the animals in the shoulder to weaken them.</p>
<p>He was cheered by the 300 or so spectators in the small bullring in Benalmadena near Malaga in southern Spain, many of them British holiday-makers, and carried out on the shoulders of his colleagues.</p>
<p>"I'm back in the swim now, I'm back as an active matador," a beaming Evans said afterwards.</p>
<p>MERKEL SUFFERS ELECTION SETBACK</p>
<p>BERLIN German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party suffered a setback Sunday a month before general elections, with preliminary results indicating it will lose control in two states.</p>
<p>Merkel's Christian Democratic Union held onto power in the eastern state of Saxony but appeared to see its ruling majorities slip away in neighbouring Thuringia and Saarland on the French border.</p>
<p>But the results, largely expected, seemed unlikely to knock Merkel off course in her drive to win a second term in the Sept. 27 vote, with the CDU enjoying around a 15-point poll lead on the the rival Social Democrats.</p>
<p>An overwhelming 87 per cent of Germans expect Merkel to win, according to a new survey from pollsters Emnid published on Sunday, with just nine per cent predicting victory for the SPD's candidate Frank-Walter Steinmeier.</p>
<p>DAILY ASPIRIN MAY BE DANGEROUS</p>
<p>Barcelona Healthy people who take aspirin to prevent a heart attack are doing themselves more harm than good, researchers said Sunday.</p>
<p>Millions of people take a daily dose of the drug in the belief it will help to keep them healthy.</p>
<p>But at a conference for leading doctors, British scientists said they had found that taking aspirin does not significantly reduce the risk of a heart attack for healthy people. They also found that it almost doubles the risk of being admitted to hospital because of internal bleeding.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that, for otherwise healthy people, the risks of taking aspirin outweigh the benefits. The doctors stressed that patients who had already suffered a heart attack should continue to take the drug.</p>
<p>The results of a study carried out in Scotland and presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Barcelona have added to the growing evidence that the risks outweigh the benefits for healthy people.</p>
<p>Prof. Gerry Fowkes, of the Wolfson Unit for Prevention of Peripheral Vascular Disease in Edinburgh, said: "Aspirin probably leads to a minor reduction in future events but the problem is that has to be weighed against an increase in bleeding. Some of that bleeding can be quite serious and lead to death."</p>
<p>SOUTH AMERICA</p>
<p>PRESIDENT URIBE HAS SWINE FLU</p>
<p>BOGOTA Colombian President Alvaro Uribe has the swine flu but is doing well, his spokesman said Sunday, just days after the leader returned from a regional summit in Argentina.</p>
<p>Deaths from swine flu in Latin America -- the worst-hit region in the world -- rose to over 1,300 this month.</p>
<p>Uribe, a conservative staunch U.S. ally, began to suffer from symptoms of the flu on Saturday after returning from a summit meeting in Argentina, so he had a checkup which confirmed he had the A(H1N1) virus, according to a statement read out by his spokesman Cesar Velasquez.</p>
<p>"The president is continuing to work, and he will be in quarantine for some time as he recovers," the statement added, noting that Uribe was doing well and was working out of his ranch in Rionegro, in the country's northwest.</p>
<p>Velasquez also said Uribe's office sent a message to governments of other countries that took part in the summit in Bariloche, Argentina, to see if anyone else had taken ill.</p>
<p>"All the people and government leaders who have had close contact with the president are being informed," the spokesman added.</p>
<p>ASIA</p>
<p>PAKISTAN MILITARY KILLS 30 MILITANTS</p>
<p>PESHAWAR Pakistani attack helicopters have shelled militant hideouts in the northwestern Swat district, killing 30 rebels, the military said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The operation that began on Saturday evening in different parts of the Swat town of Charbagh continued on Sunday with participation of ground troops.</p>
<p>"The attack helicopters shelled militant hideouts during the operation, killing 30 rebels," the military said in a statement.</p>
<p>One soldier was killed in the operation.</p>
<p>Separately, a suicide attack in the main town in Pakistan's northwestern Swat valley Sunday killed 14 police cadets, an attack that Swat police chief Qazi Ghulam Farooq blamed on Taliban militants.</p>
<p>The suicide bomber entered the police training ground and blew himself up near the recruits.</p>
<p>Pakistan in April launched a punishing military offensive against the Taliban in the northwest, targeting the rebels in the districts of Swat, Buner and Lower Dir after the militants advanced closer to the capital Islamabad.</p>
<p>The military push forced 1.9 million civilians from their homes, most seeking refuge with relatives and the rest crowding into refugee camps, creating a humanitarian crisis for impoverished Pakistan.</p>
<p>Last month, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani announced that the military had "eliminated" extremists in the northwest and according to government and UN statistics 1.6 million displaced people have returned home.</p>
<p>INDIA LOSES CONTACT WITH MOON PROBE</p>
<p>BANGALORE India has lost all contact with an unmanned spacecraft conducting its first moon mission, the national space agency said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Communications with the Chandrayaan-1 craft broke down early on Saturday. "It is a serious problem. If we do not re-establish contact we will lose the spacecraft," said S. Satish, spokesman for the <span class="companylink">Indian Space Research</span> Organization.</p>
<p>The $79-million mission was launched amid national euphoria last October, putting India in the Asian space race alongside rival China, reinforcing its claim to be considered a global power.</p>
<p>A probe vehicle landed on the moon a month later and sent back images of the lunar surface.</p>
<p>But a critical sensor in the main craft, orbiting the moon, malfunctioned in July, raising fears that the two-year mission may have to be curtailed.</p>
<p>One of the mission's main aims was to look for Helium 3, an isotope which is very rare on earth but could be an energy source in the future in nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>ISRO has plans to send a manned mission to space in four years' time and eventually on to Mars.</p>
<p>MYANMAR SAYS 34 KILLED NEAR BORDER</p>
<p>YANGON Myanmar's junta-run television announced Sunday that 26 state security personnel and eight ethnic rebel fighters had been killed in three days of clashes near the Chinese border.</p>
<p>The broadcast ended a news blackout on the unrest between the army and rebel Kokang forces in the country's remote northeast.</p>
<p>According to the United Nations the fighting has sent up to 30,000 refugees fleeing into China.</p>
<p>The announcement late Sunday said 15 of the junta's police and 11 soldiers were killed in battles in Kokang, a mainly ethnic Chinese region of Myanmar's Shan state, while 13 police and 34 military were injured.</p>
<p>It said the fighting, in which eight rebel fighters died, had now ceased and the government army had seized 640 of the opposition's weapons.</p>
<p>UKRAINIAN CREW PLEAD FOR HELP</p>
<p>NAIROBI The Ukrainian crew of a cargo ship held for more than three months by Somali pirates pleaded Sunday for authorities to speed up efforts to gain their release and urgently evacuate a female hostage.</p>
<p>"We are exhausted and desperate," the Ukrainian skipper of the MV Ariana, who gave his name only as Captain Voronov, told AFP by phone from the ship anchored off northern Somalia.</p>
<p>One of two female members of the 24-strong crew "risks death" without proper medical treatment, according to a Ukrainian doctor who spoke to her by phone from the Kenyan capital Nairobi.</p>
<p>The tearful young woman pleaded for help in the phone call, said the doctor, who said she ran the risk of generalized infection due to a gynecological condition.</p>
<p>The pirates have up to now refused to free the woman separately.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Maloway to NDP: Go slow - Says choice of leader to replace Doer shouldn't look like coronation</b>
</div><div>By Arielle Godbout </div>
<div>863 words</div><div>30 August 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>A long-serving former MLA urged the NDP not to rush into picking a new leader, two days before the party's Manitoba executive meets to hammer out the details of a leadership convention.</p>
<p>Jim Maloway, who served as the Elmwood MLA for close to 23 years before becoming the NDP MP for Elmwood-Transcona in 2008, was reacting to suggestions the NDP is under pressure to select Gary Doer's successor quickly after the premier announced his resignation Thursday.</p>
<p>Maloway said a later leadership convention -- he suggested a November date -- could give a much-needed boost to the party's membership, and stifle opposition criticism of a political coronation.</p>
<p>"This is the first time in Manitoba that the NDP is picking a leader who will automatically become premier," Maloway said.</p>
<p>That means the new premier may face questions from the opposition over whether he or she can legitimately run the province without having faced the voters as the party's leader.</p>
<p>"If you're going to avoid that question, why not make this as wide open as possible," he said, adding that a later convention could persuade more contenders to join the race.</p>
<p>The convention could also entice new members and old supporters who may have let their memberships slide, Maloway said.</p>
<p>The NDP uses a delegate system, in which the number of delegates a constituency sends depends on its members in good standing 30 days before the convention.</p>
<p>If the convention is held in mid-October -- which party officials have indicated is the earliest possible date logistically -- that leaves only a two-week window for new members to get in on the action.</p>
<p>Maloway went further, suggesting the party should reverse its 2007 decision to revert to the delegate system -- it had previously embraced the one-member, one-vote system that has proved popular with other parties.</p>
<p>"I think the public wants to see a legitimate, wide-open race and feel they have input into the selection."</p>
<p>He said he felt it was important to voice his concerns before Monday's meeting of the executive.</p>
<p>Lorraine Sigurdson, president of the Manitoba NDP, said she had not been contacted by Maloway regarding the issue.</p>
<p>However, she stressed the convention date was not set in stone, nor was it decided that an earlier convention is in the best interest of the party.</p>
<p>"We're not going to make a decision lightly," she said, adding the issues that would be discussed Monday were "momentous."</p>
<p>University of Manitoba political scientist Jared Wesley agreed that Doer's resignation is an incredible opportunity for growth in the party's membership.</p>
<p>"That's the only time a party picks up new numbers," he said of leadership conventions, adding that "party tourists" will often sign membership cards just to participate in the convention -- a phenomenon more popular with one-member, one-vote systems.</p>
<p>But, he said, there are convincing reasons why the NDP may want to slate the convention for the earliest possible date -- though "everyone in the party knows this can't look like a coronation ceremony."</p>
<p>The longer a party draws out a race, the more time the opposition has to dig up ammo on the candidates, Wesley said. It can also lead to bickering between contenders, though he pointed out that the province's NDP historically has fairly clean leadership races.</p>
<p>Wesley said the recovering economy and the predicted return of H1N1 influenza are other reasons the party might want to get the convention over and done with. "Nobody wants to be distracted when dealing with a pandemic," he said.</p>
<p>arielle.godbout@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Snap election a possibility</p>
<p>Could Premier Gary Doer's resignation spark a snap election?</p>
<p>It's possible, but unlikely.</p>
<p>Under the Elections Act, amended a year ago, Manitoba's fixed election date is Oct. 4, 2011.</p>
<p>But the act does not prevent the next NDP premier from asking Manitoba's Lieutenant-Governor Philip Lee to dissolve the legislature and call an election before that date.</p>
<p>Will the new NDP leader do that?</p>
<p>The act states a general election must be held on Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2011 unless a general election has been held between the time the bill became law and Oct. 3, 2011.</p>
<p>In the future, a general election must be held on the first Tuesday in October in the fourth calendar year after election day for the last general election.</p>
<p>The act also preserves the powers of the lieutenant-governor to dissolve the legislature at the his or her discretion.</p>
<p>Regardless of what the next NDP premier thinks about election timing, Tory Leader Hugh McFadyen said Friday Doer's resignation has put the Progressive Conservatives on election footing.</p>
<p>"I think it's prudent for us to be prepared for that possibility," he said.</p>
<p>"Everyone is looking with optimism with what's to come. There are going to be significant opportunities for us."</p>
<p>McFadyen also said the party is in the process of selecting candidates and he met with a handful of potential Tory MLAs Friday morning.</p>

</p>
<p>What are the symptoms of the new H1N1 swine flu virus?</p>
<p>Fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. A significant number of people also report diarrhea and vomiting.</p>
<p>What is the difference between ordinary seasonal flu and a flu pandemic?</p>
<p>The symptoms are the same, but they can be much more severe with a pandemic, which affects younger, healthy people who don't normally suffer as much from seasonal flu.</p>
<p>There are other differences:</p>
<p>- Seasonal flu happens every year, while a flu pandemic happens only two or three times a century.</p>
<p>- Seasonal flu usually occurs from November to April; a flu pandemic can come in two or three waves, with each wave lasting about two months.</p>
<p>- Most people who get seasonal flu recover within a few weeks; during a pandemic, more people who get the flu will recover more slowly.</p>
<p>- Seasonal flu is hardest on people who don't have strong immune systems (the very young, the very old and people with certain chronic illnesses); people of any age could become seriously ill with flu during a pandemic.</p>
<p>How do I know if I have the H1N1 virus or seasonal flu?</p>
<p>Without laboratory testing, it's difficult to know exactly what strain of flu a person has. Often, several strains of flu are circulating at the same time, and the symptoms are usually the same. Health-care providers are preparing this fall to assess and treat patients with all types of flu-like illness because health officials are no longer doing large-scale diagnostic tests to determine which types of flu people have. Only flu patients who are hospitalized will continue to be tested for H1N1.</p>
<p>How long can an infected person spread the H1N1 virus to others?</p>
<p>People infected with seasonal flu and H1N1 flu can infect others from one day before showing symptoms to seven days afterward.</p>
<p>Who is at risk of developing complications from the H1N1 virus?</p>
<p>As with seasonal flu, certain people who get H1N1 are at "high risk" of serious complications. This includes children younger than two, pregnant women and people of any age with certain chronic illnesses. In Canada, about 75 per cent of people who have died from complications linked to H1N1 have had one or more medical conditions. These include pregnancy, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, asthma and kidney disease, suppressed immune systems, neurocognitive and neuromuscular disorders.</p>
<p>One thing that makes H1N1 appear different than seasonal flu is that people over 65 do not seem to be at increased risk of complications. Laboratory studies by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control have shown that about one-third of adults older than 60 may have antibodies against the H1N1 virus, while those younger than 60 do not. To date, it's not known how much, if any, protection this antibody provides against H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>How does the new H1N1 flu compare to seasonal flu in severity and infection rates?</p>
<p>Like H1N1 flu, seasonal flu can cause mild to severe illness, and at times lead to death. According to the Ontario Ministry of Health, between three and six million Canadians get flu every year, and between 4,000 and 8,000 Canadians, mostly seniors, die from flu, pneumonia and other related complications. Of the estimated 60,000 who are hospitalized, the largest groups are children younger than two and people older than 65. To date, statistics show that H1N1 flu has caused a greater disease burden in people younger than 25. Meanwhile, relatively few cases and deaths have been reported in people older than 64, which is unusual when compared to the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Is the H1N1 virus more deadly than seasonal strains of flu?</p>
<p>Early estimates suggest the H1N1 virus is probably more deadly than seasonal flu viruses, but much less deadly than the pandemic virus that caused the Spanish flu of 1918. However, flu viruses mutate rapidly, and this virus could change in the coming months. The Spanish flu virus was mild when it first appeared in the spring of 1918, but when it returned the next winter, it killed 30 people for every 1,000 it infected.</p>
<p>In contrast, epidemiologists who analyzed April's H1N1 epidemic in Mexico recently reported that the estimated fatality rate of the H1N1 virus is four in 1,000, meaning this virus is considerably less lethal than the one that caused the 1918 pandemic, but somewhat more lethal than seasonal flu viruses, which have a fatality rate of two in 1,000.</p>
<p>How serious could the next wave of the H1N1 pandemic be?</p>
<p>Although it's impossible to predict how severe the pandemic could be, experts from the <span class="companylink">University of Pittsburgh Medical Center</span> believe it so far resembles the 1957-58 flu pandemic. Like the H1N1 virus, the 1957 pandemic virus circulated in the Northern Hemisphere during summer, while hitting the Southern Hemisphere during winter. Current disease patterns are also similar to 1957: Illnesses are generally mild, and the virus mostly strikes younger people. The H1N1 virus also appears to cause a similar fatality rate to the 1957 virus.</p>
<p>As with the current pandemic, epidemiologists in 1957 weren't sure if the outbreaks would intensify during the fall flu season. Even so, the 1957 pandemic caused minimal disruptions, in part because public health officials didn't close schools, cancel public events or impose travel restrictions.</p>
<p>In 1957, outbreaks intensified when the school year started in September, but flu cases levelled off by the end of November. Schools had absenteeism rates of up to 30 per cent, but the pandemic had little impact on workplace absenteeism except in schools and health-care facilities. Hospital admissions increased, but facilities had the capacity to handle the extra patients. While a vaccine was developed in time for the fall flu season, it had little impact because of limited availability and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Why do some otherwise healthy people get seriously ill or die from H1N1?</p>
<p>The answer isn't clear. Some seemingly healthy people may have risk factors for complications that are undiagnosed. With H1N1, obesity appears to be a risk factor for severe illness, which is not commonly seen with seasonal flu. Researchers have speculated that during the 1918 Spanish flu, young, healthy people became very ill because they have strong immune systems, and their immune response to infection kicked into overdrive, leading to more inflammation and severe disease. Researchers at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto are investigating whether particular genes are linked to a severe response to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>What can I do to protect myself from getting sick?</p>
<p>There is no vaccine currently available to protect against the new H1N1 virus. However, a vaccine is in production. As always, a vaccine will be available to protect against seasonal flu, but immunization against recent (2005 to 2009) seasonal flu viruses is unlikely to provide immunity against the H1N1 virus. Even though the seasonal flu vaccine won't protect you directly against the H1N1 virus, it will prevent you from getting the seasonal flu, which could weaken your immune system and make you more susceptible to H1N1.</p>
<p>What is being done to develop an H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, which has a manufacturing plant in Ste-Foy, Que., has been contracted to produce the H1N1 vaccine for Canadians. The federal government is picking up 60 per cent of the $400-million tab, while the provinces and territories will cover the rest. The company has said its first supply of vaccine would likely be ready in mid-November.</p>
<p>Unlike other countries, Canada is producing its own H1N1 vaccine rather than ordering from foreign suppliers, meaning there is enough vaccine for all Canadians who want it. The federal government has placed an order for 50.4 million doses of the vaccine. Canada has a population of 33.6 million. The federal pandemic plan uses the estimate that 75 per cent of the population would want vaccine. Ordering 50.4 million doses provides two shots for 75 per cent of Canadians. As an alternative, it could also provide one dose for everyone in the country, and a second dose for 50 per cent.</p>
<p>The results of clinical trials, expected to begin in September, will determine whether one dose or two will be required. In the event that everyone in the country wants the vaccine and everyone needs two doses of it, more could be ordered, health officials say.</p>
<p>Officials are working out which groups should receive the vaccine first because Canada could face a shortfall of the vaccine at the beginning of the flu season. So far, priority groups include health-care workers, people with pre-existing chronic conditions, residents of remote communities and those under the age of 50 -- a group unusually hard hit by the H1N1virus.</p>
<p>What are the potential health risks of the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>The World Health Organization insists the speed at which the H1N1 vaccine is being developed and tested is not compromising safety. Even so, Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO director of the initiative for vaccine research, has indicated that minor side-effects of a vaccine, including nausea and fever, are to be expected. She said "there is no doubt" that in any large-scale vaccination program, there will be cases of severe adverse reactions.</p>
<p>Health Canada's role will be to monitor all signs of adverse events and determine whether the side-effects are linked to the vaccine. Officials are also expected to be on high alert for signs of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can cause temporary paralysis. Cases of the syndrome emerged in the U.S. following a 1976 immunization campaign in response to a swine-flu outbreak. Thirty people died out of 40 million who were vaccinated.</p>
<p>If I have a family member at home who is sick with flu, should I go to work?</p>
<p>People who are well but who have an ill family member at home with flu can go to work as usual. You should monitor your health every day, and take everyday precautions including washing your hands often with soap and water.</p>
<p>What should I do if I get sick?</p>
<p>Stay home and avoid contact with other people, except to get medical care. This means avoiding normal activities, including work, school, travel, shopping, social events and public gatherings. If you have severe illness or you are at high risk for flu complications, contact your health-care provider, who will determine whether flu treatment is needed.</p>
<p>What are the warning signs of severe flu that require urgent medical attention?</p>
<p>In children, emergency warning signs include:</p>
<p>- fast or troubled breathing</p>
<p>- bluish or grey skin colour</p>
<p>- not drinking enough fluids</p>
<p>- severe or persistent vomiting</p>
<p>- not waking up or not interacting</p>
<p>- being so irritable that the child does not want to be held</p>
<p>- flu-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough</p>
<p>In adults, emergency warning signs include:</p>
<p>- difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</p>
<p>- bluish or grey skin colour</p>
<p>- bloody or coloured sputum</p>
<p>- chest pains</p>
<p>- sudden dizziness or confusion</p>
<p>- severe or persistent vomiting</p>
<p>- high fever lasting more than three days</p>
<p>- flu-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough</p>
<p>- low blood pressure</p>
<p>Are there medications to treat H1N1 infection?</p>
<p>Yes. Antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) are prescription medications that fight against the flu by keeping flu viruses from reproducing in your body. If you get sick, antiviral drugs can make your illness milder and make you feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. During the current pandemic, antiviral drugs are primarily being used to treat hospitalized flu patients and people who have a condition that places them at high risk for serious complications.</p>
<p>Should antiviral drugs be given to children with flu symptoms?</p>
<p>There is an ongoing debate about whether antivirals should be given to all children with flu symptoms. A recent study by Oxford University researchers concluded that children under 12 should not be given Tamiflu or Relenza because their side-effects outweigh any benefits. The study found that antivirals only led to a minor reduction in the length of time that a child with mild flu was ill and that Tamiflu caused vomiting in five per cent of children, which could lead to dehydration and complications. The Oxford researchers concluded that children with mild flu are better treated with rest and plenty of fluids.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the WHO maintains that antivirals are appropriate for children who have severe H1N1 flu, or who are at risk for H1N1 complications.</p>
<p>How long can flu virus survive on surfaces such as books and doorknobs?</p>
<p>Studies have shown that flu viruses can infect a person for two to eight hours after being on surfaces. On non-porous surfaces, they can survive for up to a few days.</p>
<p>What kills flu virus?</p>
<p>Flu virus is destroyed by heat as well as chemical cleaners with chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, detergents, iodine-based antiseptics and alcohol-based cleaners.</p>
<p>Can I get infected with H1N1 virus through water in swimming pools, water parks and spas?</p>
<p>There has never been a documented case of flu-virus infection linked to water exposure. No research has been completed on the susceptibility of H1N1 flu virus to chlorine and other disinfectants used in recreational water venues. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the amount of chlorine used to kill microbes in recreational water facilities, as recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, is adequate to disinfect avian flu A (H5N1) virus.</p>
<p>Can H1N1 virus be spread at recreational water venues outside of the water?</p>
<p>Yes. Recreational water venues are no different than any other group setting. The spread of H1N1 flu is thought to happen in the same way that seasonal flu spreads. Flu viruses are spread mainly from person to person through coughing or sneezing. Sometimes, people may become infected by touching something with flu viruses on it and then touching their mouth or nose.</p>

<p>The capital region's first and only school closure linked to the H1N1 virus happened last May at Hans Helgesen Elementary.</p>
<p>Although it turned out to be a false alarm, the situation gave Sooke school district officials a taste of what might be needed this fall and winter during flu season.</p>
<p>"It was a wake-up call for all staff and kids to understand how quickly not only H1N1 but any influenza can spread," said Sooke school superintendent Jim Cambridge.</p>
<p>Gathering places like schools, universities and colleges, where illness can move particularly fast, are taking careful aim at keeping H1N1 in check. The Sooke district has about 8,200 students, Saanich has 7,700 and Greater Victoria has almost 20,000. About 19,000 students are expected to attend the University of Victoria during the fall semester.</p>
<p>In May, with at least one case of H1N1 flu a possibility, Hans Helgesen was closed on a Tuesday afternoon and re-opened the following Monday. Testing at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control determined that no one at the school had the H1N1 virus, but as many as 30 per cent of the school's 188 students had symptoms of an influenza-like illness, including fever, nausea and cough.</p>
<p>Cambridge said existing protocol for local school districts requires them to notify the Vancouver Island Health Authority's public-health department when absenteeism exceeds 10 per cent at any school. It was VIHA's decision to close Hans Helgesen, he said.</p>
<p>The closure came at a time when H1N1 flu was appearing in pockets around the province, and had already led to similar school closures in Burns Lake and Vernon. A total of six B.C. schools were closed during the spring.</p>
<p>But now, public-health officials say they do not expect to have to close schools because of the virus. Based on new research and the experiences of other countries, they think closures don't always accomplish much. Stressing hygiene and keeping sick students at home will be effective in controlling the spread of H1N1 at schools, according to provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall.</p>
<p>Cambridge said there are basic measures in place in school districts to help keep the infection rate for H1N1 and other illnesses at bay.</p>
<p>"To mitigate the possibility of having an outbreak we've already done training with kids on correct hand-washing. And we've begun the process of putting hand sanitizers in classrooms that don't have sinks.</p>
<p>"We have a health-and-safety officer who's identified the most needy places, and staff has been working with our custodial supervisor to ensure that we're not just throwing them everywhere. We're looking at where the need is."</p>
<p>M.J. Lacroix, a Saanich district custodian, said a recent session with an expert on controlling infections has helped her and her colleagues feel prepared to deal with whatever the flu season may bring.</p>
<p>"It put our minds at ease," she said of the meeting with Cathy Munford, a nurse and infection-control practitioner at Victoria General Hospital. "It was really informative for us."</p>
<p>Lacroix said Munford stressed the need to clean well-used surfaces like doorknobs and desk tops, and to ensure that basic cleaning always precedes sanitizing. The thorough cleaning of all Saanich schools that happens before every academic year is being followed by an added round of sanitizing in response to the flu issue, Lacroix said.</p>
<p>At the University of Victoria, a planning committee with representatives from across campus and the public-health department has been meeting throughout the summer, said spokeswoman Patty Pitts.</p>
<p>Students will be the main focus of the committee's efforts because young adults have been particularly vulnerable to H1N1 in other countries, Pitts said. H1N1 information will be part of the student-orientation program, and staff in student residences are receiving special training to deal with the virus. About 2,200 students will be living in residences on campus.</p>
<p>Parents do not seem to be overly worried yet about a possible H1N1 outbreak, said Barb Lund, president of the Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils of Saanich.</p>
<p>"We have a good rapport with the district about keeping everybody informed right away if something changes. Is there a big worry from parents at this point? Probably not."</p>
<p>She said that alarming people doesn't do anyone any good.</p>
<p>"It's about good health practices, period."</p>
<p>The concept of "healthy schools," including proper hand-washing, has been an area of emphasis in the Saanich district for a number of years, Lund said, and signs outlining hand-washing techniques have been posted at Saanich schools.</p>
<p>"That sort of training holds in good stead for any sort of virus going through schools," she said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Reserves anxious but ready; After natives in Manitoba and Ontario took the biggest hit, B.C. First Nations make plans in case of an outbreak</b>
</div><div>Judith Lavoie </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>967 words</div><div>30 August 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>C4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist </div>
</p>
<p>Ground zero for a resurgence of H1N1 in B.C. is likely to be remote First Nations reserves where mouldy houses, overcrowding, poverty and chronic health problems make fertile breeding grounds for the flu virus.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the virus swept through remote reserves in northern Manitoba and Ontario. Delays in delivering supplies and medical help in those areas have spurred efforts to ensure B.C. First Nations are better prepared.</p>
<p>However, there is growing anxiety that some vulnerable members will be at risk this fall, admitted Grand Chief Doug Kelly, a member of the First Nations Health Council.</p>
<p>"So the easiest way to resolve anxiety is to confront it head on," he said.</p>
<p>B.C. is the only province with a First Nations tripartite health agreement involving federal, provincial and First Nations governments. In the case of H1N1, that means Health Canada, the province, regional health authorities, the First Nations Health Council and bands are preparing to thwart the virus.</p>
<p>"We are working together to ... make sure caregivers are on the ground and immunization plans are ready to go," Kelly said. "Everything we can do to educate our citizens is being done."</p>
<p>Dr. Evan Adams, aboriginal health physician adviser to the provincial health officer, said a B.C. First Nations H1N1 action plan is in place, together with an H1N1 working group made up of physicians and chiefs.</p>
<p>Out of the 203 B.C. reserves, 192 communities have detailed pandemic plans set to go, Adams said. Supplies, such as masks and medications, are being stockpiled at centres around the province so they can be shipped quickly to remote reserves.</p>
<p>So far, two reserves in the province have confirmed cases of H1N1, with one serious case and no aboriginal deaths, Adams said.</p>
<p>"However, we must assume it's more widespread. There are probably many, many more cases," he said.</p>
<p>The province is no longer reporting numbers of individual cases.</p>
<p>Dr. Lorna Medd, Vancouver Island Health Authority medical health officer, said cases in Vancouver Island First Nations communities were documented several weeks ago.</p>
<p>"It has been sporadic rather than an outbreak," she said. "But the numbers are almost certainly larger than we know."</p>
<p>Weekly conference calls to selected reserves, when health care professionals and community members report on trends, are giving heightened surveillance, Medd said.</p>
<p>"It's working well and it hasn't turned up anything worrisome," she said.</p>
<p>However, VIHA is aware of the potential for problems. Lessons learned in Manitoba are being applied on the Island, Medd said.</p>
<p>So is a more virulent virus going to bounce back in the fall? There's no way to tell, Medd said.</p>
<p>"We have experts weighing in on both sides, so we are acting as if it could be very serious."</p>
<p>Pauquachin First Nation in North Saanich is one of the reserves with identified cases of H1N1, although the cases appeared milder than normal seasonal flu, said Lucia Bartleman, a Pauquachin health worker.</p>
<p>"It has been and gone. By the time we found out about it [through tests sent to outside labs], it was long after people had already got over it," she said.</p>
<p>All precautions were taken the minute people became sick, with warnings going to band members about hand-washing and staying home if they were sick.</p>
<p>"We closed the office for two days and had someone come in and disinfect everything. It was pretty mild, but it did make the community aware," Bartleman said.</p>
<p>Despite all the precautions, the flu diagnosis did cause "a bit of a panic," in the community. "I think we handled it quite well and the chief and council did everything they could to calm things down, but people felt they had a right to know who it was," she said.</p>
<p>The Pauquachin experience accidentally rubbed off on the Pacheedaht First Nation of Port Renfrew. A health official mixed up the two names and the band was told -- erroneously -- that one of its members had H1N1.</p>
<p>"It put a scare into us," said band manager Dorothy Hunt. "It was a good learning experience for us, how quickly we were able to account for each band member."</p>
<p>Eydie Pelkey of the First Nations Adult Care Society deals with home care for the Saanich Peninsula bands. Clients are being reminded to take precautions, but Pelkey worries that reserves will not get the priority services they need.</p>
<p>"First Nations are always years behind in health and safety services. We have three and four generations in all our homes because there's such a lack of housing and [H1N1] could spread very fast," she said.</p>
<p>Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs agrees health care on reserves is underfunded and does not meet the standards of other Canadian communities.</p>
<p>"As a result of poverty and massive unemployment, our health conditions are far more precarious and fragile than the general population," he said, pointing to the epidemic of diabetes and tuberculosis outbreaks.</p>
<p>Phillip says he believes a serious pandemic is around the corner.</p>
<p>"One of my deepest and gravest concerns is that an outbreak will devastate First Nations," he said. "We have seen in Manitoba what can happen when the supports aren't there."</p>

<p>Global pandemics ranging from deadly outbreaks of small pox to bubonic plague have blighted the world since prehistoric times, killing millions of people. Before the H1N1 swine flu made its appearance, there had been three flu pandemics in modern times, of which Spanish flu was the worst.</p>
<p>SPANISH FLU</p>
<p>The 1918-19 Spanish flu infected a third of the world's population, killing between 20 million and 50 million people worldwide. In sheer numbers, it is believed to be the deadliest pandemic ever. It spread quickly around the world. Some claim up to 100 million died.</p>
<p>More than 90 years after it hit, scientists are still learning about the deadly strain of the H1N1 virus that caused the flu. Most infected people died from pneumonia, a testament to its ability to infect the lungs of victims.</p>
<p>In laboratory tests, the current H1N1 virus has shown a similar capacity to attack cells in the lungs of animals. It hasn't yet shown that capacity in people.</p>
<p>ASIAN FLU</p>
<p>The 1957-58 Asian flu pandemic was caused by the H2N2 virus that erupted in China, killing up to two million people worldwide by the time it was over. It was triggered by a deadly mingling of the human H1 flu with flu viruses from birds, particularly wild ducks. It first broke early in 1957, and by the end of the year the worst seemed to be over. Then, at the beginning of the following year, it reappeared strongly among the elderly, signalling what is now known as the second wave. Infection rates were high among school children and young adults but the elderly bore the brunt of the deaths.</p>
<p>The flu was relatively mild compared to the 1918 outbreak, partly because the virus was quickly identified and within months, a vaccine was available to treat patients.</p>
<p>HONG KONG FLU</p>
<p>The 1968-69 Hong Kong flu was caused by the H3N2 virus, which was descended from the H2N2 Asian avian flu. The outbreak was first detected in Hong Kong, where it was particularly serious, and then spread to other countries, including Singapore and Vietnam. It's believed that troops returning from Vietnam brought it to the U.S. It remains the mildest of the pandemics, killing about one million people. It was less deadly because, by 1968, scientific know-how had advanced well enough to cope with it. There were antibiotics and vaccines to cushion the blow. As well, since it was similar to the 1957 virus, scientists believe some people may have developed an immunity.</p>
<p>While there have been pandemic "threats" since then, the 1968 Hong Kong flu was the last flu pandemic, that is, until H1N1 swine flu came along in April.</p>

<p>- April 6: Mexican health officials declare an alert following an outbreak of "swine flu" in the town of La Gloria. About 60 per cent of the town of 3,000 is affected. - April 13: A 39-year-old woman in Oaxaca dies. - April 16: Mexican health officials contact the Pan-American Health Organization, an arm of the World Health Organization, over the illness. - April 22: The Mexican health ministry issues a nationwide alert and samples are sent to Canada for testing. - April 23: U. S. health officials announce that seven people have a flu virus known as H1N1 in California and Texas. All seven recovered. Canadian public health authorities announce that the Mexican "swine flu" virus is the H1N1 virus. - April 24: WHO announces that around 800 suspected cases of H1N1 have been recorded in Mexico, including 60 suspected deaths.</p>
<p> - April 25: An emergency committee of the WHO meeting in Geneva warns that the virus has "pandemic potential." Mexico orders isolation of sick people and closes many public establishments. - April 26: Canadian officials confirm four cases of H1N1 on the East Coast. - April 27: WHO raises its alert level to 4 from 3 on a scale of 6, meaning there is sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus causing outbreaks in at least one country, and signalling a "significant increase in risk of a pandemic." - April 28: Costa Rica confirms instances of H1N1. Israel confirms its first case of swine flu. Countries around the globe begin reporting cases over the next three months. - April 29: A 23-month-old Mexican child is the first confirmed death in the United States and the first one outside Mexico. WHO raises alert level to 5, calling on countries to prepare for an "imminent" pandemic. - April 30: WHO adopts the term "influenza A(H1N1)" after veterinary experts point out that the disease is not occurring among pigs. - April 30: Egypt announces it intends to slaughter its entire pig population, even though no cases have been detected in Egypt and despite the WHO pronouncement that the disease cannot be caught from eating properly prepared pork. The announcement angers many in Egypt's Christian minority, who keep most of the country's 400,000 pigs, and provokes clashes. - May 1: WHO warns that traditional flu vaccines have little effect against the virus. - May 6: Judy Trunnell, a 33-year-old teacher from Texas, is the first U. S. citizen to die from H1N1. - May 8: Canada reports its first H1N1 death. Tina L'Hirondelle, a 39-year-old who had a history of asthma and diabetes, died on April 28 in hospital in High Prairie in northern Alberta. An autopsy on the woman confirmed the presence of the virus. - May 19: A sharp rise in Japanese H1N1 cases, to 176, puts pressure on WHO to raise its alert to the highest level.

A total of 74 countries are now affected by the virus, with 27,737 cases, including 141 deaths. - June 14: the first U. K. death from H1N1 is reported. It is the first confirmed death outside the Americas. - July 22: The first Canadian case of swine flu that is resistant to the antiviral drug Tamiflu is reported in a 60-year-old Quebec man. It was not transmitted to anyone else. - July 24: WHO reveals that "160 out of 193 WHO member states now have cases, so we are nearing almost 100 per cent, but not quite yet." It said the pandemic had resulted in around 800 deaths, with the United States, Argentina and Mexico the three countries to have recorded the highest number of fatalities. The WHO found, from data from Canada, Chile, Japan, Britain and the United States, that the majority of cases are occurring "in younger people, with the median age reported to be 12 to 17 years." Those 60 and older appear to have more resistance to the virus. - July 27: The WHO says that more than 20 countries and overseas territories have first lab-confirmed cases of H1N1. These include holiday destinations such as the Seychelles, Turks and Caicos, St. Kitts and Nevis, Netherlands Antilles, Belize and France's Reunion Island, as well as isolated spots such as Tonga and American Samoa in the Pacific and the Solomon Islands in the Indian Ocean. H1N1 also found its way to Bhutan in the Himalayas and Andorra, an independent state tucked between Spain and France. Conflict-ridden Afghanistan and Sudan have also had their first confirmed infections.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Harper's senators and MLAs' lost minds</b>
</div><div>Paul Willcocks   </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>749 words</div><div>30 August 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>C2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>After a fair stretch watching politics up close, I remain baffled at what happens to people once elected. Consider, for starters, Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the latest batch of brazen patronage appointments to the Senate.</p>
<p>Among the most recent nine were the Conservative party election campaign chair, who is also an effective fundraiser, Harper's long-time, loyal communications assistant and -- for Pete's sake -- the Conservative Party's president.</p>
<p>Harper used to rail against such abuses. The Senate shouldn't be a retirement home or rich reward for political backroom types, he said. It should represent Canadians. No more payoffs to party backers at taxpayers' expense. (Senators are paid $130,000 and get a rich pension.)</p>
<p>Now, Harper is another old-school politician, just fine with the same kind of cronyism he once condemned.</p>
<p>The official Conservative explanation is that since Senate reform is stalled and the upper house has a majority of senators appointed by past Liberal governments, Harper needs to get loyalists in place to support government legislation and Senate reform.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Liberals did the same thing, the apologists add.</p>
<p>I can understand the idea of trying to grab control of the Senate. It's not particularly noble and contradicts everything Harper stood for as an outsider determined to bring reform. But it's pragmatic.</p>
<p>That still doesn't mean, though, that he had to use Senate jobs to reward loyal friends. There are hundreds of competent, committed conservatives sympathetic to the government's direction and known and respected in their communities. Why not seek them out? (And, in the process, increase respect for the Senate and politicians generally.)</p>
<p>The second excuse -- that the other guys were worse -- is more destructive. It's an admission that right and wrong aren't important, and inevitably means a race to the bottom.</p>
<p>It's not just Harper. It's a contagion every bit as infectious as swine flu. In opposition, the B.C. Liberals seemed genuine about doing things differently, in ways large and small. You'll never see our ministers being trailed by aides when they have to walk a few steps to a cabinet meeting, one told me. But they are, and the number of support staff hired to record the ministers' every word and carry their files has multiplied.</p>
<p>And MLAs spoke their minds. Here's Kevin Krueger on gambling: "Women in B.C. will die because of gambling expansion ... So children may die as a result of gambling expansion, and their blood will be on the heads of the government that expanded gambling and of the MLAs who voted for it."</p>
<p>Now he's silent.</p>
<p>I was thinking about this when the 26 new MLAs sat down in the legislature for the first time Tuesday.</p>
<p>It's a great honour to be selected by your fellow citizens to represent them. Generally, it's been earned in community service, working co-operatively with people of varied views and backgrounds. The chamber looks great, the Speaker is dressed up, people are sitting above, watching.</p>
<p>And then everybody starts yelling and catcalling across the way. Questions are barbed; responses are empty prattle. Pound the desk for your guy; jeer at their guy.</p>
<p>It's embarrassing. And it's inexplicable. How could good people let this happen to them?</p>
<p>Next door in Alberta, Conservative MLA Guy Boutilier was kicked out of the government caucus. His crime was publicly raising concerns about the cancellation of a long-term care centre in his community of Fort McMurray. The project had been approved and announced by Premier Ed Stelmach months before the 2008 election. Now the government said it would be put off four years and Boutilier spoke up to say that wasn't right.</p>
<p>We have a party system. Members have to share core principles and policies to allow election of a government that reflects the public will.</p>
<p>But there's nothing that says they have to turn into desk-thumping zombies, follow all orders or quit speaking for the people they represent.</p>
<p>Footnote: I am genuinely baffled at how this happens. MLAs should be important. They represent the people. Yet they are shunted into minor roles. Government MLAs were as surprised as the rest of the public by the imposition of the HST. They weren't asked how it would affect their communities or what they thought. They were just given talking points.</p>

<p>Another ghost-writing scandal has broken over the pharmaceutical industry. Last week, a senior professor at McGill University in Montreal admitted publishing a scholarly article that she did not entirely write. Part of the content was scripted by staffers at a firm called DesignWrite.</p>
<p>Why is that important? First, DesignWrite is paid by pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">Wyeth</span> to promote its drugs. But there was no mention of those co-authors in the article. That could mislead readers into believing the report was independent, when it was not.</p>
<p>Second, the article concluded that estrogen therapy helps prevent memory loss. But <span class="companylink">Wyeth</span> is a producer of estrogen-based medications. In the research field, such an obvious conflict of interest could invalidate the findings, if it were known.</p>
<p>In fairness, not all the facts are available. This might be an instance of carelessness rather than deception.</p>
<p>But it is, unfortunately, only the tip of an iceberg. There have been numerous cases of drug companies employing what some might consider fraudulent publications to boost sales.</p>
<p>According to the New York Times, <span class="companylink">Wyeth</span> also used this strategy to promote hormone replacement therapy for women. The company arranged for the publication of 26 ghost-written articles, to help create the impression of a scientific consensus which may not have existed.</p>
<p>This allegedly enabled <span class="companylink">Wyeth</span> to publicize the benefits of the treatment, while de-emphasizing its risks. Sales of the company's therapy reached $2 billion, before independent research linked hormone treatments to breast cancer, heart disease and stroke in menopausal women.</p>
<p>And <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> created a program called CASSPER to promote an antidepressant called Paxil. Sales staff enticed physicians to put their name on articles co-authored by company ghost writers (hence Cassper -- the friendly ghost.)</p>
<p>And there are instances where it appears drug companies have gone beyond fraudulent authorship, to outright manipulation of facts. <span class="companylink">Merck and Co</span>. are alleged to have arranged for dozens of ghost-written publications for the anti-inflammatory drug VIOXX.</p>
<p>An editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association alleges Merck used this smokescreen to misrepresent the risks of VIOXX. Specifically, it claims the number of fatalities in Alzheimer patients was significantly understated. VIOXX was subsequently withdrawn in Canada and the U.S.</p>
<p>And a contraceptive device named the Dalkon Shield was marketed by the <span class="companylink">A.H. Robins</span> pharmaceutical company, despite indications of unethical conduct in the research phase. The lead investigator appeared to have a major financial interest in the product, but this was not revealed. About $2 billion in damages were ultimately paid to women damaged by the device.</p>
<p>Most troubling of all, these various forms of misrepresentation and deceit appear to be widespread. One Canadian researcher reported that up to 40 per cent of clinical trial reports may be affected.</p>
<p>That elevates the practice from an occasional mis-step to more of a co-ordinated onslaught. It may explain, in part, why the pharmaceutical industry has a $20 billion marketing budget.</p>
<p>It's difficult to exaggerate the seriousness of the problem. Later this year, 30 million Canadians will sign up for swine flu vaccine. The vaccine is brand new -- it hasn't even been developed yet. When it arrives, we will have to trust the pharmaceutical industry that it is safe.</p>
<p>In fact, there is enough government oversight in this instance to provide reassurance. But what about all the other new drugs and treatments that come onto the market? How are we supposed to have confidence, when the industry is manipulating the truth about them?</p>
<p>This isn't about sales or profits or the corporate bottom line. It is a far bigger issue. Alan Cassels, a drug policy researcher at the University of Victoria, had this to say: "Ghostwriting, fundamentally, is about deception and fraud and is wreaking untold damage by gravely undermining our trust in medicine."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 surge may flood ICUs: WHO; Nations advised of second wave</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>673 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>D5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star </div>
</p>
<p>The World Health Organization is warning countries to prepare the intensive-care units of their hospitals for a surge of swine flu cases in the coming months.</p>
<p>In a pandemic update Friday, WHO advised countries in the Northern Hemisphere to get ready for a second wave and said doctors from around the world are reporting "a very severe form" of the disease, particularly in young and otherwise healthy people.</p>
<p>The update did not specify how many of these severe cases have been reported, but said in these patients the virus directly infected the lungs and caused extreme respiratory failure. Saving their lives depended on highly specialized and demanding care in ICUs, "usually with long and costly stays," WHO said.</p>
<p>The update confirmed the H1N1 virus "has rapidly established itself" and is the dominant strain of the influenza virus that is circulating in most parts of the world.</p>
<p>At least 2,185 people have died from the swine flu and there have been life-threatening cases, but the majority of cases around the world continue to be mild, according to the report, and the strain shows no signs of mutating into a more lethal form.</p>
<p>"While these trends are encouraging, large numbers of people in all countries remain susceptible to infection," the update said</p>
<p>Even if the cases remain mild, the impact of the second wave could still be significant because of the sheer number of people who may fall ill, and a higher number of severe cases could strain health care systems," according to the report.</p>
<p>"Larger numbers of severely ill patients requiring intensive care are likely to be the most urgent burden on health services, creating pressures that could overwhelm intensive care units and possibly disrupt the provision of care for other diseases," said WHO, which advised that preparedness measures should anticipate the increased demand on ICUs.</p>
<p>The impact of swine flu on ICUs and their ability to effectively treat patients with severe forms of the flu is on the agenda of a two-day conference being held next week in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Public health officials, ICU specialists and other experts from across Canada and the world are expected to review strategies to prepare for the anticipated second wave of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Canada's public health officials are hesitant to make predictions about how many people could contract the virus during a second wave, or when it will arrive.</p>
<p>Friday, chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones and Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq appeared before the House of Commons health committee for the second time this month. They were questioned about preparedness for the pandemic's second wave, and in particular on plans to help First Nations communities cope with outbreaks.</p>
<p>Ottawa, which is responsible for health care for aboriginal Canadians, faces ongoing criticism over its response to outbreaks on several reserves in the spring in northern Manitoba and on what it is doing now to help communities prepare.</p>
<p>The committee heard from a long list of witnesses, including Shawn Atleo, the newly elected national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Ron Evans, Manitoba's grand chief, and other representatives of the aboriginal community.</p>
<p>After Aglukkaq outlined measures the government has taken to help First Nations, New Democratic Party MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis said she presented a "rosy picture" and that it "flies in the face of everything we are hearing from First Nations communities."</p>
<p>"I don't think anybody here today would dare suggest that we are as prepared as we should be at this point at the end of August," said Wasylycia-Leis.</p>
<p>Chief Evans said the government "dragged their feet" when his community asked for help, and said he is concerned the swine flu will hit reserves again before the vaccine is ready to be administered in mid-November.</p>
<p>The pandemic is an opportunity to address the poor living conditions and serious health issues in many First Nations communities, Evans said.</p>

</p>
<p>Health professionals in Saskatoon aren't quite ready for the H1N1 flu pandemic predicted for the fall.</p>
<p>"If it got here tomorrow, we'd have to cope," said Dr. Ross Findlater, Saskatoon Health Region deputy medical health officer.</p>
<p>"The further in the future that the pandemic actually gets here or the next wave of this H1N1, the better prepared we will be."</p>
<p>Nearly 20 health-care workers, in two planning groups, meet regularly to decide how to best manage an outbreak of H1N1 influenza virus that's expected to resurface in pandemic proportions this fall or winter. Dozens of other workers are involved in sub-committees and in their own departments, fine-tuning the health region's response.</p>
<p>The organization will stay the course, following its pandemic plan that's been in place for the past several years, tweaking it as necessary during the anticipated outbreak, says Findlater.</p>
<p>Unknown to most people, public health officials monitor the effects of influenza on Saskatoon and area residents every year.</p>
<p>They have regular contact with several elementary and high schools in the city as well as some schools in the rural areas, monitoring absentee rates. They also track absenteeism at a few of the large employers in the city. A number of "surveillance" physicians are on board, providing public health with the number of patients they see with influenza-like illness. A couple of those doctors also order testing for all patients with respiratory symptoms to determine which strain of influenza is circulating in the community. As well, a Saskatoon and a rural hospital record emergency room visits of patients showing influenza symptoms.</p>
<p>Unless told otherwise, Saskatoon and area residents who think they may have the H1N1 virus should not be going to their doctor for routine testing. Only those people who are at risk because of other medical conditions should be seeing their doctor, says Findlater.</p>
<p>"It's very important to know when you are getting your first cases. As soon as you are pretty sure it's around, there isn't any benefit in people with mild disease being tested and the labs can be rapidly overwhelmed with the number of samples."</p>
<p>In addition to detection, planners are working on how to treat those who are ill and how to prevent the spread of the illness.</p>
<p>Much of the health region planning for treating patients involves the provincial government.</p>
<p>The province, which has purchased a stockpile of anti-viral drugs to be administered according to the severity of the illness, is storing Saskatoon's share. It has also bought additional ventilators to be distributed to the regions. While Saskatoon hospitals will receive seven more machines, where those ventilators will be placed still hasn't been decided.</p>
<p>Many details still have to be worked out on the prevention side of the planning. The immunization campaign is far from ready. No one knows exactly when the vaccine will be ready for distribution, although Findlater is expecting shipments to begin in early November.</p>
<p>Immunizing everyone in the Saskatoon Health Region would be an enormous undertaking. About 300,000 people live in Saskatoon and the outlying areas. Normally in the fall, about 25 per cent of residents are immunized for the seasonal influenza. Findlater says the health region is planning for 75 to 80 per cent of the population to receive the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Much discussion has taken place about who will administer the vaccine to such a large number of people in a relatively short period of time -- a one-month window. The talk has included recruiting more nurses, hiring student nurses and recalling retired nurses.</p>
<p>Public health nurses may have to be reassigned from their regular duties, such as school visits and baby clinics, to work at immunization clinics. Doctors in the health region vaccinate a significant number of patients for the seasonal influenza and they will be involved in the H1N1 campaign as well, says Findlater.</p>
<p>"Concrete plans haven't been developed for the immunization program. We're a few decisions away from being able to do the public communication on it."</p>
<p>The public campaign will also remind people to stay home if they are sick and to practise frequent and thorough handwashing.</p>
<p>It's not likely that schools will be closed or large public gatherings banned, because neither would stop the spread of the virus, says Findlater.</p>
<p>More work still needs to be done on several fronts as the health region's staff members adjust and modify the pandemic plan, but Findlater is confident that when the virus finally makes its reappearance, health professionals will do what they do best -- care for sick people.</p>
<p>"While we've got wait lists and wait times and people wait in emergency, we've got a fairly good, sophisticated health-care system in general, and that's true in Saskatoon."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Keep away from the pigs; It's these animals, not the people, who need protection at fall fairs</b>
</div><div>Hamilton Spectator wire services</div>
<div>1056 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>WR02</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>In a strange reversal of fortune, it is the pigs looking at the humans with caution as fair time starts up.</p>
<p>Expect plexiglass barriers, and two-metre spaces to separate the pigs from the people at fall fairs, as the pork industry balances a need to educate urbanites about farm life while preventing the spread of the H1N1 virus, known as swine flu.</p>
<p>But the need for barriers is not what you might expect.</p>
<p>"How can we protect our pigs from humans is the big question," says Keith Robbins of Ontario Pork, an organization representing provincial pork producers.</p>
<p>He says no pig is currently known to be infected anywhere in Canada, but that could change when humans come into contact with pigs at fairs. The fear is that an ill person will infect a pig.</p>
<p>Already, changes have been made at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto to ensure humans do not touch any pigs, and similar precautions are expected at this November's Royal Agricultural Winter Fair. Robbins is expecting pig farmers who bring their animals to smaller, local fairs to exercise the same caution.</p>
<p>"We want to make sure to keep (the flu) out of our herds."</p>
<p>It's a similar story in the United States.</p>
<p>As the Oregon State Fair opens this weekend, the pigs will be kept behind an elaborate configuration of plastic and ribbon barriers, taller-than-usual fences and off-limits walkways.</p>
<p>The state veterinarian is also urging visitors to stay about two metres away.</p>
<p>At the state fair in Iowa, visitors are barred from holding piglets, and in North Carolina, the state veterinarian, David T. Marshall, has advised fair visitors to wash their hands upon leaving -- and entering -- pig barns.</p>
<p>"The whole idea of the animals getting sick from people is a foreign concept to people, but that's what we're looking at here," says Marshall, whose state is one of several where E. coli outbreaks linked to fairs and petting zoos sickened dozens of people several years ago.</p>
<p>The flu discovered this spring includes genetic parts of human, swine and avian flu. Although its genetic structure technically makes the new strain a "swine flu," experts say, it has not been found in pigs in the United States or elsewhere, aside from a few herds in Canada, Argentina and Australia. In those cases, epidemiologists suspect that people working on farms may have infected the pigs around them.</p>
<p>The first such case occurred in mid-to-late April in Alberta, on a pig farm near Rocky Mountain House. It's not known -- and may never be known -- who introduced the virus into the pig population, but the Canadian Food Inspection Agency believes the source was human.</p>
<p>And the agency also believes two of its inspectors who investigated the outbreak and came down shortly thereafter with swine flu picked up the virus in the piggery. The men admitted they took off their protective equipment because they were hot.</p>
<p>The virus is not believed to be particularly deadly to pigs, scientists say, nor, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief veterinary officer and others, can it cause any risk for people eating pork. But scientists still hope to keep it from spreading in pigs, which can act as "mixing vessels" for human and avian flu, possibly leading to a more dangerous strain.</p>
<p>And there is the worry of public relations: Would a report of an infected pig at a fair harm the pork industry, already wrestling with economic misery in part because of people's unfounded fears over what the flu might mean for their dinner?</p>
<p>Those matters have left health authorities, fair organizers and those in the swine business wrestling with how best to balance risks of the flu with rural rites of summer. The result is a patchwork of rules on the matter of pigs and people.</p>
<p>Many local fair leaders say their existing safety measures -- like isolating livestock after fairs until a typical flu incubation period has passed -- already offer enough protection, and some question the scientific basis of strict guidelines elsewhere.</p>
<p>At the state fair in Wisconsin, where a young woman crowned "Fairest of the Fair" stood inside a pen where prize pigs were auctioned, pig owners scoffed at the suggestion that tested practices might need refinement.</p>
<p>"We had no thought of not coming," says Debbie Schoenbeck, whose family owns pigs.</p>
<p>Different approaches in how to deal with this have caused tension between some U.S. fair leaders and veterinarians. Don Hansen, Oregon's veterinarian, says he was contacted by lawyers for some county fairs and lampooned in cartoons for his relatively rigorous suggestions (the two-metre rule was not to "be written in stone," he says now), adding that he had "never seen a reaction as immediate and profound before on anything."</p>
<p>Among new provisions at this year's Des Moines expo was a requirement that exhibitors sign an affidavit attesting that they, their families and their animals had been healthy for at least the last seven days, and that they would remove their animals if show officials deemed it necessary.</p>
<p>Still, for some who raise pigs to sell to commercial producers, the possibility of a show pig's falling ill at a county fair sounded like one more needless horror in a crushing year.</p>
<p>Others wonder if mere talk of safety measures at fairs' swine barns actually scares people more than the measures would spare pigs: Might reminders to keep pigs safe just plant new, irrational fears about pork in some people's minds?</p>
<p>Given all of it, any decision about what should come of the summer fairs feels fraught.</p>
<p>"There were those who said you should be on the side of cancelling these shows, and there were others saying the shows have to go on," says Paul Sundberg, the vice-president of science and technology for the National Pork Board, a group representing the industry.</p>
<p>"It was dancing on the head of a pin."</p>

</p>
<p>The dreaded second wave of H1N1 flu is predicted to start within weeks -- long before the vaccine to protect against it is ready.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of concern as soon as the kids go back to school it will spike up again," said Dr. Astrid Petrich, H1N1 researcher and infectious disease specialist at St. Joseph's Hospital and McMaster University.</p>
<p>The pandemic virus, which has been hanging on all summer, is expected to go back to class with the kids Sept. 8.</p>
<p>But the vaccine won't be available until at least November.</p>
<p>"What if the main peak of H1N1 starts occurring well before the vaccine is available?" said Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton's medical officer of health.</p>
<p>It has schools warning parents to prepare for possible closures and it's made hand sanitizer a new back-to-school staple. Absenteeism will be closely monitored.</p>
<p>"I'm very concerned," said Christy Cowan, who has a daughter going into Grade 1 and a toddler at home. She's also seven months pregnant, which puts her at increased risk of becoming severely ill.</p>
<p>"My concern is that she'll bring it home and that there will be dire consequences as opposed to the usual runny nose and fever."</p>
<p>There is little other than handwashing parents can do to protect their families from H1N1 until the vaccine is available.</p>
<p>Immunizations are expected to start in November but will take weeks to get to everyone who wants one. It's also likely people will need two shots, delaying protection longer.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>10 ways to talk to kids about flu prevention without scaring; Tell them you'll take care of them if they get sick -- just as you always have</b>
</div><div>Joanne Chianello    </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>722 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun    </div>
</p>
<p>As kids flood back to school, you may be tempted to sit them down and give them a good talking to about H1N1.</p>
<p>Resist. Haranguing your kids to obsessively wash their hands or to shun schoolmates with a slight cough will only freak them out -- and will likely not help them avoid swine flu.</p>
<p>Here's how health professionals say you should talk to your kids about H1N1:</p>
<p>- If your children don't raise the issue, it's up to you to do it. One way to approach the topic is to ask what they've heard about it, so you know what's going through their minds.</p>
<p>"They may or may not raise it, but they're probably thinking about it," says Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>- Answer all questions and correct all misconceptions as clearly as possible. That means getting up to speed on H1N1 yourself. Be concrete in your answers and do not avoid hard questions. If you don't know the answer, it's OK to say, "I don't know, but I'll find out." Then do it.</p>
<p>- Calm down. "Kids pick up on our anxieties," says Butler-Jones. "If it sounds like we know what we're doing, then they're reassured." This will be easier if you're confident in the facts.</p>
<p>- Avoid calling it "swine flu." "That can sound scary for kids, who often make visual associations," says Dr. Virginia Bourget, a psychologist at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. "A scary pig -- that's even worse than bird flu!" Try to stick to H1N1, or if that's a bit too scientific, try influenza. Even plain old "flu" will do.</p>
<p>- Although you should answer their questions about the flu, you must make it clear that it's not their job to worry about how to manage it -- at home or at school.</p>
<p>"Children will often think they're responsible for things they aren't responsible for," says Bourget. "That makes them insecure."</p>
<p>- It's inevitable that children will hear all kinds of things about H1N1 -- accurate and inaccurate -- but limit their exposure to media reports and adult conversations about the flu. They aren't appropriate for most school-age children and can raise their anxiety levels, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>- Don't brush off your kids' fears about the seriousness of H1N1, but do try to bring some perspective. If your son asks if people can die from this flu, don't lie. But do impress upon him that deaths in Canada have been rare, and most of those who died were already sick with something else.</p>
<p>"Children have a poor grasp of things like probability and numbers," says Bourget. "Even very bright kids, if you ask them how many people live in Ottawa, they might say a thousand."</p>
<p>- Reminding children about good hygiene habits is never a bad idea, but badgering children to wash or disinfect their hands probably won't lead to them doing it more often. Scaring them will not change their behaviour.</p>
<p>Instead, reinforce those habits by practising good hygiene yourself at home. At school, teachers will also lead by example, directing the entire class to wash their hands before lunch.</p>
<p>- If a classmate or friend gets sick -- which is likely -- make sure you explain to your children that it doesn't necessarily mean they too will get sick. If they do, stress that you will take care of them the way you always do.</p>
<p>- Children always need to feel safe and loved, and if they are worried about a situation like a flu pandemic, that need will increase. Make sure you let your kids know it's OK to feel angry or afraid.</p>

a good example yourself.

<div id="hd"><b>'Most organizations don't have a plan yet'; The next few weeks are critical for H1N1 readiness</b>
</div><div>Vito Pilieci    </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>930 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>H1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen    </div>
</p>
<p>T he potential outbreak of the H1N1 virus this fall could have disastrous implications for unprepared Ottawa businesses, according to numerous public- and private-sector groups.</p>
<p>The Conference Board of Canada released a report last month stating that, while businesses were aware that a second wave of H1N1 infections would likely take place this fall, many are not doing enough to prepare for the spread of the flu.</p>
<p>"When you are looking at a pandemic, you have to look at the degree of absenteeism that will occur. People will be sick, family members will be sick and some people may be scared to come in to work," said Gilles Rhéaume, vice-president of public policy at the Conference Board of Canada. "For a major pandemic, you can expect between 25 per cent all the way up to 35 per cent of your workforce being absent and, in that case, how do you continue to operate? I would say most organizations don't have a plan yet."</p>
<p>Rhéaume said businesses without a plan risk not being able to operate should H1N1 escalate this flu season. He also said old business continuity plans, which may have been created for previous flu outbreaks like SARS or avian flu, must be updated to reflect the current business climate and the specifics of H1N1.</p>
<p>"Everyone was caught by surprise given how it (H1N1) happened, where it came from and the speed that it happened," Rhéaume said. "Even for those businesses that do have a plan, they have to dust it off and ask, 'How would it operate under current conditions?' Business conditions have changed since 2005."</p>
<p>Late last month, the Conference Board released a report called Ready or Not: Effective Pandemic Response, which was based on a round-table discussion held with numerous businesses to gauge whether they were prepared for the coming flu season.</p>
<p>The Conference Board isn't the only one trying to get the word out on being prepared.</p>
<p>Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's chief medical officer of health, is also warning there is no time to waste. Every business should be planning for the worst-case scenario, even if it never becomes a reality.</p>
<p>"We anticipate a busy flu season and expect to see this virus," said Levy.</p>
<p>"We have been hearing that some large businesses have done some planning. It's important that all of us, as components of the system ... that we all pitch in," said Levy.</p>
<p>With the potential for employee absenteeism to skyrocket, every aspect of a business could be in jeopardy. Suppliers and transportation companies could be shut down, effectively leaving a business with nothing to sell, assuming, of course, that customers are still shopping.</p>
<p>John Ash, manager of Ottawa's Emergency Measures Unit, said all businesses should have some sort of current emergency plan in place to help them during a time of crisis. He said even if H1N1 wasn't expected to be a problem this fall, events like the Ice Storm of 1998 and the sudden SARS outbreak in Toronto prove that emergencies happen without warning.</p>
<p>"We encourage and promote that all businesses take business continuity planning seriously," he said. "Yes, it's an effort, but it will certainly pay off." The city is offering a program called Are You Ready, which can be accessed through its website or by calling 311. The program gives citizens and businesses access to emergency preparedness experts.</p>
<p>Other organizations are also offering assistance when it comes to preparing for this fall's H1N1 spread. The Ottawa Chamber of Commerce has partnered with a local nursing organization to help businesses facilitate the administration of flu vaccines to employees. The organization can also arrange mask-fitting sessions for businesses to make sure the surgical masks protecting workers actually fit the employees' faces. (Public health agencies do not encourage the use of masks by the general public, because their improper use can spread infection.)</p>
<p>Some businesses have heard the warnings and are now working towards creating a plan. Michel Jullian, chief executive of electronic parts maker OCM Manufacturing Inc., said he has held meetings with his executives and is in the midst of formulating a business plan that would allow them to continue operating during the worst possible scenario.</p>
<p>"The risks are you can have up to 50-per-cent absenteeism from anywhere from a couple of weeks up to eight weeks," he said. "We are trying to plan for that and see how that could affect us; it would be significant. We are trying to figure out how to minimize that absenteeism."</p>
<p>Jullian said his business is in the early stages of formulating a business plan, but will encourage vaccinations as soon as they are made available by having a clinic at his place of business. He is encouraging tele-work, to allow employees who can work to work at home, and his company is looking at medical supplies like surgical masks, gloves and hand gels that kill bacteria.</p>
<p>He is not as concerned with the possibility of being cut off from supplies to make his electronic components as he already works with numerous suppliers.</p>

</p>
<p>In the past couple of weeks, a great deal of attention--and there will be more -- has been focused on the changes underway in Alberta's health system. We welcome it.</p>
<p>The transformation and the challenges we face are unprecedented. And because we all have a stake in the outcome, it will be critical to our success that we engage the people we serve and the 90,000 dedicated, informed health-care experts on our front lines.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that we are not creating a health system for this year or next, but for decades and generations to come. We are stepping forward at the earliest stages, and being transparent about what we think needs to be done, and why. Our plans and proposals are not set in stone because we know that we do not have all of the answers.</p>
<p>The most significant changes within Alberta Health Services will centre on the balance of hospital and community-based care--providing the right care in the right place.</p>
<p>Every day, hundreds of patients across the province are in hospitals because we do not have the broad scope of community-based care that would provide better treatment and support closer to their homes and families. There has been plenty of speculation about what that means for our patients, so let me be absolutely clear:No hospital spaces will be closed unless and until community-based beds and services are in place. Full stop.</p>
<p>We recently announced a decision not to redevelop one of our psychiatric hospitals, Alberta Hospital Edmonton, and instead focus on creating more community-based mental-health spaces.</p>
<p>I was not surprised by some of the opposition to the decision. We all feel strongly about the interests of these and all of our patients. But that does not change the fact that the decision was based on the best medical evidence and advice. We can and will balance our budget. We can and will be international leaders in the transformation of health. But most importantly, we can and will put the needs and interests of our patients first.</p>
<p>Health care in Alberta is good, often excellent, and in some areas world-leading. You are more likely to survive a heart attack in Alberta than anywhere else in the country. People survive strokes in Alberta at a rate well above the national rate. Our researchers and clinicians develop approaches and protocols that are picked up internationally as the best practices available anywhere. More than in any other province in the country, Albertans rate their own perceived health as excellent or very good.</p>
<p>Under the previous system, though, not everyone in Alberta had equitable access to the best possible health care. Artificial boundaries and interregional rivalries created unacceptable barriers. Financially, it is fair to say that the system was on the verge of collapse. We have a long way to go to stabilize it. The old model left us with a huge accumulated deficit, and the first thing to do when you are in a hole is to stop digging.</p>
<p>Our current rate of spending was not sustainable. So, the next phase of a multi-year framework to develop a balanced budget will begin next week. Alberta Health Services entered the 2009-10 budget year with a projected deficit of $1.3 billion. During the first phase of cost reduction, $650 million in potential annualized cost savings were identified and are being reviewed. Some are underway and can be implemented sooner than later. In the second phase, AHS will consult with staff to identify a further three per cent in annualized cost savings. This week, we also announced an early retirement/ buyout option for employees.</p>
<p>We will keep a close eye on the uptake, and if it becomes apparent that we need to slow it down to ensure we have enough staff, that is exactly and immediately what we will do. There are many people who might want to retire , and in some cases we'll have to say, "No, we need you to stay."</p>
<p>But first, we will tackle this budget deficit by focusing on duplication and non-clinical opportunities to reduce spending. We've already identified several strategies in that area, including procurement, which is expected to save us at least $200 million. By purchasing as a single system, we can save $2 million on the products we need for arthroplasties-- the replacement of hips, knees and shoulders giving out among the aging population. By moving to a single vendor for cardiac supplies, along with a backup vendor, we can save about $3.5 million. We are beginning to realize millions in savings from consolidating back-office functions in areas such as payroll, human resources, health records, and information management.</p>
<p>Back to patient care. A cornerstone of the plan to reduce the seasonal impact on our Emergency departments this winter is our pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns. Every Albertan is eligible for free H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccine this year. We'll be running immunization clinics in mass venues as well as at community health centres across the province. The more people we can protect against influenza viruses, the fewer we'll have needing care for influenza complications in hospital.</p>
<p>In the next few weeks, we will talk more about performance targets-- where we are setting the bar--and my personal commitment to access, quality and sustainability. Not one: All three.</p>
<p>There are tough decisions to come. Those decisions will be better informed through the constructive engagement of our staff, physicians, and you, the people we serve. I would rather be criticized for not having all of the answers today than for not spending enough time listening to the people who will helps us achieve all three goals: access, quality and sustainability.</p>
<p>In the few months since I moved here from Australia, lots of people have already weighed in--I've seen and heard lots of good ideas, so that tells me this is the right way to go about balancing our budget while maintaining a commitment to put patients first.</p>
<p>It's time to get the discussion moving. I invite you to be part of it.</p>

</div><div>Vito Pilieci    </div>
<div>Ottawa Citizen; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>365 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal    </div>
</p>
<p>It's common to see photographs of people in flu zones wearing white surgical face masks, but medical experts are still debating their effectiveness when it comes to keeping the masses healthy.</p>
<p>The best of these devices has been proven to drastically reduce a person's chances of contracting an airborne illness. However, if used improperly, masks also can increase a person's risk of becoming ill.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada does not recommend wearing masks, claiming that people often wear them incorrectly or contaminate themselves when putting the masks on or taking them off. Most masks, which can be purchased at pharmacies, are meant for one-time use and should not be worn for a period exceeding six hours.</p>
<p>A recent warning from the World Health Organization offered similar advice, stating that "using a mask incorrectly . . . may actually increase the risk of transmission, rather than reduce it."</p>
<p>Both health agencies recommend that people wash their hands regularly and cough into their sleeves to reduce the chances of contracting or spreading any flu-like illness.</p>
<p>However, one recent study found that, when used correctly, surgical masks of the N95 variety (a paper and fabric combination with a 95 per cent filtration efficiency) can reduce the risk of contracting respiratory viruses and flu by as much as 80 per cent.</p>
<p>The study was based on results gathered by Raina MacIntyre, an epidemiologist and head of the school of public health and community medicine at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. MacIntyre conducted clinical trials during the winters of 2006 and 2007 involving 286 patients.</p>
<p>The results were published in the journal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this year.</p>
<p>Several health-care organizations in major Canadian cities, offer services, including mask fittings, to help people ensure they are wearing the masks properly.</p>

</div><div>Bob Borreson   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>

</p>
<p>Re: "Natural gas slump drives up deficit; Bargain price ravages provincial revenues," The Journal, Aug. 27.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Iris Evans is blaming low natural gas prices as the culprit for Alberta's deficit.</p>
<p>It is ironic how, under Tory economics, companies producing a product in surplus demand have received a$2-billion royalty break from the Stelmach government to produce more natural gas and create employment.</p>
<p>Alberta customers of natural gas now see a lower price on their utility bills for natural gas. My recent Direct Energy bill shows I paid between 3.2 cents and 1.9 cents for slightly over two gigajoules of natural gas used. Yet my gas bill totalled $49.74 after all the Tory-deregulated charges are applied.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the government of Canada is coming up with a huge cash program to help farmers transition out of pork production as pork prices are falling precipitously due to swine flu. This happens even though there is no scientific evidence that swine flu is caused by consuming pork. The thinking is the demand for and price of pork are low, therefore stop producing pork.</p>
<p>Which Conservative government is correct here? The Alberta Conservatives say subsidize the production of natural gas because the price is low. They have fixed the utility business so that the cost to consumers is outrageous, no matter the actual market value of the product.</p>
<p>The federal Conservatives are saying to pork producers, here is government money get out of the business, pork prices are too low there is an oversupply of pork.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Nurses only needed during boom?</b>
</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>688 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Alberta nurses could be forgiven for feeling like they're stuck in the revolving doors of a hospital these days, unsure whether to walk in or out.</p>
<p>First, 5,000 of them were laid off during sweeping government health-care cuts in the 1990s. Then, as recently as a year ago, some were lured back to work with recruitment drives and offers of free refresher courses to upgrade their skills. Now, they may be offered early retirement as part of the government's cost-cutting measures.</p>
<p>Economic times have changed in those intervening years; first for the better--then, for the worse. The health-care system now faces a$1.3-billion deficit, and 70 per cent of its budget is spent on human resources.</p>
<p>The fact that health-care savings can be realized by eliminating health-care workers' jobs is simple mathematics. What is less easily understood is the rationale that led the provincial government to say mere months ago that it was still facing a shortage of nurses, and to now say it is seeking to eliminate some of those nursing jobs as part of its plan to save $315 million.</p>
<p>"Patient care is our first priority," Alberta Health Services CEO Stephen Duckett said this week as part of the announcement. "We will have to make difficult decisions and choices to make sure that we can keep that our priority in the years ahead."</p>
<p>Yet, it would appear these staffing decisions are being based not on patient-care requirements, but on budgetary ones. While officials have found savings in other areas--some $615 million in changes to payroll and purchasing--any money saved by reducing the number of nurses can't help but affect patient care.</p>
<p>Oddly, just the day before announcing the job cuts, Duckett assured Albertans wait times in emergency rooms would decrease. And we've all been promised free vaccinations this fall against both seasonal flu and H1N1.</p>
<p>The province's emphasis now seems to be on training and hiring LPNs, or licensed practical nurses, who receive less education and pay. And while LPNs play a valuable role in the health-care system, they are no replacement for RNs.</p>
<p>Mere months ago, however, the province appeared to be committed to increasing its contingent of nurses in response to an acknowledged shortage. It funded a special program at Grant MacEwan College this past year to refresh the skills of nurses who had left the field. It put$3 million into recruitment efforts and sought nurses from as far away as Australia, England and the Philippines. How receptive will those nurses abroad and elsewhere in Canada now be, next time the economy improves and Alberta again puts out the call for their skills?</p>
<p>Just last March, a health superboard spokesman said the number of nurses on maternity leave, some eight per cent of the total, was "starting to scare the heck out of us.</p>
<p>"If we don't do anything or any planning or any growth, we're looking at needing to recruit 1,300 nurses every year. There is still a local deficit," Rob Stevenson said.</p>
<p>And as recently as April, the premier and health minister assured opposition politicians that there was no hiring freeze on doctors or nurses, and that the province was actively recruiting both.</p>
<p>It's one thing to now say we can't afford those plans. It's quite another to insist that patient care won't suffer as a result, and that, in fact, wait times will decrease and overall quality will improve.</p>
<p>Nurses union president Heather Smith says she struggled to find an appropriate analogy for the province's logic. "It's as if Alberta Health Services is saying, we're not just going to ignore the potholes in the road, we're actually going to dig them, and your ride is going to be smoother than it's ever been."</p>
<p>Albertans need assurances that the government is making patient care, not budget cuts, its biggest health priority. Its inconsistent messages to date can only create more confusion and concern.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Outdated flu plan leaves Albertans exposed: Taft; Liberal MLA cites document directing people to shuttered health regions</b>

</p>
<p>Alberta's formal plan to counter the flu pandemic expected to hit this fall appears to be critically outdated, leaving Albertans vulnerable to a disaster similar to the SARS, tainted water and listeriosis scandals, says Liberal MLA Kevin Taft.</p>
<p>"I think the most telling is the fact the pandemic plans are from April 2008 and still refer people to the regional health authorities," said Taft, speaking of the government's online emergency plan document for health-care workers.</p>
<p>It refers to the role of regional health authorities in managing the pandemic, but the regions no longer exist.</p>
<p>"What that tells me is the government has taken its eye off the ball in terms of pandemic preparation," said Taft, who wrote about his concerns in a letter to the premier.</p>
<p>"It's symbolic. My deep concern is that the complete turmoil inside Alberta's health-care system means that people are attending to job cuts and career moves and reorganizations when they should be really attending to things like preparing for a pandemic."</p>
<p>In his letter to the premier, Taft asked:</p>
<p>-If the provincial lab is capable of and has the expertise to deal with an influx of blood tests.</p>
<p>-If Dr. Andre Corriveau, chief medical officer of health for Alberta Health and Wellness, would have decision-making authority over Alberta Health Services' CEO Stephen Duckett, whose recent focus has been on tightening purse strings.</p>
<p>-If the tent currently being used at the Stollery Children's Hospital to treat pediatric emergencies would be used for flu treatment.</p>
<p>-What training programs are in place for staff to respond to flu cases while still protecting themselves.</p>
<p>"If our government isn't ahead of the curve on these issues, isn't tightly focused on preparing for pandemics, people will die," Taft said.</p>
<p>"If it turns out there is a mad scramble and terrific confusion (about) who's in charge, people will die."</p>
<p>John Tuckwell, spokesman for Alberta Health and Wellness, said Premier Ed Stelmach will be responding directly to Taft about his concerns.</p>
<p>"Dr. Corriveau said, right from the beginning of H1N1, that we have a plan in place," Tuckwell said. "It's a living, breathing document. It isn't something set in stone, and both Alberta Health Services and Alberta Health and Wellness are continuing to adapt the plan and adjust it for what we're learning about H1N1."</p>
<p>Tuckwell said the plan online is an overall framework.</p>
<p>All the details are being constantly talked about and implemented in the medical community, he said. "Internally, Alberta Health Services has made all the adjustments. Local medical officers of health are in place. Within the system, people know who they're reporting to. The fact that the printed plan is now a little out of date is kind of irrelevant to how the health system responds.</p>
<p>"I think the priority is on the preparedness for the health system, not so much ensuring that the right document is on the Internet."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hollywood faces outbreak of pandemic films; No shortage of disease scenarios on the big screen</b>

<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>1284 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Not long after the Second World War, North Americans were revelling in a Japanese invasion. Japanese monster movies were all the rage, with Godzilla and friends raging down the streets of Tokyo and across movie screens throughout the continent.</p>
<p>What a difference a few years make. Despite recent American remakes of Godzilla, and despite director J. J. Abrams' attempts to create a homegrown, made-in-America monster with Cloverfield, the giant monsters have recently been buried by tiny ones.</p>
<p>Specifically, by microbes. The last few decades have witnessed a veritable pandemic of pandemic flicks in which little monsters do what Godzilla never could: destroy not just Tokyo, but the world.</p>
<p>We've seen, for example, a lonely Vincent Price in the The Last Man on Earth (1964), which was remade as The Omega Man starring Charlton Heston in 1971, which then became a vehicle for Will Smith in 2007 as I am Legend. There was also a fourth version, I am Omega, starring straight-to-video martial artist Mark Dacascos, but forget I mentioned it.</p>
<p>Although each of these movies differs in details, the plots are similar enough--humanity has been wiped out, except for a lone human and a not-so-merry band of photophobic deformities, as a result of those damnable scientists creating biological weapons or a cure for cancer that goes awry.</p>
<p>Then there was George Romero's 1968 classic Night of the Living Dead--the granddaddy of zombie flicks--in which our metabolically challenged anti-heroes first rise from a cemetery. We later learn, while they're chewing their way through a shopping mall in the sequel Dawn of the Dead, they were the product of a plague.</p>
<p>Next came Michael Chrichton's The Andromeda Strain, first filmed in 1971 in a faithful adaptation of the book, and "reimagined" in a 2008 TV miniseries.</p>
<p>Here a satellite containing an alien microbe falls to Earth, and earthlings soon start falling themselves, and falling over themselves in search of an antidote.</p>
<p>In 1995, we saw Outbreak, probably the least fantastic of the pandemic movies in that not a single zombie or alien made the cut. Then again, having Dustin Hoffman scurrying around trying to save the world is probably fantastic enough.</p>
<p>The Brits got in on the action with 28 Days Later (2002) and its sequel 28 Weeks Later (2007)--is there a prize for guessing what the third instalment will be called? Oh, wait, I just read that 28 Months Later will be released in 2011. Anyway, here we had a virus, released when animal rights activists vandalized a lab, turning people into, you guessed it, flesh-eating zombies.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, the Spanish produced REC (2007)--remade in English as the vastly inferior Quarantine (2008)--in which a rabies-like virus, stolen by a doomsday cult from a military research lab, magically transforms people in an apartment building into--do I have to tell you?</p>
<p>That's just a small sample of the worldwide end-of-the-world-in-a-microbe mythos. But how did the little monsters come to eclipse the big ones?And how did we come to be awash in viruses and bacteria? Blame Richard Matheson. The celebrated sci-fiauthor, who penned many of the original Twilight Zone episodes and a series of acclaimed novels and short stories, is also almost single-handedly responsible for the disease-apocalypse scenario, and for the rise of the zombie.</p>
<p>The year was 1954, the very year that Godzilla first strutted his stuff for Japanese audiences. In that year, Matheson also strutted his stuff, publishing the novel that would become his most famous: I am Legend.</p>
<p>Not that I am Legend. Not the one with Will Smith, or Charlton Heston, or Vincent Price. Matheson rejected all three treatments since they were insufficiently faithful to his vision.</p>
<p>Matheson's vision had Robert Neville, an apparently lone human at war with people who were infected by a bacterium and now resemble vampires. Neville meets a woman, Ruth, who also appears uninfected, but is sympathetic to the vampires. Eventually he discovers that Ruth is infected, that the vampires have begun to rebuild society and that they hate Neville for killing some of their members.</p>
<p>Neville is ultimately captured by the vampires, and comes to realize that he has become the biological deviant, that he is the sole survivor of an obsolete race, that he--not the vampire--is now legend. Upon realizing this, and with Ruth's help, he commits suicide.</p>
<p>One can readily see here the genesis of the pandemic-apocalypse theme as well as the zombie motif. George Romero in fact admitted that Night of the Living Dead was "ripped off" from I am Legend, and Stephen King, whose novel The Stand concerns a human-made superflu, has admitted a debt to Matheson.</p>
<p>King's recent novel Cell, which involves zombies, is dedicated to Matheson and Romero.</p>
<p>This explains the inspiration for pandemic films, but not their appeal. There's an easy answer for this, though: Unlike Godzilla, who, let's face it, is pretty hard to miss, microbes are, by definition, invisible. We never know when we're coming into contact with a virus or a bacterium and hence they produce the greatest fear of all: fear of the unknown. And that fear is exacerbated by the breakdown in communications that inevitably follows an outbreak.</p>
<p>The appeal of movies also depends on the cultural milieu in which they arise. Many Japanese movie monsters were in some way associated with atomic weapons --Godzilla, for instance, was the product of atomic radiation --which is entirely understandable given that they were spawned in the only country that has experienced the horrors of nuclear war.</p>
<p>Similarly, and despite the fact that pandemic movies are virtually never scientifically accurate, these films rose to popularity in the age of AIDS, a time when some feared the disease would render I am Legend more science than fiction.</p>
<p>Reports of other exotic viruses, such as Ebola--Outbreak concerned an Ebola-like virus--and Hantavirus solidified this fear, and with new viruses such as H1N1 making appearances, dangerous microbes continue to occupy our imagination more than our bodies. The invisibility of microbes also allows them to act as metaphors. For example, since I am Legend was published during the height of the "red scare," when people feared that undercover communists were threatening America, many commentators interpreted the novel as a narrative about communism.</p>
<p>Matheson has denied this was his intention, but one can see Ruth, the apparent human who is working for and from the other side, as a metaphor for the undercover commies that Senator Joseph McCarthy sought to expose.</p>
<p>Microbes work equally well as a metaphor in the age of terrorism, since just as we never know who might be infected, people were oblivious to the fact that those quiet young men down the hall were preparing a terrorist attack on 9/11. Much like in pandemic movies, you can never tell for sure whether or when your neighbour might morph into a flesh-eater.</p>
<p>Given this state of affairs, the prognosis for pandemic flicks is good: They are likely to have a long and healthy life, even though they're more fiction than fact, more tale than truth. They are, one might say, their own curious form of legend.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A reality show in waiting; The Orangutan Foundation's volunteer program could fill the bill</b>
</div><div>Janie Dubman   </div>
<div>Special to the Sun</div>
<div>573 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>H4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Simon Fraser University student Janie Dubman, 20, is spending the summer volunteering at an orangutan care centre in Borneo and sharing her experiences with Sun readers. This is her last dispatch from Borneo.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Four months ago, had somebody told me I'd be directing eight people older than me on how to construct an ironwood bridge in a Bornean swap, I'd have laughed. Now, giving orders about sawing wood, hauling planks and buying timber seems like the most natural thing in the world. All that, between bargaining in the market and organizing rides in the backs of pickup trucks. All in Indonesian.</p>
<p>The Orangutan Foundation International's pilot volunteer program has been running for a month now.</p>
<p>The two groups this year, numbering 12 and nine people respectively, had the task of building a bridge in the swamp forest around the care centre, which helps the local assistants follow the orangutans on their daily releases.</p>
<p>As coordinator, I have been on call 24/7, and my job is to translate, plan, feed, boss, educate and otherwise run their life during their three week stay here. And I love it.</p>
<p>First of all, it's just amusing to observe people, fresh out of the city, do hard physical labour in one of the hottest, most humid places in the world.</p>
<p>All sorts of reactions.</p>
<p>I won't go into details, but there may have been an incident involving a common cold, three volunteers in the hospital and two weeks under swine flu quarantine. The social dynamic of the whole thing is just asking to be made into a reality TV show; take a dozen people aged 18 to 65, from all over the world, throw them together and make them work and live very closely for three weeks under taxing physical conditions.</p>
<p>To spite me, they all become best buddies, but I'm still waiting for the tear-sodden psychological breakdown.</p>
<p>Our unlikely abode is a zoo purchased and closed down by OFI in 2008.</p>
<p>We live in a stilt house, eat on the floor, and spend our free time observing the proboscis monkeys and macaques in the four-hectare jungle that has become a sanctuary for them.</p>
<p>Since our worksite is in the vicinity of the care centre, the volunteers get a close-up look at the facility not usually open to the public.</p>
<p>Seeing the wonder and delight on their faces as they watch the orangutans romp in the forest during the day is the sincerest testament to their appreciation of the treat.</p>
<p>They also get a chance to spend time with Dr. Birute Galdikas, which is a dream come true for many of them.</p>
<p>After living here for three and a half months, I've both fallen in love with the orangutans and their jungle and become painfully aware of the peril they are in.</p>
<p>Seeing the dedication and love these volunteers have for animals and nature further inspires me to fight for the red apes and gives me hope that together we might win.</p>
<p>To volunteer for OFI visit www.orangutan.org[http://www.orangutan.org]</p>

imagined she'd be directing a team of eight on construction projects

<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>1157 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>E1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>If the H1N1 flu becomes widespread this fall, businesses would be wise to sharpen their telephone skills and use Internet sales and marketing, an expert says.</p>
<p>Chuck Weinberg, professor of marketing at the University of B.C.'s Sauder School of Business, believes use of available media will help get companies through a period when fewer customers may venture into stores and employee absenteeism becomes an issue.</p>
<p>"The response, particularly from retailers, to people not coming into stores would be for companies to beef up their online and their telephone-selling aspects of their operation," Weinberg said. "You will need a high level of service on the telephone. You should have your telephone selling on the ready, and have a marketing campaign that says, 'We're still here, and here are the ways we can serve you.'"</p>
<p>Telephone and online marketing are options for retailers, but what about other businesses? Who is most vulnerable when it comes to widespread illness or even a pandemic?</p>
<p>Small companies are at risk. If you have only four people at your office and two are sick, your business could be in serious trouble. Service industries whose employees must be there to serve the public are also vulnerable. If you run a restaurant and your chef, bartender and half your servers are sick at home, you will have a tough time.</p>
<p>But Ian Tostenson, president and CEO of the B.C. Restaurant and Foodservices Association, doesn't believe restaurants are vulnerable because his industry has high standards for cleanliness and hygiene.</p>
<p>"H1N1 will require an awareness, but it's not going to make any substantial changes to current operating procedures in restaurants," Tostenson said.</p>
<p>"Restaurants' benchmarks for cleanliness standards are a lot higher than any business office, because they have to be," he said.</p>
<p>"Cleanliness, sanitation and food safety are top of the line for a restaurant. They work hard to ensure they comply with all the food-safe training [requirement], and comply with health board regulations. They are highly regulated and highly inspected."</p>
<p>Tostenson says in the restaurant business, any worker with the sniffles would be asked to go home, even outside of flu season.</p>
<p>Companies that aren't in the service business can do things to get through a flu outbreak. They can encourage employees to telecommute, working out of home while they get well or while they look after flu-ridden members of their families.</p>
<p>Companies that need meetings would be best to do them in an environment where group assemblies in a single room are not needed, such as by telephone conference, video conferencing, or Skype.</p>
<p>"I meet with two or three people on Skype rather than have to meet them [face to face]," said Sauder's Weinberg.</p>
<p>Doug Alley, vice-president of human resources for the Business Council of B.C., believes that because we've been through a number of flu scares in recent years, many businesses are prepared. Most have hand-washing stations and signage, or have contingency plans in case of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Common sense should rule.</p>
<p>"I think people are going to be very prudent," Alley said. "If someone came into this office and wasn't feeling well, we would say, 'Don't be around me. Keep your flu at home.'"</p>
<p>A restaurant with only a handful of employees that gets hit by the flu would definitely struggle, but Alley believes the industry is more likely to suffer from a public unwilling to go out into a crowd environment.</p>
<p>"There could be layoffs or closures because people aren't going out, as opposed to closures because people are sick," said Alley, who maintains that most industries are prepared for the flu season.</p>
<p>"I think people have a pretty good idea of what to do and what not to do," he said.</p>
<p>However, a Harris/Decima survey by the <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> this week revealed only one in 10 small-business owners was prepared for an H1N1 outbreak. The poll of 807 small-business owners who have fewer than 50 employees found that while half had some kind of contingency plan for emergencies, 82 per cent did not have a plan to deal with an emerging health problem, and 90 per cent had not addressed H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Small Business BC has issued a set of tips for small business owners on how to deal with emergencies such as a flu pandemic. These include paying for flu shots, diversifying the company's supply chain, enforcing a sick leave policy, encouraging telecommuting, and cross-training employees so they can do the work of a sick colleague.</p>
<p>Candice Macalino, communications manager for Small Business BC, recommends companies purchase business interruption insurance, which covers illness, from a commercial business broker.</p>
<p>There is no vaccination yet for H1N1 flu, but if one becomes available companies should encourage employees to get a shot earlier rather than later, said Jim Brander, professor of economics at the Sauder School of Business. Larger companies could arrange for a public health nurse to come to the office, while smaller companies could arrange a time when employees can attend a local clinic to get their shot.</p>
<p>mandrews@vancouversun.com</p>
<p>WHAT YOUR BUSINESS CAN DO</p>
<p>Aside from encouraging basic health practices such as washing hands and keeping a clean office environment, here are some of the strategies that can help you mitigate your business risk during a heightened flu season:</p>
<p>- Pay for employees' annual flu shots, and H1N1 shots when they become available.</p>
<p>- Provide anti-bacterial hand-sanitizers in the washrooms.</p>
<p>- Provide employees with disinfectant wipes for telephones and other objects that may be shared in the workplace.</p>
<p>- Enforce a sick-leave policy. Encourage your employees to stay home if they are sick or feel unwell.</p>
<p>- Spread workers out so they can avoid close contact (within two metres).</p>
<p>- Encourage telecommuting if practical for your organization.</p>
<p>- Use the Internet and the telephone to make sales to customers.</p>
<p>- Diversify your supply chain so that you are not dependent on one company that could be struck by a flu outbreak.</p>
<p>- Cross-train employees so that any surprise illnesses can be covered.</p>
<p>- Conduct meetings by conference calls, Skype or video conferencing.</p>
<p>- Increase your quality checks.</p>
<p>- Adjust your production to meet changing supply or demand.</p>
<p>- Maintain close communications with suppliers and customers so that they know the status of your business, and you know theirs.</p>
<p>- Get business interruption insurance from a commercial business broker.</p>
<p>- Keep an updated list of emergency contact information, and make medical advice available to employees.</p>
<p>- It can be problematic for some workers, but basic over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol or Tempra) for fever can be provided. In expectation of shortages, get two or three months' supply.</p>

</div><div>Bruce Constantineau   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun; with files from Canwest News Service</div>
<div>926 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Swine flu fears prompted a Brazilian judge this month to order fans attending a soccer match between Santos and Curitiba to wear masks. Otherwise, the game would have been closed to the public.</p>
<p>In England, the Football Association and Premier League have drawn up plans to ban crowds at live sports events in the case of a serious outbreak. Clubs went through a similar process during the 2006 bird flu crisis but did not have to put those plans into operation.</p>
<p>North American sports leagues -- including hockey, football, basketball and university sports -- will ramp up during the flu season this fall and winter but few are planning for worst-case scenarios that would see games or seasons cancelled and millions of dollars of revenues lost.</p>
<p>The National Hockey League's response is typical.</p>
<p>"We've focused on it and met internally to discuss the matter but at this time we have no firm 'cancellation' or other contingency plan in place," NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said in a statement. "We will continue to monitor the situation and step up our preparation efforts if and when it becomes necessary."</p>
<p>If and when a flu shot for the H1N1 virus is available, NHL players will be encouraged to get it, but NHL teams don't have the power to make it mandatory.</p>
<p>NHL players are constantly flying because of their travel schedule, but Dr. Mark Aubry, the Ottawa Senators' team physician and chief medical officer for the International Ice Hockey Federation, says that doesn't make them any more likely to catch the virus than the general population.</p>
<p>"Most of the time, when you're talking about influenza, it usually affects the population which is at the most risk, the people whose immune system is at risk, but with the H1N1 virus, initially in the beginning, it was affecting so called 'normal, healthy' people," he said. "But as we have gone down the road, very few people have died and most of the people who have been affected are the very young or the very old, who can't fend for themselves as well. There's no recipe. We just have to follow the recommendations from the health organizations."</p>
<p>University of B.C. health, safety and environment director David Zajdlik said the university would take direction from local health authorities about what to do with sporting events, classes and other public gatherings in the event of a serious flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"We wouldn't do anything unilaterally," he said. "We know that if things really progress in terms of the number of people affected, there may be some directive on limiting gatherings so we're talking about how to do that - whether or not sporting events happen in front of an empty stadium."</p>
<p>Canadian Football League chief operating officer Michael Copeland said H1N1 was discussed at a recent meeting of CFL club presidents because they know it could become a more significant issue this fall.</p>
<p>He said clubs will work closely with provincial health authorities and then decide the best course of action if the league is advised not to hold public gatherings.</p>
<p>"If a pandemic were to occur, we'd have to decide whether to stage games without fans in the stands or cancel them outright," Copeland said. "That decision would require further input from our broadcast partners and the clubs."</p>
<p>But he said the CFL would likely prefer to cancel games and try to reschedule them later, rather than play in empty stadiums.</p>
<p>"It would be a last resort [to play with no fans] and it may not be the best representation of the game and the product," Copeland said. "You can't extend the length of the season so you might have to lose the games for that season."</p>
<p>He said the league could try to squeeze in rescheduled games between other games later in the season but that would be difficult because it would affect players' preparation time and recovery time.</p>
<p>"There's always concern over something like this but it's far too early to become overly concerned," Copeland said "It's just prudent to think about these things in advance and be prepared."</p>
<p>He said if CFL players become infected with H1N1, club doctors would decide when they could return to the team with no danger of infecting their teammates.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Galaxy and U.S. international soccer star Landon Donovan became infected with the virus early this month but barely missed any game action. He played the second half of a game against Seattle shortly after his diagnosis and started games after that.</p>
<p>Vancouver Whitecaps president Bob Lenarduzzi said fan safety is first and foremost but the team and USL-1 have no hard and fast plans at this point. He said the team would play games without fans if it had to.</p>
<p>"Of the two scenarios - canceling games or playing with no fans - we'd likely play the game because you really don't have time to extend your season," Lenarduzzi said. "Then you would look to credit people like season ticket holders."</p>

<p>HOW TO SELL</p>
<p>BY CLANCY MARTIN</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Farrar, Straus and Giroux</span>/ Douglas & McIntyre, 296 pages ($30)</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>It's a curious paradox: We're drawn, in narrative art, to the things that terrify or alienate us in reality. The psychology which holds that the distancing of entertainments such as books or films allows the reader or viewer to confront darker aspects of the world safely doesn't quite hold. It doesn't explain the power of the draw we feel to that darkness.</p>
<p>Take global epidemics. You need only consider the panic over swine flu to recognize that pandemics are one of our foremost contemporary fears. And yet Vancouver writer Daniel Kalla's pandemic-based thrillers are bestsellers and Stephen King's plague epic, The Stand, is widely regarded as his finest hour.</p>
<p>Similarly, real-life serial killers -- the Clifford Robert Olsons and the Paul Bernardos -- fill us with fear and loathing, but we are powerfully drawn to similar figures in literature: Thomas Harris's Dr. Hannibal Lecter is practically a folk hero. (And don't get me started on vampires). And then there are confidence men.</p>
<p>Nobody likes to be scammed, and these days it feels as if conmen are all around us. From Nigerian phishing e-mails to identity theft to fallen corporate titans, we're wary of being ripped off. And yet, in books and film -- from the Depression-era whimsy of The Sting to the suave cool of Ocean's Eleven to the intricacies of the grift in Will Ferguson's 2007 novel, Spanish Fly -- everyone is a fan of the con game.</p>
<p>With his debut novel, How to Sell, Missouri writer and philosophy professor Clancy Martin strips back the veneer of the genteel con and wallows in the squalid reality of small-time jewelry scams and the human wrecks who perpetrate them.</p>
<p>How to Sell begins with 16-year-old Bobby Clark getting kicked out of his Alberta high school after attempting to pawn a case of stolen class rings.</p>
<p>When his relationship with his girlfriend implodes, Bobby heads south to take a job at the Fort Worth Deluxe Diamond Exchange with his older brother, Jim. From the moment of his arrival, when Jim greets him at the airport with a limousine, his sexy saleswoman mistress Lisa and a bottle of cocaine, Bobby is drawn into a world of (relatively) low-stakes fraud, drugs and sex. With his instincts for deception, he emerges as a naturally gifted salesman.</p>
<p>He also falls into a relationship with Lisa based on their mutual interest in drugs and sex. His habitual pilfering leads to a crisis that shifts the action of the novel halfway through.</p>
<p>How to Sell is a powerful, smart debut. The characterizations are deep and insightful without being laboured: Bobby might read philosophy in his off-time, but his character is delineated not through ideas but through his actions.</p>
<p>Most impressive is the verisimilitude. The scenes in the jewelry stores, and the cons, are small masterworks of tension and sleight-of-hand. They're written with a depth that only someone with personal knowledge can provide.</p>
<p>This is no accident: How to Sell is rooted in Martin's own experience in the grey-market jewelry trade. Now that those days -- working with his older brother, preying on the unwary -- are behind him, the 42-year-old writer has turned the rawest of materials into a novel that is at once brutal and redemptive.</p>
<p>One wonders, though: Can the redemptive movements of a conman ever be truly trusted? When the game is as good as How to Sell, it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>Readers will be pleased to have this particular wool pulled over their eyes.</p>
<p>Victoria writer Robert Wiersema's horror novella, The World More Full of Weeping, will be published by ChiZine next month.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 won't be a major crisis if we plan ahead; Prevention will work much better than cure in dealing with pandemic</b>
</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>1009 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Now that the flu season is nearly upon us, and given that this year we need to deal with the H1N1 virus in addition to the seasonal flu, it's important the every individual, school, business and government is prepared.</p>
<p>The first and most important way to prepare is by arming yourself with sufficient knowledge about the virus to arm yourself against the virus.</p>
<p>Let's look at the basic facts: Every year 400 to 800 people in British Columbia, and 4,000 to 8,000 people in Canada, die from seasonal flu and/or pneumonia.</p>
<p>Further, there have been four flu pandemics in the last century. The last (before this year) occurred in 1968, and the worst in recorded history in 1918.</p>
<p>The appearance of the latest pandemic -- H1N1 -- could make this a year to remember -- or forget. But there's certainly no need to panic: Despite classifying H1N1 as a pandemic, the World Health Organization considers the severity of H1N1 to be moderate, which means most people recover without hospitalization or medical care.</p>
<p>Even in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, 97 per cent of people who took ill survived -- without antibiotics, antivirals or vaccines, which had yet to be developed.</p>
<p>That's good news. But since we do have such medicines now, it's important to put them to good use. The province has a stockpile of antivirals such as Tamiflu, which unlike vaccines are intended for people who show flu symptoms.</p>
<p>Those at high risk for contracting H1N1 -- including pregnant women, young children and people with illnesses like asthma and diabetes -- are encouraged to visit their doctors to see if the drugs should be prescribed preemptively.</p>
<p>But as always, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. And since there's no cure for the flu, the bulk of our efforts -- both individual and societal -- should be on preventing it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that's relatively easy to do, if appropriate precautions are taken. The first step is to develop a vaccine and order sufficient doses. As far as that's concerned, things look positive, since Canada has ordered 50 million doses of the vaccine from Glaxo-Smith Kline, and they should be delivered by mid-November.</p>
<p>However, it is not enough to have the vaccine on hand -- health authorities must be able to immunize people. And at present there is concern that there are not enough health care workers to immunize people in time, since the flu season generally begins in December.</p>
<p>Aware of this, the B.C. and Alberta governments are considering using pharmacists to provide injections. This is a promising idea, but it will require providing pharmacists with advance training, and that must take place sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>That not all provinces are considering this reveals a chink in our armour against the disease. Since health care is a provincial responsibility, there is the possibility that different provinces will respond differently to the flu, which could prove disastrous in the case of an emergency.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer, David Butler-Jones, acts as a facilitator to bring together people from across the country when we're faced with things like an infectious disease outbreak.</p>
<p>However, Butler-Jones doesn't have the power to make binding decisions in a time of crisis.</p>
<p>The Canadian Medical Association recognized this problem in 2004 when Butler-Jones was appointed, and it recommended enacting legislation to give him clear legal powers in a time of crisis. But nothing was done, and the Canadian Medical Association Journal recently renewed calls for the appointment of a national health czar with legal authority to impose directives of provinces during a pandemic.</p>
<p>This is something the federal government should put its mind to, since coordination is essential in times of emergency. But coordination must exist, not only among governments, but also among governments, schools, businesses and individuals.</p>
<p>The B.C. Ministry of Education has developed a pandemic response framework which includes protocols for school closures, continuity of instruction if schools are closed, transportation of sick students and post-pandemic recovery.</p>
<p>Although it is more difficult to coordinate businesses, all employers should ensure that their employees are aware of the symptoms of the flu, as well as how to prevent it. Businesses should discourage people from attending work if they feel ill, and should have plans in place in case a significant number of employees are unable to go to work. And in the interests of prevention, they should make hand sanitizers available and encourage their use.</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, individuals need to protect themselves. Since help might not arrive for up to 72 hours after the onset of a major crisis, individuals need to ensure they have an emergency supply kit with medical supplies and enough food and water for three days.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus is not likely to be a major crisis, though, if individuals take the necessary precautions. This means ensuring everyone in the family, especially children, know the symptoms of the flu, and follow rules of good hygiene, including washing hands thoroughly and frequently, coughing and sneezing into a tissue, staying at home when feeling sick, and keeping a distance from others who are ill.</p>
<p>If everyone were to follow these simple precautions, there would be much less risk of a major crisis. And even if a major crisis does occur, if everyone is prepared for it ahead of time, it will be much easier to come out of it alive and well.</p>

</div><div>Tom Spears   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>568 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Tamiflu is birth control for flu viruses, and every country in the world is stockpiling it -- but this pill won't work forever.</p>
<p>Tamiflu (also known as oseltamivir) is one of a class of drugs called antivirals. Another such drug for flu is called Relenza, although Tamiflu is more common and better known.</p>
<p>They don't cure flu, but can make it run its course faster than without treatment, and with less severe symptoms.</p>
<p>Here's how they work.</p>
<p>A virus is a stowaway inside your cells. It enters a human cell and uses the cell as a place to multiply into thousands of new viruses, using the human cell as raw material and a sort of maternity ward combined. Then the new viruses are released from the surface of the cell, and spread to more cells.</p>
<p>An antiviral drug does not attack and kill the original virus. Instead, it blocks this reproductive cycle so that one virus does not become thousands.</p>
<p>The new viruses assemble on the surface of a cell, explains Earl Brown, a virologist at the University of Ottawa who has studied flu for years.</p>
<p>They are bonded to sugar molecules on the cell's outside wall. From there, an enzyme called neuraminidase cuts the chemical bonds between the newborn viruses and the cell surface. The viruses float away.</p>
<p>Tamiflu, however, blocks the action of this enzyme. The new viruses remain stuck to their original cell, so they can't spread through the body.</p>
<p>In a second effect, Tamiflu can also make viruses "clump" together like cat litter if they do escape from the original cell, again preventing them from spreading efficiently.</p>
<p>"You get a few cells infected but it stops the spread," Brown says. "That's why with Tamiflu you've got to use it in the first 48 hours (after symptoms appear) or else it's too late."</p>
<p>With all antivirals, treatment has to be early, before the disease is far advanced, he said.</p>
<p>Antivirals are nothing like antibiotics, which kill bacteria but not viruses.</p>
<p>In June, the Canadian Medical Association Journal reported that Tamiflu and Relenza (or zanamivir) are relatively safe drugs for use in pregnant and breastfeeding women. The Canadian-Japanese study leans toward Tamiflu as the first choice, saying it has more extensive safety data.</p>
<p>The bad news is that viruses can adapt to Tamiflu.</p>
<p>In July, a team from MIT and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that H1N1 could theoretically become resistant to Tamiflu with just one genetic change. That's a small jump for viruses, which mutate quickly. This, however, hasn't happened yet.</p>
<p>Still, health officials are clearly concerned that Tamiflu stockpiles could run low if the drug is wasted, and that resistance could emerge.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization recently urged countries not to give the drug to healthy people who get H1N1, unless they develop unusually severe symptoms such as pneumonia. The drug is, however, strongly recommended for pregnant women, patients with underlying medical conditions and children under five, since they are in a higher risk group.</p>
<p>At the same time, a British medical study also cautioned against over-prescribing Tamiflu or Relenza.</p>
<p>Tamiflu is made by Roche Pharmaceuticals and Relenza by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>.</p>

<p>What would you do if half of your employees suddenly couldn't come into work because of an H1N1 pandemic? I mean, other than freshening up your résumé and reviving your dormant interest in a rewarding career as a part-time coffee barista.</p>
<p>More importantly, what can you do to prepare in advance for the day when swine flu hits your business harder than Eugene Melnyk would like to punch Jim Balsillie? Unless you're running a Fortune 500 company with a department devoted to risk assessment and emergency preparedness, probably not much.</p>
<p>One of the jobs of chief executives and business owners is to know the difference between things they can and can't control. Can control: how many bottles of Purell you have in your workplace. Can't control: what happens if you suddenly lose half your team to a pandemic.</p>
<p>Realistically, most small and medium-sized businesses can't do much to prepare in advance for a big loss of employees. Even if you had the time to plan, which you probably don't, what would be in it? Subletting the space where the sales department used to sit?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the government, as always, is ready to give businesses advice. Faster than you can say Y2K, officials across North America have responded to the latest scare with a simple message: Don't panic, but this could be really, really bad. A week ago, no fewer than three U.S. cabinet ministers made a joint announcement that basically amounted to this: employers should try not to let their workers infect each other.</p>
<p>Public health officials say the next wave of H1N1 could be worse than the first, unless it's not. So the same people who reminded you to drink lots of water and seek out air-conditioning during the heat wave are now issuing documents and toolkits with pages of guidance for business owners on how to prepare for the worst.</p>
<p>The U.S. government's website, www.flu.gov[http://www.flu.gov], features a 37-page toolkit for business that recommends the following (these are direct quotes):</p>
<p>"Review your current pandemic flu plan or develop a new plan." (Uh, OK, where did I put my current pandemic flu plan again? I think I left it next to the office-struck-by-a-meteor plan.)</p>
<p>"Conduct an exercise, drill or discussion to test key components of your plan." (OK, everybody, sneeze! Now go wash your hands.)</p>
<p>"Encourage respiratory etiquette." (Frank, stop exhaling on your assistant.)</p>
<p>"Increase social distancing in the workplace." (You've heard of social networking? This is the opposite.)</p>
<p>Speaking of social media, the American toolkit offers some sample text messages for employers to send to their employees (RU not feeling gr8? OMG you should be ZZZ. TTFN.)</p>
<p>And it even gives you directions on how to wash your hands. You're supposed to do it for at least 20 seconds, or as the U.S. government tells you, the time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice. So if you find one of your employees serenading himself in the mirror above the bathroom sink, it's not that he's delirious from the swine flu or wallowing in disappointment at the lack of a surprise party. He just can't count to 20.</p>
<p>There is some good advice from government, including encouraging employers to relax their sick-day guidelines and let their workers stay home if they're not feeling well. Everybody likes a trouper, but nobody wants to sit next to a workaholic who's carrying a flu virus.</p>
<p>But otherwise, the 37 pages could be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1. Get your employees to wash their hands a lot.</p>
<p>2. Get your employees to sneeze into their elbows, the way their kids do.</p>
<p>3. Identify essential business functions and critical supply chains (e.g., raw materials, suppliers, sub-contractor services/products, and logistics) needed to keep your business running. Plan how your business will operate if a high number of employees must stay home or supply chains are interrupted.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Whether it's H1N1 or something else, most business owners have to be prepared to adapt to all kinds of surprises. So while it's helpful to remind them of the ways they can contain the spread of a potentially deadly disease, there's not much else they can really do right now.</p>
<p>And even if you do everything to prevent H1N1 from spreading among your employees, they could still be off work if their kids are sent home from school.</p>
<p>In a moment of clarity, it appears school officials have decided that's unlikely. The H1N1 virus could become a serious threat this fall or it could turn out to be nothing.</p>
<p>But while the notion of being prepared for an emergency is noble, beyond a few straightforward precautions, there's not much a small business can do to prepare for a pandemic other than be ready to adapt if necessary. And stock lots of tissue.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'I'm going to keep travelling'; ... and I was in Mexico when H1N1 began</b>
</div><div>Reb Stevenson   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>538 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>G3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>H1N1: when it broke back in April, I was in the eye of the storm. The heart of the action. The centre of the burrito.</p>
<p>Mexico.</p>
<p>My group of Canadian travel journalists was calmly taken aside by a Mexican Tourist Board representative and given a debriefing that began with something to the effect of: "Now don't freak out, but ..."</p>
<p>At that point, though, the severity of the virus hadn't hit home. Most of my companions' health concerns centred around treating today's tequila hangover and acquiring tomorrow's.</p>
<p>A few days later, we connected through Mexico City's airport and -- bam -- the panic response kicked in. That's what happens when one in three people are wearing surgical masks and your breathing holes are naked. Canadian customs in Toronto was offered no solace: the masked agents looked equipped to languish in a mustard gas sauna.</p>
<p>Like any normal individual, during the two- to seven-day incubation period that followed I convinced myself that I had swine flu.</p>
<p>Was my, um, particularly aqueous waste more than just an average Mexican souvenir? Was the minor tickle in my throat a sign to go coffin shopping -- or was it just a shard of popcorn I ate at the movie theatre (where I might have spread the pandemic to 50 innocent people who just wanted to see Anvil: The Story of Anvil)?</p>
<p>Three weeks later, I had another encounter with H1N1's global impact. I was en route to Macedonia, and of course H1N1 crossed my mind so I washed my hands frequently and resolved not to make out with any strangers on the plane (believe me, it was challenging given the romantic mood set by a choir of screaming babies).</p>
<p>At Skopje's miniscule airport, a crew of doctors in lab coats was hastily tacking up signs that instructed certain citizens -- including Canadians -- to pick up a piece of paper that ordered a check-up at a medical clinic.</p>
<p>Now, as fears mount about a possible second strain of the virus circulating this fall, people ask whether I'm going to curtail my travels. Or, at the very least, order a mask, gloves and coverall suit from www.fluarmour.com[http://www.fluarmour.com]. Maybe some disinfectant spray, too, to wield like mace against sneezy foes.</p>
<p>The answer to all of the above is: no. As long as we're healthy, there's no reason to stop travelling until the government tells us to.</p>
<p>People already cough up (excuse the pun) so many excuses for not travelling: money, time, language barriers. Adding negative hype to that list only succeeds only in wasting your own opportunities to get out there and live. Just think about everyone who quaked in their slippers and stayed put for years post 9/11.</p>
<p>I hope to meet you on a flight in the near future. But, uh ... keep the handshake to yourself please.</p>

<p>Whether they are dealing with the physical or spiritual needs of people affected by H1N1, many Ottawans will meet the virus head on. Eleven of these front-line workers took the time to tell us, in their own words, about how they plan to meet the challenges.</p>
<p>Bruce Deachman took their pictures and recorded their stories. Read them here and on the following pages and hear them online at ottawacitizen.com.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Terry MacIver</p>
<p>Executive director,</p>
<p>The <span class="companylink">Children's Place</span> child-care centres</p>
<p>The <span class="companylink">Children's Place</span> has been in operation since 1981 and I've been in charge since 1981. I don't work directly with the children -- I develop and create programs.</p>
<p>Over the years we've expanded to include a day-care centre that also provides care for 24 hours, seven days a week.</p>
<p>Most of what I enjoy about what I do are the challenges. They're daily challenges -- providing care for children that many other centres aren't interested in doing or are not skilled or trained in, and as an administrator ... it allows me to develop the budgets behind this, the staffing for these programs. I think with the challenges that it offers in doing 24/7, it's kept me pretty busy over the years.</p>
<p>I think the most current challenge that's coming up is the H1N1 virus. I speak to that because we work with so many children who have medical needs -- we're one of the prime centres because of our size, and as a result, we can have anywhere from 10 to 15 children with medical challenges. It concerns me how the virus is going to impact these children and child care.</p>
<p>I think we're fortunate in child care because the Day Nurseries Act itself has legislation that requires us to be responsible to the Public Health Department and to meet their mandate. So when we looked at our pandemic plan, it was very obvious that we would guide the plan along the lines of direction we would be receiving. We're very limited in what we can do, because if the health department calls for us to close, we will need to close. Our biggest goal with regard to closure, is to ensure that we don't have to close entirely. We're going to be concentrating on essential services, and because we operate the 24-hour, seven-day-a-week centre, many of our families actually work in essential services in medical services, as ambulance drivers, in seniors' homes. Those staff, through a pandemic, are going to become more needed, again tying in the medically fragile children -- people in essential services have children who are medically fragile, and how can a child who has an initial fragility come to a day-care environment that may be a threat to them? So our hygiene practices, our hand-washing practices, are pretty much first-rate, I would say. I'm very proud of how our staff manage that.</p>
<p>Our pandemic plan is really just taking our outbreak policy and building on that and ensuring that the services we're going to require are in place. So it's more the external that's going to impact us, rather than the internal.</p>
<p>I think one good thing -- if you can say H1N1 is a good thing -- is that it's doing a lot of education for our families. Over the years, when we have outbreaks ... we go on a regime of teaching and educating the parents about hand-washing. Now we don't have to do that job, because it's out there. It's in the papers, it's in the media -- every time you turn around somebody's talking about H1N1, so that's actually a very beneficial thing and will help us.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Jeffrey Lepine</p>
<p>Registered nurse, General campus, Ottawa Hospital</p>
<p>I've been a registered nurse for 16 years and I'm here to say that I love my job. I like taking care of people, I like caring for people and I'm hoping to do it for many years to come.</p>
<p>I think that H1N1 is going to be adding a little bit of extra stress to the emergency department. We know how to manage it, but a stressful issue will be the numbers or volume of patients that are going to be coming in. I think we are very good at treating and taking care of flu, but the volumes are going to put more stress on us. Hospitals are already filled to their capacity, or past their capacity, so these backlogged patients are going to be left in the emergency department and we're going to be expected to care for our patients that are trauma patients, cardiac patients, stroke patients, and on top of that managing these flu patients that come in and need care as well.</p>
<p>The Ottawa Hospital is set up well, because we've implemented screeners that are there to do a fever and respiratory illness screening, and, of course, as nurses we reiterate it and we review it and we go over it again. We've got very specific protocols that we go through with isolations and whatnot, and I just hope that we're set for this flu season.</p>

<p>Sean Copeland</p>
<p>Funeral director,</p>
<p>Whelan Funeral Home</p>
<p>I'm the fourth generation at the Whelan Funeral Home, a family-owned business that my great-grandfather started in 1900. I love doing it. It's an opportunity to ... not acknowledge a death, but to acknowledge a life, to give a family an opportunity to tell their story, to gather together and celebrate, hopefully, a life well lived. I don't think any other job is as rewarding.</p>
<p>When I was back in Humber College, there was always part of the course that talked about a pandemic. That type of influenza is what we're expecting here, from what our funeral services association is preparing us for -- an increased workload; more people who ... would not recover; also young children, the vulnerable.</p>
<p>It's also difficult because -- I'm not worried about transmission here from the deceased; the virus has pretty much petered out once the death takes place -- it's the people who have been with that person who are possibly contagious. And what is a funeral but a gathering of friends and family, and that is an opportunity for that contagion to generate amongst the people who were not formerly exposed.</p>
<p>Now when you go into a funeral home or a hospital, you see the alcohol-based rub. It's pretty commonplace now, in grocery stores and shopping malls. We always have a couple of jars on hand, and what better place: a typical funeral might have 100, 150 or 200 people, who all of a sudden are brought together.</p>
<p>There was a health worker in Manitoba who said that half the population there will be exposed to this virus, and in the northern communities, funerals are not attended because there's a fear of coming in contact with the family that's already been in contact with the virus. Whether that is ... not fear-mongering, because it might have some basis in truth, but funerals and celebrations might have to be curtailed or shortened.</p>

<p>Paramedic, Ottawa Paramedic Service</p>
<p>I've been a paramedic for four years. I was at Nortel before. I'd always had an interest in medicine and helping people. When Nortel closed their division, it gave me the opportunity to go back to school and pursue my passions.</p>
<p>I love the fact that every call is different, you meet all kinds of nice people, the adrenaline of what we get to do, and helping people.</p>
<p>I don't think H1N1 is going to change the way we operate because we, as paramedics, are exposed to contagious diseases all the time. It's part of our job. Paramedic Services has provided us with standard operating procedures that keep us and our patients safe from all communicable diseases, including influenza. They were created when SARS hit Toronto. The paramedic dispatchers will ask the caller or patient over the phone to determine if they have any febrile respiratory illness symptoms, and that information is passed along to the responding paramedics so we can ensure we have adequate PPE -- personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>If we have a patient that we suspect is contagious or infected, we will pre-alert the hospital so that they can get an isolation room ready, so that nobody's caught off guard. We've all been issued and fitted with N95 masks, gloves, gowns, eye protection. We have virucidal agents or wipes in our trucks so we can decontaminate all our equipment and stretchers after patient contact.</p>
<p>We expect more calls, but it's hard to say what will happen. Perhaps more calls from nursing homes, more cases involving the elderly and children. If we have to add extra staff or work more hours, it's a service you can't just turn off.</p>
<p>I'm confident we'll be able to deal with whatever comes our way because that's what we have to do.</p>

<p>Zijad Delic</p>
<p>Imam and executive director,</p>
<p>Canadian Islamic Congress</p>
<p>I have been working as an imam in B.C., at the largest Sunni mosque, as well as an administrator at the B.C. Muslim School. During my youth, I had quite a lot of good role models. A few of them were young imams, and I think that has impacted on me greatly, as well as coming from quite a traditional Bosnian Muslim family. Of course I have developed, later on, quite a desire to serve the community. As prophet Muhammad said, the leader of a community is their servant.</p>
<p>With any disaster, I think religious communities -- specifically in Canada, this beautiful country that gives us this opportunity to share and help others -- my community, or the leadership of my community should do several things. They should focus on mobilizing the community and educating the community about the possible impact, as well as how to defend ourselves, if possible, and use all precautions and means to help ourselves be defended. No. 2, if it happens in our community we definitely, as leadership, would have to come and find ways to help those affected by it, comforting them in the process and comforting their families as well.</p>
<p>In a case of death, we definitely would be there with families and the community to guide them through the process and make it easier for them.</p>
<p>There is a statement in the Koran which we often use when we are in difficulties: "We belong to God, and to him we return." So the fact that we are born and live an allocation of time provided to us ... we have to accept that reality. Of course, if you are able to change certain things in the process while we are living and making our life happy and enjoying it, then it's OK.</p>

<p>Monsignor,</p>
<p>St-Joseph Church, Orléans</p>
<p>I really like what I'm doing. It's one of the few jobs where you are able to be very much in the lives of all sorts of people. For instance, in this parish I've got four elementary schools and one big high school, so that keeps me in touch with young people, and at the same time, I have several major organizations of seniors. So it's an interesting place to keep both sides of humanity very much in focus.</p>
<p>As for H1N1, like anything, we have to be sure we don't exaggerate it, but on the other hand it's obviously something that reminds us how important life is. That's part of the Christian message: stay alive, be thankful for what you have and keep it in good shape. Good practices of hygiene are important, a good regime of eating and so forth. All of this is a part of what good Christianity is.</p>
<p>We always hope that people will be intelligent and use their head and wash their hands and all these good things, but we also realize that people forget and, in that sense, we're there to sometimes pick up the pieces.</p>

<p>Young Israel Ottawa synagogue</p>
<p>I'm the rabbi of Young Israel Ottawa. I'm also a teacher at the Torah Institute.</p>
<p>Everybody want to have meaning in their life, and one of the nice parts about being in this type of position is that you get to see the difference that you make on a regular basis.</p>
<p>One of the areas that a rabbi is involved with is in pastoral care and chaplaincy. One of the areas I'm involved with is visitation to the hospitals, visiting sick people in old age homes, so certainly if people are, God forbid, going to contract this flu, then obviously a rabbi will be at the front lines of visiting and helping out in those situations.</p>
<p>We also perform funerals and things of that nature -- family counselling -- so depending what the outcome is and what happens with the H1N1 -- hopefully it won't be anything serious -- but if it is, it could unfortunately mean some difficult times and a lot of emotional things to deal with in terms of the congregation.</p>
<p>When a disease or anything really happens, especially on a worldwide level, we see that as a potential message from God. So the rabbis in Israel have currently called for days of penitence and fasting to combat, specifically, the H1N1, and we would take the same message over here -- even though it hasn't yet become extremely serious or hasn't exploded the way it might, the precautions that we would take is obviously giving more charity, more acts of kindness and things of that nature as a way, so to speak, to send God the message that we understand that there's a serious thing that we all need to change and improve.</p>

<p>Mark Reardon</p>
<p>Emergency physician,</p>
<p>General campus, Ottawa Hospital</p>
<p>I've been practising emergency medicine now for about 25 years, or longer actually. I like the variety and the the people aspect of it. It's always extremely challenging. I still get in cases that I've never seen before.</p>
<p>When we're looking at H1N1, and we're sort of expecting something around this fall, the biggest impact is going to be plugging up the Emergency. The real problem comes with the number of hospital beds that are free. Our occupancy rate is extremely high; we're looking at 100 per cent-plus most of the time.</p>
<p>That means that we can't move patients that are admitted from the Emergency into the hospital. Our Emergency beds fill up and then we can't move patients from the waiting room in to be seen in the Emergency itself. It's like a chain reaction, and translates into huge waiting times and, basically, people not getting treated that should be treated. That's a big problem.</p>
<p>If you add H1N1 to that -- we're expecting probably hundreds if not thousands of patients to come in -- you're going to increase the pressure in the front doors of the Emergency. What we really need to do is work on our occupancy and freeing up beds upstairs.</p>
<p>We have somewhat of an idea that it doesn't seem to be as bad a flu virus as, say, SARS or something like that. But I still think we're going to see huge congestion in the Emergency because of these factors.</p>

<p>Eleanor Sutherland</p>
<p>Family doctor</p>
<p>I've been in practice for a long time. In family medicine mainly, but all sorts of medicine. One of the ones I enjoyed the most was rehabilitation medicine, which is people who were in wheelchairs or had big disabilities. That I studied for at least four years in Regina.</p>
<p>I've had a passion all my life. I get a lot of satisfaction from it. A lot of sadness, too. It's sad to diagnose people with cancer and stuff like this, and to see young people die. But everybody I see does the best they can, and I think that's the way doctors are. They work hard and they really, really care.</p>
<p>H1N1, I think it's something like ... I was involved years ago with the big polio epidemic, and you never knew who was going to get it. They would walk in one day and be dead the next. It was a very horrible, scary thing, that one. It would be maybe one member of the family and not other people in the family.</p>
<p>I think in some ways that this flu is going to be somewhat similar and just as bad. I was on the prairies then, and it seemed to me they had two big epidemics -- one in Winnipeg first, and then the second one was in Edmonton. They had to fly the iron lungs in from Winnipeg to Edmonton when the polio epidemic went there.</p>
<p>It was a scary time. It was a time when people just didn't know. The schools closed, which I thought was a good idea, until the epidemic was over. Beaches closed and people tried to not mix too much. People say they can't do that (now). They're against that kind of thing. I think once the epidemic starts -- if the epidemic starts -- they'll have to do that.</p>

<p>Claudia McKeen</p>
<p>Pharmacist and owner,</p>
<p>Glebe Apothecary</p>
<p>I've owned the business since I started it 25 years ago ... it's a calling, like teaching or nursing. You're always helping people out, you're always trying to resolve problems. It's not counting, pouring, licking and sticking, like it used to be. You're front-line. On a weekend you may be triaging. People come in and say, "Will you look at this? Will you look at my foot? I've got a really sore shoulder. I can't move my back. What should I do?" We try to assess them quickly and see in what direction they should be going.</p>
<p>I'm looking at H1N1 no differently than the seasonal flus, except it's year-round right now. We see waves of illness and people coming in who are sick that, in other summers, we wouldn't have seen. But it doesn't seem to be as severe as the seasonal flus.</p>
<p>Many, many people are carrying it. It is a pandemic. So our role as pharmacists is to teach infection control and remind people of the basics if they have it and how to prevent the spread of it. So we're on 12-month alert instead of November to April.</p>
<p>I think that what we have to look at is prepare for the worst and be ready, and then we're fine with whatever hits us.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm underwhelmed by it all. I simply don't think ... people are not going to be dropping dead in the streets from this thing. We're going to have people sick with colds and sore throats and respiratory infections, and the usual suspects will be who gets hit by the flu every winter.</p>
<p>At the same time, of course we'll be prepared. I'm working on a plan for my store, because if I have a few people out, that can really affect how I can deliver good service to our customers who need us. We've implemented things over the years for infection control, where we spray down the phones and keyboards every few hours during flu season. We're constantly spraying our countertops with alcohol. We have hand cleansers on the wall for the public and staff to use.</p>
<p>We've been advised by our pharmacy associations to have supplies in the pharmacy for staff to use, in terms of masks and gowns and things like that. We already have that here because we have it for our lab. I can't imagine that it would get to the point where my staff are wearing masks, but I guess it would depend on how many of my employees are sick.</p>
<p>I will certainly encourage people to get a vaccine.</p>

<p>I've been here about eight years. I've been a nurse for 30. I like the work we do at the community health centre because we have an opportunity to build relationships with clients and make a difference in a lot of lives, from birth to death. It's about looking after people when they're well, keeping them well and helping them if and when they do become ill, to manage their illness.</p>
<p>H1N1 -- certainly we're doing a lot of planning around that, planning for the worst but expecting the best. Right now we're busy planning for the potentiality of becoming a flu assessment centre if, say, Emergencies or family doctors' offices are getting such a huge surge of clients that they can't manage them. It'll be a place for people to come to be assessed and where they can access the Tamiflu, which needs to be given within 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>We're going to be busy this fall because, as always, we're going to do lots of immunizations as soon as the serum becomes available for influenza. The nurses here do a tremendous amount of telephone triage. People need to be informed. We can provide that to them or they can go to Ottawa Public Health or the Public Health Agency of Canada website.</p>

</p>
<p>In some cities, H1N1 jitters are definitely putting a damper on frosh week.</p>
<p>Take Halifax's Dalhousie University, where students have been advised to keep a "social distance" of about a metre from each other and to refrain from shaking hands, hugging and kissing.</p>
<p>It's laughable, but the fear is real.</p>
<p>Parents have been speculating about how to keep children safer, whether they're in day care or at university. Only a month ago, higher-education blogger Kathy Dobson, a Kitchener-based mother of five, noted that her two oldest children have "taken steps to minimize their exposure" including taking courses through distance education, with other courses to be taken by podcast if necessary.</p>
<p>Administrators have planned for the worst. Carleton University, for example, suggests if it's practical, sick students should go home to be isolated and cared for there. If that's not practical, students will be asked to isolate themselves in their rooms or in isolation areas to be established by the university. Dining services is already making plans to deliver meals to sick students.</p>
<p>The good news is that recent evidence suggests H1N1 will be only a health hiccup for many victims.</p>
<p>The average recovery time is three to five days. Most students would have only a handful of classes in that time period, not enough to put a significant crimp in an academic career, said Michael Histed, the University of Ottawa's director of risk management.</p>
<p>"But we have to be flexible enough so that we can adapt," he said. "That's the biggest issue."</p>
<p>Technology will make it easier for students who miss class. Some school boards and post-secondary institutions will be providing automated news to home phones and cellphones.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, from being able to access professors by e-mail to posting taped lectures for ailing students, the Internet already makes it possible for many students to stay on top of their studies without being on campus.</p>
<p>"As long as the student is well enough to be at their computer, they can work from home," said Brian Burns, director of institutional research and planning at Algonquin College.</p>
<p>By the way, for would-be froshweek revellers, hugging is safer than shaking hands, from a medical point of view, said Dr. Rick Rowland, manager of health services at Algonquin.</p>
<p>"Most people's shoulders are cleaner than their hands. Cheek to cheek, no bodily fluids."</p>
<p>University of Ottawa</p>
<p>- Number of students: 36,000</p>
<p>- Number of staff: 4,000</p>
<p>- Status: Pandemic plan posted on website</p>
<p>The university is handing out cards with the phone numbers for health agencies and the flu hotline and training workers from residence counsellors to security guards to be on the lookout for flu symptoms among students. Students who are ill will not be asked to return home, but the university will keep interactions between sick and well students to a minimum and provide sick students with a kit that includes hand sanitizer, wipes, surgical mask and gloves. The university is also developing an academic plan in case of an outbreak, including reviewing its academic and exam policies to ensure that they are flexible enough in case a large proportion of students becomes ill.</p>
<p>Carleton University</p>
<p>- Number of students: 24,300</p>
<p>- Number of staff: 2,500</p>
<p>- Status: Completing its comprehensive Pandemic Influenza Response Plan to be posted shortly</p>
<p>Carleton has a pandemic planning committee that meets weekly. The university posts updates on its website and volunteers are handing out hand sanitizer to students with their welcome packages at awareness stations in the Unicentre and in the library lobby. If classes have to be cancelled because of absenteeism, the university has an instructional television system and lectures can be made available to ailing students on the website. Systems are already in place for faculty to arrange for substitutes, if necessary, but it is unclear whether that flexibility will remain if large numbers of faculty are ill.</p>
<p>Algonquin College</p>
<p>- Number of students: 16,000</p>
<p>full-time</p>
<p>- Number of staff: about 2,000, including part-time instructors</p>
<p>- Status: Pandemic plan posted on website</p>
<p>All courses already have an online component that will be used and expanded if classes are cancelled. Administrators will keep track of flu-related absences among staff members and illnesses in residence. There are hand-sanitizing stations all over campus, and students will be reminded to wash their hands after being in computer labs, although most students now have laptops, so there is a reduced danger of students picking up the virus from keyboards. (The H1N1 virus can survive for about two days on doorknobs and keyboards.)</p>
<p>La Cité collégiale</p>
<p>Number of students: 4,000</p>
<p>Number of staff: 430</p>
<p>Status: Plan to be posted in the next two weeks</p>
<p>The French-language community college plans to initiate training sessions for staff and students in September. A committee has been created to make decisions about suspending services and classes if large numbers of students and staff are ill, in collaboration with public health officials and other colleges and universities in the region. La Cité is also in talks with faculty about delivering academic programs electronically in case of an outbreak. The college has a residence for about 300 students, who will receive training in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Ottawa Catholic</p>
<p>School Board</p>
<p>- Number of students: 39,000</p>
<p>- Number of staff: 3,800</p>
<p>- Status: Pandemic plan posted</p>
<p>The Ottawa Catholic board released a three-page document in July outlining its response to a pandemic. The board is to introduce an "intense regimen" of hand-washing and surface disinfection. School staff will also report absences of staff and students with confirmed or suspected cases. Schools may be closed if there aren't enough teachers to supervise and operate a school. The document also goes into detail about governance and financial control if senior administrators are ill.</p>
<p>French-language</p>
<p>Catholic school board</p>
<p>- Number of students: 19,000</p>
<p>- Number of staff: 2,500</p>
<p>- Status: Pandemic plan is receiving final revision and is to be posted in September</p>
<p>The board, which covers much of Eastern Ontario, is in contact with public health agencies in Ottawa, Kingston, Pembroke and Trenton. Closing schools is not anticipated, unless on the advice of public health officials. Absentee rates over 10 per cent will be reported to public health. All schools will carry out mini-lessons in hygiene practices and age-appropriate posters with visual cues have been posted in common areas where handwashing is done. Custodial staff have had supplemental training.</p>
<p>French-language public school board</p>
<p>- Number of students: 11,100</p>
<p>- Number of staff: 2,000</p>
<p>- Status: Pandemic plan to be posted in the next week</p>
<p>Schools will remain open and operating as long as possible without jeopardizing the health and safety of students and staff. Closures will be on the advice of the medical officer of health and the public health office will be notified of absences in excess of 10 per cent. A sanitation team will be dispatched to a school if there is a suspected outbreak. Extracurricular activities may be suspended or cancelled to reduce the risk of infection if their is a suspected outbreak.</p>
<p>Ottawa-Carleton</p>
<p>District School Board</p>
<p>- Number of students: 72,500</p>
<p>- Number of staff: 6,400</p>
<p>- Status: Pandemic plan posted</p>
<p>Schools with absentee levels of over 10 per cent are to report to administration at 10 a.m. every day. Four staff members have been designated as the "response team" to analyse information as it comes in, including the number of absent staff members. All hard surfaces in a classroom are to be thoroughly cleaned if a student is identified with H1N1. Director of education Lyall Thomson said earlier this month that he sees no reason to close schools. Principals will stay in contact with parents through letters, messages on school and board websites as well as an automated phone system that calls parents' homes. The school board already has 700 supply teachers on its occasional teaching list and is contemplating adding more by building a list of retired teachers available for work.</p>
<p>Day cares</p>
<p>The city of Ottawa has developed a communications network with licensed day cares to distribute information though the city's website, regular newsletters and e-mails and faxes for more pressing news.</p>
<p>If a child is ill, the city's medical officer of health, Dr. Isra Levy, urges families seek help from a family physician if possible, but to go to an emergency room if a child is suffering from shortness of breath or has a chronic illness.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada has advised child-care programs to promptly isolate children who are ill in a room or an area separate from others with adequate supervision. The agency also advises that children who are ill be sent home with their parents and not on a school bus.</p>

</p>
<p>Canada's emergency readiness for everything from pandemics to terrorism was once so poor that experts joked that Ethelred the Unready, the hapless 10th-century English king whose country was overrun time and again by foreign invaders, would be perfect as a patron saint of the country. But spurred on by a blistering Senate report that warned Canadians to gird up or pay dearly for their unreadiness, federal, provincial and city governments rose to the challenge. Five years after that report, as Canadians face the prospect of a potentially serious second wave of the H1N1 swine flu, city and emergency services that would be on the front lines of the battle -- paramedics, police and firefighters -- are as ready as they can be for what promises to be a challenging fall and winter.</p>
<p>Ottawa Paramedics</p>
<p>- Certified paramedics on the road in peak hours: 80</p>
<p>- Number on the road in off-peak hours: 48</p>
<p>- Number of calls a day: 250+</p>
<p>- Pandemic plan status: Ready</p>
<p>Of all the emergency services, the paramedics are the ones who will bear most of the burden if there is a major outbreak of the H1N1 swine flu. Not only will they be bringing the very sick to hospital, they will often be the first on the scene to attend to people who call for help. In addition, they will also be doing their normal, everyday runs. In anticipation, the paramedic service has long developed plans, systems and procedures to deal with such an eventuality, says Deputy Chief Kevin Newell.</p>
<p>Worker safety is the No. 1 priority for the service. The safety of the paramedics has to be assured not only to enable them to continue to work, but also to make sure they are not endangering people with whom they come into contact. The service has at least three months supply of vital equipment, including masks and gloves. They also have a decontamination bay where in a pandemic, the paramedics, the ambulance and the equipment on board are decontaminated after they return from service. Learning from SARS, new screening procedures and protocols have also been put in place.</p>
<p>During a pandemic, the use of aerosols or inhalers to deliver medication would be stopped or drastically reduced. Protocols are in place to use special equipment to deliver medication in liquid form. Because anywhere between 10 and 35 per cent of employees could be sick in a pandemic, succession plans are in place to ensure continuity of operations. But in a worst-case scenario, services, starting with non-essential ones like inter-hospital transfers, could be reduced. Shifts could be changed, people would be called in at different times to replace others. But since no one has any experience of what is likely to happen in a full-blown pandemic, the service will react as necessary.</p>
<p>City of Ottawa</p>
<p>- Employees: 14,000</p>
<p>- Money earmarked for emergency plan: $7 million</p>
<p>- Number of years plan took to draw up: 4</p>
<p>- Pandemic plan status: Ready</p>
<p>After years of planning, the city now has in place an emergency readiness plan as good as you're likely to find anywhere. Ottawa chief medical officer of health Dr. Isra Levy says the city is as ready as it can be.</p>
<p>The city pandemic plan rests on three principles: Preparedness, response and recovery. Each principle has protocols and procedures that spell out the roles of key institutions such as public health, hospitals and family physicians and nursing homes.</p>
<p>The plan includes: preventive measures to minimize spread of the flu, surveillance systems that allow officials to identify cases and problem areas for immediate action; systems and procedures to distribute antivirals, vaccines and other medical supplies; and isolation plans for people who are infected. Using the city plan as a template, individual municipal organizations have drawn up their own plans to suit their particular needs.</p>
<p>Ottawa Police</p>
<p>- Employees: 1,400 police officers</p>
<p>- Pandemic plan status: Ready</p>
<p>As the organization in the capital that is constantly called upon to deal with major events, the Ottawa police force hopes to draw on its enormous experience to deal with the flu outbreak. But its preparation for the second wave of H1N1 is also firmly rooted in careful emergency planning going back several years.</p>
<p>The force bases its pandemic planning on three models: 10 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent of its workforce falling sick during a flu outbreak. Each model has procedures and protocols in place to deal with replacement and redeployment of staff, continuity of operations as well as how and which services would be curtailed or stopped.</p>
<p>School and community police officers doing what would be considered non-essential services would be redeployed to patrol duties, for instance. As well, plainclothes officers would be put in uniform to do similar jobs. The service has a six-week supply of masks, gloves and other protective gear for its officers. As well, masks would be provided to prisoners who are kept in police cells. Supt. Charles Bordeleau, who is responsible for emergency operations, says dealing with a pandemic is a "big unknown" for the force but "we believe we are ready."</p>
<p>Ottawa Fire Service</p>
<p>- Number of firefighters:</p>
<p>More than 800</p>
<p>- Number of shifts: Four</p>
<p>- Average number on each shift: 160 Daily operation: One day shift,</p>
<p>one night shift; two shifts off.</p>
<p>- Pandemic plan status:</p>
<p>Work in progress</p>
<p>Ottawa firefighters are putting finishing touches to their pandemic plan to bring it in line with the city's. The new plan will include continuity of operations if many firefighters get sick, redeployment of staff and what services would have to reduced.</p>
<p>To catch potential flu carriers, temperatures of firefighters would be taken before they start work and questionnaires would have to be filled to ensure people going out on shifts are not sick, says District Fire Chief Steve O'Neil. In a serious outbreak, the department's outreach and community programs would be cancelled to free up staff.</p>
<p>Major fires and accidents would be attended to as usual, but the number of medical calls may be curtailed. Off-duty shifts could be brought in to work to make up for absentees. Holidays and leave could be cancelled, but O'Neil says it will all depend on how severe the pandemic is, and how many people fall sick.</p>

<p>- Employees: 2,800, including</p>
<p>1,650 drivers</p>
<p>- Operation: Runs a fleet of about 1,000 buses, carrying about 363,000 riders on weekdays.</p>
<p>- The plan: The city could install hand sanitizers on buses if a surge in flu cases warrants it. The city says it is emphasizing to employees the importance of frequent hand-washing or sanitizing to avoid the flu, as well as the importance of coughing and sneezing into sleeves rather than hands. The head of the city's transit committee, Alex Cullen, has argued for sanitizers on all buses because congested conditions make them a prime place for spreading the virus. So far he has not won fellow councillors' support.</p>
<p>Para Transpo</p>
<p>- Employees: 237, including</p>
<p>184 drivers (part of OC Transpo)</p>
<p>- Operation: ParaTranspo runs 91 vans and sedans and uses the services of 80 cabs to provide transportation to people who can't ride regular buses for a variety of reasons. The service provides 515,000 trips a year with its fleet and 270,000 with taxis.</p>
<p>- The plan: As with OC Transpo, there is no set plan yet, but hand sanitizers are a possibility. While some Para Transpo riders are especially vulnerable to flu, the smaller vehicles are much less crowded than regular buses.</p>
<p>Ottawa taxi fleet</p>
<p>- Employees: 2,000 drivers</p>
<p>- Operation: There are about 1,200 cabs in the city, typically shared by two drivers. A driver in a 10-hour shift picks up between 12 and 20 fares.</p>
<p>- The plan: As of Aug. 20, no preparations had been made with the city's taxi industry. Hanif Patni, president of Coventry Connections -- which runs several taxi companies -- said he is very receptive to discussions with the city. He said one logical move would be to make hand sanitizers available in all taxis.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Message to players: stay home if you're sick; The people who run kids' sports leagues are concerned about everything from handshakes to mouthguards</b>
</div><div>Chris Yzerman   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1324 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>After a hard-fought battle on the pitch, it's customary for soccer players to exchange handshakes in a gesture of goodwill.</p>
<p>With the threat of a large-scale outbreak of the H1N1 virus looming this fall and winter, however, some local indoor players may buck tradition and it won't have anything to do with a lack of sporting grace.</p>
<p>"Handshaking at the end of the game should not cause any issues and we encourage it, but if players feel they are in any danger of either passing the flu on or catching it from someone, we want to make sure everyone is comfortable in a friendly good game with no handshaking," says Paulo Bellem, chairman of the Ottawa Carleton Futsal League.</p>
<p>Last year, more than 1,800 men, women, boys and girls participated in futsal, an indoor form of five-aside soccer, at various schools and gymnasiums throughout Ottawa.</p>
<p>But faced with what health officials are warning may be a particularly harsh flu season, the league is just one of many minor sports organizations and associations in the Ottawa area that are being forced to look at ways to curb the threat.</p>
<p>"We as a league are concerned about swine flu and the effects it may have on our players," Bellem says. "We are monitoring and will continue to monitor the situation throughout the year to make sure there is nothing more we can do, for example, moving games due to an increase in the number of cases in the community and/or with our players."</p>
<p>For most, they'll start by reinforcing the message regional health officials have been trumpeting since fears of a potential pandemic arose in the spring, among them: frequent washing of hands, coughing into one's arm/elbow, and staying home if feeling sick.</p>
<p>"We will let the (team) managers and players know that it is important to be aware of how one feels and to respect others in the league, and encourage the managers to tell their players to stay home if they are not feeling well," Bellem says.</p>
<p>"We also will encourage people to bring hand sanitizers if they feel the need."</p>
<p>"Working on the prevention model is No. 1," says Brent Dick, vice-president of risk and safety for the Ottawa District Hockey Association, "following universal health precautions that the government already had in place from Day 1."</p>
<p>With minor hockey tryouts getting under way, the ODHA, and the Ottawa District Minor Hockey Association under its umbrella, is reinforcing standard practices. The need to adhere to the guidelines set out by Hockey Canada in its trainer's manual regarding the proper cleaning and drying of equipment, mouthguards and water bottles will be stressed to trainers, coaches, parents and players.</p>
<p>"We will talk to them about the equipment and the cleaning," Dick says. "There are steps in place about sanitizing equipment."</p>
<p>As tenants in buildings owned and operated either by the city or privately-owned ice pads, minor hockey associations will be reliant on the landlords for the cleanliness of dressing rooms, washroom and shower facilities, but one factor the ODMHA is considering looking into is arena temperatures.</p>
<p>"One of the questions we've posed to the Ministry of Health is the temperatures of the arenas -- is that conducive to the spread or not?" Dick says.</p>
<p>A massive headache for local hockey leagues would be a pandemic that forces the interruption of the season since there's already such a demand for ice time. Attempts at rescheduling or postponements could lead to a potential mess in the spring.</p>
<p>"That's probably a question that's not easily answered," Dick says. "Obviously, if we noticed an increase or spread, it would definitely be addressed. We don't want it to be our first recourse."</p>
<p>Todd Jackson, a senior manager in charge of safety and insurance for Hockey Canada, says parents will have a big role to play in keeping sick kids away from teammates to prevent outbreaks.</p>
<p>"We've always kind of stressed that if kids are feeling sick, stay home and not risk getting people on the team sick," he says from Hockey Canada's Ottawa office.</p>
<p>After having been hit hard by the flu bug in past seasons, the City of Ottawa Ringette Association is mindful of the warnings for an H1N1 pandemic, says risk and safety head James McMahon.</p>
<p>Like minor hockey, his association will promote World Health Organization guidelines, in addition to its trainers enforcing standards regarding mouthguards, water bottles and equipment cleaning in order to prevent outbreaks.</p>
<p>"Game forfeit is going to take on a whole new dimension," he says.</p>
<p>McMahon's family, with two children involved in ringette and two more in hockey, has even turned a wine cellar into an equipment room in order to be able to properly clean and dry equipment.</p>
<p>"You can't just leave it in the back of the car until the next game," he says.</p>
<p>Hand sanitizers will be making their appearances courtside, according to the Kanata Youth Basketball Association.</p>
<p>It held a meeting of its board of executives a few weeks ago and "generally, we want to put a lot of measures in place that are in line with health officials," including trying to ensure hand sanitizers are available at practices and games, says Dean Tanasijevic, president of the organization that will see anywhere from 800 to 1,000 kids between the ages of five and 18 sign up for its house league and competitive programs.</p>
<p>Kanata basketball will also be stressing the stay-at-home policy to its parents and coaches "if there are any kids that are showing any kind of symptom," Tanasijevic says. "Basketball is a contact sport, (but) kids are reluctant to stay at home."</p>
<p>The association intends to take steps such as meeting with its coaches to stress precautions in addition to e-mailing parents on a regular basis as information becomes available from health officials and school boards.</p>
<p>The Nepean Amateur Basketball Association's house league program and Nepean Bobcats competitive program will meet in September to discuss policy, with parents likely being expected to play a big part in taking precautions, president Harry Koch says.</p>
<p>Parents also figure big with the Nepean Corona School of Gymnastics, where, during the fall session, about 1,000 children will attend each week.</p>
<p>They're greeted with signs at the door asking them to turn back if a child is showing any signs of cough, cold or flu. Hand sanitizers have been installed throughout the building and frequent hand-washing is encouraged.</p>
<p>Coaches will keep an eye out for children showing any extra signs of fatigue or sluggishness and a daily cleaning crew looks after mats, spotting boxes and equipment such as hula hoops and balls.</p>
<p>With school back in session and people getting back to regular routines for fall, health clubs and yoga centres will see traffic pick up, and they have safeguards already in place.</p>
<p>"We have standard procedures from day to day," says Ericka Mackney, assistant general manager at GoodLife Fitness's Queensview location.</p>
<p>Those include a twice-daily cleaning crew for machines and equipment in addition to the guidelines that are standard for its members.</p>
<p>"People who come into the club if it's flu season are aware of the policies of wiping down the machines, using the hand sanitizers," Mackney says, adding that fitness clubs have a leg up since "people who work out are generally healthier because they are physically active."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The ethics of vaccination; There is a great deal of work to do to ensure wide-scale vaccination for H1N1 is carried out with beneficence, respect for autonomy, and justice</b>

</p>
<p>It was in the fall of 1976. Spurred by the discovery of a novel swine flu virus among sick recruits in a military camp and the prediction that this virus would lead to a pandemic, the U.S. government ordered a national vaccination campaign. It was an administrative success with 48 million Americans getting vaccinated in less than three months.</p>
<p>However, records show that only one person actually had died of this virus and the anticipated pandemic never materialized. In addition, the vaccine was blamed for producing hundreds of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a debilitating and otherwise rare neurological condition. The vaccination campaign was abruptly stopped after 25 people died of paralysis and respiratory failure.</p>
<p>The present scenario in the fall of 2009 is different from that of 1976. This swine flu virus has already caused a pandemic with more than 70 deaths in Canada and thousands of deaths around the world. Under these circumstances, a national vaccination campaign makes eminent sense and the federal government and its experts are to be congratulated for their foresight and efforts in securing an in-Canada vaccine production facility to meet national demand. However, if anything is to be learned from the 1976 "swine flu fiasco," it is that such a campaign has many scientific, social and ethical aspects that require careful consideration.</p>
<p>Ethically speaking, a mass vaccination program should be guided at minimum by three basic ethical principles: namely, beneficence, respect for autonomy, and justice. In applying the principle of beneficence, the program's goal ought to achieve a net benefit to the population, taking into account prevention of deaths and illnesses, as well as burdens and risks. By and large, routinely used vaccines, perfected over the years are safe and effective. But such assurance for the new pandemic vaccine must wait until it is fully tested, including clinical trials with volunteers. These tests have been scheduled, but the temptation rush things.</p>
<p>The longer the trials and the more volunteers involved, the more reliably can a vaccine's safety and efficacy be determined, since some side-effects can appear long after the injection. On the other hand, the sooner a safe vaccine is licensed for use, the more people can be protected.</p>
<p>We are told that trials will be done by November and vaccination across the country will start in December. Delays in scheduling require patience. Health authorities have the responsibility to assure themselves that the vaccine is reasonably effective and safe before asking millions of people to accept it. Safety is particularly important because the new vaccine will be offered to vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, persons with chronic illnesses and children.</p>
<p>The program also ought to be guided by the second ethical principle, the principle of respect for autonomy, which would enable people to make their own decisions about whether or not to accept vaccination, regardless of how strongly the health authorities feel about the usefulness and safety of the vaccine. Respect for persons and their intrinsic dignity requires no less.</p>
<p>In this regard, vaccination during a flu pandemic should not be different from any other medical procedure, which requires of the participant a voluntary informed consent. In order for the consent process to be informed, candidates for vaccination will need to be given estimates of anticipated benefits and foreseeable risks. A blanket reassurance such as "trust me, it is good for you" is not acceptable; people must be given the facts and figures acquired from new clinical trials and past historical experiences, and their questions should be responsibly answered.</p>
<p>Professionals responsible for vaccination need to ensure that participants understand the information. For example, vaccinated people may erroneously believe that a vaccine provides 100-per-cent protection, while 60- to 80-per-cent protection would be a more realistic expectation. If people sign the consent form with an incorrect impression, they may become careless and not take the usual precautions against infecting themselves or others.</p>
<p>Hopefully, somewhere there is a group of experts that is already composing a consent form that includes all relevant information that can assist people in making a decision about getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>In applying the third ethical principle, the principle of justice, the vaccination program must focus on a just and fair distribution and administering system. The federal decision to offer the vaccine to every Canadian has reduced concerns about unjust distribution. However, because the whole population cannot be vaccinated at once, the pandemic planners have established a needs-based distribution scheme by dividing the population into groups defined by occupation, level of risk, and age. To date, there is no federal-level recommendation about which of these subgroups will receive the vaccination first.</p>
<p>To determine priority group distribution, many factors will have to be considered. However it is important that the responsible authorities arrive at their decision in a very public, transparent and justified manner. Yet, creating appropriate groups and order of priority does not guarantee that justice is fully served.</p>
<p>It is important that the method of delivery is just and fair. If, for example, persons with a high risk of complication from influenza are given priority for vaccination, it is necessary to identify them by name, based on their actual health condition, and notify them about the vaccination offer. Some will be in institutions, many in their homes, and some will lack the ability to go to vaccination clinics.</p>
<p>Vaccine administration will be further complicated when trying to administer to those with communication challenges or disabilities, and by individuals or groups who may try to gain an unfair advantage. Do we have enough people in the health-care system who are designated for this task and getting ready to carry it out?</p>
<p>One group which justifiably may be given priority vaccination is front-line health-care workers, but this will not be free of ethical problems. For example, if a health-care worker receives priority vaccination, it would seem to create a reciprocal ethical obligation to serve.</p>
<p>How should we respond, if at the height of the pandemic such a person is unwilling to work? Even more problematic is the scenario where a physician or nurse refuses the pandemic vaccination. This is not an unlikely scenario, because more than 50 per cent of these professionals refuse the yearly flu vaccination which is highly recommended and promoted.</p>
<p>For health-care workers, the decision to vaccinate is not just a personal decision. They are offered the vaccine not only to diminish their chance of disease and death, but also to maintain their health in order that they are available to serve. Even more importantly, vaccination will reduce the risk of their transferring the virus from patients with the flu to patients who have other health problems. Unvaccinated health-care workers at the height of a pandemic would likely put their patients at risk -- an ethically most problematic situation.</p>
<p>Legal enforcement of vaccination is the last measure to consider. The first step is for all colleges of health-care professions to consider if the acceptance of vaccination should or should not be declared an ethical obligation of the professionals they oversee. Another important, justice-related issue is to consider offering compensation to those who are injured by vaccination. Even if the vaccine is reasonably safe, there is the possibility that, of the many millions who receive it, some will experience adverse effects which can be debilitating. Is it fair that such people be burdened by both a personal injury and the economic consequences?</p>
<p>A good argument could be made that we all should share some of that risk and that Parliament ought to adopt a law instituting a no-fault compensation system, similar to those for motor vehicle accidents. A number of American states as well as the province of Quebec already have such a statute in place.</p>
<p>A great deal needs to be done so that a pandemic vaccination program can benefit the population to the greatest degree, be respectful of individuals, and be delivered with justice. During such a crucial time, an ethically sound pandemic vaccination program can foster solidarity and help us emerge from the pandemic crisis a more cohesive and humane society.</p>

</p>
<p>The politically correct term is now "H1N1." The original term, "swine flu" -- which caught on spontaneously, in all the European languages at least -- has been ruled politically incorrect. (I especially enjoyed the German version -- so that I was referring to the flu consistently in private conversation several months ago as Die Schweinegrippe!)</p>
<p>This was among the major decisions reached by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international authorities. Indeed the WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) combined forces on this last month, in urgent teleconferences. They pooled international expertise on political correctness in disease-naming. All progressive persons have now complied. It would be sad if millions of people died in an influenza pandemic; but how much worse if it were carrying a name that detracted from the dignity of pigs.</p>
<p>From what I can gather, as a civilian, it is anyway a mongrel virus, with genetic sequences suggestive of North American influenzas both swine and avian, plus the Eurasian swine, and the general human. In other words, "swine flu" was only approximately correct. Whereas, "H1N1" is generically vague, and thus nearly meaningless. The term applies to the subtype of the influenza virus A that has been the cause of every major flu pandemic since La Pessadilla of 1918-19, along with half of the flu infections that arrive each fall.</p>
<p>These latter incidentally kill quite a few people, mostly invisibly to the media. For there is nothing exciting about the fall flu season.</p>
<p>Diseases are generally boring. Deaths from a major earthquake, flood or typhoon, will get proportionally much more coverage; and deaths from human acts of violence far more, in proportion to their numbers. My formula is: the more we could have done something about it, the more interesting the event will seem.</p>
<p>That "Spanish flu" of 1918-19 -- which infected perhaps one-third of the world's population, and killed up to one-fifth of those -- focused chiefly on healthy young adults. Perhaps 100 million died. There is no way to establish an accurate number, but this was possibly more than the Black Death of the 14th century, in volume, if not proportion to previous population. More, by far, than died violently in the course of the Great War, and yet the sufferings in the trenches play a larger part in our historical memory. Wars seem more consequential, regardless of the casualty count. The fallout from a plague is subtler, having demographic consequences down the historical road. But wars create immediate changes on the ground -- and memorably for the worse, or better.</p>
<p>This struck me when reading English mediaeval history. Perhaps one-third of the English were wiped out in the "Great Pestilence" of 1348-50, and many villages disappeared from the landscape. (In other parts of Europe, three-quarters or more of the people were lost, and whole regions became de-populated). The event hardly went unnoticed, but it is not writ so large in contemporary accounts. Dynastic changes take precedence in the chronicles. The fallout from the plague is nearly ignored: such demographic effects as the loss of all the clergy in many places, who had to expose themselves repeatedly in the course of delivering last rites; the sudden loss of cultural continuities that this entailed.</p>
<p>The Black Death was an act of nature, from which the recovery was equally natural. By the end of that 14th century, silent baby booms seem already to have replaced most of the missing people. Life went on, gaps and niches filled. It went on after every revisitation of the bubonic plague, in centuries thereafter. Our ancestors took these things in their stride.</p>
<p>Should we? Granting, of course, that we should do whatever is in our power to limit death and suffering -- as human beings have always done, according to their lights -- should we give the matter more or less weight than our ancestors did?</p>
<p>There was a tendency in the past, especially the Christian past, to look upon plagues, and every other unavoidable disaster, as acts of divine judgment. This is easy enough to understand, for in the best of times most of us deserve hanging, and the prospect of mortality has ever helped to concentrate the mind.</p>
<p>Today, with an unquestionably improved understanding of the material causes of infection, we are inclined to think of ourselves, when sick and likely to die, as pure victims of nature. We easily forget that on that account, by our very existence, we are pure beneficiaries of nature, and what is taken away can be no more than what was given. In the old Christian account, "each of us owes a death."</p>
<p>It is a paradox, worth pondering, that with such "backward" attitudes, and suspicions of divine retribution, our ancestors may have done a better job of coping with disaster.</p>
