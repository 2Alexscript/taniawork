<p>Although the H1N1 pandemic has proven to be a mild one so far, it would be a mistake to downplay the threat it poses, says one of Canada's top public health experts.</p>
<p>Kumanan Wilson, Canada Research Chair in public health policy at the University of Ottawa, said Canada must not repeat the mistakes that were made during past public-health emergencies, such as the SARS outbreak and the tainted-blood scandal, and that the fundamental ethos of public health--the precautionary principle--must be applied.</p>
<p>"We have to assume the worst-case scenario in public health because the worst-case scenarios in public health, they don't affect a few people, they affect large populations with potentially catastrophic results," he said in an interview with Canwest News Service and Global National. "One of the mistakes we made with the blood system and the tainted-blood scandal was downplaying the risk, waiting for better evidence, not overreacting...and the results were somewhat catastrophic," he said.</p>
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the national blood supply was contaminated and tens of thousands of Canadians were infected with hepatitis C and some with HIV.</p>
<p>The emergence of the new strain of the H1N1 virus in the spring, and its quick migration around the globe that prompted the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic, has been driving fear and panic that this is the deadly flu experts have been predicting for years. Governments around the world are mounting massive responses and are spending billions of dollars to fight the virus, also called the swine flu.</p>
<p>Individual cases of swine flu are not being tracked, so it's impossible to know how many Canadians have caught the bug, but more than 1,400 people have been hospitalized and of those, almost 300 were admitted to an intensive care unit. The virus has been linked to 76 deaths. The regular seasonal flu is estimated to cause about 20,000 hospitalizations every year and up to 4,000 deaths, mostly in elderly people or those with underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>The novel H1N1 strain is acting differently than the seasonal flu because it seems to favour younger, healthy people and can cause severe illness in them.</p>
<p>In response to some critics who are asking whether all of the flu hype is overblown, Wilson said public health officials "had no choice" but to take the steps they have because the virus had never been seen before and its behaviour is unpredictable.</p>
<p>"In retrospect, I think it's going to be better to look like we overprepared than underprepared," he said.</p>
<p>Public health officials say the key to stopping the pandemic in its tracks is to vaccinate and they are encouraging Canadians to get the H1N1 pandemic shot when it becomes available in November. Not everyone is keen to get vaccines, however, particularly this one because the safety testing will not be as thorough as it normally would be in a non-pandemic scenario.</p>
<p>Wilson said a vaccine injury compensation program is needed in Canada for people who may be harmed by it, or any other vaccine. That would help encourage the public to buy into any mass immunization program, but Quebec is the only jurisdiction in Canada that has a no-fault program.</p>
<p>"I think the No. 1 reason to bring this program in is an issue of fairness," he said. Vaccination is not mandatory in Canada but if that were to change, or, if certain populations like health-care workers were required to get the shot, Wilson said it's only fair they be compensated if something were to go wrong with the vaccine. Going through the justice system and launching lawsuits is an uneven and ineffective method of getting compensated, he added.</p>
<p>The debate about whether certain people should be required to take the shot extends beyond health-care workers and has many parents wondering what would happen if they choose not to have their child vaccinated. They may be facing off with parents who think it's irresponsible to forgo the shot.</p>
<p>"This could cause a lot of tension in schools," said Wilson.</p>
<p>Parents are allowed to get exemptions for routine childhood vaccinations, such as the measles and mumps shot, but if there's an outbreak schools have the authority to send children home that don't have their shots.</p>
<p>"We could see a similar scenario if the H1N1 outbreak worsens," said Wilson.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer said on Friday that 1.8 million doses of unadjuvanted swine flu vaccine have been ordered for pregnant women and children under the age of three. The move recognizes that not enough clinical data exists on the safety and effectiveness of adjuvanted vaccines in these groups, Dr. David Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>Decisions about whether schools will be sites for the H1N1 immunization program are up to local public health authorities.</p>
<p>Wilson said public health officials have already taken many of the steps that are needed to protect the public, such as ordering enough vaccine for the whole population.</p>
<p>"What we have to be careful (of) now is making sure that the measures that we bring in to protect against the harms of the virus are not harmful in and of themselves," he said. "We don't want to introduce unnecessarily harmful measures if this virus does not turn out to be that bad."</p>

<p>Most Canadians are practical sorts. We understand that the only thing worse than the United Nations, with all its frustrations and failures, would be a world without one. That's been tried before, and it didn't work out so well.</p>
<p>But there are days....</p>
<p>Witness Wednesday's opening fall session, when sensible, even inspired addresses to the General Assembly by the likes of Barack Obama and Nicolas Sarkozy were joined by bilge spewed by Libyan "king of kings" Moammar Gadhafiand Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</p>
<p>Any thoughts that the Libyan dictator might have repaired his image somewhat of late were scuttled recently by the hero's welcome his regime gave convicted Lockerbie mass murderer Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi. The reconstruction project further flamed out in the absurd rant Gadhafiinflicted on delegates Wednesday, rife with insights such as variously identifying the H1N1 virus as a military weapon created in a laboratory or a blight invented by pharmaceutical companies so they can profit on developing a vaccine.</p>
<p>Spending six times his time allotment, the rambling caped crusader accused the Security Council of being an al-Qaida-like terrorist cell, and argued that Tony Blair and George W. Bush be tried as war criminals. While he was at it, he demanded to know who killed John F. Kennedy.</p>
<p>For his part, Holocaust denier Ahmadinejad used his moments to fulminate mightily on the existence of Israel, braying that "the awakening of nations and the expansion of freedom worldwide will no longer allow (Israelis) to continue their hypocrisy and vicious attitudes," further accusing the only reliably democratic state in the region offering human rights as "establishing a new form of slavery," its "racist ambitions" backed by Europe and the U. S.</p>
<p>No one can be sure of the final intentions of the Libyan Lone Ranger, who changes his mind often. But as of this writing Gadhafiis scheduled to soon touch down in St. John's for an overnight stop on his way back to Tripoli from a South America-Africa summit in Venezuela.</p>
<p>The federal government has announced it will dispatch Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon to dress down the Libyan leader. That's a move supported by the opposition Liberals, in the spirit that any opportunity to denounce a global pariah shouldn't be missed.</p>
<p>Whether or not the polite, soft-spoken Cannon will put the fear of the gods in a murderous loon such as Gadhafi is another matter. Perhaps the announcement is really just a public way of informing the Libyan that he's not welcome on our shores.</p>
<p>If there is a teachable moment in all this, it might just be that by providing an occasional forum for the criminals and madmen of the planet, the UN reminds us that our own leaders, not without their flaws, seem very balanced and benign by comparison, and that our beleaguered democracies still trump the alternatives.</p>
<p>That's not such a bad lesson when you think about it.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Catholic students can fly again; International travel ban in effect since 9/11 lifted</b>

</p>
<p>A ban on international travel has been lifted for Calgary Catholic high school students after trustees rescinded a policy that prohibited field trips to foreign countries.</p>
<p>Like many school boards across Canada, the Calgary Catholic School District stopped allowing international travel in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Chief superintendent Lucy Miller approved a handful of national and international trips over the past two years as a pilot during a review of the policy. District administration has now given the green light for local high schools who want to request foreign field trips.</p>
<p>"Students have lots of opportunities for great experiences without going international. However, when there are situations where an international experience would provide the best opportunity, then we want to have that available to students," said Miller.</p>
<p>All high school trips will still have to complete a risk assessment outlining safety requirements, explain the educational value of proposed travel and get the chief superintendent's approval.</p>
<p>The Calgary Board of Education temporarily banned international school trips in the wake of September 11, but over time lifted the travel restrictions. Last year, Calgary public schools made 20 international trips, to the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>All international trips must be approved by the principal, reviewed by the district's corporate risk management team and its off-site activities committee and get a green light from the area director before they are permitted, said CBE spokesman Ted Flitton.</p>
<p>"Requests are evaluated based first on safety and then on the educational tie of the trip to the curriculum," he said.</p>
<p>Bishop Carroll High School vice-principal Jacquie Langer was part of a trip to New York with about 130 music students last spring. During the five-day trip, students performed in an international music festival, took in a Broadway show, heard a New York Philharmonic rehearsal and saw a musical theatre audition.</p>
<p>"It was a huge educational experience. They saw amazing professionals in one of the most amazing settings in the world. They got to see people who have a career pathway in the arts," said Langer.</p>
<p>The Bishop Carroll trip almost didn't happen. Two days before they were set to leave, Alberta Education encouraged school boards to reconsider trips in the wake of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Calgary Catholic School District officials indicated the trip might be cancelled, but parents rallied to save it. At a parents' meeting the night before students were supposed to fly out, the district let parents decide if they wanted their child to travel.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu is a reminder of the importance of safety measures and effective communications when planning an international trip, said Langer.</p>
<p>"We all need to realize things may crop up on the journey of planning any trip, whether it is to Edmonton or New York," said Langer.</p>
<p>"It's a huge commitment. But the world is in some ways a smaller place and to have students have the opportunity to go out there is certainly worth experiencing."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Liberals would ban partisan advertising; Say government ads are aimed at boosting Tories</b>
</div><div>ANDREW MAYEDA   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>481 words</div><div>26 September 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>The federal Liberals said yesterday they would ban all taxpayer-funded "politicized" advertising if they come to power, arguing the Conservatives have broken government advertising rules with a campaign that promotes the federal budget.</p>
<p>Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said his party would follow the example of the Ontario government and appoint an independent oversight body to ensure all government advertising is free of political content.</p>
<p>The Liberals would also close what they perceive to be loopholes within federal communications guidelines so government ads couldn't feature an individual politician's name or image, for example.</p>
<p>The opposition Liberals object to what they see as the gratuitous use of Prime Minister Stephen Harper's name and image in publicly funded advertising and on government websites.</p>
<p>A website to promote the government's economic plan, plandaction. gc.ca, features several campaign-style photos of the prime minister and members of his cabinet. Official press releases now often refer to announcements made by the "Harper government," rather than the more neutral "government of Canada."</p>
<p>It was recently revealed the government spent about $39 million to market its economic plan through television spots and other media - more than five times the $6.5-million budget committed to raising awareness of the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>The TV ads tell viewers: "We have to stay on track" and "We can't stop now," taglines that dovetails with the Conservatives' message that an election would undermine the economic recovery.</p>
<p>Ignatieff called such tactics a "flagrant misuse of taxpayers' money."</p>
<p>"An incoming Liberal government wants to do politics differently," Ignatieff told reporters at a press conference yesterday. "We want to change the way we do this. We want to stop insulting the intelligence of Canadians. We want to stop abusing their money."</p>
<p>But a spokesman for the prime minister said the government has simply been informing the public of measures in Canada's economic-stimulus package, many of which are time limited, such as the home-renovation tax credit.</p>
<p>"The government has a responsibility to inform Canadians of what those measures are and how Canadians can take advantage of them," said spokesman Andrew MacDougall.</p>
<p>MacDougall also noted that, as a precondition to supporting the budget, the Liberals demanded the government show accountability by regularly updating Canadians on how the money in the stimulus package was being spent.</p>
<p>He said the amount spent on H1N1 ads would likely increase in November, when the government rolls out a vaccine against the virus.</p>
<p>In 2004, Ontario passed legislation put forward by the government of Premier Dalton McGuinty that required the provincial auditor-general to pre-screen government ads so they would not foster a positive impression of the governing party or a negative impression of any group that opposes the government's policies.</p>

<p>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -- You can learn a lot when you sit still for a few hours in a place where a good part of the world is passing by.</p>
<p>Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is one of the busiest hubs in Africa. The departures board, alternating between English and Aramaic, shows <span class="companylink">Ethiopian Airlines</span> flights leaving for four continents, with such destinations as Bombay, Khartoum, Nairobi, Beirut, Guangzhou, Stockholm, Rome, Washington and Amsterdam. There's even a place I've never heard of: Axum, via Gonder.</p>
<p>On the way home from a business trip to Rwanda, I had a four-hour stopover and spent much of it people-watching.</p>
<p>There are black nuns in grey habits, a small group of men swathed in flowing white robes the size of bedsheets, business travellers in ubiquitous grey suits. Two young men in jeans and T-shirts, holding passports from a central African country, take turns posing for photographs in front of the neon sign advertising one of the airport's duty free shops, as if to say "this picture shows I'm going somewhere."</p>
<p>The electronic monitor displaying departure times periodically switches to a warning about the H1N1 flu virus. Travellers are warned to cover their mouths when coughing or sneezing, to beware of such symptoms as fever, cough, sore throat or difficulty breathing and to wash their hands frequently.</p>
<p>Only a handful of passengers in the sprawling, modern airport lounge were wearing masks to guard against flu. Indeed, the flu-wary travellers in masks were greatly outnumbered by North American travellers carrying something else: Ethiopian children. In the course of a few hours, upwards of a dozen couples accompanied by one or sometimes two Ethiopian toddlers, make their way to flights bound for another continent - presumably examples of the international phenomenon that has made Ethiopia a popular destination for North Americans who want to adopt.</p>
<p>A couple behind me on a bench is so busy filling carry-on bags with diapers, sippy cups and plush toys that at one point, I wonder if they have lost track of their new baby, who is nowhere to be seen. But as the man turns to walk away, I see the baby strapped to his back in a carrier. The infant's little feet are dangling. Those little feet will hit the ground somewhere on the other side of the ocean. The parents board a flight for Washington.</p>
<p>A man rushing past, his head buried in his BlackBerry, is speaking in a British accent. The BlackBerry - Canada's latest gift to the world - is everywhere.</p>
<p>The airport terminal smells of smoke. This must be one of the last major airports in the world that allows passengers to smoke uninhibited - not in a sealed-off smoking zone, but everywhere. It feels, and smells, like the 1980s. Three Chinese men, each clutching a carton of Marlboros from the duty free, approach a tall black man who is smoking and signal that they need a light. They borrow his cigarette to light their own, then depart. It's a small world after all.</p>
<p>Finally, it is my turn to leave. At the departure lounge, I strip off my belt and shoes to run them through the scanner along with a basket of other belongings. When the basket carrying some of my belongings rolls out of the scanner, it is carrying a wallet bulging with cash - Swedish Kronor.</p>
<p>I pick up the wallet and look for the owner: there are two fellow passengers standing there.</p>
<p>I look first at a middle-aged white man. He shakes his head. A young black man who is wearing jeans, a sports shirt and warm jacket, smiles at me, takes the wallet and says thank you.</p>
<p>Just before boarding, I turn and the same man is behind me in line. He is clutching a photograph of a pretty young woman, dressed in a crisp white dress. He stares at the photo for nearly a minute, then quietly tucks it away. It seems to me he is leaving something behind and, like the baby with the dangling feet, may well be heading for a new life.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vitamin A supplements are cheap and effective</b>
</div><div>Joan Jory   </div>
<div>335 words</div><div>26 September 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>Recent reports have highlighted that First Nations peoples are a vulnerable sub group for the H1N1 virus. This appears particularly true on reserves where access to affordable food of sufficient nutritional quality to support immunity and health is limited.</p>
<p>Resistance to viruses, particularly cold and flu viruses, is dependent on a strong immune system. A strong immune system is regulated in the body by micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), especially vitamin A, zinc, iron and B12, the role of each of which has long been established in peer-reviewed research literature.</p>
<p>In recognition of this, Canada has been directly supporting delivery of micronutrients to vulnerable communities in drought or war-ravaged countries all over the world through something called the micronutrient initiative. Of particular note is Canada's recent landmark five billionth vitamin A capsule delivery. Vitamin A is perhaps nature's most potent anti-viral. According to the micronutrient initiative web page, it takes only two doses of vitamin A per year to help save a child's life.</p>
<p>Vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce respiratory infections by 25 per cent, even among Australian children with no laboratory indication of vitamin A deficiency. By extrapolation, vitamin A supplementation among First Nations peoples may reduce vulnerability to H1N1 by 25 per cent or more.</p>
<p>The estimated cost per capsule of vitamin A is approximately two cents, with proven reduction in infection incidence and none of the adverse reactions already reported in H1N1 vaccine trials.</p>
<p>Rather than body bags, would widespread vitamin A supplementation among our First Nations peoples not be a better priority in H1N1 preparedness?</p>
<p>Let's use a small portion of our international micronutrient initiative to support First Nations peoples and, for that matter, anyone in Canada living at or below the poverty line. Two cents per capsule is a minimal cost for an estimated 25 per cent potential reduction in infection incidence among our vulnerable peoples.</p>

<p>What would you do if swine flu kept half of your workforce at home?</p>
<p>This week, the employees of Export Development Canada did more than plan for every company's worst nightmare -- they lived it.</p>
<p>In a simulated exercise designed to test the EDC's pandemic plan, about 50 per cent of the Crown corporation's employees stayed home on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The exercise began when each employee received a randomly selected card.</p>
<p>An e-mail sent the next day explained what the cards meant: those with black and yellow cards went to work, green and blue cardholders stayed home to care for family, purple cardholders were quarantined but could work remotely, and so on.</p>
<p>"We wanted to get at the little things, the breakdowns in communication between departments and so on," said Phil Taylor, spokesperson for the EDC, which handles $250 million in business each day and provides financing and insurance to Canadian firms.</p>
<p>What did they learn?</p>
<p>"We closed all the transactions we needed to, but there's always more room for cross-training (of staff)," he said. The company runs various scenarios on a regular basis to test how they would manage if, for example, the building were bombed, Taylor said.</p>
<p>"This one we did in a bigger way because it's coming."</p>

<p>The boxes of hand sanitizer were the first thing to arrive at Sun Life Financial's downtown office.</p>
<p>The disinfecting wipes and sterile masks came next, complete with distribution instructions from company headquarters.</p>
<p>Soon, Elizabeth Wade, an administrator at Sun Life, was sitting through departmental meetings on how the firm would cope if large numbers of her colleagues were struck down by swine flu.</p>
<p>Overnight it seemed, "pandemic planning" had forced a subtle but unmistakable change in the daily grind at the King Street West office.</p>
<p>"It was a little daunting at first, you know hearing words like 'pandemic'," said Wade. "But now it's just second nature to everybody."</p>
<p>Though many large firms like Sun Life have developed plans to deal with a potential pandemic this fall, most small to medium-sized companies haven't even contemplated a scenario that could see huge swaths of their workforce absent.</p>
<p>A recent survey by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce found that although 57 per cent of companies believe the threat of a swine flu pandemic is real, less than half had come up with a plan to deal with one.</p>
<p>Many employers remain doubtful about how big a problem swine flu will present in the workplace. Of the 350 businesses surveyed by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce during the first two weeks of September, 21 per cent said they believed the threat of swine flu is minimal and has been blown out of proportion.</p>
<p>Those figures are troubling, given the effect a true pandemic could have on the economy, said Amin Mawani, director of the health industry management program at York University's Schulich School of Business.</p>
<p>The costs associated with lost productivity due to swine flu could surpass even the $2-billion bite that SARS took out of the economy, he says.</p>
<p>"As we saw in Mexico, this is a bug that can shut businesses down," he said.</p>
<p>A severe pandemic can make 35 per cent of the population ill and keep scores of additional people at home caring for sick family members.</p>
<p>Should a severe pandemic develop, companies should be ready with a contingency plan for how to keep operations running when up to 50 per cent of the workforce is absent, the Public Health Agency of Canada suggests.</p>
<p>Though local health officials doubt the swine flu will cause a crisis of that degree, the effects on business could still be serious, they say.</p>
<p>"I really would not expect 50 per cent absenteeism but on any given day, the numbers could approach 10 to 15 per cent," said Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton's medical officer of health. "You have to be prepared for absenteeism, especially in critical areas."</p>
<p>Companies should establish a business continuity committee, prioritize vital operations and cross-train employees so that important skills aren't tied to a single person, said Amy Terrill, vice-president of communications for the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. Employers should also examine how emergency plans fit with existing labour agreements and think about how staff could work remotely, she says.</p>
<p>Sun Life Financial now posts flu advisories on its intranet site and has set up a hotline for its offices to report absences due to swine flu.</p>
<p>"We argue that there's no excuse for any business not to have a plan in place," she said. "We call it a pandemic plan but it's really a business continuity plan for any kind of emergency."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, smaller firms are rarely well prepared, she says.</p>
<p>"If a small company has to shut down for a day, often the thinking is 'it isn't the end of the world,'" said Terrill, who recommends every business have a plan in place. "But with a full-blown pandemic, you could be dealing with the effects for months."</p>
<p>Walter Koppelaar, who employs about 130 people at his Hamilton structural steel firm, says the biggest obstacle for most companies is finding the time to plan. Though he is somewhat concerned about swine flu, his hands are full managing his business through a tough economy.</p>
<p>"Particularly in a small to medium-sized company, there's only so many things you can contemplate in a day," he said.</p>
<p>Rob Hattin, owner of Hamilton's Edson Packaging Machinery, began taking steps to prevent the spread of swine flu last year.</p>
<p>He invested in hand sanitizers and posted a sign outside the office urging those with flu symptoms to delay their visits or call another time. To put his customers at ease, he also encouraged his employees to let customers know that they were in good health before making sales calls. Edson salespeople will even provide signed statements to reassure customers, he says.</p>
<p>"Most companies are adaptable," he said. "We've had disruptions before. This is just the latest hassle."</p>

<p>Italian soccer officials are considering large-scale vaccinations to protect players from swine flu.</p>
<p>Italy coach Marcello Lippi told the ANSA news agency Friday that "the possibility of vaccinating all the players on every team is being considered."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Italy announced its first swine flu victim was a 51-year-old man with chronic heart problems who died in a Naples hospital.</p>
<p>Italy expects swine flu to peak between December and January with between 1.5 and three million cases. A vaccination campaign beginning Nov. 15 will immunize up to 40 per cent of Italy's 60 million people. The first wave of vaccinations will target nine million, including health workers. A second wave will begin in February.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>An independent watchdog is needed to stop the Conservatives' "flagrant misuse of taxpayers' money" on partisan government advertising, Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said yesterday.</p>
<p>The Liberals are proposing a system similar to one adopted in Ontario in 2004, which screens provincial government ads for partisanship and bans the use of any politician's name, image or voice.</p>
<p>The committee would "make absolutely sure that the government of Canada advertises for the government of Canada -- not for the party in power," Ignatieff said.</p>
<p>The proposal comes in reaction to news the Tories are spending four times as much promoting their January budget than they are on public service messages for swine flu.</p>

<p>TORONTO -- Contrary to online posts attributed to Marilyn Manson himself, the shock-rocker's reps are saying that he does not, in fact, have swine flu, or H1N1.</p>
<p>The Gillett Entertainment Group and <span class="companylink">Live Nation</span> sent out a release on Friday denying that Manson had contracted the illness and confirming that he would play his two remaining Canadian tour dates.</p>
<p>Manson was to play in Halifax on Friday and Moncton, N.B., on Saturday.</p>
<p>The release contradicts posts on Manson's MySpace and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> pages that were attributed to the artist. The posts have since been removed.</p>
<p>"So I have officially been diagnosed, by a real doctor, with THE SWINE FLU," Manson had written. "Unfortunately, I am going to survive."</p>
<p>Manson is touring in support of his new album, "The High End of Low," released in May.</p>

<p>A passion for science combined with a desire to work with people equals the perfect prescription for a successful career as a pharmacist.</p>
<p>It's a profession in high demand in B.C. as well in the rest of the world, and with pharmacists taking on additional roles to provide health-care services in the province, it's becoming an even more interesting career option.</p>
<p>Beginning this fall, B.C. pharmacists will be able to administer injections to patients -- including the H1N1 flu vaccine, which will reduce the pressure on doctors' offices and make it more convenient for people to protect themselves from the virus.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the province also gave pharmacists the authority to renew and alter prescriptions without first sending patients to their doctor's office.</p>
<p>"It's a really exciting and evolving career," says Marshall Moleschi, registrar of the B.C. College of Pharmacists. "Pharmacists are the medication experts in the health profession and there is a huge need for them.</p>
<p>"For people interested in the sciences, it's a profession where you can apply your knowledge and really interact with patients -- they are the most accessible health professionals."</p>
<p>Pharmacists are trained to ensure patients receive the most appropriate medications, and to see that prescriptions don't cause problems because of drug interactions.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a career in pharmacy meant working behind a raised counter in a neighbourhood drug store. Pharmacists may still decide to work in a drug store but many more are joining health-care teams at long-term care facilities, specialized clinics and hospitals.</p>
<p>And even in the local drug store, they are liaising with local clinics and increasing their services to patients at the counter.</p>
<p>"There are lots of opportunities," Moleschi says. "Pharmacists are getting more involved in direct patient care, in HIV clinics, diabetes programs, geriatrics."</p>
<p>B.C. has a continuing shortage of trained pharmacists, especially in communities outside Metro Vancouver, which will likely continue as the population ages.</p>
<p>Becoming a pharmacist takes five years at university to meet minimum requirements. Students interested in a specialty or hospital work pursue more training or complete a doctoral degree. Salaries for pharmacists start in the $50,000-to-$60,000 range, rising to $100,000 for those with advanced degrees.</p>
<p>Competition is fierce for a place in a university program in Canada, but a new facility at the University of B.C. will expand the number of spaces for students studying pharmaceutical science.</p>
<p>An additional 72 spaces, beginning in the fall of 2011, will also reduce the province's dependence on other provinces, and countries, to meet the demand for pharmacists here.</p>
<p>"We're trying to meet the needs for pharmacists in B.C. -- we can't do it at this point, but this is a big, bold step," says Dr. Robert Sindelar, dean of UBC's program.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Loewen, a professor with the UBC program and regional co-ordinator of pharmacy services for Vancouver area hospitals, says people who choose a career in pharmacy typically want to work in science but don't want to be confined to a laboratory.</p>
<p>"They want to be involved in health care, to interact directly with patients," Loewen says. "They want to improve people's health and well-being and develop relationships, but they're also looking for a science-based profession."</p>
<p>Shakeel Bhatti is a science-minded individual who also wanted to work with people and chose pharmacy to meet both needs.</p>
<p>"I've always been a social scientist," says Bhatti, who owns Murrayville Family Pharmacy in Langley, B.C. "I like people and I like science -- I think most pharmacists are like that."</p>
<p>Bhatti has been in the business for 23 years and has worked in community and hospital pharmacies.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, he jumped at an opportunity to own his own pharmacy and has now expanded to three locations in Langley.</p>
<p>While he enjoys the complexity of managing his patients' prescriptions, it's the relationships that make his work most satisfying.</p>
<p>"With every prescription, I have to talk to my patients, spend time with them, get to know who they are -- people often stay with their pharmacist for a lifetime," Bhatti says. "We have to know our patients just like the doctors so we can advise them about their medications."</p>

<p>Global production of the H1N1 vaccine is expected to reach about three billion doses, enough for just under half the world's population, the World Health Organization said yesterday.</p>
<p>The agency was hoping pharmaceutical companies would be able to make about five billion doses a year, but data collected over the summer led to the revised estimate.</p>
<p>Despite the lower figure, WHO said it is good news that clinical trials are so far showing one dose of the vaccine is sufficient to provide immunity against the virus in most populations.</p>
<p>Children and some other population groups might need two doses, but generally, a single dose is expected to be enough. That means twice as many people can be protected with the supplies that are in the process of being manufactured around the world.</p>
<p>"These supplies will still be inadequate to cover a world population of 6.8 billion people in which virtually everyone is susceptible to infection by a new and readily contagious virus," the health organization said in a statement.</p>
<p>It is encouraging countries to donate part of their vaccine orders to developing countries and so far has commitments from the United States, Australia, Brazil, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>"We are discussing with Canada," Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, director of the Initiative for Vaccine Research at the WHO, said in a teleconference with reporters.</p>
<p>She also said WHO is aware of a preliminary study out of Canada that indicates getting the seasonal flu shot might put people at risk of contracting the H1N1 virus. The data has not been validated and Kieny said WHO is talking to experts around the world who are investigating their own data sets to see if there are any similarities.</p>
<p>"None of the other countries have been able to find anything like that," said Kieny. Seasonal flu vaccines have been used for years and such results have never surfaced.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada said it is aware of the Canadian data suggesting a potential link between the seasonal flu shot and the H1N1 virus, but said no result can be considered conclusive until a peer-review process is completed.</p>
<p>"We are also aware of studies done in several other countries that have not found the same association," an agency spokesperson said in an</p>
<p>e-mail. "At this point, we are unable to comment on why the studies are finding different results."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Nothing ad hog about swine flu event</b>
</div><div>Allan Woods </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The swine flu outbreak was peaking, people were dying and the Canadian pork industry was in crisis.</p>
<p>After a herd of Alberta pigs was infected with the H1N1 flu virus last April, countries began closing their borders to Canadian hogs, threatening $3 billion in exports and 40,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Ottawa's response was to hold a barbecue on Parliament Hill with pulled pork on the menu, and hog farmers, foreign diplomats and lots of television cameras in the crowd.</p>
<p>But it was carefully crafted to ensure two Conservative ministers, Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz and Minister of State for Agriculture Jean-Pierre Blackburn, were the stars of the show, according to 841 pages of internal emails obtained by the Toronto Star.</p>
<p>The emails provide more examples of how the federal Tories are trying to capitalize on national crises. Earlier this week, reports indicated the government was spending five times as much money to promote its economic recovery plan as on ads urging people to prepare for a fall outbreak of swine flu.</p>
<p>The emails also reveal the top-down control that the government exerts on the smallest public appearance to promote its messages, by ensuring flattering images reach target audiences.</p>
<p>The one-hour lunch on May 6 was thrown together in two days in an operation driven by partisanship, pettiness and insecurity - not just concern for the pork industry.</p>
<p>Federal bureaucrats plotted to ensure Tory-blue banners and logos received better placement than those of the Canadian Pork Council.</p>
<p>"Make sure that they understand this is OUR event and they can't stick their banner behind the minister where our backdrop may need to be," wrote Cathy Gauthier, an executive services manager with Agriculture Canada.</p>
<p>Another email, from Ritz's press secretary, advised planners to strive for a "real setting" so Ritz would look relaxed and informal.</p>
<p>"Nothing 'staged' looking," Meagan Murdoch wrote as she cancelled plans for a podium and prepared speech.</p>
<p>The lunch was painstakingly staged, right down to which aprons cabinet ministers would wear to ensure maximum political benefit to the Tory government - this despite politicians of all stripes and dietary persuasions showing up to support Canadian pork producers.</p>
<p>"I believe it's important to have a visual where the ministers 'eat' pork. Not only flipping it on a barbeque," suggested Sylvain Frenette, Blackburn's political director. "So we have to ensure that what they will eat is visually appealing ... . It has to be easy to eat. Small pieces already cut up and ready to eat. So that he's not fighting with a piece of meat. So that he doesn't get dirty, etc."</p>
<p>Ritz's staff had their own ideas about the best light in which to present him.</p>
<p>"Please ensure that the minister has a spot in the serving line (complete with apron would be best) - this is the money shot," Murdoch wrote.</p>
<p>But the photographs didn't go exactly as planned.</p>
<p>One with Ritz serving a pork sandwich to Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff was intentionally excluded from the Agriculture Canada website. As Murdoch rushed to post the pictures online after the event, she ordered a single photo of her boss to be featured prominently.</p>
<p>"All others (not the one with opp leader) should go into the online photo album," she wrote.</p>
<p>The government calls such things "message events," and each one must be okayed at the highest levels of the federal bureaucracy by officials in the Privy Council Office.</p>
<p>The "message event proposal" for the pork lunch indicates the headline the government would like to achieve in the media: "Government of Canada Dishes Out Support For Canadian Pork."</p>
<p>It also spelled out the desired 25-second soundbite ("Canadian pork is safe"), an ideal photograph (Ritz and Blackburn serving pork to a hungry crowd), and the ministers' attire (business casual with aprons).</p>
<p>The lunch was arranged after authorities confirmed in May that a herd of pigs were infected with swine flu on an Alberta farm.</p>
<p>"That weekend was absolutely painful on the members of our industry," said Gary Stordy, a spokesman with the Canadian Pork Council. "We expected a full border shutdown ... . There was a significant amount of stress."</p>

<div>DIPLOMATIC PROTEST / LIBYAN LEADER'S CANADIAN STOPOVER</div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Fresh from walking out on the Iranian President at the United Nations, Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon is being dispatched to Newfoundland next week to express Canada's displeasure to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.</p>
<p>On an overnight refuelling stop in St. John's, Colonel Gadhafi can expect to be scolded for the warm welcome Libyans gave to the Lockerbie bomber last month after his release from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds.</p>
<p>The 1988 terror attack killed 270 people, including four Canadians.</p>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Minister will “voice Canada's strong disapproval over the hero's welcome organized for Abdel Baset al-Megrahi, the man responsible for the Lockerbie terrorist bombing,” Harper spokesman Dimitri Soudas said.</p>
<p>Libya organized a huge celebration at the airport in Tripoli for Mr. al-Megrahi, who has terminal cancer. “It constituted an insult to all victims who died, including Canadians,” Mr. Soudas said.</p>
<p>Col. Gadhafi will stay in St. John's overnight, but both the Prime Minister's Office and Department of Foreign Affairs refused to say where, for how long, or on what date.</p>
<p>The PMO stressed that Col. Gadhafi's stopover was not an official visit. The enigmatic Libyan dictator is in the United States this week and will then to travel to Venezuela for the South America-Africa Summit, which runs tomorrow and Sunday. Col. Gadhafi will stop in St. John's on his way back to Libya from the summit.</p>
<p>“It's common practice for planes to refuel and undergo short stopovers in Newfoundland,” Mr. Soudas said. A St. John's airport official echoed the sentiment.</p>
<p>The dressing down by Mr. Cannon will be the second diplomatic protest launched by the Harper government this month. On Wednesday, Mr. Cannon led the Canadian delegation off the floor of the United Nations General Assembly as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took the podium. Other delegations followed.</p>
<p>Libya and Canada maintain diplomatic ties that would make it difficult to refuse a stopover.</p>
<p>“But on this specific [Lockerbie] issue, that's why Minister Cannon has been asked by the Prime Minister to go meet the Libyan leader,” Mr. Soudas said. “My understanding is it's refuelling overnight and then depart the next day.”</p>
<p>Liberal foreign affairs critic Bob Rae said he supports the Conservative government's decision to dispatch Mr. Cannon to speak to Col. Gadhafi.</p>
<p>“I do think that it would be wrong of Canada not to take every opportunity to express its concerns,” Mr. Rae said. “I am glad that Mr. Cannon is taking that opportunity to express those thoughts. Whether that will have any impact on Mr. Gadhafi's plans, I don't know.”</p>
<p>NDP foreign affairs critic Paul Dewar said that to go to Newfoundland to simply lecture the Libyan leader is a waste of time. “Everyone can criticize Gadhafi … I hope he goes beyond that one issue,” Mr. Dewar said.</p>
<p>After abandoning its weapons of mass destruction program six years ago and resuming diplomatic relations with the United States only three years ago, Libya had been on a path to rebuild ties with the West. But Col. Gadhafi's North American visit was met with hostility.</p>
<p>He was unwelcome in at least one hotel and he struggled to find a place to pitch a Bedouin tent, which was eventually erected on a Donald Trump estate. It's not clear if he plans to bring a tent to St. John's.</p>
<p>The Libyan leader's speech at the United Nations was greeted with similar confusion.</p>
<p>In a lengthy and rambling address that went six times longer than its allotted time, he compared the Security Council to al-Qaeda, called for compensation for colonialism and wondered whether swine flu was created in a military lab.</p>
<p>He also demanded trials for former U.S. president George W. Bush and former British prime minister Tony Blair, and tore up a copy of the UN Charter in front of startled delegates.</p>
<p>With reports from Oliver Moore in Halifax, Steven Chase in Ottawa, and Josh Wingrove in Toronto</p>

<p>Global production of the H1N1 vaccine is expected to reach only about 3 billion doses, enough for just under half the world's population, the World Health Organization said yesterday.</p>

<p>"At this point, we are unable to comment on why the studies are finding different results, but an arms-length review of the various methods is currently under way to assess that."</p>
<p>Donald Low, chief microbiologist at Toronto's Mount Sinai hospital, said the unpublished study found people who had been vaccinated against the seasonal flu were two times more likely to get H1N1 than those who weren't vaccinated.</p>
<p>"This is very preliminary data that still needs to be validated," Low said.</p>
<p>Canada has ordered 50.4 million doses of the pandemic vaccine from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>. With results showing one dose will likely be needed for those who choose to get the vaccine, Canada could potentially have thousands of extra doses that could be donated to developing countries.</p>

<p>Quebec Health authorities have cancelled a series of breastfeeding gatherings across the province fearing the H1N1 virus could pose too much of a health risk to mothers and babies.</p>
<p>The Breastfeeding Challenge is held each year in October in some 20 cities across the province with the goal of having the greatest number of babies breastfeed at the same time around the world.</p>
<p>The activity attracts some 2,500 women and their babies in Montreal and 500 in Quebec City.</p>
<p>Authorities said they don't know how the pandemic will evolve and would rather err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>"Statistics gathered during the first pandemic wave show pregnant women, women who just gave birth, newborns and young children are more vulnerable to the virus and risk developing major complications," the health agency said in a news release.</p>
<p>Moreover, the agency said babies and toddlers can't follow the basic hygiene guidelines such as washing hands regularly.</p>
<p>The Quebec government will announce Friday if it is cancelling or delaying the seasonal flu vaccination campaign in favour of a mass inoculation against the H1N1 strain.</p>

</p>
<p>'It's people like you," I told my wife, "who are behind this pandemic."</p>
<p>"I don't have swine flu," she sniffed. "I have a cold.</p>
<p>"Besides, I have to do a presentation today. I can't stay home."</p>
<p>With that, she headed off, infected not only with some unidentified plague but also the work ethic that turns the most committed of employees into the Typhoid Marys of the office during flu season.</p>
<p>Studies of absenteeism have long shown that the decision of whether or not to go to work is based as much on how people feel about their jobs as it is on their symptoms. People in managerial positions take far fewer sick days than employees who feel they have less control over their working conditions. Dysfunctional workplaces can be identified by higher rates of absenteeism.</p>
<p>One of the themes of our working culture is that people who are sick a lot are slackers who are more likely to fall prey to the Monday flu.</p>
<p>But the flip side of that is what has been called "presenteeism," the irrepressible urge some people have to show up to work no matter how sick they may be.</p>
<p>Presenteeism may be driven by guilt, by subtle pressure not to let down co-workers, by sheer enthusiasm for the work or fear of a loss of wages for people who don't get paid sick leave.</p>
<p>A survey of American workers by the U.S. based National Foundation for Infectious Diseases a couple of years ago found that about a third of employees felt pressured to go to work despite being sick.</p>
<p>None of this bodes well for containing the spread of the H1N1 flu, which is now well-established in British Columbia.</p>
<p>It may be that slackers and hypochondriacs are the heroes in the battle against this global pandemic.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall, B.C.'s provincial health officer, says employers who don't encourage their workers to stay home when they are sick are being short-sighted.</p>
<p>"If they encourage them to come to work or make them feel like they should come to work, all they are going to end up with is a lot more illness in their workplace and the potential for even greater absenteeism and disruption."</p>
<p>The service industry may be faced with the biggest challenge, Kendall says, since workers usually can't work from home and often don't get sick leave.</p>
<p>As it turned out, my wife did have a cold, (dang, right again) which, health officials say, doesn't have to be a red light for people who can control the symptoms. Just don't expect your co-workers to be all that thrilled to see you.</p>
<p>But how do you know that the malaise you are feeling as you slide your feet out of bed in the morning is a cold or some lesser ailment and not the beginning of a bout of the dreaded H1N1?</p>
<p>Kendall says that won't be a question for most people who get hit with H1N1, since influenza comes on rapidly and leaves you "basically feeling like you've been hit with a truck."</p>
<p>The symptoms are fever, a dry cough, muscular aches and pains and no energy.</p>
<p>Still, in the early going, the keeners, or people who can't afford to lose a day's wages, may feel inclined to head off to work.</p>
<p>That puts the rest of us at risk. Kendall says the flu can be contagious for up to 24 hours before the onset of symptoms and for seven to as long as 10 days afterward.</p>
<p>"We're not trying to encourage absenteeism, but we're trying to discourage presenteeism from people who clearly shouldn't be at work."</p>

</p>
<p>The B.C. Medical Association wants its member physicians to be paid a fee by the provincial government for phone consultations involving potential H1N1 influenza cases.</p>
<p>BCMA president Dr. Brian Brodie said Thursday it would be financially and medically smarter to keep possible H1N1 patients at home rather than having them come to clogged physician offices, where other patients could be infected with the virus.</p>
<p>The phone consultation fee, recently proposed by the BCMA in discussions with the ministry of health, is $14.74, half the current office-visit fee.</p>
<p>Besides being cheaper than office visits, said Brodie, phone consultations would help physicians diagnose and prescribe treatment within the critical 48-hour period after the appearance of symptoms.</p>
<p>The BCMA president said, "this is really about good economy and timeliness."</p>
<p>At present, physicians are not paid for phone consultations. The fee would provide a "little bit of a financial incentive" for busy physicians to speak with patients who fear they have swine flu symptoms, said Brodie.</p>
<p>The BCMA is also seeking a second adjustment to the physician-fee structure so doctors are not penalized financially during a H1N1 influenza outbreak.</p>
<p>Now, physicians are paid $29.48 for every office visit. That rate is cut in half once a physician has seen 50 patients in a day.</p>
<p>The BCMA is proposing H1N1 patients not be included in that 50-patient cap because physicians' offices could be full of influenza patients in the event of a flu outbreak, driving the daily patient total well beyond 50.</p>
<p>Brodie said it would be unfair to ask physicians to increase their patient load during a flu outbreak but continue to apply a cap designed to restrict patient numbers.</p>
<p>The ministries of health services and healthy living and sport, in a media statement, confirmed they have been meeting with the BCMA to discuss possible changes of the fee structure during an H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>"We know doctors may be unable to perform many of their usual duties in a severe pandemic.</p>
<p>"We will make sure doctors in British Columbia will be fairly paid for their services connected to the H1N1 influenza virus."</p>
<p>The ministries added that any British Columbian who needs or wants the H1N1 vaccine or antiviral medication for a serious influenza infection will be able to get it.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization, meanwhile, is encouraging richer countries to donate part of their vaccine orders to developing countries and so far has commitments from the United States, Australia, Brazil, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>"We are discussing with Canada," said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, director of the Initiative for Vaccine Research at WHO.</p>
<p>She also said WHO is aware of a preliminary study out of Canada that indicates getting the seasonal flu shot may put people at risk of contracting the H1N1 virus. The data has not yet been validated and Kieny said WHO is talking to experts around the world who are investigating their own data sets to see if there are any similarities.</p>
<p>The work, led by Dr. Danuta Skowronski of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control and Dr. Gaston De Serres of Laval University, is now in the hands of a scientific journal. "None of the other countries have been able to find anything like that," said Kieny.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada said it is aware of the Canadian data suggesting a potential link between the seasonal flu shot and the H1N1 virus, but said no result can be considered conclusive until a peer review process is completed.</p>

<p>Ontario will roll out its seasonal and H1N1 flu vaccination campaigns in three stages, the province's chief medical officer of health said Thursday. Ontarians over the age of 65 and residents of long-term care homes will be offered the seasonal flu vaccine in October, followed by an H1N1 flu vaccination program for all Ontarians in November. Dr. Arlene King said all Ontario residents will be offered the regular seasonal flu shot in December and January following the H1N1 flu vaccination program.</p>

</p>
<p>This excerpt is from an editorial in the Summerside Journal-Pioneer on Thursday.</p>
<p>What's more annoying than seeing your favourite television show interrupted by repetitive ads talking about how wonderfully the federal government's stimulus program is working? The fact that we all helped pay for those ads, which are in print, on radio and on the Internet, too.</p>
<p>Yes, there are our tax dollars hard at work - promoting the Conservative government's performance.</p>
<p>The ads are very polished, portraying Canada's Economic Action Plan in progress across the country. According to a Canadian Press story, this latest television ad promotion cost $5 million. There's been $34 million budgeted for promotion of the action plan.</p>
<p>If the blatant Conservative party campaigning isn't bad enough, there's a line from an elderly man in one of the ads suggesting, "But we have to stay on track." That's the clincher. Does this just sound like encouragement to keep the current government in place or what?</p>
<p>Does it not seem odd that they are spending our money to tell us they're spending our money? But even more infuriating is this plug for Stephen Harper's government . . . .</p>
<p>There are places for tax dollar-funded advertising, like promoting new programs such as the home renovation tax credit to let Canadians know about incentives available to them, or encouraging Canadians to practise ways of preventing the spread of H1N1. But this partisan approach to promotion has to stop.</p>
<p>If the Conservative government wants to tell us about the great work they are doing and to encourage Canadians to continue to keep them in office, then use the party's funds, not tax dollars.</p>

<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Local university and college students who catch the flu won't have to get a doctor's note this fall to be excused from writing tests, attending labs or submitting assignments on time.</p>
<p>That's because concerns are so high about spreading the flu virus that no one wants a sick student going to the doctor's office, spreading the disease on the way, for the sole purpose of getting a note.</p>
<p>Professors at Wilfrid Laurier University, where one student has already been identified with the H1N1 virus and has recovered, were told this week that students with the flu should only visit student health services if they actually need medical attention.</p>
<p>"Otherwise, they should remain isolated in their rooms," says the directive from Waterloo Region's public health department, which was passed to faculty.</p>
<p>"They should not attend classes or exams until their symptoms have cleared up and they are well enough to participate in normal activities."</p>
<p>Officials at University of Waterloo and Conestoga College said they are also following this directive from public health.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus, which has reached pandemic proportions, is expected to hit hardest on young people, up to their mid-20s.</p>
<p>As for the issue of how to contain the spread of flu in dormitories, students who get a fever are asked to go to health services, and then, if necessary, "we would request they go home to recover," said Mike Belanger, WLU's director of residential services.</p>
<p>There are nearly 3,700 students in residence at Laurier's Waterloo and Brantford campuses, he said. About 90 per cent of Laurier students are from Toronto and surrounding area.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health has said that in residences, the following suggestions should be considered:</p>
<p>Students with flu symptoms should get a single room.</p>
<p>If that's not possible, rooms should be arranged so that two students with flu symptoms share a room. The beds should be arranged so that they are lying head-to-toe.</p>
<p>"Temporary barriers" made of sheets or curtains should be constructed between the beds.</p>
<p>In communal bathrooms, some sinks and toilets should be used only by the ill students.</p>
<p>Provisions should be made for sick students to receive food, water and medication while in their rooms</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Plans are in place to begin offering local H1N1 immunization clinics by early November, Wellington County councillors heard yesterday, though the timeline depends entirely on officials getting their hands on the vaccine.</p>
<p>"In terms of when it will arrive, I don't have that information," Tracey Croft, emergency manager for Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health, told councillors.</p>
<p>Croft said public health and its municipal partners have been crafting a pandemic response plan based largely on the assumption there would not be adequate vaccine for everyone who wants it, and have been focusing instead on how to prevent spread.</p>
<p>Linda Dickson, the county's community emergency management co-ordinator, said senior staff members have been meeting since May to discuss strategies for managing a pandemic, and a few weeks ago department heads met to discuss how to reduce the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Councillors heard for several years county officials have been part of a pandemic working group.</p>
<p>In the event of a pandemic outbreak, a control group is in place, which would be headed by the medical officer of health and include leaders from each of the health unit's municipal partners to ensure a coordinated response.</p>
<p>Croft said public health began "intense planning" in July to prepare for an H1N1 outbreak, and is now in "preparedness mode" getting clinics ready.</p>
<p>She conceded we might not see a widespread pandemic, "but because we don't know, it's better to be vigilant.</p>
<p>"Regardless of the impact of this virus, this flu season will be different," Croft said.</p>
<p>She noted the community pandemic plan is not specific to H1N1.</p>
<p>Coun. Carl Hall expressed concern about media reports yesterday morning suggesting those who got a seasonal flu vaccine last year might be more likely to contract H1N1.</p>
<p>Croft could not comment on that, but conceded any large immunization program "brings with it concerns and questions."</p>
<p>Coun. Lou Maieron asked whether public health has looked at prioritizing who will receive the vaccine once it is available, suggesting for example an in-school immunization program since children are considered to be an at-risk population.</p>
<p>Croft said the health agency considered this, but decided against it as community clinics are considered more effective and parents often want to be present when their children receive immunizations.</p>
<p>"With the timeline and resources we have available, that may not be the most efficient model," Croft said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health minister still stumped over body bags sent to reserves</b>
</div><div>Chinta Puxley   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>

</p>
<p>WINNIPEG</p>
<p>It's been over a week but Canada's health minister said she still doesn't know why dozens of body bags were sent to some Manitoba reserves in preparation for flu season.</p>
<p>Leona Aglukkaq met with aboriginal leaders in Winnipeg on Thursday to repair some of the damage done by the shipment of body bags which aboriginal leaders called insulting and horrifying.</p>
<p>Chiefs had called for a personal apology from Aglukkaq, as well as the resignation of senior bureaucrats responsible.</p>
<p>While Aglukkaq vowed to get to the bottom of the matter a week ago, she didn't offer an apology Thursday or an explanation.</p>
<p>"It is deeply regrettable," she said following a meeting with Grand Chief Ron Evans of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs.</p>
<p>"I need to evaluate what happened, whether this is an isolated case or whether it's a case that happened across the country. It's important for me to ensure that I have all the facts."</p>
<p>Health Canada shipped dozens of body bags to remote reserves in northeastern Manitoba last week, along with hand sanitizer and other medical supplies. The reserves that received the shipments were those that were hardest hit by H1N1 flu in the spring.</p>
<p>Many interpreted the delivery of the body bags as a grim prediction from Ottawa that many in those same communities would not survive the second wave of H1N1.</p>
<p>Although Health Canada bureaucrats say the body bags were simply part of a normal restocking process and not connected to H1N1 flu, Aglukkaq said her staff is still investigating.</p>
<p>When the investigation is complete, she said the report will be shared with aboriginal leaders.</p>
<p>That explanation seemed to satisfy some chiefs who had been furious the week before. Grand Chief David Harper, who represents northern First Nation communities, said he's prepared to wait for a full investigation.</p>
<p>"It's still under inquiry so we'll be getting some information as soon as the inquiry is done," he said following a late afternoon meeting with Aglukkaq. "We're pretty satisfied with that."</p>
<p>The national scrutiny and political pressure brought on by the shipment of body bags seems to have had a positive effect, Harper said.</p>
<p>Health Canada is finally taking their concerns seriously and is helping communities prepare for the second coming of H1N1 flu, he added.</p>
<p>Last weekend, the government outlined a plan for regular meetings between the Assembly of First Nations and government staff.</p>
<p>Some Manitoba chiefs are meeting again with Aglukkaq and other ministers next week in Ottawa to talk more about flu preparedness.</p>
<p>"Things are moving forward," Harper said. "There is another wave that's on its way. It's possibly here now so we have to deal with this issue as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Evans said they will wait patiently for the report into why body bags were sent to some reserves. In the meantime, he said communication between First Nations and Health Canada has improved.</p>
<p>"I feel we are being listened to now," he said. "We've come a long way. . . . It's a matter of now ensuring that the things we talk about at the table are indeed followed through."</p>

<p>Caller: Where can I register my child for swimming lessons in the Danforth-Pape area?</p>
<p>Operator: Says that information is in the city's Fun Guide, available online or at civic centres, but offers to look it up.</p>
<p>Caller: I don't know where the nearest pool is.</p>
<p>Operator: Responds that it's the Matty Eckler Centre, just east of Danforth, north of Dundas. The Jimmie Simpson pool is closer but closed for construction, she says. She suggests two other possibilities, East York and Frankland community centres. She adds that registration information is available online and offers to transfer the call.</p>
<p>Caller: How can I get to Don Mills Centre from Danforth and Pape?</p>
<p>Operator: Is that a community centre?</p>
<p>Informed it's a shopping mall, the operator looks up the location online and says the caller will have to check with the TTC about how to get there on transit. Gives the correct number for the TTC.</p>
<p>Time elapsed: Less than four minutes.</p>
<p>Comment: The closest pool is actually at Frankland. The Matty Eckler Centre is near Pape and Gerrard, not Danforth and Dundas, which are parallel.</p>
<p>CALLER: I live on Broadway Ave. near Hanna Rd. That's near Bayview and Eglinton Aves. Can you tell me where the nearest library is?</p>
<p>Operator: Says she'll have to look it up, puts caller on hold (listening to CHFI) for four minutes. Says she's found a library at 40 Orchard View Blvd. "near Mount Pleasant Rd. and Eglinton." Then corrects herself: "It's just north of Yonge and Eglinton at 40 Orchard View." Gives correct phone number. Then offers another branch, "on Mount Pleasant Rd. just north of Davisville." Gives correct address and number.</p>
<p>Offers a third choice: "Also a little bit east of you there is another library called Leaside Branch. That's in a little subdivision east of you. That might be hard to find." (The library is in Trace Manes Park.)</p>
<p>She says it's just off Millwood Rd., and gives correct address and phone.</p>
<p>Time elapsed: Eight minutes 46 seconds.</p>
<p>Comment: Library information is accurate.</p>
<p>CALLER: Hello, I live at ... and I have two questions. I want to know when my next yard waste pick-up will be, and I'd like to know how I can get an H1N1 vaccination.</p>
<p>Operator: Asks for street spelling and confirms postal code.</p>
<p>Operator: "Okay. Perfect. I found your address. I see you have Tuesday pick-up. Yard waste is always going to be (picked up) on your grey bin day. Okay, so ... this week you had green bin and recycling and next week you will have your green bin and garbage ... and your yard waste."</p>
<p>Caller: "Great, thanks. What about my other question?"</p>
<p>Operator: "I'm just going to check and see what I can find... Hmm. Okay, I don't see anything in our database. I'm just going to check my email because we have received information about the city's plans. If I can't answer the question, I'm sure that Toronto Public Health can. They have an excellent information line called Health Connections."</p>
<p>Operator: "Sorry it's taking so long. It should just be another moment." Gives correct number, apologizes for delay, and transfers the call to Health Connections, where it's explained the vaccine is not yet available, but hopefully will be in November. (In an announcement yesterday the province confirms it will be November.)</p>
<p>Time elapsed: Eight minutes.</p>
<p>Comment: Yard waste info is correct.</p>
<p>CALLER: I would like to get the amount of lead in my water tested.</p>
<p>Operator: Puts caller on hold for 30 seconds, says call needs to be transferred, offers the number in case it's disconnected. On hold another minute.</p>
<p>Operator 2: Asks if 311 is still on the line because that number is still showing and it's hard to hear.</p>
<p>Caller: Ignores problem, speaks louder.</p>
<p>Operator 2: Says call needs to be transferred to the Toronto Water lab.</p>

<p>Libyan Leader Moammar Gadhafi was at the U.N. today, and he gave a speech that was extremely long, rambling, and filled with inappropriate comments. As soon as Gadhafi finished, Joe Biden came up and said, "Teach me, Master."</p>
<p>* When President Obama addressed the U.N. General Assembly today, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi applauded for him, but Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad refused to applaud. But the big surprise was when Kim Jong Il started the wave.</p>
<p>* In a new book, former president Bill Clinton said he had an affair with Monica Lewinsky because he "cracked under pressure." When asked what he's doing this weekend, Clinton replied, "Cracking under pressure."</p>
<p>* Today, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin gave a speech in China. The topic of her speech was "Are you sure you're not Japan?"</p>

<p>Leaders from all over the world are here, at the U.N. They're all very busy: French President Sarkozy is jogging . . . President Obama is playing a lot of basketball . . . Prime Minister Berlusconi is getting phone numbers at Hooters . . .</p>
<p>* Yesterday President Obama brought together Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Undeniably it was awkward. They stood there and stared at each other. And then finally, after an uncomfortable period of time, they shook hands. It was like my wedding night.</p>
<p>* Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gave a hate-filled speech. In all seriousness, I'd like to say a couple of words about Ahmadinejad -- short and ugly.</p>
<p>* Osama bin Laden was supposed to address the U.N. but he dropped out at the last moment due to mercury poisoning.</p>
<p>Jimmy Fallon</p>
<p>Today, President Obama met with Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama. Or as president Bush used to call him, "Mr. Miyagi."</p>
<p>* The Japanese prime minister wanted to thank Obama for all the money Japan got for the Cash for Clunkers program.</p>
<p>* Tomorrow President Obama will become the first U.S. president to chair the U.N. Council. Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden became the first vice president to sit for six hours in a Brookstone massage chair.</p>
<p>* Obama hosted a reception for world leaders at the Waldorf-Astoria. The party was going great until Hugo Chavez started doing karaoke.</p>

<p>Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi talked at the U.N. today. He went on forever about Israel, the swine flu, and even the JFK assassination. Where was Kanye West to grab the microphone from him?</p>
<p>* Gadhafi talked so long, even Joe Biden was like, "Enough! Enough!"</p>
<p>* Terror alerts are back in the news. Earlier today the fed said they are issuing a new terror alert. They said terrorists are looking to hit successful entertainment centers . . . so the audiences at NBC are safe.</p>
<p>* There's a new book out about Barack and Michelle Obama's marriage, and in it, it says that Michelle was very upset by all these drooling blondes that would rub up against her husband. She said one blonde was particularly suggestive and was rubbing up against him. Finally Michelle said, "Look Chris Matthews, get away from my husband."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hand sanitizer at the high altar – a modern-day precaution</b>
</div><div>CAROLINE ALPHONSO   </div>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- Peace be with you. Pass the hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>The antiseptic smell of alcohol-based disinfectant has been added to the hallowed traditions of religious ceremony as churches, synagogues and mosques across the country look to protect worshippers from the pandemic influenza virus that has infected thousands and killed more than 3,000 worldwide.</p>
<p>Modern-day precautions have seeped into century-old traditions: A bow or nod will do for the sign of peace; take a pass on the common cup of wine; a squirt of hand sanitizer at the high altar is no faux pas; and if you're sick, it's not a sin to skip weekend service.</p>
<p>“You don't want to see the breakdown of community because people are terrorized by the possibility they might come down with something when they come to church,” said Ven. John Bailey of Holy Trinity Cathedral, an Anglican church in New Westminster, B.C.</p>
<p>Before launching into his sermon, he reminds churchgoers of good hygienic practices. He squirts disinfectant – and makes sure all see – after wishing them the sign of peace. And his church is even looking to add hand sanitizers at the end of each pew, on top of the handful they have scattered around the cathedral.</p>
<p>Archdeacon Bailey said it is customary for priests to wash their hands before handling the bread and wine. “It's always been part of our rite,” he said. “Now, we've added in Purell as part of that process.”</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus, which has been circulating all summer, has sickened hundreds of students this week at a handful of British Columbia schools – and religious believers are not immune.</p>
<p>Posters signalling the threat of H1N1 flu are displayed all over the Islamic Foundation of Toronto, a mosque that has 500 people on average attending prayer services. Alongside the posters, and on every floor, are hand sanitizer stations.</p>
<p>“We continue to educate people and keep reminding them,” spokesman Shakil Akhter said.</p>
<p>Holy Blossom Temple, also in Toronto, went a step further. As many as 5,000 worshippers are moving through the synagogue during the 10-day high holidays. Clergy and staff sent an e-mail to the congregation last week asking those who are sick to stay home, and others to refrain from shaking hands and embracing. Rabbis did not participate in a receiving line at the end of service this past weekend.</p>
<p>The changes raised a few eyebrows, but executive director Benjamin Applebaum said the synagogue has to strike a balance between panicking the congregation and continuing on with its usual religious services.</p>
<p>“We're mindful. We're watching the situation. I think we're taking reasonable precautions,” Mr. Applebaum said. “We're advising the congregation, and trying to alert them.”</p>
<p>At the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamilton, some churches have gone so far as to remove the holy water in the fonts.</p>
<p>It's not a recommendation from the bishop. But he has listed six directives to his 122 parishes. Among them: Parishioners should not shake hands during the sign of the peace; communion should be distributed in the hand, not on the tongue; and churchgoers should not drink wine from the cup during the celebration of the Eucharist.</p>
<p>Some felt the diocese was overreacting to a flu that has not killed as many as seasonal influenza; others were appreciative of the efforts. But not everyone has abided by the interim measures.</p>
<p>“It takes time. It's almost like a cultural change,” diocese spokesman John O'Brien said. “During the mass you do certain things in a certain manner, because they have a certain symbolism attached to them. We don't want to minimize any of the rich symbolism that we have that's part of the mass.</p>
<p>“At the same time, we want to be prudent in taking precautions in the event that this strain of H1N1, or any other influenza strain for that matter, becomes more dangerous to our parishioners.”</p>

</p>
<p>Pop quiz: Who is the President of Indonesia? If you knew the answer was Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, award yourself a gold sticker in the shape of the Wikipedia logo. But if you're among the 99% of readers who didn't, don't worry: You're in good company.</p>
<p>Virtually no one could pick the leader of the world's most populous Muslim state out of a lineup for one simple reason: because Indonesia is a stable democracy, with a responsible government that quietly focuses its attention on domestic issues, and which fights terrorism, rather than sponsoring it. If Mr. Yudhoyono instead followed the example of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and busied himself with denying the Holocaust, sponsoring Middle East terrorists and promoting eschatological Muslim cults, then everyone would know his name. American magazines would put his face on their cover, and 60 Minutes would be hounding him for an interview.</p>
<p>The twinned fates of Messrs. Yudhoyono and Ahmadinejad symbolize the perverse state of political culture in the Muslim world -- and the equally perverse manner by which we in the West reward the worst offenders. Clowns such as Mr. Ahmadinejad are treated like rock stars, while the restrained President Yudhoyono -- last seen heading off to the G20 summit in Pittsburgh to deliver a speech about climate change -- are ignored. Maybe if Mr. Yudhoyono blamed global warming on the Jews, someone would pay attention.</p>
<p>And Mr. Ahmadinejad isn't even the biggest loon in the club of Muslim leaders -- an honour that now surely must go to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who on Wednesday treated the UN General Assembly to a 90-minute monologue that seemed to have been cribbed from the ramblings of a panhandling schizophrenic. After a lackey introduced the Libyan dictator as "the king of kings of Africa," Mr. Gaddafitried to tear up the UN Charter, demanded a new investigation of the assassinations of JFK and Martin Luther King, called the Security Council a "terror council," spread crackpot theories about the origin of swine flu, and urged the creation of a single Jewish-Palestinian state called "Isratine" (which sounds like the kind of stomach medicine you take when you visit the less reputable parts of South America).</p>
<p>Oh, and let's not forget Egyptian Culture Minister Farouk Hosni, who this week was denied the leadership of UNESCO after it emerged that he had pledged to burn any Israeli books he found in his country's libraries -- a declaration that he made as part of a one-upmanship campaign with Egypt's even more phobic and Israel-hating Muslim Brotherhood movement (which, for its part, had accused Mr. Hosni of being homosexual -- the proof being that he tolerated unveiled women).</p>
<p>This is what Muslim political "leadership" has descended to in the Middle East: a general farce in which public figures prove their bona fides by denying the Holocaust, baiting Jews and accusing one another of being a heretic or a homosexual. Western liberals and NGOs are forever wringing their hands over the causes of Islamophobia. May we humbly suggest that the main source of the problem is the nonsense coming out of the mouths of Muslim leaders themselves?</p>
<p>The great irony is that many Islamists and Arab nationalists like to blame the backward state of Muslim civilization on Western "imperialism." Yet the few parts of the Muslim world that have made any substantial political progress are those that have embraced democracy (such as Indonesia) and otherwise opened themselves up to Western influences. The two politically freest parts of the Arab world, for instance, are Iraq and the "occupied" Israeli West Bank. Indeed, even some of the Jewish state's fiercest Palestinian critics will concede -- in between shouts of "Death to Israel" -- that proximity to Israel's vibrant democracy has infused local Arab politics.</p>
<p>Responding to Mr. Hosni's loss of the UNESCO job this week, Egyptian newspapers blamed it on "a clash of civilizations" and the machinations of the "Jewish lobby." But Egypt's culture minister and the region's various leaders don't seem to need "Jewish" help in making asses of themselves on the world stage. Instead of endlessly blaming their problems on the West, perhaps the angry men of Islam might like to look to Jakarta to see how a grown-up Muslim politician conducts himself.</p>

</p>
<p>The Vancouver Canucks scored three times in 61/2 minutes in the third period, then snatched a 4-3 shootout victory last night against the San Jose Sharks to remain perfect in the National Hockey League preseason.</p>
<p>Too bad it's September instead of June. Still, 6-0 at any time is impressive and the Canucks clearly have something going for them as they steam towards the start of the regular season in one week.</p>
<p>Even on a night when they were dull and dreadful for most of the first 47 minutes, the Canucks found a way to win. Mason Raymond scored a spectacular shootout winner, beating goalie Evgeni Nabokov with a spinarama backhand.</p>
<p>Raymond, on a rebound set up by Yann Sauve's quick release from the slot, started the Canuck comeback from a 2-0 deficit at 7:22 of the third period.</p>
<p>Alex Edler's seeing-eye shot through rush-hour traffic tied it 2-2 at 13:16 a few seconds after Alex Burrows won cleanly an offensive-zone faceoff.</p>
<p>One shift later, Steve Bernier set up Tanner Glass in the slot for the go-ahead goal at 13:58. But Sharks' prospect Benn Ferriero tied it on a power-play deflection with 1:09 remaining in regulation time.</p>
<p>The only bad news for the Canucks was none of their young players actually competing for NHL employment did anything attention grabbing. Michael Grabner and Cody Hodgson sat out most of third-period comeback on the Vancouver bench.</p>
<p>Hodgson, the boy wonder set back by a summer back injury, never made it out of neutral. And Grabner, who would need an H1N1 flu outbreak in the dressing room to make the team, extended his anonymity streak to five games. Even Jannik Hansen, the bubble veteran whose chances at retaining his spot are enhanced by a lower salary and waiver requirements, showed little of his usual dash.</p>
<p>The best young Canuck was probably defenceman Sauve, who arrived in training camp holding a non-refundable return ticket to junior.</p>
<p>With Hodgson's line caught on a counter-attack, San Jose went ahead 1-0 at 1:54 of the second period when Joe Thornton's shot hit Ferriero, freezing Vancouver goalie Roberto Luongo and giving Ferriero room to tuck in the puck.</p>
<p>Kent Huskins made it 2-0 on a power play at 18:21 with a sharp-angle shot that may have hit Canuck defender Alex Edler.</p>
<p>Flames 5, Oilers 3</p>
<p>- EDMONTON -- Curtis Glencross scored twice and Jarome Iginla had a power-play goal in the Calgary Flames' 5-3 exhibition</p>
<p>victory over the Edmonton Oilers.</p>
<p>Jason Jaffray and Fredrik Sjostrom also scored for the Flames (3-2-1), and Theo Fleury had an assist in his bid to land a spot on his old team after a six-year absence from the NHL. Dustin Penner, J.F. Jacques and Mike Comrie scored for the Oilers (3-3).</p>
<p>Calgary got off to a quick start, opening the scoring 1:34 into the first period. Edmonton goalie Nikolai Khabibulin lost the handle trying to stop a puck behind the net and Glencross fished it out and fired it into the empty net.</p>
<p>Edmonton responded just 3 minutes later when a shot by Jason Strudwick caromed off the boards and right to Penner battling in front of the net.</p>
<p>The Oilers took a 2-1 lead just shy of midway through the first.</p>
<p>Jacques -- playing on the first line with Ales Hemsky and Shawn Horcoff -- continued to make a claim on a regular roster spot, taking a feed from Tom Gilbert and sending a hard shot from in tight on goalie Miikka Kiprusoff that somehow slipped past.</p>
<p>Calgary evened the game up again two minutes later on a two-man advantage, with Iginla snapping a shot from the side of the net that beat Khabibulin between the legs.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canadians willing to sacrifice personal freedoms in a pandemic</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey </div>

<div>297 words</div><div>24 September 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A24</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province </div>
</p>
<p>Canadians are bullish on giving government officials permission to restrict personal freedoms in a flu pandemic, with half of those surveyed agreeing that violation of a quarantine order would be tantamount to manslaughter.</p>
<p>As well, 90 per cent of Canadians believe doctors and nurses have an obligation to report to work during a pandemic, provided safety precautions are in place. Almost half (48 per cent) say that health-care workers who do not show up for work without a legitimate excuse should be fired or lose their professional licences.</p>
<p>A survey of 600 Canadians -- conducted by the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics before the H1N1 outbreak began -- comes as officials brace for an anticipated second wave of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Past surveys have suggested anywhere from 25 to 85 per cent of health-care workers would be unwilling to show up for work in a pandemic.</p>
<p>"If you think of it, that's a pretty stunning number," says Dr. Ross Upshur, director of the U of T bioethics centre, which Wednesday released a series of research papers on pandemic ethics. He says regulatory bodies haven't set clear directives on what they expect of health-care professionals in a disease crisis.</p>
<p>A large majority (85 per cent) of Canadians surveyed agreed that governments should have the power to suspend some individual rights, such as travelling and the right to assemble, during a flu pandemic.</p>
<p>"Canadians are accepting of duly issued orders by public health authorities if they're clearly communicated," Upshur said. Asking people to suspend their civil liberties "is legitimate, for a time limited period, if it's clearly communicated and measures for support are put in place," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Libya rants, Iran roars, Canada walks out; Ahmadinejad's speech caps a surreal day at UN</b>
</div><div>Mitch Potter </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>807 words</div><div>24 September 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star </div>
</p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS -- The day began with U.S. President Barack Obama promising a new era of global engagement. Then Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi stepped up to tell the world swine flu might be a plot by drug companies.</p>
<p>Finally, firebrand Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad delivered a furious diatribe condemning capitalism and Israel. Canada and other nations stood up and walked out in protest.</p>
<p>His remarks capped a surreal day that saw a parade of 32 world leaders address the launch of the 64th UN General Assembly, including those of China, Britain, France, Russia and Brazil.</p>
<p>As pressure mounts over Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program, Ahmadinejad used the platform of the UN summit to push back.</p>
<p>He cited the global recession as evidence "the engine of unbridled capitalism has reached the end of the road" and said corrupted institutions like the UN are "incapable" of reform.</p>
<p>He railed against Israeli injustice in the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>Speaking calmly, and at times contradictorily, the Iranian leader used glowing terms to describe the violence-marred vote that returned him to power this year, calling it a "glorious and fully democratic election."</p>
<p>And he ended, 35 minutes later, on an uncharacteristically upbeat note, vowing that despite all grievances, Iran was ready and "prepared to warmly shake hands with those extended to us."</p>
<p>Canada's hands, in particular, were nowhere in sight. As Ahmadinejad took the stage, a senior government minister subbing for Prime Minister Stephen Harper stormed out in a gesture of political outrage.</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon, standing in for Harper as nearly 100 world leaders gathered to hear Obama map out a new era of global engagement, signalled his intent to shun the controversial Iranian president hours before the fact.</p>
<p>"This is the strongest form of vigorously denouncing Iran for its violation of human rights, denouncing Iran for its non-respect of United Nations Security Council Resolutions, denouncing Iran because ultimately they don't recognize there was a Holocaust," Cannon told the Toronto Star on the steps of the UN's headquarters in New York.</p>
<p>Canada was joined in its boycott by the Israeli delegation. Deeper into the speech, the U.S. delegates also walked away. And by the end, barely half of the General Assembly hall was occupied, although many delegations made no attempt to attend.</p>
<p>The mood was welcoming for the most part, with many leaders congratulating Obama for a keynote speech that signalled the awakening U.S. interest in finding collective solutions for the world's most urgent issues.</p>
<p>"Those who used to chastise America for acting alone in the world cannot now stand by and wait for America to solve the world's problems alone," Obama told a packed UN General Assembly hall. "Now is the time for all of us to take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges."</p>
<p>He said "an almost reflexive anti-Americanism" that swept the globe while George W. Bush was in office is not "an excuse for collective inaction.</p>
<p>"Nothing is easier than blaming others for our troubles and absolving ourselves of responsibility for our choices and our actions."</p>
<p>But the day had its mercurial moments as well, most memorably a marathon rant by Gadhafi that stretched 95 minutes - more than six times his apportioned time.</p>
<p>Gadhafi, in his first-ever visit to New York, directed most of his fury at the UN Security Council's power structure. But his conspiratorial rhetoric included bizarre asides, including suggestions that "swine flu" may be an evil plot by pharmaceutical makers and the assassination of John F. Kennedy might have been the work of Israeli agents.</p>
<p>Cannon told the Star he was conducting a bilateral meeting at the time and thus did not attend Gadhafi's speech - sparing himself the need to decide whether it was worthy of a walkout.</p>
<p>"If you look at President Obama's speech today and focus more on that than Mr. Gadhafi's speech," the day was a resounding success, he said. "(Obama's) call to action where everyone should renew, as he said, the United Nations and get back on track - that in itself was a very strong, positive message."</p>
<p>In Oakville yesterday, Harper defended the Canadian boycott, citing Ahmadinejad's "absolutely repugnant" comments on the Holocaust and Israel.</p>
<p>"There are times when things are being said in this world that it is important that countries that have a moral compass stand up, make their views known," Harper said. "Our absence will speak volumes about how Canada feels about the declarations of President Ahmadinejad."</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The federal government appeared far more interested earlier this year in winning the public relations war with respect to the H1N1 virus than preparing for a possible pandemic, critics says.</p>
<p>In a four-week period, the Public Health Agency of Canada awarded a flurry of sole-source public relations contracts totalling almost $709,000, while opposition parties were urging the government to take immediate action on coping with the swine flu.</p>
<p>"Self-interest trumps public interest again," said Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's), who is a family physician.</p>
<p>Bennett said what Canadians need now is solid, practical information, not political spin on a contagious virus that so far has killed 76 Canadians.</p>
<p>"They have to build the confidence of every Canadian so they know what to do when the second wave hits," Bennett said.</p>
<p>New Democrat MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis said it has been nearly impossible to get information on the government's pandemic plan.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq can approve sole-source contracts up to $100,000, four times the usual limit, if there is a pressing emergency or when only one person or firm can do the job, among other things, a Treasury Board official said.</p>
<p>But Wasylycia-Leis said "there is no basis for Health Canada to be using the clauses under the Emergency Preparedness Act to avoid open tender when we are dealing with a possible pandemic that was well known many, many months ago and where there was enormous amounts of time to do thoughtful open tenders."</p>
<p>"Clearly their emphasis has been more on public relations or spinning the public than on actual preparedness and planning on a national basis for the pandemic," said the Winnipeg South MP.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the public health agency came under fire for its lack of communications during last year's listeriosis outbreak that killed 22 Canadians.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the public health agency said it invoked Treasury Board guidelines for emergency contracting to allow it to "respond immediately in emergency situations, such as the exceptional circumstances presented by the H1N1 influenza outbreak.</p>
<p>"Given that PHAC needs to respond to the H1N1 flu pandemic requirements in a timely manner, and that delays may be injurious to public health, PHAC has respected Treasury Board guidelines," said Jirina Vlk. "The contracts about ... are in place to supplement existing resources at the Public Health Agency of Canada due to an increase in the workload related to the H1N1 flu pandemic."</p>
<p>She said the contracts were issued for the development of communications products and plans, media relations support and issues and crisis management.</p>
<p>Public health agency officials are concerned the H1N1 virus will be more virulent when flu season hits this fall.</p>

</p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS -- Moammar Gadhafi waited 40 years for his turn at the United Nations microphone. He was not about to let the moment pass quickly.</p>
<p>In a rambling, largely improvised 95-minute address to the UN General Assembly, the controversial Libyan leader let it fly in all directions, beginning with an attack on the UN itself, which he called a "terrorist" organization on par with Al Qaeda due to a format that favours the will of the mighty over the weak.</p>
<p>Gadhafi's attack on the veto power wielded by the UN Security Council's five permanent members was the first salvo in a marathon rant that wore out two UN translators. Among the more striking claims, many of which prompted peals of laughter from the press corps:</p>
<p>The Libyan leader called for new investigations of all conflicts and political assassinations since World War II, including the killing of John F. Kennedy, which he said might have been the work of Israelis.</p>
<p>Gadhafi praised Barack Obama as a "son of Africa," expressed hope the U.S. president would become leader for life, but worried that the post-Obama America will revert to its former place on the world stage.</p>
<p>Positioning himself as a champion of post-colonial indemnification, Gadhafi called for $7.7 trillion in restitution for Africa. Until the debt is paid, Gadhafi called for immigration without limits to allow Africans to migrate to Europe to share in the wealth that was stolen from them.</p>
<p>In a rambling aside about the jet lag many world leaders suffer in the journey to New York, Gadhafi called for the UN headquarters to be relocated to the "middle" or "Eastern hemisphere." Gadhafi said America would welcome the move.</p>
<p>Addressing the dangers of swine flu, Gadhafi suggested the ailment was deliberately released by profit-seeking pharmaceutical firms. He said "fish flu" may be next.</p>
<p>Gadhafi attacked the NATO-led effort in Afghanistan as folly, saying he was doing Western allies a favour by speaking so frankly. "If I really want to deceive my friends in America and Britain I would encourage them to send more troops to this bloodbath." Instead, Gadhafi suggested Afghanistan be abandoned to battle internally for its future, even if all-out civil war resulted. He compared the Taliban to the Vatican, describing both as "religious states" and observing that Al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden was neither Taliban nor Afghan.</p>
<p>Calling for a probe into the hanging of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, Gadhafi wondered if his masked hangmen were the then-leaders of the U.S. and U.K.</p>
<p>Gadhafi's surreal speech - his first to the UN, 40 years after seizing power in oil-rich Libya - followed Obama's address in which the U.S. president called for a new era of international engagement and an end to the grandstanding that so often infuses UN discourse.</p>
<p>The Libyan leader appeared to lose his place in his speech notes several times, and instead used the UN charter as a prop during his 30-minute attack on the organization. At one point, he began to tear apart the document but then set it down.</p>
<p>During his speech, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown referenced Gadhafi's behaviour, saying: "I stand here to defend the UN charter, not to tear it up."</p>
<p>Brown had no small role to play in the back story of Gadhafi's controversial visit, with many observers accusing the British government of meddling for economic advantage in the case that saw a convicted Lockerbie bomber released to Libyan custody last month.</p>
<p>The saga sparked outrage in the United States and led to an awkward diplomatic shuffle as U.S. diplomats scrambled for a discreet location for Gadhafi to pitch his Bedouin tent. New York media outlets reported the tent found a home on a property owned by celebrity investor Donald Trump. But Trump's organization denied any direct dealings with the Libyan leader.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Research questions whether seasonal flu shot raises H1N1 risk</b>
</div><div>By Helen Branswell </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Unpublished Canadian research is raising concerns about whether it's a good idea to get a seasonal flu shot this season.</p>
<p>Drawn from a series of studies from British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario, the data appear to suggest that people who got a seasonal flu shot last year are at higher risk of catching H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>A scientific paper is in the publication pipeline and the authors won't speak to the media.</p>
<p>While few people appear to have actually read the study, the puzzling findings have been a poorly kept secret and many in the public health community in Canada and elsewhere have heard about them.</p>
<p>Some officials in this country have used the unconfirmed evidence to push for a delay or even a cancellation of this year's seasonal flu shot campaigns across the country.</p>
<p>The findings are causing consternation abroad as well, with officials at public health agencies and even at the World Health Organization worried the alleged link will deter people from getting flu shots in a fall when many people are being asked to get both seasonal and pandemic vaccine.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada, which has been seeking international assistance to help make sense of the findings, was being cautious Wednesday, reluctant to speak while the paper is being peer reviewed by an unnamed journal.</p>
<p>But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control knows of the work.</p>
<p>And it said it has looked for similar evidence in the United States but sees none.</p>
<p>"It is difficult to speak about a study that has yet to be published, however, as this is an important issue involving the subject of seasonal influenza and the fast-moving global pandemic of 2009 H1N1 influenza it is important to note the scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not seen this effect in systems we have reviewed in the United States," spokesperson Joe Quimby said by email.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>More vaccines than virtue; Canadians should be embarrassed by our government's refusal to share surplus H1N1 flu shots with less fortunate countries</b>
</div><div>Amir Attaran </div>
<div>Citizen Special</div>
<div>1021 words</div><div>24 September 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>Bid farewell to summer, welcome to fall -- and hold on tight for Canada's flu season, which is becoming an incipient international embarrassment.</p>
<p>Because of a single technical decision in the Public Health Agency of Canada -- a decision to use a new but more efficient "adjuvenated" vaccine -- the H1N1 flu vaccine is being deployed in Canada later than other countries.</p>
<p>It is a controversial decision. The Canadian Medical Association Journal recently panned it, because the new, adjuvenated vaccine will take weeks longer than the standard, unadjuvenated vaccine to gain government approval and roll out. Without timely vaccine, the CMAJ's editors reasoned, susceptible persons to influenza (mainly the old, the very young, and health care workers) could get sick, and perhaps die.</p>
<p>But now hear PHAC's reply: By choosing the more efficient adjuvenated vaccine, Canada consumes less of the global supply of crucial raw material than those choosing the unadjuvenated vaccine, such as the United States.</p>
<p>"Rather than hogging all of that material," explains Canada's chief public health officer, David Butler-Jones, PHAC's way "provides it for the rest of the world."</p>
<p>Nobly Canadian, you might think? Our national mythology is that, unlike greedy Americans, we choose to sacrifice for the common good. And it would be noble, if only it were true.</p>
<p>Canada is not sharing influenza vaccine with the rest of the world. Not only is that highly selfish of us, but it again calls into question why the most at-risk Canadians are being made to wait for adjuvenated vaccine, when our commitment to providing for others is hypothetical at best.</p>
<p>Last week, as Stephen Harper was tooling around Washington and talking up Canada's virtues, across town a more substantially moral leader, Barack Obama, announced a global plan to donate life-saving influenza vaccines to poor countries in Africa, Asia and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Those donations are likely to be, for many countries, the only vaccine that they get. Heeding the World Health Organization's call, Australia, Britain, Brazil, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland also went along with the donation plan.</p>
<p>Canada, however, declined.</p>
<p>So here is the ugly truth of the matter: Even as the Obama administration committed to donate 10 per cent of America's vaccines to less fortunate countries, the Harper government committed to donate zero. All our government will say is that Canada is "committed to collaborating with the World Health Organization," not that, heaven forbid, we would actually share the vaccine they are urgently asking for. Who's the greedy one now?</p>
<p>Quite how disgraceful this is is difficult to exaggerate. Unlike the countries actually donating the vaccine, Canada is in a much better place to give some away. Canada possesses one of the world's few influenza vaccine factories, which means that 100 per cent of our needs can be domestically manufactured. The federal government has a contract with the factory's owner, which gives Canada first dibs on the vaccine ahead of any other country.</p>
<p>With 50.4 million doses of vaccine in Canada's entitlement, and 32 million Canadians, perhaps only half of whom want to be vaccinated, PHAC officials are certainly correct that we have "more than enough for any Canadian that wants to receive it."</p>
<p>Not every country is so privileged. The United States has too few influenza vaccine factories and imports most of its needs. Norway has zero factories and imports all its needs. Brazil is a developing country struggling to afford vaccine for its citizens. Yet those countries are donating 10 per cent of the vaccine they have. Even <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, the pharmaceutical company, is donating nearly as many doses of vaccine to the World Health Organization as Canada is buying from it.</p>
<p>You might think Canada should hold on to its extra vaccine because, well, you never know. But that reasoning is as scientifically wrong as it is stingy. So long as persons travel internationally -- a fact that is not about to change -- Canada must care about stanching the influenza pandemic elsewhere, lest more of it, or more dangerous strains, eventually travel here. Donating excess vaccine to poor countries that can't afford it protects our interests. But hoarding excess vaccine until it goes to pot protects nobody's interests. With disease defences, as frequently with military defences, collective security is the name of this game.</p>
<p>President Obama gets it. As he said to launch the global vaccine donations, "The United States recognizes that, just as this challenge transcends borders, so must our response. We invite other nations to join in this urgent global health effort." How odd it must have seemed to him that our prime minister travelled to Washington to whinge about "Buy American," while having nothing to say about "Give Canadian."</p>
<p>The Harper government must do better than continue its mean streak. In this, and much else to do with international aid, poorer foreigners notice Canada's new beggar-thy-neighbour attitude, and wonder how a country once known for its generosity has fallen so far. The usual preening about Canadian internationalism is nonsense, where WHO has justly called on Canada to share a life-saving resource, and we refuse.</p>
<p>So when will those foreigners start complaining out loud about Canada's churlishness? Perhaps sometime around the giving season known as Christmas. That is, traditionally, just before the peak of influenza incidence in the northern hemisphere, where most of the world's people live. If Canada's government has not donated by then, we are at substantial risk of not just influenza, but of making international assess of ourselves.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Obama's lesson in sharing; Issuing a call for ‘new era of engagement,' U.S. President stresses collective action to deal with Iran, terrorism and global warming</b>
</div><div>CAMPBELL CLARK </div>
<div>1498 words</div><div>24 September 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>NEW YORK -- In a clear and dramatic break with the Bush doctrine of unilateral action, U.S. President Barack Obama pledged a “new era of engagement” with the world yesterday, an appeal aimed at winning co-operation in dealing with vexing security issues such as containing Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>
<p>Wielding both rhetorical carrot and stick, Mr. Obama used his first official address to the United Nations General Assembly to outline a vision of collective action across a range of issues, from terrorism to global warming.</p>
<p>“Those who used to chastise America for acting alone in the world cannot now stand by and wait for America to solve the world's problems alone. We have sought – in word and deed – a new era of engagement with the world. And now is the time for all of us to take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges,” he said.</p>
<p>Building on themes articulated in his presidential campaign and developed in the first nine months of his administration, the doctrine outlined by Mr. Obama promised international co-operation with others, but insisted the United States gets a quid pro quo on key concerns, including some of the same ones pressed by his predecessor George W. Bush: international terrorists and preventing their safe haven in Afghanistan, and Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>
<p>The speech garnered warm applause, and sent a buzz through a UN building packed with government leaders and foreign ministers.</p>
<p>“Everybody was very energized by the speech,” Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said.</p>
<p>“North Korea and Iran are the two underlying issues in all this. Iran is probably more acute,” said Bruce Jones, a scholar with the Washington-based Brookings Institution, whose work on building a new international order to promote security has clearly been influential in the Obama administration.</p>
<p>“A large part of the diplomacy – not just the speech, but the diplomacy – is to try to create the conditions for an effective coalition to deal with Iran, one way or another.”</p>
<p>The Obama diplomacy starts from an understanding that the United States is the most powerful country in the world, but unable to accomplish crucial steps alone, Mr. Jones said. “So the U.S. is indispensable, but insufficient.”</p>
<p>Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was in the audience as Mr. Obama laid out fears that the nuclear-weapons ambitions of Iran and North Korea could send the world into regional crises and war.</p>
<p>“In their actions to date, the governments of North Korea and Iran have threatened to take us down this dangerous slope,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama knows the United States alone cannot persuade or cajole Iran into abandoning its nuclear weapons, and the pressure for war, either through Israeli bombing or a U.S.-led campaign, could become irresistible. Countries such as Russia and China, if they agree to work in concert with the United States, could help to prevent such a confrontation.</p>
<p>Mr. Ahmadinejad's presence sparked controversy when the Canadian delegation, and those of a number of other countries, walked out during the Iranian President's speech, to protest his past attacks on Israel and his denial of the holocaust.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama's speech, however, was clearly designed to tell world leaders the United States is breaking with Mr. Bush's era of unilateralism, and it follows on a stream of calls for rebuilding U.S. diplomacy.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama opened by listing some of his administration's breaks with the past, such as his decree ordering the closing of Guantanamo Bay and his prohibition on U.S. government agents using torture, as well as his willingness to take action on climate change and to seek reductions of nuclear weapons and a treaty banning nuclear tests.</p>
<p>He outlined four pillars of international co-operation: preventing nuclear proliferation and working toward nuclear disarmament; promoting peace and combatting terrorism; preserving the planet; and building an equitable and growing global economy.</p>
<p>The speech has been accompanied by an unparalleled week of multilateralism by a U.S. president.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama spoke to a UN summit on climate change on Tuesday, addressed the UN General Assembly yesterday, and will today become the first U.S. president to personally chair the UN Security Council – for a meeting on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Members are expected to approve a resolution toughening non-proliferation rules. Then Mr. Obama heads to Pittsburgh to host a summit of G20 leaders.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama, engaged in bruising domestic debates on issues such as health care, is now more popular abroad than at home. But many countries – the potential partners he seeks – are still uncertain whether he is outlining a lasting direction for the United States, or whether the country will revert to unilateralism.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones, the influential scholar, suggested Mr. Obama needs some domestic wins, such as getting Senate backing on a nuclear-test-ban treaty, to persuade doubters in foreign capitals.</p>
<p>***********</p>
<p>From a torn-up charter to walking out in protest, leaders' speeches cause quite the stir</p>
<p>Moammar Gadhafi</p>
<p>In his first ever United Nations speech, the Libyan leader grabbed his 15 minutes of fame, and then some. Introduced as the “king of kings” by his countryman and assembly president Ali Treki, he remained in his seat long after the introduction. After waiting for the room to settle, Col. Gadhafi rose, swept his robe over him and strode to the stage, using the handrail on his way up. He wore a shiny black pin in the shape of Africa over his heart. He received scattered applause and Israel's delegation walked out.</p>
<p>Over one hour and 40 minutes – six times his allotment – he tore up a copy of the UN charter in front of startled delegates, accused the Security Council of being an al-Qaeda-like terrorist body, called for former U.S. president George W. Bush and former British prime minister Tony Blair to be put on trial for the Iraq war, demanded $7.7-trillion in compensation for the ravages of colonialism on Africa, and wondered whether swine flu was a biological weapon created in a military laboratory. He even demanded to know who was behind the killing of John F. Kennedy.</p>
<p>Amid the ranting, his most valid point may have been lost when he chastised the world body for failing to prevent some 65 wars since the UN was founded in 1945.</p>
<p>Nicolas Sarkozy</p>
<p>For a conservative French President, Mr. Sarkozy sounded downright liberal, condemning “the behaviour of those who still continue to grow indecently rich, after leading the world to the brink of disaster” and calling for a vast overhaul of the world's financial system.</p>
<p>France has moved to curb bonuses to its bankers, and is urging the other G20 countries and the European Union to follow suit so the French banking industry is not at a professional disadvantage.</p>
<p>He spurned the efforts of the insider's club of wealthy nations known as the G8: the United States, Britain, Italy, France, Germany, Canada, Japan and Russia. “We need new global governance for political, economic and the environment,” he said. “In dealing with the crisis, we all know that the G8 would not have had the strength authority or legitimacy shown by the G20,” Mr. Sarkozy said. The Group of 20 includes the G8 but also emerging economic powers such as India, China and Brazil.</p>
<p>He then returned to his conservative roots by turning his attention to Iran, warning the Islamic republic it risked a “tragic mistake” if it banked on the world remaining passive as it pursues its nuclear program.</p>
<p>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</p>
<p>The Iranian President's denial of the Holocaust and his views on Israel have caused much of the world to recoil, and a number of delegations, including Canada's, walked out in protest as Mr. Ahmadinejad began speaking. He fulfilled what was likely their worst fears by continuing in a characteristic vein on the subject of the Jewish state:</p>
<p>“The awakening of nations and the expansion of freedom worldwide will no longer allow them to continue their hypocrisy and vicious attitudes.”</p>
<p>“How can one imagine that the inhuman policies in Palestine may continue?” he said.</p>
<p>“How can crimes of the occupiers against defenseless women and children and destruction of their homes, farms, hospitals and schools be supported unconditionally by certain governments?”</p>
<p>The Iranian leader said it was time for the world to respond.</p>
<p>“It is no longer acceptable that a small minority would dominate the politics, economy and culture of major parts of the world by its complicated networks, and establish a new form of slavery, and harm the reputation of other nations, even European nations and the U.S., to attain its racist ambitions.”</p>

<p>If you're one of those people who is all, “Oh, like that would ever happen,” then go away now. Mosey on over to some other section and look for something else to read.</p>
<p>Thing is, you'll have a tough time finding material that doesn't boggle the mind yet is actually anchored in reality. Things happen. Strange and disturbing things that once seemed like the product of paranoid imaginations. Swine flu. Climate change. People disappearing off the street. The NDP keeping the Conservative Party in power.</p>
<p>If you like mystery, suspense and countless twists in the story, stick with me. If you're ready for massive leaps in logic and you're prepped for getting hooked on a nonsensical story that has tons of action, stay here. The big one starts tonight. The big new show. The one the critics like and the producers figure will have people addicted for years.</p>
<p>FlashForward (ABC, A, 8 p.m.) is it, and it's loosely based on a novel by Canadian writer Robert J. Sawyer. In the terrific but somewhat soapy opening episode tonight we are presented with a grave and puzzling scenario. We're in Los Angeles, and we meet cop Mark (Joseph Fiennes), a recovering alcoholic who lives with his surgeon wife Olivia (Sonya Walger), and their daughter. On this day, Mark is chasing suspects possibly involved in some terrorist plot, and Olivia is operating on a patient. Then the world stops. Literally, it stops. Eventually it becomes clear that every person on Earth has lost consciousness for two minutes and 17 seconds. And in that brief time, everyone gets a glimpse of their life on April 29, 2010. What the heck happened? A freak accident of nature or some nefarious plot?</p>
<p>We follow as a core group of characters probe the source and meaning of the worldwide disaster. The large scale of events is distilled into the small worries of the characters – in Mark's wife's glimpse into the future, she's with another man, not him. Another character has no glimpse of the future and he worries that means he is dead by April 29, 2010.</p>
<p>It's a flashy and gripping start. The producers have talked with glee about their long-term plans for the show. Their optimism is justified – FlashForward has “hit” written all over it.</p>
<p>FlashForward is not ABC's new Lost, as was the buzz this summer. Lost is entering its last season, and ABC needs a new long-running hit that is intriguing enough to develop a fanatical following. But FlashForward is a more straightforward series, on the evidence of the pilot. Intriguing and entertaining, yes. But it is unlikely to meander as far, wide and deep as Lost.</p>
<p>Pedal Power (CBC, 8 p.m.) is a new Canadian doc about bikes and bike culture. It's good, and among the topics tackled by producer Robin Benger is the notorious Igor Kenk, who was arrested for theft last year in Toronto and found to have 2,865 bikes stashed away in various places around the city. Kenk appears often here, before his arrest, during the arrest and when he was out on bail. But the doc is really about what it calls “the bike revolution” and “bike culture.” It suggests that the worldwide interest in the Kenk case “signals a tipping point in the history of urban culture.” And “bicycling, once seen as a simple pleasure from childhood, has become a political act.”</p>
<p>What it doesn't do is delve into the fact that “bike culture” is a toxic issue in a city like Toronna. It provokes rage and the sort of high moral indignation that is, in fact, repulsive. Like everyone in Toronna, I've got an opinion on it. The program touches on those “Critical Mass” events where large groups of cyclists take over the roads. I witnessed one of them last year. I was waiting for a streetcar on Queen Street West and the streetcar didn't come for almost an hour because the street was filled with cyclists. Also waiting was an elderly neighbour, a lady on her way to a hospital to visit her ill husband. As we all waited, one of those smug dorks on a bike lectured us about getting with the bike revolution. It was cute, middleclass cant. The needs of an elderly woman, concerned about her husband, and taking public transport, mattered nothing to these pompous asses on bikes. I wonder if their moms are proud of them.

<div id="hd"><b>Hamrlik back on track for Habs</b>
</div><div>DAVE STUBBS   </div>

</p>
<p>Canadiens defenceman Roman Hamrlik is pretty much recovered from the throat ailment that forced him to trade his skates for slippers for five days.</p>
<p>He might want to look into the idea that he's allergic to training camp.</p>
<p>Hamrlik, with Andrei Markov one of this season's valuable, veteran anchors of the Montreal blue line, skated through a lung-searing workout yesterday in Brossard, his first in nearly a week.</p>
<p>When he wasn't focused on the instructions of head coach Jacques Martin, he was looking around in a vain attempt to find the thief who had stolen his breath.</p>
<p>Hamrlik, 35, said he was felled by a throat virus - not the swine flu, he assured a few reporters who lobbed their questions from long range - and was happy to finally be out of sick bay, if only at 60- or 70-per-cent efficiency.</p>
<p>"It was a pretty intense practice, but I'm just happy to be back," Hamrlik said while downing a pink cocktail that hopefully tasted better than it looked.</p>
<p>"The hardest thing was just keeping my legs moving. The timing is going to come and the confidence will come when I start playing games. I've been in the league long enough to know what it takes to be ready (for the start of the season)." Recent history suggests that Hamrlik knows of what he speaks. Last season, he played one period and small change of the exhibition season before leaving the Canadiens' first preseason tilt a year ago yesterday with a groin injury. That hurt a lot more than the meaningless 8-3 loss to Boston in Halifax that night, even if the result was a sign of things to come between the two clubs in 2008-09.</p>
<p>Hamrlik didn't play another minute until the regular season's first game.\ But Hamrlik was healthy enough for the Oct. 10 curtain-raiser in Buffalo to play 23:24 - second in ice time only to the 28:55 of workhorse Markov - and record team highs in shots on goal (seven) and blocked shots (six).</p>
<p>The next night in Toronto, Hamrlik played a game-high 24:25, scoring his first of six goals of the season with two shots, three blocks and four hits.</p>
<p>"I don't know what's happening to me in training camp," he said with a sigh yesterday. "I think I have bad luck. Every team is skating hard and playing hard games in training camp. Unfortunately, I was getting sick. I'd rather play the games than be home, doing nothing." Nothing meant nothing - no cardio, no weights, no conditioning work. He couldn't even nurse his sore throat with ice cream, slaking his thirst and soothing a raw throat mostly with water to avoid weight gain.</p>
<p>So the Canadiens' No. 44 feels he's somewhat behind the eight-ball, without the sharpening that only game conditions provide. And he's uncertain whether he'll be ready for tonight's penultimate exhibition against the Bruins. Don't expect him before Saturday's preseason finale at the Bell Centre against Buffalo.</p>
<p>"I feel a little behind, but I'll be back on track soon," he said. "We still have a couple of days before the season and I'd like to play one game.</p>
<p>"I want to be 100 per cent. I don't want to rush back and get sick again. I'm looking forward to coming back, but I want to be healthy, too." Hamrlik has shown excellent durability during his two seasons in Montreal, missing a total of six games and not dre- - -ing only once last year. Beyond his absence, he was in no way responsible for a 6-3 blowout by the Maple Leafs in Toronto on Nov. 8 that then-head coach Guy Carbonneau candidly critiqued as "the most embarrassing game I've ever been associated with." (With at least a few more dismal efforts to come, the Toronto loss might be down Carbo's list a little today.) And it's this durability that has Hamrlik knocking on the door of 1,200 NHL games, 43 short of that milestone. Should he begin the season Oct. 1 and enjoy an uninterrupted run, he'll hit 1,200 on New Year's Eve in Florida against the Panthers.</p>
<p>He could well cross the threshold playing alongside fellow Czech Republic native Jaroslav Spacek, with whom Hamrlik won a gold medal in the 2008 Olympic winter Games in Nagano, Japan.</p>
<p>But he's hardly had time to consider his blue-line partner, given that he's barely needed his skates sharpened this camp.</p>
<p>Unlacing beside Hamrlik yesterday was fellow defenceman Paul Mara, a free-agent newcomer who also was returning to the ice after having nursed the ubiquitous "lower-body injury" back to health.</p>
<p>"He's been sick because I've been out," Mara joked of Hamrlik, having used his own time off to grow a playoff- quality beard.</p>
<p>Then, looking up at his stallmate: "Play with 22," Mara chirped of his own number.</p>
<p>"I think poor Mara is going to be my partner," agreed Hamrlik, a grin spreading onto his grizzled mug.</p>
<p>He lumbered away wearing the happy look of a guy who'd had his fill of sitting at home watching movies, downloading music and counting the minutes until he'd be back on the ice.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hog farmers still waiting for gov't aid package</b>
</div><div>Mia Rabson   </div>
<div>Winnipeg Free Press</div>
<div>508 words</div><div>24 September 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Hog producers say they're increasingly frustrated by delays in getting details on an aid package from Ottawa that could help them decide whether to refinance or get out of the business altogether.</p>
<p>It has been more than a month since Treasury Board president Vic Toews announced a three-pronged package for hog producers, including government-backed credit and a $75-million transitional fund for producers who agree to get out of hog farming for at least three years.</p>
<p>But details were sketchy at the time, and Toews promised more would be forthcoming in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Manitoba Pork Council chairman Karl Kynoch said they are being told every week that Treasury Board will give approval for the programs, but every week, it doesn't happen.</p>
<p>"The definition of 'soon' in the government's world is obviously different than it is in the producers' world," said Kynoch. "We're getting calls from producers every day. They're trying to make decisions here and they can't."</p>
<p>The aid package included between $500 million and $1 billion in government-backed credit for financial institutions to give loans to producers with solid business plans.</p>
<p>It also had a $75-million transitional fund for farmers who agree to get out of the hog business for at least three years, and $17 million to research ways to open up new foreign markets to Canadian pork.</p>
<p>But there were no details released on who would qualify, how to apply and how much each producer could get.</p>
<p>Toews did not grant an interview request Wednesday.</p>
<p>Both he and Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz released statements via their communications directors, saying the paperwork is finished and the final details are being ironed out with the Canadian Pork Council, which will deliver the program.</p>
<p>The Canadian industry has been devastated by a combination of the high Canadian dollar, a doubling of the cost of feed, new country-of-origin labelling requirements in the United States, and the stigma of H1N1 influenza, which has been referred to as swine flu. Prices are sinking and farmers now lose$30 to $40 for every hog they produce. It is expected to get worse until at least January, and Kynoch said it will be mid-2010 before farmers start seeing profits again.</p>
<p>He said this is the longest period farmers have ever seen such low prices, which are heading into their third year, he said.</p>
<p>Under new U. S. food-labelling rules, U. S. pork companies believe they have to segregate pigs born in Canada or elsewhere from those born in the U. S. Many simply stopped accepting Canadian pigs, because segregating animals is costly and inefficient. Although H1N1 influenza cannot be contracted by eating pork, the outbreak still spread fears internationally and demand for pork dropped.</p>
<p>Manitoba Agriculture Minister Rosann Wowchuk said the market problems have left Canada with an oversupply of hogs, which means the industry has to shrink in order to regroup.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Obama's call for disarmament meets Gadhafi's rambling diatribe; U.S. president asks for global commitment to end nuclear proliferation</b>
</div><div>Steven Edwards   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service, Daily Telegraph</div>
<div>989 words</div><div>24 September 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The annual summit of the United Nations opened Wednesday with a considered address by U.S. President Barack Obama and a rambling diatribe from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.</p>
<p>After Obama pledged America's re-engagement with the world body, the president of the General Assembly -- currently a Libyan -- introduced the Libyan leader as "king of kings" and "leader of the revolution."</p>
<p>Obama warned all nations have "responsibilities."</p>
<p>"Those who used to chastise America for not acting alone in the world cannot not stand by and wait for America to solve the world's problems," he told world leaders.</p>
<p>"We have sought -- in word and deed -- a new era of engagement with the world. Now is the time for all of us to take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges."</p>
<p>Obama laid out what he said were "four pillars that are fundamental" to America's goals on the world stage, among them world nuclear disarmament, starting with curtailing proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>In remarks clearly aimed at Iran, which the West suspects is seeking to develop a nuclear bomb, Obama warned there would be "consequences" for any nation that defies the world body's non-proliferation efforts.</p>
<p>"This is not about singling out individual nations; it is about standing up for the rights of all nations that do live up to their responsibilities," he said.</p>
<p>Obama will ask the world's leading powers today to sign up to an ambitious plan to control the spread of nuclear weapons with the ultimate goal of</p>
<p>removing their threat for good.</p>
<p>A leaked draft of a UN Security Council resolution said the big five nuclear powers and 10 temporary council members had agreed to "seek a safer world for all and to create the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons."</p>
<p>Obama is to outline to the Council the resolution, urging the end of the production of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium, a strengthening of the international inspections regime and an agreement for quick, deep reductions of the nuclear arsenals of America, Russia, China, France and Britain.</p>
<p>The draft document also reaffirms Obama's commitment to ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which the U.S. senate has so far blocked. Eight other nations have also refused, but if the world's biggest nuclear power led the way it is thought they would eventually follow.</p>
<p>In his address Wednesday, Obama said that non-proliferation was a cornerstone of his global vision.</p>
<p>"We must stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and seek the goal of a world without them," he said. "Today the threat of proliferation is growing in scope and complexity.</p>
<p>"If we fail to act, we will invite nuclear arms races in every region, and the prospect of wars and acts of terror on a scale that we can hardly imagine."</p>
<p>The White House hopes to win a commitment from Russia to reduce its nuclear stockpile further than the 1,500 warheads agreed in a joint statement made in London in April. The administration is hoping to reap some benefit from its decision last week to drop Bush-era plans for a missile defence system located in Poland and the Czech Republic, which Moscow had treated as a threat to its security.</p>
<p>Obama met Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian president, in advance of the Security Council meeting. Medvedev said he was optimistic the two superpowers could reach a nuclear arms deal by the end of the year.</p>
<p>"The President is hoping the Russians will feed into Obama's session on Thursday," a U.S. source told the Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p>In his speech, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad accused Israel of "inhuman policies" in the Palestinian territories and of dominating world political and economic affairs. And, he accused foreign forces of spreading "war, bloodshed, aggression, terror and intimidation" in the Middle East, citing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Gadhafi, addressing the UN for the first time since he took power in a coup 40 years ago, launched into a tirade against the structure of the world body. He charged it is the product of the victorious powers of the Second World War, adding it is "not in the</p>
<p>interest of all nations." However, he said China's presence as a permanent veto-bearing member of the UN Security Council was acceptable. The other permanent members are the United States, Britain, France and Russia.</p>
<p>Gadhafi also said the world currently faces a series of crises, the financial one having been provoked by the "economic capitalist deterioration."</p>
<p>Gadhafi suggested the H1N1 virus -- commonly known as swine flu -- may have been concocted in a laboratory as a military weapon.</p>
<p>He also accused world leaders of being like the speakers in London's Hyde Park, where members of the public traditionally speak their mind, before disappearing into obscurity.</p>
<p>The world leaders address the UN, then also "leave," Gadhafi said.</p>
<p>Libya holds one of the 10 elected seats on the UN Security Council, but Gadhafi said the 15-member body should be called the "terror council."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Appearance of H1N1 virus in schools not unexpected; High absenteeism no reason for alarm, B.C. health officer says</b>
</div><div>Larry Pynn   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>464 words</div><div>24 September 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus has already been detected at three B.C. schools hit by flu, and testing for the virus is underway at another with high absenteeism rates.</p>
<p>But B.C.'s provincial health officer says reports of high absenteeism in schools due to flu-like symptoms are completely expected and no reason for alarm.</p>
<p>"We would anticipate seeing this roll out across the country," Dr. Perry Kendall said Wednesday in an interview.</p>
<p>Kendall said part of the reason for high absenteeism could be parents taking extra precautions and keeping their children home at the first sign of flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"That is good," he said. "I appreciate people acting on the side of safety."</p>
<p>He said the H1N1 virus has been confirmed at Shawnigan Lake School on Vancouver Island, which experienced high absenteeism rates last week. Conditions have improved this week, he said, noting that "the school is managing it very well and there's no panic."</p>
<p>Kendall noted, "There are scores of viruses that can circulate in school children and cause influenza-like illness."</p>
<p>The same health advice applies to all of them: frequent handwashing, coughing or sneezing into a tissue or one's upper sleeve, and staying home when experiencing flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Doug Lawson, superintendent of the Catholic Independent Schools of the Vancouver Archdiocese, said Notre Dame high school in Vancouver learned Monday that one student had tested positive for the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, 70 of 545 Notre Dame students were absent, rising to 100 on Wednesday, although Lawson said it's hard to say how many actually had the flu or were staying home as a precaution.</p>
<p>One student has been confirmed with H1N1 at St. Patrick's high school in Vancouver, but there has been no abnormal absenteeism among the 496 students, Lawson added. "Everyone knew this was going to happen," he said.</p>
<p>Gavin Wilson, spokesman for Vancouver Coastal Health, said tests have been ordered to determine whether H1N1 is responsible for a high absenteeism rate at Elsie Roy elementary school in Yaletown. Health authorities are notified when absenteeism rates exceed 10 per cent.</p>
<p>About 28 per cent of Elsie Roy's 329 students were absent on Monday, rising to 33 per cent on Wednesday. Six of 38 staff also stayed home Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wilson said the symptoms reported among Elsie Roy students were "unusually mild," which could be an important finding if the illness is confirmed to be H1N1.</p>
<p>"It could be an interesting development in the progression of the virus," he said. "It would be good news."</p>
<p>Results of the tests should be known Friday or Monday.</p>

<p>Re: "Parents to blame for fat kids," Editorial, Sept. 18.</p>
<p>I really think that parents are not to blame for obesity. Certain children's obesity is caused by genetic issues and other predisposing medical conditions, rather than just not exercising enough. I do agree with the writer that some of the fault lies with parents who force their children to eat everything on their plates, therefore causing obesity. Some children are not motivated to exercise or participate in team sports. No matter what parents do, they cannot force their children to exercise if they do not want to. I agree that when children are obese, they seem to be down on themselves, therefore having low self-esteem which then can cause suicidal thoughts. Others turn to using drugs to deal with their pain. Obesity has doubled with kids from ages two to 17 in only 31 years. That is a very short time. This has not become a pandemic like the H1N1 virus. Parental influence is only a small factor in child obesity.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Burns remains in game despite failing health; Against enormous odds, former NHL coach says he'll still scout for N.J.</b>
</div><div>Rich Chere   </div>
<div>NEWARK Star-Ledger</div>
<div>562 words</div><div>24 September 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>S07</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Under different circumstances, this could have been his team.</p>
<p>When the New Jersey Devils were searching for a new coach this summer, Pat Burns might have been the logical choice. He is a no-nonsense guy with a Stanley Cup ring, a history of success as a three-time NHL coach of the year and holds a special place in the team's history.</p>
<p>It was, of course, never a possibility. Burns, 57, is dealing with cancer for the third time since he was first diagnosed with colon cancer during the 2004 playoffs. He beat that, as well as liver cancer.</p>
<p>This time it is incurable lung cancer, which has taken a noticeable toll on the once-robust former cop. Burns has lost 57 pounds, and now weighs 184, his voice is very weak and he has decided to forego any further treatment.</p>
<p>"That's all done. It wouldn't do much. It's not going to help. It's a question of time, really," Burns said from his home in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>"I feel so-so. It's a struggle. But we knew that. It's not getting any better. It's progressing."</p>
<p>Usually, Burns soon would be heading to his other home in Florida. He remains a Devils special assignment coach and scout, doing most of his work watching games in Tampa and Sunrise, Fla.</p>
<p>But that is in jeopardy because the risk of the H1N1 Swine Flu virus makes it dangerous for Burns to be around crowds.</p>
<p>He won't get to the Devils' third game of the regular season on Oct. 8 in Tampa, where he usually meets up with the club and general manager Lou Lamoriello.</p>
<p>"I won't be there for the first road game in Tampa. I won't go down to Florida until possibly next month, but the doctors sort of advised me to stay away from crowds because of that H1N1 virus," Burns said.</p>
<p>"I'm going to try to work. I'm going to try and get down to see games in Tampa and Miami like I did last year. As much as I can. I'd like to do a lot more, but I can't."</p>
<p>Burns is an enthusiastic Jacques Lemaire supporter. But he believes, had his health been better, the Devils might have turned to him when Brent Sutter left the team on June 9 with one season remaining on his contract.</p>
<p>"I think so," Burns said. "If I had been healthy I would have loved to coach, but having Jacques back is great for our hockey team. Bringing Jacques back into the picture, I think he's the perfect coach for the situation we're in right now."</p>
<p>It was during the 2004 first-round playoff series against the Philadelphia Flyers when Burns was diagnosed with colon cancer.</p>
<p>He underwent treatment that summer and during the lockout season of 2004-05 with the intention of returning to the Devils' bench.</p>
<p>Liver cancer ended that hope.</p>
<p>He hopes to be strong enough to do some scouting for the Devils once he is inoculated against the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"... You can't just sit around all day or you go crazy."</p>

<p>NEW YORK CITY</p>
<p>Deep in the disjointed ramblings of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi at the UN General Assembly in New York last night lingered germs of good sense. He posited that it would be better held elsewhere than clogged New York and that the permanent members of the Security Council have too much power.</p>
<p>Fair points both.</p>
<p>Yet, unless the struggling interpreters were mistaken, he seemed also to suggest variously that swine flu was manufactured in a secret laboratory as a military weapon or by pharmaceutical companies and that everyone would be better off if Barack Obama were allowed to be American President for ever.</p>
<p>Obama, he said, "was a glimpse in the dark of eight years" -- a reference, of course, to George Bush.</p>
<p>The Libyan strongman monopolised the microphone for more than an hour. For the first 20 minutes, he dipped in and out of a copy of the UN Charter while railing against the Security Council and its alleged disregard for the rights of small countries. He finally tossed the little white book aside.</p>
<p>If he expected an audience of fellow heads of state, he will have been disappointed. The high-level delegations that were seated earlier to hear President Obama speak had filed out in droves, delaying by several minutes Gadhafi actually taking the podium.</p>
<p>Greeted with hostility in New York, Gadhafi did not entirely enjoy giving the speech either. After the first 40 minutes or so, discreet chatting broke out. He begged for quiet.</p>
<p>"All of you are tired and asleep and it's clear that all of you are lacking energy," he said a little crossly.</p>

<p>Veteran NHL goaltender Olaf Kolzig has officially called it quits.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old, who played 14 seasons in the National Hockey League, announced his retirement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"I feel very privileged to have had the opportunity to play the game of hockey at the NHL level for many seasons and I am grateful for everything the game has given me," Kolzig said in a statement.</p>
<p>Kolzig, who was a two-time all-star (1998, 2000), played 711 career NHL games with the Washington Capitals and another eight with the Tampa Bay Lightning. He was traded to Toronto at last year's trade deadline, but he never played a game with the Leafs.</p>
<p>He finished his career with 303 wins, ranking him 21st all-time in goalie wins, along with a 2.71 goals-against average and a .906 save percentage and 35 shutouts.</p>
<p>Kolzig was selected by Washington in the first round (19th overall) in the 1989 entry draft and became the first South African-born player to be drafted in the NHL.</p>
<p>"While I appreciate everything the game has given me and certainly will miss it, I am looking forward to spending more time with my family and remaining involved in hockey in some capacity," Kolzig added.</p>
<p>Kolzig, who also holds German citizenship, represented Germany at the world championships (1997, 2004), the World Cup of Hockey (1996, 2004), and the 2006 Torino Olympics.</p>

<p>Phoenix Coyotes forward Francis Lessard has been suspended for the remainder of the NHL pre-season and three regular-season games for his hit last week on the Anaheim Ducks' Ryan Donally, the NHL announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The incident took place early in the third period of the Coyotes' 5-4 shootout win last Friday. Lessard was assessed a major penalty for boarding and a game misconduct for the hit.</p>
<p>Lessard, 30, was a third-round pick of the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997. In 91 career games in the NHL, he has accumulated 268 minutes in penalties.</p>

<p>Peter Forsberg's latest comeback officially begins today.</p>
<p>The NHL veteran, who has been battling injuries over the past two seasons, will suit up for his hometown Modo team in the Swedish Elite League for a three-game tryout in the next week.</p>
<p>His first test comes at home against Frolunda. He'll then play on Saturday in Stockholm against Djurgarden and Tuesday in Jonkoping against HV 71.</p>
<p>"I really played awfully and I was ready to quit," Forsberg was quoted as saying on the team's website. "But I've felt good recently and I'm ready to go. If I have made six or seven comebacks before, I suppose I can make another one."</p>
<p>The 36-year-old centreman has been with Modo since August and played two pre-season tournament games.</p>
<p>In 706 career NHL games with the Quebec Nordiques, Colorado Avalanche, Philadelphia Flyers and <span class="companylink">Nashville Predators</span>, he has scored 249 goals and 636 assists.</p>
<p>His last NHL action came during the 2007-08 season when he played nine games for the Avalanche, scoring one goal and 13 assists.</p>

<p>Pat Burns, suffering from an incurable form of lung cancer, still plans to scout for the New Jersey Devils this season.</p>
<p>The three-time winner of the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's top coach will scout games in Florida.</p>
<p>"I'm going to try to work. I'm going to try and get down to see games in Tampa and Miami like I did last year. As much as I can," Burns told the Newark Star-Ledger. "I'd like to do a lot more, but I can't. I don't want to be travelling in airports and on airplanes. For me it's tough, because if that gets into my lungs it's going to be a problem. I'll do what I can by car."</p>
<p>Burns will sit out the start of the season until he can get immunized for the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>As for his health, Burns is no longer seeking treatment for the cancer and is resigned to the fact it's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>"I feel so-so. It's a struggle," he told the paper. "But we knew that. It's not getting any better. It's progressing."</p>

<p>The NHL Players' Association's decision to fire Paul Kelly last month has come under increasing criticism in recent days from current and former players. Wednesday, one of the players behind the ouster of the former executive director fired back.</p>
<p>Boston Bruins defenceman Andrew Ference said it wasn't practical to consult all the players about making the decision.</p>
<p>"Guys that say, 'Oh, you need to have everybody vote on something that big,' well, we had five guys voting on hiring (Kelly)," Ference told the Boston Globe. "I didn't hear too many guys complaining about the process of hiring him. We didn't have 740 guys vote on that.</p>
<p>"So it's not something that bothers me because it's the majority of guys who were in that room. I've talked to quite a few of them, and talked to those who work at the PA and former players who are very supportive.</p>
<p>"Obviously some guys are a little louder than others when they give comments, and they get more play. But guys are very comfortable with the decision that we made. We did the right thing. It doesn't make me feel any different from the moment that we had the meetings."</p>

</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus has been detected at several B.C. schools hit by flu, and testing for the virus is underway at another with high absenteeism rates.</p>
<p>But B.C.'s provincial health officer says reports of high absenteeism in schools due to flu-like symptoms are expected and no reason for alarm.</p>
<p>"We would anticipate seeing this roll out across the country," Dr. Perry Kendall said yesterday in an interview.</p>
<p>Kendall said the H1N1 virus has been confirmed at Shawnigan Lake School, which experienced high absenteeism rates last week. Conditions have improved this week, he said.</p>
<p>Doug Lawson, superintendent of the Catholic Independent Schools of the Vancouver Archdiocese, said Notre Dame high school in Vancouver learned Monday that one student had tested positive for the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, 70 of 545 Notre Dame students were absent, rising to 100 yesterday, although Lawson said it's hard to say how many actually had the flu or were staying home as a precaution.</p>
<p>In other flu stories:</p>
<p>- Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty said yesterday that the province will not force H1N1 vaccinations on health care workers. New York state is requiring all hospital and some health and hospice workers to be vaccinated for the usual seasonal flu, as well as the H1N1 variety.</p>
<p>- A survey indicates that many Canadians favour giving government officials permission to restrict personal freedoms in a flu pandemic, with half of those surveyed agreeing that violation of a quarantine order would be tantamount to manslaughter.</p>
<p>The survey, conducted for the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics, was based on a random sample of 600 Canadians surveyed by phone and at town hall meetings between August 2008 and February.</p>
<p>- No patients with confirmed cases of H1N1 "swine flu" remained in hospital on Vancouver Island by late afternoon yesterday, said a spokeswoman for Vancouver Island Health Authority.</p>
<p>H1N1 has been ruled out in the case of an up-Island child listed in critical condition last week after being admitted to hospital with flu-like illness. The child's condition has since improved. An adult also admitted late last week has also been found not to have H1N1.</p>

<p>Ontario will not force H1N1 vaccinations on its health care workers, Premier Dalton McGuinty said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"I don't think we can hold anyone down and inject them with a vaccine if they don't want it," McGuinty said.</p>
<p>Last month, New York state introduced emergency regulations mandating seasonal and swine flu vaccinations for all hospital and some health and hospice workers.</p>
<p>While health officials in New York welcomed the move, unions bristled at it.</p>
<p>In Ontario, one union head threatened "civil disobedience" if a similar program were introduced.</p>
<p>Studies suggest vaccinating all health care workers would cut the transmission of the new flu virus.</p>
<p>In the U.S., an estimated 42 per cent of health care workers get an annual flu shot, only slightly better than the 33 per cent national average, according to U.S. federal health officials.</p>

</p>
<p>The annual summit of the United Nations opened Wednesday with a considered address by U.S. President Barack Obama, and a rambling diatribe from Libyan Leader Moammar Gadhafi .</p>
<p>After Obama pledged America's re-engagement with the world body, the president of the General Assembly introduced the Libyan leader as "king of kings" and "leader of the revolution."</p>
<p>Obama warned all nations have "responsibilities."</p>
<p>"Those who used to chastise America for not acting alone in the world cannot now stand by and wait for America to solve the world's problems," he told world leaders.</p>
<p>"We have sought -- in word and deed -- a new era of engagement with the world. Now is the time for all of us to take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges."</p>
<p>Obama laid out what he said were "four pillars that are fundamental" to America's goals on the world stage, among them world nuclear disarmament, starting with curtailing proliferation of weapons.</p>
<p>In remarks clearly aimed at Iran, which the West suspects is seeking to develop a nuclear bomb, Obama warned there would be "consequences" for any nation that defies the world body's non-proliferation efforts.</p>
<p>"This is not about singling out individual nations; it is about standing up for the rights of all nations that do live up to their responsibilities," he said.</p>
<p>Gadhafi, addressing the UN for the first time since he took power in a coup 40 years ago, launched into a tirade against the structure of the world body.</p>
<p>He charged it is the product of the victorious powers of the Second World War, adding it is "not in the interest of all nations."</p>
<p>Gadhafi also said the world currently faces a series of crises, the financial one having been provoked by the "economic capitalist deterioration."</p>
<p>He also suggested the swine flu may have been concocted in a lab as a military weapon.</p>
<p>Gadhafi's speech began in such a rambling way that many questioned whether he was speaking off-the-cuff.</p>

</p>
<p>Two more patients with H1N1 flu have been admitted to hospital, including a child from the Beecher Bay Indian Reserve, which already has seen one death from the illness.</p>
<p>Shannon Marshall, Vancouver Island Health Authority spokeswoman, said the two cases -- a Victoria-area adult and the child, under six -- were admitted late last week.</p>
<p>As of tomorrow, new hospital cases will be reported weekly on the health authority's website.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, of the two flu-stricken children admitted to hospital last week, one has been sent home, also to Beecher Bay Reserve, 30 kilometres southwest of Victoria. The other child from up-Island, a more serious case, remains in hospital.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, a woman from the Beecher Bay Reserve died in Victoria General Hospital. The woman had aggravating health problems.</p>
<p>She was Vancouver Island's first death from H1N1 and the sixth in B.C. Since the disease reached B.C. in April, after it first appeared in Mexico, the province has reported 50 severe cases.</p>
<p>B.C. public health officials are now taking measures to deal with the pandemic, including distributing anti-viral medicine. They are also expecting federal authorities to deliver an H1N1 vaccine in November.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, after seeing numbers of flu-like illness drop off at Shawnigan Lake School this week, the school might soon relax its containment measures.</p>
<p>Headmaster David Robertson said yesterday that five of the school's 446 students were reporting new flu-like symptoms, down from last Wednesday, when 30 to 40 students were ill.</p>
<p>In all, about 130 students have been reported ill with varying degrees of severity, from fevers to colds.</p>
<p>A test result has now confirmed the presence of H1N1. But Robertson said school officials didn't wait for the confirmation. One student with diabetes, an aggravating health condition, was sent home and containment measures were begun.</p>
<p>That meant Shawnigan Lake School's senior soccer squad missed out on a trip to Victoria last week, where they were to have witnessed basketball star Steve Nash receive an honorary degree from the University of Victoria.</p>
<p>"They were extremely disappointed," said Robertson.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he said, the school is functioning normally. "Our fields are filled with kids doing sports and classes are filled with students."</p>

</div><div>Bruce Cheadle </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Call it the case of the missing mug shots. Despite adamant government claims to the contrary, dozens of photos of Prime Minister Stephen Harper have vanished from the taxpayer-funded website promoting the Tory economic plan.</p>
<p>The photos disappeared after The Canadian Press questioned the government about complaints of partisanship in federal advertising.</p>
<p>"We have not removed any pictures of the PM," a Privy Council Office spokesperson insisted late Monday.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the prime minister made the same assertion.</p>
<p>After being presented with a cached image of the www.actionplan.gc.ca[http://www.actionplan.gc.ca] site from last week that featured more than 40 photos of Harper, the government did not respond to further inquiries. The website now features about seven Harper photos.</p>
<p>The Canadian Press reported Monday that the Tories are spending at least $34 million on promoting their economic action plan, but only a fraction of that on informing Canadians about the coming H1N1 flu season. The government's economic ads, including a new $5-million TV buy, all link to actionplan.gc.ca.</p>
<p>"People see it as an abuse of tax dollars," Gerry Nicholls, a former Harper colleague at the National Citizens' Coalition, said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Rules on government ads say all communications must be strictly non-partisan. However, the website makes numerous references to the "Harper government." Repeated inquiries to the Privy Council Office have not yielded an explanation of how the site follows the rules.</p>

</p>
<p>Regina's emergency service workers have the armour to fight H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The region's paramedics and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) have been fitted with N95 respirator masks -- which provide greater respiratory protection than surgical masks, said Cory Brossart, manager of EMS operations with the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region.</p>
<p>EMTs and paramedics wear surgical masks unless they perform procedures such as administering asthma medications through a nebulizer -- which can result in a fine mist.</p>
<p>"That's where you need to have the N95 protection, because that mask will filter it," Brossart said.</p>
<p>EMS staff have taken occupational health and safety training to reinforce how to properly wear the N95 masks, goggles, gowns and gloves. Increasingly, employees are focusing on infection control.</p>
<p>"It includes an enormous amount of handwashing just to make sure that we don't cross-contaminate with any patient," Brossart said. "It's the simple hygiene things that are going to keep everybody safe from this."</p>
<p>If patients can tolerate it, they, too, will wear surgical masks.</p>
<p>When the second wave of the H1N1 virus hits, the region plans to replace sick paramedics and EMTs with management personnel and health-care workers from throughout the region who could be deployed to a hard-hit area.</p>
<p>Since members of the Regina Fire Department are first-responders to medical calls, all firefighters have been fit tested with the N95 masks and trained over the summer.</p>
<p>"Gowns, gloves and goggles are provided, too, on the trucks," said Layne Jackson, the department's deputy of public safety, planning and prevention. "It's not just for the pandemic. It's when they respond to medical calls and there's reason to believe there is an aerosol hazard, or if there is a communicable disease hazard."</p>
<p>To cope with staff shortages, "fire trucks and firefighters will be strategically redeployed around the city to protect high-hazard areas that we've identified," Jackson said.</p>
<p>Seven people with the Regina Police Service have been trained to be mask-fit testers and members will be fitted for the N95 masks next month, said Alissa Sullivan, its EFAP health and safety co-ordinator.</p>
<p>"We'll also be commencing training for all employees starting on Friday, on what H1N1 is, tips for prevention at work and at home," she said.</p>
<p>The RPS is prepared for 40 per cent of staff to be off sick for about eight weeks.</p>
<p>"Only services labelled essential will continue to be provided so scheduled major events will be cancelled or postponed," Sullivan said.</p>
<p>The RCMP has sent information packages to members and their families about the signs of the H1N1 virus, how it's contracted and how to prevent it, said Sgt. Carole Raymond.</p>
<p>In addition, kits with materials for handwashing, masks, gloves and gowns are being distributed for use in detachments and police cruisers.</p>
<p>"If there is anyone sick in our care, we will ask the prisoner to wear a mask so they don't get other prisoners sick," Raymond said.</p>
<p>She said plans to shore up detachments hard hit by flu include asking members from neighbouring detachments to help out.</p>
<p>"If it became provincial, we'd deploy from other provinces," Raymond said. "We've got lots of resources."</p>

<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1064 words</div><div>23 September 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>E1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>Infinera Inc., a California optical system house, has hired a top Nortel optical engineer to lead a new research operation in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Kuang-Tsan Wu led a team that helped make Nortel a force in high-speed 40-gigabit and 100-gigabit technology, where the company has numerous deals for trials with customers. But with Nortel's time rapidly running out, many of its engineers are not waiting around for the end.</p>
<p>Several companies are believed to be hiring, including the Ottawa office of <span class="companylink">Huawei Technologies</span>, the booming China communication maker that passed Nortel as the world's second-biggest optical equipment supplier last year and briefly supplanted leader <span class="companylink">Alcatel-Lucent</span> early this year.</p>
<p>Huawei has been hiring engineers from Nortel and other companies since it opened here a year ago. The operation is now well above the 32 employees disclosed earlier this year.</p>
<p>Infinera's immediate plans are more modest. Founded in 2001 to develop digital optical system gear, Infinera plans to hire a handful of other development staff for its Ottawa centre.</p>
<p>With major customers including Level 3 in the U.S. and Colt Networks in Britain, it says it has been the biggest long-haul optical networking player in North American markets for two years. But it has been taking its lumps in the recession. Sales of $135.5 million in the first six months were 55 per cent lower than a year earlier. It lost $51 million, compared to a profit of $74 million a year earlier. The stock plunged in July after an analyst said Infinera may have lost a Level 3 deal to Huawei.</p>
<p>Companies</p>
<p><span class="companylink">CounterPath Corp</span>., a Vancouver communication technology firm with Ottawa staff, said sales fell 18 per cent to $2.1 million in the first quarter ending in August.</p>
<p>But deep personnel cuts at the former NewHeights, FirstHand and Bridgeport operation reduced losses by 80 per cent to $1.2 million compared to a year ago. The company said Genesys, a call-centre software company, and two North American service providers are buying or testing its technology. Tech magnate Terence Matthews is a major shareholder.</p>
<p>Jennerex Inc. said the Ottawa Regional Cancer Foundation is a new investor in a fresh financing round that generated $5.6 million U.S. Jennerex said the ORCF investment made it a significant partner but did not disclose precise details. Based in San Francisco, Jennerex has research operations in Ottawa developing JX-594, a potential treatment for liver, lung and colorectal cancers. It has raised $25 million in venture capital and $10 million in grants and other funding. It expanded to Ottawa in 2006 to a research operation led by Dr. John Bell of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute/University of Ottawa.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Rockwell Collins</span>, an Iowa-based aircraft electronics company with an Ottawa presence, trimmed profit forecasts for the full year by six per cent because of pension, merit pay and restructuring costs in shutting a San Jose operation. It predicted that government clients will drive sales growth of 12 per cent in the next fiscal year, twice the growth rate of a commercial aircraft business.</p>
<p>Guardian Mobility said the Iraqi Air Force is paying $1.3 million U.S. to expand tracking capabilities on its fleet of 125 helicopters and aircraft. Guardian, a five-year-old company, has grown to 20 Ottawa employees developing and selling GPS tracking devices.</p>
<p>Variation Biotechnologies, an Ottawa company developing vaccines, said it is getting promising results from a new influenza vaccine aimed at H1N1. It said the VariositeTM vaccine dramatically reduced viruses and the magnitude and duration of fevers in animal tests. The research, funded by the federal government, is taking place at the National Research Council labs in Ottawa and the Armand Frappier Institute in Montreal. Founded in 2001 to develop intelligent vaccines that respond to changing diseases, Variation landed $35.7 million U.S. from U.S. venture capitalists in early 2007.</p>
<p>Two Ottawa companies grabbed two of the five best-of-show product awards at the 4G World wireless trade show in Chicago. DragonWave's Horizon Quantum packet solution won the Best 4G Enabling Technology award and Bridgewater won the best mobile internet application for the myPolicy product for iPhone and Blackberry clients.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Harman International</span> said it will produce navigation, music and infotainment systems for the new Mercedes Benz S- and C-class vehicles and for new <span class="companylink">BMW</span> vehicles. Harman's QNX Software of Ottawa provides the operating systems.</p>
<p>People</p>
<p>Nortel Networks has appointed Clarke Glaspell as controller at an annual salary of $250,000 and a bonus of up to 60 per cent. He succeeds Paul Karr, who is resigning effective Oct. 9. Glaspell joined Nortel in 2000.</p>
<p>OSI Geospatial said Peter Hunter has resigned as chief financial officer. John Sentjens, vice-president of finance, is the acting CFO.</p>
<p>Harry Rozakis is the new chief executive officer of Cyrium Technologies, an Ottawa solar energy technology company.</p>
<p>PlantCML, a public safety communications technology company with Gatineau operations, has appointed Darrin Reilly as chief operating officer. Formerly with IPC-Positron and <span class="companylink">Motorola</span>, he will be based at PlantCML's headquarters in Temecula, Calif.</p>
<p>Gesturetek said <span class="companylink">Sony Ericsson</span> is using its gesture control technology in the new Yari mobile phone.

<p>Canada's doctors are preparing to launch a full-court press to urge pregnant women in Canada to get the H1N1 flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Special posters, fact sheets and mail-outs will be sent to all maternity health-care providers across Canada, including hospitals, clinics and doctors' offices, promoting immunization of pregnant women and advance prescriptions for the antiviral drug Tamiflu that could be filled at the first sign of symptoms.</p>
<p>"The message is very clear: first and foremost, immunization," said Dr. Vyta Senikas, a vice-president of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.</p>
<p>A special task force involving 15 partnering organizations met in Toronto this week to discuss a national effort to advise pregnant women about the risks of H1N1.</p>
<p>Senikas said the posters will feature the logos of the country's major maternity-care organizations to show the public they are working together to address the high-risk nature of pregnant women catching the flu.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the president of the society has written to doctors across the country, recommending they immunize women coming for regular prenatal visits wherever possible.</p>
<p>Dr. Michel Fortier said pregnant women in the third trimester or at term are one of the groups most at risk to be affected by H1N1.</p>
<p>Pregnant women who catch the virus are more likely to face complications such as pneumonia and severe respiratory distress. Severe complications can lead to early delivery or miscarriage, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>But Fortier said there is "great concern" about the historically low level of flu shots among the demographic. It's estimated that fewer than 20 per cent of pregnant women get a seasonal flu shot.</p>
<p>"Pregnant women are reluctant to use any medication or take any immunizations," Senikas said. "They're always worried about side-effects."</p>

</div><div>Mark Lepage   </div>
<div>FREELANCE</div>
<div>521 words</div><div>23 September 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>D5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>He crawls among us.</p>
<p>He spits, shrieks, stomps, writhes, dry-humps, bitches about his swine flu, professes undying love and yes, even walks among us. He is Manson, and he is not dead yet.</p>
<p>Two nights after Metallica shook - and packed - the Bell Centre, Marilyn Manson brought 4,000-plus into the rink's theatre setup, proving anti-heroism is trumped by thrash virtuosity. But let it be said - obviously suffering from something we hope isn't really swine flu, the devil had some good lines.</p>
<p>As red stage lighting was greeted with a sincere volley of devil horns from the faithful, cue the eerie. Wearing moonboots and a jacket bearing the words HELL, ETC., Manson emerged in front of a massive Star Spangled backdrop, fell to his knees and - what's the opposite of praying?</p>
<p>We're From America was the greeting, followed by the flu talk. "So if I spit in your mouth - I'm sorry." Anyway, he'd "filled my body with enough drugs and alcohol to make germs afraid." It may not have been sex, but it was certainly unsafe. And Disposable Teens set off the pit for the first heaving of the evening.</p>
<p>And we saw the importance of being Manson. Self-pity, self-loathing, vengeance, the canny bursts of enraged intelligence - who else is bringing this in rock culture right now? What fun we've had since 1996's Antichrist Superstar, with someone who can articulate and incarnate all the ugliness of a culture that's been on an epic meth-run of violence and shame.</p>
<p>And Manson felt the emotion coming back. After a scabbed howl through Pretty As a Swastika, he told the Montreal crowd he loved it. He seemed to mean it. He fooled around, draping himself in an American (boos) and then a Canadian flag (louder boos). "What flag do you want?"</p>
<p>He brought them theatre - with all its pauses, setups, minor costume changes, staggered pacing, brain-stun guitars from Twiggy Ramirez, new songs (Four Rusted Horses), old ones (Fall of Adam, Dried Up, Tied and Dead to the World, we think), a touch of self-laceration on a guitar, the occasional promise of danger, and Tuesday night catharsis.</p>
<p>After Leave A Scar, he found a top hat for Dope Show and plunged into the melee, spreading the sweat, phlegm and blood. Poor Twiggy. He got a big flu-ridden hug for Rock Is Dead. So count yourselves lucky. And get your shots.</p>
<p>The church candles in Sweet Dreams, a scabrous</p>
<p>attack on something that might have been Rock'n'Roll Nigger, and then the clever dolorous Beatles lick leading into the finale. In this ramshackle yet somehow winning performance, here we had the Manson in full: half diva, half suicide, all undead. Long may he prey.</p>

<p>NASCAR</p>
<p>Penske crew chief only allowed to visit race shop for meetings</p>
<p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Kurt Busch said it was business as usual Tuesday, the only day of the week his crew chief is allowed inside the race shop. Penske Racing has asked Pat Tryson to only visit the race shop during the weekly competition meeting because he's leaving at the end of the season, and the team does not want him part of 2010 planning. Tryson is moving to Michael Waltrip Racing at the end of the year. The practice of excluding a departing team member is fairly common in NASCAR, but the Tryson situation is interesting because Busch is a championship contender. He heads into the second round of the Chase for the championship fifth in the Sprint Cup standings. "I don't see it bringing up any issues," Busch said Tuesday. "The fact of him still being there on race weekends and being the leader will definitely keep the continuity together Friday, Saturday and Sunday. With him just showing up on Tuesdays: "Crew guys are off on Monday, so everybody's off Mondays. Tuesday, he was there this morning. We had the driver debrief, and business was as usual. It felt great." Still, he said the departure is a "tough situation."</p>

<p>Top-ranked Gators lose six more players with flu-like symptoms</p>
<p>GAINESVILLE, Fla. - No. 1 Florida kept six more players out of practice because they had flu-like symptoms. Gators coach Urban Meyer says starting linebacker A.J. Jones was among those feeling ill. No player has had a confirmed case of swine flu, but Meyer is concerned the virus could ravage the defending national champs. Receivers coach Billy Gonzales, who was sent home the day before because of a fever, was at practice, wearing gloves and mask. Also missing were defensive back Josh Evans, receiver Justin Williams, offensive lineman Shawn Schmieder, running back Mike Gillislee, and defensive end Earl Okine.</p>
<p>RUGBY</p>
<p>Teen player banned for 20 years for assault during match</p>
<p>SYDNEY - A 16-year-old boy has received a 20-year ban from playing rugby league after attacking an opponent during a western Sydney junior grand final match. The Blacktown City player's attack in the weekend match left a fellow 16-year-old player on the Lower Mountains team with a broken nose and suspected eye fracture. Two other Blacktown City players were suspended for five years and another received a two-year ban following a judiciary hearing of the Penrith Junior Rugby League. The bans apply to rugby league anywhere in Australia. Footage of the match shows several Blacktown City players chasing down rival players, then punching and kicking them. Parents are seen giving high-five congratulations to Blacktown players as they left the field after the match. Police were examining video footage Wednesday and said assault charges were being considered. The Blacktown Advocate newspaper said the assault was the third incident involving players or supporters of the club this season. Two men were charged following an assault after an under-12 game in July and a supporter allegedly grabbed a 13-year-old around the neck.</p>

In a joint memo issued in the past two weeks by Goodell and the NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith, players were reminded thatthey will continue to be tested as in the past and that "a positive test will generally result in a suspension."</p>

<p>Flu deaths due to heart disease</p>
<p>Heart patients who catch the flu may have more to worry about than just a fever or the sniffles.</p>
<p>Research shows the virus could also trigger a heart attack.</p>
<p>Experts say it's crucial that heart patients get vaccinated against both regular flu and swine flu to avoid medical problems.</p>
<p>Doctors say swine flu isn't more dangerous than regular flu, but it's important for heart patients to get vaccinated because more flu viruses will be circulating this year.</p>
<p>British researchers analyzed 39 previous studies of heart patients and found a consistent link between flu and heart attacks.</p>

<p>Statistics Canada reports the number of births rose in all age groups, particularly among mothers aged 30 to 34.</p>
<p>The agency says the total fertility rate, or the average number of children per woman, increased to 1.66 in 2007 from 1.59 in 2006.</p>
<p>While this was the highest total fertility rate since 1992, Statistics Canada says it remained well below replacement level of 2.1 children per woman.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pandemic fear: unqualified teacher subs - Number may rise if virus hits hard</b>
</div><div>By Nick Martin   </div>
<div>673 words</div><div>23 September 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Women and men unqualified as teachers are substituting in classrooms in rural Manitoba each year because there are not enough certified substitute teachers available locally.</p>
<p>And there could be many more unqualified "substitute teachers" in classrooms this year if an H1N1 pandemic strikes.</p>
<p>It's been the practice, primarily in rural and remote areas, for years, and it's far better to have non-teachers in a classroom than to send kids home, says Education Minister Peter Bjornson.</p>
<p>The unqualified substitutes are only to be hired as a last resort. There are stringent provincial policies that limit their use and require school divisions to seek people with higher education and experience working with children.</p>
<p>Still, the woman or man at the front of the class this morning might not be a qualified, certified teacher. There were 269 non-teachers who worked more than 20 days each in classrooms across Manitoba in 2008-2009 -- almost all in rural Manitoba where qualified substitute teachers weren't available. City divisions obtained a few permits for scarce vocational or French immersion specialists who were still working to get their academic credentials.</p>
<p>If the non-teachers work more than five days straight or, as of this year, more than 10 days total within a division in a school year -- down from 20 days previously -- the division must apply for a department of education permit approving that person for more extensive classroom duties.</p>
<p>"There are provisions in place that allow this," said Bjornson, who pointed out that it is "very, very rare" to have unqualified people at the front of a classroom for more than a day or two at a time.</p>
<p>What educational knowledge students get out of the days with unqualified adults "would depend on the individual that takes the class," the minister said.</p>
<p>The Manitoba Teachers' Society is adamant that a certified teacher should be in the classroom, president Pat Isaak said.</p>
<p>"Limited teaching permits should only be issued when the division has proven they've exhausted all of their efforts to find certified teachers," Isaak said.</p>
<p>"Last year, we used unqualified subs," Lakeshore School Division superintendent Janet Martell said from Eriksdale. "We do that every year. This is in dire straits."</p>
<p>Last year, Lakeshore used nine unqualified substitutes, seven of them for a total of two to four days each, and two of them for longer than 20 days apiece.</p>
<p>Lakeshore is advertising for unqualified subs, who must go through police background checks, and other rural divisions are also compiling lists of available unqualified subs, Martell said.</p>
<p>"Part of our urgency is around pandemic planning," Martell said. "It's been a heightened conversation because of the pandemic planning."</p>
<p>Bjornson would not speculate how many unqualified people might be needed in a flu pandemic, but said: "It's prudent for them to be planning."</p>
<p>With the flu expected to hit, "We're looking at all our volunteers, our unqualified substitutes, our parents," Martell said. "In rural Manitoba, we don't have a lot of people that can fill the bill if the worst-case scenario happens."</p>
<p>Teachers who are off sick usually leave detailed lesson plans, she pointed out.</p>
<p>nick.martin@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Non-teachers in class</p>
<p>MANITOBA school divisions that requested in 2008-09 to have a non-teacher work more than 20 days, when no certified teacher was available as a substitute:</p>
<p>Border Land, Division Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine, Flin Flon, Frontier, Garden Valley, Hanover, Kelsey, Lakeshore, Louis Riel, Mountain View, Mystery Lake, Pembina Trails, Prairie Spirit, Red River Valley, River East Transcona, Seine River, Seven Oaks, St. James-Assiniboia, Sunrise, Turtle Mountain and Turtle River. City divisions say they have no substitute-teacher shortage and only request such permits to hire senior high vocational staff with specialized trade skills unavailable among certified teachers and who have not yet obtained teaching credentials, or faculty of education grads specializing in French immersion who are awaiting certification.</p>

<p>The recent announcement by Vancouver Island Health Authority of a cut in MRI examinations appears to contradict the government's promise of an increase in medical services funding of six per cent per year.</p>
<p>In fact, this underlines the fiscal realities of modern medicine. Advances in medical sciences are increasing exponentially.</p>
<p>I will give one of hundreds of possible examples. And I will preface this by saying that medical advances do not save lives, but they do defer death -- and that deferral can be very expensive.</p>
<p>In 1966, a patient with leukemia would almost certainly die within a year. End of story. End of cost.</p>
<p>Since 1987 this patient could be offered a bone marrow transplant.</p>
<p>The transplant itself is, of course, expensive because it has to be preceded with no end of investigations and procedures.</p>
<p>In all subsequent years he or she will require office visits with a family physician, twice a year visits with a local haematologist and once a year visits with a haemopathologist in Vancouver.</p>
<p>The transplant is not always completely compatible, and this slight incompatibility will lead to ocular problems requiring visits with an ophthalmologist and troublesome skin problems requiring a dermatologist.</p>
<p>Sometimes the immune system never quite gets up to par, and every one or two months the patient might need an expensive infusion of antibodies. Bone marrow transplant also leads to an increased incidence of cataracts, diabetes, thyroid disorder and kidney problems with their attendant costs.</p>
<p>So I have some degree of sympathy with the provincial government when medicare is rapidly becoming the major draw on diminishing provincial revenues. Since this is the reality it is essential every penny be spent wisely.</p>
<p>From my point of view in family medicine, this is not the case.</p>
<p>Recently I noted that a local walk-in clinic had closed prematurely because the attending physician had seen the maximum number of patients for which he would be paid in the one shift. Based on the arithmetic and a four-hour shift, the number of patients seen would have been 50.</p>
<p>That is less than four minutes and 48 seconds for the physician to take a current and past history, make an examination, discuss the findings, decide on treatment, prepare a prescription, outline future treatment plans and make a written record.</p>
<p>It cannot be done.</p>
<p>Most of these patients will end up with a subsequent visit to their family physician or another walk-in clinic -- at the cost of another office visit.</p>
<p>This is not good medicine, nor is it good value for the taxpayer's money. It is a very expensive $1,500 Band-Aid.</p>
<p>I have been reading an official information bulletin to physicians concerning the imminent epidemic of H1N1 influenza. This pandemic has the potential of completely overwhelming the system functionally and financially.</p>
<p>One of the principal suggestions is "Ensuring rapid access to telephone consultation and clinical evaluation for these (high risk) patients as well as patients who report severe illness."</p>
<p>How much better that the patients be able to speak to their own family physicians, who have access to complete medical records and knowledge of their general health status.</p>
<p>This would also serve the important purpose of keeping a potentially infectious person isolated from the community.</p>
<p>This service can no longer be provided free by the physician, and the fee need not be excessive. (Fifty per cent of the regular office fee was suggested by an arbitrator in 2001.)</p>
<p>The telephone time will probably take one or two hours a day, maybe even more.</p>
<p>The knowledge and the responsibility involved has a value -- and the cost to the physician of rent and staff will continue during this time.</p>
<p>This would save the cost of a visit to a walk-in clinic or physician's office.</p>
<p>I suggest that the provincial government overcome their long-standing prejudice against paying for telephone consultations -- if only temporarily during this potential crisis.</p>
<p>With safeguards (such as restricting the service to existing patient/physician relationships) this would be a cost-effective and public-health-smart way of dealing with the impending calamity -- making the most of every health-care dollar.</p>

<p>Two more patients with H1N1 flu have been admitted to hospital, including a child from the Beecher Bay Indian Reserve, which already has seen one death from the illness.</p>
<p>The two new cases -- a Victoria-area adult and the child, under six -- were admitted late last week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, of the two flu-stricken children admitted to hospital last week, one has been sent home, also to Beecher Bay Reserve, 30 kilometres southwest of Victoria.</p>
<p>The other child from up-Island, a more serious case, remains in hos-pital.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, a woman from the Beecher Bay Reserve died in Victoria General Hospital. She had aggravating health problems. The woman was Vancouver Island's first death from H1N1 and the sixth in B.C.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canada wants a carbon copy of U.S. policy</b>
</div><div>The StarPhoenix</div>

<p>He may lead the country that's the second largest by land-mass and is one of the planet's highest emitters of carbon per capita, but that doesn't mean Prime Minister Stephen Harper doesn't have a clear and forceful stance on climate change.</p>
<p>Figuratively pointing to U.S. President Barack Obama, whose own stance is ambiguous, Mr. Harper's message is: "What he said."</p>
<p>There was a time when what Canada said on environmental issues mattered. There was a Montreal protocol attached to the Vienna Convention for the protection of the ozone layer, drafted to tackle ozone depletion caused by pollutants such as chlorofluorocarbons.</p>
<p>And it was Canadian leaders who pushed early on for a global discussion on what to do about the threat of climate change that scientists predict will dramatically change the world unless carbon pollutants are curtailed.</p>
<p>But this week, as world leaders gather in New York to discuss, among other things, the need for a plan on how to curtail carbon emissions, Canada not only is silent but proud to go along with what the United States thinks is right.</p>
<p>To be fair to the prime minister, whose office was scrambling Monday to remove dozens of Mr. Harper's photos from federal websites after news reports indicated Ottawa had spent $34 million of taxpayers' money to promote actions the "Harper government" has taken to combat the economic crisis, but only $2 million or so to tell Canadians how to protect themselves from an imminent H1N1 epidemic, Mr. Obama continues to register higher in the polls in Canada than any national politician. So agreeing to go along with the U.S. might be politically expedient.</p>
<p>Of course, neither the PM nor the rest of the country will know if that is the case until Congress and the White House draft a carbon policy for Canada.</p>
<p>To be sure, there is some logic to the suggestion that, on the single North American continent where the Canadian and U.S. economies are distinctly integrated, a co-operative and concerted plan to deal with the environment is crucial. This is precisely how Canada and the U.S. dealt with the acid rain issue in the 1980s.</p>
<p>But typically such an agreed-upon course comes through negotiation, rather than have a major partner -- the one responsible for a greater share on a per capita basis in emitting carbon -- waiting in the anteroom until the big guy makes up his mind.</p>
<p>And it was clear from Mr. Obama's statements Tuesday that the U.S. is still a long way from deciding. There were hints that by the time the policy is finalized in Washington, there will be the devil to pay. There was no indication, however, on who will make that payment.</p>
<p>"The journey is hard," Mr. Obama told the summit convened by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. "And we don't have much time left to make it."</p>
<p>That doesn't mean, however, the U.S. has placed at the top of its agenda this hard and perilous journey. Top of the list for the U.S. administration is reforming America's backward health-care system. And at least here, Canada is on the agenda.</p>
<p>Mostly, however, that involves the talking heads on right-wing media taking ill-informed cheap shots at Canada's single-payer medicare system, and health-care advocates promising they won't introduce anything so bad in the U.S.</p>
<p>Given the bruising Canada's reputation has been taking over the last few years every time it makes an appearance overseas, perhaps it's wise for Mr. Harper to curtail any comments on climate change he might make to his seatmates at an intimate dinner of 100 special guests invited by the UN Secretary-General. As Mom used to say, if you don't have something good to say, it's best to stay nothing at all.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate, however, that given the scope of this issue, the entire Canadian government was unable to offer something to the world as had been Canada's tradition.</p>
<p>It could have offered, for example, to help establish a compulsory fund, based on the size of a nation's GDP, to help developing nations deal with the impact of climate change. Or Canada could have been on the forefront of a global initiative to quickly transfer low-carbon technology to rapidly growing economies as a way to help them continue to grow while mitigating the environmental impacts of that growth.</p>
<p>Apparently, however, this wasn't part of the U.S. plan. So Canada has chosen instead to sit quietly and wait until it's told what to do.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu vaccine rekindles questions over autism link</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>489 words</div><div>22 September 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>B8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>
</p>
<p>The much-anticipated H1N1 vaccine has given new life to an ongoing debate about whether vaccinations in children can cause autism, a discussion that will likely heat up as Canada and other countries move closer to releasing the new vaccine.</p>
<p>From one side of the debate come assurances that vaccines are safe and there is no conclusive link to autism; from the other, warnings that there is a relationship and parents should think twice about giving shots to their children.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, has repeatedly said that vaccines have a long history of being safe and effective. Weighing in on the autism debate, he noted in a recent interview with Canwest News Service that vaccines are given to children at around the same age as when neurological disorders can surface.</p>
<p>"You can have a close time frame," he said. "Just because something's associated in time does not mean it's causal."</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said he recognizes that parents are searching for answers about autism's cause, but added claims that vaccines are the culprit have not been proven.</p>
<p>"The studies have been pretty clear and consistent that vaccination is not the cause of many of the things that have been claimed around the vaccine," he said.</p>
<p>The benefits of immunization far outweigh the risks, said Butler-Jones, but he understands people need to think carefully about it.</p>
<p>"It's important that they get the facts -- not the theory, not the conjecture, not the claims -- but the actual facts about what we know about the vaccine and the disease and I think. . . virtually everybody would choose the vaccine," he said.</p>
<p>The theory that childhood vaccines are behind an upsurge of autism cases emerged in the 1990s and in recent years has gained high-profile advocates such as Hollywood star Jenny McCarthy, whose son was diagnosed with autism. McCarthy is among the people who believe children receive too many vaccines, too close together, and that a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal used in some vaccines is harmful.</p>
<p>Harold Doherty, a New Brunswick parent who writes a blog about his son's experience with autism, says his opinion on the controversy lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>"While I once accepted without questioning the public health authorities' position that there is no vaccine-autism connection, I am no longer so sure," he posted in one entry. In an interview, he told Canwest News Service that not enough research has been done for him to accept or reject the theory.</p>
<p>Thimerosal has been removed from most of the vaccines given to children, but it is contained in influenza shots, including the new H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Public health officials have said the vaccine will be ready in early November and children age six months to five years are among those who should get it first.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>The government of Canada website set up to promote the Conservative economic action plan had a slightly different look Monday: more than 30 photos of Prime Minister Stephen Harper had been removed.</p>
<p>Critics have complained that the website, actionplan.gc.ca, looks like a partisan promotion - complete with a Tory-blue colour scheme, glowing third-party testimonials, more than 40 photos of Harper and repeated references to "the Harper government" rather than the Government of Canada.</p>
<p>A Canadian Press story Sunday highlighted the $34-million budget of the government's action plan promotion, which dwarfs the budget provided for informing Canadians about H1N1 flu prevention as the flu season starts.</p>
<p>Non-partisan public service ads on preventing the H1N1 virus from spreading - created by Ontario's Health Ministry - began airing across the country Monday, with the Public Health Agency of Canada picking up the related $2 million tab.</p>
<p>The latest TV ads promoting the government's stimulus package cost $5 million, and include Conservative-friendly tag lines such as "we can't stop now." But it is the action plan website, to which TV viewers are directed, that has drawn the most criticism because of its overt boosterism.</p>
<p>Rules on government advertising say it must be non-partisan and not promote any party or individual.</p>
<p>There are also strict Treasury Board rules on government branding, including using the word Canada in any department or agency name, or including Government of Canada.</p>
<p>References to the "Harper government" remained on the website Monday. However only about seven photos of the prime minister remained from the 40-plus available on the weekend.</p>
<p>Sunday night, a Privy Council Office spokesperson defended the Harper photos on the action plan website writing, "The Prime Minister is the chief spokesperson in the Government of Canada for the (action plan)."</p>

<p>Last week we asked:</p>
<p>How has the H1N1 virus threat made you change your habits?</p>
<p>I didn't change my habits at all. The only thing I do is wash my hands better. I pay more attention to information on H1N1.</p>
<p>Joëlle Longpré ,</p>
<p>Secondary 2,</p>
<p>École Secondaire</p>
<p>Jean-Baptiste-Meilleur</p>
<p>It changed my habits because now I wash my hands more often. I go away when people sneeze or cough.</p>
<p>Gabriel Garceau,</p>
<p>Secondary 2,</p>
<p>École Secondaire</p>
<p>Jean-Baptiste-Meilleur</p>
<p>The peril of the H1N1 virus made me change my habits tremendously. I started washing my hands more often, especially before eating. I also began to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer to clean my hands after touching books, papers, etc. Moreover, if ever I cough or sneeze into a tissue, I make sure to deposit it in a trash can immediately, instead of placing it on any surface that others might touch.</p>
<p>Jessica Palmieri,</p>
<p>Secondary 5,</p>
<p>John F. Kennedy High School</p>
<p>The threat of the H1N1 virus has made me more aware of how important the simple task of hand washing is and its effectiveness. In school, we used to only wash our hands after going to the washroom and before eating. Now, we must remember to wash our hands when we enter the school, between classes, after going to the washroom, before and after lunch, and lastly when exiting the school. We must also not forget that the threat of the H1N1 virus is not only in schools but it is everywhere.</p>
<p>Isabella Trivisonno,</p>
<p>Grade 10,</p>
<p>John F. Kennedy High School</p>
<p>They talk a lot about H1N1 and how important it is to wash your hands often and to have hand sanitizer, but I'm still not going to wash my hands every five minutes. I will wash my hands more often and I do have a hand sanitizer. If people would listen to everything the media says to do, we would be washing our hands and sanitizing our hands all day long.</p>
<p>Jessica Fredette,</p>
<p>Secondary 2</p>
<p>Chambly Academy</p>
<p>I haven't thought a lot about the H1N1 virus but I have heard many people talk about it. It is very important to know about it so we can be cautious. Even before the H1N1 virus, I have always kept hand sanitizer in my bag.</p>

</p>
<p>It is critically important that all levels of government communicate with us as fully as possible. We need to know about new government programs, changes to taxation, emerging public health issues and numerous other things that impact our lives.</p>
<p>Part of that need for communication rests in the fact that we must have complete information in order to access what governments provide for us. But we also need to know how our tax money is being spent at the local, provincial and federal level.</p>
<p>We all know nothing is free in this world. So it likely comes as no surprise to most of us that taxpayers foot the bill for our governments communicating with us. But it is completely inappropriate for our money to be spent on what amounts to partisan political campaigning, thinly disguised as public communication from government. It doesn't matter which party is doing it. It is disrespectful to taxpayers because it assumes we're not smart enough to notice. And it is simply wrong -- and wasteful -- to spend our money in this way.</p>
<p>The Stephen Harper government is spending millions of dollars promoting its economic plan, including touting the home improvement tax credit that's available in this taxation year. Certainly the more people who are aware of that tax credit, the more impact it will have economically. So publicizing it is a good idea.</p>
<p>But the TV ads about stimulus spending refer repeatedly to the "Harper government" and refer people to a website resplendent in Tory blue with numerous photos of Harper. This is not your basic public service announcement.</p>
<p>Even more galling is the fact the Conservative government is spending about $34 million on the media blitz promoting the budget. The Public Health Agency of Canada has a total marketing budget of $6.5 million to tell Canadians about H1N1 flu. Talk about skewed priorities.</p>
<p>The Dalton McGuinty government should learn from the bad example set by the federal Tories. The Liberals plan an advertising blitz this fall aimed at convincing Ontarians the controversial Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) is a matter of "tax fairness." The ad campaign comes as a byelection win in Toronto's St. Paul's riding last week boosted the Liberals' confidence. It's difficult to see how an HST ad campaign could be anything but partisan with a provincial election approaching in about two years. If that's the case, the McGuinty team must ensure taxpayers don't get stuck with the bill. If taxpayers are to pay, the ad campaign must avoid the partisan leanings that mar the federal advertising campaign.</p>
<p>Most Canadians are neither naive nor stupid. Most us don't begrudge our tax money paying for programs and services. But if we want to support a political party, we'll make our own donations, thank you very much.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ignatieff calls for spending cuts; Liberal leader says action must be taken to bring deficit under control</b>
</div><div>James Cowan   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>513 words</div><div>22 September 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Michael Ignatieff accused Conservatives Monday of making a "mess" of the country's finances, saying it is now impossible to tell what spending cuts are needed to eliminate the projected $56-billion deficit.</p>
<p>The Liberal leader said his party would cut government expenditures in a bid to rebalance the budget. But he offered no specifics about possible cuts, saying the Conservatives' "wishful projections" make it difficult to determine the deficit's size. "Upon taking office, we'll conduct a full audit of our public finances. We'll open the books and find out where we really are," he said to the Toronto Board of Trade. "That's Step 1."</p>
<p>The current government has repeatedly hiked the projected size of the deficit for the current fiscal year, from $36 billion in January's budget to $50 billion in May to $56 billion this month. "I can't tell you if it will be $60 billion at Christmas," Ignatieff said after the speech.</p>
<p>Ignatieff also said his party would pour money into programs aimed at stimulating the economy. A Liberal government would fund job training programs, help manufacturers buy new equipment and provide additional support for high-tech sectors, he said. There would also be increased funding for public transit, roads, water systems, bridges and Internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Liberal plan stands in contrast with the vision put forward by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, according to Ignatieff.</p>
<p>"Our proposition to Canadians is that you can't get growth unless government leads. Mr. Harper's proposition is 'just let it happen; it will all work out in the end.' Well, it won't all work out in the end unless you have a government that invests strategically," he said.</p>
<p>While offering few details, Ignatieff did rule out funding the new programs with tax hikes.</p>
<p>"At a time when we're still bumping along the bottom, tax increases would add to the burden on Canadian businesses and Canadian families. We think that might shut recovery off cold. So our proposition is we need to keep our tax rates competitive, but we will not propose tax increases in the next election."</p>
<p>The Liberal caucus announced earlier this month that it would no longer support the Conservatives in the House of Commons and would actively begin pushing for the government's downfall and an ensuing election. Harper's government survived a non-confidence vote last week with the support of the NDP and Bloc Quebecois. The Liberals intend to table another confidence motion early next month.</p>
<p>Revelations that the Conservative government plans on spending $34 million to promote its economic action plan, but only $6.5 million on public awareness campaigns to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus, demonstrate why Liberals can no longer support the government, Ignatieff said.</p>

</p>
<p>We squeezed as much as we could out of summer these last few weeks, but at 5: 18 p.m. today, it will officially come to an end.</p>
<p>Today is the autumnal equinox, the first day of fall, when the length of day roughly equals the night.</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow - and for the next six months - there will be more darkness than light.</p>
<p>It's one of two times during the year when the sun is directly over the earth's equator. As well, the amount of daylight is changing at the fastest rate.</p>
<p>We're losing four minutes of light every day, said John Percy, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Toronto. "For some of us, we can actually detect that in our sleep patterns."</p>
<p>But it's not all bleak.</p>
<p>Of course, there are the fall colours, pumpkin pie, hockey season and Halloween to look forward to.</p>
<p>What's more, one of the country's leading weather experts says we can expect the unseasonably warm temperatures we have enjoyed of late to continue a little while longer.</p>
<p>"It may be the first part of fall will be the summer we never had," said David Phillips, senior climatologist at Environment Canada.</p>
<p>The long-term seasonal outlook suggests warmer than normal temperatures, with less precipitation, Phillips said.</p>
<p>"People won't be down to muscle shirts and tank tops, but it will be warmer than you'd expect for this time of year."</p>
<p>It doesn't mean we won't get a frost before Halloween, or a light snow before Remembrance Day, Phillips said, but overall, temperatures should be slightly warmer.</p>
<p>The Old Farmer's Almanac, on the other hand, says temperatures will be cooler this season.</p>
<p>Perhaps the stars and planets can provide some insight.</p>
<p>Toronto-based astrologer Julie Simmons says several "distinct astrological pictures" show tremendous uncertainty for the upcoming season. "There's a lot of emotional anxiety about what to believe," she said. "Is the economy better or isn't it? Are we all going to die of swine flu or aren't we?"</p>
<p>Our collective anxiety will be relieved at some point in November, Simmons said, when the "incredible tension" between Saturn and Uranus will come to a head, causing an event that will give us "more of a handle on what reality might be."</p>
<p>While we wait for Saturn and Uranus to work things out, Simmons said we should embrace our inner Libra and be particularly mindful of our personal relationships.</p>
<p>"The autumn equinox basically reminds us that we have to live together if we're going to live through the winter."</p>

</p>
<p>A report that the federal government is spending five times as much on touting its economic plans as on educating the public about H1N1 is disturbing, if unsurprising.</p>
<p>The British have been bombarded since the spring with a highly effective “Catch it, Bin it, Kill it” mass advertising campaign by their Department of Health. Radio, TV and full-page advertisements in newspapers have been warning people to practise good hygiene by washing hands frequently and using tissue to cover their noses and mouths. The ads are effective because they are so graphic, focusing on the nasal mucus expelled by a sneeze. One critic complained the ads make sneezing seem like one of the grossest things anyone could do. But in the context of the spread of a potentially fatal flu, that's not much of a stretch. There are even ads targeting children, featuring “Dirty Bertie” and his “revolting habits.”</p>
<p>It may not be a coincidence that Britain has just announced a dramatic decline in swine-flu cases, leaving the country “tantalizingly close” to winning its battle against the pandemic, according to its chief medical officer. In Canada, in contrast, with the Public Health Agency's $6.5-million budget a fraction of the $34-million multimedia onslaught celebrating the government's efforts to fight the recession, advertising has been low-key, the production values low, the message stultifying. There's no catchy slogan. In Britain they get “Catch it, Bin it, Kill it.” In Canada, we get “Know what to do to fight the H1N1 flu virus (Human swine flu)/Savez-vous quoi faire contre le virus H1N1 (grippe porcine chez l'être humain).” There's no mucus either. It is less a marketing campaign than a dour public service announcement.</p>
<p>The tardiness of the government's educational efforts to stop the spread of H1N1 is surprising. Radio ads have only just appeared, TV ads are promised as imminent. But the timing may matter less than the ads' failure on purely marketing terms. As conceived, the ads will not likely change anyone's habits, and hence any money spent on them is probably wasted anyway. But the government's decision to limit spending on H1N1 education is not an example of fiscal prudence.</p>
<p>Boasting about the government's management of the economy during the recession has an obvious political payback. There are no votes to be had from educational campaigns about public health matters. That could change, however, if Canada's relatively lackadaisical approach to swine-flu prevention is shown to have contributed to a serious outbreak.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Two flu shots for tots, but just one for adults and older children; Trial shows vaccine supply may be sufficient</b>

</p>
<p>Multiple vaccines. Multiple tear-filled encounters with a needle.</p>
<p>Parents of children under the age of 10 could face an eventful influenza schedule this year, as the first U.S. trial of swine flu vaccine in kids shows the youngest will require two H1N1 shots, on top of as many as two seasonal flu doses.</p>
<p>But there's good news for children 10 and over: They appear to need just one dose of the pandemic vaccine.</p>
<p>The findings, released yesterday by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, come as countries prepare to administer the H1N1 vaccine and worry that global supplies of the drug may be limited.</p>
<p>The results for older children, along with earlier studies showing that healthy adults will also need just one dose, means that there could be enough of the new drug to go around.</p>
<p>Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID, said the H1N1 vaccine is “strikingly similar” to the seasonal flu shot. With seasonal flu, young children who have never received a shot must receive two doses to be adequately protected.</p>
<p>“The initial results are encouraging. As we had hoped in children, the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine is acting just like the seasonal flu vaccine,” Dr. Fauci said yesterday.</p>
<p>The trial in the U.S. involved unadjuvanted vaccine – one without a chemical booster. Canada plans to use a smaller amount of vaccine with an adjuvant, which increases production. As a result, it remains unclear whether the U.S. dosage regime will work in Canada.</p>
<p>The country has ordered 50 million doses from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>. The vaccine will be rolled out in mid-November at the latest.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada said the U.S. data will be used in evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. The agency said GSK's clinical trials, using the adjuvanted vaccine that Canada has ordered, will, in time, show whether one or two doses is required in children.</p>
<p>The U.S. study involved 600 subjects between the ages of six months and 17 years.</p>
<p>Researchers found that 76 per cent of those aged 10 and older who received a single shot had a strong enough immune response, after eight to 10 days, to assume they would be protected.</p>
<p>Only 25 to 36 per cent of the younger age groups had a strong response, indicating that they need a second shot. The two doses would be 21 days apart.</p>
<p>Young children didn't respond well after one dose because they have had less exposure to influenza and their immune systems are not as strong as those of adults, Dr. Fauci explained.</p>
<p>Anne Matlow, director of infection prevention and control at the Hospital for Sick Children, said parents may be reluctant to see their children receive multiple shots. But this virus has disproportionately affected younger people, unlike seasonal flu that mainly burdens the elderly.</p>
<p>“I'm a big advocate of vaccines,” Dr. Matlow said. “If you can prevent something, why would you not want to?”</p>

</p>
<p>SURGICAL masks and hand-sanitizer</p>
<p>units are flying off some</p>
<p>store shelves as local businesses</p>
<p>and consumers gear up for a possible</p>
<p>H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for several local medical</p>
<p>supplies stores said sales have</p>
<p>started ramping up again after slowing</p>
<p>down over the summer.</p>
<p>Rick Stephens, manager of the Stevens</p>
<p>Home Medical Supplies Store in</p>
<p>Health Sciences Centre, said the store</p>
<p>couldn't keep up with the demand</p>
<p>for masks and hand sanitizers when</p>
<p>H1N1 first appeared last winter. And</p>
<p>now the same thing is happening as</p>
<p>the autumn flu season approaches.</p>
<p>"We were right out of the masks</p>
<p>until we got a new shipment in this</p>
<p>morning," Stephens said. "And we've</p>
<p>had a lot of requests for the hand-sanitizer</p>
<p>units from both consumers and</p>
<p>businesses."</p>
<p>The president of the store's parent</p>
<p>company -- Brampton-based Stevens</p>
<p>Company Limited -- said sales of flurelated</p>
<p>safety products are up dramatically</p>
<p>right across the country,</p>
<p>including in Manitoba.</p>
<p>Jeff Stevens said his family-owned</p>
<p>firm is one of the largest medical</p>
<p>supplies distributors in the country,</p>
<p>with warehouses in five cities supplying</p>
<p>products directly to businesses,</p>
<p>health-care facilities, government</p>
<p>agencies, and medical supplies retailers.</p>
<p>Its network of retail stores sells to</p>
<p>both businesses and consumers.</p>
<p>Stevens said orders from business</p>
<p>clients are 75 to 100 per cent higher</p>
<p>than they were before H1N1 hit the</p>
<p>headlines. Government orders are up</p>
<p>about 50 per cent, and orders from</p>
<p>health-care clients are running 25 to</p>
<p>30 per cent higher than normal.</p>
<p>"It's not unusual to see corporate</p>
<p>orders amounting to two or three hundred</p>
<p>thousand dollars," he said, adding</p>
<p>he's worried there could be shortages</p>
<p>if demand increases too much.</p>
<p>The kinds of products Stevens Co.</p>
<p>Ltd. sells include surgical and respirator</p>
<p>masks, hand-sanitizer dispensers,</p>
<p>hard-surface disinfectants, disposable</p>
<p>isolation gowns, goggles and</p>
<p>non-latex gloves.</p>
<p>Stephens said the hand-sanitizer</p>
<p>units are the hottest sellers at the</p>
<p>company's Winnipeg retail store. Consumers</p>
<p>are buying a lot of the desktop</p>
<p>and pocket-sized sanitizers, while</p>
<p>businesses are not only snapping</p>
<p>up those, but also the wall-mounted</p>
<p>units that are popping up in buildings</p>
<p>all over the city, including grocery</p>
<p>stores, hotels, medical offices, shopping</p>
<p>malls and hospitals.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for two of the city's largest</p>
<p>employers -- Great-West Life Assurance</p>
<p>Company and <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span></p>
<p>-- confirmed they've purchased</p>
<p>hand sanitizers for their staff.</p>
<p>Marlene Klassen said Great-West</p>
<p>Life isn't buying masks for its workers</p>
<p>because the Public Health Agency</p>
<p>of Canada says they aren't effective in</p>
<p>preventing the spread of flu viruses</p>
<p>because people use them incorrectly</p>
<p>or contaminate themselves when putting</p>
<p>them on or taking them off.</p>
<p>A spokesman for a local organization</p>
<p>that specializes in emergencymanagement</p>
<p>and business continuity</p>
<p>planning -- Disaster Recovery Information</p>
<p>Exchange -- said masks may</p>
<p>not be an effective tool for some businesses</p>
<p>but they can be for others.</p>
<p>That's why it's important for companies</p>
<p>to determine what would work</p>
<p>best in their situation before buying a</p>
<p>bunch of medical supplies, said Brock</p>
<p>Holowachuk, president of DRIE's central</p>
<p>region.</p>
<p>Holowachuk said the same rule applies</p>
<p>when determining what kind of</p>
<p>contingency plans they'll need in case</p>
<p>a large number of workers get the flu</p>
<p>at the same time. DRIE is offering</p>
<p>information sessions and a one-day</p>
<p>workshop to help businesses prepare</p>
<p>pandemic plans.</p>
<p>"What we're trying to do is give</p>
<p>people the tools to do something about</p>
<p>it," Holowachuk said.</p>

<p>shopping list</p>
<p>Medical supplies are flying off the</p>
<p>shelves as the winter flu season approaches</p>
<p>and concerns mount about</p>
<p>a possible H1N1 flu outbreak. Here's</p>
<p>what local medical supplies retailers</p>
<p>say about the situation:</p>
<p>WHO'S BUYING THEM?</p>
<p>Individual consumers, businesses,</p>
<p>government agencies, daycare centres,</p>
<p>personal care homes, hospitals,</p>
<p>medical offices and even some</p>
<p>churches.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE THEY BUYING?</p>
<p>In the case of consumers, it's mostly</p>
<p>surgical masks and hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>That includes both the desk-top units</p>
<p>and the pocket-sized units.</p>
<p>In the case of businesses, it's also</p>
<p>mainly masks and hand sanitizers,</p>
<p>including the desk-top, pocket-sized</p>
<p>and wall-mounted units. Some types</p>
<p>of businesses where employees</p>
<p>have close contact with customers,</p>
<p>such as medical clinics and dentist</p>
<p>offices, are also stocking up on nonlatex</p>
<p>gloves, disposable gowns and</p>
<p>eye goggles.</p>
<p>In the case of governments, the</p>
<p>Manitoba government has been</p>
<p>stockpiling all of those things, plus</p>
<p>antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu and</p>
<p>Relenza. The government is stockpiling</p>
<p>the items for the health-care</p>
<p>sector in case supplies run out.</p>
<p>A spokesperson said it has enough</p>
<p>on hand to cover an eight-week disruption</p>
<p>in supply. That includes:</p>
<p>. 2.2 million N-95 respirator masks</p>
<p>. 28.3 million surgical masks</p>
<p>. 1.9 million disposable isolation</p>
<p>gowns</p>
<p>. 2 million disposable eye-protection</p>
<p>lenses and 1 million reusable eyeprotection</p>
<p>frames</p>
<p>. 730,000 examination gowns</p>
<p>. 13,500 litres of hand sanitizer</p>
<p>. 176,000 treatment courses of</p>
<p>Tamiflu, an antiviral drug used to</p>
<p>treat symptoms of the flu</p>
<p>. 56,000 treatment courses of the</p>

<div id="hd"><b>What if flu strikes charities, closes food banks, shelters? -</b>
</div><div>By Marcel Lauzière   </div>

</p>
<p>I have been getting a lot of blank looks lately. And long pauses over the phone. It happens when I start talking about the potential impact of the influenza pandemic on Canada's charitable and nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>If I focused on hospitals, schools, business or government, I would be joining a lively and useful public debate about how prepared we are, and how prepared we should be, for a major outbreak. But charities and non-profits are too often not part of the discussion.</p>
<p>My question is: How prepared are we to meet this potential threat to the ability of charities and non-profit organizations to deliver critical services?</p>
<p>Many of our most vulnerable Canadians depend on charitable and non-profits operating in communities, large and small. Many of these organizations rely on a small number of staff and some, on only a loyal and dedicated band of volunteers. If the H1N1 virus hits Canada hard, can services be maintained if these organizations lose up to a third of their staff or volunteers to illness?</p>
<p>What if food banks start closing -- how will desperate families feed their kids? What if meals are no longer prepared and delivered to elderly people who can't get out and who have no one to help them? What about Canadians needing dialysis or chemotherapy but who can't get to the hospital because there are no volunteers to drive them? What about the thousands of children and their families who rely on local sports and recreation and arts and cultural organizations for their activities? What if the homeless shelters shut their doors in the middle of winter?</p>
<p>Canada has one of the largest charitable and non-profit sectors in the world. Perhaps because it is so diverse, the sector is generally underestimated. Charities and non-profits provide critical social, family and community services, often in concert with government. Among their many other activities, they help build our quality of life through sport and recreation, arts and culture, health, educational, environmental and philanthropic pursuits. They are the third pillar of Canadian society alongside governments and business</p>
<p>These organizations are part of an intricate system of societal supports that make us a country that actually works, despite our many economic and social challenges. Without them, those challenges would be much worse and the quality of life of all Canadians would be profoundly diminished. Take charities and non-profits out of the equation and we would not have the Canada that we value.</p>
<p>They are also a significant part of our economy. The sector generates more than $87 billion annually, a contribution of almost seven per cent to Canada's GDP. It employs more than 1.5 million Canadians (full-time equivalents) and mobilizes 12.5 million volunteers in Canada.</p>
<p>The importance of business continuity during an outbreak is being addressed. Major corporations are putting plans in place and the Public Health Agency of Canada recently announced funding for the International Centre for Infectious Diseases to help small- and medium-sized businesses prepare for a potential outbreak. That makes sense. Everyone wants our economy to keep working.</p>
<p>Charities and non-profits are part of our economy, too, as well as being major contributors to our quality of life. In the event of an outbreak of H1N1, so many of them will be on the front lines supporting and caring for Canadians of all ages and all backgrounds in every community. The demand many of them face is already greater given the impact of the recession and now they must prepare for the possibility of an H1N1 outbreak. What if they are not adequately prepared? We will need them more than ever at a time of crisis. This is no time for blank looks. As a country, we need to figure out how we can help them be prepared for whatever this influenza season brings.</p>

<p>The Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion is recruiting volunteers in Windsor and Essex County this week for an H1N1 virus study. Volunteers between the ages of 18 and 29 and those 65 or older are being encouraged to sign up. The study is not limited to those who have been ill with the virus -- anyone can participate.</p>
<p>The study will attempt to determine how much of the population has already been exposed to the virus since the outbreak began this spring by looking for antibodies in blood samples that would indicate a person has some protection against H1N1 and is less likely to become infected again. The OAHPP is also hoping to pinpoint the risk factors for H1N1 infection and estimate how many people could catch the virus.</p>
<p>Dr. Natasha Crowcroft, OAHPP's director of surveillance and epidemiology, said the Windsor-Essex portion of the provincewide H1N1 study was only recently introduced, after the local health unit organized labs where participants' blood samples can be taken. But those wishing to be part of the study only have until Thursday to enrol.</p>
<p>All volunteers will be given their test results, Crowcroft said.</p>

<p>China kicked off mass vaccinations for swine flu on Monday in Beijing, making it apparently the first nation in the world to start innoculating its population against the virus.</p>
<p>The Asian giant has been at the forefront of international efforts to produce an H1N1 influenza vaccine, with at least five companies receiving government approval for the work. However, officials have warned demand will exceed supply.</p>
<p>Authorities kicked off the program by immunizing students due to take part in next week's National Day celebrations. About 100,000 students are due to attend, according to recent state media reports.</p>
<p>"We believe that China is the first country in the world to start mass vaccinations for H1N1 flu," said Vivian Tan, spokeswoman for the World Health Organization in China.</p>
<p>The Health Ministry has said it plans to vaccinate 65 million people, or five per cent of the country's total population of 1.3 billion, before year's end.</p>
<p>In Washington, officials said younger children will need two doses of the vaccine against the new pandemic of H1N1 influenza,.</p>
<p>They said tests of Sanofi-Pasteur's swine-lu vaccine showed children respond to it just as they do to seasonal flu vaccines, with children over 10 needing only a single dose.</p>
<p>Separately, Sanofi said it had won a U.S. government order for 27.3 million more doses of its vaccine based on the lower dose requirement.</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said young children will likely need to have their doses 21 days apart. But he said they could receive seasonal flu shots and H1N1 shots on the same day.</p>

<p>Canada's preparation for the expected outbreak of the H1N1 has Conservative party values written all over it.</p>
<p>The flu pandemic is expected to hit aboriginal communities hardest, especially in remote areas, so it makes sense to focus primary prevention and treatment efforts there.</p>
<p>But due to the government's propensity for looking at the world through "white-coloured glasses," it seemingly has decided that the best prevention/treatment options include reducing First Nations people's access to hand sanitizers containing alcohol, and shipping stacks of crisp, new body bags to remote reserves.</p>
<p>Nothing screams "Conservative values" more than Canada's current pandemic prevention plan. I guess that the next logical step would be to send H1N1 carriers throughout First Nation communities to get the party started, like was done in the 1800s with smallpox. After all, it would be a pity to waste all those new body bags.</p>

<p>The latest government move in sending body bags to northern Manitoba reserves shows how much value Ottawa places on First Nations people's lives.</p>
<p>The government withheld alcohol-based gel for germ killing because someone thought they might drink it. This was a bad move by a government which refuses to sign the UN declaration on indigenous rights.</p>
<p>The latest is a racist move because body bags were not sent to city hall in Winnipeg or Brandon as a preparedness gesture, but were sent only to reserves. The kits that were to be an H1N1 preventive measure is nothing more than a way to count the dead.</p>
<p>This happened before in Canadian history, which people like to forget. There were several smallpox outbreaks isolated to reserves in the past, due to contaminated blankets sent as another way to prepare for the sickness.</p>
<p>When the government that is supposed to protect you sends you body bags, you know it has already written your life off as too costly to save. If this is not an insult, send a body bag with all soldiers so they are prepared for harm that comes to them while protecting this country.</p>
<p>Because this happened to First Nations it's not a reason to dismiss it. The whole Health Department needs to be examined for racism to weed out bureaucrats who deem First Nations as disposable. Aboriginal people deserve more respect than they have received.</p>

</p>
<p>A bevy of local agencies held a barbecue in Saskatoon's inner-city area Saturday in hopes of informing people how to be prepared for an outbreak of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"Folks in this area don't have access to the World Wide Web," Saskatoon Public Schools spokesperson Joy Adams Bauer said as a crowd outside the White Buffalo Youth Lodge snacked on hot dogs and potato chips. "They're not necessarily listening to the radio -- all those traditional communication channels."</p>
<p>As people arrived for the free food -- courtesy of the Prince Albert Grand Council -- volunteers from the Saskatoon Health Region, the Red Cross, the school divisions and the city mingled with the crowd, showing them how to use hand sanitizer when soap and water aren't available.</p>
<p>"Washing hands is probably one of the most key health prevention strategies to do for flu preparedness," city emergency measures co-ordinator Ray Unrau said. "It's really important to be vigilant on that, especially before the (H1N1) vaccine's available."</p>
<p>Attendees were also directed to tables full of pamphlets, which included information on proper hand-washing and hand-sanitizing techniques, good hygiene practices while sick and guides instructing families about how to prepare for emergency situations.</p>
<p>How worried people are about a resurgence of H1N1 come the fall flu season depends who you ask.</p>
<p>"I'm not worried about it at all," Saskatoon resident Melvin Geddes said. "The Black Plague came. AIDS came."</p>
<p>He said he felt well-informed about infection control measures before Saturday's barbecue, because he's received pamphlets and listened to the news.</p>
<p>Julian McKay, on the other hand, says he's "very worried" about H1N1 "because it's a pandemic."</p>
<p>"I don't like diseases and viruses," he added, coughing into his elbow.</p>
<p>When asked how useful Saturday's barbecue was in preparing him for a flu outbreak, McKay said, "Is that what this is for?"</p>
<p>Unrau says that kind of response exemplifies why organizations are holding events such as the free lunch.</p>
<p>"This population is at as much of a risk as anyone else," Unrau said. "We need to think of creative ways to get them together and discuss what the flu is all about."</p>
<p>Adams Bauer said organizers took some precautions when gathering on the cusp of what could be a viral outbreak. Hand sanitizer was plentiful and all the servers were wearing gloves, she said. Also, the event was held outside, rather than confined to a small space.</p>
<p>Unrau said the irony of holding a gathering to discuss the prevention of spreading infection did occur to organizers.</p>
<p>"Right now, the flu illness rates were so low, we didn't think it was as much of a risk as it was a benefit," he said.</p>
<p>Saturday's event was organized by the health region, the public and Catholic school divisions, Saskatoon Fire and Protective Services, MD Ambulance, Quint Development Corp., the Salvation Army, Egadz Youth Centre, the Red Cross, AIDS Saskatoon, the Ministry of Social Services, the Indian and Metis Friendship Centre, the Saskatoon Housing Authority, the Saskatoon Food Bank and Learning Centre, the Central Urban Metis Federation Inc., White Buffalo Youth Lodge and the Prince Albert Grand Council.</p>

</div><div>Theresa Boyle </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>

</p>
<p>At the security desk outside the entrance to the emergency department at Toronto East General Hospital, patients are greeted by a goggled, gowned and masked intake nurse. This is a makeshift screening station for swine flu, where the hospital hopes to catch any potential cases before the bug can spread to other patients and to staff.</p>
<p>Patients are asked a series of questions: Have they had a fever? A cough? Any shortness of breath? Have they travelled? If they fail the screening test, they are handed a mask and sent to the hospital's new "cough room," an isolation room in the ER for patients with potentially infectious respiratory viruses.</p>
<p>The hospital opened the screening station last spring in response to the H1N1 influenza virus, but the cough room opened back in January, a project that was on the books since the 2003 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.</p>
<p>"Every day we screen patients and every day we find a few patients who fail the criteria for one reason or another," explains microbiologist Dr. Jim Downey, the hospital's infection control officer.</p>
<p>"The fact we have seen so much this summer is probably an indicator that we are going to see a lot more this fall, and potentially with more severe illness," he says, adding that it is unusual to have so much influenza in the summer.</p>
<p>All Ontario hospitals are getting set for the next wave of swine flu, with plans to screen patients at entrances, provide separate waiting rooms, stock up on hand sanitizers, masks, gloves and gowns, and encourage staff to get a flu shot.</p>
<p>Downey insists Toronto East General is ready for the dreaded second wave thanks to pandemic planning measures implemented after SARS.</p>
<p>Justice Archie Campbell, who led a commission that investigated the SARS response, found a lack of preventative measures against infectious disease and hospital workers who were inadequately protected.</p>
<p>The outbreak had a particularly devastating impact on Toronto. The 44 Canadian deaths from SARS occurred in the Toronto area.</p>
<p>"SARS was a real eye-opening experience for us. The responses that we have made have really been from SARS. We wanted to make sure we were better prepared for a serious illness like a pandemic," Downey explains.</p>
<p>Since H1N1 first emerged last April, it has claimed more than 2,800 lives worldwide. In the northern hemisphere, the infection rate dropped over the summer, but is expected to jump this fall.</p>
<p>Toronto East General has screened ER patients for respiratory illnesses since SARS, but ramped up efforts after the H1N1 outbreak hit. Before H1N1, screening was done as part of the triage process at the intake desk inside the ER. Now it's done at the entryway, catching people before they enter.</p>
<p>As well, all new hospital employees are fitted for respiratory masks during their orientation. They are refitted every two years.</p>
<p>"My mask is a 3M9210," says hospital president Rob Devitt.</p>
<p>Having the ability to move quickly is half the battle in preparing for a pandemic, he explains.</p>
<p>"I'd hate to be scrambling and doing all of this stuff at the last minute and realizing suddenly that supplies may not be available or that staff haven't been properly kept up to date on personal protective equipment," Devitt says.</p>
<p>Keeping staff safe is another priority. The casualties of SARS included two nurses and a doctor. Even if H1N1 causes only mild illness in most people, it can put pressure on intensive care units and ERs.</p>
<p>"If half your staff is sick, you're in real trouble," Downey says.</p>
<p>For that reason, a third of the province's hospitals, including most of those in the Greater Toronto Area, have purchased antiviral medication for staff. Hospitals can break open the stockpile if the outbreak gets worse, to keep employees from getting sick.</p>
<p>It was an expensive decision, one that cost downtown's University Health Network alone $1 million.</p>
<p>While naysayers contend the world is overreacting to H1N1, Devitt argues that it would be foolhardy to be unprepared.</p>
<p>"We, as leaders, have to think of H1N1 far more broadly than just H1N1. It's important in pandemic planning to think broadly because you don't know what the shape of a pandemic will be," he says.</p>
<p>While the hospital has done extensive planning, officials concede the response hasn't rolled out perfectly. Take, for example, the open education forums it held to keep staff updated on what's happening with the virus around the world. They were held in the hospital's lecture theatre, which holds up to 200 employees.</p>
<p>"Afterward ... we thought, you know, this is something that's passed on person to person. It's out in the community. We're bringing all these people together in a big room. Aren't we actually creating a theoretical medium for H1N1 to spread?" Devitt recounts.</p>
<p>So the hospital began videotaping updates and putting them on the hospital's intranet.</p>
<p>"To those who would argue that this is too much, I would say it's just good planning," Devitt says.</p>
<p>"Our mantra is 'Plan for the worst but hope for the best.' I think we are very, very prepared."</p>

<p>Every family should have an emergency supply kit -- 72 hours worth of food and water -- and a preparation plan should a natural disaster happen, says Canadian Red Cross disaster management co-ordinator Debra Peterson.</p>
<p>Peterson was one of a number of resource people attending the first annual Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' disaster preparedness exposition on Saturday.</p>
<p>"It is very important for people be prepared in case of a disaster. In Saskatchewan we don't have a lot of disasters, but the more you are prepared the less effect a disaster will have on you and the quicker you will recover if a disaster occurs,'' Peterson said. "Emergency people will be here and on hand (if a disaster should hit the city) but unfortunately they can't help everybody at the same time.</p>
<p>"So the responsibility is on each individual and family to be prepared so they can help themselves.''</p>
<p>John Knight, chairman of the "Be Prepared" Fair, said while government agencies oversee disaster relief program, it's important that individuals take some responsibility for their own well-being.</p>
<p>It's important that families have survival kits prepared in the event they are evacuated from their homes at a moment's notice or a financial plan in place should they lose their job, Knight said.</p>
<p>If the inaugural fair, which consisted of seminars on financial and estate planning, basic first aid training, and numerous exhibits providing information on everything from preserving your own food to creating your own emergency survival kits to preparing for an H1N1 pandemic, is successful, Knight said it will become an annual event.</p>
<p>"We tried to cover as many areas as we could,'' Knight said, explaining they had a lot of help from agencies such as the city's fire and police services, the Red Cross and Salvation Army.</p>
<p>Bouncing her nine-month-old son on her knee, Nena Hawkes, said when she and her husband got married three years ago they began stockpiling food supplies in the event of a disaster, which provides a measure of security and comfort.</p>
<p>"We tend to read a lot about food storage and things like that, but I think it is equally if not more important to be financially prepared,'' Hawkes said.</p>
<p>"We never really looked at having a will until our son was born. Just knowing that our family will be cared for and provisions will be made for them is really important.''</p>

<p>Brenda Robinson makes it her business -- literally -- to prepare for a pandemic influenza outbreak.</p>
<p>The occupational health nurse moved to Regina from Toronto a year ago in April when she got married. She recently set up Paragon Occupational Health Consulting -- a business that helps local companies understand and prepare for an influenza outbreak.</p>
<p>"I have been involved in occupational health since 1986," Robinson said. "I'm a registered nurse and I have worked for many kinds of industries -- from manufacturing to pulp and paper to the food industries, working with cities and with the Toronto Police Service."</p>
<p>Robinson was on the City of Toronto's police service's bioterrorism and nuclear response committees and the police's pandemic planning committee. During the SARS epidemic, she worked at Toronto's emergency operations centre 16 hours a day.</p>
<p>"We were responsible for the safety of all of the emergency services workers and for making sure that our people were going into situations that were safe," Robinson said.</p>
<p>She recalled the centre's keyboards, desks and computer monitors were cleaned every 20 minutes to ensure the heads of essential services stayed healthy.</p>
<p>Now this 58-year-old hopes to put her experience to work for Regina's small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>"I can assist them in understanding what the pandemic is, because there's a lot of misunderstanding out there and how it could affect their businesses and their employees," she said.</p>
<p>She believes myths surround the pandemic because, since March, the public has been inundated with H1N1 pandemic information and before that warnings about the avian flu.</p>
<p>"It may be a little bit of overkill," Robinson said. "They're hearing about it, but they don't know anybody who has been severely affected so (they think) 'it's not going to affect us.' This wave of H1N1 may not, but there is likely something else coming down the pike that could be more severe. That's what puts everyone's business into a tailspin."</p>
<p>To keep a company's supply chain going, she said it's important employees receive accurate information quickly to safeguard their health.</p>
<p>"One of the major issues that we found during the SARS epidemic was the communication," Robinson said.</p>
<p>"You didn't know which information was accurate. Stories were coming out from all over the place and you didn't know where to turn for up-to-date and accurate information."</p>
<p>To prevent the spread of the virus, business owners must determine what needs to be done at the workplace and what can be done from home.</p>
<p>"What are they going to do if all of their key players are sick? How are you going to keep your business running? What's your plan?"</p>
<p>Robinson said she can help an employer develop contingency plans that range from setting up handwashing stations throughout the business to advising them on the proper use and disposal of masks.</p>
<p>"If we get to the point where people have to come to work wearing masks, making sure that they're wearing the right kind, that they're wearing them correctly, that they're handling them correctly and they're disposing of them correctly."</p>
<p>Robinson can be contacted by phone at 502-1607.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu plans need a federal enforcer: experts; Provincial strategies ineffective unless somebody wields a 'big stick'</b>
</div><div>Joanne Laucius </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>668 words</div><div>21 September 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>Without a "big stick" to hold over the provinces, the federal government's pandemic response plans could fail, an expert on population health warned during a panel on H1N1 swine flu at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>"As good as co-operation is, when the carrot fails, you need the stick," Amir Attaran, a professor of both medicine and law, said last week.</p>
<p>When there is a major health issue like SARS or the listeria outbreak, one level of government points fingers at the other. It's especially a problem when the response has to be agile, said Attaran, who holds the Canada Research Chair in law, population health and global development policy at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>"If there is a breakdown, someone has to hold the big stick. That's what's missing in Canada right now," he said. "Aspects of the pandemic plan are good on paper; but when it comes to the operational level, there can be troublesome gaps."</p>
<p>Attaran points out, for example, that when the World Health Organization was seeking timely information about SARS transmission in Toronto during the 2003 outbreak, Health Canada had to turn the questions over to Queen's Park.</p>
<p>"There is still no law under which Ontario could be told, 'You give us that information or someone goes to jail.' "</p>
<p>Attaran was one of three speakers on Thursday's panel who spoke about the need for federal power to bridge gaps in the system.</p>
<p>In an editorial last month, the Canadian Medical Association Journal called for a flu "czar" to lead the response to the H1N1 pandemic. The czar would have executive powers across all jurisdictions and would be "ultimately accountable to the highest office in the country," the editorial said.</p>
<p>"We need a better-co-ordinated plan," said Dr. Paul Hébert, a critical-care physician at The Ottawa Hospital and an epidemiology researcher who was one of the authors of the CMAJ editorial.</p>
<p>The next wave of H1N1 has already hit the West Coast, said Hébert, who fears the pandemic could tax capacity in intensive-care units. This flu has proven to be unusual in that it hits a few people very hard.</p>
<p>"Our plans are very good. But they're organized around a public-health perspective. It's turning out to be an ICU problem," Hébert said. He questions whether there would be enough ventilators or medical staff to handle a surge in patients.</p>
<p>In Canada, ICUs are already at 98- to 100-per-cent capacity, he said. If H1N1 cases end up in ICUs, it might create problems. Meanwhile, Kumanan Wilson, a medical professor and Canada research chair in public health policy, said while vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of H1N1, many people won't be willing to take it -- and a change to the law might help.</p>
<p>He said some people are hesitant to be vaccinated for fear they will have to fight through the court system for compensation if they suffer serious side-effects. Compensation programs exist in the U.S. and most of the G8 countries, as well as in Quebec, but not the rest of Canada, he said.</p>
<p>"You don't want that in the forefront or even in the background of people's minds. You want people to respond to the emergency," he said. "It's a case where our laws are very, very backward."</p>
<p>Attaran said the best way to persuade more people to get vaccinated for the good of all would be to challenge the leaders of political parties to get vaccinated publicly. It worked in Africa when leaders stepped forward to help public-health authorities trying to encourage people get tested for AIDS, he said.</p>
<p>"I would like to see every MP line up and roll up their sleeves."</p>

</p>
<p>KANDAHAR, AFGHANISTAN -- Medical staff at the Kandahar Air Field fear the pandemic influenza has infiltrated the base where Canadian soldiers are stationed in south Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The illness, which has spread to most countries of the world and has infected thousands of people in Canada, has been mild so far. But the brewing pot that is the military hub for NATO force in this part of the country presents special challenges.</p>
<p>The population is largely of the age that has proven susceptible to the virus, there is a transient work force that is constantly bringing disease in and out of the region, and the medical resources – while state of the art – are finite.</p>
<p>“I can't prove that it's here, but I suspect that it's here. Afghanistan has already recorded some novel H1N1 cases, so we can assume that it's here,” said Lieutenant-Colonel Ron Wojtyk, a Canadian military surgeon and the head physician at the base's NATO hospital.</p>
<p>People who live within the wire confines will tell you that there is a bad bug going around. Those who fall ill develop a fever and a cough, the defining symptoms of the pandemic H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The epidemiological program used by NATO forces around the world has shown no increase in the incidence of influenza. But medical workers say they are seeing more people with respiratory infections.</p>
<p>“We don't have the testing capability here to determine whether it's the novel strain [of influenza] or not,” Dr. Wojtyk said. “We have sent samples of some of the cases of H1N1 that turned our quick test positive for Type A influenza [to Germany for verification] but we haven't got any positive results back. That could be because they were not in fact novel 2009 H1N1. Or it could be that the samples just didn't make it intact enough to render the test positive.”</p>
<p>The mortality rate from the pandemic disease is about the same as the seasonal flu, but medical experts fear it could mutate into something more deadly this fall. That's what happened in 1918 when another H1N1 virus, called the Spanish Flu, killed 50 million to 100 million people worldwide.</p>
<p>That flu swept the globe at the same time nations were fighting the First World War. And, like the current disease, younger people were especially prone.</p>
<p>As a result, the 1918 virus was easily transmitted among soldiers living in trenches. And it returned home with them from the front, accelerating the spread of the deadly virus.</p>
<p>When the current pandemic virus was first discovered in Mexico in March, the medical experts here in Kandahar imposed restrictions to keep it outside the base.</p>
<p>People coming into the air field were surveyed for the disease, those who developed suspect symptoms were isolated, and Mexico was banned as a destination for troops on leave.</p>
<p>But those precautions have since been abandoned.</p>
<p>“Once it spread to Canada, the U.S. and Europe and pretty well everywhere else, we got rid of that. So we have been changing the plan,” Dr. Wotjyk said.</p>
<p>The base has instead adopted the precautions recommended by the Public Health Agency of Canada – frequent hand-washing and self-isolation for those who fall ill – and Dr. Wotjyk is rewriting the protocols that he will soon submit to the base commander for approval.</p>
<p>Since most of the military personnel share rooms with someone else, roommates will be warned to wear masks if the person in the next bunk falls ill. Mass gatherings may eventually be curtailed. And the education program will be stepped up.</p>
<p>If someone develops symptoms so severe that they require hospitalization, they will be treated at the Role 3 medical facility on the base and then evacuated to their home country. The hospital has a fully equipped intensive unit and can look after influenza patient until they are shipped out.</p>
<p>But “if it really gets nasty, like the Spanish influenza, then we would have to consider some very difficult decisions on who gets the ventilators,” Dr. Wotjyk said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he is not overly worried by the fact that the people living on the base are of the age that has been hardest hit by the virus in Canada.</p>
<p>“Our population is very healthy in the main,” Dr. Wotjyk said, “so they would probably be less susceptible to it than people with chronic illness who are the ones that seem to suffer with it the most and the ones who end up dying from it.”</p>

<p>Using the facilities</p>
<p>Nobody felt worse than second-baseman Josh Colafemina of the Quebec Capitales last Wednesday, when a brain cramp led to a six-run, bottom-of-the-ninth rally by the Worcester Tornadoes in Game 2 of the Can-Am League championships. The Capitales ended up winning in the 12th inning to avoid going down 0-2, but Colafemina was kicking himself. "I wanted to throw up, but there's no bathrooms in the Worcester dugout," he said.</p>
<p>A FOOT OUT THE DOOR</p>
<p>You'd think the collaboration between driver and crew chief would be key. But it's going to be tough for Penske Racing boss Pat Tryson and driver Kurt Busch to collaborate. Tryson is defecting to another stable next season, and the Penske people don't want him spying. So they hide the good stuff, and basically banned him. "Tuesday is the only day I'm welcome," Tryson said. The man must be watching a lot of daytime drama these days; he claims he's not allowed to go see his new team the other days of the week, either.</p>
<p>NO DRUNKS, PLEASE</p>
<p>If you're a University of Minnesota student season-ticket holder, and you get kicked out of a football game for being a drunken moron, it's game over. If you want back into the Golden Gophers's new stadium, you have to pass a breathalyzer test at the gate. You can't buy or bring beer into that stadium, a move that will probably cost the school about $1 million this year - not to mention take all the fun out of it. Fans instead get blotto at pregame tailgate parties. In other shocking news, the school isn't getting many complaints. "I think if you're terrible and puking, then are you really enjoying the game? I've been puked on before. You know, that's just not necessary," student Patrick Day said.</p>
<p>BEERLESS IN WISCONSIN</p>
<p>The Minnesota program is believed to be one of only two such dramatic abstinence programs in the U.S. college system; the University of Wisconsin pioneered it five years ago. That program is called the Show and Blow program. Isn't Wisconsin, like, the Beer State? Old Milwaukee? Milwaukee's Best?</p>
<p>WIFELY FLU WARNING</p>
<p>We know University of Florida head football coach Urban Meyer has his head wrapped around X's and O's 24/7. So it took his wife to give him the heads up that there was a potential swine flu problem on his squad, after the University of Wisconsin had 40 players hit with it, and Ole Miss 20. Florida, so far, has three. "My wife, with her great insight, said, 'Do you realize the swine flu and everything is hitting the Florida campus last week?' My gosh," Meyer said. "It is a panic level of proportion I've never seen before."</p>

<p>Delhomme off the hook. "Hey, I know you feel like crap. I mean, you're not a very handsome guy anyway, so. But, the performer, the quarterback ... I never really liked you as a quarterback. But as a person, that's who I love. I love you as a person."</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>The Conservative government is spending more than five times as many taxpayer dollars on promoting its economic plan as it is on raising public awareness about the flu pandemic.</p>
<p>And that's once again raising a long-standing question: when does government advertising cross the line into partisan boosterism?</p>
<p>The feel-good TV ads about stimulus spending directs viewers to a Tory-blue government Web site with more than 40 photos of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and refers repeatedly to "the Harper government," apparently in direct contravention of Treasury Board communications policy.</p>
<p>The TV spots are the latest $5-million salvo in a $34-million media blitz trumpeting the budget.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Public Health Agency of Canada says it has a total marketing budget of $6.5 million to inform Canadians about the H1N1 flu and how to avoid infection.</p>
<p>A government spokesperson said last night that TV ads are to be launched today to raise public awareness about H1N1.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>The federal government won't say if Canadians who suffer harmful side effects from the new swine flu shot can take the vaccine maker to court.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada will not reveal whether drug companies are shielded from H1N1 flu vaccine lawsuits in this country as they are in the United States.</p>
<p>"This is a complex issue which is currently being examined by the federal government," spokesperson Nadia Mostafa said.</p>
<p>That effectively throws a shroud over Ottawa's arrangement with pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, which has a contract to produce 50.4 million doses of the pandemic vaccine at its facility in Ste-Foy, Que.</p>
<p>Conversely, the United States has been open about its decision to protect vaccine makers, government officials and others from lawsuits over the vaccine.</p>

<p>Re: "Vulnerable should get flu vaccine first;Health officials want to target children, elderly," The Journal, Sept. 17.</p>
<p>Our public health officials' plan to give pregnant women and children priority for the H1N1 flu vaccine makes little sense, if we permit the science to guide us.</p>
<p>A large Cochrane Review of many studies and thousands of people found regular flu shots no more effective than a placebo in children six months to two years of age, and preventive only 33 per cent of the time in school-aged children. In healthy adults, flu vaccines reduced the risk by only six per cent.</p>
<p>Risk of serious illness with the H1N1 flu is no different than that posed by regular flu strains. Analysis of official data indicates that 99.97 per cent of those infected will not get seriously ill.</p>
<p>The idea that widespread vaccination is necessary to "keep society functioning" is an unnecessary, fear-inducing stretch. But maybe most significant against that backdrop is unknown vaccine risk.</p>
<p>We don't yet have any significant evidence of safety on the new vaccine; trials so far have been small and short-term, and adverse reactions very often come with time.</p>
<p>Further, current vaccination plans include shots with and without adjuvants, and there is plenty of evidence of toxicity with adjuvants such as squalene, which will very likely be used in at least some batches of the vaccine. Even the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that safety data on new adjuvants is lacking.</p>
<p>In the lab, rats injected with squalene develop an MS-like disease, and in humans squalene can cause severe arthritis, among other things.</p>
<p>We also know that asthma, Type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune disease are more common among vaccinated than unvaccinated children.</p>
<p>What we need is immunity from fear.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Charities, non-profits need help to prepare for flu outbreak; Organizations' role could be seriously undermined in event of pandemic</b>

</p>
<p>Canada's charities and non-profits provide critical services to communities across Canada: What if they are not adequately prepared for an H1N1 outbreak?</p>
<p>I have been getting a lot of blank looks lately. And long pauses over the phone. It happens when I start talking about the potential impact of the influenza pandemic on Canada's charitable and non-profit organizations.</p>
<p>If I focused on hospitals, schools, business or government, I would be joining a lively and useful public debate about how prepared we are, and how prepared we should be, for a major outbreak. But charities and non-profits are too often not part of the discussion.</p>
<p>My question is how prepared are we to meet this potential threat to the ability of charities and non-profit organizations to deliver critical services to Canadians.</p>
<p>Many of our most vulnerable Canadians depend on charities and nonprofits operating in communities, large and small, across the country. Many of these organizations rely on a small number of staff and some, on only a loyal and dedicated band of volunteers. If the H1N1 virus hits Canada hard--and we don't know at this point if the impact will be mild or major--can supports and services be maintained if these organizations lose up to a third of their staff and/or volunteers to illness?</p>
<p>What if food banks start closing --how will desperate families feed their kids?What if meals are no longer prepared and delivered to elderly people who can't get out and who have no friends or relatives nearby to help them? What about Canadians needing dialysis or chemotherapy but who can't get to the hospital because there are no volunteers to drive them?What about the thousands of children and their families who rely on local sports and recreation and arts and cultural organizations for their weekly activities? What if the homeless shelters shut their doors in the middle of winter?</p>
<p>Canada has one of the largest charitable and non-profit sectors in the world. Perhaps because it is so diverse, the sector is generally underestimated. Charities and non-profits provide critical social, family and community services, often in concert with government. Among their many other activities, they help build our quality of life through sport and recreation, arts and culture, health, educational, environmental and philanthropic pursuits. And let's not forget the role they play in supporting people in developing countries around the world. They are the third pillar of Canadian society alongside governments and business.</p>
<p>These organizations are part of an intricate system of societal supports that make us a country that actually works, despite our many economic and social challenges. Without them, those challenges would be much worse and the quality of life of all Canadians would be profoundly diminished. Take charities and nonprofits out of the equation and we would not have the Canada that we know and value.</p>
<p>They are also a significant part of our economy. The sector generates more than $87 billion annually, a contribution of almost seven per cent to Canada's GDP. It employs more than 1.5 million Canadians (full-time equivalents)and mobilizes 12.5 million volunteers in Canada.</p>
<p>The importance of business continuity during an outbreak is being addressed. Major corporations are putting plans in place and the Public Health Agency of Canada recently announced funding for the International Centre for Infectious Diseases (ICID) to help small and medium-sized businesses prepare for a potential outbreak. That makes sense. Everyone wants our economy to keep on working.</p>
<p>Charities and non-profits are part of our economy too, as well as being major contributors to our quality of life. In the event of an outbreak of H1N1, so many of them will be on the front lines supporting and caring for Canadians of all ages and all backgrounds in every community across this country.</p>
<p>The demand many of them face is already greater given the impact of the recession and now they must prepare for the possibility of an H1N1 outbreak. What if they are not adequately prepared?</p>
<p>We will need them more than ever at a time of crisis. This is no time for blank looks. As a country, we need to figure out how we can help them be prepared for whatever this influenza season brings.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ignatieff rips into Tories' record</b>
</div><div>By Chuck Howitt   </div>
<div>Record staff</div>
<div>662 words</div><div>21 September 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>WATERLOO</p>
<p>The Liberal Party abandoned its support for the Conservatives in the House of Commons because of the Tories' terrible record on a whole slew of issues, Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said Saturday.</p>
<p>During a visit to Wilf's campus pub at Wilfrid Laurier University, Ignatieff attacked the Tories on a broad range of issues, including the rising deficit, high unemployment, its response to the H1N1 flu epidemic and its failure to fix the problem over medical isotopes.</p>
<p>After detailing the Tory shortcomings, Ignatieff paused for effect and asked, "Is that good enough?" The audience packed with young Liberals responded on cue with a loud "no."</p>
<p>As students banged thundersticks and chanted "Michael, Michael," Ignatieff took particular issue with Tory ads questioning his years of living and working in Britain and the U.S. Almost 20 per cent of Canadians were born elsewhere, he said, and two million Canadians are currently working in other countries.</p>
<p>"I want a country where everyone sets their sights on going overseas at some point in their lives," he said.</p>
<p>On the federal deficit, the Tories started with a balanced budget, which suddenly ballooned to $32 billion, then $50 billion, and now they're saying it will go to $55 billion, said Ignatieff, who spoke for about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>"It could be $60 billion by Christmas," he added.</p>
<p>To suggestions by the Conservatives that he is trying to force an election for selfish reasons, that he is "only in it for himself," Ignatieff scoffed. "I'm in it for the same reason you're in it, for Canada."</p>
<p>The Tories have dropped the ball on the H1NI flu epidemic, he said, noting that vaccines won't be here for another month and that body bags were callously sent to aboriginal communities.</p>
<p>As for medical isotopes needed for cancer tests, the reactor at Chalk River where they are produced has been shut down twice on the government's watch, he said.</p>
<p>Canada's status as a world leader in this technology is in jeopardy because of the Tories' negligence on this matter, he added.</p>
<p>After his speech, the Liberal leader mingled and chatted with students for about 10 minutes in the packed pub. Joining him at the event were local Liberal candidates Andrew Telegdi, Karen Redman and Teresa Huegle, and Guelph Liberal MP Frank Valeriote.</p>
<p>During a scrum with reporters afterwards, Ignatieff assailed the Tories for ignoring the pleas of Waterloo's Research In Motion and allowing the sale of Nortel Networks' wireless assets to Ericsson of Sweden.</p>
<p>"They (Conservatives) are just walking by the Nortel sale. They haven't stood up for the Canadian intellectual property that keeps Kitchener-Waterloo humming."</p>
<p>On the issue of student debt, Ignatieff said he was "disturbed" to learn in chats with students before the event that some are having to interrupt their studies to find work to pay for their education.</p>
<p>"We've got to relieve the burden of student debt," he said, and one of the keys to doing that is providing incentives to employers to hire "the best and brightest coming out of our colleges and universities."</p>
<p>In an interview on Sunday, Cambridge MP Gary Goodyear said the Liberal leader is trying to force an election that could jeopardize Canada's economic recovery.</p>
<p>"It's very clear to me that Mr. Ignatieff is going to stop at nothing to plunge this country into an election of an opportunistic nature."</p>
<p>Goodyear said the national unemployment rate of 8.7 per cent is lower than it was in the mid-1990s and the Tories plan to balance the budget by 2015.</p>
<p>In urging an election now, Ignatieff is "putting himself above the nation," Goodyear said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The body bag insult</b>
</div><div>Toronto Star</div>

</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from an editorial in the Toronto Star on Friday.</p>
<p>These are scary days for vulnerable First Nations communities across Canada, as the flu season closes in. They have fairly begged Ottawa to beef up health personnel and equipment, and to speed up deliveries of H1N1 vaccines, Tamiflu, sanitizers, face masks, gloves, thermometers, acetaminophen and other supplies.</p>
<p>So what did they get by way of comfort from the federal government?</p>
<p>Body bags.</p>
<p>Health Canada's Manitoba office couldn't have chosen a more inappropriate moment to ship some 200 bags to remote communities that were hard hit by flu in the spring. They were delivered in a routine prewinter restocking exercise, primarily for use in fatal accidents, and were not "linked exclusively" to H1N1, officials say.</p>
<p>Still, at a time when native leaders are appealing for preventive measures, and when Ottawa is shipping in "flu kits, " the cargo of body bags was insensitive, unnecessary and unwelcome. …</p>
<p>This isn't the first time federal health bureaucrats have come under fire for callousness. Last spring, Health Canada delayed shipping hand sanitizer to hard-hit communities for fear that First Nations people would drink the alcohol-laden cleanser. The body bags add insult to insensitivity.</p>
