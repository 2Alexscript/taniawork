<p>H1N1 is making the rounds again this fall, and so is the debate over what to call it. Last weekend, 120 agricultural journalists and communications gathered for the annual meeting of the Canadian Farm Writers Federation in Edmonton and heard Alberta communications specialist Lee Funke's take on the matter.</p>
<p>His is a pertinent perspective. Funke was recruited by the pork sector for front-line duty when H1N1 arrived in Canada in April. He was the face and voice of Rocky Mountain House pork producer Arnold Van Ginkel, who was reluctant to appear or speak on camera.</p>
<p>So how does Funke feel about naming the disease?</p>
<p>Non-plussed, at best.</p>
<p>"You're fighting a losing battle trying to get people to stop using (the term) swine flu," he said. Media spokespeople's contact time with reporters is highly limited, and he suggested time be proportioned appropriately.</p>
<p>"Am I going to use all my exposure (to a reporter) to try to get the facts across about H1N1," he asked, "or on what to call it?"</p>
<p>Well, that depends on who you ask.</p>
<p>Some - including U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Guelph MP Frank Valeriote and Guelph's Gordon Sloan - argue that explaining why the name is wrong (it's not all about pigs; the flu has human and avian components, too) can indeed lead to a deeper discussion about the disease itself.</p>
<p>From Washington, Vilsack said last week that choosing H1N1 terminology avoids "undue and undeserved harm" to pork producers.</p>
<p>For his part, Valeriote has written CBC accusing the news organization, which has been unmoved by pleas to drop "swine flu," of ignoring its national role.</p>
<p>"Surely there is a greater good to be achieved in the agriculture industry, that both deserves and requires our help, than there is harm to be created, if any at all, by abandoning the swine flu nomenclature," he wrote. "As a public institution, with an identified conscience . . . the public would expect this kind of conscientious response."</p>
<p>And earlier this month, self-motivated agricultural advocate Sloan, who has passionately campaigned against the swine flu moniker in defence of his rural Ontario roots, fired a volley by sending the tri-nation accord on H1N1 to more CBC executives. The accord, signed by agricultural leaders from Canada, the U.S. and Mexico last month, says "identifying new or existing diseases of public health concern with technically incorrect names had resulted in confusion among consumers, market and trade disruptions and significant losses to the agricultural industry."</p>
<p>However, some media stand firm. The Canadian Press commissioned an independent consumer poll last month to test the waters, and the results were stark. The poll showed 90 per cent of Canadians understand they can't get the H1N1 virus from eating pork. Only six per cent of respondents to the poll felt they could contract the flu from handling or eating pork, and just three per cent said they're eating less pork.</p>
<p>The results weakened the anti-swine flu name drive - or did they? As this column was going to press, CBC news online had two headline stories about the disease. One headline was predictable, "Swine flu changes greetings, hockey habits." But the other, "H1N1 vaccine priority groups released," suggests maybe there's some movement after all.</p>
<p>One thing is certain, though - the pork industry considers itself in peril. Ottawa threw it a multi-million-dollar lifeline a few weeks ago, but pig farmers say that hasn't stopped the damage from chronic low prices and high production costs.</p>
<p>At press time, a pork-producer rally was being planned in Mitchell, to address what the organizers label a "crisis."</p>
<p>Deep trouble remains. It's no wonder pig farmers want the term swine flu to disappear.</p>

<p>The Archdiocese of Toronto has released a list of recommendations to help churches and churchgoers stave off the spread of the H1N1 swine flu virus this fall.</p>
<p>The recommendations, developed after several months of consultations with health officials, are intended to bolster the usual reminders to practise frequent handwashing, cough into a sleeve or tissue, stay home when feeling ill, and regularly disinfect common surfaces.</p>
<p>Archbishop Thomas Collins, in a letter posted in Roman Catholic churches yesterday, urges parishioners to do away with the customary handshake when giving the Sign of Peace and instead bow, saying "Peace be with you."</p>
<p>Collins also suggests hand-cleaning stations be added in churches near entrances, and reminds those distributing communion that they must always clean their hands before and after the ritual.</p>
<p>Churchgoers who feel ill, have a fever, or have recently been sick should avoid receiving bread on their tongues or drinking from the cup at communion, he adds.</p>
<p>The Archdiocese will monitor the situation this flu season and will implement additional measures if necessary. More information can be found online at: www.archtoronto.org/flu[http://www.archtoronto.org/flu].</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- The Conservative government is spending more than five times as many taxpayer dollars on promoting its economic plan as it is on raising public awareness about the flu pandemic.</p>
<p>That, once again, raises a long-standing question: when does government advertising cross the line into partisan boosterism?</p>
<p>TV viewers may have noticed the latest feel-good government ads about stimulus spending.</p>
<p>All the ads direct viewers to a Tory-blue website that includes more than 40 different photos of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and refers repeatedly to "the Harper government" - apparently in direct contravention of Treasury Board communications policy.</p>
<p>The TV spots are just the latest $5 million salvo in a $34 million media blitz trumpeting the Conservatives' recession-fighting budget.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, public health officials are fretting over the fall flu season, the spread of the H1N1 virus and widespread public apathy about the need for vaccination.</p>
<p>Government officials did not respond to a specific query from The Canadian Press last week on whether TV ads were in the works to combat swine flu.</p>
<p>But a government spokesman last night said TV ads are to be launched today across the country to raise public awareness about H1N1.</p>
<p>The official said the government has planned for some time to launch the TV ads.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada says it has a total marketing budget of $6.5 million to inform Canadians about H1N1 and how to avoid infection.</p>
<p>Some $4.5 million of that was spent on ads in newspapers, public transit ads and on the Internet, which ran from April to August.</p>
<p>The health agency has committed another $2 million to radio spots that began airing last week, as new swine flu outbreaks were reported.</p>
<p>Opposition MPs say the spending disparity in the two ad campaigns shows the government is using public funds to toot its own horn.</p>
<p>"Guys, you're spending all this money to promote yourselves. Maybe some work on the prevention of H1N1 would be helpful," Liberal critic Martha Hall Findlay said in an interview.</p>
<p>Federal ad guidelines speak of not promoting any political party or entity.</p>
<p>Hall Findlay concedes rules are so loose as to be unenforceable.</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- Can Canadians who suffer harmful side effects from the new swine flu shot can take the vaccine maker to court? The federal government isn't saying.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada will not reveal whether drug firms are shielded from H1N1 flu vaccine lawsuits here as they are in the United States.</p>
<p>"This is a complex issue which is currently being examined by the federal government," spokeswoman Nadia Mostafa said by email. "It raises legal questions involving federal/provincial and public/private sector jurisdictions. The federal government will provide additional details around this issue in due course, following appropriate discussions/deliberations."</p>
<p>That effectively throws a shroud over Ottawa's arrangement with pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, which has a contract to produce 50.4 million doses of pandemic vaccine at its plant in Ste-Foy, Que.</p>
<p>Conversely, the United States has been open about its decision to protect vaccine makers, government officials and others from lawsuits over the vaccine.</p>
<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius granted legal immunity to "individuals and entities involved in all stages of 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine development, testing, manufacture, distribution, prescribing, administration, and use," a U.S. health department website says. It does not cover harm due to wilful misconduct.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Body bags another blunder for Tories -</b>
</div><div>Hill Talk / By Mia Rabson   </div>

</p>
<p>Reaction was swift last week when First Nations in northern Manitoba opened up shipments of supplies to fight H1N1 influenza only to find body bags amid their hand sanitizers and face masks.</p>
<p>As the news bubbled out, it caused a virtual cyclone among opposition MPs on Parliament Hill, who were tripping over one another to respond following question period Wednesday. Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq looked stunned by the situation when she spoke of it at a regularly scheduled pandemic flu news conference.</p>
<p>It was a political nightmare for the minister, but just the latest blunder in the government's handling of H1N1 on reserves. From the month-long delay in shipping hand sanitizer to Island Lake reserves in the spring, to the lack of communication with chiefs and now body bags, it's long been clear the department was not prepared for the potential public health nightmare on Canada's reserves in a global pandemic.</p>
<p>What is even more disturbing is the flippancy with which some in Aglukkaq's department dismiss First Nation concerns. In August, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs began fundraising to put together flu kits for every home on all of the 60-plus reserves in Manitoba. The provincial government committed some money, but Aglukkaq and Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, would not.</p>
<p>They have continually said they don't know what is in the kits and therefore aren't funding them. When the story first broke, that response was appropriate, but wouldn't it behoove the minister and the nation's top public health doctor to find out the contents so they could make an informed decision?</p>
<p>The lack of this knowledge stood out at the H1N1 news conference Wednesday when Butler-Jones was asked yet again why the flu kits were being denied funding, but the government was willing to send in body bags.</p>
<p>"It's a totally unnecessary thing," Butler-Jones said of the kits.</p>
<p>Then he went on to say that all people need to help fight the pandemic is hand sanitizer, Tylenol, a thermometer and soap and water to wash your hands frequently.</p>
<p>Guess what is in the kits? Hand sanitizer, Tylenol and a thermometer.</p>
<p>If he feels there are contents in the kits such as face masks and gloves that are unnecessary and potentially harmful -- he has said he fears they give a false sense of security and prevent frequent handwashing -- that's where direct discussions with native leaders would help.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I wrote about the Winnipeg advertising and design firm that had landed a big contract with the federal Conservatives to produce direct-to-your-inbox videos.</p>
<p>The story became slightly more interesting when, after my column ran, Mars Hill Group removed the promotional paragraph on its website mentioning the contract. It was reported the change was made because Senator Mike Duffy objected to the company saying he was a longtime party supporter.</p>
<p>The controversy didn't affect Duffy's participation, however. He was, as advertised, the star of the first of the videos that hit email inboxes last week.</p>
<p>The video is long, at almost three minutes. But it was personalized, with Duffy delivering a bright "Hi Gordon" before launching into a formulaic promotion of the Conservative platform and its record.</p>
<p>Given how well U.S. President Barack Obama used the Internet to get his message out and organize grassroots supporters, it will be interesting to see if this new foray for the Conservatives will bear fruit.</p>

<p>Following a tense week that saw it criticized for sending body bags to First Nations, the federal government on Saturday announced a joint action plan with Canada's aboriginal communities to deal with potentially deadly outbreaks of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, along with Chuck Strahl, minister of Indian and northern affairs, and newly elected Assembly of First Nations Chief Shawn Atleo signed a communication protocol to deal with issues such as the delivery of medical supplies and water to "highly vulnerable" isolated aboriginal communities, where there is little access to health care.</p>
<p>The plan includes monthly committee meetings with government officials and First Nations leaders as well as an online summit co-chaired by Aglukkaq and Atleo near the end of October on how to deal with H1N1, the virus formerly known as swine flu.</p>
<p>"The virtual summit complements the intent of the collaboration and working together," said Aglukkaq. "Chief Atleo, the government of Canada and First Nations communities will be ready (for) a new wave of H1N1 if and when we need to."</p>
<p>Atleo said the agreement is an important step forward in working together to prevent a potential crisis in remote aboriginal communities.</p>
<p>"We know that our people are at risk and we know they are more vulnerable . . . whether it is overcrowding and housing issues or poverty or access to water. The isolation gives rise to challenges to get health care," said Atleo.</p>
<p>Saturday's announcement comes just days after Health Canada was embroiled in a controversy over a shipment of body bags to reserves, a move the Liberals attacked the Conservatives for, accusing the health minister of sending a message to First Nations that the government expects them to die during a pandemic.</p>
<p>The move increased tensions that were already mounting between the government and First Nations over a lack of communication about how to prepare for a pandemic. Leaders of several Manitoba First Nations communities voiced feelings of abandonment after they had asked for help months ago, and instead were insulted to receive a larger-than-normal supply of body bags.</p>

<p>He lurched out of the gutter, staggered, almost toppled over -- I couldn't tell if he was drunk or simply top-heavy, betrayed by a combination of giant head, curly little tail and gravity.</p>
<p>"Buy me a drink!" he demanded, with an exclamation point.</p>
<p>Ah, there was my answer: Plastered as the Sistine Chapel. Apostrophe had gone over the top, as usual.</p>
<p>"Don't you mean 'Buy me a drink?' with a question mark?" I replied.</p>
<p>"No," Apostrophe said, "It's an imperative. Buy me one for National Punctuation Day."</p>
<p>I slapped my forehead, winced.</p>
<p>His shoulders slumped. "You forgot."</p>
<p>"Its not like its Christmas," I whined by way of apology.</p>
<p>"It's!" he snapped. "Not its, it's!"</p>
<p>I cringed. Mine was the sort of thoughtlessness that led to poor Apostrophe's downfall in the first place.</p>
<p>You might recall meeting him a few years ago. He was once a proud pillar of the language community, a little possessive perhaps, but beloved by poets who used words like e'er, o'er and 'tis. ("More contractions than a maternity ward," he sniffled.)</p>
<p>Then writers got sloppy, began dropping the apostrophe for no reason, or 'using' it for single quotation marks 'inappropriately.' Even signmakers couldn't get him right: "It's Men's, not Mens," he shouted at the washroom door. It was the absence of an apostrophe at <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> that finally sent him over the edge, drinking double-doubles.</p>
<p>It's not just the apostrophe, of course. Commas, colons, long dashes -- few seem to understand the common symbols often referred to as the traffic signs of the English language. Text messaging on handheld devices has worsened the confusion; BlackBerry treats punctuation marks as second-class citizens, consigns them to the keypad's cheap seats, stuck in out-of-the-way places accessible only by four-wheel drive and an awkward combination of buttons. The result is no punctuation at all: "cant make it c u l8r"</p>
<p>This is, one must acknowledge, the second sign of the end of civilization as we know it (the first was the sale of lime-flavoured beer). Start breaking the language laws, and next thing you know it's full-scale anarchy, panic-stricken English teachers barricaded inside empty schools while illiterate Road Warrior savages rat race down bombed-out streets with screaming librarians lashed to their fenders.</p>
<p>Which brings us to National Punctuation Day this Thursday. It's a newish holiday, founded in 2004 by American Jeff Rubin, who seems determined to root out the rot. "There's an epidemic of poor punctuation in the United States, much like the swine flu," Rubin says in a press release. "It's too bad there's no vaccine to prevent it.</p>
<p>"Casual shortcuts bred by e-mailing and text messaging have no place in school papers or professional business writing," Rubin writes. "In the business world, words have power and help decision-makers form impressions immediately. Careless punctuation mistakes cost time, money, and productivity." His website -- nationalpunctuationday.com -- points to a 2006 Globe and Mail story about a misplaced contract comma that exposed Rogers Communications to a $2.13-million utility-pole bill.</p>
<p>Rubin is described as a former newspaperman. I'm not sure those are the best credentials for a language campaigner; it's like saying your appendix is to be removed by a former first-aid attendant. Journalists tend to use English in the same way a monkey drives a Ferrari.</p>
<p>Personally, if I had understood the difference between "You never call me anymore" and "You, never call me anymore" I might have avoided a nasty restraining order.</p>
<p>But I get Rubin's point, and so do others. Britain's Lynn Truss surprised herself and the world when her book Eats, Shoots and Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation became an international bestseller in 2004. (She dedicated it to "the memory of the striking Bolshevik printers of St. Petersburg who, in 1905, demanded to be paid the same rate for punctuation marks as for letters, and thereby directly precipitated the first Russian Revolution.") Some editions even come with a Punctuation Repair Kit at the front, peel-off stickers printed with commas, periods and semi-colons that can be applied to public signs by guerrilla grammarians.</p>
<p>They can start with the sign on the Mens room.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Body bag fiasco reveals attitude of insensitivity</b>
</div><div>The StarPhoenix</div>
<div>655 words</div><div>21 September 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>That it didn't occur to anyone at Health Canada that it's a numbskull notion to toss in 200 body bags into shipments of gloves, hand sanitizers and masks headed to remote First Nations communities is nearly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>That at least a couple of reserves in northern Manitoba that were shocked to receive 30 body bags each were among those hardest hit by the H1N1 flu this spring and have been anxiously awaiting a government response to avoid a calamity from the projected pandemic this fall only points to a breathtaking insensitivity.</p>
<p>Just as hard to comprehend is the explanation by bureaucrats that there was nothing all that unusual about the body bag shipments -- that they were just part of a pre-winter "routine restocking" of supplies -- except that they may have overestimated the need and shipped an excessive number.</p>
<p>"Some of these communities are unreachable by road, water or air during the winter months. In other words, they wouldn't be able to bring these supplies into some of these communities should they become necessary," offered Jim Wolfe, director of First Nations and Inuit health in Manitoba.</p>
<p>The explanation rings hollow, considering that most of the communities can be and are reached year-round by aircraft in good weather.</p>
<p>For a Conservative government that has been dragging its feet on formulating Canada's strategy to handle what health experts have been projecting will be a serious H1N1 outbreak, and only last week even came up with a priority list for vaccinations that most other developed nations have had in place for months, the gaffe couldn't have come at a worse time.</p>
<p>Its relationship with many of Canada's aboriginal leaders have been strained at best over such moves as the scuttling the Kelowna Accord.</p>
<p>Although the idiocy involving the body bags is solely that of Health Canada officials, it's understandable why some First Nations leaders interpret this as an example of a callous Conservative administration abandoning aboriginal people at a time when they need federal help with what they keep being told is an urgent health issue.</p>
<p>It's no wonder that a horrified Grand Chief David Harper, who speaks for northern First Nations in Manitoba said:</p>
<p>"It really makes me wonder if health officials know something we don't. . . . I make a plea to the people of Canada to work with us to ensure the lowest fatalities from this monster virus. Don't send us body bags. Help us organize; send us medicine."</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, herself an aboriginal woman who grew up in remote communities, got it absolutely right when she said what happened is unacceptable -- that it was insensitive and offensive.</p>
<p>Surely, Mr. Wolfe, whose position puts him in charge of First Nations and Inuit health in Manitoba, and his colleagues, if they are to do their jobs effectively, should have a modicum of understanding of the culture of Native people and how to handle such matters in a more sensitive manner.</p>
<p>As Chief Harper pointed out, many First Nations cultures believe that to prepare for death is to invite it.</p>
<p>Even through it's the job of public health officials to prepare for fatalities -- whether it's from an H1N1 epidemic that might devastate remote communities where crowded housing and poor sanitation conditions will prove preventive measures impossible, or whether it's from a crash of a passenger aircraft -- the body bag shipment should have been handled better than to make it part of a "flu kit."</p>
<p>From this incident to the case this spring when, after weeks of discussion, health bureaucrats decided they wouldn't ship hand sanitizers to reserves because they feared people would consume the alcohol-laden contents, what's evident is an insensitive "we know best" mindset that marginalizes aboriginal leaders and creates problems when co-operation and discussion would prove productive.</p>

<p>When an employee came back to work at <span class="companylink">McElhanney Land Surveys Ltd</span>. earlier this year after visiting Mexico, managers had the worker visit a doctor to get cleared before coming back to work to ensure the safety of its workforce and to allay fears.</p>
<p>That was the first wave. During the anticipated second wave this fall, that strategy won't work. Experts predict up to 30 per cent of the workforce could fall ill with the H1N1 influenza virus this fall and pandemic planners say most companies haven't done enough to prepare.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that all indications are that the swine flu will hit hard," says Bob Klay, a business continuity planner with Klay Management Ltd. "Too many companies are not very prepared."</p>
<p>Many companies are lulled into a false sense of preparedness because they have some kind of policy, but the devil is always in the details and execution is what really matters in a pandemic.</p>
<p>McElhanney's health, safety and environment manager, Darrell Florence, began developing a pandemic plan in 2006 after the appearance of avian flu, or H5N1. He knows there's lots of information and pandemic plans available, but says tailoring available plans to every individual organization is what will make the difference when flu hits.</p>
<p>"Off-the-shelf is a great place to start, but you have to identify the risks relative to your own individual business," says Florence, who has employees working at remote work camps scattered across the province and office workers in Calgary and Edmonton.</p>
<p>His pandemic planning team brought in Juanita House, a registered nurse and occupational health and wellness specialist, to refine the firm's pandemic plan.</p>
<p>"Anybody can get access to a pandemic policy and re-word it the way they want, but does it really work the way you want when it gets down to the implementation level? You have to bring it into the business and actually make it work for people," says House.</p>
<p>Pandemic planning guidelines are available through the World Health Organization, the Public Health Agency of Canada and other organizations, but that's just a starting point from a business context.</p>
<p>Accuracy and execution are critical factors to any pandemic plan, says Klay. There are often many considerations people have not thought about or haven't addressed how to overcome if they occur.</p>
<p>"The problem with influenza . . . is that you can be infectious, contagious, before you're symptomatic and that's where a lot of fear gets ratcheted up," says Pat Pitsel, president of consulting firm Pitsel and Associates.</p>
<p>Companies need to start with figuring out how to manage without a third of their staff, how to provide services to customers during the pandemic -- people tend to stay as isolated as possible -- identify critical positions in the company and cross-train to ensure continued operations and look at all aspects of operations and safety for workers.</p>
<p>Work refusals could become a problem for companies.</p>
<p>Security is another big risk, both physical security and information technology security. Many firms plan to let employees work from home, but that poses risks, too.</p>
<p>With every plan, it comes down to communication with employees and getting workers on-board with doing everything they can to minimize the risks.</p>

<p>As they learn about literature, first love and their own newfound independence, B.C.'s university students will also be revisiting some very rudimentary lessons this year: Wash your hands.</p>
<p>Cough into your elbow.</p>
<p>If you're sick, stay home.</p>
<p>As health authorities across the country -- and the world --prepare for flu season and a possible escalation of the H1N1 flu virus, universities are taking their own measures to prevent the spread of influenza on campus.</p>
<p>They've installed hand sanitizers, put up posters about cleanliness, and made information guidebooks about H1N1 part of orientation packages.</p>
<p>In total, the B.C. Centre for Disease Control has confirmed 48 severe H1N1 cases in the province, resulting in five deaths.</p>
<p>All of the victims had prior medical conditions, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>For the most part, say university health faculties, the difference between H1N1 and the regular flu is negligible, with coughing, watery eyes, respiratory problems and fever being common symptoms of both.</p>
<p>But they also say that insular campus communities make students vulnerable to the virus spreading.</p>
<p>"Essentially what we're anticipating is that it's going to be a bad flu season," said Apollonia Cifarelli, the director of environment, health and safety at Simon Fraser University.</p>
<p>"Our biggest concern is making certain that people understand that they shouldn't be coming to campus if they're ill, because if they continue to come, then it will just spread rampantly." But for thousands of students living in residence, going home simply isn't an option. Of the 8,000 students living at the University of B.C., about 1,200 reside at Totem Park.</p>
<p>One of them, Chafic Mekkaoui, 19, says that while students are being well educated about the flu, it's still a cause of worry.</p>
<p>"When people [in residence] get sick, it's hard not to get it," he said. "There's so much mingling going around." Still, Mekkaoui added, students appear to be taking the flu precautions seriously. "You see people going crazy with the hand sanitizer," he said.</p>
<p>Ayesha Zahid, 18, who also lives at Totem Park, said her concern is less about herself than others.</p>
<p>"People have different habits of cleanliness. If I'm taking precautions, maybe someone else is not." Looking out for friends, however, is a key part of many universities' H1N1 plans.</p>
<p>The University of Victoria's 2,500 students in residence have "flu buddies," whereby each student has a friend to check on them and bring them meals if they get sick.</p>
<p>And at the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George, where students live in apartment-style housing, residents who get the flu will be segregated in individual rooms.</p>
<p>The most important part is that students who fall ill stay away from each other, said Richard Piskor, UVic's health spokesman.</p>
<p>"If you're sick, self-isolate and don't spread it around to others," he said. "And when the sickness resolves, come back to class. We'll be happy to see you." - For more information on the H1N1 flu virus, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/[http://www.gov.bc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/] h1n1.</p>

<p>Following a tense week that saw it criticized for sending body bags to aboriginals, the federal government yesterday announced a joint action plan with Canada's aboriginal communities to deal with potentially deadly outbreaks of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, along with Chuck Strahl, minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, and newly elected Assembly of First Nations Chief Shawn Atleo signed a communication protocol to deal with issues such as the delivery of medical supplies and water to "highly vulnerable" isolated aboriginal communities, where there is little access to health care.</p>
<p>The plan includes monthly committee meetings with government officials and aboriginal leaders as well as an online summit co-chaired by Aglukkaq and Atleo near the end of October on how to deal with the H1N1, the virus formerly known as swine flu.</p>
<p>"The virtual summit complements the intent of the collaboration and working together," Aglukkaq said. "Chief Atleo, the government of Canada and aboriginal communities will be ready (for) a new wave of H1N1 if and when we need to."</p>
<p>Atleo said the agreement is an important step forward in working together to prevent a potential crisis in remote aboriginal communities.</p>
<p>"We know that our people are at risk and we know they are more vulnerable, whether it is overcrowding and housing issues or poverty or access to water. The isolation gives rise to challenges to get health care," Atleo said. "Like so many of our communities, there are excellent efforts happening on the ground, hard-working frontline health workers, and this effort is about listening to each other and to work closely with one another. Our people deserve this."</p>
<p>Yesterday's announcement comes just days after Health Canada was embroiled in a controversy over a shipment of body bags to reserves, a move the Liberals attacked the Conservatives for, accusing the health minister of sending a message to aboriginals that the government expects them to die during a pandemic. The move increased tensions that were already mounting between the government and aboriginals over a lack of communication about how to prepare for a pandemic. Leaders of several Manitoba aboriginal communities voiced feelings of abandonment after they had asked for help months ago.</p>
<p>Four reserves said they received body bags in shipments from Health Canada on Tuesday. The shipments also included hand sanitizer and face masks and are routinely delivered to the nursing stations.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq on Wednesday ordered an investigation and released a statement saying as an aboriginal person she was offended and that what happened was "unacceptable." Health Canada on Thursday issued a formal apology, citing an error made in the number of bags shipped.</p>
<p>At a news conference in Ottawa yesterday, Aglukkaq said the federal government has made information available on its "fight flu" website - fightflu.ca - which has specific information on aboriginal communities. She said Health Canada is working with aboriginal communities to update and co-ordinate their pandemic plans.</p>
<p>"We've been providing all nursing stations in First Nations communities with additional protective medical supplies, such as gloves, gowns and masks," she said.</p>
<p>In British Columbia, where an outbreak of H1N1 on a reserve on Vancouver Island was cited as evidence that the first outbreak of the fall had arrived, Strahl said special teams of emergency personnel have been created to be deployed to remote communities should critical infrastructure be affected.</p>

There were threats and posturing and a mighty thumping of chests that had the country's political class delighted with itself, but which left the nation's citizenry in incomprehension and incipient rage.</p>
<p>This was Big, the media and politicians declared, yet almost nobody outside the inner circle had a clue what was going on. Canadians dealing with important matters like the intractability of a golf slice, or raccoons under the cottage, learned that their government was going to fall on the world-shaking issue of employment insurance.</p>
<p>Pfui, said the voters, who simply refused to get either excited or worried - although the possibility of their becoming seriously p-d off was clearly in the air. Result: Enough Ottawa notables were talked in off the window-ledge, and life will go on. But the parties' many pollsters are now busily dissecting recent events, searching for political advantage, and the whole cycle could repeat itself this fall.</p>
<p>That is the bad news: Ottawa's craziness continues. It still threatens to precipitate our fourth general election in less than six years - one that might still not prove definitive, but leave things much as they are right now. That would add to the sense of futility, and who could blame the voters - or, in the saddest current development in our politics, the non-voters, almost one-half of all of us, who have already given up on the system.</p>
<p>We really must do better. Readers who have stuck with this column for years will recognize a pundit warming up for a pitch on the virtues of minority government, properly conducted. Our system of parliamentary government may work most efficiently when a majority is in power, but there are times when minorities do us proud.</p>
<p>Two examples leap to mind. First, Lester Pearson from 1963 to 1968. It is a curious fact that Pearson, perhaps Canada's most distinguished international figure ever, never won a majority from his fellows at home. Part of his trouble was the large and lumpy delegation of Créditistes from Quebec's hinterland led by Réal Caouette, a precursor to today's Bloc Québécois.</p>
<p>Despite this parliamentary weakness, Pearson's accomplishment in those few years were astonishing: medicare, Canada Pension Plan, Canada Assistance Plan, the flag, auto pact, Bi and Bi Commission and on and on. The era was marked by political scandal (remember the Dorion inquiry) and Pearson always seemed to be stepping into something unpleasant, but his actual record is long and distinguished and all achieved with minority support.</p>
<p>Then there was the experience of Bill Davis in Ontario in the 1970s. I covered many of those years at Queen's Park. The Tories, in power for more than three decades, had become swaggering and insufferable, revelling in the nickname "the Big Blue Machine."</p>
<p>Ministers treated their critics contemptuously. Tory majorities pushed legislation through after midnight. Mandarins were inaccessible to reporters or citizens trying to find out what was going on in the public service.</p>
<p>Davis paid for the arrogance, losing his majority in 1975 and failing to get it back in a snap election in 1977. This was probably the best thing that ever happened to him - he would not return to majority status until 1981. During the minority years, Davis's government opened up remarkably. It began to treat the legislature with care and respect, became more open in its explanations and almost made an orator of Davis himself, who toured the province tirelessly. In the end, he enjoyed 14 years as premier of the province before retiring full of years and honours.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice to see Stephen Harper spend the rest of his prime ministerial years like this - supported only by minorities, stretching out for support, accessible to Parliament and his fellow citizens, a welcoming smile of inclusion on his face, a before-and-after embodiment of P.G. Wodehouse's observation that "It is never difficult to distinguish between a Scotsman with a grievance and a ray of sunshine"?</p>
<p>Seems unlikely, though. For our prime minister, it seems to be all-partisanship, all-attack, all the time, and double time on holidays. We got a glimpse of the true, deep Harper during the recent crisis, when he predicted that the Liberals, if victorious in an election, would stack the judiciary, Senate and all things federal with (wait for it) "left-wing ideologues."</p>
<p>It's as clear an indication as we are ever likely to get of what Harper himself would likely do with a majority, and that is: Appoint right-wing ideologues. Real ones. All the time.</p>
<p>Something to remember when the Ottawa Follies resume.</p>

<p>Re: "Ottawa apologizes for body bag error," Sept. 18.</p>
<p>Canadians should not be shocked or surprised with this despicable, degrading, culturally insensitive act by a minister in this government. The blame lays clearly with Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq. It is called ministerial responsibility. The public health and safety of Canadians is not, and has never been, high on the agenda of</p>
<p>this ideological and politically driven government. In this regard, this government's record of failure and indifference speaks for itself: food safety, product safety, aviation safety, rail safety, the isotope debacle and now H1N1. In light of this unforgivable and insulting act, the health minister should resign from cabinet and stand down in the next election. Canadians, and especially aboriginal Canadians, deserve and expect this. Anything less flies in the face of public trust, political accountability and public health and safety.</p>

<p>Can we please be allowed to enjoy life without having every Tom, Dick and Harr, looking for fame, attention, or a possible grant for further studies, make us want to curl up in a dark corner? Thanks to these scientists and researchers, you can no longer relax and enjoy life the way it is meant to be.</p>
<p>We're now told that shower heads are a breeding ground for bacteria. In the same breath, we are told to wash our hands because of the H1N1 virus. But taps, too, retain water, so would also have bacteria. Where do we wash then? In the river?</p>
<p>We're also told that you shouldn't eat salmon raised in farms because of the antibiotics they're fed. That means that salmon should be sold with a birth certificate showing where they were hatched.</p>
<p>We're told that grain-fed chickens, because they were not force fed, contain less cholesterol and are therefore healthier. Should they be sold with their passports? Red meat, reportedly, should be eaten only once or twice a week; yet people who are anemic are told to eat a lot of red meat.We are told the sun is not good for you; yet, many articles suggest sessions in the sun for extra vitamin D.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on. We are sick of being told what's good for us and what's not good for us. If there's one thing that really makes us sick, it is these reports.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pharmacists relish new roles; Giving injections just part of 'evolving career'</b>
</div><div>Wendy Mclellan   </div>
<div>The Province</div>
<div>859 words</div><div>20 September 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A31 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>A passion for science combined with a desire to work with people equals the perfect prescription for a successful career as a pharmacist.</p>
<p>It's a profession in high demand in B.C. as well in the rest of the world, and with pharmacists taking on additional roles to provide health-care services in the province, it's becoming an even more interesting career option.</p>
<p>Beginning this fall, B.C. pharmacists will be able to administer injections, including the H1N1 flu</p>
<p>vaccine to patients, which will reduce the pressure on doctors' offices and make it more convenient for people to protect themselves from the virus.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the government also gave pharmacists the authority to renew and alter prescriptions without first sending patients to their doctor's office.</p>
<p>"It's a really exciting and evolving career," says Marshall Moleschi, registrar of the B.C. College of Pharmacists. "Pharmacists are the medication experts in the health profession and there is a huge need for them.</p>
<p>"For people interested in the sciences, it's a profession where you can apply your knowledge and really interact with patients -- they are the most accessible health professionals."</p>
<p>Pharmacists are trained to ensure patients receive the most appropriate medications, and that prescriptions don't cause problems because of drug interactions.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a career in pharmacy meant working behind a raised counter in a neighbourhood drug store. Pharmacists may still decide to work in a drug store but many more are joining health-care teams at long-term care facilities, specialized clinics and hospitals.</p>
<p>And even in the local drug store, they are liaising with local clinics and increasing their services to patients at the counter.</p>
<p>"There are lots of opportunities," Moleschi says. "Pharmacists are getting more involved in direct patient care, in HIV clinics, diabetes programs, geriatrics."</p>
<p>B.C. has a continuing shortage of trained pharmacists, especially in communities outside Metro Vancouver, which will likely continue as the population ages.</p>
<p>Becoming a pharmacist takes five years at university to meet minimum requirements. Students interested in a specialty or hospital work pursue more training or complete a doctoral degree. Salaries for pharmacists start in the $50,000-to-$60,000 range, rising to $100,000 for those with advanced degrees.</p>
<p>Competition is fierce for a place in a university program in Canada, but a new facility at the University of B.C. will expand the number of spaces for students studying pharmaceutical science.</p>
<p>An additional 72 spaces, beginning in the fall of 2011, will also reduce the province's dependence on other provinces, and countries, to meet the demand for pharmacists here.</p>
<p>"We're trying to meet the needs for pharmacists in B.C. -- we can't do it at this point, but this is a big, bold step," says Dr. Robert Sindelar, dean of UBC's program.</p>
<p>UBC and the University of Toronto have Canada's only two pharmaceutical science undergraduate programs.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Loewen, a professor with the UBC program and regional co-ordinator of pharmacy services for Vancouver area hospitals, says people who choose a career in pharmacy typically want to work in science but don't want to be confined to a laboratory.</p>
<p>"They want to be involved in health care, to interact directly with patients," Loewen says. "They want to improve people's health and well-being and develop relationships, but they're also looking for a science-based profession."</p>
<p>Shakeel Bhatti is a science-minded individual who also wanted to work with people and chose pharmacy to meet both needs.</p>
<p>"I've always been a social scientist," says Bhatti, who owns Murrayville Family Pharmacy in Langley. "I like people and I like science -- I think most pharmacists are like that."</p>
<p>Bhatti has been in the business for 23 years and has worked in community and hospital pharmacies.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, he jumped at an opportunity to own his own pharmacy and has now expanded to three locations in Langley.</p>
<p>While he enjoys the complexity of managing his patients' prescriptions, it's the relationships that make his work most satisfying.</p>
<p>"With every prescription, I have to talk to my patients, spend time with them, get to know who they are -- people often stay with their pharmacist for a lifetime," Bhatti says. "We have to know our patients just like the doctors so we can advise them about their medications."</p>
<p>Bhatti's goal is to care for his patients from cradle to grave, and he looks forward to being able to offer vaccines later this year as part of his pharmacy's practice.</p>
<p>"It has always been a social profession, but in the past, most interaction with patients has been verbal. Now we're laying hands on people -- I think it's way overdue."</p>

<p>A new case of the H1N1 virus in Manitoba has prompted the chief of a nearby First Nations reserve to prepare plans to isolate the community until its members can be vaccinated. Chief Ken Chalmers of the Birdtail Sioux First Nation said he wants to isolate the community of 600 from the rest of the province, adding he's fearful of the havoc the virus could cause. "We know we're going to get some [H1N1] cases in our community but our plan is to do preventative work," he said.</p>

</p>
<p>A new case of the H1N1 virus in western Manitoba has prompted the chief of the nearby First Nations reserve to prepare plans to isolate the First Nation until its members can be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Chief Ken Chalmers of the Birdtail Sioux First Nation said he wants to isolate the community of 600 residents from the rest of the province, adding he's fearful of the havoc the virus could cause if it gets established.</p>
<p>"We know we're going to get some (H1N1) cases in our community but our plan is to do preventative work," Chalmers said.</p>
<p>Chalmers said the plan involves advising against travel in and out of the reserve and stockpiling enough food and medication to last until the entire community can be treated with the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Birdtail Sioux First Nation is located about 20 kilometres east of the Saskatchewan border, 40 kilometres north of Virden off Provincial Highway 83.</p>
<p>Chalmers said a band member who lives in nearby Birtle was diagnosed with the H1N1 virus in the middle of August. The patient, a young man of 21 or 22 years of age, disobeyed his doctor's orders to refrain from travelling and went back to the reserve.</p>
<p>"It was a mild case. He spent some time with his family here on the reserve, against his doctor's orders," Chalmers said. The family was isolated for seven days and there was no sign the virus had spread, he said.</p>
<p>He said there are 21 pregnant women in the community and 140 school-aged children. Chalmers said he's also considering closing the community school.</p>
<p>"We know the virus will spread quickly throughout the community if it gets into the school," Chalmers said. "I don't know why the school opened. We're rolling the dice with our children."</p>
<p>Manitoba Health said there have been 36 new cases of H1N1 since the middle of July, and 21 of them confirmed for the month of August. However, a spokeswoman said Manitoba would not confirm that one of those cases occurred in Birtle.</p>
<p>Chalmers said he doesn't believe that the H1N1 vaccine will be readily available until December.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mexico from A to Z; After a rough year in tourism, holiday mecca ready to shine</b>
</div><div>Andrew Mccredie </div>
<div>For Canwest News Service</div>
<div>1694 words</div><div>19 September 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist </div>
</p>
<p>Premier Gordon Campbell would do well to headhunt a public-relations person or two from Tourism Mexico.</p>
<p>After all, can there be anything who has suffered the slings and arrows of misfortune more in the past year than the Latin American country's tourism industry?</p>
<p>The industry's struggles make the B.C. Liberals' ballooning deficit and deflating approval-rating issues seem pretty tame by comparison. First, a worldwide economic downturn of unprecedented scope decimated the number of international travellers visiting the country; then a tiny Mexican village became ground zero for a swine-flu pandemic; and now hurricanes and all-around nasty weather batters its Pacific coastline.</p>
<p>Once the skies clear,</p>
<p>just as they have for centuries, the Mexican people will rebuild and come back better and stronger than ever.</p>
<p>As the industry heads into an all-important winter season, an improving global economic outlook should help their effort, as should airfare/accommodation deals too good for Canadian travellers to pass up.</p>
<p>If that's not enough, here's a list from A to Z of what the country has to offer.</p>
<p>- Archeology</p>
<p>Get in touch with your inner Indiana Jones at any number of archeological sites, featuring pyramids, caves, lost cities and sacred sacrificial bogs. Catch one of the ancient wonders of the New World at Chichen Itza, especially during the spring or fall equinoxes when the sun's light creates a slithering serpent descending the Temple of Kukulkan. Simply otherworldly.</p>
<p>- Beaches</p>
<p>Of course, reading about ancient civilizations is almost as good as being there, and there's no better place to soak up some scholarship and the sun than a Mexican beach. My personal favourites run along the Pacific Ocean, as surf big and small is never far away, and there's nothing like falling asleep to the sound of rolling waves.</p>
<p>- Cancun/Cabo</p>
<p>The bona fide Spring Break capitals of Mexico --if not the world -- the</p>
<p>double shot of Cancun and Cabo San Lucas is party central from January through May. Tens of thousands of students descend on the beaches and bars of these built-to-party resorts to blow off semester stress.</p>
<p>- Diego Rivera</p>
<p>Just as the Group of Seven's stark, desolate style defines the Canadian experience, Diego Rivera's paintings define Mexico's. Much of his great works are found throughout the world's top museums and galleries. However, Mexico City's Museo Dolores Olmedo is home to a treasured Rivera collection and one well worth a visit.</p>
<p>- Ecotourism</p>
<p>Sure it's a rather contrived buzzword, but ecotourism is a vibrant part of Mexico's tourism business, and judging from the ever-increasing number of operators going green, it isn't going away anytime soon. One of the best tours is the Sian Ka'an Biosphere, located on the Mayan Riviera in the largest protected area in the Mexican Caribbean.</p>
<p>- Festivals/fiestas</p>
<p>If there's one thing</p>
<p>Mexicans love to do, it is party, and the nation's</p>
<p>calendar is littered with fiestas. Festivals large and small take place throughout the year and throughout the country. You've still got time to book a flight to</p>
<p>Mexico City to catch El Día de los Muertos, the spooky Day of the Dead festival, on Nov. 2 in the city's Mixquic suburb. Once a village in its own right, it retains its rural roots and its Day of the Dead celebration is said to be one of the most colourful.</p>
<p>- Golf</p>
<p>The game of golf's global explosion the past two decades has left an indelible imprint on Mexico, with some 150 courses scattered throughout the country. For a memorable golf holiday, check out El Tamarindo Beach & Golf Resort, between Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta in a 825-hectare nature preserve. The thing about this luxury resort is even if you don't golf, you'll be blown away by the lush and undeveloped setting.</p>
<p>- H1N1</p>
<p>Taking a page or two from Tourism Canada's playbook following the SARS outbreak of 2003, Mexico has been on full damage control since spring, when the so-called swine flu devastated the all-important tourism business. The upshot? Great deals for Canadian travellers. And wash your hands.</p>
<p>- Isla Mujeres</p>
<p>Located a dozen kilometres from the party capital of Mexico, this tranquil island couldn't be more</p>
<p>different from the nearby Spring Break mecca of</p>
<p>Cancun. Just seven kilometres long and 650 metres wide, Isla Mujeres is a great place to chill out for a day or totally unwind for a week.</p>
<p>- Jalapeño</p>
<p>The little chili that launched a million heartburns is cultivated in a number of places in Mexico, but the Papaloapan River basin is where it was traditionally produced by the townspeople of Xalapa.</p>
<p>&gt; From Page C1</p>
<p>- Kissing</p>
<p>Latin American countries are renowned for their homegrown lovers, but its not difficult for visitors to Mexico to find a little love in the air. Long a honeymoon destination, the country is ripe for romance.</p>
<p>- Lime</p>
<p>What is it about putting a lime in a pint that makes even a rainy night in a Vancouver lounge seem a little bit of Mexico? Nearly 15 per cent of the world's limes come from Mexico, and with the fruit growing virtually everywhere in the country.</p>
<p>- Mayan Riviera</p>
<p>Few stretches of waterfront anywhere in the world offer the diverse range of experiences that this 132-kilometre tourist corridor does. There are Mayan ruins in Tulum at one end, at the other a Hooters restaurant in Cancun; there are all-inclusive luxury resorts just minutes from the quaint seaside town of Playa del Carmen; and there are five-star restaurants where a dinner jacket is required and beachside stands that serve you barefoot.</p>
<p>- Pesos</p>
<p>With the loonie translating to roughly 12 pesos currently, coupled with the fact the country's reeling tourist industry has slashed prices across the board, there's plenty of value for the Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>- National Palace</p>
<p>Built more than a century before the Palace of Versailles, the National Palace in Mexico City sits on a site that has served as the seat of power since the Aztec Empire. Fittingly, the main stairwell mural painted by Diego Rivera is entitled The Epic of the Mexican People.</p>
<p>- Oaxaca</p>
<p>The Free and Sovereign State of Oaxaca has more than 250 kilometres of accessible beaches, but it's the colonial architecture in the capital city of Oaxaca that brings camera-toting tourists to this Pacific Coast state by the planeload.</p>
<p>- Quesadillas</p>
<p>There's not a Vancouver taphouse worth its salsa that doesn't have this Mexican dish on the menu, but as the old saying goes, "Ain't nothing like the real thing, amigo." Best one I ever had was at an outdoor restaurant in the busy town centre of Manzanillo.</p>
<p>- Riviera Nayarit</p>
<p>Located just north of Puerto Vallarta on the Pacific Coast, this new luxury resort community has quickly, and somewhat quietly, become the place to play golf in Mexico. No fewer than six championship courses are within an hour's drive of one another, and later this month the Jack Nicklaus-designed Punta Mita Pacifico course hosts a Canadian Professional Golf Tour event, the Riviera Nayarit Classic.</p>
<p>- Scuba/surfing</p>
<p>From the world-class diving sites off Cozumel to the Pacific Ocean swells off Puerto Escondido, Mexico is heaven for those who like to dive below the waves and those who like to ride them. Most resorts offer scuba certification courses for beginners, while surf schools can be found up and down the Pacific coastline.</p>
<p>- Tourism</p>
<p>As integral to Mexico's economy as natural resources are to Canada's, international tourism to the country has taken a battering the past year for reasons it can't control. But with more than one out of every 10 Mexican employed directly in the industry, the country is pouring resources into promoting itself around the world.</p>
<p>- UNESCO</p>
<p>Mexico ranks first in the Americas and eighth in the world for the number of sites recognized in recent years by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. No fewer than 26 sites have UNESCO endorsement for their historical, cultural and natural significance.</p>
<p>- Veracruz</p>
<p>Home to the highest point in Mexico -- the 5,363-metre volcano Citaltépetl -- the state of Veracruz is also home to the oldest still-standing Catholic chapel built in the Americas (in the village of La Antigua).</p>
<p>- Whale watching</p>
<p>The Pacific Ocean off Mexico is a major whale highway, and an increasing number of tour operators are providing opportunities for tourists get close to these creatures.</p>
<p>Mid-December to March is prime whale-watching season, and with some tour operators using spotter planes to locate the massive marine mammals, your chances are good.</p>
<p>- Xcaret Eco Park</p>
<p>Imagine if <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> built a Mayan ecological theme park and you'll have some idea what this place is all about.</p>
<p>Featuring the flora and fauna of the Mexican southeast, including sea turtles, manatees and spider monkeys, the main attraction is a massive water park that lets you swim with dolphins and other marine life. Great for families.</p>
<p>- Yucatan peninsula</p>
<p>Rich in history and culture, the Yucatan peninsula was home to the ancient Maya and boasts two of the greatest archeological sites in all of Mexico -- Chichen Itza and Tulum.</p>
<p>- Zihuatanejo</p>
<p>This laid-back Pacific coast community is part fishing village, part beach resort and is the ideal place to recharge for a week or so.</p>
<p>For a great dining experience, check out Coconuts. And if the urge strikes for some Jell-O shooters and techno, the bright lights of Ixtapa are just a cab ride away.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Medical-care gaps worry villagers; Ahousaht fears H1N1 overload</b>
</div><div>Richard Watts </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>572 words</div><div>19 September 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist </div>
</p>
<p>Natives in the isolated community of Ahousaht are concerned their three days a week without medical care could become a problem in dealing with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Curtis Dick, Ahousaht deputy chief, said band leadership has voiced concerns to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth tribal council, which represents 14 different First Nations and administers Ahousaht's clinic, open Monday to Thursday.</p>
<p>"It is a major concern because we are an isolated community," said Dick.</p>
<p>On days a nurse or doctor isn't there to administer anti-viral medication, like Tamiflu, the people of Ahousaht must take an air ambulance to a hospital, or the 45-minute water taxi to Tofino.</p>
<p>Ahousaht, home to 800 to 1,000 people, saw about 100 cases of people suffering flu-like illnesses last month. The cases were largely mild and most of the patients have since recovered.</p>
<p>Dick says his village has coped well with the H1N1 outbreak so far. "We are an isolated community but we adapt and we make do."</p>
<p>Ahousaht is one of four First Nations communities of the 51 on Vancouver Island to experience laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>Another is Beecher Bay -- between Metchosin and Sooke -- which on Wednesday became the first community on Vancouver Island to record a death due to H1N1, the sixth fatality in the province.</p>
<p>Health officials have said the victim suffered previous aggravating health conditions. They refused to be specific, but respiratory infections such as asthma and diabetes and even obesity have long been identified as complicating factors.</p>
<p>Dr. Charmaine Enns, a medical health officer for the Vancouver Island Health Authority, said planning began for an influenza pandemic -- including consultations with remote First Nations communities -- as far back as 2005.</p>
<p>Part of that planning included distribution of emergency medical supplies such as the anti-viral drug Tamiflu, gloves and masks in isolated communities such as Ahousaht. Central distribution sites were also set up, including the health centre in Zeballos, which serves surrounding villages.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall, B.C.'s chief medical health officer, has said the province has enough anti-viral medicine to treat a million people, which he believes will be more than enough.</p>
<p>But the hospital in Tofino has only 10 beds and couldn't handle a large influx of patients who needed help with breathing.</p>
<p>Enns noted that unlike other emergencies, such as earthquakes, influenza outbreaks are long, drawn-out affairs and it's difficult to predict what the virus will do.</p>
<p>Enns said one of the biggest health-care hurdles facing First Nations communities is social issues such as inadequate housing. "Housing is an issue for every health indicator."</p>
<p>Karen Bartlett, associate professor in the school of environmental health at the University of British Columbia, which has studied the link between respiratory ailments and poor native housing, said reserves are ripe for a flu outbreak. Native houses are often inappropriately designed, poorly situated and badly constructed. Moisture is trapped, mould grows and occupants develop conditions like asthma.</p>
<p>"Once you have an illness going around, particularly one like H1N1, it's much more likely you are going to catch it," said Bartlett. "It's suspended in the air."</p>

<p>People of all ages -- from elders to infants in strollers -- participated in the AIDS Walk for Life in Regina on Friday.</p>
<p>"We're quite grateful and we feel really blessed that there's a lot of support in the community for the walk today," said Margaret Akan, CEO of All Nations Hope AIDS Network (ANHAN).</p>
<p>She's been working to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS for the past 20 years, but said HIV/AIDS tends not to get much support.</p>
<p>"There's still a lot of stigma, ignorance and discrimination that's associated with this disease," said Akan.</p>
<p>However, she was pleased to have representation from the City of Regina, File Hills Qu'Appelle Tribal Council, businesses and other community organizations.</p>
<p>FHQTC Tribal Vice-Chairman Myke Agecoutay said it's time for all levels of government to step forward and work towards addressing the issue of HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>"Non-profit organizations do a lot of the hard work. They do a lot of the front-line services and they often rely on provincial funding and federal funding -- and often funding is very minimal," said Agecoutay.</p>
<p>He said everyone needs to call upon governments to do more to combat the disease because it's becoming more widespread.</p>
<p>"It's affecting more people, right now, than the H1N1 virus and that's getting more attention across the country," said Agecoutay. "AIDS and HIV has been here for decades and we don't give it that same press time. We have to do more as communities."</p>
<p>Akan agrees that the community as a whole needs to become more aware of the disease because it's something ANHAN has been doing for years. She said those who have been working in this field have known for a long time what populations were most at risk.</p>
<p>"We know that we're at the tip of the iceberg. There's much more people who don't get tested," Akan said. "To us, HIV/AIDS is a symptom of many, many other things. It's a symptom of poverty, homelessness, addiction to many other things that need to be addressed in our community. We can only do it as a community -- together."</p>
<p>Delora Parisian, executive director of Aboriginal Family Service Centre (AFSC), also believes that the community needs to come together and support one another, particularly aboriginal organizations.</p>
<p>"We really need to realize the importance of tackling these issues that our people face, together," said Parisian.</p>
<p>She said that representatives from AFSC's five programs participated in the walk along with AFSC families.</p>
<p>"(HIV/AIDS) affects the family, the community, so it's important that our kids grow with an awareness of it as well," said Parisian.</p>

<p>Steve Johnson is addicted to soccer and a winner. He is not afraid to fight for what he wants. And his wife takes advantage of him.</p>
<p>I've known him for some 15 years and I have seen inklings of some of this, but it did not become so clear until we sat in the stands at the University of Ottawa Sports Complex on Thursday and talked about the women's soccer program he runs with such remarkable success.</p>
<p>That complex wasn't even there when Johnson arrived in Ottawa with his wife, Jane Allain, a lawyer, in 1989. He was already a soccer coach, having run women's squads at both the Mount Allison and Moncton universities. So it was no surprise he went knocking at the door of the Carleton University sports department. No vacancies.</p>
<p>At U of O, he was "absolutely shocked" to discover there was no soccer at all -- for men or women. "Soccer, for me, is the universal sport," he says. "This must have been one of the very, very few that had none of it."</p>
<p>That was about to change.</p>
<p>Johnson found himself a coaching job with the Nepean United's under-18 women's team. There were future Canadian internationals on this squad, many of whom asked him to coach them as a club team when they went to the U of O.</p>
<p>But it was varsity status Johnson was after. He had fine athletes who were about to miss the chance to become top quality soccer players. As a club team, they were beating the likes of York University, which was No 1 in Canada at the time. "We had the quality to compete, but we didn't have varsity status."</p>
<p>University authorities eventually agreed to make women's soccer the next to be granted varsity status, an overdue move when you consider 65 per cent of the school was female and probably 85 per cent of the sanctioned sports were for men.</p>
<p>Then the men's golf team was selected ahead of soccer. So Johnson, his captain Vickie White and others got tough. Really tough. They threatened to go to the Human Rights Commission, to call a news conference and to reveal all on an upcoming interview on CBC Radio's Inside Track. That was a Friday. The school Senate went into emergency mode. Women's soccer was sanctioned on the Monday.</p>
<p>And Johnson has hardly looked back.</p>
<p>In the first year, 1994, Ottawa was named the nation's top team in early October. Inexperience let them down in the playoffs. The same thing happened 12 months later, but in their third year U of O's women won it all -- national champions.</p>
<p>Since then, there have been four silver and two bronze medals at nationals, along with six Ontario titles.</p>
<p>He is shy to admit an ability to bring out the best in players. "Our advantage is that the 11 on the field are being pushed by those on the bench," he says. "Everyone wants to be in the starting lineup. That's what creates the motivational atmosphere. If you are not serious about your soccer here, it is hard to last because players and coaches will be pushing for that."</p>
<p>To achieve at this level year after year requires serious commitment. So Johnson has been particularly pleased that his wife has been equally busy working on H1N1 in the Justice Department. "That's good because she doesn't bug me about the time I put into soccer."</p>
<p>Mind you, she knows how to make use of her husband's addiction.</p>
<p>"In 1994, I went on a FIFA course for a week in Hamilton," Johnson says. "She calls me and asks if I'm sitting down. 'No, but I have a beer in my hand,' I said. 'I've bought a house,' she said.</p>
<p>"When I went to Bejing to coach Canada at the World University Games, she called and asked me to pick a colour from ones she mentioned. I picked beige. 'Good. I bought a car,' she said. Then it was a new kitchen while I was in Turkey."</p>
<p>It seems like grabbing life runs in the Johnson family. In November two years ago, mom and dad took six-month leaves of absence, took 10-year-old Alex out of school and flew off around the world. All through Asia and Australasia, and home via Vancouver.</p>
<p>Why take on such a journey? Allain had had a multiple sclerosis scare four years before and she wanted to travel the world without her husband having to push her in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Not that he wouldn't have done it. Steve Johnson always seems to meet life's challenges head on.</p>

<p>Here are what qualify as flu-like symptoms this fall: Fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, fatigue. A significant number of people who have been infected with the swine flu virus, say health agencies, have also have reported diarrhea and vomiting.</p>
<p>Based on that assessment, you're probably thinking, "Hey, I might have swine flu right now!" And if not you, then certainly someone in your family. Barely a week goes by in any household when someone isn't experiencing at least a touch of one of these. A runny nose? De rigueur for fall and winter among the under-six set. Headache? A favourite excuse when a test's in the offing.</p>
<p>But in this age of pandemic awareness, parents have been asked to watch for these signs and keep children at home when the symptoms show up.</p>
<p>While that might make sense from a public health perspective, it's proving difficult for the working masses. Already parents are whispering about children who returned to school one day after being sent home with a fever, or who coughed their way through hockey tryouts. In normal times, sotto voce discussions of this sort might be characterized as PTA-grade gossip. But as we wait for the flu pandemic to descend in its full, promised power, concern about how to care for your kids -- and how others are caring for theirs -- adds a new layer to the heavy blanket of angst most parents carry.</p>
<p>Any working parent knows too well the guilt-laden dilemma faced the morning a child wakes up slightly under the weather.</p>
<p>Serious illness, especially when there's a fever, is an easy call. But a cough or runny nose? They can last weeks. Are you really expected to stay home that long? Your employer, who is unlikely to have an H1N1 strategy or a plan to manage in your absence, doesn't want you to.</p>
<p>Add to that the fact that many H1N1 symptoms overlap with regular seasonal illnesses, including the common cold. Most doctors aren't testing for swine flu, so parents may not know exactly what their children have. As the season wears on, they could find themselves staying home every few weeks with kids who display mild symptoms. As much as one tries to be extra-cautious, no one wants to be seen as the employee who cries "swine."</p>
<p>Consulting official guidelines does not always help. Most public policy plans don't specify how long to wait for symptoms to dissipate. A letter from the Ottawa-Carleton public school board, which went home with students with a raft of other papers at the start of the year, suggested students stay away from class "until they are symptom-free for 24 hours."</p>
<p>But does that mean all symptoms? Not according to Ottawa Public Health, which in its Aug. 19 letter to parents said, "Your child may resume his or her regular activities when he or she no longer has a fever and is feeling better." Cough alone, says the health agency, is no reason to stay home.</p>
<p>That is unlikely to sit well with many parents, who will be uncomfortable at the thought of their child's classmate coughing or sneezing up a storm, even if they don't have a fever. This is especially true in light of research reported this week at an American Society for Microbiology conference. The study suggests people can continue to be contagious after their fevers break, leading some health experts to believe children should be at home until they're cough-free.</p>
<p>In an era where parents are accused of being overly anxious about every aspect of their children's lives, it would be easy to dismiss these escalating concerns as just so much parental hand-wringing. But that would be unfair. Unlike most seasonal flus, children and young adults are disproportionately susceptible to H1N1 and are statistically more likely to become seriously ill.</p>
<p>Although current evidence indicates the overwhelming majority of those who contract swine flu will suffer mild symptoms, when it comes to their children, parents have close to zero-tolerance for risk. (Last weekend, one woman called in to a U.S. radio show to demand her 23-year-old son and his friends get a vaccine ahead of healthy 50- and 60-year-olds.)</p>
<p>As more and more children become sick, you are unlikely to hear a parent give a balanced historical perspective on the pandemic along the lines of, "Well, it could have been much worse. It could have been akin to the 1918 pandemic that killed millions and millions." No, you are more likely to hear an overwrought mother complain that her son caught the flu from so-and-so, who was coughing last week for three days before he was sent home from school with a fever.</p>
<p>Under other circumstances, other kids are usually none of your business. But in the realm of communicable diseases, suddenly other parents' decisions become your problem. That's why they call it public health.</p>
<p>So how to live your private life, while having the proper amount of respect for the public? How do we choose between skipping work to stay home with sick kids, or facing the wrath of other parents by sending them back before they're "symptom-free," whatever that means?</p>
<p>It's hard to find anyone who knows; even the UN's World Health Organization seems at a loss. Last week, the WHO suggested the best way to curb the flu's spread is to close schools "very early in an outbreak, ideally before one per cent of the population falls ill."</p>
<p>On the other hand, said the organization, when authorities are making those decisions, they need to be aware of the economic and social costs "that can be disproportionately high when viewed against potential benefits."</p>
<p>So the best the globe's leading health body can offer is vague advice about balancing irreconcilable values. And if they can't figure out how to balance the health of children against the necessity of work, it's hard to know how we mere parents are supposed to make the call.</p>

</div><div>KAREN von HAHN </div>

<p>Did you catch the latest? According to a recent study by social scientists Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler, the behaviours of our nearest and dearest might be contagious. At least, that's been the media's take.</p>
<p>“Are Your Friends Making You Fat?” asked last week's <span class="companylink">New York Times Magazine</span>, in scarily chubby letters on its cover – nothing being more terrifying than the notion that there's something lurking out there that might blimp you up a jeans size. That's not to mention the lightning bolt it must be for the skinny tall girls who for years, have made sure to surround themselves with short, plump girlfriends as a living, eating (hence flattering) backdrop.</p>
<p>Christakis and Fowler's finding, that social behaviours such as smoking, alcoholism and obesity tend to cluster in groups, should not be surprising. After all, we are traditionally social animals. People do tend to eat, smoke and drink – together. They also seek out the company of others who are interested in doing the same thing. The discovery, in my admittedly unscientific opinion, is akin to the kind of research that demonstrates the earth-shattering notion that, gasp, our minds and our bodies are linked.</p>
<p>What is more fascinating to me, particularly in this time of H1N1 fear, when we all have to be up on the newest <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> video that has gone “viral,” is how much we appear to be obsessed with the idea of contagion. And how much we use the language of illness and the fear of contact with others as a design premise in the products we use, and the way we have chosen to live.</p>
<p>There's Purell on your desk, Purell in the library, in the grocery store and in the halls at school. Have you seen those people with tiny Purell holders attached to their backpacks? Well, no matter the research that indicates washing your hands with plain old soap and water is probably just as effective, or the revelation that hand sanitizers may not eliminate all viruses, sales of anti-microbials such as Purell are up 80 per cent in the past two years, according to the British-based Cosmetic Toiletry and Perfumery Association. Purell has sold out in Mexico and in South Korea with each swine flu announcement. Fear of contagion is such a fashion now that the latest sanitizers have gone boutique: Courtesy of Bath & Bodyworks, you can now buy cute little designer ones with scents like White Citrus, Coconut Lime and Cucumber Melon.</p>
<p>I once caught an episode of The Tyra Banks Show, in which the former supermodel wrinkled her pretty nose at giant projections of the bacteria swimming around in her guests' makeup bags, while the studio audience screamed, “Ewwww,” in collective delight. Now, thanks to a new product called BeautySoClean developed by a Hollywood makeup artist, all you have to do to keep your blush and eyeliner free of gross-out life forms is to blast them with a quick, refreshing spritz.</p>
<p>Speaking of showers, apparently they aren't clean enough, either. The story all over the news this week was that about 20 per cent of showerheads may harbour “significant levels” of mycobaterium avium, which has been linked to pulmonary disease. Never mind that those designer vegetable washes have been shown to be no more effective than water from your kitchen faucet, soon we will be showering ourselves with the human equivalent.</p>
<p>In the opinion of celebrity germophobes such as Howie Mandel and Donald Trump, who reputedly refuse to shake hands or touch the down button on an elevator, this world we live in is rife with the possibility of contagion. Given Christakis and Fowler's notion of behavioural trends as viruses, apparently these extreme paranoids are no longer being seen as borderline crazies, but rather as trendsetters in a coming wave.</p>
<p>After all, we already live and work in hermetically sealed bubbles. There is little gathering over the water cooler, since fewer and fewer of us actually work together in offices. Most of our daily contact with everyone from our co-workers to our bank managers to our families is via the more hygienic e-mail, or over the phone. Our community is virtual: Any buzz that's happening is safely contained to our screens.</p>
<p>In what now passes for a café, we each sit at our own tables, texting in messages to others who aren't there in front of us instead of actually talking, which risks an exchange of something gross and human, like spittle. Visiting cities and museums, we are safely plugged into our own personal tours. When we are forced into exposed situations such as public transit or commercial air travel, we seal ourselves off as much as possible with our iPods and our Kindles. Wireless mobility has been sold to us as a way to stay connected, but increasingly we use it as a talismanic protection against the possibility of infection – a wreath of digital garlic with which we can isolate ourselves.</p>
<p>Whether or not our fear stems from the fact that there are more and more of us ewwy, bacteria-breeding life forms on this planet, is it possible that what we fear isn't only contagion but connection? In short, that what we are really afraid of is ourselves.</p>

<p>Mexico has been hit with 1,341 new swine flu cases since Monday, bringing the total to 26,338 ahead of the usual autumn flu season, health officials said yesterday.</p>
<p>The Health Ministry said one more person died from the virus between Monday and Thursday, bringing the death toll to 218 in the country where the virus first emerged in April before becoming a pandemic. In late August, Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova estimated that nearly one million people could be infected by the virus during the winter, out of Mexico's total population of 100 million.</p>

</p>
<p>Canadian officials are being vague about why this country is conspicuously absent from a list of developed nations donating one-tenth of their pandemic vaccine to countries that don't have access to the shots.</p>
<p>The nine-country initiative, announced Thursday by U.S. President Barack Obama, involves the U.S., Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France, Italy, Switzerland, Brazil and Norway.</p>
<p>"At this time, Canada is doing an analysis of various options to support the provision of H1N1 vaccine to developing countries," the Public Health Agency of Canada said yesterday in an e-mailed response to questions about why it hasn't joined the initiative.</p>
<p>The decision by the nine countries, some of the largest users of flu vaccine globally, was hailed by the World Health Organization as a commitment "to fairness in the sharing of a scarce resource."</p>
<p>The nine have said they will donate 10 per cent on an ongoing basis as vaccine becomes available. Countries that want donated vaccine will have to assume all liability and release donor countries, manufacturers and the WHO from any claims in the event that adverse events are linked to its use, the WHO says.</p>
<p>Canada has ordered 50.4 million doses of pandemic vaccine from GSK, which is making the product at its facility in Ste-Foy, Que. The order was placed when it was thought people might need two doses apiece to be protected against the new H1N1 virus. A number of recently published studies have revealed one shot should protect most adolescents, teens and adults.</p>
<p>Polls have suggested fewer than half of Canadians plan to get vaccinated. The lower-than-expected dosage need plus the potential soft demand means Canada may have many millions of unclaimed doses of vaccine.</p>

</div><div>By Bruce Owen    </div>
<div>989 words</div><div>19 September 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>A controversial plan to build a $2-billion hydro transmission line down the west side of the province might not be totally carved in stone thanks to political jockeying in the race to replace Premier Gary Doer.</p>
<p>NDP leadership hopeful Andrew Swan said Friday he would visit the 16 First Nations communities on the east side of the province in his first year as premier to hear what they think of the new power line -- a line many say if built down the east side of Lake Winnipeg will open up a largely forgotten part of the province.</p>
<p>"There's a very, very, very strong case based on the 80 meetings that were held on east-side communities -- again, I wasn't there -- but my understanding is those communities were unanimous in saying they did not want the line going down the east side," Swan said.</p>
<p>"That's a pretty strong case and it would be a strong hurdle for anyone -- anyone -- to ever change. And frankly, I don't think there would be grounds. But again, I'm not going to go into a First Nation and tell them we can't talk about hydro issues or development issues because if I'm a guest on their turf, they can talk about whatever they'd like, so we'll see how that goes."</p>
<p>Swan would not speculate on whether those discussions could lead to the line's route being changed.</p>
<p>"We would need to gather an awful lot of information and I expect that's what will happen as I travel to 16 different communities on the east side," he said.</p>
<p>Swan's opening of the door to revisit the Bipole III decision earned instant condemnation from the Tory opposition.</p>
<p>"It really is a breath-taking reversal in position," Tory Leader Hugh McFadyen said. "He needs to understand that if you spend two years defending your position and then reverse it in the middle of a leadership campaign, how can you expect anyone to take you seriously as leader?"</p>
<p>The Tories have long-lobbied for the shorter east-side route, saying it would be cheaper and create jobs for many people who live in the area.</p>
<p>Leadership contender Greg Selinger, the former minister responsible for <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>, said Bipole III is a done deal regardless of what Swan says. "We all ran in 2007 on not putting Bipole down the east side," he said. "That's the position of government today. That's the position of government tomorrow if I am leader."</p>
<p>Selinger said he did not want to comment on why Swan would raise Bipole III during a leadership contest.</p>
<p>"Let someone else figure it out," he said.</p>
<p>Swan made his comments moments after The Pas NDP MLA Frank Whitehead threw his support behind Swan's leadership bid. Whitehead's endorsement comes with a lot of clout. The former chief of the Opaskwayak Cree Nation was only elected in March and brings with him more than 1,100 party memberships, a key ingredient in determining the number of delegates that will go to the Oct. 17 leadership convention.</p>
<p>"My areas of concern always have been about economic development, education and training," Whitehead said. "The aboriginal people have to be involved in those plans. We have to be at the table when we're discussing the future."</p>
<p>Whitehead said it took him two days to determine which of the candidates to endorse.</p>
<p>Also at the podium was Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs Grand Chief Ron Evans, who didn't directly say his organization endorsed Swan, but that it supported Whitehead's endorsement of Swan.</p>
<p>"Frank had approached the assembly for support and the assembly has granted him that support for him to support Andrew Swan," Evans said.</p>
<p>Evans's endorsement of Whitehead came out of a meeting Friday of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, which was supposed to be only about H1N1 flu preparations, Norway House Cree Nation chief Marcel Balfour said.</p>
<p>Balfour said he was the only chief on the executive council to vote against Whitehead's endorsement, because it was improper for the assembly to be seen supporting one candidate over the other.</p>
<p>"I indicated that I thought it was inappropriate for us as chiefs to be engaged in partisan politics with the NDP, and I said that I did not come to the meeting to engage in such a decision," Balfour said.</p>
<p>Swan also said as premier he'd work more closely with aboriginal people on health, housing, education, resource development and treaty rights, including putting high schools in each community so young people don't have to leave their homes to continue their education.</p>

<p>In 2007, the Doer government announced it was building the 2,000-megawatt line down the west side of Lake Manitoba instead of down the east side of Lake Winnipeg, which is a shorter and cheaper route.</p>
<p>The $2-billion transmission line is to be built by 2017.</p>
<p>Bipole III is needed to make the delivery of electricity to southern Manitoba more reliable and to increase capacity for hydro needed to meet export demands south of the border. The existing two transmission lines run down from the north along the same corridor through the Interlake. Bipole III offers a third option, so that if something disables the two other lines, such as an ice storm or tornado, power will still flow.</p>
<p>Last year, the province tabled legislation to help protect the east side's boreal forest from development, paving the way for a UNESCO World Heritage site and effectively killing any chance of a power line down the east side. The East Side Traditional Lands Planning and Special Protected Areas Act became law in June.</p>

</p>
<p>So it sounds like an election has been averted again. There have been grumblings going on at Parliament Hill ever since the Conservatives took over back in 2006.</p>
<p>Because of the Conservatives are a minority, they need the support of another party in order to stay in power. So when there's a new session of Parliament, and a mandate is announced by the Tories, there better be a little something in it for everyone.</p>
<p>Well, I'm no expert at Canadian politics but it seems like we've been here before.</p>
<p>This time around threats of an election seem to have been put aside with the promise to make some increases in employment insurance benefits. It's a good issue to support, but I'm thinking next time around -- because there will be a next time -- our elected officials should try something different.</p>
<p>Why not make the deal-maker an aboriginal issue next time?</p>
<p>Surely with threats of a non-confidence vote we could get some real action on our behalf. Come on Liberals, come on NDP. Put your money where your mouth is.</p>
<p>We've got plenty of choices to pick from, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Education -- or to be more precise, First Nation education deficits -- could easily be a major issue that could topple the government. It could be increased funding for the post-secondary school that will mean an increase in educated First Nations people joining the workforce, or something as simple as increased school construction on reserves.</p>
<p>Places like Manto Sipi Cree Nation, or God's River, in northern Manitoba have been waiting for a new school since 1987. It seems the school has been closed because of fire code violations so the kids up there started the school year in a canopy tent. They are taught in rotating classes because there isn't enough room for everyone.</p>
<p>And they aren't alone. Many First Nations need schools or have schools that need fixing.</p>
<p>Then there's the housing crisis in First Nations communities across the country. It's the same deal as the schools; there aren't enough houses to go around, and the houses that are around are cramped and need fixing.</p>
<p>And don't give me the old "Ottawa spends $9 billion a year on First Nations" argument either. A huge chunk of that money -- owed to First Nations for this land -- is eaten up by Indian Affairs bureaucracy and very little makes it to the average family. That's the problem.</p>
<p>Or here's something that could work. How about someone calling for election based on the fact that this H1N1 preparedness is looking like it is being mishandled on reserves?</p>
<p>Despite the repeated message by the feds that Health Canada has a well thought out plan on what to do when swine flu hits First Nations, that plan has yet to be made public. It is troubling that one of the most vulnerable groups that will be hit by this pandemic does not have a clear idea of how it is going to be dealt with.</p>
<p>Even more troubling are the dozens of body bags among the hand sanitizers, and other flu kit supplies that showed up on three northern Manitoba First Nations this week. Now if that isn't a hot button topic to stir up threats of an election, I don't know what is.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canada must immunize itself</b>
</div><div>Conrad Black    </div>

</p>
<p>As regular readers are aware, this column is written from outside Canada and I don't have access to an unlimited wealth of sources on that country. With that pusillanimous qualifier, I must return to an old tilting yard and view with alarm the tendency to authoritarian laws in pursuit of apparently desirable goals, and to attempted peer censorship of public references to inconvenient facts.</p>
<p>It would not be appropriate to comment on the pending case against former Ontario attorney-general Michael Bryant in the fatal road rage incident. For obvious reasons, I am more reluctant than most people to rush to judgment on the basis of the media's agreed version of events.</p>
<p>Though I presume him to be innocent, Mr. Bryant's discomfort does illuminate the illogic of some of his legislative brainwaves in his former position. Should we not all have figured out when he asserted the right of the state to destroy automobiles deemed to be too powerful, even if they had never exceeded a speed limit, that there was some doubt about this man's suitability for high public office? This took the pre-emptive strike to undreamed of depths of proactivity. An exceptionally fast automobile is often a magnificent machine. I'm not very mechanical and I prefer luxury to speed in a car. But where did this idea arise that an atavistic destruction of valuable property was an appropriate remedy to preconceived driving infractions by unspecifiable wrongdoers?</p>
<p>We are all unlicensed psychiatrists, and the former attorney general's promise to "crush the parts" of such an unoffending but muscular automobile was belligerent juvenilism, with a subliminal message of emasculation. From this distance I fear for the country's ancient and vital sense of moderation. If a proper judicial process finds Bryant guilty, I would strenuously defend both his right not to have his automobile crushed, and the right of an inanimate automobile not to be vandalized to scrap by the Ontario government just because its owner allegedly drove it at speed down a crowded sidewalk. From here, this looks like Spitzerism, another incidence of the virulent pandemic of American prosecutorial swine flu. Canada must immunize itself.</p>
<p>It is heartening that the new Ontario Conservative leader, and likely the next premier, Tim Hudak, wishes to abolish the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal. As has been amply demonstrated by Mark Steyn and Ezra Levant in their travails with them, these human rights commissions have excessive power. In the name of trying to redress the unpleasantnesses of some licit behaviour and of nature's uneven distribution of human talents, they try to squeeze freedom of expression and action, to accommodate the sensibilities of special purpose victim groups. Charlatans have swarmed snorting out of the undergrowth claiming unspeakable prodigies of persecution and "disrespect."</p>
<p>And we seem to have reached the point where noting the existence of a quality such as a woman being objectively pretty is deemed to imply that such person lacks other qualities more evidently relevant to performing important functions, and to slight (in this example) all women who are physically less well-favoured.</p>
<p>I was prompted to reflect on this by a letter to Maclean's objecting to a reference to the Alberta dissident politician Danielle Smith as "not unattractive." Why, it was asked with crackling indignation, was this point made? The answer is because it is germane to the prospects of a politician, and is of legitimate public interest.</p>
<p>No one seriously pretends that someone's appearance has nothing to do with comparative electability. Should John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon have worn party masks or dressed up as Klansmen for the 1960 televised presidential debates? Radio listeners thought Nixon won, and television viewers thought Kennedy won, because Nixon was haggard and prone to perspire, and was recovering from a painful knee accident, and didn't resort to JFK's pre-debate pick-me-up of the importation of random women to pleasure him professionally. (The Kennedys probably stole the election anyway and the origins of Camelot, which expired with Ted Kennedy last month, are lost in the mists of American political chicanery and corruption.)</p>
<p>The political success of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chilean President Michelle</p>
<p>Bachelet, and in her time, Israeli premier Golda Meir, show that successful female political leaders don't have to be bombshells like Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, or pleasingly sultry like Argentine President Christina Kirchner, or even Indira Gandhi and Margaret Thatcher, who were, in Maclean's cautious parlance, "not unattractive."</p>
<p>The point is, appearance, like intelligence, eloquence and quickness in repartee, is a combination of genetic luck and personal application. Voters will put whatever weight they want on different factors. Playing fields should not be levelled by pre-assuring an equalized result. No one yet contends that Roosevelt and Landon, Reagan and Carter, Obama and McCain, Trudeau and Stanfield should all have spoken through scramblers during their election campaigns -- which would have made them sound like the voices in our automobiles that tell us to put on our seat belts -- so as to equalize their oratorical impacts.</p>
<p>As long as affirmative action does not become counter-discriminating, I am something of a feminist, and have a natural bias in favour of female candidates, corporate executives and clergy. This is not condescending chivalry, but because men have made such a mess of most things, women, who are at least as intelligent, should be given a full chance to do better. I thought Hillary Clinton the best of the U. S. presidential nomination finalists last year, and prefer the wife of the President of France to the President, and the mother-in-law of the leader of the British opposition, Lady Astor, to the actual Conservative leader, David Cameron. (Neither is contending for these positions.)</p>
<p>The world's leading rights activist is Aung San Suu Kyi, and the vanguard of resistance to the regression of Islam are the two women in Sudan and Malaysia, who having been sentenced to be caned for, respectively, wearing trousers and having a glass of beer, have bravely demanded that the sentences be carried out in public and televised. The Sudanese woman, a distinguished United Nations aid administrator, has sent out engraved invitations to the imposition of her sentence. Both regimes have backed away and used Ramadan as an excuse to prevaricate. They are caught between their cowardly appeasement of Islamic extremists and their desire not be exposed as antediluvian morons to the whole world. Nothing else has worked with these fanatics, and these are not naughty Victorian schoolchildren facing the birch; they are adult women accepting what are generally fierce beatings in a valiant cause.</p>
<p>From what I read, Karen Stintz should be the next mayor of Toronto. It is time for a change from someone who thinks being routed by striking garbagemen is a triumph of municipal statesmanship. Ms. Stintz always seems sensible. That, in the one picture of her this newspaper runs, she looks like Israeli opposition leader Tzipi Livny, is a plus point. (I have never laid eyes on Ms. Stintz, and have no idea if she would distinguish herself as mayor, but surely in the era of Boris Johnson and Michael Bloomberg, Toronto can do better than the incumbent.)</p>
<p>At a certain point, we have to trust in a sensible selection process, and when the selections have been made, whoever has been elevated should remember the limits of legislation and regulation. In general, the democratic system has flourished on the principle of maximizing individual liberty as long as it doesn't compromise the liberties of others.</p>
<p>It is always a temptation to adopt laws aimed at undesirable acts that have broadly negative consequences, like Prohibition, or seizing automobiles that could exceed a speed limit more easily than most cars. And it tempts some to try to ignore or repeal the uneven distribution of talent and allure. This is a first step on a down escalator that descends swiftly into uninhabitable nether regions.</p>

<p>Birthplaces of nachos, Caesar salad bite dust</p>
<p>Caesar's is dead. The Tijuana restaurant that popularized the Caesar salad has closed, an apparent victim of a tourism-dependent economy devastated by crime, drug violence and the swine flu.</p>
<p>The slump in visitors from the U.S. also seemed to have claimed another innovator - an eatery tied to the invention of nachos in the town of Piedras Negras, across the border from Eagle Pass, Tex.</p>
<p>Employees at Caesar's restaurant said yesterday the business shut down Monday. The restaurant had ties to the Tijuana spot where the dish is believed to have been invented in the 1920s, but had moved to a new location long ago.</p>
<p>Restaurant Moderno in Piedras Negras, the reputed birthplace of the nacho closed in June, a former employee confirmed yesterday. A waiter at the Moderno, Ignacio Anaya, was credited with inventing the corn chip, cheese and jalapeno dish. The name came from Anaya's nickname, Nacho.</p>

<p>Scores of bloodied and bandaged victims filled hospital beds after a suicide car bomber destroyed a two-storey, Shiite-owned hotel yesterday on the outskirts of Kohat, killing 29 people and wounding 55. Several buildings were destroyed or badly damaged.</p>
<p>The attack took place in the Shiite-dominated village of Usterzai, raising speculation it may have been a sectarian assault by Sunni extremists. It occurred just days before Muslims from both sects celebrate the end of Ramadan.</p>

<p>The order, effective for 10 days, prevents a second execution attempt on convicted killer Romell Broom from going forward as planned Tuesday. A defence motion to halt the execution permanently is to be heard Sept. 28.</p>

<p>President Mahinda Rajapaksa promised yesterday to send nearly 300,000 Tamil war refugees held in military-run camps back home in four months.</p>
<p>The government has said it can't send the displaced people home until their villages are cleared of mines and can't release those in the camps because of fears some may be rebel fighters.

<p>The Andalusia government says it will save about $3 million a year by having clerks use public transportation to deliver court papers to plaintiffs and defendants.

<div id="hd"><b>Healthy eating thwarted by pricey food, Canadians say; Good nutrition a top concern, beating fears over swine flu, public health care, study finds</b>
</div><div>Dana Flavelle    </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>376 words</div><div>19 September 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>B04</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star    </div>
</p>
<p>Canadians say the high cost of food prevents them from making healthier choices, even though they consider obesity to be a serious health threat, a new study says.</p>
<p>"Cost is a significant barrier to healthier lifestyles for those making less than $75,000 a year," said Jack Bensimon, president of the Toronto advertising agency Bensimon Byrne, which commissioned the study.</p>
<p>Prepared by Gandalf Group, the quarterly Consumerology report tracks consumer opinions on a variety of issues, including the economy, personal financial expectations, buying intentions and key national issues.</p>
<p>Concerns about the health impacts of what we eat each day are greater than concerns about swine flu, poor health care from providers, coal electricity production and nuclear energy generation, the study found.</p>
<p>"Consumerology this quarter reveals that food and nutrition is a significant concern in this country," Bensimon said.</p>
<p>"Canadians are worried about processed food ingredients and obesity, and are actively looking for ways to eat healthier."</p>
<p>Other factors in consumers' failure to choose healthier foods were insufficient willpower, lack of availability, lack of time and inconvenience, the study found.</p>
<p>Consumers believe local, natural, whole and unprocessed foods are the healthiest, the study found, reflecting in part the impact of the local food movement.</p>
<p>"Given the high level of concern about hormones, antibiotics and pesticide use, consumers appear to be feeling that local foods give them similar protection against these things as organic food," Bensimon said.</p>
<p>"Retailers that are moving towards local farming are tapping into a very powerful consumer sentiment."</p>
<p>Canadians eat healthier meals on weekdays than on weekends, with family as opposed to with friends or alone, when least stressed, and at home rather than at work or at restaurants.</p>
<p>Forty-five per cent of parents believe that the meals they eat at fast-food restaurants are not in any way healthy to eat.</p>
<p>Research for the Consumerology report was conducted the week of July 23, when 1,627 Canadians were surveyed. A study of this size is considered to be accurate plus or minus 2.43 per cent 19 times out of 20.</p>

<p>These are scary days for vulnerable First Nations communities across Canada, as the flu season closes in. They have fairly begged Ottawa to beef up health personnel and equipment, and to speed up deliveries of H1N1 vaccines, Tamiflu, sanitizers, face masks, gloves, thermometers, acetaminophen and other supplies.</p>
<p>So what did they get by way of comfort from the federal government? Body bags. Health Canada's Manitoba office couldn't have chosen a more inappropriate moment to ship some 200 bags to remote communities that were hard hit by flu in the spring.</p>

</div><div>By Jeff Outhit   </div>

</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Public health officials are telling residents not to panic over H1N1 flu. No one is in hospital, the disease is mild, and no schools will be closed, heading into flu season.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, pandemic planners ordered 500 body bags last month. They were delivered this month and are now stockpiled at ambulance headquarters on Maple Grove Road, in Cambridge.</p>
<p>That's enough bags for four weeks of regular and pandemic deaths, if the disease starts claiming lives.</p>
<p>Officials say the decision to stockpile body bags does not reflect increased concern about H1N1 flu, now a global pandemic.</p>
<p>"What we are expecting is a busier than usual flu season, but not one that will overwhelm the health-care system," said Dr. Liana Nolan, medical officer of health for the region.</p>
<p>Ambulance chief John Prno said the plan to stockpile body bags for a possible pandemic emergency predates this year's H1N1 outbreak. The order for bags was delayed more than a year, partly to secure higher-priority medical supplies such as gowns, masks and gloves.</p>
<p>"It's got nothing to do with H1N1, or that we're expecting this awful season this year," Prno said. "The timing is just terrible."</p>
<p>The body bags cost almost $26 each. Regional government paid $15,000 for them, including taxes.</p>
<p>The Toronto firm that made the "pandemic body bags" says the local order is not unusual. Communities across Canada are stocking up, while telling residents to wash their hands, cough into their sleeves, and stay home if sick.</p>
<p>"I give them kudos for being on top of it," said Pierre Barcik, president of Trevor Owen Ltd. "They got them delivered in time, so that if there is any pandemic, they're ready. Lots of places aren't."</p>
<p>Barcik can see why the public might be startled, to hear that health planners are stockpiling body bags while insisting the pandemic is mild. "There's a disconnect," he said.</p>
<p>But if things go bad there would be a mass rush on body bags and it would be difficult to fill orders, he said.</p>
<p>The body bags are advertised to "withstand harsh conditions while still containing all body fluids." They are twice as thick as regular bags, last 10 years on a shelf, and are safe to cremate or bury.</p>
<p>Prno said the province has told local planners to stock enough body bags to handle four weeks of pandemic deaths.</p>
<p>He sees no parallel to the controversy in Manitoba, where a flu-stricken First Nation reserve was sent body bags it did not request, in a medical shipment from Health Canada.</p>
<p>The ambulance service always stocks 100 regular body bags, he said.</p>
<p>"It's an awful thing to say, but if WestJet decided to hit the runway one day, we're going to need those body bags," Prno said.</p>
<p>"You can bet that if we were in a situation where we had a lot of deaths, and we had nothing to put the remains in, that we'd be criticized for that as well."</p>

</div><div>By Laura Rance   </div>

</p>
<p>Granted, it doesn't take much to push North American hog markets lower these days, but as reasons go, it doesn't get much more convoluted than a rubber-chicken trade spat.</p>
<p>Hog markets took a temporary nosedive last week after the U.S. government yielded to union pressures to impose import duties on Chinese tires.</p>
<p>Like a row of cascading dominos, the Chinese announced they were investigating whether the U.S. was dumping chicken feet and other chicken products, which prompted fears of a glut of chicken in the United States that would cut retail prices, drawing consumers -- wary because of the H1N1 link to swine -- away from pork purchases.</p>
<p>What do chicken feet and wings, which constitute about half of U.S. poultry product exports to China, have to do with tires? Nothing, except they represent about the same value as the tires China exports to the U.S. -- the only connection necessary in a tit-for-tat retaliatory trade skirmish.</p>
<p>The drop in pork prices placed downward pressure on beef prices. Chicken, pork and beef compete for the same consumer dollar, so anything that affects the price of one has an effect on the others. And whatever happens in the U.S. to depress pork and beef prices spills over onto Canadian producers. Canadian chicken is relatively exempt from the vagaries of foreign trade because the industry is domestically oriented.</p>
<p>Commodity prices bounce up and down all the time, usually related to factors aligned with supply and demand. But it doesn't matter which commodity you are following, it seems that every so often, a wacky equivalent of the rubber-chicken effect creeps into the equation to throw everything out of kilter.</p>
<p>Predicting what the markets will do next has historically been about as easy as forecasting the weather.</p>
<p>But Alex McCalla, the U.S. economist who delivered the Daryl Kraft Memorial Lecture last winter at the University of Manitoba, said the "what next?" question is even harder for market analysts to answer. "Globalization with closer and faster linkages between real and financial markets worldwide means agricultural commodity markets exist in a complex maze of inter-related and often conflicting forces," he said.</p>
<p>He was exploring the rapid -- and unforeseen -- run-up in grain and oilseed prices over the past three years, which at their peak caused food riots in 60 or so poor countries. The short-term political instability and rising concern over the world's ability to feed itself were putting more pressure on pundits to predict market trends -- at the very time as it was becoming less possible to do.</p>
<p>No one predicted the rapid swing of capital into commodity markets as fund investors fled the sub-prime mortgage fiasco or the effect the rising consumption of corn for ethanol-based biofuels would have on global markets. A relatively small -- in global production terms -- adjustment in the supply-demand balance coupled with freakishly large injection of volatility, caused by non-traditional market investors that move en masse, was enough to throw the marketplace into a tailspin.</p>
<p>McCalla said agricultural commodities can be grouped into three general categories -- livestock and livestock products, annual field crops such as grains and oilseeds and perennial crops such as palm oil, coffee and fruits.</p>
<p>But within those categories, the markets differ by what share of the global production actually enters world trade, and whether the major producers are also the major traders. They are also influenced by the degree of concentration among major exporters and importers and the types of trade and production policies those players operate within.</p>
<p>All of these markets behave differently, yet are all linked, either because one commodity can be substituted for another or as in the case of livestock, various feed grains are needed as production rises and falls. And when it comes to investors, agricultural commodities are part of the resource package that includes precious metals and petroleum, so a spike in oil prices can cause the other markets to run amok as well.</p>
<p>It makes the business of predicting farm prices somewhat akin to reading tarot cards. It's all frustrating for farmers who face very tangible costs, real grime and long hours producing crops and livestock without knowing their worth until the day they make a sale.</p>

</p>
<p>Mr. Layton, what is your caption for the photo?</p>
<p>What it immediately reminded me of was a scene in a homeless shelter in Toronto in a church basement.</p>
<p>I walked in and there were people lying cheek by jowl. Even closer than they are in that picture. The lights had been turned down. There was the occasional cough. The occasional person getting up to go the washroom, shuffling past others they didn't know. They didn't have access to showers. And so there were a whole lot of other dimensions other than visual. There was the sound. There was the odour. There was that sense of what a horrible experience that must be.</p>
<p>I don't know where this particular photo is from, but this is what it brought to my mind. … It could be a disaster-relief situation.</p>
<p>You have a powerful emotional response, I can see, but do you have a caption? Here we are on the verge of heading into a possible election, so I guess you will need to start practising snappy sound bites that can encapsulate complicated emotions.</p>
<p>Okay, I guess a caption would be: “Housing For All.”</p>
<p>Homelessness is an issue you have dealt with for a long time</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I've written a rather lengthy book about it. The original title of it was Homeless: The Making and the Unmaking of a Crisis. But I had to go back and rewrite it eight years later because the crisis was worse. The book was twice as long. One hates to think what will happen now to the tens of thousands of people who are homeless across the country when H1N1 flu hits.</p>
<p>When I look at our situation right now, I say, “Why don't we have a national housing program?” Fire up the sawmills that are shutting down and start building affordable housing all over the country – creating work in rural Canada for the sawmills and work in urban Canada for the builders and housing for people who otherwise are having to live in miserable circumstance.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what the picture actually depicts: Parents of college freshmen sleeping in a gymnasium at Huazhong Normal University in central China's Hubei province. Many Chinese parents take time off from work to help their children during their enrolment process. This is back-to-school days in China. How does that change how you see this photo?</p>
<p>On my BlackBerry, I could not see the ethnicity of the people. But what you say is quite fascinating. Of course, Canadian parents whose kids are off to university for the first time are also very dedicated. But this is an indication that, for these parents, this is absolutely critical for their children's future.</p>
<p>When I talk to [my wife] Olivia's mom and dad about why they came to Canada from China, it is a similar story. They left a comfortable, middle-class life. He was a school superintendent and she was a schoolteacher. They had a staff person in their little apartment who looked after Olivia and so on.</p>
<p>They came to Canada. Mrs. Chow ended up cleaning rooms and ultimately working at the laundry in the Delta Chelsea for 35 years. And the father really struggled – never really found employment he could handle on any long-term basis. And you ask them, “Why did you come to Canada?” And they said, “It was the education and the health care!”</p>
<p>They wanted their daughter to have a good education and by golly she did. She ended up a member of Parliament, for heaven's sake. So their dream was realized.</p>
<p>To them, it meant crossing the ocean to a strange land and sacrificing their standard of the living. For these parents in the photo, it means sleeping in a very uncomfortable circumstance, but they are comfortable in the knowledge that they are supporting their young people as they make this important step in their life. It reflects the values I have seen in Olivia's family.</p>
<p>In the fight to keep Canada relevant in the world, how do Canadians compete with a country like China, which has the population, the resources and, clearly, the will to put forward the best-educated people in the world?</p>
<p>They are graduating, for example, huge numbers of engineers every year. The orders of magnitude are so huge. Engineers are problem-solvers. If the Chinese government says, “Let's get off fossil fuel within a decade,” they will have the engineers to figure out how to do it.</p>
<p>We won't compete on size. What we have going for us is an astounding quality of life, the envy of the world. So people want to come here to live, do their research and thinking here, because our communities are amazing. We have to keep them that way.</p>
<p>Which perhaps ties into the homeless question. Because sleeping all over the streets doesn't say much about the quality of life one offers in a community. If you don't make education more affordable, you've given up on your potential in terms of creativity and talent and brain power. It can't be just temporary transfers that depend on the ideological persuasion of govern-</p>
<p>ment A or government B. It has to be locked into law saying these are national objectives.</p>
<p>Given the urgency of the issues you have outlined, why is there such a low level of voter turnout for elections? So much apathy</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>First, because most of the imagery about politics and politicians is negative. Good news is no news when it comes to politics. Do politicians feed into that? To some degree, yes. But 98 per cent of the words spoken at committee meetings, when cameras are not rolling, are not filled with snappy, vindictive, eye-gouging stuff – politicians are actually talking about their ridings and the issues. Still, would it be possible for Parliament to elevate the level of discussion? I think we have a responsibility to do that.</p>
<p>The second issue is that the lack of participation reflects a true alienation, a sense of powerlessness. We've watched these governments change and nothing seems to change in our lives. And these are people with very little power. They can't hire lobbyists to be on the Hill. And dine with politicians at endless receptions. They feel left out. It is difficult to get motivated for them to vote.</p>
<p>You talk about wanting to work together in a minority Parliament to get things done, but your party has voted against this government 79 times.</p>
<p>Only when they were wrong! (Laughs)</p>
<p>But that sends a message – 79 times. The public sees that you are people who do not want to work together</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I embrace the notion of shared responsibility, and this upcoming few weeks – whatever the timelines turn out to be – will be an interesting case in point to see if we can make an effort to make Parliament work and produce some results. I hope that that can happen.</p>
<p>How does the public deal with the possibility of four elections in five years without becoming cynical?</p>
<p>I spend as much time as I can outside the rarefied air of the lobbyists and the spinners and the cameras and drop into the coffee shops across the country to get our reality check. And I try to deliver on what we are hearing. Right now, what I am hearing loud and clear is that people would rather that we found a way of getting something done for them rather than be concerned about the size of your caucus and whether the other one is bigger than yours, you know?</p>
<p>As it were. I guess it's a question of trust. Do Canadians really believe that politicians are working for them, sleeping on mats metaphorically, or just doing things for their own benefit?</p>
<p>That's an interesting metaphor. We are saying to the Prime Minister, if you want to show yourself to be a leader, you have to work with other parties, because it is a minority Parliament. And that's what leadership is all about. Calling people names is not what leadership is all about.</p>
<p>You say he has to work to with other parties. He says you voted against him 79 times. What does that tell us?</p>
<p>All we are saying is, we have laid out a whole series of measures we think are important to implement right now. … We have opened the door and are perhaps the least likely ones to have done so, given how very differently we feel about the issues. Am I sleeping on a mat? No. Am I trying to do what most Canadians want us to be doing? I'm doing my best.</p>
<p>In the event of an election, will your candidates and teams have to sleep on mats or does the NDP have enough money to fight an election?</p>
<p>We will be fine financially. We are pretty good at keeping our financial house in order. We've managed our affairs carefully so that we are in good shape.</p>
<p>Amid all the political drama right now, when you may hold the balance of power, what do you say to yourself when you get home at night?</p>
<p>Well, the winds can blow and people can call you names, but I have been at this a long while and I'm used to that. And my wife and I always say to each other, “Are we doing the right thing? How does it feel?” Maybe I am lucky because my wife is also a member of Parliament. So all I will say is, we sleep well at night.</p>

<p>Jack Layton</p>
<p>Three words sum up the recent career of NDP Leader Jack Layton: balance of power.</p>
<p>As the 59-year-old MP from Toronto-Danforth tries to find a way to work with his archrivals in the Conservative Party on issues such as employment insurance, he has to do it without appearing to sell out his working-class constituents – a concern he shares with his wife, Olivia Chow, another downtown-Toronto New Democratic MP.</p>
<p>Propping up a minority government is becoming something of a Layton signature. He did it in May, 2005, with Paul Martin's Liberals and claims he won major policy concessions as a result. With the country on the brink of the fourth federal election in five years, finding out what really motivates Mr. Layton has become the most important political game of the season.Evan Solomon</p>

</div><div>Richard Watts, With files from Matthew Pearson </div>
<div>Times Colonist; With files from Canwest News Service</div>
<div>674 words</div><div>18 September 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist </div>
</p>
<p>A woman from the Beecher Bay reserve west of Metchosin has died from H1N1 flu, the first fatality on Vancouver Island and the sixth in B.C.</p>
<p>The woman died Wednesday afternoon in Victoria General Hospital after being admitted on Saturday, Dr. Richard Stanwick, chief medical health officer of the Vancouver Island Health Authority, said yesterday.</p>
<p>Two children are also in hospital with H1N1: One from Beecher Bay is in good condition, and the other from a non-native North Island community is in critical condition.</p>
<p>Stanwick said the woman who died suffered "pre-existing medical conditions," although he</p>
<p>wouldn't specify what those were. But he said, in general, H1N1 has been more severe when combined with anything that compromises breathing, which could range from asthma to lung disease and pregnancy.</p>
<p>Beecher Bay Chief Russell Chipps said news of the woman's death has devastated his community. "She was a really good woman. We're lost without her."</p>
<p>Chipps would not disclose her name or age, but said she managed the band office for more than six years. In the wake of the woman's death, Chipps said the band is taking infection-control measures, including cleaning her home and office, stocking up on hand sanitizers and consulting with health officials about other measures.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu, first detected in Mexico in the spring, arrived in B.C. in April. Since then, about 50 severe cases have been diagnosed in B.C. Infections tapered off over summer, but health officials expect the disease to take off again as children return to schools. Symptoms are similar to those for regular seasonal flu: fever, aches, fatigue and coughing.</p>
<p>VIHA's announcement about the woman's death came hours after a controversial article was published online by the Canadian Medical Association Journal reporting a major outbreak of H1N1 on the Ahousaht reserve, near Tofino. The article said the Island was Canada's "first pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak."</p>
<p>Charmaine Enns, medical director for aboriginal health for VIHA, slammed the article, calling it "not only irresponsible but inflammatory."</p>
<p>Enns said health officials have known for weeks about H1N1 cases in remote First Nations communities. She estimated that out of a population of 800 to 1,000 residents, 100 Ahousaht residents might have been affected by H1N1. Only six of those cases were lab-confirmed -- they were reported in early- to mid-August -- and no related deaths have been reported there.</p>
<p>Enns accused the medical journal of exaggerating the situation. "That increase [in] the level of alarm and anxiety -- that is completely unfounded." She said of the 51 First Nations communities on Vancouver Island, four have had confirmed cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>Wayne Kondro, the Canadian Medical Association Journal editor who wrote the article, disputed Enns's accusation. "It's in all of our communities on Vancouver Island, not just one. So is she saying we're wrong because we didn't say it is as severe as it is?"</p>
<p>He also said the publication's use of the term "pandemic" isn't an indication of the severity of the outbreak -- the journal refers to the disease as "pandemic H1N1 2009," the name the World Health Organization gave the flu.</p>
<p>Kondro's article was based on information from a family physician,</p>
<p>Dr. John Armstrong of Tofino, who said he treated "dozens" of people infected with the virus.</p>
<p>Curtis Dick, deputy chief of Ahousaht and its emergency co-ordinator, said the attention on his community was a surprise. Dick said his band, along with other First Nations, have been planning for months to deal with a pandemic and is in regular contact with health professionals. He said the community and its school have worked hard to raise awareness of the flu and keep infection rates down.</p>
<p>"We have a pandemic plan here," said Dick.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Gov't apologizes for body bag shipment; Number of bags delivered with flu supplies was 'excessive': official</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick </div>
<div>Canwest News Service; with Winnipeg Free Press Files</div>
<div>808 words</div><div>18 September 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>D7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>
</p>
<p>The federal government admitted Thursday that it was insensitive to send body bags in a shipment of medical supplies to First Nations communities awaiting help to prepare for the fall flu season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, officials said the shipment in no way reflected how severely they expected the H1N1 virus to hit Native communities this fall.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, who on Wednesday ordered an investigation into the controversy, followed up Thursday with a statement saying as an aboriginal person she was offended and that what happened was "unacceptable."</p>
<p>"To all who took offence at what occurred, I want to say that I share your concern and I pledge to get to the bottom of it," said Aglukkaq, who was attending a meeting in Winnipeg with her provincial and territorial counterparts.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq's statement stopped short of the personal apology that Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff called on the minister to make. But, later in the day, her department issued a full-fledged mea culpa and sought to explain why the body bags were sent to communities including the Wasagamack First Nation.</p>
<p>"Health Canada apologizes for the error that was made in the number of body bags that were ordered for the Wasagamack First Nations. We regret the alarm that this incident has caused," said the statement.</p>
<p>Health Canada did not specify what that number was but according to media reports, the reserve, located about 600 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg, received at least 30.</p>
<p>Body bags are among the medical supplies Health Canada routinely delivers to the nursing stations on First Nations reserves the statement said, and they are not necessarily related to pandemic preparations being made for aboriginal communities.</p>
<p>The body bag controversy emerged Wednesday when the leaders of several Manitoba First Nations communities, who have been asking the federal government for help to prepare for the fall flu season, reported their shock at receiving post-mortem kits, along with hand sanitizer wipes and masks. The incident set off immediate controversy as the chiefs expressed their outrage and disappointment with the federal government.</p>
<p>"It is unfortunate that this has been linked exclusively with H1N1," Health Canada said in its statement. "Whether it's a nursing station in a remote First Nations community in northern Manitoba, or a hospital in downtown Vancouver, supplies are constantly being re-stocked to prepare for unknown and unforeseen events, whether it be a plane crash, environmental disaster or pandemic," it also said.</p>
<p>Jim Wolfe, regional director of Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit Health division for Manitoba, told reporters in Winnipeg the department "overestimated" the reserve's requirements and a review is now being done to ensure other communities are getting appropriate supplies.</p>
<p>He said there is no right or wrong number of body bags to order and that health officials try their best to estimate what is needed based on what's happened previously in the community and what can be expected in the future.</p>
<p>"Clearly in this case, I think, the numbers that we have for Wasagamack were . . . excessive to what we may be needing. We don't know that for sure because there are many unknowns."</p>
<p>Given the uncertainty about how severe the H1N1 pandemic could be in the coming months, and the challenges of delivering supplies to isolated communities, a re-stock of supplies was done for a three-to-four month period, Health Canada said. The number of body bags sent to Wasagamack "clearly does not correlate with the current evidence" that the Public Health Agency of Canada has on how severe the H1N1 flu is expected to be in the fall.</p>
<p>- NO OUTBREAK: OFFICIAL</p>
<p>A B.C. health official on Thursday slammed an "inflammatory" article published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal that reported a major outbreak of H1N1 flu near Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>"I need to express my disappointment in that publication," said Dr. Charmaine Enns, a medical health officer with the Vancouver Island Health Authority. "I actually found that reporting not only irresponsible, but inflammatory."</p>
<p>The Journal had reported that a major outbreak of H1N1 flu had occurred in the rural First Nations community of Ahousat, just off western Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>Enns said the article did not report anything new, because health officials had known for weeks about H1N1 cases in remote First Nations communities.</p>
<p>Instead, the CMAJ has exaggerated the situation, Enns said.</p>
<p>She estimated that, out of a population of 800 to 1,000 residents, Ahousat may have seen 100 people affected by H1N1 since it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization last spring. Only six of those cases were lab-confirmed, and no related deaths have been reported there.</p>

<p>With rising sales of surgical masks and hand sanitizers, fears of a swine flu outbreak have kicked off a small boom in Canada's medical supply industry as distributors scramble to fill orders for products to prevent transmission of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Most ominously, demand for "human remains pouches" is up as governments prepare for worst-case scenarios, says a Scarborough, Ont., company that manufactures the body bags.</p>
<p>"Some of the better-organized municipalities and provinces, and states in the U.S., are getting on the program now and buying inventory for storage," said Pierre Barcik, president of Trevor Owen Ltd. "Hopefully, they never have to use it."</p>
<p>Barcik's company manufactures specialized pandemic body bags that are designed to withstand temperatures to -40C, "while still containing all body fluids . . . to prevent leakage or seepage."</p>
<p>The Alberta government has bought from him, and he recently filled an order for the City of Waterloo for 500 units, Barcik said.</p>
<p>Body bags were cast into the spotlight this week when Health Canada shipped more than 200 post-mortem kits to First Nations communities in Northern Manitoba, prompting howls of outrage and an apology from the department.</p>
<p>A Health Canada official said Thursday that the bags were sent as part of a regular restocking, not specifically in anticipation of swine flu deaths, but allowed that too many were shipped.</p>
<p>Sales of flu-related medical products have also jumped. As the World Health Organization increased its H1N1 pandemic level, so, too, did demand for hand sanitizers, hard-surface disinfectants, gloves and isolation gowns, said Jeff Stevens, president of The Stevens Company, Canada's second-largest distributor of medical products.</p>
<p>Hospitals began buying up more supplies when the WHO elevated H1N1 to a level 5 pandemic in April. But when the highest level was reached in June, the company's stockpiles of N95 masks and hand sanitizer were cleaned out.</p>

</p>
<p>With their provinces facing a budget-busting price tag to fight an anticipated swine flu pandemic, Canada's health ministers are asking Ottawa to do more to defray the cost of a national H1N1 vaccination program.</p>
<p>The ministers, gathered here for the Provincial-Territorial Conference of Ministers of Health, are sharing their plans and preparations for the expected fall outbreak.</p>
<p>Ottawa has already agreed to cover 60 per cent of the cost of the vaccine itself, which runs about $8 a dose. But the provinces are facing costs of another $8 a dose for such related costs as transportation, refrigeration and administration.</p>
<p>And, if the pandemic explodes, the provinces could each be grappling with millions of dollars of extra costs for boosting intensive care beds, staff overtime, new ventilators and dozens of other unexpected needs.</p>
<p>"There was an openness on the part of the federal government to discussing how it could help provinces in extreme cases," said Manitoba Health Minister Theresa Oswald, conference chairwoman.</p>
<p>The provinces want Ottawa to treat H1N1 more like a flash flood or earthquake; the federal government covers 90 per cent of the cost of dealing with natural disasters.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Ottawa released its priority list for flu shots, which included residents of remote communities, health-care workers, pregnant women and those suffering chronic illnesses.</p>
<p>First Nations have been hit especially hard by the virus, which thrives in communities with overcrowded housing and limited access to fresh water.</p>
<p>Several northern Manitoba communities have struggled with higher-than-normal infection rates. Those communities were outraged recently to receive a shipment of body bags in a federal consignment of material to fight the flu.</p>
<p>The health ministers also pressed Ottawa for "definitive action" on securing a stable supply of medical isotopes. The ministers are calling on the federal government to provide compensation for extra costs incurred due to the shutdown of the federally owned Chalk River nuclear reactor, which has been shut down since May 2009.</p>

<p>CHART OF THE DAY / TOURISM</p>
<p>Japanese warm to Canada</p>
<p>As a travel destination, Canada is on the rebound, and you can thank the Japanese to some degree.</p>
<p>Travel into Canada was up 4.1 per cent in July from a dismal June, and although numbers are still down compared with last summer, things are getting better, according to data released yesterday by Statistics Canada.</p>
<p>The most significant change came in trips by Japanese visitors. Those were down sharply in May, by 33.5 per cent, but rose by 32.4 per cent in July.</p>
<p>“We've seen it before, that whenever something major happens, health-wise, Japan tends to react quite strongly,” said Statscan analyst Eric Desjardins. “It was similar with SARS in 2003, and now this time with swine flu.”</p>
<p>Fears in Japan about the H1N1 virus hit a new high in May, when the country's first two cases were confirmed. Those came from abroad, in the form of two students who had visited New York.</p>
<p>But easing fears, combined with a visit by Japan's Emperor and Empress to Canada in July, may have helped to bolster visits, Mr. Desjardins said.</p>

<p>SELLING MORE SHARES THAN THEY BUY</p>
<p>So much for all that excess cash.</p>
<p>After a seven-year binge of share buybacks, U.S. companies outside the farm and financial sector finally sold in the second quarter of 2009 more shares than they bought, according to BMO Nesbitt Burns research.</p>
<p>The financial crisis, and the recession hit to the bottom line, led companies to restock their balance sheets with equity and led to net issuance for the first time since 2002. Still, at an $88-billion annual rate clocked in the second quarter, it will take a long time to flood the market with the stock that disappeared during the buyback bonanza, which peaked at a $1-trillion rate in 2007.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>China anticipates tough winter of H1N1; Flu vaccine available to only 5% of population</b>
</div><div>Aileen Mccabe </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>591 words</div><div>18 September 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Early</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal </div>
</p>
<p>China looked set for a tough winter as confirmed cases of H1N1 flu reached 10,000 across the country this week and totals appeared to be multiplying fast.</p>
<p>"In the last week or so, the increase has been quite quick," Vivian Tan, communications director for the World Health Organization in Beijing, said in an interview.</p>
<p>Tan put the increased numbers down to students returning to school across the country and perhaps a slight dip in temperatures after the summer heat, but she noted that the beginning of "flu season," which usually runs from November until March, is still a ways off.</p>
<p>According to Xinhua, China's official news agency, the Ministry of Health confirmed 1,118 new cases of swine flu in just one 48-hour period during the middle of this week.</p>
<p>It said that all but eight of the new cases were contracted in China as opposed to being carried into the country by people coming from abroad, which was the major source of infection in China throughout the past summer.</p>
<p>Now that H1N1 has become an almost exclusively homegrown epidemic, China has stopped its controversial policy of quarantining anyone entering the country with an elevated temperature or, often, anyone who arrived from a country reporting high rates of H1N1, such as Mexico, Canada and the U. S., whether they had flu symptoms.</p>
<p>China was the first country in the world to develop an H1N1 vaccine, and although it was rushed into production earlier this month it is expected to produce enough serum to vaccinate only about five per cent of the country's 1.3 billion citizens. "Quite frankly the production capacity is not enough," Tan said.</p>
<p>China has prioritized "high-risk" groups to receive the free vaccine and Tan said that many of the groups the WHO is most worried about are on China's A-list, including pregnant women, health workers and people with chronic health conditions such as asthma.</p>
<p>But each country sets its own "risk" priorities and Beijing has also decided to quickly vaccinate anyone participating in the grand military parade and gala pageant that are planned for Oct. 1 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p>Health Minister Chen Zhu did not say exactly how much of the precious vaccine would be reserved for them, but approximately 200,000 people are involved in the celebrations.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Daily reports that people doing preparation work for the 2010 Shanghai World Expo are also on the H1N1 priority list and will receive free jabs of both seasonal flu and H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>The paper said it has yet to be decided what share of the city's allotment of H1N1 vaccine would go to Expo workers, but "health officials said they will set aside 3.6 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine for Expo-related inoculations."</p>
<p>The Chinese H1N1 vaccine will not be available to expatriates living in China.</p>
<p>Throughout the summer, H1N1 appeared to be confined to China's big cities, but health officials now say it is moving into rural areas, and all 31 provinces and regions have reported cases. China has so far recorded no H1N1 fatalities.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Body bags shipment 'insensitive'; Ottawa apologizes for incident; 'We regret the alarm' caused: Health Canada</b>
</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK    </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>343 words</div><div>18 September 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>The federal government admitted yesterday it was insensitive to send body bags in a shipment of medical supplies to First Nations communities awaiting help to prepare for the fall flu season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, officials said the shipment in no way reflected how severely they expected the swine flu virus to hit native communities this fall.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, who on Wednesday ordered an investigation into the controversy, followed up yesterday with a statement saying as an aboriginal person she was offended and that what happened was "unacceptable."</p>
<p>"To all who took offence at what occurred, I want to say that I share your concern and I pledge to get to the bottom of it," she said in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>In her absence from the House of Commons, other Conservative MPs faced a storm of criticism.</p>
<p>"What happened was inexcusable. It was unfortunate; it was regrettable; it was incredibly insensitive," said Transport Minister John Baird.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq's statement stopped short of the personal apology that Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff called on the minister to make. But</p>
<p>later in the day, her department issued a full-fledged mea culpa and sought to explain why the body bags were sent to communities, including the Wasagamack First Nation.</p>
<p>"Health Canada apologizes for the error that was made in the number of body bags that were ordered for the Wasagamack First Nations. We regret the alarm that this incident has caused," the statement said.</p>
<p>The controversy emerged Wednesday when the leaders of several Manitoba First Nations communities, who have been asking the federal government for help to prepare for the fall flu season, reported their shock at receiving post-mortem kits, along with hand sanitizer wipes and masks. The incident set off immediate controversy as the chiefs expressed their outrage and disappointment with the federal government.</p>
<p>It comes after months of tense relations between some aboriginal leaders and the federal government over assistance for pandemic planning.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu shots start in November; H1N1 vaccine still being tested; Inoculations could begin earlier if supplies available: public health chief</b>
</div><div>KEVIN DOUGHERTY   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>554 words</div><div>18 September 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>About 100 clinics across the province will vaccinate 200,000 people a day, seven days a week, in November against the A(H1N1) flu virus.</p>
<p>Dr. Alain Poirier, Quebec's public health director, said yesterday 11.5 million doses of the vaccine will be available for the province's 7.5 million residents.</p>
<p>Vaccination is not mandatory, but Poirier urged all Quebecers to be inoculated.</p>
<p>While the Quebec death toll from what's known as swine flu is 27 and is lower than expected, vaccination is the best protection, he noted.</p>
<p>"I'm sure those people would have liked to have had the vaccine," Poirier said, noting two pregnant women are among the dead, and there are Quebecers with H1N1 in intensive care. "I think we have to do what we are doing."</p>
<p>The vaccine is being tested and is expected to be ready by Nov. 15, he said, but the inoculations would start earlier if the vaccine is ready sooner.</p>
<p>Poirier said the vaccine in tests is proving more effective than hoped and one dose appears to be sufficient - not two, as the World Health Organization originally advised.</p>
<p>Quebec will follow the pattern for the rest of Canada, vaccinating according to risk.</p>
<p>Pregnant women are the first priority, followed by children age 6 months to 5 years, Poirier said. The vaccination does not work on children younger than 6 months.</p>
<p>People in isolated areas, like northern Quebec, are also a priority group. Health care workers, people age 5 to 18, police and firefighters, and people age 18 to 65 would follow.</p>
<p>Contrary to regular seasonal influenza, people age 65 or more appear to be less at risk from the H1N1 virus. Poirier also noted that people born before the 1957 A(H2N2) Asian flu pandemic appear to have some immunity to H1N1.</p>
<p>People with a severe allergy to eggs cannot be vaccinated, because the vaccine culture is grown in eggs.</p>
<p>Quebec is in a trough between the first wave of the disease and the expected second wave, Poirier said, with only 20 cases reported this month, including four new cases this week. But a second wave of H1N1 in fall and winter, the usual flu season, seems a certainty, he said.</p>
<p>While the virus is milder than expected and hasn't mutated to become more lethal, that remains a possibility, he said. But if the H1N1 virus does mutate before people can be vaccinated, the vaccine would still offer them protection, Poirier said.</p>
<p>The massive campaign to vaccinate all Quebecers against H1N1, and the planned regular vaccination for the seasonal flu virus, could confuse people, he acknowledged.</p>
<p>One possibility being considered, to dispel this confusion, would be to cancel the seasonal flu vaccine, he said.</p>
<p>Medical personnel ought to be vaccinated so they can care for people who get the disease, Poirier said, while police and firefighters are required for public safety.</p>
<p>He said it should be easier to vaccinate people in schools, the public sector and big companies, but there will also be a special effort to alert people in small and medium-size businesses of the risks of H1N1.</p>

<p>Far be it for diehard fitness buffs to let a little fever stop them from doing their regular workout. But it's not actually laudable to laugh in the face of an illness such as the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"The best information we have says complete bed rest is best," says David Nieman, director of the human performance lab at Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C.</p>
<p>And forget the idea you can sweat out the flu through exercise: "That's a myth," he says. "A big myth."</p>
<p>Working out, especially at a vigorous pace for a long stretch, may do more harm than good.</p>
<p>"We know that heavy exertion causes a transient downturn in immune function that can last from a few hours to a day," says Nieman, a professor of health and exercise science.</p>
<p>During heavy, prolonged physical exertion, he adds, stress hormone levels such as cortisol rise, causing immune cells to function less efficiently.</p>
<p>Marian Kohut, professor of immunobiology, kinesiology and gerontology at Iowa State University, says a good way to prevent the spread of diseases is to wipe down equipment before and after use at the gym. Also, don't touch the eyes, nose and mouth while on any equipment, since that's how the virus can be transmitted. And always drink extra fluids during the flu season.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Putting a mask on H1N1 flu</b>
</div><div>Shari Roan  </div>
<div>Los Angeles Times</div>
<div>579 words</div><div>18 September 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>G05</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>The visible symbol of the H1N1 flu outbreak last spring seemed to be face masks. Suddenly, they were everywhere -- in airports and waiting rooms, on buses and trains. Many drugstores sold out of masks.</p>
<p>As we gird ourselves for a fall outbreak of H1N1 flu, masks may make a reappearance.</p>
<p>Here is a brief primer on masks.</p>
<p>Q: Should I wear a mask?</p>
<p>A: In general, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend use of face masks or respirators in nonhealth care settings. But there are exceptions.</p>
<p>Because the strain of H1N1 influenza has led to a pandemic, people who are ill with the virus should consider wearing a mask around other people, if tolerable.</p>
<p>People who are at risk for severe illness from the flu should wear a mask or respirator if they are caring for someone with the flu, and should consider wearing one if there is an outbreak of flu in the community.</p>
<p>People who are not at high risk for flu complications could consider wearing one if there is an outbreak in the community, but it's not recommended.</p>
<p>Q: What kind is most effective?</p>
<p>A: There are two types of protection -- face masks and respirators.</p>
<p>Masks are loose-fitting and designed to stop the spread of droplets from the person wearing the mask, not to protect the wearer from viruses.</p>
<p>Respirators are close-fitting and more expensive. They are designed to reduce exposure to airborne particles.</p>
<p>The CDC recommends N95 respirators for health-care workers. The Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. has approved four models of respirators to help reduce exposure during a flu pandemic: 3M respirators models 8612F and 8670F, and Pasture Pharma respirator models F550G and A520G. It's easiest to find them online.</p>
<p>Q: But do they really work?</p>
<p>A: It's still unclear how influenza is spread, whether through direct contact, the spray of droplets from an infected person to an uninfected person (within a proximity of two metres), or through inhaling smaller, airborne particles.</p>
<p>However, studies show that fit-tested N95 respirators filter out 95 to 99 per cent of influenza particles, and have maximum effectiveness when fitted properly to the face.</p>
<p>A study published in 2008 in the journal PLoS One found that respirators are more efficient than masks in reducing the transmission of respiratory infections.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a correct way to wear a mask?</p>
<p>A: Wash your hands with soap and water before putting on a mask.</p>
<p>Make sure it fits tightly and that no hair, clothing or jewellery comes between the mask and your face.</p>
<p>Inexpensive masks have a limited lifespan -- only about 30 minutes -- because they become moist and may lose shape and allow particles in.</p>
<p>They should be removed if they become wet or damaged. Never reuse a mask.</p>
<p>When a mask is removed, throw it away in a closed waste container, wash your hands and put on a new mask. For tips on fitting a respirator to your face correctly, see:</p>
<p>cdc.gov/h1n1flu/eua/pdf/n95factsheet.pdf.</p>
<p>Q: Can kids wear masks?</p>
<p>A: Masks and respirators are not designed to fit children. Children may have difficulty breathing while wearing a mask, and may not be able to let others know they are having trouble.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Cold-FX lawsuit settled; Flu-treatment maker to pay investors $7.1m</b>
</div><div>Brenda Bouw  </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>727 words</div><div>18 September 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>Afexa Life Sciences Inc., maker of the popular cold and flu treatment Cold-FX, has reached a settlement with investors who accused the company of misleading financial statements after the disappointing launch of its product in the States.</p>
<p>The $7.1-million settlement comes after the Edmonton-based company, formerly known as CV Technologies, reached an agreement last month with the Alberta Securities Commission related to "wrongly recognizing revenue" from its Cold-FX sales to U.S. retailers.</p>
<p>The settlements come as the company rebrands under new management, tries to build up its sunken share price and prepares for its role as an official supplier at the 2010 Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>"We decided to settle the action rather than fight it because the legal costs would have been in the millions, regardless of what the outcome in the court would have been," Cold-FX spokesperson Warren Michaels said. "We are pleased we have an agreement that brings the entire matter to an end."</p>
<p>Afexa said claims made by the investors in the class action remain unproven. The settlement still requires court approval.</p>
<p>The settlement also comes ahead of the flu season, which is a crucial sales period for Afexa and has heightened awareness this year thanks to the menacing swine flu.</p>
<p>Afexa also continues to push sales of its ginseng-based product in Canada by giving it away to school kids and releasing a survey showing the reluctance of Canadians to get the shot for swine flu.</p>
<p>The suits were launched in Ontario and Alberta in August 2007 against the company, some of its officers, former directors and former auditor and relate to an ambitious launch of Cold-FX in the U.S. market in 2006.</p>
<p>The class action alleged the company's financial statements were misleading for the year ended Sept. 30, 2006, and its interim unaudited financial statements for the first quarter of fiscal 2007.</p>
<p>The company reported revenue of about $47 million in 2006. However, it later said those figures were based on volume of product delivered to U.S. retailers to stock their shelves. Expected Cold-FX sales didn't materialize south of the border and some product was returned.</p>
<p>In March 2007, the company announced it would restate its results for 2006 and the first quarter of 2007 as a result.</p>
<p>In July 2007, it restated those earnings, saying its profit for 2006 was $639,000, down from the previously reported $4.1 million. Revenues were revised to $41.4 million.</p>
<p>For the first quarter of 2007, the loss was restated as $3.6 million, which was steeper than the originally reported loss of $1.6 million.</p>
<p>Revenues were reduced to $22.6 million, from $25.2 million.</p>
<p>The proposed class action included investors who bought shares between Dec. 11, 2006, when the company said it would enter the U.S. market, and March 23, 2007, when it said U.S. sales had disappointed and could have a " serious impact" on its cash position.</p>
<p>The stock, which was trading just above $2 at the time the news was released, plummeted and has never recovered.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Afexa shares closed down a penny at 55 cents on the Toronto Stock Exchange, after hitting a 52-week high of 58 cents last week.</p>
<p>The stock was trading at a low of 23 cents in December. It hit an all-time of $4.46 in October 2006.</p>
<p>Afexa said the proposed class action settlement dismisses all claims.</p>
<p>"The settlement does not constitute any admission of liability by Afexa or its officers, directors and employees," Afexa stated in a release late Wednesday.</p>
<p>The company said it will use its insurance to cover the settlement costs.</p>
<p>Lawyer Jay Strosberg, who helped launch the class action, called the settlement "an excellent result."</p>
<p>Strosberg said the case would have likely involved a long battle through the courts.</p>
<p>"This was a risky case," he said, citing in part the company's current financial position.</p>
<p>During the first nine months of fiscal 2009, Afexa revenue fell to $32 million from $35.3 million for the same time last year.</p>

</div><div>The Canadian Press</div>

</p>
<p>WINNIPEG</p>
<p>Body bags that were sent to flu-stricken Manitoba reserves were part of "routine restocking" of supplies, says Health Canada.</p>
<p>Jim Wolfe, regional director with the First Nations and Inuit health branch of the department, said yesterday that the bags were part of a shipment intended for reserves to use over the winter and were not "linked exclusively to H1N1."</p>
<p>"We really regret the alarm this incident has caused and it was unintended," Wolfe said. "We order these supplies as a matter of routine business and ... this was part of a very normal restocking process."</p>
<p>Reserves often have suicides, drownings and other deaths that require the bags, he said. In this case, Wolfe said the department "overestimated" how many bags might be needed during a second wave of swine flu expected this fall.</p>
<p>While many aboriginal leaders interpreted the shipment of body bags as a "grim prediction" of the number of deaths expected among remote communities, Wolfe said that's not the case.</p>
<p>The federal health minister has formally ordered a probe into why the government sent the bags with other flu supplies.</p>
<p>"As minister of health and as an aboriginal, I am offended," Leona Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>"To all who took offence at what occurred, I want to say that I share your concern and I pledge to get to the bottom of it."</p>
<p>Critics and aboriginal leaders had said the body bags sent the message that Ottawa expects aboriginals to die and that the bags are part of the federal government's plan to deal with a second wave of H1N1. Aglukkaq rejected that suggestion.</p>
<p>"I was born and raised in remote communities and I understand the challenges better than anyone -- that's why I have met frequently with First Nations organizations," she said. "Anyone suggesting that our government's solution to H1N1 is body bags is sensationalizing this situation."</p>
<p>Shawn Atleo, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said the decision to send the bags shows a tendency on Ottawa's part to proceed without first talking to aboriginals.</p>

</p>
<p>Providing the most current health solutions to ensure the health of employees and safety in the workplace has become hugely important to corporations, institutions and governments. And it's keeping Calgary-based COHR Health (Canadian Occupational Health Resources) busy in the extensive number of services it provides throughout the province.</p>
<p>President Marilou Inkster says her team of nurses, physicians, and lab, breath alcohol, audiometric and spirometry technicians is available 24/7 for testing that is performed either in the two Calgary centres, in her Edmonton office or on-site.</p>
<p>Drug and alcohol testing is a huge part of the business and she says her staff has to be one step ahead of those coming up with new ways to try to cheat the diagnostic system. It is possible, for instance, to buy a Synthetic Urine Substitute Kit over the counter in Fort McMurray--but her staff members are well aware, as they are of screw-bottom soft drink cans where drugs can be hidden.</p>
<p>COHR Health helps companies to write their drug and alcohol policies, and trains supervisors in how to identify substance abuse in the workplace. It is certified to collect and test, and to conduct round-the-clock emergency post-accident testing, reasonable suspicion testing and phone support.</p>
<p>Besides checking for drug use, COHR Health conducts other fitness-to-work testing that could include pre-employment medicals, job demand analysis, audiometrics that provide custom-moulded earplugs, and sight-testing and fitting of prescription safety glasses.</p>
<p>Flu immunization for large corporations is another of its programs and it is approved by the Calgary Health Region to give H1N1 shots either in-office or on site. The company also owns a large RV that has been outfitted to provide testing labs and it travels extensively to job sites around the province.</p>
<p>Marilou and her husband, Neil, bought the company in 2002 and it has grown six times over since then. But it doesn't take long into a conversation about COHR Health for the topic to be focused on another important part of their lives.</p>
<p>Both trained as opticians, they founded the Calgary Eye Way Society, which, along with Neighbour Link and Community Kitchen Program, forms part of Storehouse-39-3-10, a collaborative co-location project that supports the less fortunate in so many ways.</p>
<p>The Inksters provide prescription glasses to people generally referred to them by organizations, including the Dream Centre, drop-in centre, Red Cross, Homeless Foundation and churches. COHR Health donates the lenses, and frames are donated by suppliers such as Crown Optical.</p>
<p>Last year it began with fitting a total of 85 pairs of glasses; this year, it's given away more than 200 already --all new and very nice. Neil says, "I don't want my clients walking around in a second-hand pair, they must feel proud."</p>
<p>The next part of this dream is to raise enough funds to hire a person to train those living in poverty to become lens grinders. The equipment is ready and waiting.</p>
<p>Parking must be one of the more important employee perks these days, so if you are a company looking at a move to where staff can drive to work without worrying about a place to leave their vehicles all day, you might want to take a look at the building WestJet vacated on 11th Street N. E.</p>
<p>Peter Mayerchak of Colliers International has the listing, and he tells me the four-storey, 64,168-square-foot building has a remarkable parking ratio, providing 430 stalls.</p>
<p>It also comes with naming rights that allow for super exposure to Deerfoot Trail and McKnight Boulevard, has a third-floor patio wrapping around the south and west exposures, and is, of course, just minutes away from the airport.</p>
<p>Fifteen international energy cities will be sending delegations to Calgary Oct. 7 to 9 to attend the annual general meeting of the World Energy Cities Partnership, which is being hosted by Calgary Economic Development and the City of Calgary at the Westin Calgary hotel.</p>
<p>Calgary and four other leading oil and gas cities founded the partnership, which acts as a forum to share experiences and contacts, and to provide support for each other in tackling common industry issues.</p>
<p>Russ Strilchuk, who has more than 20 years of industry sales and management experience, most recently managing the Canadian operations of a multinational natural gas compression company, will join Total Energy Services on Sept. 21 as vice-president of sales and marketing.</p>

<p>A B. C. health official on Thursday slammed an "inflammatory" article published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal that reported a major outbreak of H1N1 flu near Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>"I need to express my disappointment in that publication," said Dr. Charmaine Enns, a medical health officer with the Vancouver Island Health Authority.</p>
<p>"I actually found that reporting not only irresponsible, but inflammatory. There was no securing the facts before that was printed, so I find that really unfortunate."</p>
<p>The journal had reported that a major outbreak of H1N1 flu had occurred in the rural First Nations community of Ahousat, just off western Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>Enns said the article did not report anything new, because health officials had known for weeks about H1N1 cases in remote First Nations communities.</p>
<p>"We have been very transparent," she said. "There is no story there."</p>
<p>Instead, the CMAJ has exaggerated the situation, Enns said.</p>

<p>Daybook, a daily compendium of news, trends, data and analysis compiled by Report on Business editors and reporters, for Friday, Sept. 18:</p>
<p>U.S. companies end buyback binge</p>
<p>So much for all that excess cash.</p>
<p>After a seven-year binge of share buybacks, U.S. companies outside the farm and financial sector finally sold more shares than they bought in the first quarter, according to BMO Nesbitt Burns research.</p>
<p>The financial crisis and the recession's hit to the bottom line led companies to restock their balance sheets with equity and led to net issuance for the first time since 2002. Still, at an $88-billion (U.S.) annual rate clocked in the second-quarter, it will take a long time to flood the market with all the stock that disappeared during the buyback bonanza, which peaked at a $1-trillion rate in 2007. Boyd Erman</p>
<p>As a travel destination, Canada is on the rebound, and you can thank the Japanese to some degree.</p>
<p>Travel into Canada was up 4.1 per cent in July from a dismal June, and although numbers are still down compared with last summer, things are getting better, according to data released Thursday by Statistics Canada.</p>
<p>The most significant change came in trips by Japanese visitors. Those were down sharply in May, by 33.5 per cent, but rose by 32.4 per cent in July.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen it before, that whenever something major happens, health-wise, Japan tends to react quite strongly,” said Statscan analyst Eric Desjardins. “It was similar with SARS in 2003, and now this time with swine flu.”</p>
<p>Fears in Japan about the H1N1 virus hit a new high in May, when the country’s first two cases were confirmed. Those came from abroad, in the form of two students who had visited New York.</p>
<p>But easing fears, combined with a visit by Japan’s Emperor and Empress to Canada in July, may have helped to bolster visits, Mr. Desjardins said. Susan Krashinsky</p>
<p>Weekend reading</p>
<p>So you’re settling into your weekend, armed with Muskoka chair and sunscreen, determined to make the most out of the death rattles of summer, and you need a good read. Here are a few business titles to help pass the time:</p>
<p>The 4-Hour Workweek, Tim Ferriss</p>
<p>Okay, so you might not come away looking like the handsome Princeton guest lecturer/tango dancer/kick boxer/author with the chiselled jaw, but his book promises to do pretty much everything else: Cut your workload, make you super-successful and help you live like the “New Rich.”</p>
<p>The Myth of the Rational Market, Justin Fox</p>
<p>In efficient market we trust? The story of an academic idea gone wrong.</p>
<p>Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell</p>
<p>The intellect with the trademark curls looks into what makes extraordinary people successful.</p>
<p>The Accidental Billionaires, Ben Mezrich</p>
<p>If reading about rich people who aren’t you isn’t depressing enough, try reading about a really rich person, who isn’t you: The wunderkind behind social networking phenomenon Facebook. Susan Krashinsky</p>
<p>An ocean view, an infamous former owner</p>
<p>It boasts ocean views, an infamous former owner – and now a buyer willing to pay more than $8.75-million (U.S.).</p>
<p>An unidentified buyer or buyers snapped up Bernard Madoff’s Long Island beach house within days after the U.S. Marshals Service put the seized property up for sale, a spokeswoman for the broker the Corcoran Group said Thursday.</p>
<p>Spokeswoman Anne Lacombe said the fallen money manager’s Montauk retreat was under contract for more than its $8.75-million asking price. She didn’t have the exact figure, any information on the intended buyer or the closing date.</p>
<p>The U.S. Marshals Service put the 3,000-square-foot house on the market Sept. 1 to help repay victims of Madoff’s massive investment fraud. The agency didn’t immediately return a phone call Thursday.</p>
<p>The listing attracted an onslaught of responses and numerous bids, Lacombe said. She said the highest bid was taken.</p>
<p>Madoff’s notoriety “made it come to a lot of people’s attention, but it’s really all about the location of the views and the home,” she said.</p>
<p>The four-bedroom house is set on a 1.2-acre lot amid the dunes in Montauk, a windswept beach community east of the Hamptons. The house is modest by Hamptons standards, but it boasts stunning views of the Atlantic Ocean and sits closer to the surf than zoning laws now allow.</p>
<p>Madoff, 71, was sentenced in June to 150 years in prison for orchestrating a Ponzi scheme that encompassed thousands of investors and billions of dollars.</p>
<p>His punishment included a forfeiture order that stripped him and his wife, Ruth, of nearly all their wealth. The order gave the marshals authority to seize and sell the Madoffs’ homes.</p>

<p>What is a stalking horse bid?</p>
<p>A stalking horse bid is an initial proposal to buy an asset from a distressed company (most often one that is bankrupt or in bankruptcy protection). Usually, the company or its receiver will select a buyer willing to make an offer. The idea is to establish a minimum price for the asset, by getting a first bid out in the open. This keeps lowball offers off the table and sets up a competitive bidding process. The stalking horse bidder usually gets a break fee if it doesn't end up as the eventual winner.</p>
<p>Where does the term come from?</p>
<p>A stalking horse was originally a horse, or something that looked like a horse, that was set out across a field by hunters. The hunters would hide behind it, so that whatever they were hunting would be less likely to get spooked. It has evolved to mean anything that is put forward or proposed anonymously, or through a third party, to test the waters or mask the real plan. The term “stalking horse” originated way back in the 16th century. The idea of a stalking horse bid is a lot more recent. It is called that because it is a way to draw other bidders out of the bushes.</p>
<p>Where has the process been used recently?</p>
<p>There was talk of using a stalking horse bid to set up a sale of some of General Motors' assets when the car maker was in bankruptcy protection last spring. Recently, the stalking horse bidder for Nortel Network's enterprise business, Avaya Inc., won the final auction for those assets. Richard Blackwell</p>

<p>Health Canada says the body bags sent to flu-stricken reserves in Manitoba were part of "routine restocking."</p>
<p>Jim Wolfe, with the First Nations and Inuit health branch, says the body bags were part of a shipment of supplies intended for reserves to use over the winter.</p>
<p>He says reserves often have suicides, drownings and other deaths that require the body bags.</p>
<p>Wolfe says the department over-estimated how many bags would be needed by some reserves in preparation for the second wave of swine flu expected this fall.</p>
<p>He says Health Canada regrets the incident and apologizes to all First Nations for any alarm the shipment caused.</p>
<p>The federal health minister has formally ordered a probe into why the government sent the body bags with other flu supplies, calling what happened "insensitive and offensive."</p>

<p>These are scary days for vulnerable First Nations communities across Canada, as the flu season closes in. They have fairly begged Ottawa to beef up health personnel and equipment, and to speed up deliveries of H1N1 vaccines, Tamiflu, sanitizers, face masks, gloves, thermometers, acetaminophen and other supplies.</p>
<p>So what did they get by way of comfort from the federal government?</p>
<p>Body bags.</p>
<p>Health Canada's Manitoba office couldn't have chosen a more inappropriate moment to ship some 200 bags to remote communities that were hard hit by flu in the spring. They were delivered in a routine prewinter restocking exercise, primarily for use in fatal accidents, and were not "linked exclusively" to H1N1, officials say. Still, at a time when native leaders are appealing for preventive measures, and when Ottawa is shipping in "flu kits," the cargo of body bags was insensitive, unnecessary and unwelcome.</p>
<p>Garden Hill First Nation Chief David Harper wondered aloud what Ottawa's message was. "Is Canada giving up on the First Nations?" he asked. "This says to me they've given up." In many native cultures, he pointed out, to prepare for death as Health Canada did is to invite it.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, herself a native Canadian, initially seemed flummoxed by the controversy. By yesterday, however, she had found her voice. "As minister of health and as an aboriginal, I am offended," she said in a statement. "To all who took offence at what occurred, I want to say that I share your concern and I pledge to get to the bottom of it."</p>
<p>That didn't satisfy Parliament, where opposition members yesterday berated the government for callousness.</p>
<p>Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff urged a "simple, frank and human apology" from the minister. That's the least First Nations deserve.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time federal health bureaucrats have come under fire for callousness. Last spring, Health Canada delayed shipping hand sanitizer to hard-hit communities for fear that First Nations people would drink the alcohol-laden cleanser. The body bags add insult to insensitivity.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Minister stops short of apology for body bags -</b>
</div><div>By Mary Agnes Welch    </div>

</p>
<p>FEDERAL Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq stopped short of apologizing Thursday for shipments of body bags that arrived earlier this week at several northern Manitoba reserves bracing for the the looming H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Though senior staff in the health department said sorry, the health minister said she still needed time to investigate the matter.</p>
<p>"I'm very concerned about what happened," said Aglukkaq told reporters while meeting with her provincial counterparts in the city. "I need to get to the bottom of the situation. I've asked my staff to investigate it. I am not going to make any assumptions on the matter."</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Jim Wolfe, the Manitoba regional director of the First Nations and Inuit Health branch of Health Canada, said the body bags were part of a routine restocking of nursing stations in remote communities and not exclusively related to the possible pandemic. Health Canada sent enough supplies such as drugs and protective equipment north for three to four months where normally they only send enough for six weeks.</p>
<p>He apologized for the error and said the body bags don't jibe with medical predictions as to the severity of illness expected in remote communities. And he said Health Canada was keeping in mind that some remote reserves can be cut off for days if bad weather closes the airport.</p>
<p>"We regret the alarm this incident has caused," said Wolfe.</p>
<p>It's not clear exactly how many First Nations got the body bags, how many would normally be sent and exactly how many arrived earlier this week.</p>
<p>Four northern reserves -- the three Island Lake communities of Garden Hill, Wasagamack and St. Theresa Point as well as Gods River -- received at least 50 and possibly as many as 200.</p>
<p>That prompted an outcry from First Nations leaders, who said the move suggested Ottawa had given up trying to protect remote reserves from the flu that kills or hospitalizes a disproportionately high number of aboriginals.</p>
<p>Manitoba Grand Chief Ron Evans said a formal apology is in order. The shipment has frightened aboriginal communities, since many residents have interpreted the number of body bags as the number of people Ottawa expects will die during the second wave of H1N1 expected in the fall, he said.</p>
<p>"I was hoping that it was a rumour but it turned out to be true," Evans said. "I was very disturbed and actually frightened that they're actually shipping that number of body bags to the communities. I thought they were preparing for what the experts were predicting. That's the message the communities are receiving."</p>
<p>Aglukkaq was in Winnipeg Thursday for a one-day meeting of the provinces' health ministers who are grappling with pandemic planning.</p>
<p>Manitoba Health Minister Theresa Oswald said ministers didn't spend any time on the body-bag issue at their meeting. But she called the incident "regrettable."</p>
<p>Oswald said the real issue is one of sensitivity at the time when the government is trying to impress upon people the need to stay calm and have confidence in Ottawa's pandemic plan.</p>

<p>THE Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce says the majority of local businesses don't have a pandemic plan in place and it's taking steps to change that.</p>
<p>The chamber announced Thursday it is teaming up with the Central Region of the Disaster Recovery Information Exchange (DRIE) to offer four information sessions and a one-day workshop on how businesses can prepare for a potential H1N1 flu pandemic this fall and winter.</p>
<p>"We want to ensure that the business community has accurate information and is taking the necessary precautions in the event of a pandemic," said Chamber president and CEO Dave Angus. "It's important that businesses are prepared to ensure economic stability and public safety."</p>
<p>Chamber vice-president Chuck Davidson said about 75 to 80 per cent of the chamber's 2,050 members are small and medium-sized firms, and most don't have pandemic plans in place.</p>
<p>Angus said it's not because they don't take the H1N1 threat seriously. Rather, it's because they don't know where to get the information they need to prepare a proper contingency plan that could be put into effect in the event that their workforces or their operations are seriously disrupted by the flu.</p>
<p>"They really do require as many tools as they can get and as much information as they can get to deal with these issues," he said.</p>
<p>"We don't want to be alarmist because we don't know exactly what kind of impact it (an H1N1 outbreak) will have. But it's just good preparation. Every company should have some kind of disaster plan in place."</p>
<p>Angus said even if an H1N1 pandemic fails to materialize, businesses can still use their pandemic plan as a framework for dealing with other emergencies that may arise in the future.</p>
<p>DRIE is a non-profit association of professionals dedicated to the exchange of information on all aspects of business continuity management, from emergency response to the resumption of business as normal.</p>

<p>THE arrival of months' worth of body bags was alarming to the people of some northern Manitoba First Nations communities looking for hard evidence Health Canada can help them keep loved ones safe when H1N1 hits this fall (30 body bags to the Wasagamack reserve, with a population of about 1,400). The federal department's explanation was that it is sending large stocks of routine supplies so such details do not complicate health services during an epidemic.</p>
<p>The gesture of bureaucratic efficiency, insensitive at worst, was milked by opposition parties who declared it a sign the Harper government has little else to offer to vulnerable reserve residents. It was unhelpful for the larger task before First Nations, especially remote ones, that are vulnerable due to the prevalence of chronic diseases.</p>
<p>First Nations leaders are wondering why the federal government believes 86 per cent of Manitoba bands are ready for a pandemic. Grand Chief Ron Evans, of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, says bands are trying to prepare but are hamstrung by a lack of money. They have been working on the general check list for pandemic planning from federal government, but have no way of putting the pieces into place without financial assistance, Mr. Evans said. Health budgets were not set to accommodate the additional expense incurred by following instructions of Annex B, the part of the country's national pandemic plan written specifically for First Nation communities.</p>
<p>The plan sets out the necessary contingencies to ensure that sufficient equipment, medicine, facilities and people are mustered during a local epidemic. As Mr. Evans noted, however, it is useless to stage an available building to take an overflow of patients or to order refrigeration trucks to work as makeshift morgues if there is no money to pay for it.</p>
<p>The federal and provincial governments announced this week their list for the high-risk Canadians who will get priority for vaccinations and aboriginal people in rural, isolated communities will be among them. The list's appearance is some reassurance that a pandemic plan is poised to move off the pages of a manual.</p>
<p>First Nations communities need more help to take their plans off the drawing board. Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq needs to help them find the funds and resources they will need if their communities are shut off by weather, overwhelmed by patients or lose other critical services due to H1N1 in the coming months.</p>

</p>
<p>WINNIPEG -- Despite a rare Health Canada apology, first nations leaders demanded the resignation of a high-ranking ministry official yesterday after a bungle in which hundreds of body bags were shipped to northern Manitoba communities as flu-fighting supplies.</p>
<p>Postmortem kits – each containing a polyethylene body bag, chin strap, tie straps and identification tags – started arriving at remote nursing stations this week by the dozen. Upwards of 200 bags were shipped throughout remote reserves in northern Manitoba. One community alone – Wasagamack First Nation, 600 kilometres north of Winnipeg – received 30.</p>
<p>Horrified chiefs returned many of the bags to Health Canada on Wednesday, calling them an affront toward aboriginal values that say preparing for death is akin to tempting fate.</p>
<p>“It was insulting,” said David Harper, Grand Chief of the Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, which represents 30 northern aboriginal communities. “Body bags may be part of flu preparations, but so is medications. Why do we get body bags before we get medication?”</p>
<p>In a surprising move yesterday, a high-ranking Health Canada official offered an apology for the shipments. “We regret the alarm caused by the stocking of this particular item,” said Jim Wolfe, regional director for the ministry's First Nations and Inuit Health Branch. “Our apology is to all first nations.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wolfe explained that the shipment was part of a “routine” but “excessive” restocking of nursing stations. “In this case, we overestimated,” he said. “It's unfortunate that this has been linked exclusively with H1N1. Whether it's a nursing station in a remote first nations community in northern Manitoba, or a hospital in downtown Vancouver, supplies are constantly being restocked to prepare for unknown and unforeseen events, whether it be a plane crash, environmental disaster or pandemic.”</p>
<p>Native leaders rejected the explanation and the apology yesterday before calling on Mr. Wolfe to resign. “The people in our nursing stations are telling us they have never seen a body bag shipment, so there's nothing routine about this,” Mr. Harper said. “We do not accept his apology. We have seen these mistakes time and again. He has to go.”</p>
<p>While Mr. Wolfe issued a ministerial apology, his boss did not share the sentiment. Attending a conference with provincial and territorial health ministers in Winnipeg, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said she was troubled by the body bag delivery, but flatly refused to apologize.</p>
<p>“It's disturbing to me and I want to get to the bottom of it,” she said. “Whether this was routine or not, I don't know.”</p>
<p>She has asked her deputy minister to investigate the matter and promised to make the results public.</p>
<p>Until an apology comes directly from the minister's lips, native leaders say they cannot accept it. “It should be made by the minister herself,” said Ron Evans, Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs. “It's under her watch. She has to take responsibility.”</p>
<p>The mild flu outbreak in spring erupted into a full-blown disaster on many aboriginal reserves in the country. At one point, two-thirds of all Manitoba flu patients on respirators were aboriginal, and aboriginal leaders were clamouring for supplies to fight the virus. With many experts forecasting a fall resurgence of the illness, some chiefs expect the worst is yet to come.</p>
<p>“To send 30 bags to one community is enough to frighten us all,” Mr. Evans said. “Not just first nations.”</p>

<p>‘Stupid” is the only word for it. If the Health Canada bureaucracy thinks that sending body bags to Manitoba's native communities at the same time as hand sanitizers, gloves and masks is the way to inspire confidence in federal leadership on H1N1, it could not be more wrong. This seemed to be either someone's ghoulish sense of humour, or Ottawa fears 1918 all over again. What does it know, as one native leader asked, that it isn't telling us?</p>
<p>But maybe it was just stupid, and nothing more. Much more troubling is that Canada's Public Health Agency finally got around on Wednesday to releasing its priority list for vaccination against swine flu. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a list on July 29. The World Health Organization came out with a list on July 13. The Canadian release was long-awaited – too long; with an epidemic perhaps just weeks away, the country's health leaders inexplicably required scads of time to cobble together the obvious.</p>
<p>Now Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, in deep damage-control mode, has ordered an inquiry into the shipment of body bags. But leadership demands more than a promise from the Health Minister to get to the bottom of the strangely timed shipment. It demands readiness. The minister's inquiry should ask urgently why Canada's priority list landed nearly two months after the U.S. one. Does this mean Canada's ability to roll out the vaccine will suffer from a similar time lag? Will those at the most risk be immunized in time? Will this country perpetually be playing catch-up to other developed countries?</p>
<p>Ms. Aglukkaq should also be asking what is the plan to actually vaccinate the millions on the priority list, and why, on her watch, Health Canada is bungling its efforts to protect aboriginal communities, who will inevitably be hit hard in a severe outbreak, because of crowded living conditions and widespread ill health.</p>
<p>By yesterday afternoon, Health Canada announced that the body-bag shipments were a routine preparation for the unforeseen, and had nothing to do with H1N1. At the very least, the irony is discomfiting. Officials debated for weeks about sending alcohol-based sanitizers to northern communities, during the initial outbreak of swine flu in the spring, leaving anxious communities without emergency supplies such as flu masks and respirators. Yet they move with alacrity to distribute receptacles for the dead.</p>
<p>Some mistakes annoy, others unnerve. These events shine a worrisome light on the government's command of an urgent public-health matter.</p>

<p>The federal government admitted Thursday that it was insensitive to send body bags in a shipment of medical supplies to First Nations communities awaiting help to prepare for the fall flu season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, officials said the shipment in no way reflected how severely they expected the swine flu virus to hit native communities this fall.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, who on Wednesday ordered an investigation into the controversy, followed up Thursday with a statement saying as an aboriginal person she was offended and that what happened was "unacceptable."</p>
<p>"To all who took offence at what occurred, I want to say that I share your concern and I pledge to get to the bottom of it," said Aglukkaq, who was attending a meeting in Winnipeg with her provincial and territorial counterparts.</p>
<p>In her absence from the House of Commons, other Conservative MPs faced the storm of criticisms levelled by opposition parties.</p>
<p>"What happened was inexcusable. It was unfortunate; it was regrettable; it was incredibly insensitive," said Transport Minister John Baird.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq's statement stopped short of the personal apology that Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff called on the minister to make. But, later in the day her department issued a full-fledged mea culpa and sought to explain why the body bags were sent to communities including the Wasagamack First Nation.</p>
<p>"Health Canada apologizes for the error that was made in the number of body bags that were ordered for the Wasagamack First Nations. We regret the alarm that this incident has caused," said the statement.</p>

<p>The federal government has sent a message to aboriginals that it expects them to die from the swine flu and Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq should offer an apology for the dozens of body bags that were sent to several First Nations communities in Manitoba, Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said Thursday.</p>

<p>Toronto has seen a sharp drop in reported cases of H1N1 in July and August but that's mostly because doctors are no longer testing for the virus. The number of confirmed H1N1 cases peaked in June at 1,001, dropping to about 130 in July and then six in August when testing was limited to patients who needed to be hospitalized. "We stopped testing so those numbers aren't going to reflect what's out there," said Rishma Govani, spokeswoman for Toronto Public Health. "It's estimated that it may be 10 times more." When the virus broke out this spring, doctors were testing people who showed flu-like symptoms in order to establish the nature of the virus. Now H1N1 testing and case-counting practices have fallen in line with those of seasonal influenza, where only cases where hospitalization is required are recorded by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.</p>

</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper touted the virtues of Canada's economic strength in the face of a global recession as he spoke before business leaders from both sides of the border in New York City yesterday.</p>
<p>"None of the roots of the recession are to be found in Canada," Mr. Harper said last night in a speech hosted by the Canadian-American Business Council and the Canadian Association of New York.</p>
<p>"And Canada, while it has been significantly impacted, is emerging from the global recession in a strong position.... If we stay on course, Canada's future has never looked so bright."</p>
<p>Mr. Harper noted that, proportionally, Canada has lost less than half as many jobs than the United States has over the past 18 months and was the last major industrialized country to be dragged into the global recession.</p>
<p>"To paraphrase Warren Buffett, as the tide went out, the crisis exposed those who had been swimming naked," he said. "And it turns out that Canada was not only no skinny dipper, it was one of the strongest swimmers."</p>
<p>Mr. Harper credited Canada's strong financial sector, its "unwavering commitment" to free trade, and his government's implementation of an economic stimulus package for its relatively healthy position compared to the United States and many other countries.</p>
<p>He cited the protectionist "Buy America" provision that U. S. lawmakers attached to their US$787-billion economic stimulus bill, as he said Canada is "redoubling our efforts to keep trade flowing."</p>
<p>But it appears the Prime Minister has yet to receive a commitment from U. S. lawmakers -- which he sought in meetings earlier yesterday -- to exempt Canada from the "Buy American" provisions.</p>
<p>During a question-and-answer period after his remarks, Mr. Harper said Canada has a proposal before U. S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk. He also said U. S. lawmakers indicated Canada was not a target of the provision. Mr. Harper also met with U. S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday. They agreed that economic integration is a fundamental source of strength for both economies, but Mr. Harper seemed to make little specific progress on trade.</p>
<p>"Ours is not only the largest two-way trading relationship in human history, not only one of its most enduring alliances, but it is a deep friendship unmatched by any other two nations," he told the group of business leaders in New York. "But like any relationship, it still requires care, dialogue and understanding."</p>
<p>Mr. Harper received some of the loudest applause when he said that under his administration, Tax Freedom Day now arrives 20 days earlier. "Some of you must be paying taxes in Canada," he quipped.</p>
<p>"Historically, we Canadians have been known as a polite, quiet and self-effacing people," he concluded in his prepared remarks. "But in my view -- as you may have noticed -- this is no time to hide our light under a bushel.... We have all suffered from the global economic recession -- but Canada's management of its economy and financial system is a success story of which we can be justifiably proud, and on which we can build."</p>

<p>Re: Doctors Protect Pay From Swine Flu, Sept. 14.</p>
<p>This article brings to light fees up to $518 per hour negotiated in Alberta for physicians to care for patients suffering from influenza. While I appreciate the increased risk associated with front-line health care workers during a pandemic, the potential to earn over $4,000 for an eight-hour shift seems excessive during a time in which our government is implementing health care budget cuts throughout Canada. Further, this announcement comes weeks after B. C.'s provincial health officer, Dr. Perry Kendall, said the province will not pay additional medical costs for protective masks and gowns for doctors and nurses on the front line of a pandemic.</p>
<p>As an licenced practical nurse and a four-year nursing student, I have seen first-hand the effectiveness of primary prevention tactics and the hazards associated when personal protective equipment is unavailable due to budget shortfalls. I agree that physicians may be at increased risk of falling ill during a pandemic and they deserve special considerations. However, all front-line workers from nurses to janitorial staff are similarly at risk during an outbreak.</p>
<p>Instead of petitioning for increased pay we should all be advocating for improved working conditions, availability of personal protective equipment and funds to educate the public on how to prevent the spread of infection.</p>

<div>435 words</div><div>18 September 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p>Not only was it in "poor taste" for Health Canada to ship body bags to remote Manitoba First Nations communities along with other H1N1 flu-outbreak supplies, it was unprecedented and unnecessary, according to the director of Winnipeg's Aboriginal Funeral Chapel.</p>
<p>In his four years as director of the chapel, which deals almost exclusively with the province's northern reserves, Peter Kilcollins has never heard of Ottawa sending body bags to remote nursing stations.</p>
<p>"Body bags are provided by the funeral home, the RCMP, or the medical examiner's office," Mr. Kilcollins said, adding that he handles roughly 200 funeral services each year for deaths that occur in communities such as Garden Hill, Red Sucker Lake and God's River.</p>
<p>"We often leave a body bag or two at the nursing station so they have one on hand, just to ensure there's one there when the time comes."</p>
<p>Mr. Kilcollins also said there are daily scheduled flights to and from these communities, so it is easy for his chapel to respond to requests for supplies on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>"When we do get a call specifically asking for a body bag -- which happens maybe once a year -- we can easily ship one up in a very short amount of time," Mr. Kilcollins said.</p>
<p>His comments came as Leona Aglukkaq, the Minister of Health, ordered an investigation into how and why the dozens of body bags were shipped to the northern reserves as part of H1N1 preparation.</p>
<p>"It was insensitive and offensive. As Minister of Health and as an aboriginal, I am offended," she said in a written statement. "To all who took offence at what occurred, I want to say that I share your concern and I pledge to get to the bottom of it. I have ordered my deputy minister to conduct a thorough and immediate inquiry into the situation. I will make the result of the inquiry public."</p>
<p>Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said the Minister must apologize for a mistake that sends a message of "deep disrespect" to Canadians.</p>
<p>"The Minister cannot blame it on the bureaucrats. This is a matter of direct ministerial responsibility, and it sends a message that simply says, we expect aboriginal Canadians to die," he said.</p>

</p>
<p>Canada's public health officials are recommending those at greatest risk of complications from H1N1 flu -- people under 65 with chronic conditions, pregnant women, children six months to less than five years, and those living in remote communities -- should be among the first to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>The vaccine guidelines are designed to minimize sickness and deaths and keep society functioning, should a much anticipated second wave of swine flu actually hit.</p>
<p>"Our basic approach is to ensure those that need it most get it first," Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said in a briefing Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ultimately, enough vaccine will be available to vaccinate everyone who needs, and wants, to be immunized, Butler-Jones said. "No one will be left out."</p>
<p>"The challenge is to ensure that those who benefit the most will get it as quickly as possible."</p>
<p>But Ottawa's guidance to provinces and territories on where the first wave of vaccines should go comes amid growing concerns the shots will arrive too late to immunize even vulnerable groups, and to slow the epidemic.</p>
<p>The first vaccinations are not scheduled to begin until early November. American researchers are warning substantial spread of H1N1 is expected to begin this month, with the epidemic peaking in mid- to late- October.</p>
<p>The government says groups who would benefit most from immunization include:</p>
<p>- People under 65 with such chronic medical conditions as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, cancer and immune-system problems. So far, people over 65 are less affected by H1N1, possibly because they were likely exposed to a distant cousin of H1N1 that circulated in the 1950s and have some immunity.</p>
<p>- Pregnant women.</p>
<p>- Children six months to under five years of age (healthy children, six to 23 months of age, are at particular risk of severe disease and hospitalization, Butler-Jones said, and are a focus of this target group).</p>
<p>- People living in remote and isolated communities who have limited access to medical care.</p>
<p>- Health-care workers involved in pandemic response or who deliver essential health services.</p>
<p>- Household contacts and caregivers of people who are at high risk who can't be immunized (such as infants under six months of age or people with weakened immune systems).</p>
<p>The groups together total an estimated seven million people.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said that, by the third week of October, between seven and 10 million doses of vaccine should be available in Canada, and 3.5 million doses will be produced each week thereafter.</p>
<p>"So when we pull the trigger, to say, 'OK, we're confident in the vaccine, it's time to go forward,' early November or whenever it occurs, we should have enough to meet those people's needs and more, very quickly."</p>
<p>Others who would benefit from immunization, according to the government, include children between five and 18 years of age. "They have some of the higher attack rates and are a source of transmission to others," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>Other groups include police, firefighters and other first responders; poultry and swine workers, to prevent the possibility of viruses mixing, which would create new problems; adults aged 19 to 64, who have an increased risk of developing severe H1N1 disease compared to older adults; and adults 65 and older who, while they have lower attack rates, can still experience severe disease.</p>
<p>The challenge will be convincing people to get vaccinated. Butler-Jones said polls suggest anywhere from 40 to 65 per cent of the population say they would get the shots.</p>
<p>"We don't get (H1N1) just 'out there;' we get it from another person, and another person had to be ill, and that person who could have been immunized could have been not ill, could have prevented that infection, (which) could mean that my grandmother or my sister did not die," he said.</p>
<p>"Getting immunized is a key strategy, at the end of the day, to stop this pandemic and minimize its effects."</p>
<p>On Monday, vaccine-maker <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> announced its pandemic vaccine induced a strong immune response after a single dose in a trial involving 130 healthy adults.</p>
<p>Canada ordered 50.4 million vaccine doses, based on the assumption two doses would be needed, and that 60 per cent of the population would need, or want it.</p>
<p>But concerns have been raised that people could be exposed to an incompletely tested vaccine as officials rush to get the shots out ahead of the disease.</p>
<p>As well, the pandemic hasn't reached the overall level of severity planners had predicted, or expected from a pandemic flu. Officials also can't be sure, so far, the overall mortality or severity is much different from regular seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Most patients infected with the pandemic virus have mild symptoms and recover fully within a week, even without medical treatment. New data presented Wednesday of a meeting of flu experts held by the U.S Institute of Medicine suggest the death rate is on the magnitude of that for a moderate flu season.</p>

</p>
<p>Ottawa --</p>
<p>Michael Ignatieff says the message from the government is simple: “We expect aboriginal Canadians to die.”</p>
<p>The Liberal leader is outraged over the government's handling of the H1N1 pandemic in aboriginal communities, especially the latest controversy: delivering body bags to remote Manitoba reserves as a way to deal with a second wave of the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>In an unusual early morning scrum, Mr. Ignatieff demanded a personal apology from Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>He called the move “callous.”</p>
<p>“It sends a message that simply says ‘we expect aboriginal Canadians to die' and when it's combined with the fact ? that they haven't sent preventative measures that can save those lives, it sends a message of a callous lack of compassion,” Mr. Ignatieff said.</p>
<p>“I am genuinely shocked.”</p>
<p>Standing outside his Centre Block office, Mr. Ignatieff also addressed the developing situation in Parliament. Both NDP leader Jack Layton and Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe say they will support the government in a confidence motion expected tomorrow.</p>
<p>The support of the two opposition parties ensures the survival, at least for now, of the minority Harper government.</p>
<p>The Liberals have decided not to continue their support. Mr. Ignatieff said his party will be putting forward a non-confidence motion in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>“What other parties do is their business,” he said. “For me this is not a matter of elections. This is a matter of whether I am doing my job on behalf of Canadians, which is to hold this government to account.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the body-bag issue will likely dominate the daily 45-minute Question Period this afternoon.</p>
<p>The Ignatieff Liberals have repeatedly criticized the government for not having a plan to deal with what is expected to be another wave of H1N1. The criticism speaks to the narrative they are trying to build that the Harper government is uncaring, and treats its citizens here and abroad with little compassion.</p>
<p>Mr. Ignatieff said this morning that First Nations communities are extremely vulnerable to the flu and should have “priority inoculation and we still don't have the vaccine available.</p>
<p>“We feel that the minister has been sending out her bureaucrats when what is required is a simple, frank and human apology to Canadians,” he said. “This is just not good enough.”</p>

<p>First Nations chiefs in northern Manitoba say Health Canada sent an ominous message to their reserves this week when dozens of body bags were included in shipments of medical supplies for H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said yesterday she's ordered an investigation into the "disturbing" reports of body-bag shipments to First Nations communities hit hard by the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>At least four reserves in Manitoba reported they received body bags in shipments from Health Canada on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"This says to me they've given up," said Garden Hill Chief David Harper.</p>
<p>Harper said Wasagamack First Nation counted at least 30 body bags in a shipment of supplies sent to the nursing station. God's River received 20 of them. Garden Hill and St. Theresa Point also had body bags in their supply shipments, but hadn't counted them.</p>
<p>"This is an ominous sign that the government is predicting a grim outcome," said Chief David McDougall of St. Theresa Point First Nation.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said she did not know anything about the body-bag shipment, including whether or not Health Canada was actually behind it.</p>
<p>"Once I have more information, I can speak to that," she said. "Right now, I'm asking the same questions you are."</p>
<p>The federal government, which is responsible for health care on First Nations, has faced criticism over its response to flu outbreaks on the reserves this spring.</p>
<p>Calling a swine-flu outbreak in their communities a "pending atrocity," three chiefs from northern Manitoba travelled to Ottawa in June to demand a meeting with the federal health and Indian affairs ministers.</p>
<p>The chiefs said their fly-in communities were more vulnerable to an outbreak, partly because many overcrowded houses do not have access to running water.</p>

<p>WINNIPEG</p>
<p>Aboriginal leaders in Manitoba say they are horrified and want an explanation as to why some of the reserves hardest hit by swine flu in the spring have just received dozens of body bags from Health Canada.</p>
<p>Chiefs say the body bags -- which were in a shipment of hand sanitizers and face masks -- were sent to a cluster of remote northern reserves where dozens of patients were airlifted to hospital in the spring."If this is preparedness, they're sending the wrong message to our communities. Who would do such a thing?" Grand Chief David Harper, who represents Manitoba's northern First Nations, said yesterday.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said at a flu briefing in Ottawa that she was disturbed when she heard body bags had been sent to some aboriginal communities.</p>
<p>"I have ordered my deputy minister to conduct a thorough and immediate inquiry into the situation and I will continue to work with First Nations, provinces and territories."</p>

</p>
<p>First Nations chiefs in northern Manitoba say Health Canada sent an ominous message to their reserves this week when dozens of body bags were included in shipments of medical supplies for H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Wednesday she's ordered an investigation into the "disturbing" reports of body-bag shipments to First Nations communities hit hard by the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>At least four reserves in Manitoba reported they received body bags in shipments from Health Canada on Tuesday. The shipments also included hand sanitizer and face masks.</p>
<p>"This says to me they've given up," said Garden Hill Chief David Harper.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said she learned about the body bags in a conference call with First Nations leaders Wednesday morning. "I have ordered my deputy minister to conduct a thorough and immediate inquiry into the situation," she said.</p>
<p>Manitoba MP and NDP health critic Judy Wasylycia-Leis called the shipment "the ultimate expression of incompetence. This is a government that won't send flu kits to these reserves, but they send body bags, instead," she said. "We find this absolutely abhorrent."</p>
<p>Nationally, First Nations patients account for 17 per cent of the hospitalized cases of H1N1 and 11.3 per cent of the deaths.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Cancer, H1N1 research at risk after cuts; Victoria giving Michael Smith Foundation only half of promised funding</b>
</div><div>Rob Shaw   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>608 words</div><div>17 September 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Critical research on the H1N1 virus and cancer prevention in B.C. might end because one of the province's leading health research foundations failed to receive half its provincial funding this year.</p>
<p>The Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research, which supports more than a thousand health researchers in hospitals and universities across B.C., said two of its major research units are at risk because the provincial government provided less money than it promised earlier this year.</p>
<p>The foundation is already alerting researchers that their work to help develop a swine flu vaccination policy for health authorities, along with research for certain types of cancer in at-risk families, would not be sustainable with funding cuts.</p>
<p>"If we don't have any additional monies we won't be able to take those studies any further," said John Challis, president and CEO. Numerous other research programs, fellowships and scholarship awards are "contingent on additional funding" after March 31, 2010, he said.</p>
<p>Specifically, Challis said support for crucial work by Dr. David Huntsman would have to be scaled back. Huntsman is working to identify genes that cause stomach, breast and ovarian cancer in certain at-risk families.</p>
<p>NDP health critic Adrian Dix said the cuts are shameful.</p>
<p>"You're talking about long-term damage to research in British Columbia and a specific contradiction of a long-standing commitment government has made to research. This decision damages health research in B.C., it's going to lead to a brain drain from the province, it damages the economy and it represents yet another act of deceit."</p>
<p>The province created the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research in 2001 as a way to attract top-tier health researchers to B.C. In almost every throne speech, the government points to the foundation as proof of provincial investment in world-class research. The Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre was the first to crack the genetic code of the SARS virus, which has led to vaccine development.</p>
<p>The B.C. government has spent more than $260 million on the foundation in the past eight years, money used to leverage additional federal research grants.</p>
<p>The foundation requested $30 million in its budget earlier this year, said Challis. The province provided $15 million in cash in April. But an additional $15 million disappeared when government tabled its budget update in September.</p>
<p>B.C. Health Minister Kevin Falcon said he's "fully expecting" the province can somehow find the extra cash. "I remain very confident they'll be able to get the full amount of money," he said, but acknowledged the money is not coming as quickly as the foundation had hoped, and has led to uncertainty.</p>
<p>Challis said he's "encouraged" by Falcon's comments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Children's Minister Mary Polak announced Wednesday she's killing the intensive early intervention program for autistic children in seven communities. The decision affects 70 pre-school children and reduces the money each receives for treatment from $70,000 a year to $20,000.</p>
<p>Polak said more than 800 other autistic children under six in B.C. receive only $20,000 a year. Giving a small group of children an extra $50,000 each year is unfair and failed to produce results, she said.</p>
<p>Polak said the ministry will use the $5 million saved by scrapping the program to boost treatment money for autistic children under six from $20,000 to $22,000 as of April 1.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canyon of fire and flood; The awesome, tragic beauty of Arizona's Lake Powell</b>
</div><div>Roberta Avery   </div>
<div>Special to the Star</div>
<div>909 words</div><div>17 September 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>T01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>PAGE , Ariz. -- The little old lady spoke with a honey-sweet voice, so the string of swear words that poured out of her mouth came as a shock.</p>
<p>They were also as a testament to the anger she still feels nearly half a century later about the flooding of Glen Canyon.</p>
<p>"They drowned it, they *! @ ing drowned it," said Katie Lee, fighting back tears.</p>
<p>The former Hollywood starlet, singer, songwriter and environmental activist turns 90 this year, but her unwavering commitment to her principles is directed at trying to get Lake Powell drained so that the Colorado River can once again run wild.</p>
<p>In Lee's day, Glen Canyon - the Grand Canyon's South Rim is about 200 kilometres to the southwest - was an unspoiled beauty spot.</p>
<p>It attracted hardy back-country types, such as Lee. In spite of her efforts, which included using nude photographs of herself posing in Glen Canyon to gain the public's attention, the dam across the Colorado River opened in 1964 and her beloved canyon was flooded.</p>
<p>My meeting with Lee after she gave a talk in Sedona, Ariz., had been brief, but I remembered her words months later as I saw Lake Powell for the first time.</p>
<p>"It doesn't belong there," Lee had said, and seeing the vast expanse of blue-green water against a backdrop of the terra cotta and vermillion hues of the desert, it was easy to see her point of view.</p>
<p>Lake Powell stretches more than 300 kilometres across the Arizona/Utah border and is the second largest man-made lake in the United States.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to appreciate the magnitude of the project is to take a cruise down one of the more than 200 side canyons flooded when the dam was created.</p>
<p>Captain Jim has made the trip down Antelope Canyon numerous times, but as he manoeuvres the tour boat down the narrow canyon between the towering red rock walls dappled with burgundy tones, it's clear he is still in awe.</p>
<p>"Do you know there is nearly 2,000 miles of shoreline like this on Lake Powell, that's more shoreline than on the east coast of the United States," he says adding that the water is more than 100 metres deep.</p>
<p>On average, the hydro electric plant powered by the dam produces about 451 megawatts of electricity which is enough to supply the city of Phoenix.</p>
<p>Ironically, the three 236-metre tall cooling towers of the nearby coal-powered Navajo Generation Station, which dominate the landscape, wouldn't be there if Lake Powell didn't exist to supply a ready source of water.</p>
<p>The Navajo plant puts out more than four times the electricity as the dam.</p>
<p>Today, Lake Powell and the nearby town of Page attract more than three million visitors annually who come to take lake cruises, fish, stay on one of the many houseboats or to swim from the sandy shores.</p>
<p>Visitors have also discovered the beauty of the nearby slot canyons and the local Navajo people have developed a thriving industry taking jeeps full of tourists out to see these natural wonders.</p>
<p>A favourite is the dry section of Antelope Canyon beyond the point where the waters of Lake Powell reach. It was here in 1997 that 11 tourists died when a freak flood crashed through the narrow canyon.</p>
<p>Tour leader Len Nez says that Navajo tradition forbade his people to walk in the slot canyons.</p>
<p>"We believed you got sick from it, now they pay us, so for money we come here, but we ask the medicine man to perform a ceremony for us first, so no one gets sick," he says.</p>
<p>It's truly a wondrous place. The narrow towering walls twist, spiral and curve to create an awe-inspiring display of light and colour.</p>
<p>In places the walls are so close together that you can touch both sides at once and the shafts of sunlight that filter through dance patterns of fiery gold, crimson and purple.</p>
<p>The downside is that with so many tour groups, the peace and tranquillity of this special place is destroyed by the crowds elbowing their way through.</p>
<p>I visited at the height of the swine flu epidemic so being in such close quarters with so many people is somewhat nerve wracking.</p>
<p>I can only hope that the medicine man's ceremony has worked.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Reader emails his radar rage - Unmarked vehicle not enforcing law or safety, driver complains</b>
</div><div>Gordon Sinclair Jr.    </div>
<div>733 words</div><div>17 September 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>THE ISSUE THAT WON'T GO AWAY... I'm sure that whoever came up with the idea of placing photo-radar vehicles in construction zones did it with workers' safety in mind.</p>
<p>But, alas, that noble intent became a community controversy when many vehicle owners were ticketed, even after the workers had gone home.</p>
<p>The issue really took off, though, when a traffic-court magistrate tossed nine construction-zone tickets. And the Crown stayed 875 outstanding cases because signs in construction zones were illegally placed. The province didn't appeal the decision. But it didn't refund the fines already paid, either.</p>
<p>Which is all backdrop for why, on Tuesday at high noon, a Free Press reader wrote about a photo-radar vehicle at Kenaston Boulevard north of McGillivray Boulevard. His pet peeve is how the vehicles occasionally commit one infraction while capturing others committing another.</p>
<p>He emailed a picture of the photo-radar vehicle "parked in a no-stopping zone (just after the commencement of the 60 zone)."</p>
<p>"Presumably, the no-stopping signs are posted there as a safety measure, which is somewhat compromised with the parked photo---radar vehicle. Some may rightfully argue that law-enforcement vehicles are not bound by the no-parking signs. In that regard, I don't question the need for law-enforcement vehicles doing what they are required to do. A cruiser pulling someone over who is speeding or committing any other infraction has the immediate effect of both enforcing the law and enhancing road safety.</p>
<p>"Conversely, I would argue that an unmarked photo-radar vehicle is not enforcing the law or increasing safety. Rather, it is simply digitally recording vehicles that speed with absolutely no immediate effect to the wrong being committed. That speeding driver is quite free to continue speeding until the cows come home completely oblivious to the fact that the long arm of the law will one day soon reach out and put a touch on his/her wallet.</p>
<p>"If you really want to slow drivers down without expending manpower, simply park an empty cruiser off the side of the road in a highly visible spot -- a practice (once?) often used by the OPP along the 401. Very effective but, unfortunately, not very profitable."</p>
<p>-- John Lumley</p>
<p>As they say, not only must justice be done, it must also be seen to be done.</p>
<p>IF YOU THINK THAT READER WAS OUTRAGED... Another email and more photos arrived Tuesday, this time from Gods River, an isolated northern Manitoba community also known as Manto Sipi Cree Nation.</p>
<p>"You think you have it bad," the email began. "Check this out."</p>
<p>She meant the attached photos.</p>
<p>They featured what the first day of school was like. Students attending classes in a tent. Teachers put up the tent because last July a fire inspector deemed the Amos Okemow Memorial School unsafe.</p>
<p>"Despite the flies, dust, wind and rain," she added, "over 31 Grade 10 students turned up for school Tuesday." The tent simply isn't big enough for all 250 students.</p>
<p>According to my correspondent, Ottawa promised the community a new school in 1987. They're still waiting.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, this week -- in anticipation of an H1N1 influenza outbreak -- Gods River received boxes of hand sanitizer wipes and masks. Plus 20 body bags.</p>
<p>I'm sure the unintended message wasn't lost on the community.</p>
<p>A RANDOM ACT OF PET KINDNESS... Karen Rohr say she's "overwhelmed" by the kindness and support she received from a crowd of strangers on Corydon Avenue Sunday afternoon. Her dog Barney -- an eight-year-old Pomapoo -- suffered a head injury outside <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>. The exuberant Barney fell when he jumped up on her friend while Karen was fetching coffee. Lots of concerned people responded, calling vet clinics, listening for a doggie heartbeat, fashioning a shift gurney and finally driving Karen and Barney to a vet hospital. Originally, the vet said Barney was dying, but Tuesday night Karen took him home.</p>
<p>"Barney is doing better," she said. "But he's still not back to normal."</p>
<p>Karen wanted to say "thank you" to everyone who helped. Which reminds me, don't be shy about posting your own random acts of kindness on the Free Press website.</p>
<p>Thank you kindly, in advance.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>St. B hospital's new ER taking aim at wait times -</b>
</div><div>By Bruce Owen    </div>

</p>
<p>A new emergency room at the St. Boniface General Hospital will reduce wait times for patients and reduce the chance of someone dying while waiting to see a doctor, health officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The $645,000 renovation, unveiled Wednesday, is in response to last year's death of Brian Sinclair at the Health Sciences Centre ER and part of a system-wide response to realign emergency rooms throughout the province so there is increased contact between patients and hospital staff.</p>
<p>Dr. Alecs Chochinov, emergency room medical director at the St. Boniface General Hospital, said the new ER will allow nurses and doctors to treat patients more quickly.</p>
<p>"This is where the care begins for out patients," he said. "It's not simply a pretty ante room."</p>
<p>Health Minister Theresa Oswald said the renovation was triggered by Sinclair's death and a subsequent review of hospital ERs which said sight-lines between staff and patients must be improved so no patient goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>Sinclair, a 45-year-old double amputee, waited in the emergency department for about 34 hours without being examined. A provincial inquest will be held to examine the circumstances leading up to his death. No date has been set.</p>
<p>Oswald said the province is also looking at installing electronic monitors in waiting rooms so patients can see for themselves where they are on the waiting list.</p>
<p>"Having information like, 'I have been waiting for X number of minutes, but now I know that four ambulances have come in and there are four heart attacks that people are working on,'" Oswald said.</p>
<p>"That's good information for me as a patient in understanding why I might need to wait a little longer."</p>
<p>The opposition Tories countered while making Manitoba's ERs more patient-friendly is a step in the right direction, more has to be done to put more nurses on the job and cut down on the high number of patients who walk out of an ER without ever seeing a doctor.</p>
<p>Tory health critic Myrna Driedger said last year 21,406 people left an ER without being treated, up from 19,573 two years earlier, according to figures provided by the Tories through an access to information request.</p>
<p>The total number of visits in 2008-09 were more than 300,000 visits, according to the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority. In this period, the percentage of patients who left without being seen was 7.2 per cent, up from 6.8 per the year before.</p>
<p>Driedger also said the health system is short nurses in ERs and intensive care units, which will only add to problems if the expected H1N1 flu outbreak this fall is widespread. Winnipeg ERs are short 73 nurses, she said.</p>
<p>Oswald said Health Links follows up on some patients by phone who leave hospital ERs to see that they're OK.</p>
<p>"It's not the case in every hospital so far, but we're working to build our capacity towards that," she said.</p>
<p>Oswald said the nursing shortage is a chronic problem across Canada.</p>
<p>She said the shortage of ICU nurses has been reduced in Manitoba with more nurses enrolled in specialize training.</p>

<p>Re: Doctors Protect Pay From Swine Flu, Some Negotiated $518 An Hour To Treat Flu Patients, Sept. 14.</p>
<p>Canadians can depend on their physicians to respond immediately to care for the ill and injured in an emergency. During the SARS epidemic in 2003, doctors dropped their other clinical duties and suspended their personal lives to help bring the epidemic under control.</p>
<p>Analysis of the management of the SARS epidemic has criticized the support and assistance provided to front-line health care workers, particularly doctors, during that crisis. Communication and infrastructure support was poor. There was no financial compensation for those who missed work due to illness or quarantine. Unlike most other health care workers, fee-for-service physicians do not have guaranteed income replacement if they are ill or injured.</p>
<p>Together with physicians' ethical duty to care for the sick, society has a reciprocal obligation to compensate doctors for the burden of personal hardship imposed upon them. According to the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics report, We Stand on Guard for Thee, "reciprocity requires that society support those who face a disproportionate burden in protecting the public good, and take steps to minimize burdens as much as possible. Measures to protect the public good are likely to impose a disproportionate burden on health care workers, patients and their families."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Students target health-care silos; Hypothetical quake an exercise in co-ordination</b>

</p>
<p>As the medical community grapples with the H1N1 threat, a few hundred students played out their own disaster scenario Tuesday.</p>
<p>Medical, health-sciences and paramedic students were asked to take charge of a school severely damaged by a massive, but hypothetical, earthquake that paralysed Ottawa.</p>
<p>It was an exercise in interprofessional co-ordination designed to make these future health workers more aware of their own roles and those of others in different fields.</p>
<p>The exercise was co-ordinated by the Academic Health Council, or AHC, a partnership between regional hospitals, Algonquin College, La Cité Collégiale, and the University of Ottawa's faculties of medicine and health sciences.</p>
<p>The AHC was launched in December 2008, in part to correct a perceived deficiency in medical education -- which, for example, teaches doctors to be doctors, but leaves them unaware of what contributions nurses, paramedics or technicians make.</p>
<p>"We're trying to break the silos," explained Dr. Denis Prud'homme, dean of health sciences at the University of Ottawa and chairman of the AHC.</p>
<p>The students will be more aware of their own roles and better trained to co-ordinate with other health professionals, Prud'homme said.</p>
<p>"Working as a team is much better," and has everyday implications in hospital emergency rooms as well as in crises, when resources are scarce, he said.</p>
<p>Prud'homme was instrumental in forging the alliance between the schools and Champlain region hospitals, which includes medical centres as far away as Hawkesbury and Cornwall, said Tracy Gierman, the AHC's interim director.</p>
<p>She said the network of schools and hospitals is unique in Ontario.</p>
<p>"No one else has been able to do it," she said.</p>
<p>Gierman said medical professionals are a lot happier when they better understand their roles and realize they aren't solely responsible for patients' well-being.</p>
<p>This co-ordination is more valuable and effective than hiring extra medical personnel, she said.</p>
<p>Sabreena Sadat, a first-year medical student at the University of Ottawa, said her professors are already hammering home the benefits of interprofessional collaboration.</p>
<p>Her group -- all University of Ottawa medical students except for one person in fourth-year health sciences -- attacked the earthquake problem with vigour.</p>
<p>"You go in, you triage," first-year medical student Roxanna Mohammed said authoritatively.</p>
<p>"We have to establish some kind of organization," Sadat countered.</p>
<p>Gierman said that although the scenario was abstract, the speedy consensus and tough decisions it required gave the students a taste of what they will face after they graduate.</p>
<p>"For me, the work we're doing now is preparing them to be better equipped to respond to the H1N1 of the future," Gierman said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Many health workers refuse flu shots; Experts wonder how to keep H1N1 from spreading</b>
</div><div>Shelley Page </div>

<div>1275 words</div><div>16 September 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>Chocolate bars, lottery tickets and free lunches.</p>
<p>Many incentives have been tried in hopes of persuading Ottawa hospital workers and others on the front lines to get seasonal flu vaccines, but the numbers who roll up the sleeves of their uniforms stay stubbornly around 50 per cent.</p>
<p>This has public health experts worried and wondering what tack to take this year. Vaccinating Ottawa's health workers to protect patients and also keep hospitals and clinics running is the cornerstone of plans for coping with the H1N1 virus. After all, if doctors, nurses and other health-care workers fall sick at the peak of the pandemic, it could hobble the local health-care system.</p>
<p>Yet many strategies to encourage vaccination have failed. And making shots mandatory will meet with huge resistance, it's predicted.</p>
<p>Ontario paramedics in 2002, for example, threatened to walk off the job en masse if forced to get the seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Health officials have said H1N1 flu shots will not be mandatory, but that has not been the case across the border. New York, which was the first state to be hard-hit by swine flu, is requiring all health workers to get immunized against both seasonal flu and H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"If there is an attempt to make it mandatory, I think you would see civil disobedience," said Michael Hurley, president of the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions, which represents 20,000 hospital workers.</p>
<p>Yet, what, if anything, will persuade half of health-care workers to get vaccinated? Many interviewed revealed a deep-seated reluctance to be vaccinated that stems from their own concerns about vaccine safety, questions about whether or not the flu really is a serious risk, balanced with their own obligation to protect patients they come in contact with.</p>
<p>Hurley said in an interview that health officials should not rely on gimmicks, but instead do a better job of addressing workers' concerns.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure the hospitals or the Ministry of Health spend enough time engaging hospital staff in an informed, intelligent discussion presenting them with the science as it's known," he said. "Putting posters on the wall and having clinics is not the same as taking the time to go over with people the studies that show that mortality rates -- particularly among the elderly -- are reduced when hospital staff had the flu shots."</p>
<p>He said the hospital employees he represents -- 85 per cent of whom are women -- need to understand the safety profile of vaccines, how thoroughly it's been tested, particularly on pregnant women, and the studies that show illness and mortality rates are reduced among hospital patients.</p>
<p>Linda O'Regan, a respiratory therapist at The Ottawa Hospital and a union official with Local 464 of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union, says her union -- which represents 2,300 hospital workers -- and The Ottawa Hospital have tried to encourage seasonal flu vaccination.</p>
<p>Last year, employees could win a free lunch if their department succeeded in having the most employees vaccinated. O'Regan said the hospital hoped to increase vaccination from about 40 per cent to 80 per cent.</p>
<p>"It only went up to about 50 per cent. It was really disappointing," she said. Her local represents radiation therapists, respiratory therapists, radiology technologists, pharmacists, audiologists and social workers, among others.</p>
<p>The various unions at the hospital have also tried to encourage seasonal flu vaccination programs by running publicity campaigns featuring union officials getting the flu shot. That didn't have much impact, either, she said.</p>
<p>O'Regan said it's OPSEU's position to encourage vaccination, but also support a worker's right to say no.</p>
<p>"If they refuse, their employer also has the right to tell unvaccinated workers not to come to work. Or the hospital can find them work on a ward where there is no outbreak." Those workers who are sent home can opt to take Tamiflu and after two days -- when its effects kick in -- return to work, she said.</p>
<p>O'Regan, who sits on The Ottawa Hospital pandemic planning committee, predicts the hospital will have to "rethink" its policy of sending home unvaccinated workers if there is a major outbreak of swine flu.</p>
<p>"If everyone starts to get sick and it breaks into a pandemic situation, they are going to need as many employees as possible reporting to work," she said. "If you take away the 50 per cent of the people who aren't vaccinated, who are they going to have left?"</p>
<p>Concerns about vaccine safety among health-care workers have long stymied public health officials.</p>
<p>"We can't get good uptake among health-care professionals for the standard flu vaccine, which has a long safety record behind it," says Dr. Kumanan Wilson, Canada Research Chair in public health policy based at The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute. "In the hospital they will come around and offer you a lottery ticket and a chocolate bar if you get the flu shot, and they have the cart right there. A lot of people said no."</p>
<p>Wilson worries that hospital workers will spread the virus before they are vaccinated. "If the health-care worker is the carrier, they may have already spread it. We want them vaccinated up front prior to all of this ...."</p>
<p>He said making vaccines mandatory is controversial and unpopular.</p>
<p>In 2002, the issue of vaccination for seasonal flu became a contentious issue between the provincial government and its health-care workers. Ontario's 5,000 paramedics fought to have a mandatory flu vaccine removed from the Ambulance Act. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) launched a legal challenge on behalf of 50 paramedics who were suspended after they refused to comply with the mandatory flu shot. The clause in the Ambulance Act was eventually amended.</p>
<p>In another case, CUPE grieved on behalf of 130 members working at St. Peter's Health System, a chronic care geriatric facility in Hamilton. The union argued that the hospital did not have the legal right to suspend nine workers who refused to comply with a mandatory seasonal flu vaccine. Ontario labour board arbitrators ruled that a forced flu shot infringed on an employees' privacy rights and that the express consent of the worker is required.</p>
<p>Linda Haslam-Stroud, president of the Ontario Nurses Association, said there is some resistance to the vaccine among the 54,000 nurses she represents because they have seen some of their colleagues suffer serious side-effects.</p>
<p>"We have had nurses that have never been able to return to work due to the side-effects of taking an influenza vaccine in years past. I'm not talking about high numbers. But we, as the RNs on the front lines, are very familiar with what has happened to some of our colleagues, so there might be that hesitancy," she said. "Nurses are going to be interested in finding out a lot more detail on the side-effects and risks and benefits of (a) vaccine prior to agreeing to take it."</p>
<p>On Monday, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> announced that its pandemic vaccine induced a strong immune response after the first dose in a trial involving 130 volunteers, aged 18 to 60. When asked whether any adverse events had been reported in their pandemic vaccine trials, a spokesperson for <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> responded, "We have no information at this time regarding adverse events related to this ongoing clinical trial."</p>

<p>How long should you or your child stay at home after coming down with swine flu?</p>
<p>Quebec researchers at the American Microbiology Association conference in San Francisco yesterday unveiled results of a preliminary study looking at the contagious reach of Influenza A H1N1, the so-called swine flu virus.</p>
<p>It appears that the virus remains "live" - or transmissible - for at least eight days in up to 15 per cent of the population infected with the virus.</p>
<p>The study suggests that infected patients who return to work or school shortly after the fever breaks are not doing anyone a favour.</p>
<p>People infected with swine flu are contagious for eight days after they first show symptoms, said medical epidemiologist and study co-ordinator Gaston De Serre of the Quebec Institute of Public Health.</p>
<p>"Once your fever disappears, you are still likely to be contagious three days after."</p>
<p>Researchers took mouth and nose swabs from 65 families from May to July to see whether patients with H1N1 infections harbour the virus a week after symptoms strike.</p>
<p>"We're not saying people should stay home for 10 days," De Serre said. "But some people go back to work after two days. That's premature."</p>
<p>The study was headed by a dozen researchers from several Quebec university research centres and presented at the annual Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Results are to be added to data from blood samples and other studies on immune response of people who are infected but have no symptoms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Quebec doctors are negotiating with the provincial Health Department for compensation (including a bonus for being in the frontlines of a pandemic) and insurance coverage for medical services provided.</p>
<p>Doctors who will have to cover overhead office fees are seeking between $259 an hour for day works and up to $503 an hour for weekend nights.</p>
<p>"The money is one detail among many," said Jean-Pierre Dion of the Quebec Federation of General Practitioners.</p>
<p>In case of a severe outbreak of H1N1 this fall, family doctors will be recruited to sick bays, but they are not insured to work in hospitals or make-shift triage tents, Dion said.</p>
<p>Physicians are seeking rapid access to protective measures for those on the frontlines of the epidemic - vaccines, antibiotics, masks, and gloves, Dion said.</p>
<p>Specialists and family doctors have already met with the provincial Health Department twice to discuss the matter and have scheduled a meeting for next month.</p>
<p>Health Department spokesperson Dominique Breton would not provide details about the financial negotiations with the doctors.</p>
<p>"We are taking the necessary measures to assure medical care of the highest quality and the type of the insurance required," Breton said.</p>
<p>The Health Department is expected to announce next week that it will start the vaccination program in November.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hug me; Teens' lives are a massive group hug but some adults worry about the trend</b>
</div><div>Francine Kopun  </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>895 words</div><div>16 September 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>G09</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>Hugging is the new hello, if you're a teenager. It's also goodbye, nice to see you, good job, let's chat and, even, hey, it's recess.</p>
<p>"When you become a teenager, you just hug everyone," says Casey Malvern, 13, a student at Lakeside Public School in Ajax.</p>
<p>Girls hug each other and they hug boys. The boys hug girls. Some guys say they hug their guy friends -- but not at Upper Canada College, a private day and boarding school for boys.</p>
<p>"I hug girls but I don't hug guys -- maybe a man-pat," says Ben Fickling, 14, a student at UCC. To demonstrate, he grabs his friend's right hand and shakes it and they bump their right shoulders together.</p>
<p>The most popular hug is the side-squeeze: Teenagers stand beside each other; they extend their arms to the side and move in for a cheek-to-cheek hug. This may sometimes be accompanied by squealing.</p>
<p>"It's like saying, 'Hi,'" says Sara Jasion, 13, of All Saints Catholic School in Mississauga.</p>
<p>The surprise hug, usually from behind, is designed to generate screams. Then there's the boyfriend-girlfriend hug, which, all agree, is different because it lasts longer and can involve kissing.</p>
<p>There even appear to be regional differences. According to Mackenzie Pazos and her friends at Joan of Arc High School in Barrie, guys are supposed to put their arms around a girl's waist to hug them and girls are supposed to put their arms around a guy's neck.</p>
<p>Hugging has become such a concern at some U.S. schools that it has been banned amid fears of allegations of harassment or improper touching.</p>
<p>In Edmonton, one school district is discouraging students from hugging in an effort to stop the spread of the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Even without a ban, teachers are keeping a wary eye and a quiver of jokes to pry students apart.</p>
<p>"I would like daylight between you! A ribbon of daylight would be nice," Kate Dickson, English teacher and vice-principal of student services and admissions, tells her students at SOLA, the School of Liberal Arts. There are 95 students at the Toronto school in Grades 9 to 12.</p>
<p>Dickson says the trend has been building.</p>
<p>"Kids are feeling they have to hug. It has become the new social imperative. I'm becoming wary of it."</p>
<p>Dickson says students who are shy or retiring or simply aren't comfortable with that kind of close physical contact can get left out of the loop.</p>
<p>"It hasn't changed, this requirement to be popular in high school. There was always a group of people who wanted to have that squealing, screaming thing in the hall to draw attention to themselves.</p>
<p>"People shouldn't have to touch one another if they don't feel like it."</p>
<p>Dickson and others attribute the trend in part to the fact that teenagers are becoming more comfortable with their bodies and express themselves with an ease and openness unfamiliar to most North American adults. Most of it is innocent, they agree.</p>
<p>Teenagers being teenagers, of course, not all of it is.</p>
<p>There is a larger concern about immodesty. Dickson has had to send young teenage girls with plunging necklines and low-waisted pants home to "get dressed."</p>
<p>She sees a desensitization happening.</p>
<p>"Young fellows in the class, on one hand, are almost getting immune to it. I notice they don't do a lot of looking because it's becoming so common now."</p>
<p>Spectator columnist Gary Direnfeld, a social worker and family therapist, sees the phenomenon as a backlash against the proliferation of "no-touch" policies in the wake of horrifying revelations of child sexual abuse in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Schools, churches and groups for youth, such as Scouts Canada, issued detailed guidelines governing physical contact between adults and their young charges.</p>
<p>"A handshake is generally acceptable; a hug is sometimes acceptable; and an embrace is usually unacceptable," according to the Scouts Canada code of conduct.</p>
<p>Teachers complain that they can't even hug young children when they cry.</p>
<p>Direnfeld thinks the hugging between teenagers may have sprung up in reaction to that. He says it's not inherently inappropriate.</p>
<p>"Teenagers will naturally be exploring their social relationships. This is part of the adolescent norm to be touching each other," says Direnfeld. "But, sometimes, we as adults worry ourselves that where there's smoke, there's fire. It's silly on our part.</p>
<p>"You can certainly help kids to distinguish what's a reasonable greeting hug versus being sexually inappropriate in public, and even kids understand that difference."</p>
<p>Besides, the physical distance we like to keep between ourselves is a North American phenomenon.</p>
<p>"In North America, we tend to have that 12 inches of space -- you invade those 12 inches and people are going to step back," says Dickson.</p>
<p>Not in other cultures. "In European culture, it's nothing new," Direnfeld says. "Everyone hugs everyone. Two Italians meet and it's a kiss on each cheek. That's the norm."</p>

</p>
<p>Q: How do I know if it's the novel H1N1 strain?</p>
<p>A: Unless your doctor orders a test, you won't. That test, which involves a swab of nasal secretions, isn't routinely conducted. Most likely, if your doctor thinks you have the flu, you will be sent home with advice on care.</p>
<p>In some cases, however, doctors will want a more precise diagnosis, which helps inform public health officials about outbreaks. A flu test is also sometimes given to people at risk of becoming very sick, such as hospitalized patients, health-care workers, infants and those with underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>In general, it's not necessary for you to know whether your flu is H1N1 or a seasonal strain. They are treated similarly and have similar effects, but this H1N1 strain seems to be transmitted especially easily among children and young adults.</p>
<p>Q: How should I take care of myself?</p>
<p>A: Stay home and rest. You don't want to tax your body when it needs its strength to fight a virus.</p>
<p>Drink plenty of liquids to avoid dehydration.</p>
<p>Don't drink alcohol, because it can increase the risk of dehydration and it weakens the immune system's response.</p>
<p>Don't smoke; that can worsen respiratory symptoms.</p>
<p>Do take over-the-counter pain relievers (but don't give Aspirin to children or teens) for head and muscle aches.</p>
<p>To avoid infecting others, stay in a separate room in the home and try to use a separate bathroom. Wear a mask, if tolerable, when around other people, even loved ones.</p>
<p>Q: When should I go to the doctor?</p>
<p>A: In most cases a trip to the doctor isn't necessary because healthy people will recover on their own in about five days. But if you have just become ill, you may want to call the doctor to obtain a prescription for an antiviral medication.</p>
<p>Taking an antiviral, such as Tamiflu or Relenza, can shorten the course of the illness by a day or two if the medication is given within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>Doctors vary in their willingness to prescribe antiviral medications.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently advised doctors to prescribe antiviral drugs only in certain cases -- to treat or prevent illness in people who are severely ill or hospitalized or at higher risk of having serious complications from flu, such as babies and those with underlying illnesses.</p>
<p>Antivirals are not recommended for prevention or treatment in otherwise healthy people.</p>
<p>Consider seeing your doctor if you are at high risk for complications, such as developing pneumonia, sepsis or having a severe asthma attack. This includes people age 65 or older, those with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women and young children.</p>
<p>Q: Should an ill person go to the hospital?</p>
<p>A: Normally, no. But the virus can lead to other illnesses, such as bronchitis, pneumonia, sepsis or asthma flare-ups. Here are some emergency signs in children:</p>
<p>* Fast or laboured breathing, indicating pneumonia or sepsis.</p>
<p>* Bluish skin colour, indicating the child may not be getting enough oxygen.</p>
<p>* Not drinking enough fluids, which puts the child at risk for dehydration.</p>
<p>* Not waking up or interacting, which can indicate a more severe case.</p>
<p>* Being so irritable that they don't want to be held, which also can indicate more severe illness.</p>
<p>* A return of flu symptoms after the child appeared to be getting better, which could indicate that the child developed a secondary illness or was misdiagnosed with flu.</p>
<p>* Fever with a rash, which can indicate an illness other than flu.</p>
<p>In adults:</p>
<p>* Difficult breathing or shortness of breath, which could indicate pneumonia or sepsis.</p>
<p>* Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen, which could indicate a more serious case or that flu is not the right diagnosis.</p>
<p>* Sudden dizziness, which can mean the person is not getting enough oxygen.</p>
<p>* Confusion, which can mean the person isn't getting enough oxygen.</p>
<p>* Severe or persistent vomiting, which can lead to dehydration.</p>
<p>Q: How long should I stay home?</p>
<p>A: Your primary goal should be to avoid infecting others. Always stay home if you have a fever or think you may be coming down with the flu.</p>
<p>Adults can spread the flu to others for up to five days after getting sick, so stay home until you feel better and for 24 hours after the fever is gone (without use of fever-lowering medications).</p>
<p>You may have lingering symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough or fatigue. That is normal. But if your cough or congestion or any symptom hasn't abated much from its peak, you could still be infectious.</p>
<p>Sources: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Dr. Aaron Getty, spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America; Los Angeles County Department of Health Services</p>
<p>THE FACTS</p>
<p>* The novel H1N1 flu virus, commonly called swine flu, appears to be no more dangerous than many seasonal flu strains -- but it spreads more easily than many viruses.</p>
<p>* To prevent infection: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds (about the amount of time it takes to sing "Happy Birthday" twice). Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth. And avoid close contact with people who have the virus.</p>
<p>* To prevent transmission: Cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing, preferably with a tissue. No tissue? Do the "Dracula sneeze" -- into the crook of the elbow. And avoid close contact with healthy people.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>McGuinty's 'three-peat' threatened</b>
</div><div>Jim Coyle  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>

</p>
<p>QUEEN'S PARK</p>
<p>Defending a championship, the conventional wisdom goes, is a lot harder than winning one in the first place. Once on top, there are no easy days. So a "three-peat," in any competitive endeavour, is a monumental accomplishment.</p>
<p>You might say Premier Dalton McGuinty's bid for his third straight majority, and a place in provincial history books, begins in earnest this week. Chances are most political bookies are giving slightly longer odds now against his winning again in 2011 than they were even six months ago.</p>
<p>With the Legislature back in session, the Opposition leadership McGuinty will face next time out is finally in place, and the attack is certain to escalate on a government that hasn't shaken the dogs of controversy all summer.</p>
<p>This week, in his first question periods as leader, it's showtime for new Progressive Conservative boss Tim Hudak -- who's seen recent days serve up lots for him to work with.</p>
<p>Hudak obviously intends to try connecting the dots between the tax hit of the government's proposed harmonized sales tax, to kick in next July, and the spending scandals at eHealth Ontario and the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp.</p>
<p>How nervous the McGuinty government was about the potential public anger in that was illustrated by the hasty recent cleanout at OLG -- a pre-emptive head-rolling designed to mute the issue before the Legislature spotlight resumed.</p>
<p>Hudak intends to hit hard at a government "that's become far too fat and comfortable after six years in office."</p>
<p>NDP leader Andrea Horwath, now six months on the job, stressed similar themes. The McGuinty government, she said, has grown "increasingly arrogant and distant." The eHealth and OLG scandals saw the squandering of scarce resources -- while hospitals close and special ed is cut -- "on perks for well-connected insiders."</p>
<p>Hudak will likely draw as much scrutiny as the government, with observers looking to see if he's a credible premier-in-waiting or has more going for him than the amiable manner of a small-town real estate agent.</p>
<p>Come tomorrow, all eyes will be on the byelection in Toronto's St. Paul's riding, which holds symbolic value for all parties beyond a mere one seat. Both Hudak and Horwath have tried to turn the byelection into a referendum on the HST, road-testing the issue for 2011.</p>
<p>For McGuinty, tax reform -- the competitive advantage it promises, the courage it takes to pursue -- is the mast to which he's nailed his colours.</p>
<p>The challenge, he says, is to do "everything we can to strengthen this economy and create jobs," because while the recession is easing, recovery will be slow and grudging.</p>
<p>That's another reason he's so keen that November bring a victory for Toronto in its bid for the 2015 Pan Am Games and a bit of good news for him to brighten a period in which there hasn't been much.</p>
<p>To get to a third electoral victory, McGuinty will need to navigate some tough seas.</p>
<p>There's already suspicion his government's deficit will be larger than the $18.5 billion forecast. Last week, McGuinty signalled concern the federal government might fight its own soaring deficit "on the backs of the provinces" as was done in the 1990s.</p>
<p>All around him are storm cells -- a boycott by defence lawyers of the Legal Aid program, worries about how committed he is to full-day kindergarten, the H1N1 threat.</p>
<p>On top of that, there's the likelihood that Deputy Premier George Smitherman will leave to seek the Toronto mayor's job and that other MPPs will opt for federal and municipal runs.</p>
<p>Hudak and Horwath haven't yet mused on the connection between rats and sinking ships.</p>
<p>But the week is young.</p>

<p>EDMONTON</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services is reporting Canada's second drug-resistant case of pandemic swine flu -- one of about two dozen such cases worldwide.</p>
<p>Officials were busy yesterday trying to determine if anyone who came into contact with the Alberta woman last month has been infected, but they were optimistic that this was an isolated case.</p>
<p>"The patient was not hospitalized and has since recovered," said Dr. Gerry Predy, Alberta's senior medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Health officials say any resistance to oseltamivir, also known as Tamiflu, could possibly lead to further cases of resistant disease and might affect how the disease spreads.</p>
<p>Information about the Alberta case has been forwarded to Ottawa and the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Officials were not sure if she developed an infection with the resistant strain from the outset or developed the resistance during treatment.</p>
<p>About 24 cases of drug-resistant swine flu have been reported worldwide, including an earlier case involving a 60-year-old man from Quebec who was given the drug when he was exposed to swine flu because his son was ill. He recovered and didn't appear to spread resistant virus to people around home.</p>
<p>Other resistant cases have been reported in the United States, Denmark, Australia, China and Singapore.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>More bed closures pending; Edmonton, Calgary expected to lose 350 in next three years, health union presidents say</b>
</div><div>Jodie Sinnema And Sheila Pratt   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>849 words</div><div>16 September 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Edmonton and Calgary are expected to lose 350 acute-care hospital beds over the next three years, in addition to 150 already slated to be closed at Alberta Hospital, in an effort to cut costs and move seniors into their communities, say the presidents of two Alberta health unions.</p>
<p>The 350 bed closures will happen as patients, currently blocking hospital beds because there is no space for them elsewhere, are moved out into 800 new community living options, which could include home-care, assisted living or help for families, said Heather Smith, president of the United Nurses of Alberta, which represents 24,000 registered nurses. The empty beds they leave behind will not be staffed but will be saved for emergency cases, such as an H1N1 pandemic, she said.</p>
<p>"People should be asking for some real transparency and some real answers in terms of how do you actually deliver increased access and quality when you are further shrinking a system that already can't meet the acute-care needs," said Smith.</p>
<p>The UNA president was told about the plans by Alberta Health Services on Tuesday in advance of a public announcement expected today.</p>
<p>"It exacerbates the current pressures we have with not enough timely access and long wait times. The people (receiving care) in the hallways will still be in the hallways. In fact, I suggest there will be even more."</p>
<p>Elisabeth Ballermann, president of the Health Sciences Association of Alberta, said the move will download demands onto the shoulders of families and neighbours, since there currently aren't enough home care resources.</p>
<p>"I am a long ways from convinced that we are actually going to enhance community services sufficiently," said Ballermann, who represents 18,000 lab technologists, mental health nurses and professionals in many other disciplines.</p>
<p>"I would like to be proven wrong, but this has been happening a long time....The people who are working in the system have been dealing with so much uncertainty and chaos over the last little bit that, quite frankly, it's gotten to where its abusive towards them."</p>
<p>Alberta's health superboard is expected to release more details today, including the move of 150 mental health patients out of beds slated for closure at Alberta Hospital into 150 new beds in the Ottewell Senior Citizen's Lodge and Villa Caritas near the Misericordia Hospital, sources say.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services CEO Stephen Duckett declined to provide specifics Tuesday, but said, "I've always said no one will be moved unless there is somewhere for them to go." He said most of the 150 Alberta Hospital patients continue to need sheltered care, but the model of an institution on the city outskirts is no longer appropriate. He toured some community facilities with area psychiatrists to find other, more suitable beds.</p>
<p>"We're putting some finishing touches on the plan," he said, noting that some acute care beds will remain open at Alberta Hospital Edmonton for people needing emergency and chronic mental-health care.</p>
<p>But the bed reduction at Alberta Hospital is "the right thing to do," said Duckett, who knew the hospital was too old for renovations as soon as he toured it.</p>
<p>The beds at Villa Caritas, which are still under construction behind the Misericordia Hospital, will be a mix of acute-care, assisted living and nursing home beds.</p>
<p>The building was originally intended to house seniors currently in the Edmonton General Hospital. Those seniors will remain at that hospital while the mental health patients move in over the next year or two.</p>
<p>Duckett didn't speak about the broader bed closure, but sources say approximately 200 out of the 350 expected beds are in the Edmonton area.</p>
<p>Duckett has consistently emphasized the need to move patients no longer needing hospital care out of hospital beds. In his recent blog on the subject, Duckett expressed his wish to keep hospital beds open and layoffs minimal.</p>
<p>"What I've committed to is improvement in access, so whatever we do on budgets, I have said our priority is to protect patient care," said Duckett, whose annual bonus is based in part on achieving certain wait-time targets.</p>
<p>"At the end of the day, the thing the public worry most about is access."</p>
<p>Kevin Taft, Liberal MLA for Edmonton-Riverview, was dubious in light of the imminent bed closures.</p>
<p>"If Stephen Duckett and (Health Minister) Ron Liepert are honest about this, this is about saving money at the expense of quality patient care," Taft said.</p>
<p>"I think it's the wrong move. I think expanding resources in the community is great, but Edmonton and Calgary have long had the most crowded hospitals in Canada and this is just going to make it worse. It's not like there are empty hospital beds sitting around by the hundreds anywhere in Alberta."</p>
<p>He said he wonders how many beds will be closed in rural areas.</p>

<p>As we get settled in the back-to-school routine, we are going to be warned once again about a potential H1N1 flu pandemic. And we will be reminded again of the effectiveness of basic hygiene and hand washing.</p>
<p>In the developing world, pneumonia and diarrhea take the lives of 3.5 million children every year. And, yes, basic hygiene and hand washing are, according to UNICEF, "among the most effective ways to prevent" such deaths.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>School caretakers will pay less attention to housekeeping and be more vigilant about cleaning high touch surfaces like door knobs and desk tops this year as the Upper Grand District School Board braces for what could be a nasty flu season.</p>
<p>School boards across the country have guidelines from the Ministry of Health for hand hygiene, coughing and sneezing etiquette, and increased cleaning. It also recommends keeping kids home from school when they are sick.</p>
<p>"The Minister wants a consistent approach across the province," Martha Rogers, director of education, told the Upper Grand's program committee Tuesday night as she spelled out the board's plan for H1N1.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health is not recommending school closures, but schools will report absenteeism to local public health when numbers become high enough.</p>
<p>"We would not consider school closures unless there was so many staff away and we could not fill their places with occasional teachers," Rogers said. "Then it's really a safety issue and not a public health issue."</p>
<p>H1N1 isn't usually fatal, although there have been enough deaths worldwide for public institutions to develop safety plans.</p>
<p>Symptoms include high fever, cough, muscle aches. This strain seems to affect children and young people more than adults.</p>
<p>Paul Scinocca, manager of capital projects and renewal, said head custodians are changing work schedules for extra cleaning.</p>
<p>He said afternoon staff may be pulled into daytime shifts to clean inside classrooms twice a day while students are outside at recess, and cleaning halls and washrooms when students are in class.</p>
<p>Special attention will be paid to kindergarten classrooms.</p>
<p>Other duties, like sweeping and mopping floors, will be done less frequently Scinocca said.</p>
<p>Maggie McFadzen, the board's spokesperson, said if cases to occur in Guelph schools this winter, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health will not name students or teachers that have it or which school they attend.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A tale of two moles; Complex sauces fuse pre-Hispanic and European ingredients into signature dishes</b>
</div><div>Jennifer Bain   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>760 words</div><div>16 September 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>E01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Oaxacan chef Pilar Cabrera has arrived in Toronto on a culinary mission to persuade Canadians to think about Mexico with their stomachs.</p>
<p>She has brought an arsenal of dried chilies and other ingredients to cook some of the seven famous moles of Oaxaca at local restaurant and cooking school events.</p>
<p>Cabrera, who runs La Olla restaurant and La Casa de Los Sabores bed-and-breakfast and cooking school, says tourism has been plummeting since mid-2006. First a nasty civil strike prompted travel advisories. Then drug wars and killings, in other parts of Mexico, captured headlines. Just as tourism was starting to pick up came the economic crisis and the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Now Cabrera is devoting September - always a slow month - to her first Canadian trip.On Friday, Cabrera came to the Star's test kitchen to tell a tale of two moles. Moles (pronounced MO-lays) are complex sauces simmered with meat and vegetables. A fusion of pre-Hispanic and European ingredients, they're the signature dish of Oaxaca (pronounced wah-HACK-a), one of Mexico's 31 states and the southern city that Cabrera calls home.</p>
<p>First we cook Mole Amarillo, a rich, not too spicy, yellow mole that gets its subtle heat and depth from dried amarillo and guajillo chilies. A simple dish that is routinely made at home, it's popular at Cabrera's restaurant and cooking school. I wonder if, like the Rolling Stones being asked to play "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" yet again, Cabrera gets weary of making it.</p>
<p>"No! No! No!" she replies, incredulous. "At the beginning (of cooking) you don't have anything. At the end you have a delicious mole."</p>
<p>"And then you get your satisfaction," chimes in Mary Luz Mejia, the Toronto food writer/TV producer who helped coordinate Cabrera's trip.</p>
<p>For our Mole Amarillo, we mix the luscious sauce with chicken thighs, potato chunks, green beans and thick chayote slices. I've bought all the Mexican ingredients from Perola, a Latin American grocery store in Kensington Market</p>
<p>Next up is Mole Verde (a green sauce) and Cabrera is excited. She didn't think Toronto would have enough key ingredients, but I have found tomatillos, a fresh herb called epazote, and a dried heart-shaped leaf called hoja santa. This light, fresh mole (also served with chicken thighs, green beans and chayote) comes together more quickly than the Mole Amarillo.</p>
<p>Both moles use freshly roasted cumin seeds. "My grandmum said cumin is good for the stomach," says Cabrera, "and each mole has cumin in the recipe."</p>
<p>Cabrera is a patient cook and teacher. It's easy to see why Chicago chef Rick Bayless, renowned for popularizing regional Mexican cooking, sings her praises. Their relationship dates back a decade, and he routinely brings his staff and culinary trips to her cooking school.</p>
<p>We don't have time for Mole Negro, the well-known black mole made from 30 or more ingredients, including chocolate.</p>
<p>Other moles are rojo (red), coloradito (a lighter red, used for enchiladas), chi chilo (made from black chilies, roasted tortillas and roasted avocado leaves) and mancha manteles (literally "stain the tablecloth").</p>
<p>Cabrera starts her guest chef gigs this week. Look for her at Frida Restaurant & Bar, Frank at the AGO, Veritas Local Fare,Torito Tapas Bar and the Chef's House at George Brown College. She'll also teach at Nella Cucina Cooking School.</p>
<p>The Mexican chef has already joined an Iron Chef competition at Harbourfront's Hot & Spicy Food Festival and helped judge an emerging chef competition - an event she'd love to see duplicated in Oaxaca where "great young chefs need inspiration."</p>
<p>In between all this cooking, Cabrera will get a taste of multicultural Toronto. She has eaten in Greektown and Yorkville, and tried Szechuan and Thai food. Next up: Ethiopian and maybe Korean.</p>
<p>She has come here with Alvin Starkman, a family law litigator from Toronto who retired to Oaxaca almost five years ago and now writes food articles and runs a bed-and-breakfast with his wife.</p>
<p>Starkman's message to Toronto: "In terms of food, Canadians tend to think Mexican food is tacos and enchiladas. I can only speak for the state of Oaxaca, but it's a lot more than tacos and enchiladas."</p>

</div><div>Carol Sanders    </div>

<p>The H1N1 virus is expected to surge when the fall flu season begins, hitting younger victims harder than regular flu. It has already taken several Manitobans' lives.</p>
<p>But it's spared many more, including one very sick but strong toddler whose photo appeared in the Free Press on June 28.</p>
<p>After being turned away from the emergency ward three times in the late spring, Rhea Myers ended up in the pediatric intensive care unit at the Health Sciences Centre in June.</p>
<p>She was placed in a sterile isolation room, hooked up to a breathing machine and in a coma for weeks. At that traumatic time, her parents agreed to an interview and to have her photo taken, but didn't want their names made public.</p>
<p>Today, the toddler with long blond curls is back in the pink, at home with her family and enjoying the swing sets of Stonewall.</p>
<p>"She's doing fabulous," said her dad, Scott Myers.</p>
<p>He and Rhea's mom, Michelle, are so grateful that their H1N1 story had a happy ending, they agreed to share it.</p>
<p>"If there is a silver lining to a child being that sick, perhaps being in the coma gave her body the rest it needed to heal and she has somehow beaten H1N1 and is now healthier than ever."</p>
<p>In June, Rhea was one of 20 suspected or confirmed H1N1 cases in the pediatric ICU.</p>
<p>Like all of those kids hit hardest by H1N1, Rhea had medical challenges. The 16-month-old already had respiratory problems and needed supplemental oxygen to help her breathe. Still, she was a busy, happy toddler. When she became totally listless, her parents became alarmed.</p>
<p>After she was admitted to hospital, she tested positive for the H1N1 virus that was virtually shutting down her lungs.</p>
<p>A ventilator pumped 300 shallow breaths a minute into her lungs. The quick, little breaths pumped in oxygen without inflating -- and further damaging -- her injured little lungs, giving them time to heal.</p>
<p>"Lungs can make a remarkable recovery," a pediatric ICU doctor said at the time.</p>
<p>Rhea's did.</p>
<p>"After over a year of requiring oxygen on a daily basis, she hasn't needed any for over a month," Michelle said.</p>
<p>"It's so great to go to the park or even just to our backyard without carrying an oxygen tank with us or worry that her oxygen levels are dropping too low."</p>
<p>Today, Rhea's parents want others to know there is hope when it comes to the dreaded virus and to express their thanks for the help and support they've received.</p>
<p>"People are so important -- friends, family and community," Michelle said.</p>
<p>Scott's sister, Carolyn Fines in Stonewall, looked after Rhea's three-year-old brother, Alex, when they visited Rhea in the hospital. Fines was glad to help.</p>
<p>"It's hard to watch when there's not much you can do," said Fines, whose daughters Madison, 6, and Sarah, 9, also wanted to help their cousin. They and their friends donated money from a lemonade stand to the Children's Hospital Foundation.</p>
<p>At the pediatric ICU, Rhea's parents met parents and grandparents from as far away as Churchill keeping watch over the tiny patients through the windows of their isolation rooms. There were days when the other parents' watch tragically ended.</p>
<p>"It's sad," Michelle said. "You see them every day for a month" and a quiet bond of understanding develops. "They totally get it," she said.</p>
<p>Rhea's parents were at home when the pediatric ICU called with the good news she was awake.</p>
<p>"We cried," said Michelle.</p>
<p>Rhea takes a protective antibiotic, and now needs to be a little stronger before she's able to go to daycare, said Michelle. The little girl, who's always had a happy nature, is glad to be home and so is her big brother, Alex, who missed her. When Rhea was able to breathe without oxygen tubes, he was overjoyed," she said.</p>
<p>"Alex jumped up with his arms in the air yelling 'no more tubes, hurray for Rhea!'"</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ex-prof urges hand sanitizer for cashiers -</b>

<p>FIRST it was a stop sign, but now a former University of Manitoba assistant professor wants to stop the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>Rod Yellon, a political studies professor for 37 years before retiring, has asked Sobeys, <span class="companylink">Safeway</span> and Superstore to give all cashiers hand sanitizer bottles at cash registers.</p>
<p>Yellon, who made headlines in 2002 -- and a mention by Jay Leno on The Tonight Show -- for unsuccessfully challenging the constitutionality of the word "Stop" on the traffic sign, said it would be one way to prevent the virus from spreading.</p>
<p>"Cashiers at checkout stands touch every item that is purchased," Yellon said.</p>
<p>"A cashier with a virus therefore has the potential to infect every customer he or she checks out... an infected cashier could, in the course of a single eight-hour shift, unintentionally transmit the virus to 100 or more customers."</p>
<p>Yellon said to prevent this, the grocery store chains should give the cashiers hand sanitizer and teach them to use it after they sneeze or cough.</p>
<p>He said he hasn't received any response from the grocery chains.</p>
<p>Dr. Sande Haroos, a provincial medical officer of health, said she wouldn't recommend exactly what type of action businesses should take against H1N1, but she said employers should provide a way for employees to wash their hands.</p>
<p>Haroos said there are other measures employees can take.</p>
<p>"We need to remind everybody they should stay home when they're sick," she said.</p>
<p>"We do need to remember to cough or sneeze into a tissue or an elbow or sleeve. And if you sneeze into a hand, you should have access to washing your hand."</p>
<p>Haroos said the virus doesn't survive on skin that long, but it can last up to seven hours on other surfaces.</p>

<p>How long should you or your child stay at home after coming down with swine flu?</p>
<p>Quebec researchers attending the American Microbiology Association conference in San Francisco Tuesday unveiled results of a preliminary study looking at the contagious reach of influenza H1N1. "Once your fever disappears, you are still likely to be contagious three days after," said medical epidemiologist and study co-ordinator Gaston De Serre of the Quebec Institute of Public Health.</p>

<p>Alberta has recorded its first drug-resistant case of the H1N1 virus, an event the province's senior medical officer of health called "significant."</p>
<p>"Any resistance to medication is important because it could possibly lead to further cases of resistant disease and potentially impact how a disease spreads," said Dr. Gerry Predy.</p>
<p>The patient did not have to be hospitalized but was being treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir for H1N1 when the resistance to the medication was identified.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic school board will reverse an earlier policy and allow alcohol-based hand cleaning products in its schools to help combat the H1N1 flu this school year, trustees decided Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Windsor Essex Catholic District School Board had previously eliminated the use of the products but the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term care recently issued provincial boards with its guidelines on preventing and managing the pandemic in all elementary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>The ministry recommended that "hand rub alcohol should be placed in locations under adult supervision."</p>
<p>The ministry noted that the Ontario Fire Marshal's office had recently concluded that the alcohol-based cleaners posed a minimal fire threat.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>City plan envisions thousands off with flu - Police probes, fire education could be delayed</b>

<p>City emergency-preparedness officials are still planning for a worst-case H1N1 scenario this fall even though they no longer expect the outbreak to be as virulent as originally predicted.</p>
<p>The city has a plan to deal with an H1N1 outbreak that infects 30 per cent of its 8,200-person workforce, even though health authorities believe it is more likely that 10 to 20 per cent of city staff will be infected, emergency preparedness co-ordinator Randy Hull told city councillors at a Monday morning briefing.</p>
<p>"We're still very concerned, but we're not panicked," said Hull, who has been working on a pandemic plan since 2007, long before the H1N1 threat emerged.</p>
<p>The city's H1N1 plan will see workers moved around within city departments to cover off essential city services during the expected pandemic. For example, some police investigations could be put on hold to ensure patrol cars are fully staffed and fire-safety education could be placed on hiatus to ensure fire halls have full complements, Hull said.</p>
<p>There are no plans to close city facilities or reduce city services, but hard surfaces in city buildings will be cleaned more often and people who feel sick will be asked to keep their distance from each other during face-to-face meetings, Hull said.</p>
<p>For now, however, the city is not discouraging people from seeking face-to-face contact with city officials. The province would have to order up such a move, Hull said.</p>
<p>Even though international authorities are only calling for a 10 to 20 per cent H1N1 infection rate, "double that percentage" of Winnipeg's workforce might have to stay home because some will need to care for ill relatives, Hull said.</p>
<p>Hull said it is impossible to predict the severity of this fall's expected H1N1 season, when it will begin and when it will peak. But he did say he does not expect everyone who falls ill to get sick simultaneously.</p>
<p>If H1N1 begins to impact city services, a section of the 311 information system will be carved off to deal with flu questions and concerns, much as a flood line was set up during this past spring, Hull said.</p>
<p>No to low-income bus passes</p>
<p>A plan to create a specially priced bus pass for people on low income is poised to be rejected by city councillors.</p>
<p>The last time bus fares were raised, Winnipeg Transit was asked to study the idea of special low-income fares.</p>
<p>A report due before city council's public works committee this morning suggests low-income fares should be introduced because they would duplicate the aim of a provincial program that provides transportation funds to people with limited incomes.</p>
<p>But the same report says Winnipeg Transit should consider introducing reduced fares for rides at off-peak hours. That move could be made once city buses are finally equipped with new electronic fare terminals, an upgrade originally announced early this decade.</p>
<p>Last meow for animal boss</p>
<p>THE city official in charge of cats and dogs is preparing to retire from the city following a 26-year career.</p>
<p>Tim Dack, chief operating officer of the Animal Services Special Operating Agency, has notified the city he will retire on Nov. 6.</p>
<p>Dack, who started working for the city in 1973, has run animal services since 1994.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Single dose of flu vaccine brings immunity</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>442 words</div><div>15 September 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>B8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>
</p>
<p>A single dose of the human swine flu vaccine set for Canada provides nearly 100 per cent immunity from H1N1 three weeks after vaccination, according to early results from the first clinical trial of the pandemic vaccine.</p>
<p>Some experts have worried that two doses, given three weeks apart, would be needed to get adequate immunity. If the results hold out, Canada will have more vaccine than it needs.</p>
<p>Logistically, it would mean people would not have to line up for multiple shots, increasing the chances of getting a higher percentage of the population vaccinated and, in turn, getting population-wide immunity up faster.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> announced Monday that its pandemic vaccine induced a strong immune response after the first dose in a trial involving 130 healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 60.</p>
<p>Two vaccines were tested: An adjuvanted and unadjuvanted one. Adjuvants are compounds added to vaccines to boost the body's immune response to the vaccine. Adding an adjuvant allows companies to use less antigen -- the part of the virus that the immune system recognizes and to which it makes antibodies.</p>
<p>According to <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, a single dose of the adjuvanted vaccine generated immunity in 98 per cent of those vaccinated after three weeks.</p>
<p>In the unadjuvanted group, 95 per cent reached the same "threshold," but the adjuvanted shots contained one-quarter the antigen dose. The less antigen needed per dose to get an immune response, the more doses that can be made available in a short time.</p>
<p>"All of this helps you get more, earlier," says Earl Brown, executive director of the Emerging Pathogens Research Centre at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>That could be crucial. U.S. scientists warned last week that H1N1 vaccines will arrive too late to hold back a second wave of illness. The pandemic is most likely to follow the pattern of the Asian flu of 1957-58, they said -- substantial spread beginning any day now, and peaking in mid- to late-October.</p>
<p>Canada has ordered 50.4 million vaccine doses from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>. That was based on the assumption that two doses would be needed, and that 60 per cent of the population would want it or need it.</p>
<p>Although it is only the first round of testing, the initial results "look very promising," Dr. John Spika, director general of the centre for immunization and respiratory infectious diseases at the Public Health Agency of Canada, told Canwest News Service Monday evening.</p>
<p>"We're going to have more than enough vaccine . . . We've got more than enough for any Canadian that wants to receive it," he said.</p>
