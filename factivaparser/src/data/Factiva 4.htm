<div id="hd"><b>Schools still posting kids' absentee rates - Third wave of H1N1 may hit, says MD</b>
</div><div>By Nick Martin    </div>
<div>492 words</div><div>24 April 2010</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>When's the last time you checked on the absentee rate at your child's school?</p>
<p>You still can.</p>
<p>The fears over an imminent H1N1 outbreak are long gone, but every school division in Manitoba is still reporting school-by-school absence rates on its website.</p>
<p>Both the Health and Education departments say the decision was made because of a fear of a third wave of flu which has yet to materialize.</p>
<p>"Schoolchildren are often the first age group to become ill and to spread the infection," said Dr. Joel Kettner, the province's chief public health officer. "We're very interested in having that continue for the rest of the year."</p>
<p>A provincial education official said the system will be reviewed this summer.</p>
<p>Kettner cautioned that the province is not using the school absenteeism reports as an early-warning system -- schools have always been expected to call their public health nurse and the regional health authority if there's an unusual level of student absenteeism, and that hasn't changed.</p>
<p>"The web was not meant to be the method for communicating to public health," said Kettner.</p>
<p>Posting on the web "was a mechanism to inform the public. That might influence (parent) decisions for their own children," he said.</p>
<p>Kettner said it's possible to have another wave of H1N1 from this spring to early fall, but vaccine and a buildup of immunity through exposure make a wave similar in size to the first two unlikely. "It's certainly possible there will be more cases of H1N1," he said.</p>
<p>"Since the middle of January, we've had very little confirmed or identified influenza illnesses," Kettner said.</p>
<p>School divisions say that it takes very little staff time to update the lists, now that the system is in place.</p>
<p>Red River Valley S.D. superintendent Kelly Barkman said from Morris that his division hasn't had a school with higher-than-normal rates of absenteeism since January.</p>
<p>"They (the Education Department) sent something out in January, and said carry on until further notice," said Barkman.</p>
<p>"It was until further notice -- we just keep it going," St. James-Assiniboia S.D. superintendent Ron Weston said.</p>
<p>Neither could say how many parents check the list each day -- their websites aren't set up to track hits to specific sections of the site.</p>
<p>Last fall, the Free Press reported that then-education minister Peter Bjornson said the province would not make public any unusual rates of absenteeism in individual schools. Later that morning, then-premier Gary Doer said on radio that, as a parent, he'd want to know, and by that afternoon, Bjornson had issued schools a directive to post absences daily on their websites.</p>
<p>The daily absence reports note that higher-than-normal levels may not necessarily be because of the flu.</p>

<p>Stay focused. Be factual. Don't panic. Respond.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq says those were the principles which formed the approach she adopted one year ago when the H1N1 flu pandemic arrived on Canada's doorstep, and followed as the crisis unfolded over the following 10 months.</p>
<p>The approach worked, she said: Canada handled the pandemic successfully and is being looked to as a model for other nations who didn't fare as well.</p>
<p>"I think we've done a fantastic job in rolling out the pandemic plan," Aglukkaq said in an interview this past week along with chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones. The two were practically joined at the hip from the point the pandemic broke out in Canada, holding daily press conferences and working long hours to keep on top of the rapidly unfolding situation.</p>
<p>"There were really no weekends, and evenings went on until 8 or 9 every night," recalls Aglukkaq. "We had no life for 10 months."</p>
<p>By this date last April, Aglukkaq and Butler-Jones had been alerted that Mexico and the United States were grappling with respiratory illness outbreaks of some sort, and samples of the mysterious flu-like bug had been sent to Canada's national microbiology laboratory in Winnipeg for testing.</p>
<p>On April 23, scientists there announced the virus was a new strain of the "swine flu" virus. On April 26, the first Canadian cases were confirmed. The World Health Organization warned of the potential for a full-scale pandemic and it wasn't long before the H1N1 flu bug had spread to every corner of the planet.</p>
<p>The federal government kicked the national pandemic preparedness plan into action and Canadians were bombarded with stories in the media about the disease, which eventually came to be called the H1N1 flu -- partly because of an outcry from pork farmers who worried for their livelihood.</p>
<p>"I said very early on that I was going to communicate with Canadians so that Canadians make an informed decision as to what we're dealing with," said Aglukkaq, who was the health minister in Nunavut before coming to Ottawa. "I would say communication was a strong point."</p>
<p>The problem, however, was that there was too little known about H1N1. It was a brand-new version of the flu that wasn't behaving like a typical influenza virus. At the outset, health specialists were at a loss to predict how the pandemic would develop. Then when the H1N1 vaccine was on its way, there was confusion over its two different versions -- one with an adjuvant and one without for pregnant women -- when it would be available, where, and how it had been tested.</p>
<p>"We did not do a good job at communicating issues around the vaccine, on many levels. We did a good job at lots of other things," said Dr. Allison McGeer, a microbiologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto who was interviewed frequently by the media throughout the pandemic.</p>
<p>Despite the demand for instant information from the public and the media, the hard reality is that in public health emergencies there are always uncertainties, McGeer said, and that message didn't get through.</p>
<p>"I think we frankly did a terrible job of communicating that issue broadly," she said.</p>
<p>The federal pandemic effort suffered serious image problems. First Nations communities -- particularly those in remote areas of Manitoba -- were hit disproportionately hard by the bug. So when the federal government sent some of those communities shipments of flu-fighting supplies that included a consignment of body bags, it appeared to add insult to injury. Health Canada apologized for the body bag shipment last September.</p>
<p>There were widespread complaints about the time it took to roll out the vaccine.</p>
<p>With the exception of how things were handled when H1N1 hit several First Nations communities, and the failure to have the vaccine at the start of the second wave in the fall, McGeer says Canada performed "reasonably well" but she adds a caveat: "We need to be conscious of the fact that things went well in part because we were lucky," she said.</p>
<p>Canada experienced two waves of the illness and by the end of 2009, H1N1 had waned. More than 8,000 Canadians were hospitalized and close to 1,500 of them were treated in intensive care units. The latest data from the Public Health Agency of Canada indicate that 428 Canadians lost their lives.</p>
<p>In the history books however, the 2009 pandemic will be known as a mild one.</p>

<p>Jaded by an excess of tapas, martinis, sleek modern decor and servers in small black dresses, urban hipsters are looking to sate their appetites for restaurant coolness in an unlikely place -- the bathroom.</p>
<p>Yes, the new frontier for truly chic eateries is staked largely on porcelain and chrome, with understated designer furniture and lighting. If patrons are tempted to linger, chatting on their mobiles while relaxing in a Barcelona chair, so much the better.</p>
<p>Such scenes are a regular occurrence at Cactus Club at West Edmonton Mall, for example. The B.C. chain overseen by celebrity chef Rob Feenie has carved out a strange little niche for itself by building unique, buzzworthy loos.</p>
<p>"We get tons of comment cards weekly, and a lot of them say the washrooms are really cool," says assistant general manager Shawn Rennie. "That's one of the things we really pride ourselves on."</p>
<p>Illuminated graffiti art sits above leather Barcelona chairs and sofas, bookended with Lucite tables from hot local design shop Dwell. Wall tiles are made from glass and poured concrete. There are TV screens in each stall and above the men's urinals, and lighted makeup mirrors by the women's sinks.</p>
<p>The chain's design manager, Anna Walentowicz, calls these features "the X-factor" -- the details that make people return to their tables talking about the john. "We pour a lot of money into our bathrooms," she adds.</p>
<p>The trend seems to be spreading like -- heaven forbid -- soap scum. Competitors have upped the appeal of their facilities, designing bathrooms that fit with the sleek, modern furnishings of their gleaming new restaurants.</p>
<p>Just check out any of the newer eateries in South Edmonton Common, such as Joey's, Earls or Moxie's, where chic seating, fully enclosed stalls and high-end fixtures are de rigueur. Redesigns at hot spots such as Campus Earls have seen even the basement bathrooms get a chic facelift with huge, embossed black doors on each stall and crystal chandeliers for lighting.</p>
<p>As with most evolutions, it's hard to pinpoint where or when the trend started. But there's a good chance Cactus Club was at the forefront.</p>
<p>"We seem to be the pioneers in this whole bathroom environment upgrade," says Walentowicz, who has designed all 20 Cactus Club restaurants, including their unique bathrooms.</p>
<p>It all started in 2000, when Walentowicz discovered a roomy lower level in the space that was to become the Cactus Club at Ashe and Broadway in Vancouver. She decided to turn it into spectacular bathrooms. The rest is lavatory legend.</p>
<p>The move to beautify bathrooms is evident across the industry in newer, trendier restaurants, says Mark von Schellwitz, the Canadian Restaurant and Food Services Association's vice-president for Western Canada. As the industry comes out of the recession, restaurants are looking for new ways to attract customers, he adds.</p>
<p>"Paying attention to details like bathroom design is one way to stand out and enhance the overall appeal. Patrons will actually talk about a fancy bathroom and create buzz about the location."</p>
<p>Hygiene is another huge selling point for bathrooms in the age of H1N1 and super-bugs. Most well-designed restrooms now have automatic dispensers for soap, towels and water.</p>
<p>At the Cactus Club, technology makes virtually every step hands-free. At the press of a button, the plastic-covered toilet seat automatically turns, giving each user a pristine surface to sit upon. Flushing is also hands-free, by stepping on a button in the floor.</p>
<p>The room is maintained with a precision bordering on OCD.</p>
<p>Timers in each loo go off every 15 minutes, lighting a red or blue switch (for women or men) in the dishwashing area, alerting a staff member to clean it.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Why Ontario is taking on the pharmacies -</b>
</div><div>Livio Di Matteo    </div>

</p>
<p>Ontario's latest foray in health expenditure control and the targeting of drug expenditures is best understood by examining the recent evolution of health spending in the province.</p>
<p>Over the last 40 years, real per capita provincial government health spending in Ontario has grown faster than standard measures of the resource base -- an indicator that health spending is not sustainable.</p>
<p>For example, while inflation-adjusted spending per person on health in Ontario has grown at about four per cent per year, accompanying growth rates for GDP, federal transfers and provincial government revenues have grown well below that rate. This is not just an Ontario phenomenon -- this also holds for every other province.</p>
<p>Provincial government health spending in Ontario (in 2009 constant dollars) grew from $13.5 billion in 1975 to $45.2 billion by 2009 -- a more than threefold increase after inflation.</p>
<p>More importantly, as a share of provincial government program expenditures over this period, health went from 31 per cent to 46 per cent and is anticipated to account for over half of government spending in the very near future.</p>
<p>Clearly, unless health spending is reined in, there will be less money for other government programs in areas such as social spending, education, transportation and public security.</p>
<p>All this is made much more dire by the recent slowdown in the Ontario economy and the rising debt and deficit whose servicing costs will also eat into the government budget.</p>
<p>So given that health spending is on the radar screen, why is the Ontario government starting off by going after what amounts to a few hundred million dollars in savings from pharmacists?</p>
<p>The answer is best understood by realizing that while provincial government health spending faces a sustainability issue, some categories of health spending are more sustainable than others.</p>
<p>When the health expenditure categories used by the Canadian Institute for Health Information are examined for Ontario government health spending for the period 1975 to 2009, the largest average annual growth rate is for drugs at 10 per cent.</p>
<p>Next comes public health spending at about nine per cent, followed by other health (home care, ambulances, etc.) at eight per cent and then capital spending at seven per cent. Physicians are next at four per cent annual growth followed eventually by hospitals at a paltry two per cent.</p>
<p>The fastest growth in government health care spending over the last 40 years has not been in the traditional health sectors of physician and hospital spending but in these other sectors.</p>
<p>As a result, the share of government health spending in Ontario accounted for by physicians and hospitals declined from 77 per cent in 1975 to 60 per cent in 2009.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the share accounted for by all the remaining categories rose from 23 per cent to 40 per cent!</p>
<p>As for the remaining categories, it is public drug spending that has exhibited the greatest growth rate and as a result has become a target.</p>
<p>Much of this spending, however, is on drugs for seniors -- a politically vocal group. This explains why in the end the overall savings are only a few hundred million dollars despite the outrage being expressed by pharmacists who are bearing the brunt of the savings. Attempts to reach bigger savings are yet to come but political optics requires that the drug sector get a cut. The provincial government, however, is focusing on pharmacists rather than the true sources of spending -- consumer demand and drug manufacturers.</p>
<p>What will the future bring to health care in Ontario and by extension the rest of Canada's provinces? In the age of SARS and H1N1, public health will likely be a hands-off category.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that hospitals and physicians have exhibited among the lowest growth rates in spending, there will be no reward for good behaviour. Together, these categories still account for 60 per cent of government health spending and the sheer size of these sectors represent a substantial source of savings.</p>
<p>After some tinkering with home-care spending and a slowing of capital projects, expect to see a concerted effort to tackle labour-intensive physician and hospital services.</p>
<p>The proposed pay-for-performance contracts targeted at hospital CEOs in Ontario could be extended more broadly to the hospital sector as well as physicians. Moreover, a long-standing goal has always been to substitute less expensive nurse practitioners and nurses for some physician services and one can expect to see a renewed impetus in this direction.</p>
<p>The more interesting question is not what the Ontario government is going to try but how the public will react to these changes, especially if they affect access to medical care? The rest of the country will be watching.</p>
<p>Livio Di Matteo is a professor of economics at Lakehead University and recently published a study on the sustainability of provincial government health spending in the European Journal of Health Economics.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Air travel biz has ups and downs; "If you're a tour packager and airline operator, you'd better be prepared to roll with the punches."</b>
</div><div>PETER HADEKEL    </div>
<div>Freelance</div>

<p>The travel business is a great business to be in, if you don't mind the occasional hiccup: the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Great Recession of 2008-09, the H1N1 global scare or the odd belching volcano that shuts down European airspace.</p>
<p>If you're a tour packager and airline operator like Jean-Marc Eustache, president and chief executive officer of Montreal-based Transat AT, you'd better be prepared to roll with the punches.</p>
<p>"My friends tell me I am crazy to be in this business," Eustache said yesterday after a speech to the Montreal Board of Trade.</p>
<p>The cloud of ash from that volcano in Iceland has cost world airlines hundreds of millions of dollars a day in lost business, although some European airports began to reopen yesterday.</p>
<p>Transat, which has the largest market share among Canadian tour operators in France and the second largest in Britain, isn't too concerned yet.</p>
<p>"It's just the start of the season for us in Europe," Eustache said, "so we have only a few flights right now and we're managing relatively well."</p>
<p>As of yesterday, Transat had a "few hundred" customers stranded on both sides of the Atlantic and waiting for a flight. It was planning to pick up some at London's Gatwick airport and in Brussels.</p>
<p>"Obviously, if we'd had this problem in July or August, the situation would be very different." Eustache checked the company's bookings for the European travel season and they look normal so far.</p>
<p>While European airlines already are asking their governments for financial compensation for the airport shutdown, Transat isn't making any such requests just yet. "We haven't had the time to figure out how much it has cost us," he said. But he didn't rule out a request for help if the situation persists.</p>
<p>Of more pressing concern for Eustache yesterday was the declining state of Canada's tourism industry. In his speech, he noted international visits to Canada have declined by nearly 20 per cent since 2002, while world tourism has grown by 30 per cent over the same period.</p>
<p>Complacent after years of good growth, the tourism industry in this country is costly and uncompetitive with many other destinations around the world, he argued.</p>
<p>"For years, we reaped the benefits of limited competition, and a weak currency that made us an accessible destination. Those days are now gone.</p>
<p>"Ask people what is keeping them from coming here, and the answers you'll most often get are: it's too expensive, it's too far, I have no reason to go and there are other places."</p>
<p>Transat, with annual revenues of $3.5 billion, markets Canada in Europe, Asia and Latin America, but derives less than four per cent of its sales from selling tour packages to Canada.</p>
<p>It's time, he said, for the Canadian government to take action to help the industry compete against fast-growing tourist hotspots in the emerging world.</p>
<p>Lowering airport taxes and surcharges and improving tourism infrastructure would be a start. Ottawa recently announced a 50-per-cent increase in the Air Travellers Security Charge on international flights, a measure which, while intended to enhance security, will help Canada price itself out of the market, Eustache noted.</p>
<p>And it's time to stop charging rent to private authorities that operate Canada's airports, he said. "Hundreds of millions of dollars are quietly flowing into the government's coffers in Ottawa every year. We must stop viewing this industry as a cash cow."</p>
<p>In what he described as another example of misguided policy, Transat is "furious" with the federal government for its decision last year to require visas for visitors from Mexico.</p>
<p>That country offers a good potential market for tourism to Canada. But Ottawa now demands a visa application in English or French, including information on education, employment, salary, even bank statements and pay stubs, he complained.</p>
<p>"It's an insult." In 2008, Canada welcomed 270,000 tourists from Mexico, but the number dropped 37 per cent last year.</p>
<p>Another complaint: Eustache wants provincial authorities and credit-card companies to come up with a better and less costly way to refund consumers who don't get promised services.</p>
<p>Forget that volcano. There are plenty of other problems that come first.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Millions could be wasted as H1N1 vaccine tossed; Best-before date lowered after antigen shown to decline in strength over time</b>
</div><div>Rob Shaw   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>739 words</div><div>21 April 2010</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>British Columbia could throw away almost $20 million worth of H1N1 vaccine because it went unused during swine-flu season and will soon expire.</p>
<p>Only 40 per cent of B.C.'s population chose to be vaccinated against H1N1, which meant roughly 2.5 million of the 4.3 million doses ordered by the province were unused, said Ida Chong, Minister of Healthy Living and Sport.</p>
<p>The government had planned to keep much of the leftover vaccine in case of another outbreak, because the doses were supposed to be good for 18 months.</p>
<p>However, on April 9, Health Canada abruptly reduced the best-before date to only six months because the adjuvanted H1N1 antigen was shown to decline in strength over time.</p>
<p>That left B.C. and other Canadian provinces with millions of leftover doses and an unexpectedly short expiration date. One batch of B.C.'s vaccine expired March 31, a second expires April 30 and a third expires May 31.</p>
<p>"This was not planned. This was a vaccine that, when we acquired it, we were advised had an 18-month shelf life," said Chong. "The fact it has been revised is something that has just come to our attention 10 days ago."</p>
<p>B.C.'s H1N1 vaccines were available free to the public late last year. The $34-million bill was split 60-40 between the federal and provincial governments, leaving B.C. to pay $13.7 million. A loss of 60 per cent of the vaccine could mean provincial taxpayers spent $8.22 million on unused vaccine.</p>
<p>Chong said it wasn't wasted money because Canadian provinces were advised to order enough vaccine for everyone as part of the country's pandemic plan.</p>
<p>"We would have, perhaps, been equally criticized if we hadn't purchased enough for each British Columbian," said Chong.</p>
<p>Still, the millions spent on unused vaccine comes at a time when the cash-strapped provincial government is slashing spending and eliminating jobs as it grapples with a $1.7-billion deficit.</p>
<p>Chong said the government is discussing the problem with Health Canada and vaccine manufacturer <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> to see what it can do with its surplus and whether it can recover any money.</p>
<p>The government purchased 50.4 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine on behalf of the provinces and vaccinated more than 45 per cent of the country.</p>
<p>Ottawa loaned five million doses of vaccine to Mexico in January, on the condition Mexico replenish Canada's supply months later.</p>
<p>The revised expiry date only applies to vaccine with a booster known as adjuvant, and is not a safety issue, according to Health Canada. B.C.'s stockpile of 34,000 unadjuvanted vaccinations will expire according to original timelines.</p>
<p>B.C.'s Opposition NDP said the government should review how it handled H1N1.</p>
<p>"Certainly it raises a big question about the management of the whole H1N1 vaccine program," said healthy-living critic Jagrup Brar.</p>
<p>Bear said he's asked for more information from government because, in fairness, it was an unprecedented event.</p>
<p>"At the same time, the government must be accountable to the people of British Columbia when it comes to how much vaccine was actually bought and how much was actually used and wasted," said Brar.</p>
<p>Other provincial governments have also been caught off-guard by the changes to vaccine expiry dates. Manitoba reportedly stands to lose $2 million worth of excess vaccine. Saskatchewan may have to dispose of 470,000 unused doses, at an unknown cost.</p>
<p>B.C.'s provincial health officer, Perry Kendall, said it's unfortunate many residents were unwilling to be vaccinated or were skeptical of the benefits and side-effects.</p>
<p>Still, a vaccination rate of 40 per cent of the population is enough to prevent a third wave of H1N1, said Kendall. The province will also include H1N1 as part of its seasonal flu shots this fall, he said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Chong said she'd like to see anyone in B.C. that was not vaccinated for H1N1 and is still interested to take advantage of the shots before they expire.</p>
<p>B.C. had 1,059 confirmed cases of H1N1 between April 2009 and February 2010.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flawed poll distorts scope of sexual abuse; Results hardly 'shocking' when you look at how the questions were framed</b>
</div><div>Reginald W. Bibby   </div>
<div>Freelance</div>
<div>1003 words</div><div>21 April 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>A week ago, an Ipsos-Reid poll was released, informing the nation that more than two million Canadians have family members, friends, or acquaintances who have been sexually abused by a Roman Catholic priest. The finding was described by the polling company as "astonishing" and "shocking." The senior vice-president of Ipsos, John Wright, told a Global National television audience the day of the release, "If we were experiencing H1N1 tomorrow with two million people, we would in fact shut down this country, because it would be a calamity. We're dealing with what appears to be an epidemic."</p>
<p>Such an alleged discovery in turn needs to be described as inaccurate and unnecessarily inflammatory.</p>
<p>Let me be clear from the outset. I have no pro-Catholic axe to grind. I also share with everyone else the need to denounce and respond to sexual abuse wherever it is found.</p>
<p>But the best interests of everyone are not served by hyperbole -- including hyperbole on the part of pollsters who should know better.</p>
<p>While I have much respect for Ipsos-Reid and John Wright, I have little respect for the claims surrounding this particular survey. If John were in my survey methods class, he would have received an "F" for this project.</p>
<p>The reason is fairly prosaic to anyone who reflects for a few moments on what such a survey actually tells us.</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, that Ipsos-Reid had asked Canadians, "Do you have family members, friends, or acquaintances who have been divorced?" I'd venture to say that the question would have resulted in as many as 90 per cent of people across the country saying, "Yes." Contrast this to the number of people who have personally been divorced -- my own latest national survey shows this figure is probably around 15 per cent.</p>
<p>The first question asks individuals about the people they know -- and who doesn't know someone who has been divorced? The other asks individuals about their own experiences. Awareness does not equal incidence. Both are important. But obviously they are two very different things.</p>
<p>Take teenage suicide as another example. If one is to equate awareness with an epidemic, here's a major one: our latest national youth survey has found that about one in three teenagers has a close friend who has attempted suicide. Does that mean that one in three -- or as many as one million Canadian teens -- have tried to take their lives? Of course not. In one school of 1,000 students, for example, teenagers may have two or three people in mind -- very serious, of course, but hardly an epidemic.</p>
<p>Ipsos-Reid probed awareness, not incidence. One person in a neighbourhood or larger community could have been assaulted -- and hundreds and maybe thousands of people would be aware of it. No time frame was given, meaning awareness of an incident could span up to 80 or 90 years -- not just the post-1950s, for example. In short, the reporting net was an extremely large one.</p>
<p>Again, I would emphasize that sexual abuse of children by priests or anyone else is a heard-wrenching tragedy that calls for a response. But let's not reduce the credibility of sexual abuse claims by dramatically exaggerating their incidence.</p>
<p>A second item in the survey that has received considerable media attention is the finding that 58 per cent of Canadians believe that Pope Benedict "has perpetuated a climate of silence and cover up around pedophile and hebephile priests."</p>
<p>Now that could be interesting and important information. The problem, however, as George Gallup pointed out sometime ago, is that we who poll people for a living have to pose questions that they have a mathematical chance of being able to answer. In this case, I hope that Ipsos-Reid, for starters, defined "hebephile" to respondents. (The word refers to a person attracted to youngsters at the age of puberty.) Furthermore, one cannot assume that everyone from British Columbia to Newfoundland knows who Pope Benedict is, or that abuse has taken place, or that the Pope himself has been linked to a coverup.</p>
<p>And to the extent respondents can meet those basic information criteria for being able to offer an informed response to the question, what I want to know is this: how on Earth do Canadians have the inside scoop on whether or not the Pope has been a part of the alleged scandal? A followup question to the effect of, "On what are you basing your opinion?" may have been extremely telling.</p>
<p>Obviously, most Canadians who offered a take were simply offering views based on information they have received from media and acquaintances. In short, the item doesn't tell us very much -- beyond Canadian conjecture.</p>
<p>Throughout my career as a chronicler of social and religious trends in Canada, I have felt pretty much like the reporter sitting up in the press box, calling the game as I see it. Individuals and groups may not like what I write and say. But I have always tried to be objective, fair, and academically sound.</p>
<p>I know Ipsos-Reid and John Wright have the same aspirations. However, this particular poll and interpretations did not meet their usual high standard. Of considerable importance, if we were only having an academic debate, we could shake hands at the end of the session, and go out together for dinner, with the world continuing on pretty much the same.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the results and their dissemination have the potential to have a significant impact on public perception, the Roman Catholic Church, and Catholics across the country. That's why a few hands like mine need to be raised.</p>

<p>The doctor who would become the Canadian face of pandemic prevention was struggling to appear calm while under attack at a parliamentary subcommittee one year ago this week.</p>
<p>Chief Public Health Officer David Butler-Jones was being grilled by MPs over the agency's handling of the listeriosis food contamination outbreak, but he had bigger worries on his mind when his BlackBerry started vibrating.</p>
<p>Frank Plummer, the top scientist at the National Microbiology Laboratory, had put the public health watchdog on high alert after his counterpart in Mexico reported a mysterious outbreak of a respiratory illness and asked if Canada could run an analysis.</p>
<p>"What she described was pretty alarming," Plummer recalled in an interview Monday. "My initial thought was this would be another SARS. That's what Mexico was thinking and why they got in touch with us because of our SARS experience."</p>
<p>After Butler-Jones finished his committee appearance, Plummer delivered the bad news. A novel and seemingly virulent flu had broken out in Mexico, was already appearing in California and heading for Canada.</p>
<p>Three days later, swine flu cases were reported in Nova Scotia and British Columbia. An early-stage pandemic had taken flight around the world.</p>
<p>Now one year, roughly 15-million vaccine injections and almost $500 million in federal money later (excluding provincial contributions), pandemic post-mortems are being carried out because, inevitably, there will be another.</p>
<p>There's talk of increasing the number of vaccine suppliers or changing the distribution network to include more front-line physicians, but the bottom line is how to use this pandemic's finish line as the starting gate for coping with the next one.</p>
<p>One idea not up for discussion or debate is reduced prevention or immunization, despite the fizzle of last year's pint-sized pandemic.</p>
<p>Money was arguably squandered on the vaccination program, where millions of doses will be discarded and the supplier is rumoured to be voluntarily curtailing delivery of what would be even more surplus product. Yet it's hard to argue against viewing excess vaccine capacity as catastrophic insurance against an innocuous flu suddenly morphing into the doomsday virus.</p>
<p>The greater medical community apprehension is that the unprecedented pandemic response worked so well that Canadians will become complacent about immunization when the next outbreak strikes.</p>
<p>"The potential to have had a highly virulent new strain becoming a pandemic was likely and the fact we mounted a worldwide vaccine endeavour was necessary," insists Anne Doig, president of the Canadian Medical Association. "You can't predict the seriousness of pandemics in advance. If you don't get the vaccine ready and out there and it turns out to be a really nasty thing like SARS, then you've got people screaming public health didn't do its job."</p>
<p>The political face of the outbreak was Leona Aglukkaq, a rookie MP.</p>
<p>She was the Nunavut health minister during the SARS outbreak that was poorly communicated to confused territorial residents, so she did the right thing and demanded public health officials provide regular and reliable information as a top priority.</p>
<p>But ask her the most important lesson learned from the experience and she immediately goes partisan, recalling the time when H1N1 supplies shipped to a northern Manitoba First Nation included an obvious oversupply of body bags.</p>
<p>"Opposition critics creating pictures of body bags. How does that serve public health?" she fumed in an interview. "It is absolutely pathetic, in my opinion as an aboriginal person, to be used as a punching bag in the middle of a pandemic. If there is a lesson to be learned, Canadians should say that is unacceptable."</p>
<p>Even David Butler-Jones was bothered at political considerations raised in the House of Commons when single-source vaccine supplier <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> was challenged for halting production to make a safer version of the vaccine for pregnant women.</p>
<p>"The kind of things that keep me awake at night was how to say that the decision made by a previous (Liberal) government was actually a good decision, so why are they (Liberal MPs) criticizing a very good decision that put Canada in position of having the best and most secure supply of vaccine in the world?"</p>
<p>The next pandemic could be four months or 40 years away, but this particular H1N1 is likely finished, he adds.</p>
<p>Yet it created an unexpected legacy beyond the ubiquitous hand sterilizers in most office buildings.</p>
<p>"People say in international airports you could always spot the Canadians because they were coughing into their sleeve," grins Butler-Jones. "Given how we were all brought up to cover our cough or sneeze with our hand, to see that behaviour change in a matter of months is really quite amazing."</p>

</p>
<p>Two more conspiracy theories have collided with inconvenient facts, though it is the nature of these things that the conspiracies will persist anyway. Still, it is useful to look at the new evidence.</p>
<p>Conspiracy No. 1: Governments are hiding the fact that the H1N1 flu vaccine will make people sick, largely through a rare neurological condition called Guillain-Barré syndrome.</p>
<p>The truth: American health experts have now officially added up the Guillain-Barré cases. They found only 35 following H1N1 vaccination, in line with the number one would expect to occur naturally.</p>
<p>Theory No. 2: Climate researchers in England "cooked" their data to trick the public into thinking climate change is real, when it's not.</p>
<p>The truth: These were the scientists at the University of East Anglia whose e-mail correspondence, found by a hacker, showed them making some pretty venomous statements about critics who attack their work. Last week, however, a British review panel pronounced the climate research group guilty of sloppy record-keeping, but not of poor science. A panel member went farther in an interview later, calling them "squeaky clean."</p>
<p>The report concludes that "we found a small group of dedicated if slightly disorganized researchers" who did not store their data and working notes as well as they could have but whose science was conducted "with integrity."</p>
<p>Now of the two conspiracies, the British one -- a.k.a. "climategate" -- is most likely to endure. (H1N1, whether you took the vaccine or not, will eventually fizzle out like all flu virus mutations, and allegations about the vaccine will fade.)</p>
<p>If the enviro-paranoiacs could break away from looking for sinister hoaxes, and channel their skepticism in more useful ways, they might find some climate news that actually improves, rather than diminishes, the quality of public policy debate. For the fact is that climate science still has some surprises for us.</p>
<p>Here's one, new in recent weeks: Greenland isn't melting in the way people feared it would.</p>
<p>One of the great fears has been that massive melting of Arctic and Antarctic ice will raise sea levels everywhere. But while massive icebergs have indeed broken away from Antarctica, they aren't doing the same on the edge of Greenland.</p>
<p>New research suggests, surprisingly, that Greenland is paradoxically protected by recent warming. Since Greenland is warmer than Antarctica, the island's melting follows a different pattern, according to glaciologists at Penn State University. The Greenland meltwater manages to pour down crevasses to the sea without splitting off massive ice shelves.</p>
<p>As Antarctica warms, they theorize, that continent may shift over to the Greenland pattern, which would reduce the amount of fresh water pouring into the ocean.</p>
<p>It's all theoretical, but that is the point. Climate science is a vibrant and evolving area, for those willing to see the testing and re-testing of ideas as a sign of intellectual strength. There are supposed to be changes in any scientific theory, from quantum mechanics to the treatment of the common cold, as new evidence appears.</p>
<p>And what of the conspiracists? The head of Britain's review panel last week found their attacks "just plain nasty and ill-informed." Of course, that only makes him part of the conspiracy.</p>

</div><div>JUSTINE HUNTER   </div>

<p>VICTORIA -- After a massive crush last fall to get the H1N1 vaccine into arms, B.C. is now looking at flushing 2.5 million doses – $20-million worth – down the toilet.</p>
<p>Healthy Living Minister Ida Chong said yesterday the vaccine was billed as having a shelf life of 18 months, but earlier this month Health Canada revised the expiration date to just six months. That means some of the remaining vaccine has already passed its best-before date and the rest will expire in the next six weeks.</p>
<p>“Nobody likes to see unused vaccines discarded,” Ms. Chong said. “It's not a question of being bitter. We agreed to this plan, it was the step we had to take.”</p>
<p>Last fall, under the national pandemic plan, B.C. ordered enough vaccine for every individual in the province. It was part of a deal to share the cost of the vaccine with Ottawa.</p>
<p>Initially, health officials couldn't get the vaccine out fast enough to meet demand. There were long lineups across the country and anger bubbled over at queue-jumping by groups who were not initially eligible.</p>
<p>But as concerns about the H1N1 flu waned, B.C. was left with a huge stockpile – only 40 per cent of British Columbians ended up getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>Ms. Chong suggested those who did not get the vaccine should still consider it before the stock is tossed out.</p>
<p>“We don't know if there is going to be another wave,” she said. “It doesn't hurt if you have a compromised immune system.”</p>
<p>She said negotiations are now under way to see if some of the money paid up front for the vaccine can be reclaimed from the manufacturers, as some of the stock has yet to be delivered.</p>
<p>And B.C. will be asking Ottawa to reconsider its pandemic plan, which requires the provinces to purchase enough vaccine for every individual.</p>

<p>Strini Reddy doesn't like the limelight, but that's where he and 34 other individuals, groups and businesses were Tuesday night at the 27th annual Volunteer Manitoba awards dinner and ceremony.</p>
<p>The event recognizes those judged to be the province's best and brightest volunteers.</p>
<p>Reddy, 71, was among this elite group Volunteer Manitoba recognizes for their efforts to better the lives around them.</p>
<p>"This evening is a recognition of all the people in this community who put in their time for so many good causes," Reddy said.</p>
<p>"Without them we wouldn't have the opportunities that we have."</p>
<p>Reddy, who was the first superintendent of the Frontier School Division and is now retired, was the recipient of the RBC Royal Bank Local Hero Award, which recognized his work with the Winnipeg Boys and Girls Club, particularly its Summer Learning Enrichment program, which helps 480 inner-city school children across Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Reddy said the thousand of individuals who volunteer in communities across the province do so not just out of the goodness of their hearts, but because they recognize that it's a responsibility they all share.</p>
<p>"It's a responsibility that we should contribute to the benefit of everyone as much as we can."</p>
<p>Dennis Dyck, the volunteer executive director of Volunteer Manitoba, said the event formally recognizes the contributions of only a handful of individuals, businesses and organizations, but added the evening is a celebration for all volunteers across the province.</p>
<p>"If you don't have volunteers, you don't have a community," Dyck said.</p>
<p>"Governments could not function without volunteers. Every aspect of our lives is touched by volunteers."</p>
<p>Dyck said the dinner and awards ceremony is attended by groups who do volunteer work in the community and by the corporate community whose employees are active volunteers.</p>
<p>The awards singled out 23 individuals and 12 businesses and organizations for their volunteer efforts.</p>
<p>The first awards were presented by Lt.-Gov. Philip Lee, who presented seven individuals from across the province with the Lieutenant Governor's Make a Difference Award.</p>
<p>Lee said his first nine months in office have helped him gain a greater appreciation for the extent of the contribution volunteers make in Manitoba.</p>
<p>The generosity of those who volunteer, Lee said, creates "a society that is better able to meet its needs."</p>
<p>Premier Greg Selinger and Mayor Sam Katz also presented awards during the evening.</p>
<p>While Tuesday night's event marked the awards's 27th anniversary, Dyck said the organization can trace its roots back to the Second World War, when volunteers were recognized for their efforts during those difficult times.</p>

<p>I'm happy that the backyard hen pilot is being considered here in Edmonton. I think it would be beneficial.</p>
<p>Imagine those whose lives would be enriched -- children, the elderly, low-income families, people allergic to pet hair, people with issues with mobility and/or isolation. Chickens are part of nature we can enjoy in the winter time; they would add to the diversions we are looking for during that season.</p>
<p>Chickens raised on such a small scale can be fed more expensive and healthier rations than commercial layer operations profitably would.</p>
<p>Their eggs are high in Omega 3 fatty acids and taste far better than eggs from the store. The hens could contribute to fertilizing a garden naturally.</p>
<p>Fear of diseases should not prevent us from teaching our children how food is grown. Salmonella and H1N1 occur less often than feared in tiny flocks raised without hormone and immune suppressing chemical treatments.</p>
<p>Having grown up on a farm, I learned early on about untreated food, disease prevention, animal care and training, hygiene and medical treatments. Imagine if more children here could experience all that, hands on. If any of my neighbours had the chance to raise chickens, I would welcome the idea and help them, in exchange for an egg or two.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Addams Family has changed, but not for the better Theatre review; Even Nathan Lane and Bebe Neuwirth can't save musical</b>
</div><div>Richard Ouzounian  Toronto Star   </div>

</p>
<p>NEW YORK -- NEW YORK-Is there anything sadder than trying to give an audience just what you think they want, even though it isn't what you wanted in the first place?</p>
<p>That is why The Addams Family may have set out to be the biggest musical comedy of the current Broadway season, but it has wound up being the biggest musical tragedy instead.</p>
<p>When producer Stuart Oken and his associates initially set out to turn the lethally lovable Charles Addams cartoons into a piece for the stage, they had some fascinating ideas.</p>
<p>To direct and design it, they turned to the team who made Shockheaded Peter such a grisly noir delight, Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch. Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, who had crafted such a solid script for Jersey Boys, were on line to do the book and Andrew Lippa, capable of mixing edginess with adorability, signed up to do the music and lyrics.</p>
<p>With a cast headed by Nathan Lane and Bebe Neuwirth, it sounded almost too good to be true. Imagine: a thinking person's commercial musical.</p>
<p>Well, beware of things that sound too good to be true. They usually are.</p>
<p>The Addams Family opened in Chicago this past December to mixed reviews that found it neither experimental fish nor conventional fowl. It seemed that the McDermott/Crouch duo just weren't delivering what everyone expected from a splashy musical. Big surprise!</p>
<p>I saw it shortly after the Chicago opening and found it a bit of a mess. There were lots of striking visual moments and intriguing jabs at creating a new kind of Gothic tunefest, but there was also an awful lot of second-rate conventional Broadway schtick being peddled as well.</p>
<p>Well, even though it sold out in the Windy City, that dread disease called out-of-town-panic (far more toxic than H1N1) took over. And while McDermott and Crouch kept their names on the program, Jerry Zaks was brought in as "creative consultant," which is kind of like a divorced woman telling her kids that the new boyfriend is really their "uncle."</p>
<p>There was a decade, from 1986 through 1996, when Zaks was magic on Broadway, the director of a string of hits. But the last solid success he steered to shore was a revival of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, 14 years ago.</p>
<p>Guess who starred in that? Nathan Lane.</p>
<p>Do I even have to tell you who also starred in Zaks' other big hit, Guys and Dolls? You get the picture.</p>
<p>Everyone concerned seemed to realize that there were only two solid commodities going for the show - its title and Lane - so they decided to deliver on the first and keep the second happy.</p>
<p>But it didn't work out that way.</p>
<p>What's now on the stage of the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre is perhaps funnier, in a kind of Borscht Belt way, than what happened in Chicago, and Lane has been given a lot more comedic opportunities, but they're all from the second or third shelf of the comedy shop.</p>
<p>Lane is so brilliant he can make us laugh at thin air, but that's almost what he seems to be conjuring with here. Lippa's music is not unappealing, but his lyrics are very light on jokes. And the stuff that Brickman and Elice contribute in the dialogue department is pretty weak as well.</p>
<p>It all means that Lane has to work pretty hard for his paycheque and the one thing Gomez Addams should never show is stress. Bebe Neuwirth has much less to do as Morticia, but she's able to slink through the show in sexy style. It's when Lippa and company try to construct a showstopper for her that they run into trouble.</p>
<p>The attempt to "normalize" the other characters by giving creepy Wednesday Addams (Krysta Rodriguez) a conventional boyfriend (Wesley Taylor) has been reduced a lot since Chicago. It means that Carolee Carmello, as the deeply neurotic mother of the BF, no longer stops the show as resoundingly as she once did, alas, but on the other hand you no longer feel like you're watching High School Musical Goes Goth, which was often the case before.</p>
<p>But nothing of any substance has been put in its place. In the end, The Addams Family is a lot of expensively mounted emptiness. Despite negative reviews, people are still buying tickets, which - for the time being - seems to indicate that a nation gets the musicals it deserves.</p>
<p>Bebe Neuwirth and Nathan Lane play Morticia and Gomez in the The Addams Family on Broadway.   </p>

<p>It's tough when a late-season meltdown by your coach and a controversy over alleged queue-jumping for the H1N1 vaccine are viewed from a distance as the two most significant occurrences in the brief history of a minor pro-hockey franchise.</p>
<p>At least the Abbotsford Heat, the farm team of the Calgary Flames, made the playoffs in the AHL. (Surprisingly, the parent Flames didn't do the same in the NHL, which explained the attendance Monday of Calgary president</p>
<p>Ken King.)</p>
<p>That all three Heat home games -- Monday, Wednesday and Friday against the Rochester Americans -- are on nights the Vancouver Canucks are playing the Los Angeles Kings, however, takes the celebration out of that bit of cheer.</p>
<p>Good luck and the Heat have pretty much been strangers this year. For example, six of their veteran regulars are injured and didn't dress for Game 3 of the opening round best-of-seven, which Rochester now leads 2-1 after an 8-4 victory Monday.</p>
<p>But none of it has dampened the enthusiasm of the Heat staff or the fans who took in the first-ever AHL playoff game in B.C., at the Abbotsford Entertainment and Sports Centre.</p>
<p>Justin McIntyre, vice-president of ticketing, spent the weekend beating the Heat drum at a kiosk in Seven Oaks Shopping Centre while the team was in Rochester, N.Y., splitting the first two games -a 3-2 win in the opener and a 4-1 loss in the second.</p>
<p>"Of all the teams I've worked for," said McIntyre, who has worked in ticket sales for the Canucks, the B.C. Lions, Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Blue Jays, "I've never seen people so passionate or loyal to the brand."</p>
<p>From the west side of the Port Mann Bridge you might guffaw at a claim like that. But hockey fans on that side of the Fraser only know the Canucks or the WHL's Giants. They wouldn't know an Abbotsford Heat from a Langley Chief.</p>
<p>If you're interested, it's not a long step below the Stanley Cup playoffs. You just don't know the names of most of the players. The Heat is marketing to the million or so folks from Surrey, Langley and Mission, anyway.</p>
<p>At least, that was before coach Jim Playfair performed his tirade March 27 when the Hamilton Bulldogs were in town, and more than 1.6 million went on the Internet to watch it, courtesy of <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.</p>
<p>Turns out losing his cool and breaking sticks and shedding his jacket wasn't such a bad thing: Columbus, it's rumoured, is looking hard at him to replace Ken Hitchcock. As suggested, however, the Heat's luck hasn't been so good otherwise.</p>
<p>Nobody knows, for instance, that they went 8-1 on a February road trip. It happened during the Olympics and fans of every stripe were otherwise occupied cheering on our cross-country skiers and curlers of both genders and having a grand time every night downtown.</p>
<p>The Heat lost more than 400 man games to injuries and still managed to finish the regular season 39-29-5-7.</p>
<p>With luck, their first-round playoff opponent would have been the Manitoba Moose, the Vancouver farm hands. In four games during the regular season, the Moose totalled 28,887 in paid attendance, with two of those nights sold out.</p>
<p>Assuming they get past Rochester, the Heat could get Manitoba in the second round. Considering history and that the Moose lost its first two of the series 2-0 and 8-2 in Hamilton, nobody's counting chickens or gate receipts.</p>
<p>But with a change in luck ...</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Volcanic memory of the fear of the unknown</b>
</div><div>Robyn T. Braley   </div>
<div>For The Calgary Herald</div>
<div>822 words</div><div>19 April 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>The headline in Friday's Herald about the havoc wreaked by the volcanic eruption in Iceland brought back vivid memories of 1980.</p>
<p>I was reminded that natural or man-made disasters carry two levels of terror -- the real and the imagined. We experienced this with 9/11 and more recently with the H1N1 epidemic.</p>
<p>Sometimes the imagined is even more disturbing than the reality of the event.</p>
<p>In 1980 my wife Meg and I were professional gospel singers. Some may remember us as the music producers and regular artists on the television ministry To You . . . With Love, which was broadcast on CTV for about 20 years.</p>
<p>That summer we were booked for a series of concerts scheduled through Montana, Washington and Oregon. On Sunday, May 18, 1980, we were in Libby, Mont.</p>
<p>In the morning we had a concert south of Kalispell. That afternoon we enjoyed a blue-sky, three-hour hour mountain drive to Libby. As we listened to music, we were oblivious to the natural disaster that was unfolding at Mount St. Helens just seven hours to the west.</p>
<p>The volcano had erupted early that morning.</p>
<p>The concert began at 6 p.m. and lasted about 90 minutes. After, the kids, who were the first to go outside the church, started running back in shouting that it was snowing. That seemed odd in May, but Montana is close to Alberta so anything weather-wise is possible.</p>
<p>Panic started to set in as adults realized what was happening. They quickly gathered their families and headed for home and shelter from the unknown. Still not realizing the impact of what had happened, we quickly packed up our sound system and headed out on the 1 ½-hour drive to Kalispell, where we were headquartered.</p>
<p>The air was thick with particles of ash floating from the sky. Soon the ash blotted out the sun. It seemed like we were inside a wood stove that day after a hot raging fire had burned itself out. The ash settled on our windshield and was turned to a grey paste by the windshield washer fluid.</p>
<p>We listened to the emergency broadcasting on the radio as they reported on the unknown. The eruption was the first in North America for many years. The unknown brought an element of terror and panic.</p>
<p>The first instruction was to fill bathtubs, pots and pans with water. It was not clear whether the settling ash would contaminate fresh water supplies.</p>
<p>The second recommended not breathing in the ash. We were told to fashion a cloth mask to filter the air. Not doing so could mean an agonizing death. Finally, people were cautioned not to drive. Engines would seize up from sucking in ash.</p>
<p>But Meg and I were already committed. We finally made it by driving 40 km/h. The entire city was shut down -- much like Calgary during a spring snow storm.</p>
<p>The next day the few people who ventured outside wore surgical masks, much like those worn during the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>We headed back to Calgary and learned that the ash cloud had followed a set path toward the East Coast and on to Europe. There was little evidence of what had happened by the time we reached the Canadian border.</p>
<p>Through that summer we had concerts scheduled back in the region.</p>
<p>We learned that Seattle, only a short distance away, received a lighter dusting than New York because the wind carried the cloud east.</p>
<p>Moses Lake, on the east side, was blacked out by 10 a.m. that fateful Sunday.</p>
<p>It took months and many trucks loads of ash to clear the roads and parking lots.</p>
<p>I remember mountains of ash left along highway interchanges that looked like the piles of dirty snow we see in shopping centre parking lots near the end of February.</p>
<p>Fear of crop damage dissipated over the next few years as farmers learned of the fertilizer properties of the ash. I can still remember watching combines in the fields in August causing great clouds of ash to billow into the sky. Years of rainfall, which is light in central Washington during the best of times, failed to completely wash away the gritty paste.</p>
<p>But the most sobering image remains burned into my memory. That summer I remember driving south on Interstate 5 and seeing the ragged top of Mount St. Helens on the left, the destruction of the mudslides from the top of the mountain into the valley, and then the twin stacks of an atomic energy plant to the right. Mudslides, volcanic eruptions and an atomic energy plant.</p>
<p>The memory certainly brings pause for thought of how much worse the catastrophe could have been.</p>

<p>Amburlea Carlson still remembers the day she was taken to hospital by ambulance.</p>
<p>It was last September, and the pregnant Alberta woman's coughing was so severe she went into premature labour. Only at hospital in Calgary did her contractions stop.</p>
<p>The previously healthy 29-year-old had contracted H1N1.</p>
<p>Within just three days, she was put into an induced coma at Foothills Medical Centre. She would spend nearly the next three months fighting for her life.</p>
<p>Carlson's tale of survival -- and that of her baby -- comprise one of the remarkable stories to emerge from the Canada's battle with the swine flu, a condition that began making international headlines one year ago.</p>
<p>"There's no reason that we both should have made it. I just don't understand. I still don't," Carlson says.</p>
<p>It was one year ago that the World Health Organization began to monitor an "atypical pneumonia" in Oaxaca State of Mexico.</p>
<p>Within days, more cases were being reported in the country as well as the United States. A week later, there were 20 confirmed deaths in Mexico from H1N1.</p>
<p>The condition would reach Canada, triggering the largest vaccination campaign in this country's history.</p>
<p>For almost three months last fall, Carlson was placed in an induced coma to help her body accept the life-support equipment as she battled the flu virus.</p>
<p>Every day, her parents visited, suiting up in special gowns, rubber gloves, face masks and visors. They sat with their daughter, held her hand, talked and played <span class="companylink">Disney</span> songs from the woman's childhood.</p>
<p>"I never thought Ambur, when she first went in, would actually be facing a death sentence," says her mother Karen Carlson. "She definitely was knocking on death's door plenty of times."</p>
<p>Carlson says she remembers moments from her time in the coma. She recalls her father speaking to her and her mother playing her music.</p>
<p>In December, as she had only just come out of her coma, she was wheeled into an operating room and a caesarean section was performed to deliver her baby daughter. Doctors had feared that if the baby remained inside much longer, both mother and child would die.</p>
<p>That little girl was little more than two pounds. She, too, has survived, and earlier this month little Briar Rose Carlson was brought home for the first time.</p>
<p>"She's a miracle," Carlson says. "There's no way she should have made it."</p>
<p>When her daughter was born, the baby's prognosis was so touch-and-go that Carlson says staff were hesitant to tell her the child was alive, fearing she would soon die.</p>
<p>But things have changed so much since those dire days.</p>
<p>This month, Briar was able to follow her mother's path and left the hospital for home with her mother in Strathmore, Alta.</p>
<p>She still wears a breathing tube. Her mother says she will need surgery on her eyes and still requires checkups with specialists three or four times a week.</p>
<p>Carlson credits her survival and that of her daughter to several things: the staff at the Foothills Hospital in Calgary, the strength of her family and the prayers that were made.</p>
<p>"I still don't understand why we made it."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The fight of their lives; Amid last year's devastating H1N1 outbreak, a Strathmore woman and her baby, born days after her mom emerged from a coma, defied the odds to survive; ; Effects linger a year after outbreak</b>
</div><div>Richard Cuthbertson   </div>

</p>
<p>The noise: that's one thing Karen Carlson remembers about the isolation hospital room with the sliding glass door that held her daughter for weeks.</p>
<p>One of the machines that kept Amburlea Carlson alive hummed like the sound of a small helicopter as the pregnant woman fought for her life after contracting H1N1 and being admitted to the Foothills Medical Centre in September.</p>
<p>And fight she did. For almost three months last fall, the previously healthy 29-year-old was in an induced coma to help her body accept life-support equipment as she battled the flu virus -- one of more than 1,200 Albertans hospitalized with H1N1 last year.</p>
<p>Her story is one of the most incredible.</p>
<p>Every day, Amburlea's parents visited her, suiting up in gowns, rubber gloves, face masks and visors. They sat with her, held her hand, talked and played <span class="companylink">Disney</span> songs from the woman's childhood.</p>
<p>"I never thought Ambur, when she first went in, would actually be facing a death sentence," Karen Carlson says. "She definitely was knocking on death's door plenty of times."</p>
<p>But death did not take Amburlea.</p>
<p>Today, the woman is home in Strathmore. Her voice is weakened, she still has some trouble walking, and the left side of her body doesn't work as well as her right. But she's alive.</p>
<p>Still, the fact Amburlea survived is only one astonishing part if this story.</p>
<p>In December, as Amburlea had only just come out of her coma, she was wheeled into an operating room and a caesarean section was performed to deliver her baby daughter. Doctors had feared if the baby remained inside much longer, both mother and child would die.</p>
<p>That baby girl was little more than two pounds. She, too, has survived, and earlier this month Briar Rose Carlson was brought home for the first time.</p>
<p>"There's no reason that we both should have made it. I just don't understand. I still don't," Amburlea says. "She's a miracle. There's no way she should have made it."</p>
<p>It was one year ago that the World Health Organization began to monitor an "atypical pneumonia" in Oaxaca state of Mexico.</p>
<p>Within days, more cases were being reported in the country, as well as the United States. A week later, there were 20 confirmed deaths in Mexico from H1N1.</p>
<p>Just more than a week after the WHO began investigating those early cases, Alberta's chief medical officer put the province's health system on alert.</p>
<p>A year later, H1N1 has proved one of the first major tests of Alberta's pandemic response, revealing both flaws and resiliency in the system.</p>
<p>In this province, the treatment of patients and vaccines for the population have cost about $148 million.</p>
<p>Seventy-one people with the virus died in Alberta, and 1,278 were hospitalized.</p>
<p>Roughly 1.25 million doses of vaccine have been administered and, at the height of the vaccination rollout, 60,000 Albertans a day were being immunized.</p>
<p>April 28, 2009, is a pivotal moment in Alberta's H1N1 history. On that day, the province announced its first two confirmed cases of the flu virus. Both men had recently returned from Mexico and their symptoms were mild.</p>
<p>It is also the day that Tina L'Hirondelle died in a High Prairie hospital. The 39-year-old had a history of asthma and diabetes. A little more than a week later, tests confirmed the woman had H1N1, making her the first infected person in Canada to die.</p>
<p>April 28 also proved to be a nightmare for Leslieville pig farmer Arnold Van Ginkel.</p>
<p>After arriving from Holland in 2003, the dream farm he had built with his family was now in tatters, his entire herd placed under quarantine.</p>
<p>Worried that some of his roughly 2,200 pigs were coughing, Van Ginkel had called the veterinarian. H1N1 was soon suspected.</p>
<p>The swine flu, as it is sometimes known, has been around since the 1920s in various forms, according to Alberta's chief veterinarian, Gerald Hauer. It's not unusual to have several cases in Alberta: last year five herds in the province contracted regular swine flu, and there were a further six suspected incidents.</p>
<p>What was different here was that Van Ginkel's herd was contracting this new strain -- the same that was setting off pandemic alarm bells.</p>
<p>Unable to ship out any of his pigs, Van Ginkel's barn was quickly overcrowding as his herd reproduced, he noted in a recent interview. Then, of course, there was the negative publicity his problem brought to the industry, even though the pork is still safe to eat.</p>
<p>The only solution, as he saw it, was to destroy his entire herd. "Pretty tough, especially in the beginning," he says.</p>
<p>Every morning, Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, receives an e-mail in his inbox from a service that scans the world for health news.</p>
<p>One morning in April, that e-mail brought with it a warning of "something odd" in Mexico. Reports of infections in the southern United States soon followed.</p>
<p>Within days of the reports, the province's health system had been put on alert. Of particular concern, Corriveau remembers, was that so many Albertans holiday in Mexico during that time of year.</p>
<p>Part of the alert meant that</p>
<p>samples were now being taken from Albertans with flu symptoms if they had recently returned from Mexico. Soon, the provincial lab was able perform a sequence of tests to isolate the novel strain and develop a tool kit to diagnosis the virus.</p>
<p>By June, Calgary intensivecare units began to see their first seriously ill H1N1 patients, recalls Dr. Tom Stelfox, an intensive-care specialist.</p>
<p>Other hospitals in the province had already admitted severely ill patients, including an Edmonton area girl in early May.</p>
<p>But that first wave ended by late July and a lull set in, Stelfox said, allowing officials to begin ramping up plans for the fall wave.</p>
<p>More ventilators were purchased with the expectation that severe cases of H1N1 would rise, Corriveau said.</p>
<p>Communication plans were finalized so information on the location of free intensive-care beds and ventilators could be quickly disseminated, Stelfox said.</p>
<p>That lull, of course, was not to last. As fall hit, the second wave crashed into Alberta. People began missing work, family doctors were receiving patients, emergency rooms began filling, as did intensivecare units.</p>
<p>Oct. 26, 2009, is also a date that should be etched in Alberta's H1N1 history.</p>
<p>On the same day the province flung open the doors of clinics to kick-start the mass-vaccination effort, a 13-year-old boy named Evan Frustaglio died at a Toronto hospital.</p>
<p>Some call his death a game-changer. The next day it was confirmed the previously healthy teen who enjoyed playing hockey had died from complications related to the flu virus.</p>
<p>Across Alberta, risk-averse parents took stock of that case and rushed to get their families vaccinated, according to Dr. Tom Noseworthy, a health policy expert at the University of Calgary.</p>
<p>Health officials had thought they would have to drag people to the clinics with a compelling message, Noseworthy said. Suddenly, lineups appeared far beyond what anybody expected.</p>
<p>"They weren't ready for an avalanche-like effect," he said.</p>
<p>If there's anything Albertans will remember about the early days of the H1N1 vaccine rollout, it's the enormous waits that greeted people looking to a get their shot.</p>
<p>The stories have become almost legendary: people in line for up to eight hours in the cold and reports of some even waiting overnight, as if an H1N1 needle was equivalent to coveted concert tickets.</p>
<p>But Corriveau suggests other factors were at play. Alberta, he said, was hit with H1N1 about two weeks earlier than Eastern Canada.</p>
<p>When the vaccine became available, people in this province saw a greater urgency to get immunized, given family members, friends and coworkers around them were getting sick.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there was the issue of who should receive vaccination first. In the early days, while encouraging high-risk groups to get immunized, all Albertans were accepted.</p>
<p>By the end of week, another significant problem emerged: the vaccine manufacturer couldn't produce enough vaccine to keep Alberta, and other provinces, well stocked.</p>
<p>The decision to temporarily close vaccination clinics was made over the Halloween weekend, Corriveau recalls.</p>
<p>After consultation with health officials, he made the call to then-health minister Ron Liepert to give him the bad news.</p>
<p>By early November clinics were up and running again. But this time strict rules regulating who was getting vaccinated were in place.</p>
<p>At the same time, intensivecare units in the city had reached capacity.</p>
<p>At the height of the pandemic, Stelfox estimates up to half the beds were taken by patients with H1N1.</p>
<p>Anyone suspected of having the flu virus was sequestered from non-infected patients.</p>
<p>Most had to be placed on some sort of life sustaining therapy, such as breathing tubes and ventilators. Several of the most severe cases were given a therapy rarely used in Calgary.</p>
<p>A special device took blood from the body, removing carbon dioxide and inserting oxygen, before transferring it back into the person.</p>
<p>"Many of these patients had very severe failures of their lungs," Stelfox said.</p>
<p>A couple of things stick out in Stelfox's mind. He remembers the "humanity" around him, of how hard doctors, nurses and other staff worked.</p>
<p>He remarks on the professionalism, given that, in the beginning, vaccine was not yet available and they were working with patients who were sick with an easily transmitted virus. There was the psychological and physical discomfort suffered by nurses and other staff who spent long hours in hot rooms dressed in clothing to protect themselves from contracting the virus.</p>
<p>The doctor also noted the bad moments. In one case, he had to tell a family that their loved one had passed away.</p>
<p>Then, there is the marvel of medical technology, which Stelfox says saved many lives.</p>
<p>"We could be fairly comfortable in saying that almost all of the patients that got really sick, and who were admitted to intensive-care units, none of those patients would have had a chance of surviving in previous pandemics," he said. "But because of the advances in medicine, they had a chance of surviving in the current pandemic."</p>
<p>The peak, Stelfox says, was late October and early into the next month. By mid-November, they sensed the worst was over.</p>
<p>Fewer people were getting severely sick. The lineups at vaccination clinics began to decline.</p>
<p>Today, things have returned to normal on Van Ginkel's farm. After his herd was culled, the barn had to be thoroughly cleaned and undergo inspections by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.</p>
<p>By August, the farmer had bought more sows. He also received some compensation from the provincial and federal governments, although he declines to say how much.</p>
<p>His herd now numbers between 2,500 and 3,000, and is back to the strength it was a year ago, before H1N1 hit.</p>
<p>By December 2009, it was clear the second wave of H1N1 was dissipating. Corriveau took his first holiday since the outbreak began. He went to Yellowknife, where his wife still lives, enjoying the comforts of home and cross-country skiing.</p>
<p>In the early days of the vaccine rollout, Noseworthy was highly critical of the province. His stance had softened significantly.</p>
<p>In retrospect, he believes the health system in Alberta did a "damn good job."</p>
<p>By January, after a tortuous four months in hospital, Amburlea Carlson was finally well enough to be discharged.</p>
<p>She still remembers the September day she was taken to hospital by ambulance. Her coughing was so severe she went into premature labour, and only at hospital did the contractions stop.</p>
<p>Within just three days she was put in a coma, induced so her body would accept the life-support machines that were to keep her alive for months.</p>
<p>Even so, she remembers moments from that time. She recalls her father speaking to her and her mother playing her music.</p>
<p>Amburlea has sung since she was a child. But all those tubes down her throat have taken their toll. She won't be able to sing again.</p>
<p>When her daughter was born, the baby's prognosis was so touch and go that Amburlea says staff were hesitant to tell her she was alive, fearing she would soon die.</p>
<p>But things have changed so much since those dire days.</p>
<p>Just earlier this month, Briar was able to follow her mother's path and left hospital for home.</p>
<p>She still wears a breathing tube. Her mother says she will need surgery on her eyes and still requires checkups with specialists three or four times a week.</p>
<p>Amburlea credits her survival and that of her daughter to several things: the staff at the Foothills Hospital, the strength of her family and the prayers that were made.</p>
<p>"I still don't understand why we made it."</p>

<p>GM Steve Tambellini trades defenceman Steve Staios, Denis Grebeshkov and Lubomir Visnovsky for Aaron Johnson, draft picks and Ryan Whitney, at once slicing the team payroll and getting younger, as the rebuild begins in earnest.</p>
<p>Quinn's Quip:</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>-"It started off looking exactly like it was -two teams out of the playoffs and not caring how much they worked for the night. There has got to be more to this business than that. That's a sad state of affairs when you approach your profession by saying 'It's OK tonight because neither of us are in it.'</p>
<p>"We have people sitting up in the stands that come to watch us play and hopefully win. That's what cheeses you off. We have an attitude like that, even one single guy, then we have losers. That's the attitude you don't want any time. You can be in 30th. But you don't have to play like a 30th-place guy." -After a lacklustre 3-2 loss to Anaheim.</p>
<p>Bonus quip</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>"It wasn't anything we were trying to do, believe me. We were trying to be a good hockey club and it turned out we weren't much of a hockey club. We need to have the first pick and we need the pick to be a good one." -After the Oilers clinched last place overall with a 5-4 loss to Detroit.</p>

</p>
<p>Money can't buy me love -- but it can buy health.</p>
<p>It's one of those ugly facts of life. Rich people live longer, healthier lives than the poor.</p>
<p>In public health, it has become a cliché that the lower your income, the more likely you are to get sick - from infectious diseases such as tuberculosis or chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and lung cancer.</p>
<p>Last year's H1N1 pandemic could not have highlighted this more clearly. True, the virus put a strain on the health system here in Hamilton, but fortunately deaths were rare.</p>
<p>By contrast, H1N1 devastated communities that face more severe poverty. On reserves in northern Manitoba, whole communities became ill, and many people died. Mexico, where the swine flu virus originated, was overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Death tolls were much higher than in Canada, owing largely to poor nutrition and housing conditions that made it easy for the flu to spread.</p>
<p>So why is there such a variation in health even here in Canada, where access to health care is free to all?</p>
<p>If we are all using the same health care system, why are our poor so much sicker? The answer is that health care only accounts for about 25 per cent of health, maybe less.</p>
<p>Social and economic factors are far more important. Income is linked to health through access to adequate nutrition, housing, education, child care and personal health behaviours.</p>
<p>My first experience working in a First Nations community was in a nursing station in Lac Brochet, a tiny, remote reserve in northern Manitoba. Most people lived on social assistance of one form or another, well below the poverty line.</p>
<p>While a fortunate few in "Lac" had reasonable housing, many lived in plywood shacks with no running water. With families of eight to 12 crammed into two rooms, viruses and bacteria spread fast.</p>
<p>Milk cost $14 for a two-litre jug, but potato chips were cheap -- so adequate nutrition was hard to come by. Less than a quarter of adults had high school diplomas.</p>
<p>It was hard to see people living that way. As a medical student, all I could do was treat the illness that I saw. Throat, skin and lung infections were very common in my patients, and many did not live long enough to experience diseases such as heart disease.</p>
<p>At the time, I didn't know that the community had the highest rate of tuberculosis in the world. TB infection indicates poor overall health and is closely linked to poverty. At over 100 times the Canadian average, TB was more common in Lac Brochet than in the slums of South Africa.</p>
<p>Here in Hamilton, we are a lot more fortunate than the people living in the Third World conditions of Lac Brochet. No one has to live five or six crammed to a room. Virtually everyone has access to clean running water, and healthy food is much more readily available.</p>
<p>But as this Code Red project shows, we still have huge differences in health between neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>This is upsetting, but not surprising. Your neighbourhood is closely linked with your income, so the relationship with health outcomes should be expected. And while income differences within Hamilton are nothing like the differences between Hamilton and Lac Brochet, they are still enough to produce most of the differences in health that we see in Code Red.</p>
<p>Nutrition, child care and education represent some of the pathways linking income and health in Hamilton. Think of how much cheaper sugary, fatty, salty foods are, and what people on low incomes can afford.</p>
<p>Try to find high-quality child care at an affordable rate, and consider how important those early years are for building a strong base of learning and development for a child's future.</p>
<p>University tuition rates have skyrocketed. How hard would it would be for a family living on minimum wage to send their children to McMaster?</p>
<p>While virtually everyone in our city is better off than the majority of people in Lac Brochet, we still have huge gaps in health between our rich and poor for reasons such as these.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is hope here in Hamilton.</p>
<p>We live in a city where people are willing to put time, effort and money into caring for those who are less fortunate. We have made a collective commitment to make Hamilton the best place to raise a child because we recognize that happy, healthy children are more likely to grow up into happy, healthy adults, and more likely to build a happier, healthier community.</p>
<p>And this commitment is not just on paper. Hamiltonians donated almost $5 million to the United Way last year, and the Hamilton Community Foundation invested another $3.4 million in poverty reduction, strengthening neighbourhoods and protecting our environment.</p>
<p>Last year at a Hamilton Timeraiser event, young adults committed more than 3,000 hours of volunteer time -- a small fraction of the volunteer work being done in our city, but a big indication of how willing we are to give help when asked.</p>
<p>The municipal, provincial and federal governments are all contributing as well, but they need our help as citizens. Good political leadership doesn't come out of thin air -- but it will come when the people demand it. Politicians need us to support their efforts to improve the economic conditions of those less fortunate.</p>
<p>If you care about improving the health of people who are less fortunate, take the time to get involved in the political process by contacting your representative or speaking out in whatever way you can.</p>

</p>
<p>As Canadians we embrace values of shared responsibility and a collective destiny, and yet more than three million of us live in poverty.</p>
<p>A 2008 national poll found that 88 per cent of Canadians say Canada should try to distinguish itself in the world as a country where no person lives in poverty.</p>
<p>We have fallen far short of this goal as evidenced by the deepening economic disparity in many inner-city neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>Over the past 30 years, we as a city, province and country have made only incremental progress on the overall reduction of poverty. Today, one in nine Canadians still lives below the poverty line. This reality exists despite tremendous efforts by exceptional volunteers, charities, not-for-profit organizations, foundations and government partners.</p>
<p>Is poverty not a serious enough problem to merit an immediate solution? Is poverty too expensive to fix? Or is poverty simply too complex for us as a community to find appropriate, sustainable solutions?</p>
<p>To the first question, countless reports, longitudinal studies and investigations written over the past 30 years suggest that poverty is sickening -- literally.</p>
<p>The total number of individuals affected by poverty far exceeds the number of individuals affected by SARS, H1N1, C difficile and West Nile virus combined, and has far more serious individual and population health outcomes.</p>
<p>As early as 1967, researchers such as Sir Michael Marmot have repeatedly shown that the higher a person's income or social status, the healthier and longer life that person will enjoy. Reductions in lifespan and other negative health outcomes caused by poverty are catastrophic public health issues.</p>
<p>To the second question, economic cost is an important consideration when mounting a response to a serious health problem; but so is the cost of not mounting an adequate response.</p>
<p>According to a 2008 Ontario Association of Food Banks report, failure to eliminate poverty costs the private and public sectors in Ontario more than $30 billion a year. Put another way, this report states, "In real terms, poverty costs every household in the province from $2,299 to $2,895 each year."</p>
<p>It takes investment to eliminate poverty. Yet continuing to pay for the negative health and social outcome costs are simply unaffordable.</p>
<p>To the third question, it's not poverty that is complex, it's the negative health outcomes caused by poverty that are complex.</p>
<p>The simple steps to reducing the risk of complex personal health issues are being active and eating well. The simple step to reducing the risk of negative health impacts caused by poverty is an adequate income.</p>
<p>With an adequate income, most can afford the necessary healthy food, shelter and discretionary income for their own and their children's participation in their community. And with some control over your own life comes dignity. Income is a simple prerequisite baseline for both personal and population health, similar to exercise and good nutrition.</p>
<p>Poverty is a catastrophic health issue, it costs us more than $30 billion per year in Ontario, and something as simple as an adequate income can significantly reduce its devastating effects. So why does poverty still exist?</p>
<p>The good news is there are solutions that could eliminate poverty in five years.</p>
<p>A solution to poverty, however, is not dependent on new knowledge; rather it is dependent on a fundamental shift in how we view it and the urgency we place on solving it. First, we need to change the conversation about poverty from "charity" to "health," and from "social cost" to "investment in human development."</p>
<p>Second, the urgency must be driven from our personal and our collective values, not our economics.</p>
<p>It's about personal values because although 88 per cent of us have stated we want to eliminate poverty, what percentage of us would agree to pay more for a cup of coffee to ensure those serving us had better health as a result of making a living and just wage? It's about collective values because politics and economics must always have direction, and that direction is set by our collective values.</p>
<p>Do we believe paying individuals a just, living wage for a hard day's work is critical to a person's health? Should we provide a combination of adequate income and supports to those who have a barrier to full employment due to a disability? Do we believe in providing adequate transitional support to help those unfortunate to be between jobs? And are we prepared to look at, and even experiment with, broad solutions such as a Guaranteed Annual Income that would ensure every working-age individual receives a living income thereby ensuring a baseline of personal health?</p>
<p>These are fair, just and simple solutions, but they will require courage driven by our values to enact.</p>
<p>Good values have always led good economics. Good values created the economics for immediate and complete responses to SARS and H1N1. Good values are the reason why child labour and slavery were abolished and universal health care and education introduced.</p>
<p>These value decisions did not destroy the economy, rather they strengthened it. If urgency is value driven, then we must act immediately to reflect our values in our government policies, the wages we pay in our businesses, and how we as individuals act to support an adequate income for everyone.</p>
<p>We don't need a perfect solution, we simply need a better one.</p>
<p>Poverty is an insult to our values.</p>
<p>Why does it still exist?</p>

<p>Marni Soupcoff's column is an affront to all the victims of the H1H1 virus. If the H1N1 virus was less lethal than the seasonal influenza virus, it was only because it cruelly favoured the young over the elderly. I have been working in intensive care units for 26 years and have never seen a young fatality from the seasonal flu. However, I had the misfortune of being involved in the care of two individuals under the age of 30 who died from H1N1. Countless lives were saved by the mass vaccination programs in Canada.</p>
<p>I applaud WHO and public health departments across the country.</p>

<p>Re: The WHO'S Biggest Mistake, Marni Soupcoff, April 15.</p>
<p>Marni Soupcoff is 100% correct that the WHO should back off its claim about the dangers of swine flu. Certainly the ancient law of human consistency prevents it from coming clean (a little like Al Gore refusing to concede his many errors on climate change). The irony is that a newspaper journalist is the one busting the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control on their Chicken Little cries when it's the media that deserves some of the blame for the hysteria.</p>
<p>For decades, newspapers have played credulous handmaiden to these health organizations, lazily reprinting their press releases to fill out a slow midwinter news day, without a lick of further investigation. Virtually every year since the 1968 epidemic, news reports have been scaring the cotton out of everyone with their Armageddon predictions of a Spanish flu sequel. Remember the avian flu? Millions died -- but all except six of them were chickens, slaughtered as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>Finally, like Ms. Soupcoff, I don't buy the conspiracy theories about Big Pharma payoffs. Because why -- to paraphrase Napoleon -- should we ascribe to malice that which can be explained by incompetence?</p>

</div><div>Richard Cuthbertson   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>433 words</div><div>15 April 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>The Alberta government is recalling more than 650,000 unused doses of adjuvanted H1N1 flu vaccine and is also seeking a refund from the pharmaceutical giant that manufactured the product.</p>
<p>The moves come after Health Canada recently slashed the original provisional expiration date on the vaccines from 18 months to just six.</p>
<p>That's left Alberta with hundreds of thousands of doses, for which it paid $2.2 million, that are now reaching a six-month shelf life and must be yanked, according to Dr. James Talbot, senior medical officer of health with Alberta Health and Wellness.</p>
<p>"It's sort of an unprecedented situation," he said in an interview Wednesday.</p>
<p>Talbot noted there are no safety issues with the vaccine, nor are there any adverse reactions associated with it. The issue, he said, is expired vaccine may not properly protect people from H1N1.</p>
<p>"To make sure that any of the stuff that's about to be beyond its shelf life isn't accidentally given to people, we're pulling it back," Talbot said.</p>
<p>Talbot said there will be discussions with federal authorities, regulators and the vaccine manufacturer, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, about "reimbursements."</p>
<p>Health Canada says that in October 2009 the vaccine was given a "provisional expiry date" of 18 months. But data no longer supports that assessment and Health Canada requested <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> revise the shelf life.</p>
<p>"We are assessing impacts of the revised expiry date including the impacts on the purchase contract," Health Canada spokeswoman Christelle Legault said in a e-mail. "Discussions with (<span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>) will continue."</p>
<p>A spokeswoman with GlaxoSmith-Kline suggested in an e-mail that, after further testing, the shelf life could be extended in the future.</p>
<p>"Much of the vaccine that may have expired in Canada was delivered early in the vaccination program and Health Canada is evaluating what still remains," Michelle Smolenaars Hunter said.</p>
<p>"Discussions are ongoing with Health Canada and it would be premature to speculate what the outcome of these discussions could be."</p>
<p>Even though roughly 650,000 adjuvanted doses are being pulled in Alberta, there are no worries about a shortage of vaccine. Currently, only a handful of people a day are getting immunized, largely for travel reasons, Talbot said.</p>
<p>The medical officer also noted the province has 120,000 doses of the non-adjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>"We have more than enough for any kind of reasonable demand over the next little while until this is resolved," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Liberals blast health executive premiums; 'It just feels like almost an orgy of payments,' MLA says</b>
</div><div>Jodie Sinnema   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>662 words</div><div>15 April 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Some top health executives are being paid rich premiums as well as hefty bonuses, generous base salaries and "gold-plated" retirement packages, the Alberta Liberals say.</p>
<p>But a top executive with Alberta Health Services said the premiums are essentially pay raises for people still under pre-existing contracts who took new jobs with increased responsibilities.</p>
<p>"If their responsibilities increased, you'd expect their salaries to increase," said Mike Conroy, executive vice-president of corporate services. He said the premiums will disappear and the amounts will be rolled into base salaries when new contracts are created.</p>
<p>Unlike Sheila Weatherill and Jack Davis, who led the former health regions in Edmonton and Calgary, new executives no longer receive supplemental executive retirement packages that don't require employee contributions, Conroy said.</p>
<p>Liberal MLA Kevin Taft remains unhappy with the high salaries and extra payments.</p>
<p>"It just feels like almost an orgy of payments to these people when you have such large salaries and then bonuses and then premiums, and then on top of that a remarkable retirement package to which they don't have to pay anything," said Taft, the Liberal health critic. "I'm really, really questioning why we have to pay health-care executives this kind of money."</p>
<p>Documents obtained through access to information legislation show five top executives received premiums ranging from $25,000 to $79,000 last year, for a total of approximately $300,000. Some of the same executives also received bonuses ranging from $19,000 to $130,000 for reaching certain performance objectives, even though those objectives were difficult to measure during Alberta Health Services' year of transition. Bonuses for eight top executives cost the system $472,000, but approximately 70 people in senior positions are eligible for bonuses.</p>
<p>"We've reduced the number of leaders by almost half," Conroy said, noting the former health regions had about 140 vice-presidents.</p>
<p>Duckett currently earns $575,000 a year plus a potential $144,000 bonus. Taft said the CEO and other health executives should be paid at the same rate as deputy ministers: between $300,000 and $400,000.</p>
<p>"There are plenty of very committed, very qualified and experienced people prepared to run our system at the salary of a deputy minister," Taft said. "What salary does Stephen Duckett make? Double the salary of the premier. Well, Ed Stelmach takes a lot of heat. He has a lot of responsibility."</p>
<p>Health Minister Gene Zwozdesky said he hadn't heard of the premiums. He said they will be part of a review to be done by Alberta Health Services on contracts in general.</p>
<p>"I'm always concerned about things that continue to surprise you, sometimes from the past such as this one," Zwozdesky said. "We have to look at what the circumstances of that day were and if they were contractual obligations; we are obviously obliged to make good on them."</p>
<p>Taft said since contracts can't be broken, current ones with bonuses and premiums can be grandfathered in. But he said any such future deals need to be stopped.</p>
<p>"I don't think the public likes this one bit," Taft said. "If this was payment at risk, what further do these people have to do wrong to not get paid that amount?"</p>
<p>A recent survey of nurses, doctors and other staff showed lack of trust in senior leadership and low morale. The Health Quality Council of Alberta and the auditor general are both investigating the province's H1N1 vaccination rollout. The health minister also stepped in and reversed plans to close hospital beds in Edmonton and Calgary, as well as plans to move many mental health patients out of Alberta Hospital into the community.</p>
<p>"Honestly, how many problems does the health-care system have to have before these bonuses are withheld?" Taft said.</p>

<p>Admit your mistakes before others exaggerate them. That's the oft-quoted wry advice of writer and retired surgeon Dr. Andrew V. Mason. Perhaps the World Health Organization (WHO) was trying to follow it this week by convening a three-day meeting of outside experts to review the organization's handling of the recent swine flu outbreak. The problem is, despite claiming to want to know what went wrong as much as what went right, the WHO seems unwilling to even entertain the possibility that it created a counterproductive panic by labelling H1N1 a pandemic of the highest order ( "level 6").</p>
<p>Swine flu, as you've probably realized by now, has turned out to be a mild, not particularly deadly virus-- it's certainly far less deadly than the regular seasonal flu that most of us consider a mundane part of everyday life. If one were feeling charitable toward the WHO, one could point out that it didn't know back in the spring of last year -- when it shouted "level 6!" from the rooftops -- that H1N1 would prove to be such a relatively innocuous bug. But it's precisely because it didn't know that the WHO should have been more cautious with its labelling. You don't shout "fire" in a crowded theatre just because it smells like the popcorn might be a little on the burnt side. It's not worth the chaos and alarm you might cause. (Or in this case, the run on vaccines and the resorting to quacks and sketchy "home" remedies.)</p>
<p>By the time the WHO realized that swine flu was not a pandemic in the layman's sense of that word (infecting a high percentage of a population and killing a high percentage of those infected), it should have issued a mea culpa for overstating H1N1's risks. It didn't. In fact, the closest the WHO has come to conceding any mishandling of the swine flu "pandemic" are the remarks made by Keiji Fukuda, the WHO's top influenza expert, on Monday. "Confusion about phases and level of severity [in the WHO's system for declaring a pandemic] remains a very vexing issue," he said. But as late as last week Fukuda was still vigorously defending the WHO's decision to sound the ultimate alarm over swine flu: "We have never had a moment's doubt of whether this is a pandemic or not."</p>
<p>Notice the use of the present tense? The WHO still hasn't officially declared the H1N1 "pandemic" over, since it insists on sticking with a torqued definition of pandemic that pays no attention to how serious the illness is.</p>
<p>The rest of the planet is pretty clear on the matter. H1N1 is not, and never was, a pandemic. By insisting otherwise, the WHO is diminishing its own credibility, which will be dangerous when the time comes that the world really does need to turn to it for advice.</p>
<p>By not fessing up, the WHO has also now guaranteed, as Dr. Mason predicted, that others will exaggerate its errors. In fact they've already started: There are widespread uncorroborated rumours and conspiracy theories accusing the WHO of purposely ramping up the H1N1 alarm because of pressure (or even payoffs) from pharmaceutical companies (evil Big Pharma), which made large profits on all the H1N1 vaccines. I don't buy these allegations (as Michael Fumento has pointed out in these pages, the WHO has enough simple self-interested reasons of its own to want to make too much of an outbreak). However, the WHO has only itself to blame for the speculation since it didn't set the record straight about where it did err in its handling of Swine Flu.</p>
<p>Some sources (including Fumento) say that H1N1 has actually had a net positive effect on health, because it has partly displaced the more dangerous seasonal flu.</p>
<p>If that's the case, the WHO's stubborn resistance to admitting it has been wrong about the virus is even less forgivable and even more dangerous.</p>
<p>Recounting this isn't to say the WHO should be on its knees begging for forgiveness (entertaining as that might be). However, it should at least be changing its practices and, specifically, its definition of a pandemic so that it does not waste the world's time and resources by vastly over-blowing mild illnesses like swine flu in the future.</p>
<p>For better or worse, most changes are impossible until people concede they've made a mistake. The WHO has shown no indication of being ready to do that. As an organization, it might very well be securing its own irrelevance in the years to come. I'm declaring a "level 6" WHO emergency. If that still means anything to anyone.</p>

</p>
<p>In a society riddled with problems - natural disasters, wars, economical downturns - it appears that nobody is at a loss for words. Bombarded by words from the media, government and the countless gossips we encounter, it is practically impossible to comprehend everything we take in. People rarely take the time to breathe, let alone contemplate the truth behind the latest tidbit of news.</p>
<p>Misinterpretations of what we read, hear and see are unbelievably common; our society is all about the "Go! Go! Go!" mentality. Busy families and workaholics alike frantically search for the time to eat a healthy diet let alone process information that could potentially have a great impact on their lives.</p>
<p>When the H1N1 virus hit Kitchener-Waterloo, very few people had not heard of the virus and those who had longed for their days of ignorance. Vaccine or no vaccine? That was the question that we all had to face, and one that came with no clear answer. Every two minutes there was a new theory, a new explanation. How were we supposed to decide?</p>
<p>Similarly, there has been buzz for the past couple of years claiming a correlation exists between the development of autism and childhood vaccinations. With all the information available through the internet and books, parents of autistic children believe they can pinpoint the cause of their child's illness. The breadth of information is incredible and surely some of it is accurate. However, parents eager to uncover any conclusion often believe the first theory they come across.</p>
<p>It is this sloppy research that triggered a tidal wave of fearful parents simply trying to enjoy their local news. All of a sudden parents were choosing to not vaccinate their children altogether. When attempts were made by television shows like The Doctors to clear this myth, parents simply fired back that the health care system denied the claims for their own personal gain.</p>
<p>We are always warned that jumping to conclusions will never result in positive outcomes but we as society rarely heed this warning. We believe everything tabloids tell us without question, simply because we would rather dwell in the glamorous lives of the rich and famous than our own hectic realities. We only choose to cling to this tabloid-fed nonsense because we are desperately seeking excitement and glamour that is missing in our own lives. Or perhaps we're just too lazy to care either way.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, all I know is that our society has fallen into a habit of chronic laziness. We create excuses to cover up for this such as the famous, "Oh I'm so sorry. I totally forgot. Life has just been so busy, you know?"</p>
<p>And what of the lives of the people in Chile and Haiti? Weeks pass and our attention-deficit society moves on to the latest excitement until they are also deemed unworthy of our regard.</p>
<p>What does all of this mean? Where did this chronic laziness originate? Are we honestly too busy to stop and think about what is important?</p>
<p>I believe the issue is that we don't know what is important. We obsess over what we want, not what we need. It's far too easy to say that we're too busy to watch the news or read the paper and instead go to watch American Idol. We're all guilty of it.</p>
<p>I'm not saying we have to be perfect. All we can do is make the conscious choice to try. Take the few minutes in our days to listen - or read - and try to make sense of everything. Think before rushing into things, and weed the unimportant wants out of our lives. We owe it to ourselves to slow down and breathe. Perhaps we can turn things around and a time will come when understanding and listening are synonymous.</p>

<p>FXA seems to have a good product, turned themselves around, and have gotten their house in order.</p>
<p>Why isn’t the market appreciating that?</p>
<p>Al.</p>
<p>Hi Al,</p>
<p>Afexa Life Sciences Inc. by any other name is still CV Technologies, the developer and marketer of Cold -FX. The stock has been in a sell off since the fall of 2005, and even though it got a pop from the lows of the fall of 2009, those gains seem to be in the rear-view mirror.</p>
<p>The good news at FXA came in 2009, as the concerns regarding the H1N1 flu and positioning Cold-FX with the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games helped drive sales. Revenue came in at $29.5-million for Q1 2010, up 50 per cent from the year earlier period, and earnings per share were reported at $0.06 from $0.03 in 2009.</p>
<p>The three year chart tells the tale of a stock that popped and has subsequently dropped as investors decided that all the good news was baked into this cake. The chart also paints a portrait of a stock that has been selling off for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Below is a 10 year chart for FXA and as you can see it’s no oil painting!</p>
<p>The big double top at the historical highs of $4.00 were shouting for investors to get off the ride and book some profits.</p>
<p>The six month chart provides a view of the most recent action in the shares and the selling pressure that has come into the stock.</p>
<p>FXA has breached support on the 200-day moving average, and that's a caution flag. There is support at $0.50 and it could catch a bounce from there, but with volume coming in below the three-month average of 100,000 shares a day, it could be more of dream than a possibility.</p>
<p>I think that the market has the story on FXA. It's a stock that has enjoyed a nice run, but investors are not convinced that it can maintain the sales increases that are seen to be driven by one time events.</p>
<p>Happy Capitalism!</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Quinn probes into injury epidemic; Oilers coach wants to know why excessive number of games lost obliterated past franchise high by over 50 per cent</b>
</div><div>Joanne Ireland   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>1008 words</div><div>14 April 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>C2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Injuries proved to be a real sore spot for Pat Quinn, so much so that he wants some answers. His Edmonton Oilers closed out the season with a league high 531 man games lost -- a tally that obliterates the previous franchise high of 346 in 2007-08.</p>
<p>Seven players underwent surgery, only three played all 82 games (Dustin Penner, Tom Gilbert and Andrew Cogliano), and a total of 30 ended up suiting for the club at one point or another.</p>
<p>Some situations were unavoidable, some unexplainable. There were cases of H1N1, a bout of mono, colitis and the customary bruises and breaks that come from blocking shots and ramming into rink boards.</p>
<p>But why were the Oilers' numbers so high? Is it the way the players are training in the off-season? Are the circadian rhythms out of whack because of the travel schedule?</p>
<p>"The way we train in the offseason, as far as I'm concerned, is a question," said Quinn. "Because we didn't have a good base in some of the areas, like the aerobic side of it on a team basis, it started to show up in our third periods when you needed to be strong.</p>
<p>"Then you look at when we travel, what do we do when we get off the plane. How do you handle circadian rhythms to allow their bodies to (adjust) as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>"We have lots of questions with what's going on."</p>
<p>For starters Quinn wonders if it just a coincidence that the man games lost started to skyrocket when the fitness staff changed.</p>
<p>Longtime strength coach Daryl Duke was released by the club during the lockout and replaced first by Kelly Buchberger, who is now an assistant coach, then by Chad Moreau. The older brother of captain Ethan Moreau is an L.A.-based chiropractic/ biomechanic professor/ trainer who has since turned the reins over to Simon Bennett.</p>
<p>The two worked together last season.</p>
<p>During Duke's days, the worst season resulted in 216 games lost and that was in 1997-98. There were only 93 games lost in 2001-02.</p>
<p>"It's got to stop at some time. Or at least the number of guys that go down (gets reduced)," said Gilbert. "If I had the answers it would be a lot easier, but staying healthy has been a problem the last couple of years.</p>
<p>"We talk about it. It's frustrating. Some are fluke injuries. That's part of the game. Some are hard to avoid but the swine flu? Mono? I don't know what it is, we just seemed to catch everything."</p>
<p>After playing the first three games of the season, defenceman Sheldon Souray spent the next 16 reeling from a concussion. He subsequently sent himself to the operating room in February because he was seeking retribution and busted his hand in a fight with the Calgary Flames Jarome Iginla.</p>
<p>He has since stated that he was hurried back into the lineup in his first season, despite the fact his surgically repaired shoulder wasn't up to the task.</p>
<p>Teammates said Tuesday that they had never been under undue pressure to return from an injury. That's not to say there haven't been other incidents of note. In 2007, Moreau was diagnosed with a bone bruise after he had been hit with a slapshot in the pre-season. It turned out to be a broken bone.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons for the escalating numbers, they are also of concern to the players.</p>
<p>"It's not just this season but to explain it? I don't know," Shawn Horcoff said. "We're not just losing guys to little bumps and bruises. It's big injuries. Surgeries. And the things that cause that are major incidents. (Ales Hemsky) had the same surgery as me and that's the result of wear and tear, and not just in the NHL, from hitting when you're 13 years old.</p>
<p>"But it is concerning, especially when you lose a lot of your best players. It's tough to compete with a lot of man games lost."</p>
<p>After Souray went down, gritty newcomer Ryan Stone went out with a knee injury. He came back in December but by January was done for the season. He has since had surgery.</p>
<p>Goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin played just 18 games before a back injury eventually sent him to the operating room then Hemsky had his shoulder repaired.</p>
<p>"You go to any team and take away their top three players, their best forward, goalie and D-man, and it is going to be a tough year. Unfortunately it happened to us and it happened early," said Jason Strudwick. "I don't have to go through all the names, but we lost a lot of good guys."</p>
<p>"It's something we have to look at because 530 games is alarming," said Quinn, who also has some wills to break if he is going to bring about some change.</p>
<p>A firm believer in the sleep-wake cycle (in short, the circadian rhythm), he has had tried to change some of the team's travel patterns. And not always successfully.</p>
<p>"I said if we're travelling two time zones, when we get off the plane we'll have a skate or a dryland workout just to get the clock to start turning. That was based on legitimate studies," Quinn said. "Some of our guys don't like it so they (complain) to somebody about it ... We have a lot of guys running the funny farm. It's important to have an opinion but sometimes it does more to tear down, than build up."</p>

<p>Fears of drug violence spreading to beaches and colonial towns are driving away tourists and threatening Mexico's crucial tourism industry, already battered by last year's swine flu outbreak. The number of international tourists flying into the Pacific beach resort of Acapulco, where rival hit men have fought brazen gun battles in recent months, fell by almost a quarter in the first three months of this year, airport operator OMA said.</p>

<p>In 2000, Robert Reeve was a new recruit at CFB Meaford, which he joined after 12 years as a special constable with the Ontario Provincial Police. An idea for a new product came to him in a dream during his training period.</p>
<p>Eight years later, he turned that idea into a successful business, a hand sanitizer called Purmist.</p>
<p>It has been laboratory tested on 13 types of bacteria and one virus to date, including the H1N1 influenza, and it can eradicate over 99 per cent of all 14 for four hours or longer. Its plant-based natural pedigree means it doesn't cause the allergic reactions experienced by those using chemical-based sanitizers.</p>
<p>Mr. Reeve says sales of Purmist, which was picked up by Mark's Work Warehouse at the end of 2008, have grown by about 10 per cent to 15 per cent every month ever since, even during the recession. Now 980 stores across Canada are carrying the sanitizer, including branches of Metro, Jean Coutu, Overweightea, and Shoppers Drug Mart. Purmist is also used by Hockey Canada.</p>

<div>Report on Business: Canadian</div>

<div>1070 words</div><div>14 April 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>B8</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Robert Reeve was in basic training with the Canadian Armed Forces when he had a dream.</p>
<p>Mr. Reeve, now 42, is president of MKR International based in Erin, Ont., north of Toronto. The firm produces Purmist, a powerful hand sanitizing system developed from essential oils. But in 2000, he was a new recruit at CFB Meaford, after 12 years as a special constable with the Ontario Provincial Police.</p>
<p>The idea for what developed into Purmist came to him one night during his training period. Being the sort of man who kept a pad of paper and pen by the bed, he was able to write it down after waking up. “It was vivid – people were being sprayed with liquid from head to toe, there were images of flowers, brooks, cleanliness, uniforms,” he recalls. “Of course, I had to decipher what I'd written down, and what it meant to me was that I had to find something that would help the professionals protect themselves better from bacteria and germs.”</p>
<p>Wayne King, a professor of entrepreneurship at Memorial University in Newfoundland and Labrador, has worked with five Canadian Forces (CF) alumni who wanted to start small businesses as part of the school's pilot project last year called Based in Business. “When you start a small business you need a specific skill as your foundation. For the most part, the people I worked with had already accumulated the technical skills they needed to do something and build a business around it.”</p>
<p>Prof. King cited two examples. “One was trying to start a property management company based on skills he gained being involved in the military from a construction perspective. These skills, he felt, allowed him to be able to appraise and buy properties. Another had learned to be a welder while in the military and was wanting to get into wrought-iron work.”</p>
<p>He said military life also provided specific behavioural training that is useful to budding entrepreneurs. “These people are very motivated, disciplined and willing to work hard, and what is also useful is that they can respond to quick-changing atmospheres by being flexible and responsive to change,” Prof. King said. “I've worked with a lot of entrepreneurs and I find some tend to be a little unfocused sometimes, but a military background stands you in good stead.”</p>
<p>It turns out Mr. Reeve also holds a certificate in horticulture from University of Guelph. And since most successful businesses are the sum of an entrepreneur's experience and knowledge, he went back to his old horticultural notes and started research and formulations. “Did my experience in the military help? Yes, absolutely. I saw the need and the business opportunity, but I also felt that I wanted to give something back to the uniformed services. And 10 years after I finished my horticulture certificate, that information came back to help me,” he said.</p>
<p>After creating his prototype for what eventually became Purmist, Mr. Reeve paid for tests to be conducted on the formula at ATS Laboratories in Eagan, Minn., while simultaneously patenting it. Mr. Reeve says Purmist has been laboratory-tested on 13 types of bacteria and one virus to date, including H1N1 influenza, and can eradicate over 99 per cent of all 14 for four hours or longer. And its plant-based natural pedigree means it doesn't cause the allergic reactions experienced by those using chemical-based sanitizers.</p>
<p>Mr. Reeve says sales of Purmist, which was picked up by Mark's Work Wearhouse at the end of 2008, have grown by about 10 to 15 per cent every month, even during the recession. Now 980 stores across Canada are carrying the sanitizer, including Metro, Jean Coutu, Overwaitea, and Shoppers Drug Mart. Purmist is also used by Hockey Canada.</p>
<p>Currently, these stores only sell Purmist in a 7.1 ml atomizer bottle for $4.99. Mr. Reeve said later this spring the firm would be launching a $6.99 100 ml bottle, and a hands-free mister, the only product of its type, at $39.99. Since December, 2008, Purmist has sold $500,000 worth of product, Mr. Reeve said, with most of the profit being plowed back into the company.</p>
<p>This sort of determination to see a project through is not unusual in those with military training, according toForces spokesman Commander Hubert Genest in Ottawa.</p>
<p>“We provide training throughout the course of a career … The public think we in the military follow orders and we do, but people also know how to push for their own ideas … ” he said. “In the last three to five years there has been a surge of new recruits and one of the things they refer to the most is that they want to help and to make a meaningful contribution to society.”</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>Based in Business</p>
<p>A pilot project started at Memorial University in St. John's last August trains current or former Canadian Forces members in entrepreneurship. Based In Business was designed as part of the Students In Free Enterprise (SIFE) program at Memorial's business school and it is run by business students. The pilot had five participants from Atlantic Canada: two had already started businesses and the other three had ideas about what they wanted to pursue. They were taught accounting, finance, marketing, ethics, basic law, and small business loans.</p>
<p>Sarah Fisher, a 21-year-old student of commerce and accounting, currently runs Based In Business, which is being brought back in 2010. She said it was so successful the school hopes to make it a national program within two years. Ms. Fisher said Based in Business is made up of three parts:</p>
<p>• 1. Online modules to access entrepreneurial drive and previous business knowledge.</p>
<p>• 2. A week-long intensive entrepreneurial training camp, where participants are taught the business background needed to run a small business.</p>
<p>• 3. A year-long mentorship, partnering participants with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
<p>“CF members have given so much to our country. Based In Business provides SIFE Memorial with the chance to give back to them and provide them with the skills that we are learning through school to make sure they can be prepared for the next phase of their lives,” she said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Incidence of Guillain-Barré Syndrome was low with H1N1 vaccine, researchers report</b>
</div><div>CARLY WEEKS   </div>
<div>743 words</div><div>14 April 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>L4</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>For every 10 million H1N1 vaccinations administered in the U.S. last year, officials received about six reports of people developing Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder.</p>
<p>It's a low number, and one that officials had predicted they would see, considering the fact researchers know the risk of developing the syndrome following vaccination is quite low.</p>
<p>But memories of problems during a 1976 immunization campaign and public anxiety during last year's H1N1 pandemic stoked fears that mass inoculation using a new vaccine would result in a rash of serious side effects, health problems and even deaths. As a result, public health officials in Canada and around the world have been closely monitoring reports of medical problems or other adverse events associated with those who were vaccinated.</p>
<p>Now that the peak of the pandemic has passed and researchers are looking back at the response, signs indicate many of those public fears were exaggerated, or even unfounded.</p>
<p>U.S. researchers presented a study yesterday at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting, taking place in Toronto this week, that showed reports of Guillain-Barré Syndrome associated with H1N1 vaccination in the U.S. were extremely low.</p>
<p>Specifically, there were 6.2 reports of the syndrome for every 10 million H1N1 vaccinations administered last year. Meanwhile, researchers said there were 10.6 reports of GBS for every 10 million seasonal flu vaccinations given last year. The rates are low, and similar to those observed during other vaccination campaigns.</p>
<p>It's one of the first major reports on the subject to be released following the pandemic. The Public Health Agency of Canada said there have been 26 cases of GBS reported in Canada following the H1N1 vaccination campaign, which equals about one case for every million doses of vaccine distributed.</p>
<p>Guillain-Barré Syndrome is a rare disorder in which people experience sudden weakness or paralysis. The syndrome is more common in people over age 50, and most people who develop it are able to recover. Although the exact causes are somewhat murky, the Public Health Agency of Canada says strong evidence has linked it to Campylobacter jejuni, a type of food-borne bacteria. There is evidence that vaccinations are linked to a slight increase in the cases of GBS, although the reasons are unclear. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it seems the immune systems of people with GBS damage their own nerve cells. This immune system response may be activated by certain infections, and very rarely, vaccines, according to the agency.</p>
<p>There are about 600 to 700 new cases of GBS in Canada each year, says the Public Health Agency of Canada. Before last year's pandemic, about 10 to 12 million flu vaccines were distributed across Canada each year. But only 79 cases of GBS following vaccination have been recorded in Canada since 1997, which is about seven cases a year.</p>
<p>While the new report provides some reassurance of the vaccine's safety, it also raises a number of new questions. For instance, why are reports of GBS higher for the seasonal flu vaccine? How exactly are vaccines linked to Guillain-Barré Syndrome? And perhaps most important, who is most at risk of developing the rare disorder?</p>
<p>James Sejvar, a neurologist and epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters that work must be done to determine whether there is a genetic risk that makes some people susceptible to the syndrome. He also said the issue is complicated by the fact that it's difficult to know whether any cases of GBS can be linked to last year's vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>Dr. Sejvar said he couldn't speculate on why the syndrome seemed higher among those who had the seasonal vaccine. But he said the CDC is doing several large studies that are actively following people who get vaccinated in order to more accurately track the rate of side effects.</p>
<p>Nizar Souayah, assistant professor of neuromuscular disease at the New Jersey Medical School in Newark, who authored the study, said it's difficult to draw many conclusions from the research because the issue is extremely complex and is still unfolding. He said he wants to embark on a new study to track people following vaccination to determine whether they developed any side effects.</p>

<p>Brad Billingsley could have been waiting for his tee time at an Arizona golf course.</p>
<p>Instead, the former Lafayette, Calif., resident and his wife Linda were in a lagoon off Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, snapping photos of grey whales bobbing next to their small charter boat.</p>
<p>"Every day, it's an adventure here," Brad Billingsley said. "It's added 20 years to my life."</p>
<p>Brad, 62, and Linda Billingsley, 61, are among the "silver surge" of baby boomers seeking alternative retirement nests in Mexico, according to a recent report by the International Community Foundation.</p>
<p>It's not certain how many U.S. and Canadian retirees are living in Mexico -- a 2004 study puts the number between 500,000 and 600,000 -- but the foundation and other researchers say an increase is likely as more boomers settle into their golden years and find Mexico an affordable alternative. Almost half the retirees living in coastal areas are getting by comfortably on less than $1,000 per month, said the report, which cites the growth of real estate projects targeted at retirees as proof that aging North Americans are flocking south.</p>
<p>The Billingsleys had seriously considered a retirement community with a golf course in central Arizona. But they lacked the enthusiasm for fairway living that seemed to consume retirees there.</p>
<p>"Their entire lives were involved with golf," Brad Billingsley said.</p>
<p>In 2007, the couple settled into a $300,000, two-bedroom beachfront condominium in Rosarito Beach, in Baja California.</p>
<p>They've made the most of their retirement dollars, Brad Billingsley said. The cost of living -- from groceries to health care -- is low in their beachfront town and there's plenty to do, such as driving down the coast to Cabo, walking on the beach and shopping at the local mercado.</p>
<p>The couple lived in California's Bay Area for 60 years, much of it in Walnut Creek and Lafayette. Sometimes they miss their old haunts, especially bookstores, Brad Billingsley said. U.S. expatriates surveyed in the foundation's report said they return often to the U.S. The Billingsleys make a trip across the border to San Diego every few weeks. That's less of an option for Canadian retirees, many of whom divide their time between a winter home in Mexico and a summer place in Canada.</p>
<p>Affordability, quality of life and weather were top reasons retirees chose Mexico, according to the foundation report, which surveyed 842 expatriates about their experiences.</p>
<p>"After the market crash of 2008, we wanted to better understand what was going on with retirees in Mexico," said Richard Kiy, president and chief executive officer of the foundation, a Southern California-based nonprofit that works to increase charitable giving and volunteerism across U.S. borders. In an 88-question survey of retirees 50 and older, the foundation found that expatriates had weathered the economic storm well.</p>
<p>The foundation's 17-page report, released in March, deals with demographics and day-to-day basics such as public safety concerns and household expenses of retirees in Mexico's coastal areas such as Cancun, Rosarito Beach, Rocky Point and Puerto. Four follow-up studies over the next few months will tackle topics that include the impact on Mexico's environment, health care accessibility, real estate and civic involvement by foreign retirees.</p>
<p>A weaker economy at home, travel alerts and worries about the H1N1 virus have hurt tourist travel numbers to Mexico over the past year, but the country still remains an attractive haven for retirees, said Anne McEnany, co-author of the foundation's report and the foundation's senior adviser for environment and conservation.</p>
<p>Reports of narcotics-related violence, especially in border cities such as Tijuana and Nogales, gave many retirees the jitters, McEnany said. But that anxiety fades away after they've settled into their new homes, she said.</p>
<p>"I'm really saddened to see coverage of [Mexican] crime in the media," said Doug Gray, 60, a retired fire captain.</p>
<p>He and his wife Cyndi recently purchased a condominium in Manzanillo, a port city between Puerto Vallarta and Acapulco. They say they feel as safe -- if not safer -- walking around the mercados and boulevards as they did in Livermore, their California hometown.</p>
<p>"We really love the pace," Cyndi Gray said. "It's a slower pace and you can sit down there and get into the groove. I can unplug."</p>
<p>The Grays have yet to live there full-time; Cyndi, 48, is still working.</p>
<p>Ellen Fields, another expat from California, lives in Merida, on the Yucatan Peninsula. A self-described "dot-bomb refugee," Fields and her husband James run Yucatanliving.com, a Web site for expatriates. They moved to Merida from San Luis Obispo in 2002.</p>
<p>Ellen Fields says she's enchanted by the Old World atmosphere of the markets and customs. "It's a very gracious culture," she said. "You walk down the street here and people say hello."</p>

Canadians and Americans making Mexico their retirement home. The
weather and the economy are two of the top reasons for the move.   </p>

<p>Re: H1N1 Communication Poor, WHO Admits, April 13.</p>
<p>Nice to see the World Health Organization (WHO) finally taking some blame for last year's swine-flu fiasco, but we still don't hear it apologizing for having redefined the very concept of a pandemic. Up until a year ago, the official definition required "simultaneous epidemics worldwide with enormous numbers of deaths and illnesses." In the last century anything considered a pandemic killed at least a million people--contrast that with the 14,000 or so who died, worldwide, from last year's H1N1 "pandemic."</p>
<p>But once the WHO had labelled it a pandemic, legitimately or otherwise, government departments and the public at large were panicked into responding in ways which, in the end, had no legitimate basis. The UN strikes again.</p>

</p>
<p>The World Health Organization acknowledged Monday it did a poor job of communicating the uncertainties about the H1N1 virus, which then caused confusion among the public.</p>
<p>"The reality is there is a huge amount of uncertainty (in a pandemic). I think we did not convey the uncertainty. That was interpreted by many as a non-transparent process," Keiji Fukuda, WHO's leading pandemic expert said.</p>
<p>When the H1N1 virus emerged almost one year ago it was a strain that had never been seen before, and as a result, scientists were left with little to go on in terms of predicting how the virus would behave. They knew it was spreading quickly around the globe but couldn't say how deadly or virulent it would become.</p>
<p>With so many unanswered questions about H1N1 in the early days of the pandemic, the void of information led to fear and confusion and health agencies in Canada and around the world struggled to meet the public's demand for answers.</p>
<p>"Populations around the world have very high expectations for immediate information," Fukuda said. "In many ways it is unforgiving out there."</p>
<p>Fukuda was addressing a three-day meeting of flu experts from around the world at WHO's headquarters in Geneva. The committee, which includes two Canadians, is reviewing the global response to the H1N1 pandemic and identifying areas that could be improved.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer, and Dr. Anthony Evans from the International Civil Aviation Organization, are participating in the meeting.</p>
<p>"We want to know what worked well. We want to know what went wrong and, ideally, why. We want to know what can be done better and, ideally, how," Dr. Margaret Chan, head of WHO, said in her opening remarks to the group. She said she wants to see a "frank, critical, transparent, credible and independent" review of the UN agency's performance.</p>
<p>It faced many criticisms throughout the pandemic, s including that it purposely caused panic and that it was influenced by the pharmaceutical industry that sold millions of doses of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>A herd of sick pigs was nothing to sneeze at for public-health officials.</p>
<p>The federal government realized that how it handled a herd of pigs that caught swine flu could set a precedent in Canada and elsewhere, a new document shows.</p>
<p>An outbreak of H1N1 on an Alberta farm last spring was the first-ever report of the new virus in pigs, and the source of the infection remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Government officials were keenly aware others would be watching them closely to see how they handled the ailing herd.</p>
<p>"Canada is in the unenviable position of having to decide on how to manage the pigs on this farm," a public-health official wrote to colleagues last May.</p>
<p>"Action taken could set a precedent, at least in the short-term, on how these issues are managed in Canada, and perhaps in other countries as this situation evolves."</p>
<p>The Canadian Press obtained the May 5 email and other documents under the Access to Information Act.</p>
<p>The email shows officials were weighing three options: culling the entire herd, controlled marketing and lifting the quarantine on the pigs.</p>
<p>Canadian officials also sought advice from three international bodies over the pig problem.</p>
<p>At one point, Canada's food-safety watchdog even considered sticking pigs with a special swine-flu needle to stop the virus from spreading through herds.</p>
<p>Those plans were later dropped when health officials found pigs weren't making people sick.</p>
<p>Pigs can catch flu viruses from infected pigs and people, mostly from coughing and sneezing.</p>
<p>But there's no proof people can get the H1N1 virus from pigs or by eating pork.</p>
<p>Still, nobody wanted to buy the Alberta farmer's pigs, so he ended up culling the herd of 3,000 hogs.</p>
<p>Dr. Christopher Olsen, a swine-flu expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the government didn't know what it had on its hands last spring.</p>
<p>"It's quite easy to look back in retrospect," he said.</p>
<p>"Now it's been quite widely recognized that this virus has infected pigs in many areas. So, looking back, it was not at all a unique circumstance for Canada.</p>
<p>"But at the time, nobody knew that. Nobody knew that this perhaps was not going to be one of a small number."</p>
<p>Olsen added that other countries would have been watching Canada "quite closely" at the time.</p>
<p>"The livestock industry in the world today is quite a highly-integrated industry, and to a large degree it's based around international trade," he said.</p>
<p>"So what happens in one country can have very fundamental impacts on other countries and other jurisdictions."</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq's office wasn't immediately available for comment.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>A panel of external experts begins the task of critiquing how the World Health Organization and the international community responded to the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>The WHO, which was drawing members of the review committee from a list of experts nominated by countries, has insisted on keeping the roster secret until the work begins. Among the 29 committee members is Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health. King, who took over the Ontario job last spring, was for years Canada's point person for pandemic planning at the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>The committee, which is expected to complete its work over the course of the next 13 months, is being asked to identify what went right and what went wrong in the pandemic response so public health officials at the WHO and elsewhere can apply the lessons to future pandemic planning.</p>
<p>The WHO may have no doubts, but a chorus of critics -- especially in Europe -- has been highly critical about the decision to declare the outbreak a pandemic. They suggest the virus was no more serious than seasonal flu.</p>

</p>
<p>Spectator reporter Denise Davy has won a Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario award for her series on the crisis in children's mental health services in Canada.</p>
<p>Davy's seven-part series last year, written on a $30,000 fellowship from the Michener-Deacon Foundation, showed Canada is failing its young people when it comes to mental health. Services are inconsistent and difficult to manoeuvre through and timely help is almost impossible to find.</p>
<p>Davy travelled across Canada to probe the national situation. One in five Canadian children suffers a mental health problem.</p>
<p>"I'm thrilled to win this award because it helps raise awareness around the issue of children's mental health," said Davy. "This is such an important issue that literally effects thousands of children and yet it's almost completely ignored by governments."</p>
<p>Other winners include The Spectator's sister Torstar Corp.'s Metroland West Media Group community newspaper, the Oakville Beaver, for Angela Blackburn's report on waiting for a nursing home spot and Tina Depko's article on an H1N1 vaccine clinic.</p>

<p>An RCMP officer has been charged with careless use of a firearm and assault with a weapon after a stolen police car was fired at in November. The Mounties say two officers from the Sheshatshui detachment responded to a disturbance. When a suspect fled in a cruiser, police gave chase, ordered the suspect out of the stolen vehicle and then fired at the car.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccine shelf life shortened</b>

<p>Health Canada has shortened the shelf life of adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine, which means the majority of Saskatchewan's 470,000 unused doses of that vaccine will expire next week.</p>
<p>"Then a number of doses expire in May," said Dr. Moira McKinnon, Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer. "We're just sorting out how we will use them."</p>
<p>Late Thursday night, McKinnon heard that Health Canada, in consultation with the manufacturer <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, moved up the expiry date of the country's adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine. The revision isn't safety-related, but due to a decline in strength of the H1N1 antigen in specific lots.</p>
<p>"The antigen has destabilized much more quickly than they expected, so it isn't in a sufficient enough quantity to give an immune response," McKinnon said.</p>
<p>In October, the agency gave the vaccine an 18-month expiry date based on the information available at the time.</p>
<p>However, subsequent potency testing carried out by Health Canada and the manufacturer revealed some lots of the vaccine are losing potency so it was decided the expiry date for unused lots of the adjuvanted vaccine should be shortened to six months.</p>
<p>The revision applies only to vaccine with adjuvant, a compound that boosts the impact of the vaccine. The expiry date for Canada's unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine remains at 18 months.</p>
<p>An advisory posted on Health Canada's website assures that "Canadians can be confident that all vaccinations performed to date using (the adjuvanted vaccine) have provided them with a sufficient immune response against H1N1 infection."</p>
<p>Ordinarily, the province would pay 40 per cent of the vaccine and the federal government would cover the balance. However, it has not yet been decided if the manufacturer will take back the vaccine, if it will be destroyed locally or, since it is a safe vaccine, if doses will be combined to reach the necessary antigen potency.</p>
<p>"The vaccine company is looking at solutions like that because there are countries around the world who would like to take all that (vaccine)," McKinnon said.</p>
<p>In Canada, flu season usually runs from November to April.</p>
<p>Since the H1N1 virus dominated the flu season, Saskatchewan reported only one lab-confirmed case of seasonal flu as compared to the usual 400 to 1,000 lab-confirmed cases.</p>
<p>"We virtually haven't had any seasonal influenza," McKinnon said.</p>
<p>She attributed the low incidence of flu to a number of factors including residents practising frequent hand-washing and proper cough etiquette.</p>
<p>"Because the vaccine had an adjuvant, which gives the body a stronger immune response, it is actually giving some cross protection for the seasonal flu as well," McKinnon said.</p>
<p>The first wave of H1N1 occurred between April 2009 and June. The second wave began in October and ended in December.</p>
<p>"I really think a third wave is unlikely with Canada having vaccinated about half of its population," McKinnon said. "When we approach next winter, the H1N1 will be included in the new vaccine for seasonal influenza."</p>
<p>While the risk to get H1N1 is low in Canada, travellers planning a trip to countries in the southern hemisphere should consider getting the shot, McKinnon said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Play catch-up with Mexico; Often considered NAFTA's weakest link, the emerging market is coming on strong</b>

<div>Financial Post</div>

</p>
<p>April is turning into another impressive month for North America's hottest market ... Mexico.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Mexican Bolsa index, the country's top equity benchmark, hit a new high, only to soar even higher yesterday. The Mexican peso, meanwhile, reached its highest level since early October 2008 yesterday and remains the top-performing currency among emerging markets this year.</p>
<p>But that's not all. The month started with <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., saying the country's bonds are eligible to be included in its world government bond index, making it the first Latin American country in the closely watched index.</p>
<p>Not even Canada and its parity-busting loonie can top that kind of economic momentum. With the U.S. recovery only now starting to find its groove, there seems little doubt among analysts that Mexico will continue to move in the right direction, despite the violence that regularly grabs international headlines.</p>
<p>"Mexico has become an interesting place again for investors and we are confident there is more money to be made in this market," said Claudia Medina, a senior analyst with <span class="companylink">Banco Itau S.A</span>., an asset management firm based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p>
<p>Last year at this time, investor sentiment toward Mexico could not have been more different.</p>
<p>Like most other countries around the world, its economic growth suffered greatly from the collapse in trade and the global financial crisis, falling 6.4% in 2009. However, Mexico's economic troubles also lasted much longer than its Latin American peers. While Brazil's economy was bottoming in the second quarter of last year, Mexico's huge dependence on a still-fragile U.S. consumer, an escalating drug war and the swine flu outbreak continued to weigh heavily.</p>
<p>Then in the latter half of 2009, Both <span class="companylink">Standard & Poor's</span> and Fitch Ratings downgraded their credit ratings for Mexico's foreign currency debt following congressional elections that failed to produce meaningful fiscal reform.</p>
<p>"The year 2009 seemed to confirm all the fears put forward by the bearish camp," said Pierre Fournier, a geopolticial strategist at National Bank.</p>
<p>Today, Mexico's economy is expected to grow roughly 4% in 2010, representing a trough-to-peak increase of 10% in just one year. The only other country expected to grow that quickly is Turkey.</p>
<p>Nick Chamie, global head of emerging markets research at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span> in Toronto, said the problems that slowed the recovery last year have largely come to pass, leaving Mexico free to play an effective game of catch-up through the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>"The economy has certainly rebounded nicely following last year's disastrous results," Mr. Chamie said.</p>
<p>The strong recovery is being led primarily by Mexico's manufacturing sector as it benefits from the improving U.S. economy.</p>
<p>The U.S. market represents 80% of Mexico's total exports, which accounts for 27% of the country's gross domestic product.</p>
<p>As a large exporter of oil and home to a burgeoning mining industry, Mexico has also gained from the increase in commodity prices over the past six months to a year.</p>
<p>Another advantage is the country's strong fiscal situation. Despite the political noise about fiscal reform late last year, Mexico's government debt-to-GDP ratio hovers in a very acceptable range of 35% to 40%.</p>
<p>"That leaves it in very good stead in comparison to almost any other major economy," Mr Chamie said.</p>
<p>With a good chance that Mexican markets will pull back following such a strong run in a very short period of time, Mr. Chamie is predicting a more modest pace in gains over the next year. Over the next few months, he believes Mexico will remain attractive assuming growth remains positive and economic fundamentals continue to shine through.</p>
<p>Specifically, he sees good value in the country's fixed-income market and recommends investors take an overweight position in Mexican bonds.</p>
<p>The peso, which remains almost 25% below its 2008 high, also looks relatively cheap compared with its Latin American peers, he said.</p>
<p>How markets in Mexico will perform six months to a year from now will depend largely on U.S. growth and the trajectory of commodity prices, Mr. Chamie said.</p>
<p>Less of a concern is the country's protracted drug wars, which have destabilized the northern region of the country.</p>
<p>"To the extent that everyone is aware of the drug wars it is already priced into markets and is not a huge barrier to investing," he said.</p>
<p>As for the country's stock market, Vincent Delisle, a strategist at Scotia Capital Markets, said there also appears to be more upside in store. He told clients this week that corporate earnings in Mexico will jump 23% in 2010 and 16% in 2011.</p>
<p>By comparison, he forecasted Canadian earnings to rise 29% for 2010 and 10% the following year.</p>
<p>Already up more than 90% since the March lows last year, Mr. Delisle has a Bolsa target of 36,250, a 7% increase from yesterday's closing price of 33,840.85.</p>
<p>Reiterating a North American preference in his asset allocation, the strategist recommended U.S. stocks over Europe, Canada over Australia and Mexico over Brazil.</p>
<p>Ms. Medina's firm, which manages the Excel <span class="companylink">Latin American Fund</span> in Canada, is currently 5% overweight Mexican stocks, favouring the industrials and materials sector over consumer and telecommunications stocks.</p>
<p>"We continue to believe that growth in the Mexican economy will come more from manufacturing exports than from domestic consumption, and hence our strong position in industrial companies with high exposure to the United States and Brazil," she said.</p>
<p>Her top picks include steel company, <span class="companylink">Ternium S.A</span>., a major supplier to the U.S. automotive industry with operations in Mexico and Argentina, and <span class="companylink">Alfa S.A</span>. B de C.V., an industrial conglomerate that produces high-tech aluminum auto parts.</p>
<p>The firm boasts significant holdings in petrochemical company <span class="companylink">Mexichem</span> S.A. B de C.V., and <span class="companylink">Grupo Mexico S.A</span>. B de C.V., the country's largest mining company.</p>
<p>Investors can buy ADRs of <span class="companylink">Ternium</span> and <span class="companylink">Mexichem</span> in New York. Or, for broader exposure to the Mexican market, iShares offers the MSCI Mexico Investable Market ETF, priced in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there are several Latin American ETFs and mutual funds.</p>
<p>With new consumption taxes taking hold in January, Ms. Medina said Mexico's beleaguered consumer will remain stressed over the short term, but she believes that, eventually, success in the manufacturing sector will lead to better domestic consumption.</p>
<p>While Mexico surely faces serious challenges ahead, including an economy too dependent on the U.S. consumer and a political environment that has been dogged by ineffective government and corruption too often in the past, Mr. Fournier said those risks, on balance, are outweighed by Mexico's positive long-term fundamentals.</p>
<p>With an increasingly competitive manufacturing sector, a strong resource base and superior corporate growth prospects, he expects Mexican stocks to outperform U.S. indexes over the long term.</p>
<p>"Sentiment about Mexico is clearly and finally beginning to turn," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sports events give city much-needed economic boost</b>
</div><div>Tamara Gignac   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>560 words</div><div>9 April 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>In a year where the recession took a bite out of tourism dollars in most major Canadian cities, curling and football provided a much-needed boost to Calgary's economy.</p>
<p>Tourism Calgary estimates that some 2.7 million visitors spent close to a billion dollars in the city in 2009, only a slight improvement over the previous year.</p>
<p>But in the middle of a recession, that's good news, says CEO Randy Williams.</p>
<p>Hotels, restaurants and attractions across Canada have struggled to overcome a slump in tourism. The global economic crisis, fears of H1N1 flu, a rising Canadian dollar and new passport rules for Americans have led many to scrap travel entirely.</p>
<p>Businesses have also tightened their belt and expense accounts, leading to a decline in corporate visitors.</p>
<p>But a handful of big games helped cushion what might otherwise have been a very difficult year for the city's tourism industry.</p>
<p>"If we needed a year where we brought in major events, it was 2009," said Williams, speaking after Tourism Calgary's annual meeting Thursday.</p>
<p>The Grey Cup festival alone delivered some $61 in economic benefits to the city, as 121,000 people spent money on hotels, liquor, meals, souvenirs and entertainment.</p>
<p>The four-day football party, along with the Brier, WorldSkills, the Viterra Ironman and a world water ski championship, brought a much-needed influx of visitors to Calgary, Banff and Lake Louise in 2009 -- the same year travellers from Europe and Asia slipped by an estimated 10 per cent.</p>
<p>Tourism Calgary isn't relying only on parties and conventions to fill rooms and eateries this year, though. The city's strategic marketing agency -- revamped with a new board, chairman and CEO -- said it is taking a more collaborative approach with local hotels, restaurant owners and attractions to come up with new ways to revitalize and draw people to the region.</p>
<p>"I don't care if people come from Didsbury or Denmark or Seattle or Shanghai -- I just want to see more people come to our city," said chairman George Brookman.</p>
<p>"Our task is to take little events that happen every day and every month and turn them into experiences."</p>
<p>Tour operators are often among the first to feel the pinch in a recession. But there are promising signs the industry is in recovery: According to recent figures from the Hotel Association of Canada, some 78 per cent of leisure tourists are expected to travel as much or more than they usually do in 2010.</p>
<p>But that also means competing with U.S. destinations for dollars, as a surging Loonie means prices for southern vacations are suddenly an appealing -- and cheap -- option for Canadians.</p>
<p>But Williams isn't convinced a higher dollar will have a major impact on this year's local tourism industry, especially when it comes to the lucrative business market.</p>
<p>"The way the dollar is today doesn't really influence a meeting planner who might be looking at Calgary three years from now," he said.</p>
<p>"The market most sensitive to currency change is the leisure pleasure traveller, because they are price sensitive anyway and have the shortest lead time for booking. They will be the ones looking at the dollar."</p>

</p>
<p>Eight months after Chloe Papparis began taking a birth control pill for acne, she almost died from severe side-effects, she says.</p>
<p>The teen started suffering from a bad migraine headache and frequent bouts of vomiting last August. Her family doctor thought it might be swine flu.</p>
<p>Six days later, however, Papparis was rushed to Foothills Hospital. Doctors told her she was 24 hours from dying.</p>
<p>"When I was in ER, the doctor by fluke said to give me a CT scan. They found five blood clots on my brain," Papparis, now 18, said Thursday.</p>
<p>"I was told I had had a stroke and I wasn't supposed to be living. If we had waited . . . I would have died."</p>
<p>Papparis is among 800 Canadians taking part in class-action lawsuits against the manufacturer of two birth control drugs, Yaz and Yasmin, which they allege have caused severe reactions, including seven deaths.</p>
<p>All of the claims have been filed by Tony Merchant of the Merchant Law Group.</p>
<p>Fifty-four of the 90 Alberta plaintiffs in the $15-million lawsuit are from this city. That suit was filed at the Court of Queen's Bench in Calgary.</p>
<p>None of their allegations have been proven in court, and the defendants, all subsidiaries of manufacturer <span class="companylink">Bayer Inc</span>., have yet to file statements of defence.</p>
<p>Merchant said Thursday his firm has filed or is about to file similar multimillion-dollar claims in all provinces except Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p>"The seven deaths are all similar in that they were all young women who were healthy," Merchant said.</p>
<p>"One woman who died was 28, the rest were 14 to 19 years."</p>
<p>"Of the 400 who do have problems, many have lost their gall bladder. All of them have continual blood pressure problems or blood clots related to blood pressure effects," said Merchant.</p>
<p>In the claim, it is alleged the Bayer companies "participated in the common purpose of concealing the adverse effects of Yasmin and Yaz from regulatory authorities, the medical community, the public and class (action) members."</p>
<p>It also alleges the FDA in the U.S. received more than 50 reports of deaths among users of the two drugs between 2004 and 2008.</p>
<p>"These reports include deaths associated with cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, intracardiac thrombus, pulmonary embolism, and stroke in women in their child-bearing years," says the statement of claim.</p>
<p>It alleges the defendants knew or should have known that use of Yaz and Yasmin created an increased risk to consumers of personal serious injury, including but not limited to gallbladder disease, blood clots and strokes.</p>
<p>Papparis, meanwhile, spent six days in hospital and was placed on the anti-coagulant Heparin for six months to prevent clotting.</p>
<p>She is now off the drug but can never take birth control pills again. Doctors will have to be careful with her if she ever goes through surgery, for fear of more blood clotting.</p>
<p>Despina Papparis says her daughter was the first person to be admitted to the stroke clinic at Foothills Hospital because of reactions to Yaz, Yasmin and Ocella -- all birth control pills with synthetic estrogen -- but there have been several more since then.</p>
<p>"It was scary, it was horrifying, we've had nightmares," she said.</p>
<p>"She started in December (2008), because she was graduating in May. She was taking it to clear up her acne for grad and her grad photos. The doctor handed it over and we didn't think anything of it.</p>
<p>"We were lucky the doctor ordered the CT scan. He said had I not brought her in, she wouldn't have survived Saturday. It was sheer luck. Why would I expect blood clots?"</p>
<p>Chloe said she doesn't want anyone else to suffer.</p>
<p>"What happened to me is the worst thing of my life," she said. "I don't want other girls to go through it, too."</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>A set of controversial studies that suggested getting a previous seasonal flu shot doubled a person's risk of catching pandemic H1N1 last spring has finally been published -- though the mystery of whether the finding is real remains.</p>
<p>Provinces and territories scrambled to rethink their flu shot programs last fall when word of the then-unpublished findings spread like wildfire through Canadian research and public health communities.</p>
<p>Most decided to delay their seasonal flu vaccine programs until distribution of pandemic vaccine was completed.</p>
<p>But outside of Canada, where the effect wasn't seen, scientists scratched their heads and dismissed the inexplicable and troubling findings as "the Canadian problem."</p>
<p>Publication of the research in a top flight journal -- PLoS Medicine -- may make some skeptics consider whether they should revise their thinking.</p>
<p>But the fact remains research elsewhere so far doesn't corroborate these findings.</p>
<p>And there isn't an easy way to explain why getting vaccinated against seasonal flu would make a person more susceptible to catching the new flu virus.</p>
<p>"I do think that they did the best they could with the data they had," said Dr. Mark Loeb, an infectious diseases expert at McMaster University.</p>
<p>Loeb was not involved in the study and has been a skeptic about the findings.</p>

<p>Eric Tunney was a funny man from Canada who came close to making it in television in Hollywood. But he never did. For while it looked as if he was on the fast track to become a Conan O'Brien-type success story.</p>
<p>The stand-up comic from Windsor, who died in an accident at his home on March 28 at 45, could contort his face into an Elvis look-alike or play the straight man for Ed the Sock. He was a success in comedy clubs before he finished high school and soon proved he could mix the light banter, comedy and cheeky interviewing technique that is the shtick of the talk show host.</p>
<p>The aim of most stand-up comedians is to graduate from the live stage to television: Letterman, Leno, Carson and O'Brien were all stand-up before they sat behind a desk on late night TV. When Tunney moved to Los Angeles 13 years ago, he already had years of experience in comedy clubs from Florida to Toronto and successful runs on television in Canada. Almost right away he landed a job co-hosting a national talk show with former NFL star Terry Bradshaw. But the show lasted only a couple of months.</p>
<p>He signed a deal to host a program on an American cable network. But all of sudden there was a management change at the network and the show was cancelled. It happened one time after another.</p>
<p>“He used to tell his friends he didn't want to bore them with the stories of how close he came,” said Kelly Hoppe, a Windsor musician who knew Tunney well.</p>
<p>Eric Tunney was born in Toronto on Sept. 9, 1964, and moved with his family to Windsor when he was a boy. He went to F.J. Brennan, a Catholic high school. “Everybody liked him. Eric was the class clown. He was always doing something to startle a nun,” said a friend.</p>
<p>When he was only 14 he wandered into the Komedy Korner, a club in Windsor. He wasn't old enough to be in there legally but soon he was working there.</p>
<p>“He started working the spotlight for some of the acts, people like Jim Carrey who used to come through here in the 1980s,” said Leo Dufour, who owns the club.</p>
<p>From there Tunney talked his way onto the stage and started doing stand-up when he was just 15. Soon he was working not just in Windsor but also in comedy clubs in Detroit, Ann Arbor, Lansing and other car towns.</p>
<p>He would make references to his hometown and its large francophone population: “Where else do you get names like Debbie Dumouchelle?”</p>
<p>The startup comic has no writers, so Tunney wrote his own stuff. He then polished and practised it until it was good enough to present to a live audience.</p>
<p>“He was a natural comedian. Great delivery, timing and a real presence on stage,” said Dufour. “He took comedy seriously.”</p>
<p>Tunney dropped out of high school a couple of months before he graduated because his agent found him a tour of U.S. comedy clubs that started in the south. He soon moved to Toronto and became a hit at comedy clubs. That was when he started performing with Steve Kerzner and Ed the Sock in a cult hit on CITY TV.</p>
<p>He did a pilot for a talk show with the CBC. He was sure he got the job, but it was a sign of what was to come in Hollywood, when someone upstairs cancelled the program.</p>
<p>“He was terrific. He did mock interviews, you'd think he'd been doing it for 10 years,” said Hoppe, one of the musicians who worked on the pilot. “He could ad lib and wisecrack, but his style was to be a more serious interviewer like Jack Parr or Dick Cavett. He did a spectacular interview with film producer John Frankenheimer when filling in for Bob Costas in a show that followed Letterman.”</p>
<p>In some ways Tunney lived the life of his on-stage persona. He drove a Cadillac from 1964, the year he was born. He dressed like a character from Mad Men in classic suits. He loved to smoke a large cigar and wave around a glass of whisky in his stand-up routines.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago he moved back to Windsor. He worked for a while as a telemarketer, but still did comedy. One of his last routines was done in a church basement around the time of the H1N1 scare.</p>
<p>“Coming in here tonight first you see the holy water and then there's the Purell. Oh ye of little faith. If you're Catholic shouldn't the holy water be enough?”</p>
<p>But in spite of being funny, he was depressed. He never got over not making it to the big time.</p>
<p>“He was so bent on being the next Letterman that his inability to achieve that paralyzed him,” Hoppe said. “In the end he didn't have as sunny an outlook as you might have thought from a man who made so many people laugh.”</p>
<p>An only child, he leaves his parents Gerry and Renate.</p>

<p>It is useful, in the abstract at least, for the national accreditation body of health centres to encourage public release of its reports on how health care facilities stack up against national standards to ensure good, safe care is delivered. But the truncated report Accreditation Canada prepared for the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority will only confuse and mislead the average Joe about what it found when it visited the region in late 2008.</p>
<p>The final report on WRHA's compliance with best health care practices -- 22 different sites in the region were visited, from community centres to hospitals -- says the authority is accredited, but conditionally. The report itself contains numerous areas where assessors found the WRHA failed to meet best practices that Canadian health centres and organizations are measured against.</p>
<p>It is troubling that, measured against rigorous standards, the province's largest health authority did not measure up and has been given conditional accreditation. WRHA officials note that there are areas where work is to be done. But the report alone provides a skewed perspective of what Accreditation Canada found. It takes just one site, such as the pharmacy at the Victoria General Hospital, to mark the authority as having not met best practice. Further, a reader would conclude that WRHA entirely failed all standards for infection prevention and control measures, when in fact the report listed only 11 of the 102 policies and practices assessed at the 22 sites.</p>
<p>Further, the health authority is disputing a number of the findings of Accreditation Canada. Some, it says, were incorrectly assessed or quickly improved but in the six-month period the health authority is given to respond to the findings, program managers were busy with the H1N1 crisis (spring of 2009) and chose not to respond to the assessors' request for more information. The health authority believes, having now provided that detail, Accreditation Canada will amend its accreditation report accordingly.</p>
<p>The review, a routine process, did find weaknesses, hence the value of the external assessment with its exacting checklist of dos and don'ts. In its current form, however, most lay readers would be hard pressed to know precisely what they should take from the report. There is work to be done by the WRHA, but Accredition Canada's task is to make its work immediately useful to ordinary Canadians who would benefit from the oversight of an outside expert on good health practices.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canada was ready to teach Health 101; Ottawa planned to offer advice to Americans facing bitter debate</b>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The Canadian government believes it could teach Americans something about health care and once planned to offer the U.S. secretary of health expert advice as her country aimed to reform its system.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his government came under fire from critics last summer for staying out of the raging debate below the border that saw angry Americans crowd town halls armed with myths about the Canadian health-care system.</p>
<p>Even U.S. President Barack Obama acknowledged the reputation of Canadian health care was taking a hit, although he stayed silent on its pros and cons, whereas Harper kept explaining health was a provincial jurisdiction.</p>
<p>"I don't find Canadians particularly scary, but I guess some of the opponents of reform think that they make a good bogeyman," Obama said last August.</p>
<p>Documents obtained by the Star through the Access to Information Act show Ottawa had several months earlier planned to offer the U.S. administration an education about Canadian health care as Americans embarked on the journey that culminated last month in the passing of legislation to overhaul the U.S. system.</p>
<p>"As the U.S. begins its health-care reform process, please be aware that if you're interested in any aspect of the Canadian health-care system, I would be happy to arrange for experts to meet and exchange information," said a draft version of talking points prepared for federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq ahead of her first bilateral meeting with U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius last May.</p>
<p>The two women met at the World Health Assembly in Geneva last May.</p>
<p>The outbreak of swine flu dominated the conference, but a briefing memo said an objective for the chat on the Canadian side was "to learn about American priorities for health-care reform and how those reforms may impact Canada."</p>
<p>Opposition critics expressed pleasure the Conservatives had intended to clear up misinformation, but questioned why this desire was not made public.</p>
<p>"When the town hall meetings were going terribly and Canada's system was being maligned, it was our government's job to stick up for it then, to right some of the misinformation ... and they did nothing," said MP Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's), the Liberal health critic.</p>
<p>"It's nice to know that there was the possibility that we might have shared something about our health-care system, or the positive benefits of it with the Americans, and I just don't know why it is hidden under a bushel," Judy Wasylycia-Leis, NDP health critic, said Wednesday.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the issue was discussed at all. An official with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said health care did not come up as far as anyone can remember, while a spokeswoman for Aglukkaq said only that there was "a high-level discussion about matters of mutual interest."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Universal flu vaccine program cost-effective, study finds; Ontario offers free shots to everyone</b>
</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>604 words</div><div>7 April 2010</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>When Ontario started offering free flu shots to its entire population instead of only to targeted groups, it made a cost-effective decision that saves lives, a new study concludes.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Toronto conducted an extensive cost-analysis of the universal seasonal flu vaccination program, introduced in 2000, and compared the numbers with the cost and success of the targeted program, had it been continued.</p>
<p>"The main conclusion is that it is cost-effective," said the study's lead researcher, Beate Sander. "It doesn't mean it's necessarily cost-saving, but it provides very good value for money," she said of the universal program.</p>
<p>Most provinces and territories offer free seasonal flu vaccinations to senior citizens, people with chronic conditions that put them at higher risk of suffering serious complications if they contract influenza, and to health-care workers. Ontario is the only jurisdiction to offer free flu shots to everyone, at about twice the cost of offering only a targeted program, and this is the first major study to evaluate whether it's worth the price tag.</p>
<p>Sander said that the $40 million spent on the universal seasonal flu shot campaign is "very, very good value for money."</p>
<p>The widespread flu shot campaign drove up vaccination rates in Ontario from only 18 per cent of the population in 1996 to 42 per cent in 2005.</p>
<p>Analyzing data on influenza-related deaths, hospitalizations, and visits to emergency rooms and doctors' offices between 1997 and 2004, the study found that flu-related events in the overall population dropped 40 to 60 per cent more in Ontario than in three other provinces studied (Quebec, Alberta and Manitoba).</p>
<p>Specifically, the researchers determined that more than 34,000 flu cases were prevented, 111 deaths were avoided, about 780 hospitalizations and 7,745 emergency room visits were prevented, and 30,000 fewer Ontarians visited a doctor for flu symptoms.</p>
<p>Sander said it's possible something else happened to drive down the numbers over the years studied, but that the study controlled for many factors and she believes the universal vaccination program had a "true effect" on the reduced rates of illness and death.</p>
<p>Preventing thousands of people from getting sick and needing health care translated into savings of $7.8 million per year for Ontario's health system, the researchers calculated.</p>
<p>While that doesn't fully offset the cost of the program, it still makes economic sense when a measure known as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) is taken into account, according to Sander. It's a method of quantifying the quality of a year of life, on a scale of zero to one. A year in perfect health would score a one whereas someone sick in bed for months may have a QALY equal to 0.5.</p>
<p>The review, published yesterday in the journal PLoS Medicine, found that the cost to generate one year of perfect health through universal influenza vaccination was $10,797. In Canada, an initiative is considered cost-effective for the health system if it costs less than $50,000 to gain one QALY.</p>
<p>With so much attention paid to influenza vaccines recently because of the H1N1 pandemic, the study's findings should be of interest to provincial governments that may be considering revamping their vaccine delivery programs.</p>
<p>There was heightened demand for seasonal flu shots among the general population last year as many people rolled up their sleeves for one at the same time as getting their H1N1 vaccination.</p>

<div>THE LOONIE HITS PARITY / TOURISM</div>
<div>Report on Business: Canadian</div>

<p>TRANSPORTATION REPORTER</p>
<p>Canadians are warming to foreign travel as the post-recession mindset perks up with the loonie's ascent, spurring forecasts of a robust summer for trips to the United States and overseas.</p>
<p>For those looking for adventures south of the border and abroad, the Canadian dollar's climb to parity with the greenback, if sustained, will save them hundreds of dollars on foreign vacations this summer.</p>
<p>Nina Slawek, who co-owns consumer travel website TakeOffEh.com, said tour operators saw bookings to Europe begin to improve in February, as the Canadian economy healed and the loonie strengthened.</p>
<p>“There is pent-up demand for travel,” Ms. Slawek said yesterday.</p>
<p>After last year's recession and H1N1 influenza outbreak dampened travel, Canadians are increasingly choosing to visit the U.S. and overseas destinations, especially Europe, industry watchers say.</p>
<p>“There is something about the Canadian dollar getting at par with the U.S. dollar. People say, ‘Wow, this may not last.' Last year, we had the recession and H1N1 and a whole host of reasons not to travel. But the confidence seems to be back,” said Allison Wallace, spokeswoman for Flight Centre Canada, a Vancouver-based travel agency group. Flight Centre is coming off its best March, when it enjoyed a spike in flights to places such as Florida, California and Las Vegas. Ms. Wallace said Europe is now on the radar of many Canadians.</p>
<p>“If the dollar stays at par or close, we expect it to have a very strong influence on Europe travel this April to September. It will definitely be the incentive needed for anyone sitting on the fence about whether or not to go this summer,” Ms. Wallace said.</p>
<p>Robert Kokonis, president of airline consulting firm AirTrav Inc., is booking a trip this summer to Finland, and he reckons that his family stands to save nearly $1,300, or 18 per cent, from what hotels, car rental, food, a cruise and other items would have cost last summer, before the loonie strengthened against the euro. For instance, six nights at a hotel in Finland that would have left his family with a $1,340 bill last summer now costs $238 less, based on this week's exchange rates.</p>
<p>Jonathan Carroll, president of vacation retailer itravel2000, said he has been witnessing a healthy recovery in outbound travel.</p>
<p>“People feel good about the Canadian economy, when they compare it to the U.S. or the U.K.,” Mr. Carroll said. “Parity changes the mindset of the Canadian consumer, and attitudes toward travel changes. You're getting a better bang for the buck.”</p>
<p>On the flip side, last year's recession sharply reduced travel to Canada. The downward trend for inbound tourists into Canada won't be easy to shake this year because of the rising loonie, overshadowing some of the benefits of the post-Olympic glow from the Vancouver Games, travel experts say.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Officials weigh free flu shots for all Manitobans after study -</b>
</div><div>By Jen Skerritt    </div>

</p>
<p>HEALTH officials are reviewing whether to extend a free annual flu shot to all Manitobans on the heels of the H1N1 outbreak and new evidence that shows it could save lives.</p>
<p>A new study of Ontario's universal flu shot program released Tuesday shows that offering the vaccine to the entire population appears to reduce the overall number of deaths and hospitalizations and may drive up vaccination rates. The review, published in the journal PLoS Medicine, found 34,000 flu cases were prevented, 111 deaths were avoided, about 780 hospitalizations and 7,745 emergency room visits were prevented and about 30,000 fewer Ontarians visited a doctor for flu symptoms. Researchers calculated that preventing thousands of people from getting sick saved the Ontario health system $7.8 million per year.</p>
<p>Most provinces, including Manitoba, target their free flu shot programs to people who are at high risk of developing complications from seasonal influenza, including the elderly and those with chronic medical conditions.</p>
<p>Chief medical officer Dr. Joel Kettner said Manitoba officials will look closely at the data from Ontario to see whether healthy Manitobans aged two to 64 could benefit from a free annual flu shot. He said experts were already considering this before last year's H1N1 outbreak struck a higher proportion of young, healthy adults who didn't fall in the high-risk category and aren't eligible for the free annual flu shot.</p>
<p>Kettner said extending the flu shot to more Manitobans could also reduce confusion over who is eligible for the vaccine. Less than half of eligible Manitobans get the annual vaccine.</p>
<p>About 20 per of all Manitobans get vaccinated, compared to about 40 per cent of Ontarians.</p>
<p>"We are looking at this, absolutely," Kettner said.</p>
<p>"We've always been aware that seasonal flu is a challenge and that our own vaccine rates have never been as high."</p>
<p>Kettner cautioned there are still concerns that a universal flu shot program will reduce the focus on high-risk Manitobans who would benefit the most from the vaccine. He said the National Advisory Committee on Immunization is reviewing the merits of offering a universal flu shot, and that Manitoba will wait to hear its findings before making any concrete decisions.</p>
<p>Kettner said the province is already bracing for confusion over who is eligible for this year's flu shot after Manitoba had two separate immunization campaigns last fall -- one for H1N1 and one for seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Kettner said he expects the pandemic H1N1 strain will be included in this fall's seasonal flu shot, and that the province will announce any changes to its immunization program by late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>"Now we're likely going to have them combined in one vaccine so that could simplify things, but we also need to avoid confusion for people over who is being recommended and eligible."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>OTTAWA'S H1N1 AD BLITZ COST $37M; Health experts divided on program's effectiveness</b>
</div><div>Tom Blackwell   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>822 words</div><div>7 April 2010</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>The federal government spent $37-million on advertising and other communications related to the H1N1 flu pandemic, more than it devoted to antiviral drugs or managing the outbreak combined, according to newly divulged cost figures.</p>
<p>A prominent critic of government response to H1N1 said much of that ad blitz came after the epidemic had peaked, urging Canadians to get flu shots at a time when they were virtually pointless.</p>
<p>"If it's well spent for a legitimate medical emergency, that's fine," said Dr. Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief medical officer of health, who has repeatedly argued that public-health agencies overreacted to the pandemic.</p>
<p>"It was the persistence of the immunization program, the persistence of the advertising after the outbreak had passed that really I find most offensive."</p>
<p>In all, the Public Health Agency of Canada spent $322-million on the H1N1 campaign, according to an estimate dated Jan. 27 and released through access to information legislation.</p>
<p>One public-health expert, however, says the money was well-spent, calling mass communications a crucial preventive tool against large-scale disease threats.</p>
<p>"It's the difference between dealing with the health of an individual and dealing with the health of a population," said Debra Lynkowski, CEO of the Canadian Public Health Association.</p>
<p>"If we hadn't implemented the plan and we hadn't invested and the outbreak was more severe, we can only guess what the price might have been in human lives or the health-care system."</p>
<p>That $322-million cost does not include the hundreds of millions spent by provincial governments and local public health units on their share of the cost of 40 million doses of vaccine, on administering the shots and on their own advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>Based on federal and provincial estimates, the total was likely at least $1-billion.</p>
<p>The emergence of a totally new flu virus last spring -- and its rapid spread around the world -- prompted a massive response by public-health agencies that had long been bracing for the arrival of the first flu pandemic since 1960s.</p>
<p>Governments came under intense pressure to stockpile enough Tamiflu and other anti-viral drugs, and to produce and start supplying an H1N1 vaccine as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Although the virus made a small minority of otherwise healthy people very sick, it produced relatively mild illness in the vast majority of patients. Canada recorded 428 deaths, compared to an estimated 4,000 who die annually from the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>The public-health agency cost estimate includes communications spending of about $12-million during the pandemic's first wave last spring, and $26-million in the second wave last fall.</p>
<p>Other costs included $14-million for anti-virals, $8.6-million for enhanced emergency response, $21-million for surveillance and outbreak management, $3.6-million for rapid research. The agency also spent $245-million for the federal share of the vaccine purchase, with the provinces contributing approximately $160-million.</p>
<p>Dr. Schabas, though, questioned the continued push to get people vaccinated late last year with an ad campaign that he said played up people's fears. Public-health agency data suggests that the pandemic peaked in the last week of October, and was all but over by the end of November. Meanwhile, the vaccine takes a week to two weeks to be fully effective.</p>
<p>Experience from the spring wave should have tipped off authorities to the pandemic's fairly benign nature, but Canada was already hugely invested in battling a pandemic, said Dr. Schabas.</p>
<p>"There was a willingness in this country not to look critically at [the H1N1 flu], to accept it at face value, to jump to wrong conclusions," he said.</p>
<p>Ms. Lynkowski argued, though, that the money and effort ploughed into fighting the virus may well have "nipped it in the bud," and ensured that the pandemic was not the dire health emergency many experts had anticipated.</p>
<p>As to ad campaigns urging people to get vaccinated late last year, she said it is important that such outreach coincides with vaccine availability, and that is when it began to be offered to the general public.</p>
<p>In Ontario, the government totalled $150-million in costs -- though it had budgeted more than four times that amount -- including $40-million for the vaccine. B.C. spent $80-million, including $13-million for the vaccine. Nova Scotia's costs totalled $22-million, said a government spokeswoman.</p>
<p>In addition, local public health units probably spent about $15 for each of the 25 million doses of vaccine they administered in clinics, said Dr. Schabas, also medical officer of health for eastern Ontario's Hastings and Prince Edward Counties</p>

</p>
<p>Public Health Reporter --</p>
<p>Immunizing the entire population against the flu prevents more than 60 per cent of cases and makes more economic sense than singling out high-risk groups for protection, a new study concludes.</p>
<p>“Compared to a targeted influenza immunization program, the universal program reduces influenza illness attack rates, morbidity and mortality at reasonable cost to the taxpayer,” said Beate Sander, a researcher in the division of clinical decision-making and health care research at the University Health Network in Toronto.</p>
<p>The research, published in today’s (WED) edition of the journal Public Library of Science (PLoS) Medicine, examined data from Ontario, which began offering flu vaccine free-of-charge to all residents in 2000.</p>
<p>To date, Ontario is the only province that has a universal seasonal flu vaccine program. (By contrast, every jurisdiction offered H1N1 influenza vaccine to residents.)</p>
<p>While Ontario’s program is universal, only 42 per cent of the population actually gets immunized. In other provinces, which tend to offer the vaccine to those over 65 and those with respiratory illnesses, the vaccination rate is 28 per cent, according to background information in the paper.</p>
<p>Ms. Sander and her colleagues at the University Toronto, where she is a doctoral student, found that the universal program costs about $40-million a year, which includes cost of vaccine, promotion and physician compensation.</p>
<p>They compared that program to one that targeted high-risk groups like the elderly and those with chronic illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which would cost about $20-million.</p>
<p>The conclusion, broadly speaking, was that the additional costs are offset by the savings that result from fewer people getting sick and seeking medical attention for influenza symptoms.</p>
<p>The researchers found that, on average in Ontario, the universal vaccine program prevented:</p>
<p>* Almost 35,000 cases of the flu, or about 61 per cent of cases each season;</p>
<p>· 111 deaths, a 28 per cent reduction in mortality;</p>
<p>· 786 influenza-related hospitalizations, a 46 per cent drop;</p>
<p>· 7,745 emergency room visits for flu treatment, or 61 per cent fewer visits;</p>
<p>· More than 30,000 visits to doctors for treatment, also a 61 per cent drop.</p>
<p>Overall, the universal vaccine program cut treatment costs by just over half, the researchers found.</p>
<p>Ms. Sander said the figures almost certainly underestimate the benefits of vaccination because “a lot of people who get sick with the flu don’t seek medical attention” and the calculations do not include the economic benefits that come from workers not taking sick days and children not missing school.</p>
<p>She stressed, too, that the numbers are averages, based on data from three years before the introduction of universal vaccination and four years after.</p>
<p>“Some seasons are mild and some are severe but you can’t know that in advance,” she said in an interview. “But, on average, it’s cost effective to have a universal program.”</p>
<p>The principal critique of universal flu vaccine programs is that they tend to attract healthier members of the population.</p>
<p>Ms. Sander conceded that is true but said “healthy people transmit the flu, too.”</p>
<p>Asked if other provinces are making a mistake with targeted vaccination programs instead of universal plans, Ms. Sander responded cautiously, saying: “I don’t think it’s necessarily a mistake. But our economic evaluation suggests the relationship between costs and health benefits make universal vaccination economically attractive.”</p>
<p>Between 4,000 and 8,000 people die of influenza in Canada each year, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccine maker feared delays; Inspections frustrated producer of H1N1 shots, but Health Canada says 'monitoring necessary'</b>
</div><div>Joanna Smith Toronto Star    </div>
<div>637 words</div><div>6 April 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star    </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The pharmaceutical company that made the swine flu vaccine feared frequent visits by federal inspectors would slow down production, according to newly released documents.</p>
<p>Emails between Paul Lucas, president and CEO of <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, and senior officials at Health Canada last November reveal the company was frustrated at the prospect of an extra visit by inspectors to its Ste-Foy, Que., facility, where it produced the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>The Toronto Star obtained the correspondence under the Access to Information Act.</p>
<p>In an email dated Nov. 1, 2009, Lucas expressed surprise that Health Canada wanted to send inspectors to the plant the next day since they'd been there the day before.</p>
<p>"I understand the difficult position that everyone is in during this pandemic situation and the various pressures in the system," Lucas wrote in the email sent to Morris Rosenberg, deputy minister at Health Canada.</p>
<p>"However, I must emphasize that while these inspections build confidence for you in the stringent quality controls of the (<span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>) production process, they divert valuable (<span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>) resources and therefore have the unavoidable consequence of extending release times for delivery of H1N1 vaccine to Canada and our subsequent commitments to other countries as well."</p>
<p>Spokespeople for <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> and Health Canada both said Thursday the on-site visits did not end up delaying the release of the vaccine.</p>
<p>The exchange came at a time when the federal government was being heavily criticized for depending almost entirely on <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> to produce the Canadian version of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>A disruption in the supply line was partially to blame for long queues at flu clinics across the country and Ottawa, having already told Canadians that doses would arrive by the millions every week, was under pressure to deliver on that promise at a time when <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> was pumping out less than 10 per cent of that amount.</p>
<p>Assistant deputy minister Meena Ballantyne described the visits in an email to Lucas Nov. 2 as "instrumental in providing a deeper understanding of the issues."</p>
<p>She wrote that inspectors wanted to visit to monitor quality issues and that physically being in the plant "would provide a greater degree of certainty" because the team could go see the production line to resolve problems as they happened and would be able to ask questions and get answers right away without wasting time "going back and forth on the phone."</p>
<p>Lucas sent another email to Rosenberg following the proposed Nov. 2 visit that provided more details about the impact on human resources.</p>
<p>Lucas said an unidentified person "is quite concerned about impact on our ability to release on time" and noted staff had spent a total of 26 hours with inspectors, as one person was tied up for eight hours and another three people were busy for six hours each.</p>
<p>The exchange ended there, but inspectors continued their visits for awhile, as a Health Canada spokesman said officials were onsite between Sept. 30 and Oct. 2 and then again between Oct. 30 and Dec. 11.</p>
<p>That suggests the warning about wasting time went unheeded.</p>
<p>"Our monitoring efforts were necessary as part of our mandate in authorizing a safe and effective vaccine for Canadians when they needed it," department spokesman Philippe Laroche wrote Thursday when asked whether Health Canada shared the concern.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> said producing a high-quality vaccine was its top priority.</p>
<p>"(<span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>) worked with Health Canada to ensure that each vaccine lot released to the provinces and territories consistently met these stringent quality and safety standards," company spokeswoman Michelle Smolenaars Hunter wrote in an email Thursday.</p>

<p>Re: Swine flu threat was overblown, health official says, March 24.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu (Swine flu) incident referred to in The Star clearly demonstrates that the first line of defence for humans is ourselves. Our bodies contain all the necessary ingredients needed to manufacture antibodies to suppress virulent diseases and infections.</p>
<p>Those of us 65 years or older have been exposed to many more pathogens, germs and diseases than the under-35-year-old generation.</p>
<p>Consequently, our bodies have developed natural biologic defences against many infectious diseases, including Swine flu. The early vaccine inoculations certainly urged our body mechanisms to react to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Through the past winter season, we did not even have a sniffy cold. Thanks to early vaccination for regular flu and the H1N1 flu, that is a hearty testimonial to living actively and smartly, each of us over 85 years of age.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hospitals flunk infection review - Accreditation body cites lax monitoring of practices</b>

</p>
<p>Winnipeg hospitals failed to meet "high-priority" infection-control standards, according to a review that found they aren't doing enough to prevent the spread of highly contagious infections like MRSA and C. difficile.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's latest accreditation report reveals the region fell short in 13 of 17 national standards for containing and reducing the spread of in-hospital infections. The assessment found the health authority does not adequately analyze infection data to identify clusters and outbreaks, and doesn't monitor whether staff comply with infection-control procedures, including handwashing and proper cleaning of patient and staff areas.</p>
<p>The health authority recently agreed to share the report's findings with the Free Press.</p>
<p>The final report was completed in September 2009 after teams flagged gaps during a site visit in November 2008. When reviewers note problems, health-care organizations are required to submit evidence of what they've done to address the gaps before a final report is issued six months later.</p>
<p>Brenda Dyck, director of WRHA's infection prevention and control program, said health officials do monitor outbreaks and infection rates in Winnipeg hospitals and will visit to see what's not working if a particular ward records high rates. Dyck maintains the health authority does meet all required standards, but she said the WRHA was unable to respond to some of the concerns raised by reviewers because officials were busy dealing with H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"I think we're very committed to ensuring we're doing a good job and ensure we're keeping with national standards and guidelines," Dyck said.</p>
<p>"To be perfectly honest, these were standards I felt we were meeting."</p>
<p>Accreditation Canada was unable to comment on the specifics of the WRHA report due to confidentiality requirements. However, a spokeswoman said reviewers mark standards as "unmet" when they see areas that need improvement.</p>
<p>Hospital infections are classified as "adverse events," since they can lengthen a patient's hospital stay and lead to potentially serious complications. Last year, a Free Press investigation revealed outbreaks of highly contagious viruses and antibiotic-resistant superbugs in city hospitals infected more than 1,400 people in a two-year period.</p>
<p>The WRHA's most recent hospital infection data posted online show 813 patients acquired infections such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), C. difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococci in city hospitals between March 2008 and September 2009.</p>
<p>Accreditation Canada CEO Wendy Nicklin said infection control standards are still evolving and the review helps health-care organizations bring up their standards to include the latest best practices. For example, Nicklin said hand hygiene was recently included as a new standard.</p>
<p>Dyck said the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority now plans to audit how many health-care workers actually wash their hands and will work to standardize its cleaning and disinfection procedures. Health officials recently hired an epidemiologist to track surgical infection rates to help reduce complications after surgery.</p>
<p>"There's always areas for improvement," Dyck said.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infection control for Toronto's University Health Network, said hospitals across the country are still struggling to change the health-care culture that views infections as "the cost of doing business." He said people would be outraged if five patients died after being given the wrong medication or blood, but there is little outrage when hundreds of patients acquire potentially life-threatening infections in hospital.</p>
<p>"We keep saying we have a problem here, but who's picking up the ball and running with it?" Gardam said. "We treat it as the cost of doing business, but many of these things can be improved."</p>
<p>jen.skerritt@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Standards WRHA did not meet:</p>
<p>-- Monitors compliance with infection prevention and control policies and procedures, and makes improvements as appropriate (83 per cent of organizations nationwide met this criterion).</p>
<p>-- The organization has policies and procedures to contain and prevent the spread of infections, including using ventilation and isolation precautions, and cohorting as necessary (95 per cent of organizations nationwide met this).</p>
<p>-- It properly cleans and disinfects client and staff areas (96 per cent of organizations nationwide met this.)</p>
<p>-- The protocol includes processes for managing new, rare or problematic viruses or bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant organisms. (91 per cent of national organizations met this.)</p>
<p>-- Source: Accreditation Canada Final Report</p>
<p>Dangerous infections that can</p>
<p>spread in hospitals:</p>
<p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) lives on the skin. The bacteria can get inside the body through an open wound or sore and can cause boils, pimples and blood infections.</p>
<p>C. difficile spores can linger on bed rails, walls, toilet seats, lab coats and stethoscopes and make their way down into the colon once people ingest the spores by touching their mouths. It is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea among hospitalized patients, and can cause intestinal problems like colitis.</p>
<p>Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are antibiotic-resistant germs that live in people's bowels and can cause infections.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Trades exhibit left $3M legacy; WorldSkills '09 surplus to aid city students</b>
</div><div>Sarah McGinnis   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>773 words</div><div>3 April 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>A fter being battered by the economic downturn, Calgary's hospitality sector received a $100-million boost last summer by hosting an international skilled trades competition.</p>
<p>Six months after WorldSkills Calgary 2009 ended, organizers are preparing to convert a $3.2-million surplus into scholarships and other educational programs promoting careers in the trades.</p>
<p>"This feels wonderful. This is a textbook case of the community working together to make things happen . . . and build a legacy which can change perceptions," said Guy Mallabone, chairman of the WorldSkills Calgary 2009 organizing committee.</p>
<p>From Sept. 1 to 7, Calgary hosted almost 20,000 delegates from dozens of countries as young workers competed for gold in such varied events as welding, carpentry and landscaping.</p>
<p>For the week, the Stampede grounds became a staging area to accommodate the 151,589 visitors, including the almost 60,000 on school trips to witness the events.</p>
<p>Hotels, restaurants and shops were bustling with an influx of visitors during what was a less-than-stellar year for tourism.</p>
<p>An economic development study completed after World-Skills Calgary estimated $100 million was spent, thanks to the 29,245 booked hotel rooms, as well as meals and souvenirs purchased by visitors, said Mallabone.</p>
<p>"The manager of the Westin said the event generated $1 million for his hotel alone," said Mallabone.</p>
<p>The boost to tourism couldn't come at a better time, said Ald. Ric McIver. "I think $100 million in the Calgary economy last year was huge. There were a lot of restaurants, hotels, taxis, flower shops and other services who really needed that income."</p>
<p>While visitors may have spent freely, those running the show were keeping close watch on their pennies.</p>
<p>WorldSkills Calgary had a $55-million budget to host the weeklong international event, with funds coming from industry sponsors and all levels of government.</p>
<p>The City of Calgary pledged $3.3 million, but only ended up spending $2.8 million for its share of hosting duties.</p>
<p>WorldSkills Calgary officials were left with a $3.2-million surplus. So far, there are plans to dedicate $1.5 million of the surplus to scholarships.</p>
<p>Approximately $250,000 is heading to SAIT Polytechnic for a career exploration centre, and a further $300,000 will go to the Calgary Board of Education for similar career-focused initiatives, said Mallabone.</p>
<p>Volunteer groups such as Mount Royal University will also receive a financial thank you when the surplus is handed out.</p>
<p>The donations come on top of the $16 million worth of equipment already given to 105 Alberta schools and post-secondary institutions.</p>
<p>Mallabone applauded city officials for helping co-ordinate the massive event.</p>
<p>Supporting a vibrant festival culture is important for Calgary, said Beth Gignac, manager of arts and culture.</p>
<p>Lessons learned at WorldSkills formed the basis of the city's revised festival and event policy.</p>
<p>Organizers at future WorldSkills events in London and Leipzig, Germany, have asked for a series of teleconferencing and long-distance coaching sessions from city officials to learn how they organized the event here, said Gignac.</p>
<p>Part of their interest in organizing strategies could come from the complications presented when the stepfather of a competitor from New Zealand died of H1N1 flu-related causes.</p>
<p>The flu scare generated considerable media attention, but did not stem the tide of people eager to attend the event.</p>
<p>Gignac credits two years of planning and clearly defined roles for helping manage the incident. Within 90 minutes of learning of the death, WorldSkills officials met with the city's disaster response team to map out how to cope, said Mallabone, who remains impressed by the response.</p>
<p>While organizational triumphs and budget surpluses are positive legacies for WorldSkills Calgary, the main goal of hosting the event was to introduce young people to a variety of career possibilities they might not otherwise have considered.</p>
<p>Already, SAIT has had a higher volume of calls from potential students inquiring about programs this year over previous years, said Mallabone.</p>
<p>With several city departments dependant on highly qualified, skilled workers, that's exactly what Gignac wants to hear. "If we want to continue to build a dynamic community we can't do that without skilled trades people," she said.</p>

<p>It is too soon to determine whether tens of thousands of doses of H1N1 swine flu vaccine may have to be thrown out if they are not used before their expiration date, a U.S. health official said on Thursday. The United States ordered enough antigen to make 229 million doses of vaccine a year ago. About 162 million doses have been shipped and between 81 and 91 million doses have been administered.</p>

<p>The high rate of tuberculosis among aboriginals in Canada -- roughly 30 times higher than that of the non-aboriginal population -- is shameful. There is no reason why Canadians should be at higher risk than people in Third World countries.</p>
<p>A new Health Canada report has shown that the numbers are even worse in Inuit communities -- almost 150 times higher than among non-aboriginals.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is highly contagious, and is spread through the air. It can be spread by a carrier coughing, sneezing or even breathing close to another person. Contributing factors are overcrowded homes, malnutrition and poor overall health.</p>
<p>This is not a distant problem, one that affects people somewhere else in Canada. TB is a problem on Vancouver Island, affecting our friends and neighbours -- if they happen to be in aboriginal communities, that is.</p>
<p>Port Alberni has been dealing with a major outbreak of TB since 2006. About four dozen cases have been reported, and 3,000 people have been screened because with every new case, all of the people in regular contact with the infected person must be tested.</p>
<p>Some people are able to resist the infection, but those who are already weakened because of malnutrition or other factors will be susceptible.</p>
<p>A major concern is the quality of housing. Too many houses on reserves are overcrowded, might not have ready access to safe water, and have mould as well.</p>
<p>That mould has been linked to many problems, including respiratory ailments and immune system complications.</p>
<p>TB is not the only concern. Hepatitis also spreads easily in reserve housing, and the H1N1 flu was prevalent in many aboriginal communities.</p>
<p>Judy Wasylycia-Leis, the NDP's health critic, has called for an emergency debate in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Just talking about the problem will not solve it, but Canada must start somewhere. Since there are so many needs, it should not be hard to find a starting point.</p>
<p>Housing should be replaced, but that is expensive and will take many years, considering that up to 90,000 homes are needed. Water and sewage systems have to be upgraded as well. Vouchers specifying healthy foods could be given out.</p>
<p>A major information campaign covering a wide variety of health-related concerns would also help. The government should spread the word about everything from basic health precautions to the risks of smoking to the fundamentals of home maintenance.</p>
<p>Another approach would be to take direct action when TB is discovered. In the Northwest Territories, patients are asked to go to a health clinic twice a week so they can be seen to be using their medication.</p>
<p>While that might seem heavy-handed -- and it might raise fears that non-aboriginals are telling aboriginals how to live their lives -- there is no question that something must be done.</p>
<p>We should not accept the high rate of tuberculosis in our own country. We know what has to be done; we just need to get moving.</p>

<p>Continuing activity of pandemic H1N1 influenza in the U.S. Southeast, particularly in Georgia, is raising fears of a third wave of swine flu, federal officials said recently.</p>
<p>They urged Americans to continue getting vaccinated as a preventive measure in case a new outbreak occurs.</p>
<p>Although swine flu activity is still low in most of the U.S., flu-related hospitalizations in Georgia have, since the beginning of February, been higher than they were last October at the height of the second wave of swine flu, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a telephone news conference.</p>
<p>A CDC team was sent March 6 to assist state officials investigating the outbreak, but they have so far found nothing unusual related to the outbreak or the virus itself. "There is no evidence the virus has changed in Georgia," she said. Alabama and South Carolina are also reporting regional activity of the virus, and some unusual activity has also been noted in Hawaii and New Mexico.</p>
<p>The Southeast is where the second wave of the pandemic began last fall, but experts generally attributed that to the earlier start of school in the region.</p>
<p>Swine flu has so far infected about 60 million Americans.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff did much complaining about prorogation but Canadians seem to like his party better when it is not in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom says sitting governments – Stephen Harper's Conservatives in this case – lose ground when Parliament is sitting and the opposition has a daily chance to rip verbal holes through their policies. But Mr. Ignatieff has been turning conventional wisdom on its head.</p>
<p>When federal politicians left for home just before Christmas last year, the Liberals were far back in the public opinion polls. Surveys suggested they had the support of about 26 per cent of decided voters – seven to nine points behind the ruling Tories.</p>
<p>Over the course of the fall session, Mr. Ignatieff and his caucus lobbed continuous accusations of a cover-up in the treatment of Afghan detainees at government benches. The assault chipped away at Conservative popularity – the Tories fell from the low 40s in October to the mid-30s in December – but it had little effect on the Liberals' own fortunes.</p>
<p>Then, just before the New Year, Mr. Harper decided to prorogue – and the Liberal numbers took off. On Feb. 4, an Ekos poll put Mr. Ignatieff's Liberals ahead of the Conservatives, albeit by the barest of margins. The Liberals sat at 31.9 per cent and the Conservatives trailed with 31 per cent– a spread that was within the margin of error of 1.7 per cent.</p>
<p>Week after week, pollsters described the two parties as being in a “horse race.”</p>
<p>But the Liberal surge was not to last. The House returned at the beginning of last month and the downward slide began anew. A new Ekos poll released yesterday suggests Mr. Ignatieff's party has the support of just 27 per cent of decided voters.</p>
<p>Not that the Conservatives had anything to cheer about: They sit at 32.2 per cent support – far from majority territory.</p>
<p>“The Liberals have made bad choices in terms of the issues they have chosen to focus on when the House is in session,” said Kory Teneycke, Mr. Harper's former director or communications. “There is ample polling to demonstrate that the Canadian public is not fixated on the Afghan detainee story.”</p>
<p>The Liberals “burnt up an awful lot of time” on that issue and others that are not particularly connecting with the Canadian public, Mr. Teneycke said. “And they are not issues that are ultimately going to be ballot questions for anybody,” like the economy, he said.</p>
<p>But Warren Kinsella, a long-time Liberal strategist, said he believes the Conservatives are retaining their lead as a result of factors beyond the control of political parties.</p>
<p>“An improving economy, the absence of H1N1-type crises, people feeling good about the Olympics, the warmer weather, all that kind of stuff” plays a role, Mr. Kinsella said.</p>
<p>The Conservatives “also seem to be making a conscious effort to lay low – never a bad idea. [Former Liberal prime minister] Jean Chrétien, for one, knew the value of staying out of the papers. Conservatives may like to claim credit for their situation, but they shouldn't. They're still far from a majority – and the support for the two main parties is still more or less within the margin of error.”</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The federal government wants to know whether warning Canadians against travelling to Mexico at the height of the swine flu pandemic influenced the way people spread the disease into Canada and around the world.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada plans to award a $176,000 contract to a Toronto-based team of researchers to analyze international air traffic patterns during the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>The idea is to figure out whether the warnings by Canadian and international public health officials had any impact on where and when people travelled during the outbreak, and if that meant slowing down or speeding up the spread of disease.</p>
<p>"There is a science behind how we interact as a global community and ... if we can understand how we move, indirectly we understand how infectious diseases move, because essentially we're the ones that are transporting the disease around the world primarily through commercial air travel," said project leader Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease specialist at St. Michael's Hospital.</p>
<p>The work also involves studying flight patterns during the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics to get an idea of how mass gatherings could accelerate the spread of disease.</p>
<p>The government chose Khan and his team for this contract because they have been working on something called the Bio-Diaspora project since 2004. It uses mathematical modelling and access to international aviation data to calculate when and where an infectious disease would spread following an outbreak anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The federal public health agency hopes to use this information to see if travel warnings, which the World Health Organization is increasingly hesitant to recommend because of their potentially devastating impact on international trade and tourism, really do much good.</p>
<p>It could also help the government decide whether it needs to improve its quarantine measures or change the way it screens air passengers.</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Lysyshyn, a medical adviser at the Public Health Agency of Canada's Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response in Ottawa, envisioned a system that could eventually be used in real time that would let public health officials know which airports to examine more closely and the best time to issue a travel advisory, if any.</p>

<p>REGULATOR BACKS ENBRIDGE</p>
<p>CALGARY / Shippers on <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>.'s Canada-U. S. oil pipeline system lost a bid Wednesday to force Enbridge to scrap a tolling deal for a new line on the grounds the recession led to lower crude output than expected.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected a petition from Suncor, Imperial Oil and other shippers to get Enbridge to revise the agreed tariffs associated with the $3.3-billion Alberta Clipper pipeline to Wisconsin, which are due to take effect today.</p>
<p>However, Canada's National Energy Board appeared to leave the door open for some relief for the oil producers, which argue the pipeline is not currently needed. The board said Wednesday it may rule on the usefulness of the Alberta Clipper project at a later date.</p>
<p>PIPELINE AT 2.5 MILLION BARRELS</p>
<p>CALGARY / <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. chief executive Hal Kvisle said the line fill for the Keystone pipeline is about 2.5 million barrels, almost a third of the nine million barrels needed to start deliveries to the U.S. Midwest.</p>
<p>"We would expect to have that crude delivered to Wood River, Patoka by the end of the second quarter," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>The pipeline is being built in stages. The first phase, from Hardisty, Alta., to Wood River and Patoka, Ill., will be in service in mid-2010 with a throughput capacity of about 435,000 barrels a day, TransCanada said earlier this month.</p>
<p>The company had originally scheduled the start date for the Keystone pipeline for the first quarter of 2010 but delays in finishing some of the pump stations and requests from the National Energy Board for further verification of the integrity of part of the pipeline pushed the start date back.</p>
<p>BMO RAISES GROWTH FORECAST</p>
<p>TORONTO / <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> raised its Canadian economic growth forecast for the second time this month, after a report Wednesday showed a faster-than-expected increase in gross domestic product for January, said deputy chief economist Doug Porter. He said he expects first-quarter growth of 5.5 per cent instead of 4.7 per cent, and raised the estimate for all of 2010 to 3.4 per cent from 3.2 per cent.</p>
<p>"We have seen a month-long wave of stronger-than-expected results," Porter said. "It's really been a little bit of everything but GDP was the tipping point."</p>
<p>BARRICK SUIT MAY CUT OUTPUT</p>
<p>TORONTO / <span class="companylink">Barrick Gold Corp</span>.'s plan to double production at a Nevada gold mine complex this year by digging out an additional $625 million US in deposits may turn on a judge's decision in an environmental suit by American Indian tribes.</p>
<p>The company forecast a production increase of 562,000 ounces with the addition this year of the Cortez Hills mine, located four kilometres from an older Nevada installation that produced 518,000 ounces last year.</p>
<p>The state's Shoshone tribes claim that the U.S. Bureau of Land Management didn't thoroughly evaluate the environmental impact of the mine expansion.</p>
<p>They sued in 2008 to stop the new operation, about 320 kilometres east of Reno, and are seeking a court order forbidding production until a trial is held.</p>
<p>TECK TERM DEBT NEARLY PAID</p>
<p>TORONTO / <span class="companylink">Teck Resources</span> expects to pay back the term debt from its 2008 acquisition of Fording Canadian Coal Trust in the "very near term" and could soon consider reinstating its shareholder dividend, the company's chief executive said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The term loan will be gone in the very near term," Don Lindsay said in an interview. The company's term loan, which stood at $800 million US earlier this month, is the remnant of $9.8 billion in short-term debt taken on to finance the purchase of coal producer Fording in 2008, just as credit markets were seizing up and commodity prices were beginning to free-fall.</p>
<p>NORONT, CLIFFS MAY GAIN AID</p>
<p>TORONTO / <span class="companylink">Noront Resources Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">Cliffs Natural Resources Inc</span>., aiming to become North America's only chromite suppliers, may benefit from government support for projects in Ontario.</p>
<p>Noront may develop its Blackbird chromite deposit in tandem with its Eagle One nickel and copper project in the so-called Ring of Fire mineral belt if the Ontario government helps finance transport links and power, Noront chief executive Wes Hanson said in an interview.</p>
<p>Ontario has said it will seek to capitalize on the chromite discovery and has set aside money to train workers.</p>
<p>"It's not common for a government to endorse a mineral belt so forcefully," said Michael Gray, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Genuity Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p>"The message they're sending to the investment community is positive. They see this as an industry driver and as something that will help local, aboriginal communities."</p>
<p>ALAMOS RESERVES RISE</p>
<p>TORONTO / <span class="companylink">Alamos Gold Inc</span>. said proved and probable mineral reserves at its Mulatos mine in Mexico rose 17 per cent in 2009, and the company backed its 2010 production forecast.</p>
<p>The miner plans to install a new screening plant for about $6.5 million US that would increase crusher throughput by up to 20 per cent.</p>
<p>With the additional screening, crushing capacity at Mulatos is expected to range between 15,300 tonnes per day (tpd) and 16,200 tpd, up from the current capacity of 13,500 tpd.</p>
<p>The company said proven and probable mineral reserve at the Mulatos mine increased 17 per cent to 2.39 million ounces in 2009.</p>
<p>GILDAN CHOOSES BANGLADESH</p>
<p>MONTREAL / T-shirtgiantGildanActivewear Inc. has chosen Bangladesh as a base for manufacturing in Asia.</p>
<p>It said Wednesday it has bought a T-shirt plant near Dhaka for $15 million US. CEO Glenn Chamandy told the annual shareholders' meeting in early February that Gildan planned to build a low-cost high-quality manufacturing base in Asia, but excluded China as a potential location.</p>

<p>INVESTORS PAY DEARLY FOR FLIGHT TO BUFFETT MEETING</p>
<p>BERKSHIRE / A non-stop airline ticket from New York to Paris on the first weekend in May costs $1,142 US. A <span class="companylink">Continental Airlines Inc</span>. flight to attend <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway Inc</span>.'s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Neb., the same weekend: $1,433.</p>
<p>As investors have been making plans to attend the event that Berkshire's chairman, Warren Buffett, calls the "Woodstock for capitalists," airlines including Continental and <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines Inc</span>. have been raising prices for the weekend of the meeting.</p>
<p>They're asking four times the normal rate for round-trip tickets, which means New Yorkers will pay more to visit Omaha for the May 1 meeting than to visit London, Rome or Barcelona.</p>
<p>Continental has added one flight from the New York area on April 29 and three on April 30, said Mary Clark, a spokeswoman for the airline. Attendees who bought tickets earlier paid less for their seats, she said. Now, the Houston, Texasbased company is demanding a premium for the spots that remain.</p>
<p>"There does appear to have been high demand," Clark said. "Since many of those fares have already been sold and there are very few seats left, the seats that are left are at the higher fares."</p>
<p>Last year, even as the threat of swine flu kept some shareholders away, a record 35,000 people flooded Omaha's Eppley Airfield, packed the hotels and swarmed the city of 439,000.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Partisan attacks poisons politics for all parties</b>
</div><div>The StarPhoenix</div>
<div>449 words</div><div>1 April 2010</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>The unfair attack by the Saskatchewan Party on Dwain Lingenfelter over the NDP leader collecting a pension for his past services as an MLA only serves to undermine the entire political system for short-term partisan gain.</p>
<p>Despite Saskatchewan Party MLA Bill Boyd's attempt to paint Mr. Lingenfelter in a bad light for collecting a pension while serving in the assembly, the NDP leader is doing nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Like others who served in office before the legislature's pension scheme was revamped for being overly generous, he contributed to the defined benefit plan that's now providing him a benefit of around $3,000 a month.</p>
<p>To argue as Mr. Boyd does, that Mr. Lingenfelter should have asked the government to change the law to allow his pension to be temporarily suspended, because the rules of the plan don't allow members to defer their payments, is pure nonsense.</p>
<p>There's no reason why a pension paid to Mr. Lingenfelter is any different from a pension paid to any other member of the legislature, whether the source is private or public. Some members of Mr. Boyd's own party already get (or soon will be eligible to receive) publicly funded pensions as former teachers, cops, soldiers or civil servants.</p>
<p>Along with current MLAs who may receive income from other sources, whether through investments, business ventures or even farming, those who receive retirement income shouldn't have to forgo it simply because they have chosen to serve the cause of democracy.</p>
<p>It's silly to expect them to do so, and cynical politicking of the highest order to demand that they do it.</p>
<p>Certainly, some members of Mr. Lingenfelter's party sanctimoniously have argued in the past that retired civil servants who are rehired to posts in government shouldn't be allowed to "double-dip."</p>
<p>Yet, serving in politics at the whim of voters isn't the same as a sinecure in the civil service, where job permanence is all but guaranteed. Besides, even in that case, at a time of scarcity of qualified professionals, it's foolish policy to prohibit double-dipping outright if that precludes the temporary rehiring of such persons as retired public health nurses to help with a swine flu vaccination blitz, or others to fill some short-term need elsewhere.</p>
<p>Mr. Lingenfelter says he's tried to mitigate the problem by donating half of his pension income to charity, because taxpayers would have matched his 20 years of contributions. While it's a laudable gesture, he shouldn't have to do it any more than other MLAs who receive any income from other sources.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Guelph hospital balances $118-million budget</b>
</div><div>Vik Kirsch   </div>
<div>Mercury Staff</div>
<div>416 words</div><div>31 March 2010</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>The Guelph General Hospital has balanced its annual $118-million budget for the fiscal year that ends today, though that wasn't a sure thing last fall.</p>
<p>And there's no certainty the hospital will be able to repeat this in the new fiscal year.</p>
<p>The news of a balanced budget achievement was contained in an information package update for the board of commissioners, which met Tuesday evening at the acute care facility on Delhi Street.</p>
<p>Chief executive and president Richard Ernst said in an interview that the hospital is following through on what it said at the beginning of the fiscal year - that it was committed to bringing spending in line with revenue.</p>
<p>"We submitted a budget that would be balanced." That, he said, indeed came to pass, despite challenges.</p>
<p>Board chair Peter Ferraro wasn't surprised the budget was balanced.</p>
<p>"That was consistent with the plan for the year," he said at the board meeting. But he added in an interview that whether the hospital can balance the next budget "remains to be seen."</p>
<p>Costs are rising because of increases to staff earnings under collective agreements, he said.</p>
<p>New budget discussions have begun with the Waterloo Wellington Local Health Integration Network, the provincial health planning and funding body.</p>
<p>The challenges in the year just ended included a deficit last October of slightly more than $189,000 on an annual budget of roughly $118 million, though Ernst said at the time some costs, like employee benefits, typically decline as a year progresses and he wasn't worried.</p>
<p>He said administration has whittled away at expenses since then. It did so by boosting efficiency and making some process improvements in areas like the emergency department, as well as better managing staff sick leave and overtime. Streamlining patient flows by reducing steps required also cut costs, Ernst added.</p>
<p>Further, the anticipated H1N1 flu pandemic didn't materialize. Though there had been spikes at times in patients flocking to the emergency department, it wasn't as busy as initially feared early last fall, when the flu season typically swings into high gear. To counter the threat of a possible pandemic, public health initiated a mass immunization program that inoculated high numbers of area residents.</p>
<p>Ontario hospitals have struggled with large deficits over the past year. Some who lost the battle were assigned special administrators to balance the books, though Guelph General Hospital managed to avoid that.</p>

<p>Dark chocolate may lower risk of heart ailments</p>
<p>The Easter Bunny might lower your chances of having a heart problem.</p>
<p>According to a new study, small doses of chocolate every day could decrease your risk of having a heart attack or stroke by nearly 40 per cent.</p>
<p>German researchers followed nearly 20,000 people over eight years, sending them several questionnaires about their diet and exercise habits.</p>
<p>They found people who had an average of six grams of chocolate per day -- or about one square of a chocolate bar -- had a 39 per cent lower risk of either a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p>The study is to be published today in the European Heart Journal.</p>
<p>Previous studies have suggested dark chocolate in small amounts could be good for you, but this is the first study to track its effects over such a long period of time.</p>
<p>Experts think the flavonols contained in chocolate are responsible. Flavonols, also found in vegetables and red wine, help the muscles in blood vessels widen, which leads to a drop in blood pressure.</p>
<p>But doctors warn that eating large amounts of chocolate could lead to weight gain, a major risk factor for heart problems and strokes.</p>
<p>Minorities have trouble getting health care</p>
<p>Many Canadian women from visible minority groups say they have trouble getting a family physician or specialists to address urgent health concerns or monitor chronic medical conditions.</p>
<p>A new study shows one in three South Asian, West Asian and Arab women have difficulty finding a doctor, getting an appointment or getting referred to specialists.</p>
<p>About 15 per cent of immigrants who've been in Canada less than five years did not have a primary-care doctor, compared with 7.3 per cent of Canadian-born adults.</p>
<p>Almost one-third of women who don't often speak English or French at home reported more difficulties accessing care from a family doctor to monitor health problems.</p>
<p>The study was conducted by researchers at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and the Institute for Clinical and Evaluative Sciences.</p>
<p>Swine flu recovery took months for some</p>
<p>The H1N1 swine flu ceased making headlines a while ago. But many Canadians are just getting over its lasting one-two punch.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Gardam of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion says for those who contracted swine flu, it took weeks to a couple of months to get over it.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada didn't keep records on how many Canadians came down with mild cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>But Gardam says blood tests on a sample group in Ontario suggests just under 10 per cent were infected in the first wave.</p>
<p>He says the second wave was two to three times larger. So he says probably 30 per cent got H1N1.</p>
<p>The public health agency says 424 Canadians died while 8,200 were hospitalized.</p>

<p>HALIFAX, N.S.</p>
<p>Marga Cugnet thought she knew what she was in for when she came down with the H1N1 flu last October.</p>
<p>But the health administrator from Weyburn, Sask., said she was annoyed and somewhat dejected when the potent H1N1 virus left her with lingering symptoms that did not let up until earlier this month.</p>
<p>That's five months of suffering through a hacking, post-flu cough and bouts of fatigue.</p>
<p>"I never went anywhere without having a bag of cough drops with me because I would just get into a coughing spell that wouldn't stop," said Cugnet, the 56-year-old vice-president of primary health with the Sun Country Health Region.</p>
<p>"I knew it could take months to go away, but I didn't think it would last that long."</p>
<p>Even though the global pandemic ceased making headlines weeks ago, the impact of the virus remains fresh in the minds of many Canadians who are just getting over an ailment that delivered a lasting one-two punch.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada didn't keep records on the number of Canadians who contracted mild cases of H1N1, mainly because most of them simply stayed home while recovering.</p>
<p>But Dr. Michael Gardam of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion says blood tests on a sample group in that province suggested that just under 10 per cent of the population was infected in the first wave.</p>
<p>"The second wave was two to three times larger than the first wave, so 30 per cent total is likely reasonable," said Gardam, the agency's director of infectious diseases prevention and control.</p>
<p>These numbers are similar to estimates from other developed countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, he said.</p>
<p>Since April 2009, when the first cases were identified in North America, the Public Health Agency of Canada says 424 Canadians died after contracting the virus and another 8,221 have been hospitalized - 1,472 of them admitted to intensive care.</p>
<p>The infection rate peaked in early November, but there's plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest H1N1 kept tormenting the country well into 2010.</p>

<p>While swine flu has waned across much of North America, the U.S. southeast is reporting an increase in cases of the H1N1 virus, U.S. health officials said Monday. "The flu season is not over yet ... H1N1 has remained persistent in the southeast and now those states are experiencing more local and regional activity," U.S. Surgeon General Regina Benjamin told reporters.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Alta. H1N1 death rate above average; Lower proportion of Albertans obtained vaccination, statistics indicate</b>
</div><div>Richard Cuthbertson   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>644 words</div><div>30 March 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>As the province winds down its H1N1 immunization program this week, numbers suggest a lower proportion of Albertans were vaccinated and a higher rate died from the influenza compared to Canada as a whole.</p>
<p>This comes as the Health Quality Council of Alberta begins a review of H1N1 preparedness and response that will be ready by September and will look at how the province dealt with last year's pandemic.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Public Health Agency of Canada, 71 people with H1N1 have died in Alberta. That's about 19.1 deaths per million people.</p>
<p>In all of Canada, there were 429 deaths -- about 12.6 per million people. Hospitalization rates also showed a similar trend, with more Albertans per million admitted than compared to the country as a whole.</p>
<p>Last month, the chief public health officer of Canada, Dr. David Butler-Jones, said close to 50 per cent of all Canadians had been immunized and in some provinces the numbers were higher than 70 per cent.</p>
<p>The CEO of Alberta Health Services said last week that about 40 per cent of Albertans have been vaccinated. That's a significant number, Dr. Stephen Duckett said, but "you can always do better."</p>
<p>Health Minister Gene Zwozdesky, who asked the health council to do the review, said he doesn't put a lot of emphasis in comparing vaccination rates province to province, as there are sharp differences in populations, demographics and travel distances.</p>
<p>"You can't force people to go out and be vaccinated," he said. "You can only do your best to make them aware of what some potential problems might be if you don't get vaccinated. I think we did a very good job on that part."</p>
<p>When many Albertans think back to the fall of 2009 and the H1N1 immunization program, their memories will likely be dominated by lengthy lineups at clinics that sometimes led to waits of six hours or more.</p>
<p>Some critics believe the response, and the immunization rollout in particular, was mismanaged.</p>
<p>Liberal Leader Dr. David Swann said it was a mistake to allow everyone to get immunized during the early days, rather than focusing strictly on those in high-risk groups, such as pregnant women.</p>
<p>He also said the amalgamation of health regions into one superboard caused a disorganization in the system and a lack of clarity around who was responsible for what.</p>
<p>The province, he says, didn't follow its own plan to deal with a pandemic.</p>
<p>"It was a combination of a number of factors, I believe, that has resulted in increased risk and increased death in the province."</p>
<p>But we were far more prepared for a pandemic than we would have been just 15 years ago, according to Jim Dickinson, a University of Calgary professor who runs Alberta's influenza surveillance program.</p>
<p>That's because the rise of bird flu drew much concern and efforts were made to plan for such a pandemic. But bird flu is not the same as H1N1 and requires a different response, Dickinson says.</p>
<p>While H1N1 spreads more easily but kills less, bird flu is far more fatal, but with less transmission, he said.</p>
<p>With bird flu, if you have a few people getting very ill, you can "contain" around them. But H1N1, while less lethal, spread much wider, needing a different set of precautions, he said.</p>
<p>Dickinson says one of the problems is H1N1 hit before the vaccine was available. That led to a real scramble, he said.</p>

<p>DANISH STUDY DOWNPLAYS MAMMOGRAM BENEFITS</p>
<p>If you're still upset about last fall's recommendation that women begin getting mammograms to screen for breast cancer at age 50 instead of 40 -- and to get them every other year instead of annually -- a new study from Denmark may put you at ease.</p>
<p>Mammographic screening began in Denmark's Funen County (home of Hans Christian Andersen) in 1993.</p>
<p>Between 1997 and 2006, deaths due to breast cancer fell 5 per cent per year among women age 35 to 55 in those areas.</p>
<p>For women between age 55 and 74 -- who would benefit most from screening -- the mortality rate dropped by 1 per cent per year, and for older women there was little change.</p>
<p>Looks like a success for breast cancer screening, right? Not so fast, the researchers said.</p>
<p>They also checked the corresponding mortality rates for the 80 per cent of Danish women who didn't participate in screening programs.</p>
<p>In those areas, breast cancer deaths in the same decade declined 6 per cent per year for women age 35 to 55 and by 2 per cent per year for women age 55 to 74.</p>
<p>Those findings led the researchers to conclude improved treatments and changes in risk factors were responsible for the reduction in breast cancer mortality, not the mammograms.</p>
<p>The researchers also noted the incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) -- a non-invasive growth in a milk duct that sometimes progresses to breast cancer -- remained essentially flat in the nonscreening areas but doubled in Copenhagen and Funen County.</p>
<p>That fits with other experts' concerns that mammograms flag many cases of DCIS that prompt invasive treatments, but wouldn't have been harmful if left alone.</p>
<p>The Danish study was published online last week in the British Medical Journal.</p>
<p>H1N1 VIRUS RESEMBLES 1918 SPANISH FLU</p>
<p>New research shows the pandemic H1N1 virus more closely resembles the 1918 Spanish flu virus than more modern cousins in the same flu family.</p>
<p>Like the Spanish flu virus, the pandemic H1N1 lacks two sugar coats that are seen on contemporary viruses from the same family.</p>
<p>U.S. researchers were surprised to find antibodies that protect against the H1N1 virus also fight the virus that caused the 1918 pandemic.</p>
<p>Researchers say the findings help explain why older people have some immunity to H1N1 and younger people don't.</p>
<p>GENE CAN POINT TO KIDS' CANCER THERAPY PROSPECTS</p>
<p>Researchers have identified a genetic mutation that plays a key role in how children with a rare type of brain tumour are likely to respond to therapy.</p>
<p>A team of researchers from Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children and the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles tested the DNA of 64 children with a choroid plexus carcinoma.</p>
<p>They determined that children with tumours that carry a mutated TP-53 gene did not fare well, compared with those without the genetic alteration.</p>
<p>The discovery means some children with the tumour should be able to avoid radiation and its potentially devastating effects on the developing brain.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Only 20% of Hamiltonians got swine flu shot; Officials targeted 75%, but vaccine wasn't ready for peak</b>

</p>
<p>A public health study released yesterday shows less than 20 per cent of Hamilton's population was vaccinated against the H1N1 virus -- well below the city's target of 75 per cent.</p>
<p>A total of 96,242 people were vaccinated between Oct. 26 and Feb. 6. About 60,000 people got their shots at the city's public health units, while the remaining 36,000 went to their family doctors.</p>
<p>Public health officials say the main reason the uptake was so low was the vaccine wasn't available to the general public when the disease hit its peak.</p>
<p>"The availability of the vaccine was the biggest thing that hindered us throughout," said Dr. Chris Mackie, a Hamilton associate medical officer of health. "If we'd had more vaccinations available upfront, it's almost certain there would have been a higher uptake."</p>
<p>Along with the availability of the vaccine, the public health department says the fact H1N1 was milder than initially expected could have contributed to the low numbers.</p>
<p>There was also much suspicion among residents about the safety of the vaccine. This was the first year Canadian flu shots used an adjuvant, a much-debated immune booster. Fears also circulated the H1N1 shot could cause serious complications such as Guillain-Barré syndrome.</p>
<p>The city chose the 75 per cent target because it was the maximum percentage of the population officials thought they could reach. It also allowed public health to set a budget for the vaccinations.</p>
<p>"It was used as a 'stretch goal' to give us something to work toward, and also a maximum for establishing what we thought the highest costs could reasonably be," Mackie said.</p>
<p>He added Hamilton learned valuable lessons during the H1N1 epidemic, including how other communities across Canada handled their vaccinations.</p>
<p>In Quebec and Vancouver's downtown east side, officials used so-called "push campaigns" that included busing residents to vaccination sites to reach a higher percentage of the population. As a result, Quebec's vaccination rate was one of the highest at 50 per cent.</p>
<p>These strategies could help Hamilton during the next epidemic, Mackie said.</p>
<p>"There are lots of things we could have done better in Hamilton. We could have increased our communication by two to three times about the vaccine itself, about our sites, about transportation issues."</p>
<p>Mackie also argues the 20 per cent vaccination rate is a "lowball" estimate, as doctors offices aren't required to report their vaccination levels and could have administered shots not included in the city's official tally.</p>
<p>The low level of vaccinations means the city spent almost $3 million less than the original $4.4-million budget approved by council last year. The total cost of Hamilton's H1N1 program was $1.74 million, $1.01 million of which was covered by the province. The remaining $73,000 came out of the city's public health budget.</p>

</p>
<p>Where is the British Columbia economy headed now that the 2009 recession is thankfully behind us?</p>
<p>There is a whole alphabet soup L, V, U, W to describe what an economy might do. We do know that B.C. did not have a V-shaped recession. While it did have a dramatic falling off, the downward stroke in the V, which was also experienced in many other areas, only China seems to have enjoyed the fairly immediate and strong recovery that the V implies.</p>
<p>Some are still anticipating that B.C. will have a W recession and, after the first dip last year, are now awaiting a second dip or even a <span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span> recession, that is VW with two more dips yet to come. But the number holding this view is in decline as B.C. continues to motor along. The real pessimists talk about an L recovery in which, once the economy has turned down, it just forgets to come up again. But even economists, those masters of the dismal science, are not that pessimistic.</p>
<p>Perhaps the letter that best outlines the current conditions in B.C. is U. Last year, the economy declined and this year will see nothing too dramatic in either an upward or a downward direction, with the province enjoying a recovery as we move into 2011.</p>
<p>Technically, B.C. is already in a recovery. Its gross provincial product (GPP) is moving up, which means that it is now producing more goods and services as each month passes. Employment is increasing and jobs at both ends of the income spectrum are hard to fill. The talent shortage for people with high level skills and experience is not as extreme as it was two years ago; but good people are still hard to find. And help wanted signs, at least in the major centres, indicate that the eight per cent or so currently unemployed still feel sufficiently optimistic that they can get better than an entry level, minimum wage job.</p>
<p>The most recent labour force data showed about half Canada's job growth occurred in B.C. However, those results were for February when the Olympics were in full swing. We will have to wait for the March Labour Force Survey data to determine how much of the job growth was due to economic recovery and how much was temporary due to the Games.</p>
<p>For the coming 12 months, we do not see any further dramatic dips. We do see the economy continuing to grow and the two per cent to three per cent range used by the B.C. government in its recent budget describes the slow, but steady growth we can anticipate. However, the recovery will not feel much like a recovery for about a year because employment will likely follow its usual post-recession pattern and be the last variable to improve.</p>
<p>Where will the growth come from? First, construction: In spite of much anticipated falling housing prices, real estate values, especially in Metro Vancouver, barely paused in their upward climb during the 2009 recession and bidding wars have now resumed for desirable properties. Rising prices, along with continuing international and interprovincial in-migration, mean that residential construction will remain strong in B.C. except, perhaps, in some of the smaller forest-based towns.</p>
<p>And, unlike what many feared, non-residential construction is not falling out of bed with the end of the Olympics. The B.C. Major Projects inventory included 50 new major projects worth $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 20 major projects actually started construction in that quarter. Over all, capital spending on construction projects has remained at over 95 per cent of its pre-Games level.</p>
<p>Resource demand is healthy, with the woods sector no worse than it has been for some time, coal shipments showing strength and other resources facing growing global demand. Business people were attracted to B.C. by the Games and some plan to look at opportunities here. Games visitors and TV exposure should generate at least enough tourism to more than offset the strong Canadian dollar. Recovery, here we come.</p>
<p>Finally, what lessons have we learned from the 2009 recession? First, no tree grows to the sky. No matter how booming the boom, things eventually turn down. On the other hand, even with pessimists prognosticating the end of the world, recessions will end and most likely a lot sooner than did the Great Depression of the 1930s to which invalid comparisons were made.</p>
<p>Second, don't panic! Much of what we fear never happens. The turn of the century occurred without a hiccup in spite of frantic Y2K forecasts of chaos. The predicted H1N1 pandemic quietly morphed into a very</p>
<p>ordinary flu season. And the recession of 2009 has passed into history.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Region to halt rehiring of retirees; Health officials' hiring plan focuses on new graduates</b>
</div><div>Hannah Scissons   </div>
<div>The StarPhoenix</div>
<div>619 words</div><div>30 March 2010</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>The Saskatoon Health Region will no longer hire back recently retired employees, unless it is an "exceptional case," under a new staffing policy coming into effect Thursday.</p>
<p>The policy is intended to assist in hiring more new grads, ensure the health of the pension plan and reduce sick time, said Bonnie Blakley, vice-president of people strategies with the health region. It comes after a three-year period, from October 2006 to October 2009, during which 44 per cent of retired employees were rehired, most within the first month of retirement.</p>
<p>"There was a time when we had many vacancies and that was a good strategy to get people back," said Blakley. "We now recognize that with fewer vacancies and more grads looking for jobs, we want to make sure we give them that opportunity."</p>
<p>Exceptions to the policy for hard-to-recruit jobs, for example, must be reviewed and approved by the staffing and business processes department in the health region. Employees who are considering retirement have the option to postpone it if they want to continue working in the region, Blakley said.</p>
<p>The policy change comes as part of the health region's "aggressive strategy" to reduce sick time, said Blakley. She said some retirees who have returned to work experience difficulty fulfilling their job responsibilities due to their age.</p>
<p>Of the 380 rehired retirees in the three-year time period between October 2006 and October 2009, the health region paid 25 per cent more in sick-time wages than in paid-time wages to 21 of them, she said.</p>
<p>An additional 47 people received 10 per cent more in sick time than paid time.</p>
<p>"It starts to add up for us in terms of availability for work . . . and having a healthy workplace," Blakley said.</p>
<p>The number of working retirees was also becoming a liability for the pension plan, she said, as retirees who are drawing on the Saskatchewan Healthcare Employees' Pension Plan no longer make contributions to it.</p>
<p>However, the policy change is causing concern among some employees in a system where recruitment and retention is an ongoing issue, say union spokespeople.</p>
<p>Nurses on some units in the health region have been telling their Saskatchewan Union of Nurses (SUN) representatives they are worried about the effect on their work load, as relief has mainly come in the past from retired nurses, said SUN president Rosalee Longmoore.</p>
<p>"The employer on one hand is saying they want to reduce the absenteeism, sick leave, overtime, wage-driven premiums," she said. "And (SUN members) are saying, 'The only way we get a day off is because of the retired nurses that have come back to work casual on this unit.' "</p>
<p>Longmoore also noted many health regions, including Saskatoon's, depended on being able to ask retired nurses to help with the mass H1N1 immunization program last year.</p>
<p>She said SUN would like to work with the health region to examine other options, such as a phased-in retirement, to better accommodate the knowledge transfer needed between retiring nurses and new hires.</p>
<p>Service Employees International Union-West (SEIU) employees are also concerned about the impact the policy change will have on the workplace, said SEIU-West president Barbara Cape. Many SEIU-represented sectors, such as technology jobs, licensed practical nurses and special-care aides, are experiencing a staffing crunch, she said.</p>
<p>"I'm not entirely sure their new policy is going to alleviate any of those problems," said Cape. "In fact, it might dissuade a lot of retirees from coming back, which is a double-edged sword."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Teach the joys of scriptural literacy</b>

</p>
<p>If my students at the University of B.C. and the University of Calgary are any indication, scriptural illiteracy among Canadian undergraduates has reached epidemic proportions. If it was this bad with AIDS, SARS or H1N1, we'd all be done for.</p>
<p>But as far as I can tell, nobody is crying out in alarm about scriptural illiteracy. And according to some of my students, their parents weren't concerned enough about this striking deficiency to teach their children the first thing about scripture.</p>
<p>I have the privilege of teaching the course on Scriptures of the Near East at UBC. I get to introduce my students to the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament and the Koran. I suggest to them that there is nothing they will read, watch or listen to which is more important than these three scriptures. I challenge them to take the time now to read through all three scriptures and become thoroughly familiar with them.</p>
<p>There is no question in my mind that if my students follow my advice, the experience of reading scripture will enrich their lives. I once sat in their desks at UBC, and I have been reading the scriptures ever since. It has certainly increased my appreciation of art and language and brought a helpful perspective on religious militancy. But -- truth be told -- reading the scriptures has brought me much more.</p>

</p>
<p>Winners:</p>
<p>ArcelorMittal Dofasco Pinnacle Best-in-Fair Award: Ian Coomes, 14, Grade 8, Appleby College for What's Growing on Your Uniforms?</p>
<p>Inspiration: Coomes was sick with H1N1 when he saw an ad urging people to cough into their sleeves. It got him thinking about bacteria on school blazers that needed to be dry-cleaned and a project was born. He learned that bacteria can grow on clothing.</p>
<p>Second place: Vivian Leung, 17, Grade 12, Abbey Park High School for Morphological and Functional Characterization of Lower Female Genital Epithelial Cell Cultures Grown in Different Conditions.</p>
<p>Inspiration: Leung took her cue from HIV research looking at how the HIV virus interacts with a specific barrier in the female reproductive tract. She wanted to understand it better so she took a testing model that has been used with similar cells in other areas of the body, but not on the reproductive tract. She then applied that model to the reproductive tract. She found it produced more realistic results than other models currently being used.</p>
<p>Third place: Calvin Rieder, 13, Grade 7, Oakville Christian School for Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink - Atmospheric Water Condenser To Provide Pure Drinking Water.</p>
<p>Inspiration: Rieder knew from camping that if you place a cup in a hole in the ground with plastic around it, water will condense on the plastic. He also knew millions are without water in Africa. So he decided to build four of his own prototypes to condense water from the atmosphere for drinking water. He tested them on humid air from the dryer. All were successful.</p>

<p>It's little-known that besides U of T, York and Ryerson, Toronto has another "university" of sorts that provides what its students figure is a well-rounded education in the life of pie.</p>
<p>Sure, it sounds a bit cheesy. But just as <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> has Hamburger U in Oak Brook, Ill., fast food competitor Pizza Pizza - the largest pizza chain in Canada - has PPU in Etobicoke, an academic and culinary training centre that boasts 3,500 "graduates" a year.</p>
<p>"I'm going back to school after 30 years and I'm loving it," says Suman Jairath, who is hitting the bright orange books at PPU with husband Chander. Together they are opening a franchise in Orleans near Ottawa after years of running an Indian food restaurant and working at The Bay.</p>
<p>As they've learned, pizza is an ordinary snack food for most folks, and many assume that ingredients are tossed on haphazardly, depending on who's making it. Wrong.</p>
<p>There's meticulous method to this mozzarella madness that keeps franchisees on their toes for six weeks in a red brick building located in an industrial park at Kipling Ave. and Bloor St. W.</p>
<p>It's equipped with 13 ovens plus food prep stations and a mock restaurant as well as classrooms for lectures and more formal study about all things Pizza Pizza.</p>
<p>For instance, you may think the key number associated with the franchise is (416) 967-1111, thanks to the ubiquitous jingle that has been around since 1975. (And if you remember from high school math class, the other number for Pi is 3.14).</p>
<p>At Pizza U the key sequence of numbers is actually 4-3-2-1, the formula for the single pepperoni pizza slice you would order at the counter, which always has 10 pieces on it. (That's four on the base just above the crust right on down to one at the tip of the slice.)</p>
<p>Similarly, a square slice always has five pieces: one in each corner and one in the middle.</p>
<p>A pop quiz that PPU's director of training Ben Campoli likes to give students - whose mornings are filled with classroom work and afternoons are spent in the test kitchen - goes like this:</p>
<p>"Hey guys: How much cheese would you put on a deluxe large classic?"</p>
<p>The chorus of eager pupils replies: "8 ounces." Correct.</p>
<p>"How many ounces of mushrooms?" To which they chirp: "Four." One keener who has clearly been studying the manual chimes in that this ingredient goes on last so that moisture can escape and prevent the pizza from becoming soggy. Good point.</p>
<p>"I had no idea there was so much to learn," says Haroon Arif, who works at a Pizza Pizza outlet in Scarborough and is training at PPU to become a manager at a new store in Keswick this spring.</p>
<p>The students begin their first week of schooling with a history lesson on the restaurant chain, whose first store was at Wellesley and Parliament back in 1967. The second week is more hands-on, starting small with rolling, stretching, saucing and cheesing the dough and making garlic sticks and garlic bread. Week three is all about making party pizzas, squares, wings, fries and chicken bites and learning how to clean the fryer and the filtration system. Week four focuses on the tricky and more time intensive signature pizzas such as Mediterranean and Chicken Bruschetta, and by weeks five and six they're really cookin,' spending most of their time at the ovens and prep stations and getting tested on their culinary acumen.</p>
<p>They learn the system top to bottom, from handling hazardous material and dealing with H1N1 to how to screw in a light bulb, literally, since special restaurant lighting is ordered from Pizza Pizza's central commissary along with all the franchisees' food and other equipment.</p>
<p>Courier Wadie Youssef, 31, doesn't think it's a mistake to take over a franchise in Montreal amid a struggling economy, although it's a significant investment.</p>
<p>"People still have to eat."</p>
<p>A piece of this variety of Pizza Pizza pie costs from $100,000 to $500,000 depending on the location, sales, condition of the store and its track record of profitability. The fee secures the right to own and operate a franchise in a given territory and the use of the Pizza Pizza trademarks, trade name, recipes and retail marketing plan.</p>
<p>After six weeks, Campoli signs off with: "It's been a slice."</p>

</div><div>By Helen Branswell   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>305 words</div><div>27 March 2010</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>American scientists have reported the first known case of H1N1 viruses that are resistant to the newest flu drug to hit the market, peramivir.</p>
<p>The case involved a person with H1N1 flu who first developed resistance to oseltamivir or Tamiflu. Because of similarities in the drugs' chemical structures, it was expected that viruses resistant to Tamiflu would be resistant to the new drug as well.</p>
<p>But the confirmation makes it clear doctors treating severely ill flu patients need to try to maximize the benefits of the few flu drugs available and minimize the risk of resistance developing, said Dr. Matthew Memoli, a physician and researcher at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and first author of the report.</p>
<p>Memoli suggested doctors can do that by giving more thought to the order in which they use flu drugs when treating seriously sick patients.</p>
<p>"If you have someone who's very sick . . . and you're very worried about them, maybe they're on their way to the ICU or you think they could be heading that way . . . maybe we need to go straight to peramivir," he said from Bethesda, Md.</p>
<p>The report, published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, also suggests resistance to these drugs in immunocompromised patients may arise more rapidly than might have been previously thought.</p>
<p>"While the emergence of drug-resistant influenza virus is not in itself surprising, these cases demonstrate that resistant strains can emerge after only a brief period of drug therapy," NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a release.</p>
<p>"We have a limited number of drugs available for treating influenza and these findings provide additional urgency to efforts to develop antivirals that attack influenza virus in novel ways."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ottawa recoups fees for vaccine lobbying; Contingency payment made to Dingwall's firm</b>
</div><div>Joanna Smith Toronto Star    </div>
<div>359 words</div><div>27 March 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star    </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The pharmaceutical giant that produced the majority of the Canadian swine-flu vaccine has to repay the federal government a prohibited fee paid out to a lobbying firm headed by a former Liberal cabinet minister.</p>
<p>Public Works Minister Rona Ambrose told the House of Commons that Wallding International Inc., a consulting firm owned by former Liberal health minister David Dingwall, received $350,000 as a contingency fee in 2001 for helping to secure a contract for pandemic vaccine.</p>
<p>The 10-year contract worth $323 million was awarded to <span class="companylink">Shire BioChem Inc</span>., and inherited by <span class="companylink">ID Biomedical</span> when it bought the company in 2004 and then passed on to GlaxoSmithKline Inc. when that company was sold the following year.</p>
<p>The contract obliged <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> to produce enough vaccine for the Canadian population in the event of a pandemic and states that the vaccine maker did not directly or indirectly pay what is known as a contingency fee - or "success" fee - to anyone for helping to secure the lucrative agreement, Ambrose said Friday.</p>
<p>But a routine compliance audit by forensic accounting firm Deloitte & Touche for Industry Canada uncovered evidence Dingwall's lobbying firm had received a contingency fee of $350,000 in November 2001.</p>
<p>An investigation at the Department of Public Works determined the fee should be recovered from the contractor, which is now <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> said the company was only recently made aware of the fee and noted it happened five years before it took over the contract.</p>
<p>"We responded promptly to the government's request for address," Michelle Smolenaars Hunter wrote in an email Friday.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the federal government has demanded repayment of a contingency fee in connection to Dingwall, who infamously told a parliamentary committee investigating his expenses as head of the <span class="companylink">Royal Canadian Mint</span>: "I'm entitled to my entitlements."</p>
<p>Another $350,000 fee paid to Wallding International for a contract involving pharmaceutical company <span class="companylink">Bioniche Life Sciences</span> was recovered in 2005.</p>
<p>Dingwall did not respond to requests for comment Friday.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'First responders' bulk of $100,000 earners; Municipal salary list shows who's being paid what</b>
</div><div>David Reevely   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen; With files from Meghan Hurley</div>
<div>800 words</div><div>27 March 2010</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the city workers on the annual list of employees making more than $100,000 a year are "first responders," says a memo from the city's director of human resources, including a now-retired senior police officer who took home more than $290,000.</p>
<p>According to the list for 2009, Supt. Knowlton Roberts made $283,980 in salary and another $7,837 in taxable benefits. The police service still lists him as the man in charge of operations in the department's central west and central east divisions, though Chief Vern White said Roberts has now left the force.</p>
<p>White said he couldn't talk about Roberts' pay specifically, but said officers have been known to cash out as many as 400 unused sick days when they retire. If Roberts did that, it would have dramatically boosted his salary -- which was a comparatively paltry $136,090, according to the previous year's disclosure list.</p>
<p>The chief himself was paid $250,205 in salary and $3,440 in benefits in 2009, according to the list.</p>
<p>In 2009, according to the memo sent to city councillors by the city's human-resources director Cathy Frederick (paid $149,599 in salary), the year's list had 1,140 city employees in all, including 405 police-service workers, 285 fire-service workers and 49 in the paramedic service.</p>
<p>The list also includes civilian employees and senior executives of those departments who aren't typically first responders to emergency calls.</p>
<p>That left 401 people on the list working for other city government departments, from library services to public health to managers in the water department.</p>
<p>As usual, the highest-paid city official was city manager Kent Kirkpatrick, who took home $311,133 in salary. That dwarfed the pay package of Mayor Larry O'Brien, whose salary -- diminished by an unpaid leave for his criminal trial last spring -- was $128,460.</p>
<p>Kirkpatrick's deputies were also among the highest paid. Steve Kanellakos, who is in charge of city services from recreation to firefighting, was paid $262,064 in salary. Nancy Schepers, who is in charge of public works, city planning and</p>
<p>OC Transpo, was paid $239,993.</p>
<p>Richard Hewitt, a former deputy city manager who was shuffled out of a job in a reorganization in fall 2008, was nevertheless paid $226,297, the list says, likely as part of his severance package.</p>
<p>Pierre Pagé, the city clerk who left his job in the same reorganization, was likewise paid $150,423 in 2009.</p>
<p>Doctors at the head of the public-health unit were also among the city's highest-paid workers.</p>
<p>Dr. Isra Levy, the top doctor who co-ordinated the city's response to the H1N1 swine flu, was paid $270,590 in salary. His deputies in the health unit are Dr. Nadine Sicard ($234,597) and Dr. Vera Etches ($222,216).</p>
<p>The other members of the city's $200,000 club are:</p>
<p>- Aaron Burry, the general manager of community and social services;</p>
<p>- Suzanne Gagnon, manager, social services centre east;</p>
<p>- Alain Lalonde, the auditor-general (his salary was $179,002, but he also got a $111,112 one-time payment to fill a gap in his pension after he moved from the federal government);</p>
<p>- Gilles Larochelle, a deputy police chief ($173,349 in salary, another $29,343 in taxable benefits)</p>
<p>- Giovanni (John) Manconi, the general manager of public works;</p>
<p>- Danielle Masse, the general manager of community and social services;</p>
<p>- Rick O'Connor, the city clerk and chief lawyer;</p>
<p>- Marian Simulik, the city treasurer; and</p>
<p>- Sue O'Sullivan, the other deputy police chief ($185,392 in salary, $16,440 in benefits)</p>
<p>Under provincial law, the city is required to disclose a list of all the workers who were paid more than $100,000 in salary, benefits and other payments each year. The line hasn't changed since the province passed the law in 1996, so inflation has pushed many workers into disclosure territory. The list includes dozens of police constables and sergeants, for instance, making between $100,000 and $120,000.</p>
<p>If the line had moved with inflation, the city would only be disclosing the salaries of people making more than $129,171, using inflation figures from the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the number of employees on the city's list for 2009 has fallen since the previous year, when 1,225 made the list. Many of the workers who've fallen off are firefighters, who signed a new contract that year giving them a pay increase that was retroactive to 2004. That meant they got a big lump-sum payment, temporarily putting them above the line.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Screen test for Atom Egoyan; 'It was a different kind of experience,' Toronto director says of his latest release Chloe, the first movie that he has not written or adapted himself</b>
</div><div>JOHN GRIFFIN   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>998 words</div><div>27 March 2010</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>E5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>You're forgiven for failing to realize Chloe is the first Atom Egoyan picture that isn't an Atom Egoyan picture.</p>
<p>It has got all of the famed Toronto auteur's themes down cold - the tricky dynamics of family; the odd relationship between appearance and reality; the slippery nature of truth; and sex, in all its canny manifestations.</p>
<p>Yet this is the first of Egoyan's films he hasn't written or adapted himself. It's taken from a script by Erin Cressida Wilson, a playwright who also wrote screenplays for the films Secretary and Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus. Egoyan is, if you will, a gun for hire.</p>
<p>"I started out in the 1980s doing gun-for-hire work on shows like Twilight Zone as a way of supporting my independent projects," said the director with typical erudite enthusiasm from Toronto this week. "But this is on another scale. I was handed the script by Ivan Reitman."</p>
<p>Reitman is the Montreal-born, world-renowned director and producer, most recently associated with son Jason on Juno and Up in the Air. His blessing on a project is enormous, which may explain the star power in Chloe.</p>
<p>Julianne Moore plays an upmarket Toronto doctor who hires an upmarket escort to learn whether her professor husband is really cheating on her. The prof is played by Liam Neeson. The hooker is Amanda Seyfried, the hot young star of Mama Mia! and Dear John.</p>
<p>"I've admired Julianne forever. I worked with Liam in the 2008 Lincoln Center remount of the Samuel Beckett play Eh, Joe, and he said he'd like to work together again. I cast Amanda before seeing her in Mama Mia!," Egoyan said. "I've always worked with great actors. These happen to be great actors who are also famous. On the set there was no attitude at all."</p>
<p>But there were challenges. Chloe conforms to the needs of a studio film, with a linear beginning, middle and end, another Egoyan first.</p>
<p>"My job was to shoot what was there. It was a different kind of experience, but I felt I could do a really good job. I was able to move the setting from San Francisco to Toronto, playing itself for possibly the first time ever on screen. And I had my own team."</p>
<p>With Chloe sold around the world and in theatres here now, is Egoyan ready to go back to his own projects?</p>
<p>"I'm taking some time off. I turn 50 this summer. I want to come back with a clean slate."</p>
<p>Jefferson Lewis's new film Outbreak: Anatomy of a Plague is a terrifying "what if?" scenario that imagines smallpox coming to contemporary Montreal.</p>
<p>Actually, "imagines" is an imprecise word. Montreal filmmaker Lewis need only look back to 1885, when smallpox blanketed our town, infecting 20,000, and killing 3,000, over 90 per cent of them French, and 85 per cent under the age of 10.</p>
<p>"People think it was the Louis Riel uprising of the same year that created the chasm between English and French," Lewis said. "But it was smallpox, and it was simply a twist of fate.</p>
<p>"If a visiting train conductor had been accepted to the Montreal General Hospital, the disease wouldn't have spread among the English population, which was generally inoculated against smallpox.</p>
<p>"Instead, he was sent to Hôtel Dieu, where it spread among the poor French Canadian population, who weren't vaccinated because the vaccine cost a buck a shot, the equivalent of a day's wages. And we had an epidemic."</p>
<p>Working from what he calls a "real page-turner" of a book by Michael Bliss called Plague: How Smallpox Devastated Montreal, Lewis moves smoothly between re-enactments of a 19th-century plague, and a 21st-century one that isn't supposed to happen, now that smallpox is theoretically eradicated from the world stage.</p>
<p>Using effective recreations, archival material and conversations with front-line workers, doctors, journalists and agency chiefs, Lewis effectively conveys what did happen and what could happen again.</p>
<p>"Amazingly, in the four years of working on this, only four people I met had heard about the 1885 epidemic. It was such an awful experience, no one wanted to remember it."</p>
<p>Lewis is one of those who believes we've come a long way since those days, and he's backed by a surprising number of experts.</p>
<p>"They all jumped on it, from the local level to internationally. Everyone has a strategy against smallpox. I know those who feel we overreacted to H1N1 in our immunization campaigns, and that the flu failed to live up to all the dire predictions. But did it ever occur to people one of the reasons it didn't cause more damage was because so many people got their shots?"</p>
<p>No Pollyanna, Lewis gently reminds viewers about the threats of bio-warfare, the recent examples of SARS and AIDS, and the real possibility that someone somewhere has the smallpox virus nestling next to the ice cream in their home freezer.</p>
<p>Or, as straight-shooting Teresa Tam of Canada's Federal Emergency Response Team says about jumping on potential pandemics: "I'd rather worry about over-reaction later."</p>
<p>Outbreak: Anatomy of a Plague screens at the NFB Cinema, 1564 St. Denis St., next Thursday and Friday at 7 p.m. in its French version, and April 3 in its English version, and on the Discovery Channel thereafter.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'Pig whisperer' urges an end to mega-barns - More freedom for hogs in Europe</b>
</div><div>By Adam Wazny    </div>
<div>588 words</div><div>27 March 2010</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>B10</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>The "pig whisperer" is trying to soothe an embattled hog industry in Manitoba.</p>
<p>Speaking at a panel discussion at the University of Manitoba on Thursday, Dr. Kees Scheepens, a veterinarian and sow farmer from the Netherlands, is an advocate for a less-intensive hog production system.</p>
<p>Dubbed the pig whisperer for his rather unique ability to 'communicate' with swine, Scheepens provided a European view on what the hog industry in Canada should aspire to look like, using his own backyard as the basis for his argument.</p>
<p>Scheepens said the Netherlands, a country of 16 million people and 12 million pigs, is a prime example of how a hog industry can work in conjunction with everyday life. There are some 2,500 non-corporate lots, with each farm containing about 400 animals.</p>
<p>On top of that, more than 75 per cent of those barns have made the move from a gestation stall configuration to a group housing, straw-feed system.</p>
<p>Smaller is better, according to Scheepens, and when you look at the environmental moves the Dutch have instituted over the years -- upgrades in both manure management and air washing to remove the smell -- while getting away from the mega-barn, his point gives local producers something to chew on. "How big does a company need to be?" he said. "Let's go back to a human size of industry and let's go back to a human size of farming. Let humans be humans and let pigs be pigs."</p>
<p>Vicki Burns, former director of the Winnipeg Humane Society who now oversees the Lake Winnipeg Watershed Initiative, wonders why the industry is waiting so long to make the switch.</p>
<p>"The problem is, when you keep any animal so confined for its entire adult life that it cannot even turn around, that is basically not humane," Burns said.</p>
<p>"We don't need to make the argument any more complex than that."</p>
<p>That argument, however, comes with a high cost. At a time when Manitoba hog producers are stretched to the limit by a drop in animal prices and any consumer fallout to a swine flu epidemic, moving away from gestation crates is next to impossible.</p>
<p>Marg Rempel owns a small sow operation near Ste. Anne, and at any one time she'll have about 5,000 animals in her barns. She is open to the group housing system, but changing over the stalls she has would cost roughly $1,000 per unit, so making the switch right now is a major financial concern -- and one that simply isn't in the cards.</p>
<p>"The change is (determined) by financial viability to move in that direction," she said. "For me to exist, I still have to be able to pay the bills."</p>
<p>In Canada, major producers (Smithfield, Maple Leaf) have announced they are phasing out the gestation stalls by 2017, perhaps making way for smaller, more humane barns in the future.</p>
<p>The movement towards a more wide-open space for hogs is already underway around the world. In Europe, all 27 countries have started the process to get rid of adult gestation stalls by 2012 and in the United States, individual jurisdictions have begun phasing out the stalls before the end of the decade. Major food service companies (<span class="companylink">Safeway</span>, <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>) have announced they will be buying more of their meat from farms that do not use the confinement crates.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>War of words over health bureaucracy -</b>
</div><div>By Larry Kusch    </div>
<div>311 words</div><div>27 March 2010</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>Are the costs of Manitoba's health-care bureaucracy soaring out of control? Or are they modest compared with other provinces?</p>
<p>It depends on whom you believe.</p>
<p>Friday in the legislature, Conservative health critic Myrna Driedger confronted the government with figures suggesting the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's hospital administration costs had increased 15-fold -- from $5.7 million to $89.8 million -- since 1999.</p>
<p>She said the total administration cost in all 11 provincial regional health authorities was $135.6 million in 2008-2009, dwarfing the cost of bureaucracy in 1999-2000, when it stood at $19.4 million.</p>
<p>"When we find out that moms in Swan River are having to go to Saskatchewan to have their babies because there's not enough doctors and nurses here, I don't think anybody out there is going to be very supportive of this type of skyrocketing (regional health authority) costs," Driedger said, calling the spending increases "obscene."</p>
<p>Health Minister Theresa Oswald did not dispute the Opposition's figures in question period. But in an interview a short time later she called the Tory critic's numbers "just categorically false."</p>
<p>All regional health authorities actually spent $93 million on administration costs in 1999 -- or 6.1 per cent of total hospital costs. Those costs grew to $153 million by 2009 (4.5 per cent of total costs).</p>
<p>Oswald said some of those administration costs also included certain patient-care functions such as infection control, patient safety, doctor recruitment and running the H1N1 vaccination program.</p>
<p>And the WRHA's administration costs are even lower than the provincial average -- at 3.1 per cent -- Oswald said.</p>
<p>The minister said last year the Canadian Institute for Health Information said Manitoba had the second-lowest hospital administration costs in the country.</p>

</p>
<p>Who: Sam DeAth, president of Sensible Life Products, the creators of Benefect disinfectant</p>
<p>What: Manufacturer and distributor of the first botanical disinfectant in North America</p>
<p>Where: 7 Innovation Dr., Hamilton</p>
<p>Since: 2001</p>
<p>Contact: 905-690-7474 or benefect.com</p>
<p>Sam DeAth's contribution to Earth Hour comes in a bottle.</p>
<p>Its contents can protect against killer superbugs and viruses -- but is naturally gentle and safe. He'll spray it into his mouth to demonstrate.</p>
<p>"I think people have a hard time believing," says DeAth (pronounced dee-ath). "We're kind of in the 'too good to be true' category with these products."</p>
<p>The Hamilton entrepreneur penetrated world markets less than 10 years ago with Benefect, the first botanical disinfectant in North America geared for industrial restoration cleanup from things such as fires, flooding, disasters, murders or trauma scenes.</p>
<p>DeAth has found success with a new focus in a personal care line called Clean Well. In the face of a deadly H1N1 outbreak, sales of the product proven to kill over 99.999 per cent of bacteria and germs exploded.</p>
<p>"Luckily we sell hand sanitizers," he says.</p>
<p>Clean Well was spawned four years ago from their Innovation Drive office. Now based in San Francisco with 18 employees, the consumer products maker focuses on bath and body works with hand sanitizers and antibacterial soaps.</p>
<p>The line moved back into Canada this year, hitting the shelves of 600 health food stores.</p>
<p>Sensible Life's engine, or "secret ingredient" found in each of their products is based on thyme oil. This active component keeps them biologically sound. It can be found in millions of products throughout the world.</p>
<p>Sensible Life has signed a deal with Seventh Generation, another manufacturer of personal care products, to launch in Canada this year. The American counterpart using their recipe is Nature Clean, a $150-million business featured on Oprah.</p>
<p>"Every step, we kept getting encouragement. From the business side or the personal side. People just kept telling us this is great," DeAth says.</p>
<p>Success has come with challenges in the face of aggressive competition. "We were labelled a disruptive technology. We were a big target," he says.</p>
<p>Alcohol- and synthetic-based manufacturers took every opportunity to criticize the company's natural method.</p>
<p>The formula was tested for three years in a microbiology lab and surpasses Health Canada's efficiency requirements.</p>
<p>It was originally concocted by DeAth's mother Joy, an aromacologist. The family was looking for products without dangerous chemicals to clean their home after his son Conor, now 12, was born with a genetic immune deficiency.</p>
<p>DeAth, who was developing search-and-rescue equipment for the U.S. military at the time, jumped on the opportunity to solve the problem himself.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ottawa recovering lobbying fees on vaccine contract; Federal government says terms of deal prohibited fees paid to consulting firm run by former Liberal cabinet minister David Dingwall</b>

<p>TORONTO -- The federal government is recovering $350,000 in what it says were prohibited fees paid to a Liberal lobbyist when a contract to provide the country's pandemic vaccine was secured in 2001.</p>
<p>Public Works Minister Rona Ambrose said Friday that Wallding International, a consulting firm headed by former Liberal cabinet minister David Dingwall, received a contingency fee from Shire BioChem to secure a 10-year contract to be the only supplier of Canada's pandemic flu vaccine. The terms of the contract, Ms. Ambrose said, stipulated there would be no fees paid, and if there was a breach, the minister could recover the fees from the company.</p>
<p>The revelation comes at a time when the government has signalled a plan to move away from the current model of having only one supplier for pandemic vaccines. The contract with a single supplier came into question during the height of the H1N1 pandemic scare when <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, which bought Shire, ran into vaccine production delays at a Quebec plant. GSK's contract expires next year.</p>
<p>Federal officials said Friday that a routine compliance audit done by Deloitte & Touche for Industry Canada uncovered evidence that suggested the fees were paid to Wallding in November, 2001. The issue was referred to Public Works and Government Services for an investigation, which determined that the fees should be recovered from GSK. The matter has been sent to the Commissioner of Lobbying.</p>
<p>GSK said in a statement Friday that it was recently made aware of the contingency fees paid to a consultant when BioChem attempted to secure a long-term contract with the Canadian government. The 10-year-old contract was worth about $300-million.</p>
<p>“This transaction took place five years prior to GSK's purchase of <span class="companylink">ID Biomedical</span> (formerly BioChem). We responded promptly to the government's request for redress,” the company said.</p>
<p>Mr. Dingwall could not be reached for comment Friday.</p>
<p>According to the lobbyist registration, Wallding International was retained by BioChem to lobby such departments as Health Canada, Industry Canada and the Privy Council Office. Wallding was retained to provide “strategic advice” so that the pharmaceutical company could be granted a long-term contract.</p>
<p>The recovered money, which will include interest of roughly $150,000, will be put into federal coffers, a spokesman for Ms. Ambrose said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Cruise ship season to open on April 26; Zaandam will lead off 228 vessels calling at Ogden Point until Oct. 3</b>

</p>
<p>The cruise ships are coming.</p>
<p>Starting April 26 with the 1,440-passenger Zaandam, Ogden Point will welcome 23 different ships from 10 cruise lines this year.</p>
<p>That's 228 visits in total through to Oct. 3 -- a record for scheduled calls, but the same number of visits as last year after some of the big vessels were re-routed to the Alaska run from the Caribbean after swine flu fears in Mexico.</p>
<p>"We're very happy with the numbers this year," said Paul Servos, chief executive of the Greater Victoria Harbour Authority.</p>
<p>"The Alaska market has improved and we are benefiting."</p>
<p>After losing market share to the Mediterranean and Caribbean markets over the last several years, the State of Alaska has offered incentives and lower fees to cruise lines to entice them back on the northern run.</p>
<p>Servos also pointed out an announcement yesterday by Transport Canada to adopt the North America Emission Control Area with the United States and France.</p>
<p>It requires cruise lines to significantly reduce nitrogen and sulfur oxide emissions inside the 200-mile limit, which Servos said protects the environment and helps to attract more passengers who increasingly want to reduce their own environmental footprints.</p>
<p>James Bay residents have long complained about emissions from the ships.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Holland America Line</span>'s Zaandam and Oosterdam and the Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Pearl will lead the way this year with 20 visits apiece to Ogden Point.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Endeavour, a pocket cruise ship, will also make 10 calls this year, including eight at Ship Point in the Inner Harbour.</p>
<p>The harbour authority said 428,438 passengers and more than 150,000 crew generated $70 million in direct spending in Victoria, with the money being spread around to restaurants, attractions, transportation companies, souvenir shops and various services.</p>
<p>Some of the cruise ships also order provisions and the shipbuilding industry benefits from small to full-scale refits</p>
<p>A typical visit costs a cruise line about $50,000.</p>
<p>The harbour authority expects to complete the new mooring dolphin designed to accommodate larger vessels in time for the first cruise ship. The $3.3 million project, about 70 metres off Pier B, allows Odgen Point to tie off the newer generation of ships that measure up to 335 metres.</p>
<p>- A complete cruise ship schedule will appear in tomorrow's Times Colonist.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ethical improvement</b>
</div><div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>581 words</div><div>26 March 2010</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Your chances of getting the straight goods on medical treatment stand to improve because of a move undertaken by hundreds of medical journals today. And it all began in Ottawa.</p>
<p>David Moher is a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute. He's an expert in the proper way for medical researchers to report their findings, and he says that unfortunately too many of them are slanting the results when they conduct random trials of various treatments.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's sloppiness. Sometimes it's cheating. Either way, you and your doctor may not have access to the facts about the pills you're taking.</p>
<p>Here's what happens: A trial sets out to find whether Drug X will make you live longer. Drug X fails that test, but it does have some benefit; perhaps it lowers your blood pressure along the way.</p>
<p>The scientist reports the good news about blood pressure but hides the bad news about failing to prolong lives. Sometimes, drug companies have even concealed entire studies that made their products look bad.</p>
<p>That's unethical, and this week the Lancet, the British Medical Journal, and seven other major journals jointly published Moher's guidelines for how to report drug trials properly and thereby give doctors and patients the full story. Another 400 journals have endorsed them. The guidelines include details on making sure the trials are truly random, reporting results accurately, registering trials in public so they can't be hidden, and disclosing who funds them.</p>
<p>Some critics of the medical-pharma complex will see all this as an admission that the research establishment is hopelessly corrupt -- that doctors and scientists are in the pay of big drug companies, trying to push pills at people who don't need them. We heard all that during the recent H1N1 flu vaccine campaign.</p>
<p>This is a great exaggeration, but the truth is that instances of questionable judgment aren't as rare as one would think. That medical researchers are confronting the problem head-on is a sign of health and strength. It can't be comfortable for a medical journal to admit in print that it published something with a concealed conflict of interest, or unsupported data. Yet by making the problem public, and by publicly adopting a method to improve, the journals are showing good faith.</p>
<p>And medical science isn't the only research area that has been forced to ask itself some hard questions recently. Climate science has come under even greater scrutiny.</p>
<p>It began with leaked e-mails in which climate scientists were discovered to have muttered angry things about their opponents. More importantly, the 2007 report of the International Panel on Climate Change gave unsubstantiated data on the melting of Himalayan glaciers, and its authors exaggerated future drought and food shortages in Africa.</p>
<p>When the IPCC stood up and retracted the mistaken parts, critics seized on this as proof that the UN agency had lost its moral authority to speak on this topic.</p>
<p>The opposite is true. As with the medical journal that retracted a falsified and misleading study on measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, the IPCC has done the right thing in admitting its mistake publicly and in trying to ensure it doesn't make the same kind of mistake in the future.</p>
<p>It's uncomfortable to admit errors, and probably worse to acknowledge the need for improved safeguards, but it's the only healthy way to work.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Rezoning is expected to give old school new life; Search is on for long-term tenant at unused Allancroft building</b>
</div><div>ALBERT KRAMBERGER   </div>

</p>
<p>Despite a recommendation from its planning advisory committee to reject it, Beaconsfield city council will proceed with a rezoning request to allow for a church or daycare centre to operate out of a former school building on Allancroft Rd.</p>
<p>The Lester B. Pearson School Board made the request to make it easier to find a community or non-profit group to lease the former Allancroft school, which shut four years ago due to declining enrolment.</p>
<p>"The school board owns the building but can't sell it for less than the municipal valuation, which is over $4 million," Beaconsfield Mayor David Pollock said.</p>
<p>"Since talks were going nowhere, they approached us to make a zoning change to allow for daycare or church group activities. This will make it easier to use that building.</p>
<p>"It's better used than lying vacant," he concluded. "It'll be better maintained and not look derelict."</p>
<p>Pollock said the city and Pearson have a good partnership, and the city hopes to lend the board a hand to find a use for Allancroft, which was brimming with activity last fall as a temporary H1N1 flu vaccination centre.</p>
<p>The mayor says nearby homeowners would rather see 80 daycare kids going there weekdays than the masses who came for flu shots seven days a week.</p>
<p>At its last meeting, council authorized the rezoning request but the amendment still has to go through a legal process that could take four months and require a public consultation, Pollock said.</p>
<p>As for the planning advisory committee, the mayor said there were concerns about the transitional nature of renting. "They preferred a more permanent solution for the building," he said.</p>
<p>Councillor Michael Montagano, head of the planning advisory committee, said Pearson's initial letter regarding the rezoning request was sparse on details but subsequent meetings helped clarify the situation and he came on board.</p>
<p>"It'll be good to have a daycare in there," he added. "There's a need out there."</p>
<p>The Allancroft building, constructed in 1960, now is zoned institutional and for school use. The 290,000-square-foot lot also features a soccer pitch, a pool and a small forest.</p>
<p>Pearson has put the property on the market, but with no deal imminent, the board is searching for long-term renters, chairperson Marcus Tabachnick said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Deficit magically shrinks; Higher revenues mean Duncan will announce new cash for colleges, universities, daycare</b>
</div><div>Robert Benzie Toronto Star   </div>
<div>984 words</div><div>25 March 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Premier Dalton McGuinty made a vague pledge on Tuesday that the budget would introduce relief for hard-hit northern residents and businesses over and above the help being earmarked for the Ring of Fire, a massive deposit of chromite (sample, right), which is used in the manufacture of stainless steel, that the government hopes will spark another Gold Rush in the north.</p>
<p>Hospital funding will increase but, as the Star disclosed on March 4, the Liberals will unleash a new "patient-based payment" system that would essentially force health-care institutions to compete for cash by doing acute care in-patient surgeries and treatments such as hip replacements more cheaply than rivals.</p>
<p>The five-year, $6.2 billion "Reaching Higher" plan for universities and colleges that was introduced in the 2005 budget is wrapping up, so a new funding program will be announced to bankroll an additional 20,000 places on campuses and in apprenticeships starting this September.</p>
<p>The roller-coaster ride for Ontario's budget shortfall continues. The budget was once expected to be balanced for 2009-10, then the forecast deficit ballooned to $14.1 billion last March, $18.5 billion in June, and a staggering $24.7 billion in October before ending up at $21.3 billion Wednesday. A plan will be unveiled Thursday to balance the books by 2017-2018.</p>
<p>Buoyed by an improving economy that has reduced the projected deficit by $3.4 billion, Finance Minister Dwight Duncan will announce new social spending in the provincial budget.</p>
<p>"We're in the springtime of recovery," an ebullient Duncan told reporters Wednesday against the backdrop of construction at Ryerson University.</p>
<p>"I am pleased to inform you that the 2010 budget will forecast a deficit of $21.3 billion for the year just ending - an improvement of $3.4 billion from the deficit forecast in last fall's statement," he said.</p>
<p>That shortfall is still a record for Ontario, but it's better than the $24.7 billion deficit on a $113.7 billion spending plan the Liberals had predicted Oct. 22 in the economic statement.</p>
<p>It's also good political news for Premier Dalton McGuinty, whose government faces re-election in October 2011.</p>
<p>The budget to be unveiled Thursday afternoon in the Legislature will outline a seven-year road map back to balance, meaning Ontario will be awash in red ink until 2017-18.</p>
<p>"You'll be hearing more about our realistic and responsible plan to eliminate the deficit caused by the global downturn, but I wanted to pass along today that we've already made some gains," Duncan said.</p>
<p>The largesse will be spent on 20,000 new spaces in universities, colleges, and apprenticeship programs and the continuation of 7,600 daycare spaces that had been threatened by an end of $63.5 million in federal funding, among other initiatives.</p>
<p>Duncan said the 14 per cent reduction in the size of the deficit is "largely due to better than expected economic growth as well as prudent planning of contingency and reserve funds."</p>
<p>"We're seeing upticks in employment, upticks in revenue, upticks in a variety of areas, but we still have a large challenge and that is to eliminate the deficit eventually," he said.</p>
<p>"It's pretty much across the board ... we're seeing corporate tax revenues up, we still don't have solid numbers on personal income tax, sales tax numbers are up from the fall." The absence of a full-scale H1N1 pandemic helped, since the government didn't have to spend as much as anticipated had the flu struck.</p>
<p>But Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak injected some reality into Wednesday's festivities.</p>
<p>Hudak pointed out that Duncan had warned of a $14.1 billion deficit in last March's budget, and then an $18.5 billion shortfall in a revised projection in June before October's ominous $24.7 billion announcement.</p>
<p>"This is the fifth number that they've put out there for the deficit for this year. Originally it was going to be balanced," he said, referring to 2008 forecasts before the global economic slowdown.</p>
<p>"Only a Dalton McGuinty Liberal would think a $21 billion deficit is some kind of an accomplishment."</p>
<p>NDP MPP Peter Tabuns (Toronto Danforth) said the changing fortunes at the provincial treasury are as much due to budget chicanery as the recovering economy.</p>
<p>"It is a big swing. It looks to me like ... they (exaggerated) the deficit when they brought out the numbers in the fall," said Tabuns. "Now, just before the budget they're able to say, 'Gee, we've managed well, it's a wonderful place, we've managed better than expected,'"</p>
<p>Until last year, the largest Ontario deficit on record was $12.4 billion in the 1992 budget introduced by NDP premier Bob Rae's finance minister, Floyd Laughren, at the height of a big recession.</p>
<p>Sources say the anticipated deficit of $21.1 billion for 2010-11 and the $19.4 billion for 2011-12 will also be lower than previously thought.</p>
<p>Along with the deficit-reduction plan, Duncan is expected to introduce reforms to the welfare system to stem abuse of the special diet allowance, which provides monthly stipends of up to $250 to some 162,000 Ontarians.</p>
<p>The Liberals argue the program, which has grown to $200 million from $6 million a year in 2003, is not sustainable and Auditor General Jim McCarter exposed misuse in his annual report last December.</p>
<p>Also in the budget will be an economic plan for struggling northern Ontario, which has been decimated by the closing of pulp and paper mills.</p>
<p>But unlike last year - when the 13 per cent harmonized sales tax that blends the provincial sales tax with the federal GST was unveiled - there will be no tax hikes.</p>

</p>
<p>This coming Sunday will mark the first anniversary of the detection of what is believed to be the initial U.S. swine flu case, a diagnosis that helped launch the greatest influenza vaccination campaign the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>Amid predictions the H1N1 pandemic could kill upwards of two million people around the world, governments rushed to vaccinate their trembling populations. More than 70 million people in the U.S. alone lined up to receive their shot.</p>
<p>Of course, we now know that the H1N1 flu was less lethal than even the garden-variety seasonal flu. One recent estimate is that the virus killed about 16,500 people throughout the world, not the predicted two million. The swine flu turned out to be more panic than pandemic, and about as fearsome as the Y2K scare.</p>
<p>Just as the reputations of computer experts took a beating when planes failed to fall from the sky in the first moments of 2000, the reputations of public-health authorities everywhere from the offices of the World Health Organization to the local flu clinic have surely been diminished because of their overreaction to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>And now, a provocative new study -- which casts doubt, not on the danger of the H1N1 virus, but on the very science of using vaccines to combat influenza -- can only increase the public's reservations. For some onlookers, however, such misgivings are nothing new.</p>
<p>As reported on the front page of this newspaper on March 11 under the headline "Flu shots futile: Study," a group of researchers, led by Dr. Roger Thomas of the University of Calgary, found there was no proof that confirmed influenza cases among elderly residents of nursing homes could be reduced by immunizing nursing-home workers.</p>
<p>The study's convenient "plain language summary" asserts, "There is no evidence that only vaccinating health-care workers prevents proven influenza, pneumonia and death in elderly residents in long-term care facilities." On the other hand, "Other interventions such as hand washing, masks, early detection of influenza with nasal swabs, antivirals, quarantine, restricting visitors and asking health-care workers with influenza-like illness not to attend work might [emphasis added] protect individuals over 60..."</p>
<p>Interestingly, the website of Cochrane Library, the respected organization that published the doubting Dr. Thomas's study, carries at least two other papers that reach related conclusions. One, studying vaccines for preventing influenza in the elderly, declares, "Due to the poor quality of the available evidence any conclusions regarding the effects of influenza vaccines for people aged 65 years or older cannot be drawn."</p>
<p>A second study, on the use of vaccines for preventing influenza in healthy adults, concludes, "There is not enough evidence to decide whether routine vaccination to prevent influenza in healthy adults is effective."</p>
<p>What gives? Phrases such as "no evidence," "poor quality of available evidence," and "not enough evidence" fly in the face of the dramatic, daily declarations that emanated from the mouths of public-health officials during the H1N1 scare last year. The Public Health Agency of Canada, for example, continues to declare unequivocally, "Immunization is the most effective way to prevent illness and to reduce the risk of transmitting the flu to those around you."</p>
<p>Maybe so, but one would think that, if that were the case, studies such as those led by Dr. Thomas would easily be able to confirm this. The fact they cannot is surely worrisome and is, at the very least, cause for further research.</p>
<p>This newspaper's coverage of the Thomas study said its findings had "added to a simmering scientific dispute over flu-shot campaigns." Canadians can be forgiven for not being aware of this "simmering scientific dispute," because, for the past year, the vast majority of news outlets in the country have been acting as little more than amplification devices for vaccination campaigns. Any controversy and conflict they reported was not over whether too much was being expected of the flu-shot campaign but, rather, whether enough was being done quickly enough to deliver the shots to Canadians.</p>
<p>The reality, however, is that there is a dispute, a fact made abundantly clear by a major feature story published in the Atlantic magazine last November. The well-researched article probed a crucial question: whether there was any solid evidence that flu vaccines actually prevent people, especially the elderly, from dying. The startling answer: They don't.</p>
<p>The article is worth digging up and reading, not only because of the important, iconoclastic information it relates, but also because of its revelations about how the scientific establishment has attempted to ignore, block and diminish the work of the vaccination skeptics. Parallels to Climategate and the now-boiling dispute over the theory of anthropogenic global warming are disturbingly strong.</p>
<p>Radical anti-vaccine activists, such as the ubiquitous Jenny McCarthy, may well attempt to use the new crop of studies to further their campaigns, but the public should not be misled into thinking that Dr. Thomas and his colleagues have found that vaccines are dangerous. Rather, they have simply -- but importantly -- shown there is a lack of hard, statistical evidence that flu vaccinations actually work.</p>
<p>Clearly, it is now up to agencies such as the WHO to show us concrete evidence that Dr. Thomas and the others are wrong. The public should no longer be asked to take its medicine as a matter of faith.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Alberta's 300 nurse hires challenged by union</b>
</div><div>Colette Derworiz   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>513 words</div><div>24 March 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Alberta's health minister says the province's medical superboard will have hired up to 300 more nurses by the end of this month, due to its massive $1.3 billion deficit being eliminated by the government.</p>
<p>Speaking on a Calgary radio talk show Tuesday, Gene Zwozdesky said Alberta Health Services will have hired 200 to 300 nurses from January until the end of March.</p>
<p>"There is what we call a hiring restraint within government of Alberta departments, but not with respect to health workers," he said. "We know that we need more nurses.</p>
<p>"This is a good thing," he added.</p>
<p>Heather Smith, president of the United Nurses of Alberta, said she's not sure where the minister is getting his numbers.</p>
<p>"There are approximately 300 positions posted on the AHS website," she said. "Of 297 jobs, only 24 are available to external candidates who aren't already employed by Alberta Health Services and the vast majority -- 19 out of 24 -- are for casual work."</p>
<p>Smith said the other positions are "internal churn," or people who already work within the health system taking on additional jobs.</p>
<p>Still, the hiring is a change from last year when the province stopped filling vacant health care positions and hunted for potential staff buyouts.</p>
<p>It comes a month after superboard chief executive Stephen Duckett said he'd be able to minimize layoffs this year and even hire new nursing graduates due to the elimination of the deficit and a cash infusion by the province.</p>
<p>Total health spending in the provincial budget jumps to $15 billion for the upcoming fiscal year, a 15 per cent hike from the current budget.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services, the Edmonton-based organization which operates the province's medical system, will see its share of the budget rise to $9 billion from $7.7 billion this year. It also receives a new five-year funding plan from the province that provides a six per cent increase for each of the following two years, and 4.5 per cent in each of the final two years.</p>
<p>Ken Hughes, chairman of the superboard, said AHS was operating under extremely difficult financial constraints last year and now has a different budget situation.</p>
<p>"We still have to spend resources extremely carefully," he said during an editorial board meeting at the Herald. "But there is turnover. People leave. It's the age of the baby boomers who are retiring as well."</p>
<p>Hughes said they are also continuing to increase the number of surgeries being performed so will need additional staff.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zwozdesky said he has asked for a review on the H1N1 vaccination rollout by the Health Quality Council of Alberta.</p>
<p>"It will address our preparedness for the epidemic. . . and our responsiveness to it," he added, noting it wasn't an investigation into the matter.</p>
<p>"How did we respond to this . . . because there will be a next time."</p>

<p>Q: I'm looking for a stat and can't seem to find it anywhere. The stat is games with at least a point. Can you help me out?</p>
<p>(Gord Buchan)</p>
<p>A: That sort of thing comes in our media game notes, where they list every Oiler and what they did from game to game (goals, assists, shots, plus-minus, minutes played). Here's the top five Oilers in getting at least a single point in a game: Sam Gagner has a point or more in 33 of his 67 games; Dustin Penner in 32 of his 72; Gilbert Brule in 25 of his 60 games; Patrick O'Sullivan 25 of his 66 games; Ryan Potulny in 21 of his 55 games. Ales Hemsky had points in 14 of his 22 games before his shoulder gave out, in case you're wondering.</p>
<p>Q: With a lot of undersized skill forwards here next season, is there any chance Georges (Laraque) could get his head on straight, come back and regulate like Sammy (Dave Semenko) used to do? I think he'd sooner play here than other players.</p>
<p>( Joe Morin)</p>
<p>A: The Oilers need a beat cop, like every team except, say, Detroit. They do have several small forwards who need to know they can do their thing, but if you saw Zack Stortini fighting Brad Staubitz, a very tough San Jose kid, and then the 240-pound Douglas Murray on Sunday, he's more than willing and more than capable. Laraque played a year and a half in Montreal, was hurt a lot (back) and didn't do what they wanted, so they will likely buy out the last year of his $1.5 million deal at two-thirds, spread over two seasons. Somebody else will sign Georges at $500,000. Will it be the Oilers? Might be. The owner, Daryl Katz, likes him. But there are going to be other heavies on the open market to help out Stortini, if need be. Like the six-foot-three, 228-pound D.J. King in St. Louis, who broke Derek Boogaard's nose in a recent fight. He's had some injury problems too, but he only makes $550,000 and is 26 years old.</p>
<p>Q: The Oilers are leading the league in man games lost to injury. I seem to think they've been horrible in this for the last several years. Is it the trainers or just bad luck?</p>
<p>(Kevin Meyers)</p>
<p>A: The Oilers have lost 431 man games and now Theo Peckham might be done for the last 10 games with a separated shoulder. It has absolutely nothing to do with Ken Lowe or his assistant, Chris Davie. Sheldon Souray broke his hand in a fight, and crashed into the boards in that race with Jarome Iginla and got a nasty concussion. J.F. Jacques's back surgery the first time wasn't successful. Khabibulin woke up one day with a bad back, and went under the knife. Hemsky's body has taken a pounding and his shoulder gave out. Peckham was tossed into the boards hard by Douglas Murray. Patrick O'Sullivan got slashed by Chris Phillips and it ripped off his nail. Ladislav Smid's neck had been bothering him since he was 16, playing for a Czech team. Could the Oilers staff have known about the swine flu? Like I said, it's not their fault. Sometimes guys play on crappy sheets of ice and there's a lot of knee injuries, but that's not the problem here, either.</p>
